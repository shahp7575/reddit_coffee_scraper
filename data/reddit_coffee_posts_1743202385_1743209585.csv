1jmaf34,https://www.reddit.com/r/50501/comments/1jmaf34/why_are_there_numerous_videos_circulating_online/,Why are there numerous videos circulating online that advise individuals of black or brown to remain at home on April 5th?,"Before I begin, I want to make it abundantly clear that I understand the situation. This is not the Black Lives Matter movement, nor should we expect them to be at the forefront of the fight. However, by not conveying the message that also encompasses the lives of black and brown individuals, we are effectively marginalizing them from the forefront of the situation and literally doing the opposite of what we talked ait years ago with removing POC from spaces. 

I understand that people of color are often disproportionately targeted by the police, and we saw this clearly during the Black Lives Matter movement. Instead of removing them from the situation, those who are not targeted or are less likely to be targeted or affected should be more vocal in their protests. Simply silencing voices from a protest does not amplify the message.

In the future, this leaves room for people to make ignorant remarks and claim that certain races weren’t present during such significant and important events.

I am First Nations, or Native American and gay. It makes no sense to me for my voice to be excluded from the situation because others should be leading the way. This would be similar to the situation with gay rights, where drag is not allowed simply because it could be mistaken for transgender or inappropriate or whatever excuse they use. Drag and Trans is a part of the gay community, just as the Browns and blacks are part of our society. You don’t have to be on the front lines; you could be sitting in a minority owned business sipping coffee, and tipping your glass to the rest of us if that’s where you feel comfy. The point is to be present and protest however you can. The same individuals who voted for him are the ones who accuse you of being lazy. This is simply not true. And as part of this movement, we need black and brown voices, especially with those voices being specifically targeted. Because they can’t tell the difference between someone who is Mexican and someone Indian and someone who is Palestinian. 

Please correct me or educate me if I have misunderstood anything at any point. I genuinely want to understand this issue.

1jmaev8,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1jmaev8/friendship_ended_4_years_ago_still_healing/,Friendship ended 4 years ago still healing,"Its been 4 years since i sent the damning text to cut this person off. Prior i had changed my number hoping theyd never get it but our mutual friend gave it and i had to send a message to leave me alone.

Context: 
Met this person in 8th grade different schools but same sports club. Became best friends. They were very open and strong 'christian' and I was exploring at youth church so at that age I was impressed they were so open. We played travel sports together but went to different high schools. Then went to same college for sport. Roomed in a house sophomore year together with two other friends and this is when things went south. I'd started to see we were headed in different life directions and saw some traits I didn't think were healthy but kept circling back to the friendship partly due to being on same team. Moved out of living together and thought it'd help but ...
 After 10 years of friendship I replied I was the door mat in the friendship, didn't have any emotional conversations that went deep and our friendship actually was a competition with our background and connection through college in sports. When they gaslit me and lied about so many things, hooked up with multiple guys with girlfriends and no guilt, always acted like the angel. I saw this all after college started after our friendship of 5 years but it was push and pull trying to leave the friendship due to playing on same team. We both had similar injuries which you'd think would bond friendship but it actually made it worse. The final straw was when I was finally happy my last year and met love of my life, I found out they made up a rumor of my relationships intimacy that I'd never told them. Mutual friend shared it like it was a funny joke and I realized those around me were all fake and backstabbing. Even after 10 years I thought id confront them and hope they'd own their gossip. It felt validating like I'd somehow felt their spreading lies without anyone telling to my face and they were so fake I never had proof until then. But I still thought of the years, and all we'd been through. When I confronted them, they word for word said (some alcohol was involved on their end) ""I've forgiven you so many times you don't even know. You've always hated me. You belive everything anyone tells you?"" And somehow ended it telling me they love me and shared struggles with their and their partners intimacy problems (realized theyd projected this lie onto me to our mutual friend) and hugged me saying I'd be in their wedding. I went back to my partner and was happy saying we talked it our and we were good but still had a pit in my stomach. They asked what was said and as I explained it I realized hearing out loud the toxicity and gaslighting. There is a lot more to the story but that was the day I knew I was done. It was extremely painful because this was right when I ended college and a lot of my other friends were tied to this person, and they were alpha personality so I essentially lost that group because I didn't trust anyone of their flying monkeys as it is called with narcissists. I actually did ask the week after confronting to get coffee and clear things up (as I had confronted at a bar in private and they were drinking, I wanted to hash it out sober and I also realized it was fucked how the first conversation went) and they agreed to meet but it never happened. They had claimed we were best friends early in the friendship and love bombed me and once I thought I was their friend they always made me feel worse. I look at those ten years and regret the friendship and decisions I made to put this friendship first... and I see so many red flags I wished my younger self recognized. It's now been  4 years since I've officially ended the friendship, they invited me to their wedding four years ago and texted me on my birthday and honestly it was the worst feeling in the world because my birthday was amazing and seeing their text literally made me feel sick. So I sent a text explaining how we aren't friends anymore, calling out the rumor they started and never took accountability for when confronted. Their response was in like 2 minutes,  and said word for word ""i am sorry you feel that way.  hope you find peace about this"" Then i looked at theur instagram because i knew after studying narcissim they would post piblicly some sort of cry as a victim and they posted a quote ""dont trest people how they treat you treat others as god treats you""
and that was when I realized they really didn't give a fuck. That there was so much more said behind my back that I'll never know to frame me as some identity to a the group they could influence and control, and I was just someone they wanted to be better than and manipulate. Hate to say it but to this day I still struggle here and there, and what kills me is how they literally just moved on to new supply and the ten years I gave my full heart and made life changing decisions I was too young to know were partial to prioritize this friendship was all fake.",1,1743209214.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False

Pearl and I have had a good run, but all things must end, and I began my in-person search today after work.  I have spent weeks looking at my budget to make sure this is this was economically feasible and was kinda excited about it.  I have always been fortunate enough to drive hand-me-downs in not-so-great conditions.  For example, during multiple polar vortices, I drove a vehicle with no heat in the Midwest.  Tempurates were in the extreme negatives....I understand my woes are the best outcome for some, but having a 30-minute commute was difficult to navigate.  

I (f) went into a well-known auto mega store and sought out a salesman, who immediately took me to his desk.  I told him my price-point and asked if he could give me some figures on what to expect price-wise. I made it crystal clear that I was not looking to buy today but wanted information. I also explained that due to student loan debt, I have a low credit score.  He (M 65-ish) immediately stopped writing, ran his fingers through his hair, and politely basically said, Come back when you have some money, ""sweetheart"".  He gave me a business card and showed me the door.  
  
Except for the sweetheart thing, is this normal for a car salesman to do?  The you don't have money right now so I won't help you?  I get that it's the end of the month and people have sales quotas to hit, and it might be a waste of time to plant the seeds for a sale next month, but it seemed odd to me that he didn't even take any of my information to follow up.    
  
I thought it was normal to ask a car salesman to help gather information like this, but I am not really sure as a first-time dealership buyer.

Additional facts:

I went in at 4:00 p.m. on a Friday (the shop is open until 9:00), so it's not like the dealership was closing when I asked.  He was standing around hanging out around the coffee pot, so he didn't appear to be busy with other tasks at hand.  
  
Please don't drag me for deciding not to use the money to pay the debt.  I need a car to make it to my jobs so I can make money to eventually pay the debt.  Without the car, I can't make it to work, and I lose my jobs.

1jmacod,https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1jmacod/cheaters_hear_me_out/,"Cheaters, hear me out.","Imagine you love coffee, but instead of brewing a fresh cup every morning and savoring it, you decide to skip the wait and inject a lifetime’s worth straight into your veins. Sure, you technically have all the coffee you’d ever need, but you’ve bypassed the experience that made it enjoyable. Instead of a comforting ritual, you’re left empty, having traded the joy of anticipation for a fleeting rush.

That’s like cheating instead of grinding in Monster Hunter. You might have everything instantly, but you’ve skipped the thrill of the hunt, the sense of achievement, and the satisfaction of crafting that perfect weapon or armor that makes a difference in your build. Instead of feeling rewarded, you just end up numb, waiting months for new content that won’t satisfy you—because you’ll just cheat that in too, chasing the next high with nothing to savor.

Please, try to understand what I'm saying. 

I know this won’t stop you from cheating—that’s not my goal, because I know it won’t. My goal is simply to help you understand why so many people are against it.

Too often, people complain about Monster Hunter lacking content, being too easy, or feeling boring, and I’m fairly confident a large chunk of those same people cheat. So I’ll say this: if you think Monster Hunter Wilds is too grindy, if you hate the cooking and ingredient system, dislike Artian weapons, feel there’s no build diversity, think the weapons are too weak, the story is terrible, fishing is too hard, or there are too many rules to follow… it really doesn’t seem like there’s much you do like.

1jmacey,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1jmacey/struggling_with_my_sisters_passing_and/,Struggling with My Sister’s Passing and Complicated Grief,"This is my first Reddit post. I’m really struggling with my sister’s passing just a couple of weeks ago. She was 29 years old, a drug addict, and for the last three years, she lived on the streets. We tried to help her many times, paying for rehabilitation, taking her back in, but it always led to problems for all of us... my mom, my niece (her daughter) and me. She would constantly fight with me, and I would fight back. Our household became hell because of her.

She had a lot of trauma growing up, including CSA. When I was around five, she SA’d me. I told my mom, and she confronted her, but we all kept living together. Years later when I was a teenager, my sister apologized. She told me she was full of anger and wanted revenge on my mom for ignoring her when she tried to speak up about almost being SA’d by a neighbor. She said she targeted me because I was the youngest and in her eyes I was Mom’s favorite. We both cried that day, and my love for her was bigger than my own trauma so I forgave her. But now looking back, I don’t think I ever truly forgave her.

What she did to me deeply affected me. I became hypersexual and made so many poor decisions in my life because of it. I’m 20 now, and I’m still healing from what happened.

Two weeks ago, I found out she had been found dead. She had already been dead for three days, so she was unrecognizable. People took pictures of her body and somehow, her daughter ended up seeing them. I didn’t see them myself.

The grieving process has been complicated. I feel a lot of regret because I was mostly mean to her in the last days of her life, but so were all my other siblings, I'd tell her not to come home asking for food, tell her to stay away from my niece’s school because the kids were bullying her. In town, she was known as la loquita (the crazy woman who wandered the streets) always high, but sometimes she was sober, and we had small conversations. Sometimes, she would just look at me and cry, and I could still see my sister there, buried under the addiction. 

A part of me used to think that everything she went through was karma for what she did to me. But now that she’s gone I’ve put my own pain aside, and all I can do is cry for her... cry for the life she was dealt, for how much she suffered. She was abused, started doing drugs young, and turned to prostitution. She never really had a chance. 

When news of her death was posted on our town’s Facebook page, people shared memories of her, how she would talk about her daughter and our family, how they would invite her for coffee or a meal. And it hit me that strangers were kinder to her than I was. I ignored her. I denied that she was my sister.

Now, I don’t know how to deal with this. Some days, I feel okay, but other days, I remember her crying when she saw me in public or when she watched me and our older sister sitting on the balcony as if she regretted everything and just wanted to be part of us again.

I don’t know how to move forward from this. This subreddit has help me by being able to relate to some of you so I wanted to share my own story. ",1,1743209016.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke. It was our song remastered",1,1743208529.0,Tik_tok_stories,0,1.0,False

Matched with this guy last Saturday, we vibe in the chat, we go on a date.

On date we have fun, even plan our next date while there, he asks for a kiss to end, I kiss him. Next day texts are less frequent but still fun. Then the Next day after that he says he just wants to be friends because there isn’t a spark and tells me he’s free next Saturday to get coffee.

My question is, can there really only be a spark on the first date? The guy seems to want to meet me again but as a friend. I’m a little sad (even though it’s one date) but I really did like talking to him and would be excited to have a gay friend (all my friends are straight guys lol) and would be excited of the prospects of a new friend with shared interests.

I do think he’s attractive and I think he thinks I’m attractive because he gave me like non stop compliments about my body and face during the date. 

You may be asking “why is this guy confused?” But could he be friend zoning me after only a single date just because he wants to slow things down for now?  Or is this a common thing in the community where gay bros make their friends through non sparked initial dates.

I would be happy either way because I did enjoy talking with him. Kissing was fine, I am a believer that romance doesn’t have to have an initial spark, but it can develop over time.",2,1743208528.0,gaybros,0,1.0,False

1jma5yt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jma5yt/aitah_for_standing_up_against_my_grandmother/,AITAH for standing up against my grandmother?,"Hello, I (18M) had a family reunion recently. For context, all of my grandparents are luckily still alive and in pretty good health, there's no need to explain how much I adore each and every single one of them. However, my grandma from my mom's side has been bugging me for the past few years about many things.

She usually always complains and refuses to listen to our advice, as typical parents do. The thing about her is that she negates every single tip that even my mom or my uncle give her, even my grandpa's words of wisdom, it's always what she wants. Well, throughout my childhood this rrally didn't annoy me, but as I grew older I started entering this circle of usual complaints against grandma, as she would constantly monitorize what I eat and how much time would I spend looking at my electronic devices.

Then, last Sunday all of my family from my mom's side, excluding my uncle, went to have breakfast at a typical coffee shop. Mostly everyone ordered an espresso, an orange juice or a toast, but I wanted to fill myself more so I ordered a small chicken, lettuce & onion sandwich. Even though I consider this a pretty healthy breakfast all things considered, grandma didn't think so, and kept giving me dirty looks from the other side of the table, and passive-aggresive comments directed to my mom like ""how do you allow him to eat something as big as that?"", or when my mother asked me why I was upset, saying ""it's because he knows what I'm thinking about his meal"". Although looking back it doesn't feel like much, it was enough for me to break, I told her, relatively calmly, how she isn't supposed to tell me those things, and that I'm old enough to make my own decisions, with the food I eat and with everything else in life, it's not up to her to decide how much I food I can eat. Even with this, I still left almost half of my sandwich on the plate and headed straight to the bathroom to diffuse the situation. After I came out, the rest of the morning was almost quiet.

After that, I chatted with my mom, who after herself experiencing the same exact problems with her, told me how I should never tell these things to grandma, as she is mature and ""will never change her views on life"". Up to a certain degree I understand this, but my mother is the person that has suffered the most from grandma's ""attitude"", and yet she still defended her completely, even if she agreed with me about how it's ridicolous how she complained about what I was having.

It's obvious that I love my grandma, I've spent my entire life basically being raised by her and the rest of my grandparents, as both my parents worked after school, and it sometimes feels like she makes specific comments to damage where it hurts most. Even with this, my mom might be right about me not having to tell her what I said, as it could be disrespectful.

I've had to apologize to her plenty of times, yet she hasn't apologized once for her behaviour. So Reddit, who is the asshole in this situation, and please lmk how this could be improved, because I'm genuinely tired of all these situations, thank you.",3,1743208470.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

I’m super excited (and a little nervous!) because I’ll be traveling to Switzerland for the first time this May and travelling in general for the first time! I'm attending a conference in St. Gallen (May 4–9), but I’ll be based in Zurich from May 9–16 for the rest of my trip.

Since I’ll be bringing a lot of stuff with me for the conference, I wanted to avoid the hassle of changing hotels or cities—so Zurich will be my home base the entire time.

I’m currently trying to plan my itinerary and would *really* appreciate any tips or recommendations, especially since I’m traveling solo and don’t drive:

Trains & Transportation

* I plan to get the Swiss Travel Pass for about 6 days. I’ve heard Swiss trains are amazing, but I’ve never used them. Do you have any first-timer tips? I'm going to be using the train from St. Gallen to get to Zurich with all my luggage, and I'm a bit nervous about it.
* Are there any scenic train routes I could try for a chill day trip? 

# Things to Do

* I’m into cultural sights, nature, beautiful views, chill walks, and beginner-friendly hikes (solo traveler here, not looking for anything too wild).
* I’d love to explore Zurich for one of the days, but I will also be planning a couple of day trips. I’m considering Lucerne, Interlaken, Bern or St. Moritz—are they worth it for a quick day trip? I want to see the Alps, too. I don't know I just want to see as much as I can.
* Any specific hidden gems or neighborhoods I should check out?

# Food & Coffee

* I want to try some good food spots, but nothing too fancy—I’m on a budget!
* Do you have any recommendations for cozy cafes, restaurants, breakfast spots, or local snacks in Zurich, St. Gallen or other cities?
* I’d love to grab a good hot chocolate or dessert somewhere too 🍫

I’m really just looking to make the most of my downtime after the conference and get a real feel for the vibe of Switzerland. Any help from locals or seasoned travelers would mean a lot. Thanks in advance!",1,1743207519.0,askswitzerland,2,1.0,False

Independent campaigns were structured around an April 12 election – and the decision to go later has added roughly $250,000 to required spending in each seat. By Mike Seccombe.

Ben Smith is more or less out of money. The independent candidate for the seat of Flinders, currently held by the Liberal Party’s Zoe McKenzie, is a genuine chance to win this election – but he, and others, spent their campaign reserves banking on an earlier poll.

April 12 seemed “fairly solid” as the election date, says Smith. “So we geared all of our resources towards that. You know, you don’t want to leave any money on the table.”

In the end, though, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese did not call the April election that many political insiders believed was likely.

On March 7, as Tropical Cyclone Alfred was bearing down on five million residents in south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales, he declared it was not an appropriate time to call an election.

“My focus,” he said, “is certainly not on votes … at this difficult time.”

With that announcement, Smith’s campaign was thrown instantly into chaos. He scrambled to work out how he might meet an extra month’s worth of electioneering expenses. This week, he found out polling day would be May 3.

“I mean, a couple of billboards on the freeway, that’s like $50,000 for a month. Another mail-out or two, there’s another $50,000. Digital advertising is pretty key, especially in an electorate like ours, which is broad for a metro electorate. So we’re talking maybe another $100,000 there. Plus campaign hubs and staffing … there’s another month of salaries on top of that as well.”

In total, he says, the delayed election will bring about $250,000 in additional costs, or about one third more than the campaign had planned to spend.

“And as of last week,” he says, “we had about $10,000 left in the kitty.”

Smith sees a lot of begging phone calls and trivia nights in his future.

His campaign has received funding help from Climate 200, which aggregates donations and distributes them to selected community independent candidates.

“Because they thought the election was locked in for April 12, they are now in a position where they have a gap in their budgets of between three and five weeks, and it is having a massive negative impact on them.”
Smith declines to say exactly how much Climate 200 has chipped in, but it is undoubtedly substantial and there will likely be more. At the 2022 election, the organisation raised $13 million from 11,200 donors and distributed it among 22 candidates.

At this election it is providing funding to more campaigns – 26 candidates challenging the major parties, as well as nine incumbent independents. Its donor base has quadrupled to more than 45,000.

Still, the delayed election has taxed its resources.

On March 11, the organisation’s founder, Simon Holmes à Court, told the National Press Club there was just $76.87 in Climate 200’s election account.

The situation is not quite as dire as he made it sound, as Climate 200 aims to distribute money as fast as it comes in. Still, it has not been coming in fast enough to keep up with the frantic emails being received from cash-strapped campaigns, which need money immediately.

Says Climate 200 executive director Byron Fay: “Because they thought the election was locked in for April 12, they are now in a position where they have a gap in their budgets of between three and five weeks, and it is having a massive negative impact on them.”

For example, one highly competitive campaign in NSW has bought space on local shopping centre billboards, carrying a message about grocery prices. The booking only runs until April 15, however. Extending it for another month will cost $45,000 and the campaign has only about a week to come up with the money.

There are numerous such appeals to Climate 200 for extra funds, to print flyers and buy media space, et cetera.

“And by extension,” says Fay, “Climate 200 don’t have the money, because we structured our fundraising efforts with an April 12 election in mind.”

It is understood the incumbent independents are generally in better financial shape, for a few reasons.

First, they have the greater resources that come with being members of parliament.

Second, as a campaign strategist for one of the sitting teals says, three years’ experience in parliament encouraged them to be more sceptical about the government’s electoral intentions and thus more prudent about spending money before the election was announced.

Third, the sitting teals already have high profiles.

Name recognition is far more important for an independent contender than for a party candidate, because a lot of voters cast their ballots for the party, regardless of who the candidate is. One of the biggest hurdles for an independent challenger is simply getting their name known.

“So,” says Ben Smith, “early money is important. For me, it was all about getting that name recognition up.”

Unfortunately for him, his spending peaked too early.

According to Fay, the delayed election brings the blessing of extra time for independent candidates to become known, as well as the curse of greater costs.

Polling commissioned by Climate 200 a couple of weeks ago suggests Smith’s name recognition was 33 per cent, which is good for a first-time challenger.

The poll also found he was sitting on 49 per cent of the vote after preferences. He’s a serious, if acutely impecunious, contender.

Climate 200 is currently blitzing donors with appeals. They expect money will start to come in with the election being called.

For Smith, it is mostly an issue of timing. He calls it a “cashflow problem” – more than an inconvenience, but less than a disaster. “We had a fundraiser over the weekend and raised about $50,000,” he says.

The late election has created issues for teal candidates, but for others hoping to sit on the likely large cross bench, it has been a blessing.

For the Greens, Cyclone Alfred served to underline a core message about the need for stronger action to combat climate change. It also provided another opportunity for the party and its volunteers to present themselves as providers of practical assistance, as they had done in response to the major flood that hit Brisbane a few months before the 2022 election.

The left-wing party’s electoral performance in traditionally conservative Queensland was one of the big surprises of that election. The Greens won three Brisbane seats on the back of a very effective ground game involving thousands of volunteers. In particular, the party won kudos from voters for suspending campaigning while the volunteer army was redirected to helping flood victims.

There were serious questions about whether they would hold all three seats at this election, but then Alfred came along to help their chances.

As in 2022, the Greens suspended campaigning for two weeks while MPs and volunteers helped prepare in advance of the cyclone and with the clean-up afterwards.

Across the three Greens-held seats in Queensland – Brisbane, Griffith and Ryan – the party’s “climate response teams” organised and deployed more than 500 volunteers. In areas at risk of flooding, they doorknocked and letterboxed thousands of homes with relevant information such as emergency contact numbers and shelter locations. They also responded to more than 200 requests for in-home help from residents, removed more than 20 tonnes of green waste and 15 skips of flood-damaged furniture, and provided more than 1500 free meals to residents who had lost power.

The small army of Greens volunteers ferried vulnerable people around and even undertook traffic control.

There is no doubting their altruism and community spirit, but not campaigning may have been the most effective campaign strategy for the party.

Stephen Bates, the Greens MP for Brisbane, will enumerate his team’s efforts in his quarterly newsletter to electors, going out next week. It features pictures of the MP filling sandbags before Alfred hit and cleaning up in the cyclone’s aftermath.

Across the border in northern NSW, where the party’s Mandy Nolan went very close to winning the seat of Richmond in 2022, the Greens responded to the cyclone emergency in a similar way.

The Byron Bay evacuation centre lacked basics such as tea, coffee and food. Nolan’s people provided them. In association with the Country Women’s Association, they also supplied food and beds to the Mullumbimby evacuation centre.

The Greens mayor of Byron Shire, Sarah Ndiaye, expedited the opening of the Ocean Shores centre when staff from the Department of Communities and Justice failed to turn up on time, leaving people out in the weather.

Last week, party leader Adam Bandt and climate adaptation and resilience spokesperson Mehreen Faruqi joined Nolan in the Northern Rivers to advocate for the spending of $1 billion a year for three years to fund a “climate army”. The proposed army would work with the National Emergency Management Agency, defence force personnel and “local service providers and volunteer groups” to better coordinate logistics ahead of similar disasters. They would also assist with the clean-up. According to the announcement, it would be funded by taxing fossil fuel interests.

We’ll soon see how Nolan and the incumbents go but, as the 2022 success of the Greens’ Brisbane candidates would suggest, the party can do well by doing good, and there is electoral opportunity even in disaster.

The delaying of the election by Cyclone Alfred may have benefited Labor’s prospects, too. This is despite the prevailing wisdom of the past few months, which said the government should go earlier to avoid having to deliver a budget awash with red ink.

In the weeks since Alfred, Labor’s poll numbers have gone up, while those of the Coalition are, by the description of poll analyst and commentator Kevin Bonham, “tanking”.

He wrote: “I think the cyclone-induced shift away from an April 12 election has actually helped Labor in that they can make going the full term look like the right thing to do rather than desperation. While the Budget may be a very hard sell, to put out a Budget anyway and say ‘this is how it is and we are making the mature decisions’ should look better than running away from the Budget for no easily explainable reason.”

Certainly, the Coalition has lost momentum over the past month or so. On Bonham’s analysis of six polls conducted since February 25, compared with the same polls before that date, the Coalition’s primary vote was down an average 1.6 per cent. Labor was narrowly back in front and its lead was “continuing to build”.

As to why the Coalition was performing worse, various observers cite various reasons. Greens leader Adam Bandt suggests the opposition leader’s abandonment of his Dickson electorate during the cyclone to attend a party fundraiser in Sydney was one factor.

While his party’s MPs and volunteers were “filling sandbags and assisting people who couldn’t necessarily assist themselves to prepare for the worst”, says Bandt, “Peter Dutton went AWOL”.

“It certainly exposed him,” he says. “While we were helping our communities, he was fundraising the billionaires. That has certainly been noticed.”

Paul Smith, director of public data with YouGov, nominates another factor in the Coalition’s decline: the perceived similarities between some of the Coalition’s policies and those of the Trump regime in America.

“Polls up until February were a referendum on the government,” he says. “Now they’ve become a choice, particularly since Zelensky versus Trump.”

As Australians woke up to the reality of what was happening in America, Smith says, they took a “fresh look at Peter Dutton”.

This coincided with Dutton talking about cracking down on working from home and radically cutting public sector jobs.

According to Smith, Dutton’s promise to fire 41,000 public servants was not popular with the electorate. It didn’t matter that his target was “Canberra public servants”. As Smith points out, “workers see themselves as workers”.

Dutton’s narrow path to the prime ministership, he says, “runs through outer-suburban, working-class seats. That’s his biggest strategy, and his policies like work from home, sacking workers, are unpopular with the people whose votes he is seeking.

“There’s been a small but decisive shift in support caused by people looking at Dutton’s workplace policies and not liking what they see.”

Other pollsters and analysts also question the appeal of recent Dutton announcements, particularly to younger voters. Kos Samaras, director of strategy and analytics with RedBridge Group, finds some of Dutton’s choices more than a little strange.

“These voters, Millennials and Gen Z, people 45 years and younger, are now focusing on the election, and they’re saying, ‘Well, I’m not really happy with Labor, but these other bozos are not offering much either. They seem to be talking weirdo stuff, like deporting people and sacking public servants. What about the economy, people?’ ”

Since The Saturday Paper spoke to Samaras, the major parties have come back to focusing on the main game: the cost of living. Still, their offerings have been uninspiring.

In Labor’s case, there is a tiny tax cut that doesn’t apply until more than a year from now and gives just $268 in the first 12 months and $536 after that. The Coalition has said it would repeal the cut if it won government.

On its own side, the Coalition has promised a 25.4 cents per litre cut in the excise on petrol and diesel, which will expire after 12 months and which has been roundly condemned by economists as a “sugar hit” that will disproportionately benefit higher-income earners.

Meanwhile, a storm looms, which could have a far greater impact on the lives of Australians: the Trump administration’s threatened tariffs. The election that was delayed by Cyclone Alfred may yet be blown off course by Hurricane Donald.

1jm9tv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnabashedVoice/comments/1jm9tv8/the_unorthodox_battalion/,The Unorthodox Battalion,"Captain Lir'Vex of the Cassian Resistance watched in bewilderment as the human mercenaries prepared for the upcoming assault on Governor Kel'Mar's stronghold. After three generations of brutal civil war against the oligarchs who had seized control of their world, the Cassians were exhausted, their tactics predictable, their resources depleted. In desperation, they had spent their last reserves of currency hiring a small battalion of humans—a species known throughout the galaxy for their strange mixture of primitive technology and inexplicable survival rates.

""Captain, with all due respect,"" said Commander Sarah Chen, the human leader, as she rummaged through a pile of scavenged material that the Cassians had considered trash, ""your tactical approach needs some serious revision.""

""Our approaches have been refined through generations of conflict,"" Lir'Vex replied stiffly, his four arms crossed in defensive posture. ""We've calculated every variable.""

Chen snorted. ""That's exactly your problem. Your enemy has calculated the same variables. You're fighting a mathematical equation that always results in stalemate.""

The human soldiers were doing the strangest things. Some were dismantling the temperature regulators from abandoned buildings. Others were collecting tubes of adhesive normally used for structural repairs. One was even harvesting the membranes from local flora. Lir'Vex couldn't make sense of any of it.

""What is the purpose of this... scavenging?"" he asked, mandibles clicking with concern.

""Improvisation,"" Chen replied with a grin that revealed her flat, herbivore-like teeth. ""The thing about humans is that we don't fight fair, and we don't fight according to the manual. Now, show me your intelligence reports about the stronghold's defenses.""

Governor Kel'Mar's fortress was considered impenetrable. Built into the side of Mount Xarian, it had withstood seventeen major assaults over the past fifty years. Its automated defense systems had been programmed with every known Cassian battle tactic. Its shield generators were powered by the geothermal energy of the mountain itself. The only accessible entrance was a heavily fortified checkpoint that scanned for organic signatures and weapon signatures simultaneously.

""We've lost over ten thousand soldiers trying to breach that entrance,"" Lir'Vex explained as they observed the fortress from a distance.

""Then we won't use the entrance,"" Chen replied, studying the mountain through high-powered binoculars. ""Tell me about the ventilation systems.""

""Heavily filtered and protected. They're designed to detect and neutralize any biological agent that doesn't match authorized genetic profiles.""

Chen lowered her binoculars. ""What about non-biological agents? Temperature? Sound? Vibration?""

Lir'Vex blinked all six eyes in confusion. ""I don't understand.""

""You will,"" she said, turning to her squad. ""Torres, what have you got for me?""

A wiry human with dark hair held up what appeared to be a hodgepodge of parts. ""Makeshift resonance amplifiers, Commander. Combined with the native flora membranes, we can create infrasound generators that'll mess with their inner ear equivalents. Won't kill anyone, but it'll make them wish they were dead.""

""Perfect. Jackson, status on the thermal disruptors?""

Another human, broad-shouldered and with a scar across her face, grinned. ""Ready to go, Commander. Once we introduce these into their ventilation, the temperature sensors will go haywire. System will think there's a fire when there isn't, or vice versa.""

""And the adhesive bombs?""

""Just need to add the catalysts,"" said a third human. ""They'll solidify any liquid within a five-meter radius. Water, blood, hydraulic fluid—you name it, it becomes gel in seconds.""

Lir'Vex's antennae twitched nervously. ""None of these are conventional weapons. The defense systems will—""

""Not recognize them,"" Chen finished. ""That's the point. Your enemy has prepared for every conventional attack. We're going unconventional.""

The attack began at dusk.

The human called Torres released small, drone-like devices constructed from salvaged parts into the air. They hovered silently, carrying their makeshift resonance amplifiers toward the fortress's ventilation ducts.

""The filters will catch them,"" Lir'Vex warned.

""They're not trying to get through the filters,"" Chen explained. ""They're using the filters as amplifiers.""

Soon, the infrasound generators activated. Though inaudible to most species, the vibrations they produced caused immediate disorientation among the fortress guards. Security footage hacked by the resistance showed guards stumbling, clutching their hearing organs, some collapsing entirely.

Next came the thermal disruptors, carefully calibrated to disrupt rather than destroy. The fortress's environmental systems began responding to phantom temperature spikes, triggering emergency protocols that further disoriented the defenders.

""Now for phase three,"" Chen announced.

Three humans wearing improvised protective gear approached the fortress from different angles, each carrying what looked like modified agricultural sprayers. They targeted external sensor arrays and weapon emplacements, spraying them with the adhesive compound. As the adhesive made contact with the morning dew on the metal surfaces, it expanded rapidly, encasing delicate machinery in impenetrable gel.

""You've disabled their external defenses,"" Lir'Vex observed, astonishment evident in his voice. ""But the internal security forces—""

""Are currently dealing with what they think is a system-wide malfunction,"" Chen finished. ""No one's thinking 'attack' because none of their attack indicators are triggered. They're running diagnostics instead of battle stations.""

As if on cue, the massive doors of the checkpoint slid open. Security forces emerged, sweating and disoriented, some removing helmets to escape the phantom heat their systems were reporting.

""Perfect,"" Chen murmured. She raised her hand, revealing a simple remote detonator. ""And now for the finale.""

She pressed the button. Nothing seemed to happen for several seconds.

Then, from the scattered piles of refuse that her soldiers had strategically positioned days earlier, erupted clouds of fine, sparkling dust. The particles drifted toward the open checkpoint, carried by the evening breeze.

""What is that?"" Lir'Vex asked.

""Crystallized sweetener from your native fruits, combined with a particular pollen that your intelligence reports mentioned the oligarchs are universally allergic to. Harmless to everyone else, but for them...""

Within minutes, the security forces were incapacitated—not by lethal force, but by uncontrollable sneezing fits and watery eyes. The defensive formation broke down completely as elite soldiers were reduced to helpless, wheezing heaps.

""Now we move,"" Chen ordered. ""Non-lethal takedown. Remember, these are just people following orders.""

Two hours later, Governor Kel'Mar stood in custody of the resistance, his administrative center secured with minimal casualties.

""I don't understand,"" the governor wheezed, still suffering from the effects of the pollen. ""Our systems were designed to counter every known weapon, every possible attack vector.""

""That's your problem,"" Chen said, casually leaning against what had once been his ornate desk. ""You prepared for weapons. We used trash.""

Later, as the resistance fighters secured the fortress and began the process of transitioning power back to the people, Lir'Vex approached Chen.

""Your methods were... unorthodox,"" the Cassian admitted. ""Throughout our history, we've approached warfare as a science, a equation to be solved. You humans treated it as... what? Art?""

Chen considered this as she helped her team pack up their improvised gear. ""Not art. Survival. Humans come from a world where we were rarely the strongest or fastest species. We couldn't outfight our predators, so we had to outthink them. When conventional approaches fail, we improvise. We see possibilities in junk. We turn weaknesses into strengths.""

She handed Lir'Vex one of the makeshift resonance amplifiers. ""Keep this. Not as a weapon, but as a reminder. Sometimes the solution isn't finding a bigger gun—it's rethinking the problem entirely.""

Lir'Vex accepted the device, turning it over in his four hands with newfound respect. ""The oligarchs have controlled our planet for three generations because they controlled the narrative. They convinced us that liberation was mathematically impossible.""

""And that,"" Chen said with a smile, ""is why you don't send mathematicians to do a scavenger's job.""

*Three months later*

The Galactic Mercenary Guild received an unusual report from Commander Sarah Chen's human battalion—their third consecutive successful campaign for the Cassian Resistance. The report included a peculiar addendum:

""Cassian resistance forces now employing human-inspired tactics. Request additional compensation for training services beyond original combat contract. Also request extended supply of Earth coffee, as Cassians have developed a concerning addiction after observing its effects on human improvisational capabilities.""

The Guild administrator, a veteran of seventeen campaigns himself, chuckled as he stamped the request ""APPROVED."" Humans, he reflected as he sipped his own cup of coffee, had a knack for turning even warfare into a teachable moment.

For example, one highly competitive campaign in NSW has bought space on local shopping centre billboards, carrying a message about grocery prices. The booking only runs until April 15, however. Extending it for another month will cost $45,000 and the campaign has only about a week to come up with the money.

There are numerous such appeals to Climate 200 for extra funds, to print flyers and buy media space, et cetera.

“And by extension,” says Fay, “Climate 200 don’t have the money, because we structured our fundraising efforts with an April 12 election in mind.”

It is understood the incumbent independents are generally in better financial shape, for a few reasons.

First, they have the greater resources that come with being members of parliament.

Second, as a campaign strategist for one of the sitting teals says, three years’ experience in parliament encouraged them to be more sceptical about the government’s electoral intentions and thus more prudent about spending money before the election was announced.

Third, the sitting teals already have high profiles.

Name recognition is far more important for an independent contender than for a party candidate, because a lot of voters cast their ballots for the party, regardless of who the candidate is. One of the biggest hurdles for an independent challenger is simply getting their name known.

“So,” says Ben Smith, “early money is important. For me, it was all about getting that name recognition up.”

Unfortunately for him, his spending peaked too early.

According to Fay, the delayed election brings the blessing of extra time for independent candidates to become known, as well as the curse of greater costs.

Polling commissioned by Climate 200 a couple of weeks ago suggests Smith’s name recognition was 33 per cent, which is good for a first-time challenger.

The poll also found he was sitting on 49 per cent of the vote after preferences. He’s a serious, if acutely impecunious, contender.

Climate 200 is currently blitzing donors with appeals. They expect money will start to come in with the election being called.

For Smith, it is mostly an issue of timing. He calls it a “cashflow problem” – more than an inconvenience, but less than a disaster. “We had a fundraiser over the weekend and raised about $50,000,” he says.

The late election has created issues for teal candidates, but for others hoping to sit on the likely large cross bench, it has been a blessing.

For the Greens, Cyclone Alfred served to underline a core message about the need for stronger action to combat climate change. It also provided another opportunity for the party and its volunteers to present themselves as providers of practical assistance, as they had done in response to the major flood that hit Brisbane a few months before the 2022 election.

The left-wing party’s electoral performance in traditionally conservative Queensland was one of the big surprises of that election. The Greens won three Brisbane seats on the back of a very effective ground game involving thousands of volunteers. In particular, the party won kudos from voters for suspending campaigning while the volunteer army was redirected to helping flood victims.

There were serious questions about whether they would hold all three seats at this election, but then Alfred came along to help their chances.

As in 2022, the Greens suspended campaigning for two weeks while MPs and volunteers helped prepare in advance of the cyclone and with the clean-up afterwards.

Across the three Greens-held seats in Queensland – Brisbane, Griffith and Ryan – the party’s “climate response teams” organised and deployed more than 500 volunteers. In areas at risk of flooding, they doorknocked and letterboxed thousands of homes with relevant information such as emergency contact numbers and shelter locations. They also responded to more than 200 requests for in-home help from residents, removed more than 20 tonnes of green waste and 15 skips of flood-damaged furniture, and provided more than 1500 free meals to residents who had lost power.

The small army of Greens volunteers ferried vulnerable people around and even undertook traffic control.

There is no doubting their altruism and community spirit, but not campaigning may have been the most effective campaign strategy for the party.

Stephen Bates, the Greens MP for Brisbane, will enumerate his team’s efforts in his quarterly newsletter to electors, going out next week. It features pictures of the MP filling sandbags before Alfred hit and cleaning up in the cyclone’s aftermath.

Across the border in northern NSW, where the party’s Mandy Nolan went very close to winning the seat of Richmond in 2022, the Greens responded to the cyclone emergency in a similar way.

The Byron Bay evacuation centre lacked basics such as tea, coffee and food. Nolan’s people provided them. In association with the Country Women’s Association, they also supplied food and beds to the Mullumbimby evacuation centre.

The Greens mayor of Byron Shire, Sarah Ndiaye, expedited the opening of the Ocean Shores centre when staff from the Department of Communities and Justice failed to turn up on time, leaving people out in the weather.

Last week, party leader Adam Bandt and climate adaptation and resilience spokesperson Mehreen Faruqi joined Nolan in the Northern Rivers to advocate for the spending of $1 billion a year for three years to fund a “climate army”. The proposed army would work with the National Emergency Management Agency, defence force personnel and “local service providers and volunteer groups” to better coordinate logistics ahead of similar disasters. They would also assist with the clean-up. According to the announcement, it would be funded by taxing fossil fuel interests.

We’ll soon see how Nolan and the incumbents go but, as the 2022 success of the Greens’ Brisbane candidates would suggest, the party can do well by doing good, and there is electoral opportunity even in disaster.

The delaying of the election by Cyclone Alfred may have benefited Labor’s prospects, too. This is despite the prevailing wisdom of the past few months, which said the government should go earlier to avoid having to deliver a budget awash with red ink.

In the weeks since Alfred, Labor’s poll numbers have gone up, while those of the Coalition are, by the description of poll analyst and commentator Kevin Bonham, “tanking”.

He wrote: “I think the cyclone-induced shift away from an April 12 election has actually helped Labor in that they can make going the full term look like the right thing to do rather than desperation. While the Budget may be a very hard sell, to put out a Budget anyway and say ‘this is how it is and we are making the mature decisions’ should look better than running away from the Budget for no easily explainable reason.”

Certainly, the Coalition has lost momentum over the past month or so. On Bonham’s analysis of six polls conducted since February 25, compared with the same polls before that date, the Coalition’s primary vote was down an average 1.6 per cent. Labor was narrowly back in front and its lead was “continuing to build”.

As to why the Coalition was performing worse, various observers cite various reasons. Greens leader Adam Bandt suggests the opposition leader’s abandonment of his Dickson electorate during the cyclone to attend a party fundraiser in Sydney was one factor.

While his party’s MPs and volunteers were “filling sandbags and assisting people who couldn’t necessarily assist themselves to prepare for the worst”, says Bandt, “Peter Dutton went AWOL”.

“It certainly exposed him,” he says. “While we were helping our communities, he was fundraising the billionaires. That has certainly been noticed.”

Paul Smith, director of public data with YouGov, nominates another factor in the Coalition’s decline: the perceived similarities between some of the Coalition’s policies and those of the Trump regime in America.

“Polls up until February were a referendum on the government,” he says. “Now they’ve become a choice, particularly since Zelensky versus Trump.”

As Australians woke up to the reality of what was happening in America, Smith says, they took a “fresh look at Peter Dutton”.

This coincided with Dutton talking about cracking down on working from home and radically cutting public sector jobs.

According to Smith, Dutton’s promise to fire 41,000 public servants was not popular with the electorate. It didn’t matter that his target was “Canberra public servants”. As Smith points out, “workers see themselves as workers”.

Dutton’s narrow path to the prime ministership, he says, “runs through outer-suburban, working-class seats. That’s his biggest strategy, and his policies like work from home, sacking workers, are unpopular with the people whose votes he is seeking.

“There’s been a small but decisive shift in support caused by people looking at Dutton’s workplace policies and not liking what they see.”

Other pollsters and analysts also question the appeal of recent Dutton announcements, particularly to younger voters. Kos Samaras, director of strategy and analytics with RedBridge Group, finds some of Dutton’s choices more than a little strange.

“These voters, Millennials and Gen Z, people 45 years and younger, are now focusing on the election, and they’re saying, ‘Well, I’m not really happy with Labor, but these other bozos are not offering much either. They seem to be talking weirdo stuff, like deporting people and sacking public servants. What about the economy, people?’ ”

Since The Saturday Paper spoke to Samaras, the major parties have come back to focusing on the main game: the cost of living. Still, their offerings have been uninspiring.

In Labor’s case, there is a tiny tax cut that doesn’t apply until more than a year from now and gives just $268 in the first 12 months and $536 after that. The Coalition has said it would repeal the cut if it won government.

On its own side, the Coalition has promised a 25.4 cents per litre cut in the excise on petrol and diesel, which will expire after 12 months and which has been roundly condemned by economists as a “sugar hit” that will disproportionately benefit higher-income earners.

Meanwhile, a storm looms, which could have a far greater impact on the lives of Australians: the Trump administration’s threatened tariffs. The election that was delayed by Cyclone Alfred may yet be blown off course by Hurricane Donald.

Gist of thread is my disappointment with it. 

--

So I've finished my second playthrough of Veilguard, first romancing Davrin (no strong preference for me there, he just really fit with my Rook). However,  I went into my second playthrough excited for my Rogue Crow!Rook to romance Lucanis.

I'd already heard it was severely lacking, so I went in with fairly low expectations. But having just finished it... God I'm disappointed. 

And this isn't coming from a 'I hate veilguard' or 'omg where's the sex' standpoint, but just a general physical and emotional intimacy perspective. It felt like I was getting edged for a single shred of intimacy between them. A brush of the hand, Lucanis stroking Rook's cheek, I'd have taken ANY of it. But no - just a lot of not great flirting dialogue, a lot of coffee,  and Lucanis standing over Rook staring lovingly down at you while refusing to invade your apparently unbreachable personal bubble. 

You get blue-balled twice for that 'I want you but I shouldn't' first kiss with barely any real interaction or engagement inbetween (and don't get me started on his and Neve's flirty dialogue playing out super late into the romance). Then you finally get that kiss and it's the fastest fade to black I've ever witnessed!

I don't need to see them raw dogging, but you could have given us a little more pay-off than that! It was almost worse that Lucanis was so passionate and sincere with his dialogue but it never reflected in any proper interaction.  And even Rook's dialogue with him was so... default. 

I've heard great things about Emmeric's romance,  so he's next in line after a break from the game, but I really needed to vent from this experience.  I really loved Lucanis' character, especially with Spite, but there was so much abandoned potential it almost felt like a wasted playthrough, especially since you need to play literally the whole game to get their one proper scene together.

1jm9mju,https://www.reddit.com/r/PureLuxy/comments/1jm9mju/best_floor_lamp_for_reading_chair_illuminate_your/,Best Floor Lamp for Reading Chair: Illuminate Your Space with Style and Function,"When it comes to creating the perfect reading nook, lighting plays a crucial role. A well-placed [**floor lamp for a reading chair**](https://pureluxy.com/floor-lamp-for-reading-chair/) can enhance your reading experience, reducing eye strain while adding a touch of elegance to your space. Whether you’re diving into a novel, studying, or simply enjoying a magazine, the right floor lamp can make all the difference.

In this guide, we’ll explore the best floor lamps for reading chairs, factors to consider when choosing one, and how to position your lamp for optimal lighting.

# Why a Floor Lamp Is Essential for a Reading Chair

A floor lamp is more than just a lighting fixture; it’s an integral part of a cozy and functional reading space. Here’s why it’s essential:

* **Reduces Eye Strain** — Proper lighting minimizes glare and prevents squinting, making reading easier on your eyes.
* **Enhances Ambience** — The right lamp adds warmth and sophistication to your reading area.
* **Adjustability** — Many floor lamps come with adjustable arms or heads, allowing you to direct the light exactly where needed.
* **Space-Saving Design** — Unlike table lamps, floor lamps don’t take up valuable surface space, making them ideal for compact reading corners.

# Key Features to Look for in a Reading Floor Lamp

Choosing the right floor lamp requires careful consideration of various factors. Here are some key features to keep in mind:

# 1. Brightness & Bulb Type

A reading lamp should provide adequate illumination without being harsh. Look for lamps that accommodate LED bulbs, as they are energy-efficient and offer adjustable brightness levels.

# 2. Adjustability & Flexibility

Lamps with adjustable arms, gooseneck designs, or swing-arm mechanisms allow you to direct light where you need it most. This is especially useful if you share your reading space with others.

# 3. Color Temperature

Color temperature affects how comfortable the light feels on your eyes. For reading, a **warm white light (2700K-3000K)** is ideal as it mimics natural daylight without causing glare.

# 4. Stability & Build Quality

A sturdy base prevents tipping, especially if you have pets or children around. Metal and high-quality plastic designs are both durable and stylish.

# 5. Style & Aesthetic Appeal

Your floor lamp should complement your home decor. Whether you prefer a modern minimalist design, a classic arc lamp, or an industrial-style fixture, choose one that enhances your space.

# How to Position Your Floor Lamp for Optimal Reading

The placement of your [floor lamp](https://pureluxy.com/floor-lamp-for-reading-chair/) can significantly impact your reading comfort. Here’s how to position it correctly:

* **At Shoulder Height**: The bottom of the lampshade should be at eye level when seated to avoid direct glare.
* **Angled Lighting**: Position the light at a 45-degree angle over your shoulder to reduce shadows and maximize illumination.
* **Behind or Beside the Chair**: Placing the lamp slightly behind or beside your [reading chair](https://pureluxy.com/reading-chair-for-bedroom/) helps distribute light evenly.
* **Avoid Direct Overhead Lighting**: Overhead lights can create harsh shadows, leading to eye fatigue.

# Tips for Enhancing Your Reading Nook

Creating a cozy reading space goes beyond lighting. Here are some additional tips to make your nook perfect:

* **Choose a Comfortable Chair** — A cushioned or ergonomic chair provides maximum comfort for long reading sessions.
* **Add a Side Table** — A small table next to your chair can hold books, coffee, or reading glasses.
* **Use Soft Textiles** — Throw pillows and blankets add warmth and coziness to your space.
* **Consider a Bookshelf Nearby** — Keeping books within arm’s reach makes your reading nook functional and stylish.

# Conclusion

A well-chosen **floor lamp for a reading chair** can elevate your reading experience, blending functionality with style. Whether you prefer a minimalist LED lamp, a classic arc design, or a decorative tripod lamp, there’s a perfect option for every space and budget.

When selecting a floor lamp, consider factors like brightness, adjustability, and aesthetics to ensure you get the best reading environment. With the right setup, you’ll create a comfortable, inviting space where you can escape into the world of books anytime.

 “So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fears...fear itself — nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.” - Franklin D. Roosevelt.

The forth world I was sent too was decently the worst so far. There, although  most humans go through their everyday life’s like in a standard world, they also have to deal with the presence of Devils and Curses, roaming the streets for pre, feeding on both human flesh and their cursed energy.

Cursed energy, the source of power that flows through almost every single being on the planet. With this power source humans have done battle throughout the eras, both against themselves and against devils and curses. You see, humans who train with cursed energy are known as sorcerers.

Fear rules as various entities earthly and hellish struggle for control over the world as they use each other for their own means. Society is persevering, although sick to its core as different alien threats rise and fall in a seemingly endless cycle.

+

If a curse absorbed mostly of the fear directed at a certain concept ( Darkness, War, Fire, Gun, Storm, Spider, Bat ) It becomes a Devil. Strength wise, most devil are special grade curses with only the weakest ( Tomato, Coffee, paper) being grade one.

Unlike curses, Devils may survive beyond exorcism by finding a host. Those are called fiends. And generally they are grade 2 or 3.

+

 Jujutsu Sorcery is public knowledge, evengly distrubuted through the globe. The avarege number of sorcerers per civilian in most city is 10 times the one found in cannoon JJK. 
In japan the protection of the public is devided among Public Safety and the private sector. The most powerfull and influential forces in the private sector are the 3 great clans and Jujutsu  high ( that in this world has way more tham 2 to 3 students per class)

Yes, this will post will be a rant about a lot of randumb things I feel like getting off my chest. They’re my opinions, no need to be personally rude should you disagree w/my or any one else’s opinion either. 

So…finally, we are finaalllyy getting somewhere w/the Jamie thang. I just remembered how last episode when Jamie was trying to talk to Trent, Trent mention’s how no one ever knows that Jamie is back yet. !!! How could they keep that a secret, especially coming from Margaret. You’d think she’d tell her daughters & husband that their long lost brother/son is back! I’d wanna kick my mom’s butt if she kept something like that.
But it’s like the more we know about Jamie, comes more enigma about Jamie too. We basically figure out how he basically has Stockholm’s syndrome to whatever woman kept him all these years if he refuses to give her up.

That makes me believe that Jamie has been around the area all these years.  He probably knew his mom was sleeping every night at the bus station (how else would he have known to go there to see his mom. Doesn’t he even admit it took him a few to gain up the courage to approach her?)

^ ^ most recent episode also shows that Peter is magically in Gabi’s basement w/a note ‘Welcome, more to come’ w/Jamie’s cigarettes outside.  If he learned from Sir, I would think he would know how not to leave any traces of him behind…
But how would he have gotten Peter into Gabi’s basement? I don’t think he has key to Gabi’s (then again you never know, he also could have broken in using tools). 
But what was the point of putting Peter in Gabi’s basement, if Gabi did not ‘go home to shower’, they’d of never gotten to Peter in time? And that note…”welcome, more to come” - 
Kind of gave me the weird feeling that Sir could be having some followers kidnap people and without him, then he would have to be the one the ultimately go to, so that they can figure out the case…

MPG says we might not like his character by the end of seaosn 2, so I have a feeling we will be in for either a cliffhanger (they better renew a season 3! Shouldn’t they have already announced it already?!) Maybe MPG means we are not going to like his character bc Heather is going to get him off Scott-free and then he will be free to roam the streets, being able to go to the same coffee shop Lacey and Gabi go to and they can’t do anything about it…

I think I have an old 3DS with a swollen battery. The back of the system is squishy. I panicked and put the whole thing in a coffee can full of cat litter, and then put the coffee can in a Dutch oven. 

Every electronics repair shop around me is closing for the weekend, and the tech who answered my call at one of them said they won’t be available until Monday. Is it safe to wait that long? Do I need to find a different solution? 

I’ve never dealt with this before. I don’t know how much of an emergency this is. But I live in an apartment, so I can’t take it outside and leave it there. I don’t want to put myself and my neighbors in danger by just…letting it sit there? Idk.

Backstory:
Born under a blood moon, Lilith was always a child of whispers and shadow. Her mother — a scholar of forbidden lore — vanished when Lilith was seven. She lives with her older sister (you can be playing th Older sister role too(
Raised among ruins and poetry, Lilith learned to read the stars instead of textbooks. Her power comes from instinct, dreams, and inherited danger. She wasn't good at school and math she thought she hate school but she was just in wrong Field. At 22, she received a full scholarship to the University of Edinburgh. Before that she was a self-taught mythologist and have mythology YouTube channel (30k subs)
she is new at university.
Heartbreak:
Once, she believed in love.
A shapeshifter studied her — became the man of her dreams, earned her trust, seduced her with familiarity… and then vanished. She later learned it was all a manipulation to drain her power.
Now, she claims she’s too dark for love. And she have trust issues 
But sometimes, in the quiet, she still hopes someone will see past the fire… and stay.
Dark Temptation:
She craves minds as sharp as hers. Desires wrapped in danger. Power offered not to control, but to match. She says she doesn’t believe in fate — but some nights, she looks at the stars… and wonders.
**Now about RP:**
1. A male character (29–35) for a dark romance RP

Dynamic ideas: Professor x Student, Stalker x Target, or anything in these types 
He should be older and mysterious, emotionally complex, and can be morally grey
Bonus if he’s secretly obsessed or fascinated by her
Writer must be 22+ IRL

2. A small RP group (or large if y'all like my idea, im thinking about 10 characters now but it's up to y'all)

Set in the real world — but with hidden layers of magic, myth, and mystery
You can play any character you want — no restrictions
I'd especially love to have:
A best friend (any gender or personality) — someone who gets under Lilith's skin and brings out her playful side
You can be any character in this RP 
 Style:
(Give me any idea you have)
Literate / multi-para
Urban Fantasy + Dark Romance
Dark feminine, mythic, and emotionally slow-burn
Themes: obsession, hidden magic, found family, betrayal, ritual, friendships, adventure, darkness vs light 
Writing in Discord or Telegram 
OC-friendly, story-driven, collaborative plotting

I've been eating fairly consistent. 
Breakfast - Avocado with garlic salt and citric acid.
Lunch - home made bolegnase sauce with LF cheese and no pasta.
Dinner - a salad(lettuce,cucumber) with my own balsamic vinegarette(+ oil and salt) and meat(chicken breast, steak, GF sausages, bacon) pan fried. No sauces. 
Snacks. LF cheese stick, LF cheese, peanuts, macadamias, berries(50-100g max) chia tea/coffee with 50ml almond milk and 1 hermesetas mini pill (about 3 a day). And Double D Butter Candy (zero carbs/sugar) to curb night cravings.

I've recorded all food on MyFitnessPal. My macros are showing me in 35-50g of carbs per day. 
Calories intake has been 1500-1700. 

Anyone offer advice, would be appreciated.🙂

I've apparently drop 1.5kg, but I'm not convinced it's fat, just water. Ive been having 2L a day, but feel like I'm peeing more.

On date we have fun, even plan our next date while there, he asks for a kiss to end, I kiss him. Next day texts are less frequent but still fun. Then the Next day after that he says he just wants to be friends because there isn’t a spark and tells me he’s free next Saturday to get coffee.

My question is, can there really only be a spark on the first date? The guy seems to want to meet me again but as a friend. I’m a little sad (even though it’s one date) but I really did like talking to him and would be excited to have a gay friend (all my friends are straight guys lol) and would be excited of the prospects of a new friend with shared interests.

I do think he’s attractive and I think he thinks I’m attractive because he gave me like non stop compliments about my body and face during the date. 

You may be asking “why is this guy confused?” But could he be friend zoning me after only a single date just because he wants to slow things down for now?  Or is this a common thing in the community where gay bros make their friends through non sparked initial dates.

my recipe is for a kalita 155, 15g in, 245g out (around 1:16). i bloom 45g till 40 seconds and pour 100g, wait till the bed is visible and then pour another 100g and wait till bed is visible until i stop the brew. brew time is usually between 3-4 minutes. sometimes i can be quick and be under 3 mins and i take a small sip to check the taste and its been fine most of the time. 

recently, my brews have this weird aftertaste that i initially thought was floral but it’s quite unpleasant moutnfeel so i assuming its astringency? it’s not bitter per se but it slightly tastes like soap? i’m just wondering what i should change to get rid of this flavour

i’ve scoured the internet trying to figure out why and i’ve just had contradicting answers so would appreciate answers with explanations. 

edit: forgot to add - idk for sure the composition of water but it’s being filtered via a brita tap and it doesn’t leave limescale in the kettle so it’s soft enough. i do use a gooseneck kettle do not worry",0,1743205592.0,pourover,1,0.5,False

Growing up I rarely drank water unless I was exercising. I didn’t have any soda or sugary drinks either.

Sugar is definitely the biggest issue here (for me and a lot of us) and I know this because when I cut out sugar last year I was cured for 6 months until I started eating it again consistently. But also during that time I was really taking care of myself and drinking TONS of water.

She arrived at exactly 5 PM. I'd been waiting for five minutes, hands in pockets to hide their trembling.

She wore the same clothes from class, but something was different. Her hair fell loose around her shoulders instead of in its usual tie. I couldn't look away.

""Hi,"" she said, casual as breathing. ""Where are we going?""

Just like that, my worries seemed foolish. We walked to a coffee shop two blocks from campus. Nothing fancy – just a local place with mismatched furniture and ceiling fans that never quite dispelled the heat.

Nervousness clung to me, but I managed to keep the conversation moving. We talked about the awful required science course she was taking, about the novel I stayed up reading, about the strange habits of Professor Meyers who always erased the board in perfect vertical lines.

She laughed when I imitated his precise, robotic movements. The sound was bright and genuine, making others in the café glance our way.

I wanted to ask about that day – why she had been crying alone on a bench – but something held me back. Not on our first real conversation. Not when her eyes were finally bright again.

When we finished our coffee, I summoned another small act of courage.

""Can I get your number?""

She took my phone without a word, added her contact, and handed it back with a smile that stayed with me all night.

After that, something shifted. Group lunches became just the two of us. We claimed a corner table in the dining hall, sharing food and stories. She had a way of listening that made even my most trivial thoughts feel important. I collected her laughs like treasures.

Three weeks passed in this new reality. Each day I learned something new – how she hated cilantro, how she'd wanted to be an astronaut as a kid, how she could recite entire scenes from old movies.

But the question about her tears remained, growing heavier with each day I didn't ask. Finally, I decided it was time.

I prepared myself the night before, rehearsing different ways to bring it up. By morning, my heart was already racing.

We met for lunch as usual. She was telling me about a paper she'd just finished, gesturing with a fork, when I saw my chance.

""Can I ask you something?"" My voice sounded strange, even to myself.

She nodded, still smiling.

""That day when I first spoke to you... why were you crying?""

The words hung in the air between us. Her smile vanished, fork frozen mid-gesture. Silence stretched across our table, drawing taut like a wire.

I regretted the question immediately. This was how it would end – my curiosity destroying whatever we'd built.

She set down her fork carefully, precisely, as if it might break. Her eyes met mine, and I saw something shift behind them – a door opening or closing, I couldn't tell which.

She took a deep breath.

""No one has ever asked me that,"" she said finally. ""No one.""

She leaned forward slightly, her voice dropping so low I had to lean in too.

""I wasn't sure I'd ever tell anyone, but...""",1,1743205311.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Jake wasn’t the type to pick up strays. The Uber app was his lifeline—kept things clean, tracked, safe. But at 11:47 p.m., when he spotted the woman standing alone on the shoulder of Old Quarry Road, cradling a bundled shape against her chest, something tugged at him. The countryside was pitch-black, the kind of dark that swallowed headlights whole, and the air carried a bite that promised frost. No one should be out here this late, he thought—especially not a mother with a kid.
He slowed the sedan, gravel popping under the tires, and leaned out the window. “Hey, you okay? Need a lift?”
She turned, her face hidden beneath a black veil that fluttered faintly despite the still night. The bundle in her arms—a baby, he guessed, maybe four months old—didn’t stir. No cry, no fuss, just silence. “Eight miles down,” she said, her voice low and flat, like it’d been scraped thin. “That’s all.”
Jake hesitated, then popped the back door. “Hop in. It’s too cold to be standing around.” She slid into the seat, the baby nestled against her, and that was that. No app, no fare—just a good deed he’d probably regret when his gas tank ran low.
The car rolled forward, headlights carving a narrow tunnel through the dark. He tried to fill the quiet. “So, uh, where you coming from this late? Family nearby?” Nothing. “Kid’s awfully quiet. Good sleeper, huh?” Silence again, thick and heavy, pressing against the hum of the engine. He glanced in the rearview mirror. The veil obscured her face, but he swore her head tilted slightly, like she was listening to something he couldn’t hear. The baby stayed motionless, a pale little lump wrapped in a gray blanket.
“Eight miles,” she said suddenly, cutting through his next question. “Stop there.”
“Okay, sure,” he muttered, gripping the wheel a little tighter. The road stretched on, flanked by gnarled trees and the occasional glint of a deer’s eyes in the brush. At exactly eight miles—his odometer ticked 47.3—he pulled onto the shoulder beside a sagging farmhouse, its windows dark and lifeless. She stepped out, baby still clutched close, and disappeared into the shadows without a word.
The next morning, bleary-eyed over coffee, Jake noticed it: a scarf draped over the passenger seat. Black, silky, with a faint shimmer—like something homemade but fancy, the kind of thing you’d see in a boutique. Tiny initials, “AW,” were stitched into one corner. He turned it over in his hands, figuring it must’ve slipped off her lap. Decent guy that he was, he decided to swing by the drop-off spot before his first ride. Couldn’t hurt to return it.
The farmhouse looked worse in daylight—peeling paint, a porch sagging like it was tired of standing. He knocked, scarf in hand, and an old woman answered, her face creased with years and weariness. “Morning, ma’am,” Jake started. “I dropped off a lady and her baby here last night. She left this. Thought I’d—” He held up the scarf.
The old woman’s eyes widened, then brimmed with tears. She snatched the scarf, trembling fingers tracing the fabric. “My Anna,” she choked out, voice breaking. “My Anna.”
Jake shifted, uneasy. “Uh, sorry, who’s Anna?”
“Anna Watson,” she whispered, clutching the scarf to her chest. “My daughter. And her little one. They died—car accident, eight miles up that road. Twenty-three years ago.” Her gaze flicked to Jake, sharp and wet. “I lost this scarf after the funeral. Made it for her myself.”
The air in his lungs turned to ice. He stammered something—excuses, apologies—and stumbled back to his car. The odometer still read 47.3. When he checked the backseat later, it was empty—no crumbs, no creases, nothing to prove they’d ever been there. But that night, at 11:47, his app pinged with a new request: Old Quarry Road.

We're 15 years removed from the start of the Eurozone crisis, and Germans still believe it all just began and ended with Germany ""bailing out"" the irresponsible, lazy southern Europeans rather than loan sharking them and crippling them with austerity. 

I'm a Dutch woman currently in Chicago and got invited for coffee by a German last week and I was thinking ""huh, another European here?

We got to talking about economics, and within minutes, he started ranting about how he genuinely does not believe that Germany benefits from the weaker Euro at the expense of southern Europe and Germany's export surplus is all just a product of superior manufacturing and le ""German efficiency"" meme.

It's against the law in Germany to insult somebody, and  people have been charged literally for just [calling a local politician a dick](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/09/09/pimmelgate-german-politician-police-raid/) and Germans are so fucking self-fart sniffing that the majority of them on Reddit discussions have actually shown up to *defend* it. ""Durr, unlike every other country, we realize that verbally degrading people can be just as harmful as physically abusing them. Aren't we just so enlightened??"" 

They self-fellate constantly about how they've ""learned"" from World War II and no one else on Earth can comprehend the horrors of genocide and fascism, when half of them probably can't even tell you a single fucking thing about Germany's colonial history before the Third Reich or the fact that they fucking genocided tens of thousands in Namibia before either of the World Wars.

<div>Transforming your bedroom into a serene retreat can often start with something as simple as book shelf decor. The right bookshelf decor ideas can not only display your favorite reads but also elevate the aesthetic appeal of your space. Here are some creative book shelf decor ideas for your bedroom that will inspire you to curate a personal and inviting atmosphere.

One effective way to enhance your book shelf is by incorporating a mix of decorative objects. Consider using picture frames, candles, or artistic sculptures to break the monotony of stacked books. These elements introduce texture and color, making your shelf visually more appealing. Pair a few coffee table books with a stylish vase filled with fresh flowers to add a touch of life to the arrangement.

Using color coordination is another great strategy. Organizing your books by color can create a stunning gradient effect that becomes a focal point in the room. You can also alternate horizontal and vertical book stacks to add dimension. For a more whimsical touch, consider theming your shelves with a specific palette that matches your bedroom decor.

- **Lighting:** Integrate small LED lights or fairy lights within your bookshelf to create a cozy ambiance.
- **Nature Elements:** Adding small potted plants or succulents brings a refreshing vibe to your space. Choose low-maintenance options to keep upkeep easy.
- **Artistic Touch:** Hang a piece of wall art above the shelf or use framed prints on the sides for a cohesive look.

Lastly, keep your bookshelf functional yet stylish. Use it to store not just books but also journals, craft supplies, or even a small, fabric-lined basket for miscellaneous items. By carefully selecting what goes on your shelves, you can make your bedroom feel organized and inviting while showcasing your personality through book shelf decor.

I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743204379.0,horrorstories,1,1.0,False

1jm8lxb,https://v.redd.it/z4pdtlo3kire1,A Tale of Two Americas: The Other Pays the Bill.,"This likely sounds familiar but I some extent to some of you

You wake up at 6 a.m., exhausted. You didn’t sleep well—maybe your second job ran late, maybe your brain couldn’t stop spinning about the bills, the rent, or whether your car will make it another month. Whatever it was your headache is what reminds you: none of this is sustainable.

You chug coffee. Maybe you skip breakfast. You get ready for a job that barely covers your expenses. If you’re lucky, you have health insurance—but the deductible is $4,000, so you avoid using it.

You drive to work on pothole-riddled roads, past homeless encampments, wondering if that could be you in a year or two. You spend 8–10 hours doing work that’s either numbing or backbreaking. Your boss calls the company a “family,” but you know they’d fire you over a spreadsheet. Lunch? Whatever leftovers or fast food you could scrape together, eaten in 15 minutes if you’re lucky.

Then it’s home or straight to your second job. Or perhaps caring for your kids. Or your parents. Or both. There’s no time to rest. No energy to cook. Groceries are expensive. Gas is expensive. Everything is expensive. And god help you if you get sick, get a flat tire, or need dental work. You check your bank account: two digits, maybe three.

Rent just went up. Again. But your paycheck didn’t. You can’t afford a home, and even if you could, interest rates make it a fantasy. You’re not saving for retirement. You’re just trying to survive until next month.

Maybe you get one weekend off a year. Maybe.
Because if you stop for even a second, everything falls apart.

The headlines say inflation is down. The job market is strong. The economy is booming. But it never trickles down. All you see are billionaires getting richer, politicians pocketing donations, and companies laying off workers to please shareholders.

You’re told to work harder. Learn to code. Skip the lattes. Be grateful.

But here’s the truth:
The system isn’t broken. It’s working exactly as intended.
it’s grinding people like you into dust to keep the machine running. So who funds this system? 3 investment firms.

Most people have never heard of BlackRock, Vanguard, or State Street, but these three financial giants quietly own major stakes in nearly every sector of the economy—tech, housing, energy, weapons, food, and healthcare.

Together, they manage over $25 trillion in assets. If it’s in the S&P 500, odds are they own part of it. Their fingerprints are on everything—from the rent hikes pushing people out of their homes, to the companies behind private prisons and immigrant detention centers, to the fossil fuels warming the planet.

They don’t just invest.
They vote in boardrooms. They influence national economic policy. They profit from mass incarceration and surveillance.
All while hiding behind the facade of your retirement account or pension fund.

They pretend to be invisible. But they shape everything around you.

Here’s how we fight back:

1. Pull the Plug on Their Funding
	
•	Demand cities, states, and universities divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street—especially from fossil fuels and prisons.
	
•	Pressure public pension systems like CALPERS to cut ties.
	
•	Push labor unions to take their members’ money elsewhere.

Every dollar pulled is a vote against exploitation.

2. Expose the Monopoly
	•	These firms own competing corporations across industries, killing competition and inflating prices.
	•	Demand antitrust enforcement and bans on cross-ownership in essential sectors.
	•	Fight for ownership transparency.

They’ve built an empire on secrecy. We tear it down with light.

3. Take Back Our Retirement
	
•	Most people are tied to these firms through retirement accounts—without real consent.
	
•	Demand public or union-run alternatives, with ethical investment options.
	
•	Win back control over our own shareholder votes.

Your savings shouldn’t bankroll oppression.

4. Tax the Empire

•	Support a financial transaction tax to curb reckless speculation.
	
•	Tax unrealized gains on the mega-wealth being hoarded.
	
•	Penalize investments in prisons, ICE contractors, and surveillance tech.

If they profit from misery, they should pay for it.

5. Build Alternatives

•	Fund worker-owned co-ops, public banks, and credit unions.
	
•	Create state- and city-run investment funds to serve communities.
	
•	Launch postal banking and universal financial access.

Starve the beast. Build the future.

6. Boycott. Disrupt. Expose.
	•	Boycott firms backed by BlackRock and Vanguard—start with GEO Group and CoreCivic.

•	Build viral campaigns:
	
•	“Break BlackRock”
	
•	“No Prisons in Our Portfolios”
	
•	“Divest from Death”
	
•	Organize shareholder protests, digital pressure campaigns, and creative disruption.

Name them. Shame them. Strip their power.

7. Use State Power
	
•	Pass laws banning state investments in human rights abusers.
	
•	Require contract transparency for any firm handling public funds.
	
•	Push ballot initiatives to redirect taxpayer money to ethical finance.

Congress may stall. But states can move now.

The Bottom Line:

BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street run on secrecy, complexity, and our money.
If we cut off their public funding, expose their monopoly, and build new systems—we don’t just weaken them.
We build a future that works for people, not profit.

Let’s mobilize. Let’s divest. Let’s disrupt.

She’s so concerned she’s going to be left out but this is my mom’s first grand child so my mom will always come first and won’t be missing out on opportunities just to keep MIL happy.

Every time my partner says look at her bump mom (I have a very neat compact bump) she likes to say what are you on about she has nothing. I actually had my bump measured the other day and all is perfect! 

She caused a huge row with me and my partner the other day because she shouted at him because I won’t put him on the council tax until he moves on and she kept saying to me remember it goes up! Trying to pressurise me into committing fraud basically! She then shouted at my partner over it!

We have booked a 4d scan and only 3 people are allowed to come- I wanted my partner, step dad and mom there, but I have to keep the peace and my partner did say should we ask his mom.

She said she thinks she can be free but I know she won’t appreciate it as much as my family will and with all the trouble she’s caused I don’t want her to come! I know it will cause a big argument but I don’t really know what to say/do I even changed the date hoping she can’t make it! 

I don’t really want her to come the main reason I booked it was really for my step dad as he’s the most excited person for the baby to come and my mom also attended a scan with me where we received bad news so I would like for her to see a positive scan.

The scan I had where we received bad news my MIL didn’t even ask how I was or her son, she was having happy family photos with his sister as they went for coffee.

As I went round to explain the situation she sat there painting her nails and kept saying oh turns out she was absolutely fuming my mom came to the scan and said she could have attended too.

A couple years ago I became aware I had an addiction to Excedrin. If someone isn't aware it's a pill for migraines, which i take because i have chronic ones that are genetic.This became a huge issue and of course it caused me to suffer from great anxiety and whatnot.. it got to a point where I started to suffer physically and was sick every day. My partner then had a long talk with me and after that, I gradually quit in the process of a month.

A year ago I went on some prescription medication. These don't clash particularly well with caffeine, but I'm not a huge coffee guy. I then found out that with my dosage, it wouldn't do much. Still had no urges because I hadn't had migraines in a long time.

Recently though, I don't know what happened. A relapse of some sort?? I'm not very familiar with the idea. I've been taking it every day now and it's just 1, cause the migraines keep coming back and I need to do digital art to keep up for money and social media. I know that I should cut down on the screen time and that it'd make the migraines worse, but I really need the money for physical medical issues as I'm in the US and... that shit is expensive.

Do any of you know of any other methods that would help me make my migraines go away without needing excedrin?... non addictive things? I've tried to take tylenol and advil but I don't know. They don't work the same. I'm scared that I'm gonna go from 1 pill to 4 again. I don't know if I'm asking the right questions. But any help appreciated and any questions are welcome...


Edit: I'd like to add that this is genuinely so debilitating. I can't even begin to describe how physically I'll these make me. it's horrific. ",2,1743203803.0,AddictionAdvice,2,1.0,False
1jm8jol,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1jm8jol/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743203763.0,FictionWriting,1,1.0,False

I usually last a week before deleting it for months. I'm interested in dating but also very content alone and am not finding quality on there.  I've been single for 4 years now.

I booted up Tinder 2 weeks ago, swiped the usual faces and was just about to delete it again until I saw him. My first 'serious' boyfriend, from when I was 19. We matched! We were only together a year. We lived together, we were young, and he broke up with me because he didn't feel 'giddy' lol. I was *devestated* and never quite got over him because I was never treated with the same respect he gave me by anyone else. He set the bar pretty high and no one compared. He was just a nice guy and I adored him but I did get over it and he was a fleeting thought over the years.

We briefly talked and met once 3 years ago when he visited and it wasn't awkward. Now he's back living here and we are going for coffee tomorrow. Its not a date. But i'm nervous. We both look so different now, our personalities still seem the same but I know they can't be after 20 years. I know why we weren't compatible then, and unless some things changed, we probably won't be now. 

I'm trying not to have hope or disappointment but i'm already getting the ""its fate/people change"" stuff from friends and family. They all liked him.  Has anyone reconnected after this long and how did it go? Should I treat this as a first 'date' and try to remember I don't know him already or do I go in as 'aquaintences'?

Tldr: My best friend of 10 years cut me off for no discernable reason. The other, she ended our friendship today after being silent for six months. She said we should have coffee, and I spent 6 months chasing up on a friend that decided my chasing was too overwhelming for her to stay. Now I don't know what to do, and I need advice.



I don't quite know how to start this, but I figured I'd start it here. I'm a 21 year old masters student in the UK, and I'm currently struggling with friends. 

Part of it stems from the fact that when I was young, I was taught that you only go outside when you needed something from the outside world. This severely limited me from performing as a friend in a meaningful capacity


But I recently have been challenging my childhood traumas and lessons from that, and that meant being a more present friend. I struggle with ADHD, so this was already a challenge from the onset. I also know I'm also an ""anxiously attached person"" (I don't know what that means fully, hence the quotes), and that I struggle with abandonment issues. I decided to try to be as best a friend as I could be. I don't have a place in my current friend groups, I'm a floater friend at times. Nobody really calls or texts me. Then the really rough time came.

I have been chasing up two friends, both of whom I know aren't around anymore. One cut me off without saying anything. Our final conversation was a very good one, I told them how proud I was of their achievements. Then they were gone.

The second one and I were also very good friends. We got along great and we did a lot together. She told me in September that we should get coffee. I said fine, and the last time she willingly texted me was when she was drunk on a night out, telling me how much she loved and cared about me. But that was the last text she ever sent me. I kept following up, calls and texts. At first every other day, just a text. Then I'd wait and text or call once every week, then a month. I didn't call or text all the time. 

Once I started to struggle with friendship issues, and my mental state would dip, I'd call just to talk to her. She didn't know but I did that with a lot of my friends, and still do, either text or call just to talk to someone because I don't feel comfortable being alone. I told her over text about the issues, figuring she'd read but not reply.

 I explained that it bothered me, the isolation, and that i was mad at her, but that I didn't wanna continue on withholding my emotions because I care about her. I explained that I wanted a resolution and maybe we could work toward something better. This was in March, 6 months after her last text. 

I realized that maybe I should have been open, but in the moment, I was struggling and didn't see past what was in my head. 


Then she told me this today. 

""Hey, I'm sure you've seen that I haven't replied. It's not that your a bad person, and you haven't done anything wrong. I just don't think I have the capacity to nurture this relationship right now

I'm sorry that my lack of responsiveness caused you stress. I hope you can understand, I'm wishing you all the best, and thank you for being a kind and friendly face. See you around at some point""

I don't know how to process this. I know I call and text frequently, but not all time time. As of late I've been struggling and kind of hoping she would be there, but I knew she wouldn't be. Now I'm grieving. I'm mad at her and my other ex friend for various things. For her, I'm mad at her inability to communicate. For putting so much effort in and trying to be there for her, meanwhile she wouldn't tell me how she felt or what she felt. For me, that would have been enough to make the adequate changes. She never texted me at all, not even holidays or my birthday. I told her this in response.

Hey -insert name here- thanks for telling me this. 
 I appreciate you telling me this. The reassurance is appreciated. It wasn't my intention to overwhelm you, but in reflection, I know it definitely would. 

I wasn't looking just for reaffirmation though. I wanted to be a more active friend in my friend groups, and to invest in my relationships in a way which I felt would be mutually invested. I was afraid of losing you, and (mutual friend) and others, by not being present. 

I'm sorry for not giving you the space you needed, and for instead causing you overwhelm by pushing forward. 

Thanks for your message once again. I hope you understand my side. Thank you, and goodbye.


To the other friend, I'm mad about their breeching my trust. They knew me for s decade in person, we went to school together. The worst thing they could possibly do to me is disappear from my life for good. Then they did it, and I couldn't comprehend why. I didn't even get the chance to say goodbye. 


Now I'm here. I know I'm on the verge of losing a third friend because I keep trying to contact them. My current friend groups, I don't feel like I have a place in. I don't even know if this is a real issue anymore or if I'm manufacturing this. I don't know how people work, and I've made this group of friends carefully as it is. I can't lose anymore because I can not gain anymore.

At this point, I don't know what to do, and that's where I'm looking for advice. How do you grieve the loss of friends in a way which is healthy? How did you challenge abandonment issues? How do you find more friends outside of university as an adult? What could I have done to improve this situation that I'm not seeing? ",2,1743203524.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

This weekend, we have NAC Breda taking on Groningen in a match that promises to be as thrilling as watching paint dry—unless, of course, you're a fan of either team, in which case, it's the event of the century.

NAC Breda, priced at 2.4 by Bovada, is the slight favorite here. But let's not forget that underdogs in soccer win about 41% of the time, which means Groningen, with odds of 3.0, has a decent shot at pulling off an upset. And if you're feeling particularly adventurous, a draw at 3.1 could be the way to go, because who doesn't love a good stalemate?

Now, let's talk about the best bet. Considering the odds and the fact that both teams are about as consistent as a weather forecast, the Over 2.25 goals at 1.87 seems like a solid choice. After all, both teams have been known to leak goals like a sieve, and there's nothing like a goal-fest to keep the fans entertained.

So, grab your clogs, pour yourself a nice cup of Dutch coffee, and get ready for a match that will either be a thrilling display of football prowess or a 90-minute exercise in patience. Either way, it's bound to be memorable—or at least, it'll give you something to talk about at the water cooler on Monday.

I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743203483.0,DarkTales,1,1.0,False

This is a long story but I want to make it short.

I met this guy last year in April in the library and we opened up a lot, very fast. He eventually introduced me to a lot of his friends and family and we talked more (started going to his church). He's one of those very argumentative guys who has strong beliefs and rarely negotiates (loves to debate types and laugh at you for not agreeing with him). I didn't see this side of him until things settled down.

I gave him a lot of advice regarding girls and career stuff etc. I came to him for advice like once regarding a job interview I had even though he doesn't have experience with interviews (he works at a movie theatre and I work in a high rise office. im not putting him down when I say this for your information but he hints at wishing he could do my type of job). The other day, the topic of politics came up and he mentioned how he is a republican and asked what I support and I said democrat. He said he guessed its probably because my father was a democrat and I said yes, partially but not entirely because of my father. He laughed and said how much (in terms of influence) ? I said I wouldn't quantify it and then he said ok ""I'm gonna assume a lot"" and started to tell me about how everything ive agreed with is basically what republicans support. it sounded like he was trying to convince me, subtly - even started telling me to go read more on DJT and what he stands for and to not listen to media's that destroy his reputation.

The next day, over text, I addressed the part where he assumed im solely a democrat because of my father and said ""Hey Charles, I didn’t appreciate how you tried boxing me in yesterday when you said you believe the reason I’m liberal is solely due to my father after I told you I didn’t want to go into politics. An apology will suffice"". This sparked conflict and asked me to meet him in person which I did. But he sent this before we met that evening when we went back and forth :

""Ok. See you next time. Consider this friendship over. But I’m looking forward to taking about what you didn’t like about what I said and, if warranted, an apology will be made. Things will be cordial and amicable moving forward, but this friendship is over my dear bro. You are my brother in Christ, but a friendship is out of the question. I’ll hit u up for next time. I’m looking forward to it.""

I ended up going to meet. I bought us both coffee at Starbucks and sat on a couch with him. In person, he insulted my character, raised his voice and said I only asked him to apologize because I have low self esteem and low confidence and how I want to bring him down to my level by forcing an apology and submit, how he doesn't trust me, how I love to argue, how controlling I am etc. I told him he's wrong about me and im not doing that and even mentioned the things ive done for him that were in his best interest like uplift him (not to come off as bragging but to dismantle his argument and show him my perspective).

After he left. I sent him this :

I don’t feel bad about myself Charles nor do I have low self esteem. I'm ok the way I am, Charles even much better than others

This apology thing bothered you that much, to the point where you began insulting me and throwing all kinds of bad words in my direction. 

People do things in their life, sometimes bad sometimes good, even you joke about it when it happens. 

But you took it seriously today (even the texting) and threw unnecessary bad words against my character. Non stop.

I’m not interested in ever being friends after this. I don’t deserve this type of treatment and disrespect. Ciao for now"".

Its been almost 9 weeks of no contact and i've stopped going to that specific church (I get texts from people at church saying they miss me and asking if everything is alright but I just say ive been busy with work and school stuff to avoid drama). When he sees me in passing he just nods my head or actually gives me a pound with his fist and says ""hey what's up Adam"".

I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743203168.0,Creepystory,1,1.0,False

Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743202932.0,Creepystories,1,1.0,False

Extra notes:

1) I find it strange that they put so much emphasis on the Metatron’s offered coffee, but I don’t think the Coffee Theory is necessarily true. The Metatron wouldn’t need to drug Aziraphale’s coffee to get him to come back. Aziraphale (along with Muriel and probably most other low ranking angels) are basically the embodiment of religious trauma. Heaven drills into their heads that they are the good guys and they need to follow orders or else they are the bad guys. Aziraphale willingly deceives himself into believing that Heaven and the angels are perfect and can do no wrong. He believes that he can help Heaven by taking charge. The Metatron didn’t need to drug him because he has lied to himself for so long that they are the good guys.

1.5) I say it isn’t *necessarily* true because the writers could always use it as the easy way out. I also believe that the Metatron could have somehow threatened Aziraphale using the coffee or said something to him that wasn’t shown on screen. 

2) The way Aziraphale and Crowley look at each other!!!! Oh my lord, get married already. Crowley was fighting the urge to get on one knee and propose during the book shop scene istg. 

3) I have an indescribable itch to consume every good omens fanfiction ever posted on AO3 and then write more. 

3.5) Particularly soulmate AUs. And universes where Aziraphale didn’t leave for heaven. Potentially universes where Crowley storms heaven and steals Aziraphale back. 

4) GABRIEL AND BEELZEBUB? That was unexpected(ly cute). A little bit cheap but also great. 

5) What gender is Beelzebub?? I know that demons and angels don’t really have genders and just present themselves as one, but I mean the actor(s because I’m pretty sure there’s different ones in season one and two). They are giving my nonbinary friend some serious gender envy. 

6) David Tennant is freakishly good at playing LGBTQ+ characters. 

6.5) HEAR ME OUT, CROWLEY WHEN HE’S PRETENDING TO BE WARLOCK’S NANNY. 

7) I love Aziraphale, but the second hand embarrassment I get watching him try to do any form of public speaking is unbearable. He’s like a million years old and he’s still socially awkward (I don’t blame him; I’m the same. Just not a million). At least he’s trying. 

8) THE DANCE SCENE. RAAAAAA. I’M FOAMING AT THE MOUTH THINKING OF IT. 

9) Everyone needs a Jim (which is short for James, which is short for Gabriel) in their life. ",28,1743202891.0,goodomens,10,1.0,False

1jm86gh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepypastastories/comments/1jm86gh/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743202752.0,Creepypastastories,1,1.0,False
1jm86b5,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jm86b5/hr_wrong_morning/,[HR] wrong morning,"The first thing that struck Evan as odd was the silence.
No birdsong, no hum of traffic, no wind tapping against the windowpane. Just a suffocating quiet that pressed down on him the moment he opened his eyes.
The morning light bleeding through the blinds was pale and cold. Not golden, not warm—just… sterile. Like the artificial glow of a hospital room. He blinked a few times, letting his eyes adjust, and sat up in bed. His sheets felt off—rougher than usual, stiff. The room smelled like bleach and something else, something faintly metallic.
Maybe Lila had done the laundry wrong. Again.
“Lila?” he called out groggily.
No response.
He stood, stretching, and shuffled toward the bedroom door, stepping over the cat bed where Felix usually curled up. Except… it was empty. Strange. Felix was always waiting by the bedroom door, meowing for food the second Evan got up.
Maybe Lila had already fed him. Or maybe he was hiding.
The hallway looked the same—family photos on the wall, hardwood floors, the chipped paint near the bathroom door where the movers had bumped it last year. But still, that feeling clung to him, crawling up his spine like cold fingers.
Something wasn’t right.
The kitchen was clean. Too clean. Every surface gleamed like it had just been scrubbed. The coffee pot was empty, no dishes in the sink, no crumbs on the counter. Evan frowned. Lila was many things, but tidy wasn’t one of them.
He checked his phone. No notifications. No texts from Lila. No news updates. No time.
The phone said 12:00 AM. Not blinking. Just... frozen.
He tried restarting it, but it wouldn't respond. Just the home screen, lit up with that same eerie, pale glow that didn’t match the light outside.
He turned on the TV. Nothing.
No static. No error screen.
Just black.
He stood there for a moment, the silence pressing harder now, pulsing in his ears like something alive. His own breath seemed too loud.
The air felt heavy.
Thick.
Wrong.
He opened the front door.
The world outside was still.
Not empty—just... paused. Like someone had hit a cosmic “pause” button and walked away. The neighbor’s car sat in the driveway across the street, but there were no birds in the trees, no wind, no rustle of leaves. The sky was gray and low, the kind of gray that made you think of ash.
And then he noticed something that made his stomach turn.
Every house on the street had its front door wide open.
Every single one.
Not ajar. Not cracked.
Flung open.
Like the occupants had all left in a hurry—or never planned to return.
“Lila?” he called again, louder this time, stepping back inside. “Where the hell are you?”
Still nothing.
He grabbed his keys and bolted out the door. He would go to his neighbor Mark’s house. Mark was the paranoid type—security cameras, guns, prepper packs. If something was happening, he’d know.
The walk felt longer than it should have. The silence grew deeper with each step, so deep it roared in his ears like pressure underwater. His footsteps echoed unnaturally.
He reached Mark’s porch, pushed the already open door, and stepped inside.
The air smelled wrong.
Rotting meat and something chemical.
“Mark?” he called, voice shaking.
No answer.
The living room was empty. Tidy, like someone had cleaned it right before company. But there was something off about the photos on the walls. He stepped closer.
The faces were missing.
Not scratched out—gone.
As if someone had peeled them away. Where Mark and his wife and their kids should’ve been, there were just blank ovals. Smooth, pale voids.
Evan’s breath hitched.
He stumbled backward, knocking over a lamp, the crash shattering the silence—and immediately regretted it.
Because in the hallway ahead, something moved.
Slow. Deliberate.
Not walking. Dragging.
He turned and ran, sprinting back to his house, slamming the door shut behind him and locking it. As if a lock could protect him from… whatever that was.
He leaned against the door, panting, and that’s when he noticed the sound.
Not silence anymore.
Whispers.
Faint. Impossible to understand. Like dozens of voices murmuring just out of reach. They seemed to come from everywhere—the walls, the floor, the very air around him.
And then, he saw the cat.
Felix.
Sitting in the middle of the living room, staring at him.
But his eyes were wrong.
Too wide.
Too human.
And when the cat opened its mouth, it didn’t meow.
It spoke.
“You’re not supposed to be here, Evan.”
He froze.
“What… what did you say?”
Felix tilted his head, like it was just learning how to use its own neck. “This version wasn’t meant to wake.”
Evan backed away. “No. No. This is a dream. I’m dreaming. I must be.”
“Would that make you feel better?” the cat asked, standing now, its legs bending at too many angles. “To pretend?”
Evan turned and bolted for the bedroom. He’d hide. He’d figure this out. He slammed the door shut and shoved the dresser in front of it, heart racing.
Then, the whispers stopped.
And he heard something worse.
Breathing.
Right behind him.
He turned.
There was a mirror on the wall.
But the reflection in it wasn’t his.
It was him—yes—but the eyes were missing. Just smooth, empty sockets. And it was smiling.
“You’re waking up,” the reflection said.
“No,” Evan whispered. “I am awake. I’m awake now.”
The thing in the mirror leaned closer.
“No. We’re awake.”
The bedroom door burst open—not from force, but from simply ceasing to exist. It evaporated, the dresser crashing down into an empty frame.
The hallway beyond was gone.
In its place was a long, endless corridor made of pulsing black walls, wet and breathing. Like being inside a living thing.
And from the corridor, they came.
Figures. All shaped like people—but not people.
Too tall. Too thin. Faces covered in gauze, stitched smiles stretching across blank features. They moved with a jerky, stuttering motion, like a broken film reel.
Evan screamed.
He turned to run—anywhere, anywhere but toward them—but his legs weren’t working right. He stumbled, fell, crawled into the bathroom, slamming the door shut behind him.
The whispers were louder now.
Right behind the door.
Right inside his head.
They said his name over and over. And in between the name, they asked questions.
“Do you remember what you did?”
“Do you remember why you’re here?”
“No,” he whispered. “I didn’t do anything.”
But something inside him cracked. A sliver of memory.
Blood. Lila’s scream.
A car. A crash.
Felix, yowling in terror in the backseat.
The impact.
The silence.
“You weren’t supposed to survive.”
The voice came from the bathtub now.
He turned slowly.
Lila was there.
At least, part of her.
Her head lolled to the side, her neck bent at an impossible angle, bones jutting through pale skin.
She smiled at him.
“Hi, honey,” she gurgled.
Evan backed into the wall, tears streaming down his face.
“This isn’t real. This can’t be real.”
Lila tilted her head further—bones cracking. “It is now.”
The bathroom lights began to flicker, casting strobing shadows across the walls. The whispers turned to screaming. The gauze-faced figures filled the hallway, pressing against the door, against the walls, their fingers slipping under the cracks, stretching and squirming.
The mirror shattered.
And the pieces began to move on their own.
Tiny reflections of Evan screamed silently from each shard.
Lila began to climb out of the tub. Her limbs cracked as she moved. “You shouldn’t have woken up, Evan,” she said, her voice layered with others—dozens of them. Men, women, children.
“You’re in our place now.”
Evan ran.
Through the wall.
It didn’t matter anymore. Reality had no rules here. He burst through drywall and into another room—but it wasn’t his home anymore.
It was a hospital.
Dim. Flickering. The smell of antiseptic and decay thick in the air.
And there, in a bed surrounded by wires and machines, lay himself.
Unmoving.
Pale.
Hooked up to life support.
Monitors flatlined.
And above it, watching silently, were the gauze-faced figures.
One by one, they turned to look at him.
“Now do you remember?” they said in unison.
He collapsed to his knees.
“I died,” he whispered.
“Yes,” they said. “But not all the way.”
“You brought yourself back. You clawed your way out. But you came back wrong.”
The lights buzzed.
The machines screamed.
And the figures closed in.
Lila stood behind them, her eyes black and endless. “You don’t belong in the world anymore, Evan. You belong to us.”
He tried to run again—but his legs sank into the floor like tar.
The gauze-faces grabbed him, pulling him downward. Into the floor. Into the dark. Into whatever waited beneath.
He screamed until his voice broke.
And then—

He woke up.
Gasping. Drenched in sweat.
Morning sunlight poured through the window.
Real sunlight. Warm. Golden.
The sound of birds outside.
He sat up, shaking.
Felix meowed from the foot of the bed.
“Lila?” he croaked.
She poked her head in from the hallway, toothbrush in her mouth. “Yeah, babe?”
He stared.
Her neck was fine. Her face normal.
No gauze. No whispers.
Just… Lila.
His heart pounded.
Maybe it was just a nightmare.
Just a dream.
Just…
But as he reached to rub his face, he noticed something in the mirror beside the bed.
A crack.
Just a hairline fracture.
Running across the glass.
From his reflection’s eye—
Down to its smile.

The Benefits of Smoothies Over Coffee: Why You Should Consider Making the Switch
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many people rely on coffee to kick-start their day, but have you considered the benefits of switching to smoothies? Smoothies can provide an energizing alternative to caffeine that not only fuels your body but also supports overall health. Here’s why you might want to consider making the switch.

### Natural Energy Boost

One of the primary benefits of smoothies over coffee is that they provide a natural energy boost. Smoothies made with fruits and vegetables are packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that can enhance your vitality without the jitters and crashes associated with caffeine. For instance, a banana or spinach smoothie delivers potassium and magnesium, which helps maintain energy levels throughout the day, providing sustained energy rather than a quick fix.

### Hydration Matters

Staying hydrated is crucial for maintaining energy. Coffee has a diuretic effect, which can lead to dehydration. On the other hand, smoothies often contain water or hydrating fruits like watermelon or cucumber. This combination helps keep you refreshed and energized. Adding a base like coconut water or almond milk can also boost your hydration while providing essential nutrients.

### Rich in Nutrients

Unlike coffee, which offers minimal nutritional value, smoothies can be nutrient powerhouses. By blending various fruits, vegetables, and superfoods like chia seeds or flaxseeds, you get a wide array of vitamins and minerals. For example:

​ Discover the delicious smoothie plan that lets you eat normally while you shed the weight! -Click Here to Learn More--&gt; https://freepage.pro/loganferret/smoothiediet   
- **Fruits:** Packed with vitamin C and antioxidants.
- **Leafy Greens:** Rich in iron and fiber.
- **Nuts and Seeds:** Provide healthy fats and proteins.

This nutrient-rich combination can enhance your overall well-being and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.

### Improved Digestion

Another benefit of smoothies is their positive impact on digestion. Many ingredients in smoothies, such as yogurt or leafy greens, are high in fiber and probiotics, which help promote gut health. Good digestion means more energy, as your body can better absorb the essential nutrients it needs from your food. Unlike coffee, which can upset your stomach, smoothies are easy on the digestive system.

### Curbing Cravings

Many people find that switching to smoothies helps to curb cravings for sugary snacks or processed foods. Smoothies can be customized to include satisfying ingredients such as nut butter or oats, which keep you fuller for longer. This can help you maintain better control over your eating habits throughout the day, leading to healthier choices overall.

### Easy to Customize

One of the greatest advantages of smoothies is their versatility. You can tailor your smoothie to meet your specific taste preferences and dietary needs. Whether you love tropical flavors or a rich chocolate taste, there’s a smoothie out there for everyone. Here are a few ideas:

- **Tropical Green Smoothie:** Spinach, pineapple, banana, and coconut water.
- **Chocolate Almond Delight:** Cocoa powder, almond butter, banana, and almond milk.
- **Berry Blast:** Mixed berries, yogurt, and a splash of orange juice.

The possibilities are endless!

### Boosting Mood

Choosing smoothies over coffee can also have a positive effect on your mood. Many of the ingredients in smoothies, such as bananas and berries, promote the production of serotonin, also known as the “feel-good” hormone. This natural mood boost can help you start your day on a positive note and keep stress at bay.

### Cost-Effective Choices

Making smoothies can be more cost-effective compared to a daily coffee habit. While crafting a delicious smoothie at home may require an initial investment in a blender, the ongoing costs for ingredients like fruits, veggies, and oats are often much lower than buying coffee daily at your favorite café. Plus, you can make your smoothies in bulk, saving time and money.

Smoothies into your daily routine can provide a range of benefits compared to relying on coffee. From natural energy to improved digestion and nutrient density, smoothies can be a delicious and healthy alternative to kickstart your day. Why not give them a try?

### Conclusion

Transitioning from coffee to energizing smoothies can be a refreshing journey toward healthier energy alternatives. By opting for smoothies, you open the door to a world of vibrant flavors while nourishing your body with essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Each smoothie recipe offers a unique blend of ingredients designed to uplift your spirits and sustain your energy throughout the day without the jitters or crashes associated with caffeine.

I asked if they needed to borrow my father's truck earlier this week, which they responded: ""we might"" but they are barely following up with me today about needing it tomorrow....and I agreed to go on a coffee date with another friend..

I am a little annoyed about the situation. There is no conversation about whether they will need my help with moving, or if they need me to accompany them to where they are moving to. I don't even know what time they are going to come pick up the car, so I feel like I am just supposed to wait around for them until they pick up the car.

I've been friends with this person for a long time, and they have always deemed me the ""planner"" in this friendship, while they basically sit back and i figure the logistics out. 

I know my friend and their partner moving is obviously not my responsibility whatsoever, but dude at least give me some idea what's going on, so I can go about doing what I want to do over the weekend.

Maybe it's my problem assuming they will need my help, but the whole thing makes me anxious.

1jm82kh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepyPastas/comments/1jm82kh/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743202450.0,CreepyPastas,1,1.0,False

Detective Elias Vance had seen his fair share of bizarre cases, but none quite like this. The body of seventeen-year-old Darren Holloway was found in the middle of his school courtyard, burned beyond recognition. There were no traces of accelerants, no signs of external ignition—just the eerie, undeniable fact that he had gone up in flames with no apparent cause.

The primary suspect? A fellow student, sixteen-year-old Evelyn Carter, a girl with a troubled past and an uncanny reputation for unsettling those around her. Witnesses claimed that Evelyn and Darren had been arguing moments before the incident, and then, as if by an unseen force, he erupted into fire.

Elias wasn’t one to buy into superstition, but when the accusations turned to theories of psychic abilities and witchcraft, he knew he needed someone with a different perspective. Enter Dr. Lillian Graves, a forensic psychiatrist specializing in cases where psychology and the inexplicable intersected.

“You believe she did this?” Elias asked as he slid the case file across Lillian’s desk.

The doctor skimmed the reports, her fingers drumming against the pages. “I believe perception and reality don’t always align. If people think Evelyn has powers, that belief alone can shape their testimonies.”

The two visited Evelyn at the juvenile detention center. The girl sat with her hands wrapped around a cup of water, her fingers trembling.

“I didn’t do it,” she whispered. “I was just… angry. But I swear, I never touched him.”

Elias and Lillian exchanged a glance. If she wasn’t lying, then something else had ignited Darren Holloway.

Their investigation led them down an unexpected path—researching rare cases of Spontaneous Human Combustion (SHC). While most dismissed it as urban legend, Elias found documented incidents eerily similar to Darren’s demise. The victims all shared peculiar traits: high stress levels, chronic anxiety, and, in some cases, neurological conditions that could affect metabolic heat production.

A breakthrough came when Lillian uncovered medical records indicating Darren suffered from an undiagnosed mitochondrial disorder—one that could, under the right circumstances, lead to excessive heat generation.

Further digging revealed that Darren had been experimenting with a dangerous mix of performance enhancers and unregulated supplements to keep up with his rigorous sports schedule. Combined with his disorder, they theorized, his body had become a ticking time bomb.

Armed with their findings, Elias and Lillian presented their case. The prosecution balked at first, but the medical evidence was undeniable. Evelyn Carter was released, and Darren’s tragic death was ruled a medical anomaly rather than murder.

As the dust settled, Elias and Lillian reflected on the case over coffee.

“You think we’ll ever see another one like this?” Elias mused.

Lillian smirked. “If we do, I hope it doesn’t prove us wrong.”
