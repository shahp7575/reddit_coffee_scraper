# Capítulo 1: The Devil’s Secretary

***\[Music: The Devil You Know By X Ambassadors\]***

*The Kings’.*

Every single person in Midnight City knew that name. It wasn’t just a name, but a brand… the epitome of the city’s very foundation.

I was the secretary to Ares King, CEO of King Corp. Yes, *the King.* The impenetrable billionaire bachelor with looks that could make you drop your panties and scream fuck me! *But personality?* Not so much, he’s a walking hump of ice who has one thing in mind. *Business.*

*2*

Those poor, unfortunate souls who thought they could have a chance with him are better off in the Bermuda Triangle.

As his secretary, I had to be flawless to the last detail, had to be three steps ahead, had to swallow up whatever emotional shit I’m going through, and act like my life is made of no worries.

When you work for Ares King, you’re not a person, just a tool to get things done, and questions are not asked.

But it’s time to close that chapter.

“Okay.” I pushed my glasses to the bridge of my nose. “Just press the damn button, Catherine. Don’t hold out on me now.”

I thought this was gonna be easy. I was expecting a swift decision, not hanging for the last hour.

I chewed on my nails as anxiety got the better of me. Realizing my habit, I forced my hand to my lap.

“Deep breaths, you can do this. You can—”

“Ms. Lane,” a deep, gruff voice came through the earpiece I wore.

I flinched, clicking print on impulse. *Great! Who knew that was the push I needed?*

“Y-Yes, Mr King?” I replied shakily, my heart in my throat.

“Coffee.”

The intercom went off, and I closed my eyes. After all this time, Catherine, you still haven’t gotten used to that voice.

I sighed when the printer made a soft humming noise. “One last coffee run for my devil boss.”

When I get back, I’m bringing my resignation letter to his office, and then this chapter is closed, *locked* with the key thrown into the abyss.

*1*

I pushed to my feet, my stilettos making a sharp click-clack. I opened the door and stepped into the bullpen, where rows of desks stretched out in a bland display, phones ringing and keyboards clacking with haste.

There wasn’t a single thing out of place, the perfect air for a billion-dollar company with overqualified people.

Unlike me, who had to work my ass from the gutter up, most of them here had privileges I didn’t.

I just happened to land this position because I passed the one-month trial period, aka *the curse month.* No one had lasted that long, hence the eerie label.

Either they get their heart broken when their romantic endeavors toward the CEO don’t work, or they get mentally stressed to the point they drop out faster than a bowling ball, battling the next year in therapy.

Ares King wasn’t called the devil CEO for nothing. You know that feeling when you’re constantly at the edge of the cliff? Well, that’s working for him, and it doesn’t sum it all up.

I had so much on my plate, and against all odds, I dealt with all the shit thrown at me. I worked for the devil for three fucking years. Therefore, I was given a nickname.

“Here she comes.”

“The devil’s secretary.”

*1*

“I don’t know if I should be amazed or disturbed.”

“Color me disturbed.”

“Working closely with Mr. King must be a major trauma load.”

“How does she do it?”

“You don’t think she’s—”

“Nahhh, doubt that. He certainly wouldn’t settle for someone like her.”

“True, he can date models, not a wash-up version.”

*Ouch.*

“She probably thinks she’s some kinda big shot pulling this off.”

“Maybe she just stayed, hoping for a chance with Ares King.”

“Don’t they all?”

“Not all can take that load. She’s definitely desperate.”

“Stooping so low for a chance, unbelieveable.”

“Shhh! She’s close!”

*Every. Single. Time.* I thought I’d get used to their gossip by now, but they always found a way to make it greatly *impactful.*

Nevertheless, I kept my posture, walking professionally as if their words never bothered me.

\~☆\~

I set the coffee on the table to grab the paper from the printer when the doors leading to my boss’s office open with force. A man stepped out, fury twisted on his face.

He snappily loosens his tie. “Fuck him! Fuck this company! Fuck you too!”

I frowned at him. “Sir, I’m gonna ask you to leave before I call security.”

“My entire project is in the mud, all because of one mistake!”

I was already dialing a number, and I made sure he could see me doing it. I’m accustomed to this display, and they sometimes get violent.

In a single day, dreams are crushed and careers are ruined. Not everyone can take that calmly.

“Your boss is evil!” He came towards me, and I took cautious steps back.

I’m still traumatized by when someone tossed a stapler at me and destroyed my desk.

Footsteps echoed, grasping our attention. Ares King emerged, spotless in his three-piece suit. Hair as dark as midnight and cold blue eyes that could freeze you over with one look.

“Is there a problem, Mr. Hayes?” he asked calmly.

I shivered at the lifeless tone.

“Y-You didn’t give me a chance. This is my life’s work. You can’t do this to me!”

“Chance is equivalent to a risk. I’m not risking millions of dollars on a failed project.”

*1*

“Failed project? It hasn’t even—”

“This discussion ended when I gave my final verdict.”

“You can’t just—”

“Do yourself a favor and leave before you lose something else other than your career.”

The threat hung in the air, and Mr. Hayes couldn’t tell if he was serious or making a light-hearted threat.

*1*

The security team was already here, and I sighed in relief. They dragged him out as he cried and appealed for a chance before following it up by cursing the King’s name.

That was the fifth one today, and the day wasn’t even over yet.

*2*

“Ms. Lane. I have a meeting in an hour. Is everything ready?”

*Crap!* I haven’t prepared for that. I was hoping to bring my letter early. *It’s not too late.*

I approached him, stretching my hand for him to take the coffee. “Um, Mr. King, I—”

He pinned me with those cold blue eyes, and I rephrased my words.

“E-Everything will be ready in a few minutes.” I fixed my usual fake smile.

He was back in his office, leaving me hanging. I checked my watch and saw his coffee order had exceeded fifteen minutes.

*Such a waste.*

I subconsciously drank from the cup and grimaced, sticking out my tongue.

That was not a wise move, given that he took his coffee black with no sugar.

“Yuck!”

\~☆\~

I ended up leaving the letter on his desk after he left the office. Not exactly what I had in mind, but it’d suffice. Ares King wouldn’t bat an eye when he sees it. All I care about is what comes after.

I pressed the keycard at the doorknob, and it opened with a soft click. I didn’t tell him I was coming, but I was hoping to stop by after having such a hectic day.

I struggled to take off my stilettos. This was the worst day to forget my flats, now my feet are all sore.

I flipped on the light switch. “You won’t believe the day I had. Don’t worry, I did it. Well, not as planned, but… It’s still a win.”

I dropped my bag, striding to the fridge for water, but I paused midway when I spotted an open bottle of champagne with two wine glasses.

*Did he have someone over?*

I cast a brief look around the apartment before bringing my gaze back to them. I narrowed my eyes when I caught a stain… *a red lipstick.*

“You’re so beautiful.”

*That was Dan’s voice*. It was coming from the room.

“You like that, don’t you, Danny? Like the way I ride your cock?”

The other one gets to stay and play around with us.” 

The kidnapper’s gun barrel wavered between me and my husband’s childhood sweetheart, Scarlett Hayes. 

And my husband, Harry Vance, he chose to take Scarlett. 

A bone-deep chill gripped me. I stared at him, disbelief twisting my gut.”Harry Vance,” I choked out, “I’m your wife!” 

A flicker of guilt crossed Harry’s eyes, but his resolve remained unwavering. 

“Claire,” he said, his voice tight, “I owe Scarlett my life. I can’t just leave her.” 

He paused, his voice softening. 

“Don’t be scared,” he whispered, “even if… no matter what they do to you… I’ll still love you.” 

His words were a blade, plunged deep into my chest, twisting. 

Menu 

“But I don’t owe her anything!” I shrieked, the words tearing from my throat.”Harry, if you walk out of here with her today, we are done! We will never get back together!” 

Harry’s eyes welled, but he still stooped, carefully lifting the unconscious Scarlett into his arms. 

“Don’t rush off, Mr. Vance!” A voice drawled from the shadows, thick with lewd intent. 

A kidnapper let out a guttural laugh, his fingers already on his belt buckle, as he and the others started to close in. 

“And the boys haven’t had their fun with Mrs. Vance yet!” 

The moment the warehouse door slammed shut, my world imploded. 

The kidnapper ripped my shirt open, his rough palm pressing against the skin of 

my 

waist. 

“Everyone says Mr. Vance worships his wife,” the kidnapper sneered, his foul breath hot on my ear.”Guess he doesn’t love her that much, does 

he?” 

I thrashed, tears blurring my vision. 

Just as the kidnapper ripped my bra strap down, the warehouse door burst open- 

“Police! Don’t move!” 

A gunshot cracked, and the kidnapper pinning me down crumpled. 

I collapsed into a familiar embrace. 

“It’s alright, Claire, it’s alright…” Harry’s voice trembled.”I had an ambush set up outside the whole time. You’re safe…” 

A glacial chill settled deep in my bones. 

What did an ambush matter now? 

At the edge of life and death, he had still chosen Scarlett. 

“We’re… over…” 

With those words, I finally lost consciousness. 

The next time I woke, the familiar ceiling of my bedroom greeted me. 

My fingers twitched, only to find them tightly clasped. 

“You’re awake?” Harry instantly hunched over me, his eyes rimmed with a profound darkness.”Water? Are you hungry? I had the housekeeper make your favorite-” 

you 

walked away with Scarlett?” 

“Harry.” I cut him off, my voice sharp.”Do you remember what I said when y 

His body went rigid. 

“I want a divorce.” 

My voice was frighteningly calm. 

“You just woke up, you need more rest. I’ll go out and get you some wontons.” Harry deliberately avoided my gaze. 

“Avoiding it won’t help.” I pushed myself up, each word falling heavy and deliberate.”Let’s talk about the divorce.” 

His back visibly stiffened, a faint tremor running through him, but he still strode quickly out of the bedroom, forgetting even his jacket. 

I stared at the closed bedroom door, and a memory from five years ago suddenly surfaced. 

7:00:55 

< Claire’s Story 1 

Menu 

Back then, he had just taken over Vance Corp, swamped with work every day, barely able to catch his breath. Yet he would still drive across half the city, just to bring me a bowl of hot wontons. 

“Claire, open up,” he’d say, always wanting to feed me back then, his eyes so tender it almost seemed unreal.”Careful, it’s hot.” 

But now, he couldn’t even bring himself to look at me. 

I forced myself to sit up, opened my laptop, and began drafting the divorce papers. 

Truth be told, Harry and I had been deeply in love. 

So much so that when Scarlett, his childhood friend, caused a scene at the company, he could coldly tell her in front of everyone:”Scarlett, I don’t like you. Have some self-respect.” 

So much so that when Scarlett purposely stumbled into his arms, he would immediately push her away and text me right after:”Claire, someone took advantage of me again. Only a kiss from my wife can make it better.” 

Until that earthquake- 

Scarlett risked her life to rescue him, but was crushed by a falling beam herself, breaking two ribs. 

From that day on, everything changed. 

“Claire, Lettie saved my life,” he’d pleaded, the first time he’d ever asked anything for Scarlett.”She just wants a job at Vance Corp…” 

“Claire, Lettie’s not doing well.” He’d stood me up for Scarlett for the first time. “I’m taking her to the hospital…” 

“Claire, Lettie…” 

Once. Twice. Countless times. 

I understood his guilt. 

But when that guilt, time and again, trampled over our marriage, even my own safety- 

I was exhausted. 

The phone on the coffee table rang just as I slid the signed divorce papers into a file folder. I picked it up, realizing it was Harry’s brother. 

The moment I pressed answer, his voice, frantic and distorted, spilled from the speaker 

“Sister-in-law! You need to get to the Family Mausoleum! Harry made me whip him ninety-nine times to apologize to you. He’s covered in blood now, and he says he won’t get up until you forgive him…” 

My lips twisted. 

Harry was always like this. Every time he hurt me because of Scarlett, he’d find some even more extreme way to prove his love. 

Just like last time, when he stood me up for Scarlett, only to buy an entire rose garden to apologize the next day. 

Just like the time before that, he’d celebrated Scarlett’s birthday, forgetting our anniversary, only to then shell out a fortune on a necklace as an apology. 

Now, it was time for the lashes. 

Did he truly believe a back raw and mutilated with wounds could erase the fact that in a life-or-death moment, he’d chosen her? 

Did he imagine ninety-nine lash marks could possibly erase the terror of my clothes being ripped away by the kidnappers, all while he walked out, cradling Scarlett in his arms? 

Did he truly believe…if only he suffered enough, I would simply melt? 

But this time, I wouldn’t. 

Clutching the divorce papers in my hand, I grabbed my coat and walked out the door. 

Inside the Family Mausoleum, Harry, still in his impeccably tailored suit, knelt before the ancestral tablets. A vast expanse of his back was a crimson mess, skin flayed open, flesh exposed, blood steadily trickling down his spine and soaking into the fabric at his waist. 

When he saw me enter, the defeated, ashen light in his eyes suddenly sparked. 

“Claire…” He stretched a weak hand toward me.”Please, just forgive me? I’ve explained everything about the kidnapping, didn’t I? I would never let anything happen to you… You’re the only one I’ve ever loved, the only one. I can’t live without you…” 

I slowly walked up to him, my gaze falling on the red mark near his collarbone. 

“You say you only love me,” I scoffed.”Then what is this?” 

Harry’s face drained of color.”Lettie said she’d never given a guy a hickey before and insisted on trying it out on me. She saved my life, I 

couldn’t refuse her…” 

013 

< Claire’s Story 1 

He fumbled for a small dagger.”Don’t be angry, I’ll cut this flesh right off!” 

Menu 

Under everyone’s shocked gaze, the blade plunged into his skin without hesitation. Blood streamed down his neck, staining the collar of his white shirt crimson. 

“Harry!” His guys immediately rushed forward to snatch the knife away.”Are you out of your mind?” 

The Family Mausoleum erupted into chaos. 

Several of his men frantically searched for a first-aid kit. Others looked at me, their eyes red-rimmed.”Claire, who in our circle doesn’t know how much Harry cares for you? Last year when you were hospitalized with allergies, he stayed by your side for three days and three nights without closing his eyes…” 

“Last month, you’d casually mentioned a fondness for the cherry blossoms in South End. He’d dropped millions, having twenty mature trees transplanted to his villa overnight.” 

“Just forgive him, Claire. It’s nothing, a tiny mistake. Are you really trying to push him over the edge?” 

A tiny mistake? Overreacting? 

I laughed, the sound hollow, my eyes burning. 

Harry pushed past the men, stumbling to his knees before me. 

Blood had already soaked half his collar, but he seemed oblivious to the pain, just looking up at me, his voice a raw plea.”Claire, forgive me…” 

I gazed down at the man I had once loved to my very core and suddenly felt utterly exhausted. 

“Fine,” I said, taking a deep, shuddering breath.”I can forgive you.” 

Harry’s eyes instantly brightened, a spark of hope flickering to life. 

“I have my eye on a house,” I said, pulling a document from my purse.”Buy it for me, and I’ll forgive you.” 

His heart soared with relief. He eagerly flipped open the document, about to read it, when his phone suddenly rang. 

“Harry…” Scarlett’s tearful voice came through the receiver. “I’m running a 102-degree fever. I feel awful…” 

Harry’s expression tightened. Without a glance at the document’s contents, he scribbled his signature, then looked up at me, his eyes pleading. 

“Go,” I said, my voice level. 

A visible wave of relief washed over him. He pushed to his feet, a cautious, almost disbelieving glance aimed my way.”Claire,” he asked, “you’re not angry?” 

I shook my head.”No,” I said, my tone even. 

Only then did the tension drain from his shoulders. He strode away, his group of buddies falling in behind him. 

As I watched their retreating figures, I slowly, deliberately, unfolded the document in my hand. 

The words “Divorce Agreement” stared back at me, Harry’s name scrawled on the signature line, still wet with ink. My fingers ghosted over the still-wet ink. A bitter, mirthless smile touched my lips. 

Harry, congratulations. 

This time, you’ve pushed me out of

Yesterday, my husband and I were in our tiny apartment with cheap wine. Celebrating. 

Because we’d finally paid off his million-dollar debt. Five years of hell-over. 

Then today, his FIANCÉE walks through our door. 

Lawyer at her side. Divorce papers in hand. 

“Miss Winters, thank you for these five years. You’ve been amazing.” She said, smiling like I’m the nanny she’s firing. 

“But Jake’s REAL wife and Anson’s REAL mom is back now. So let’s not make this messy. Time to go.” 

My brain shuts down. I can’t speak. Can’t move. 

It turned out that five years of my life? Just a “human stress test” Jake had to pass before daddy handed him the keys to the kingdom. 

It turned out that my husband? NOT my husband. My son? NOT my son! 

All just a test. A game. 

And me? I was nobody. A random pick. A prop during this shit show. 

BULLSHIT! They thought I’d take this? Swallow it down and leave quietly? 

WRONG! 

Jake Sutherland loved playing poor? Fine. 

Then I’ll make sure he be poor. For REAL this time. 

Yesterday, Jake and I were in our shoebox apartment, raising cheap wine to celebrate. We’d finally paid off his million-dollar debt. 

Today, his FIANCÉE Rosalie Laurent is at my door with a lawyer, sliding divorce papers across the table. 

“Sloane.” Her voice is warm, practiced. “Thank you for these five years. You’ve been amazing.” 

She smiles like she’s dismissing a nanny. “But Jake’s REAL wife is back now. Anson’s REAL mom. So let’s keep this clean, okay? Time for you to go.” 

My mind goes blank. I try to speak. Nothing comes out. 

Rosalie sees it. She picks up the remote and turns on the TV. 

0.0% 

Tested Me with Fake Poverty? Pay Me Real Billions, Darling 

Chapter 1 

Jake fills the screen. Sharp suit. Perfect smile. The headline reads: 

“Jake Sutherland: Sole Heir Returns.” 

The anchor’s voice is full of praise. “After completing his grassroots training, Jake Sutherland has proven himself to the board. Sources say he went from nothing to building a multi-million-dollar company-all in just five years…” 

Every word is a knife. 

He took everything-every shift I worked, every dollar I saved, every piece of myself I gave up-and turned it into his success story? 

Rosalie keeps talking. Smiling. “It was a test, Sloane. A pressure test. To see if Jake could handle real life before taking over the family business.” 

She pauses. 

“And you?” Her eyes sweep across our cramped living room. 

When she looks back at me again, there’s pity. 

“You were just part of the test. Randomly selected. Nothing personal.” 

She tilts her head. “You played the wife really well, though.” 

“But the show’s over now.” 

My phone buzzes after they leave. The screen lights up: JAKE. 

I pick up without thinking. 

His voice cuts through, cold and flat. 

“Sloane. The whole broke-couple thing? It’s done. You made it to the end. But you didn’t pass the test.” 

“Test?” 

“Yeah. Test.” He laughs-short, sharp. “I had to prove to the board I could build something from nothing. That I could find someone loyal enough to stick around through the worst of it. Rosalie bankrolled the whole thing. She’s my real fiancée. You? You were just the stand-in. A random pick to play the wife.” 

My chest tightens. “So the debt… it was all fake?” 

“It was startup capital with a different name. Had to make it sound bad enough to see how you’d react under pressure.” 

My nails dig into my palm. “You’re a piece of shit, Jake.” 

“Maybe.” He doesn’t even flinch. “But this piece of shit just inherited a billion-dollar company. There’s a check on the coffee table. Take it. Sign the papers. Walk away. Don’t embarrass yourself now.” 

Chapter 1 

He pauses. Then he goes for the kill. 

“Oh-and Anson? She’s not yours. Never was. Rosalie and I did IVF years ago. The embryos we made together? They got swapped out before implantation.” 

“You were just watching him for us. Now his actual mom’s back. So pack your stuff and get out. The house belongs to the Sutherlands.” 

His words hit me like ice water. My whole body goes cold. 

Like someone just shoved me into a freezer. 

“Rosalie and the lawyers are already there. They’ll walk you through it. And Sloane?” His voice drops. “Don’t make a scene. Keep it together.” 

The line goes dead. 

I’m still gripping the phone. It feels like it’s burning a hole through my hand. 

Watching her for us. 

That’s all I ever was. A stand-in. A prop in their story.

My ovarian cyst ruptured, sending excruciating pain through my body. But my parents, my brother, and even my fiancé were all busy celebrating my sister Faith’s college graduation.

I lay in a hospital bed, desperately needing a family member’s signature for emergency surgery, but every call I made was either ignored or met with an abrupt click.

A moment later, a text from my fiancé, Garrett Prescott, lit up my screen.

“Willow, stop being so dramatic. Today is a huge day for Faith. Whatever it is can wait until the party is over.”

I set my phone down and signed the surgical consent form myself.

This wasn’t the first time they had chosen my sister, Faith Vaughn, over me. But this time, something inside me shattered.

I wouldn’t let their favoritism sting me anymore. Instead, I would play the part of the obedient daughter they always wanted.

They would think I had finally learned my place, never suspecting I was planning to disappear from their lives forever.

————————

1

For three days in the hospital, my phone remained silent. Not a single message from my family.

I didn’t call them again either. I stopped the years-long habit of refreshing their social media feeds, searching for any sign of them.

I just lay there, dragging my weak, post-operative body to follow-up appointments and paying my own medical bills.

The day I was discharged, I didn’t tell anyone. I silently packed my things and, through the stabbing pain in my abdomen, shuffled home.

When I pushed open the front door, the cheerful laughter in the living room instantly froze.

They were all there. My fiancé Garrett’s arm was casually draped over Faith’s shoulder as he sat nestled beside her on the sofa.

The moment he saw me, he snatched his hand back as if he’d been burned, a guilty smile flashing across his face. “Willow, you’re back! Where have you been the last few days?”

My brother, Mason Vaughn, let out a cold snort.

“Where do you think she’s been? Sulking somewhere because she didn’t want to come to Faith’s graduation party.”

“She can never stand to see Faith happy. Always has to ruin the mood.”

I said nothing, heading straight for my room.

Mason looked surprised that I didn’t fight back. Usually, a simple accusation of selfishness from him would send me into a spiral of desperate, tearful explanations.

But this time, I was silent.

My mother approached, holding out a milkshake.

“Willow, honey, we were all so wrapped up in Faith’s graduation the other day that we missed your calls. You’re not mad at us, are you?” She pressed a peanut butter milkshake into my hand.

My heart was already numb, but a dull ache still throbbed within it.

I’m severely allergic to peanuts. Faith loves them.

So, the house was always stocked with peanut-flavored snacks and drinks. But no matter how many times I told them, no one ever remembered I couldn’t even touch them.

I tried to hand the cup back to my mother, taking a small step away. “I’m not angry. I’m just going to my room.”

The moment I turned, a loud bang echoed through the house.

My father had shot to his feet, slamming his palm on the coffee table. He roared, “Why the long face the second you walk in? Your mother apologized and even brought you your favorite drink!”

“What’s with the attitude? We’ve spoiled you absolutely rotten!”

My chest tightened until even breathing hurt.

Tears blurred my vision, but I took the cup from my mother’s hand and downed the entire thing in one long swallow.

Then, I gently set the empty cup down, wiped the tears from my eyes, and looked at my father with unnerving calm. “Faith is the one who likes peanut butter. I’m allergic.”

“But it’s okay. I’ve finished it. Can I go to my room now?”

“Willow! Why didn’t you say you were allergic? Who told you to drink it? Why must you be so stubborn!” my mother shrieked, panicking as she patted my back frantically.

My father looked embarrassed but stubbornly retorted, “Well, you could have just said something!”

“You’re always so difficult. Nothing like Faith. At least she knows how to talk to people.”

From the sofa, Faith’s voice drifted over. “Dad, don’t say that to Willow. You’ll hurt her feelings.”

Her voice was gentle, but the triumphant glint in her eyes was impossible to miss.

This was Faith’s favorite game: using my flaws to polish her own halo. She competed with me for everything, never satisfied until I was utterly crushed.

I should have been heartbroken, but my heart was just a hollow cavity. Even this humiliation couldn’t faze me anymore.

The other one gets to stay and play around with us.” 

The kidnapper’s gun barrel wavered between me and my husband’s childhood sweetheart, Scarlett Hayes. 

And my husband, Harry Vance, he chose to take Scarlett. 

A bone-deep chill gripped me. I stared at him, disbelief twisting my gut.”Harry Vance,” I choked out, “I’m your wife!” 

A flicker of guilt crossed Harry’s eyes, but his resolve remained unwavering. 

“Claire,” he said, his voice tight, “I owe Scarlett my life. I can’t just leave her.” 

He paused, his voice softening. 

“Don’t be scared,” he whispered, “even if… no matter what they do to you… I’ll still love you.” 

His words were a blade, plunged deep into my chest, twisting. 

Menu 

“But I don’t owe her anything!” I shrieked, the words tearing from my throat.”Harry, if you walk out of here with her today, we are done! We will never get back together!” 

Harry’s eyes welled, but he still stooped, carefully lifting the unconscious Scarlett into his arms. 

“Don’t rush off, Mr. Vance!” A voice drawled from the shadows, thick with lewd intent. 

A kidnapper let out a guttural laugh, his fingers already on his belt buckle, as he and the others started to close in. 

“And the boys haven’t had their fun with Mrs. Vance yet!” 

The moment the warehouse door slammed shut, my world imploded. 

The kidnapper ripped my shirt open, his rough palm pressing against the skin of 

my 

waist. 

“Everyone says Mr. Vance worships his wife,” the kidnapper sneered, his foul breath hot on my ear.”Guess he doesn’t love her that much, does 

he?” 

I thrashed, tears blurring my vision. 

Just as the kidnapper ripped my bra strap down, the warehouse door burst open- 

“Police! Don’t move!” 

A gunshot cracked, and the kidnapper pinning me down crumpled. 

I collapsed into a familiar embrace. 

“It’s alright, Claire, it’s alright…” Harry’s voice trembled.”I had an ambush set up outside the whole time. You’re safe…” 

A glacial chill settled deep in my bones. 

What did an ambush matter now? 

At the edge of life and death, he had still chosen Scarlett. 

“We’re… over…” 

With those words, I finally lost consciousness. 

The next time I woke, the familiar ceiling of my bedroom greeted me. 

My fingers twitched, only to find them tightly clasped. 

“You’re awake?” Harry instantly hunched over me, his eyes rimmed with a profound darkness.”Water? Are you hungry? I had the housekeeper make your favorite-” 

you 

walked away with Scarlett?” 

“Harry.” I cut him off, my voice sharp.”Do you remember what I said when y 

His body went rigid. 

“I want a divorce.” 

My voice was frighteningly calm. 

“You just woke up, you need more rest. I’ll go out and get you some wontons.” Harry deliberately avoided my gaze. 

“Avoiding it won’t help.” I pushed myself up, each word falling heavy and deliberate.”Let’s talk about the divorce.” 

His back visibly stiffened, a faint tremor running through him, but he still strode quickly out of the bedroom, forgetting even his jacket. 

I stared at the closed bedroom door, and a memory from five years ago suddenly surfaced. 

7:00:55 

< Claire’s Story 1 

Menu 

Back then, he had just taken over Vance Corp, swamped with work every day, barely able to catch his breath. Yet he would still drive across half the city, just to bring me a bowl of hot wontons. 

“Claire, open up,” he’d say, always wanting to feed me back then, his eyes so tender it almost seemed unreal.”Careful, it’s hot.” 

But now, he couldn’t even bring himself to look at me. 

I forced myself to sit up, opened my laptop, and began drafting the divorce papers. 

Truth be told, Harry and I had been deeply in love. 

So much so that when Scarlett, his childhood friend, caused a scene at the company, he could coldly tell her in front of everyone:”Scarlett, I don’t like you. Have some self-respect.” 

So much so that when Scarlett purposely stumbled into his arms, he would immediately push her away and text me right after:”Claire, someone took advantage of me again. Only a kiss from my wife can make it better.” 

Until that earthquake- 

Scarlett risked her life to rescue him, but was crushed by a falling beam herself, breaking two ribs. 

From that day on, everything changed. 

“Claire, Lettie saved my life,” he’d pleaded, the first time he’d ever asked anything for Scarlett.”She just wants a job at Vance Corp…” 

“Claire, Lettie’s not doing well.” He’d stood me up for Scarlett for the first time. “I’m taking her to the hospital…” 

“Claire, Lettie…” 

Once. Twice. Countless times. 

I understood his guilt. 

But when that guilt, time and again, trampled over our marriage, even my own safety- 

I was exhausted. 

The phone on the coffee table rang just as I slid the signed divorce papers into a file folder. I picked it up, realizing it was Harry’s brother. 

The moment I pressed answer, his voice, frantic and distorted, spilled from the speaker 

“Sister-in-law! You need to get to the Family Mausoleum! Harry made me whip him ninety-nine times to apologize to you. He’s covered in blood now, and he says he won’t get up until you forgive him…” 

My lips twisted. 

Harry was always like this. Every time he hurt me because of Scarlett, he’d find some even more extreme way to prove his love. 

Just like last time, when he stood me up for Scarlett, only to buy an entire rose garden to apologize the next day. 

Just like the time before that, he’d celebrated Scarlett’s birthday, forgetting our anniversary, only to then shell out a fortune on a necklace as an apology. 

Now, it was time for the lashes. 

Did he truly believe a back raw and mutilated with wounds could erase the fact that in a life-or-death moment, he’d chosen her? 

Did he imagine ninety-nine lash marks could possibly erase the terror of my clothes being ripped away by the kidnappers, all while he walked out, cradling Scarlett in his arms? 

Did he truly believe…if only he suffered enough, I would simply melt? 

But this time, I wouldn’t. 

Clutching the divorce papers in my hand, I grabbed my coat and walked out the door. 

Inside the Family Mausoleum, Harry, still in his impeccably tailored suit, knelt before the ancestral tablets. A vast expanse of his back was a crimson mess, skin flayed open, flesh exposed, blood steadily trickling down his spine and soaking into the fabric at his waist. 

When he saw me enter, the defeated, ashen light in his eyes suddenly sparked. 

“Claire…” He stretched a weak hand toward me.”Please, just forgive me? I’ve explained everything about the kidnapping, didn’t I? I would never let anything happen to you… You’re the only one I’ve ever loved, the only one. I can’t live without you…” 

I slowly walked up to him, my gaze falling on the red mark near his collarbone. 

“You say you only love me,” I scoffed.”Then what is this?” 

Harry’s face drained of color.”Lettie said she’d never given a guy a hickey before and insisted on trying it out on me. She saved my life, I 

couldn’t refuse her…”

< Claire’s Story 1 

He fumbled for a small dagger.”Don’t be angry, I’ll cut this flesh right off!” 

Menu 

Under everyone’s shocked gaze, the blade plunged into his skin without hesitation. Blood streamed down his neck, staining the collar of his white shirt crimson. 

“Harry!” His guys immediately rushed forward to snatch the knife away.”Are you out of your mind?” 

The Family Mausoleum erupted into chaos. 

Several of his men frantically searched for a first-aid kit. Others looked at me, their eyes red-rimmed.”Claire, who in our circle doesn’t know how much Harry cares for you? Last year when you were hospitalized with allergies, he stayed by your side for three days and three nights without closing his eyes…” 

“Last month, you’d casually mentioned a fondness for the cherry blossoms in South End. He’d dropped millions, having twenty mature trees transplanted to his villa overnight.” 

“Just forgive him, Claire. It’s nothing, a tiny mistake. Are you really trying to push him over the edge?” 

A tiny mistake? Overreacting? 

I laughed, the sound hollow, my eyes burning. 

Harry pushed past the men, stumbling to his knees before me. 

Blood had already soaked half his collar, but he seemed oblivious to the pain, just looking up at me, his voice a raw plea.”Claire, forgive me…” 

I gazed down at the man I had once loved to my very core and suddenly felt utterly exhausted. 

“Fine,” I said, taking a deep, shuddering breath.”I can forgive you.” 

Harry’s eyes instantly brightened, a spark of hope flickering to life. 

“I have my eye on a house,” I said, pulling a document from my purse.”Buy it for me, and I’ll forgive you.” 

His heart soared with relief. He eagerly flipped open the document, about to read it, when his phone suddenly rang. 

“Harry…” Scarlett’s tearful voice came through the receiver. “I’m running a 102-degree fever. I feel awful…” 

Harry’s expression tightened. Without a glance at the document’s contents, he scribbled his signature, then looked up at me, his eyes pleading. 

“Go,” I said, my voice level. 

A visible wave of relief washed over him. He pushed to his feet, a cautious, almost disbelieving glance aimed my way.”Claire,” he asked, “you’re not angry?” 

I shook my head.”No,” I said, my tone even. 

Only then did the tension drain from his shoulders. He strode away, his group of buddies falling in behind him. 

As I watched their retreating figures, I slowly, deliberately, unfolded the document in my hand. 

The words “Divorce Agreement” stared back at me, Harry’s name scrawled on the signature line, still wet with ink. My fingers ghosted over the still-wet ink. A bitter, mirthless smile touched my lips. 

Harry, congratulations. 

This time, you’ve pushed me out of 

your 

world with your own hands. ",1,1766477181.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

Because we’d finally paid off his million-dollar debt. Five years of hell-over. 

Then today, his FIANCÉE walks through our door. 

Lawyer at her side. Divorce papers in hand. 

“Miss Winters, thank you for these five years. You’ve been amazing.” She said, smiling like I’m the nanny she’s firing. 

“But Jake’s REAL wife and Anson’s REAL mom is back now. So let’s not make this messy. Time to go.” 

My brain shuts down. I can’t speak. Can’t move. 

It turned out that five years of my life? Just a “human stress test” Jake had to pass before daddy handed him the keys to the kingdom. 

It turned out that my husband? NOT my husband. My son? NOT my son! 

All just a test. A game. 

And me? I was nobody. A random pick. A prop during this shit show.

WRONG! 

Jake Sutherland loved playing poor? Fine. 

Then I’ll make sure he be poor. For REAL this time.

She smiles like she’s dismissing a nanny. “But Jake’s REAL wife is back now. Anson’s REAL mom. So let’s keep this clean, okay? Time for you to go.” 

My mind goes blank. I try to speak. Nothing comes out. 

Rosalie sees it. She picks up the remote and turns on the TV.

Tested Me with Fake Poverty? Pay Me Real Billions, Darling 

Chapter 1 

Jake fills the screen. Sharp suit. Perfect smile. The headline reads: 

“Jake Sutherland: Sole Heir Returns.” 

The anchor’s voice is full of praise. “After completing his grassroots training, Jake Sutherland has proven himself to the board. Sources say he went from nothing to building a multi-million-dollar company-all in just five years…” 

Every word is a knife. 

He took everything-every shift I worked, every dollar I saved, every piece of myself I gave up-and turned it into his success story? 

Rosalie keeps talking. Smiling. “It was a test, Sloane. A pressure test. To see if Jake could handle real life before taking over the family business.” 

She pauses. 

“And you?” Her eyes sweep across our cramped living room. 

When she looks back at me again, there’s pity. 

“You were just part of the test. Randomly selected. Nothing personal.” 

She tilts her head. “You played the wife really well, though.” 

“But the show’s over now.” 

My phone buzzes after they leave. The screen lights up: JAKE. 

I pick up without thinking. 

His voice cuts through, cold and flat. 

“Sloane. The whole broke-couple thing? It’s done. You made it to the end. But you didn’t pass the test.” 

“Test?” 

“Yeah. Test.” He laughs-short, sharp. “I had to prove to the board I could build something from nothing. That I could find someone loyal enough to stick around through the worst of it. Rosalie bankrolled the whole thing. She’s my real fiancée. You? You were just the stand-in. A random pick to play the wife.” 

My chest tightens. “So the debt… it was all fake?” 

“It was startup capital with a different name. Had to make it sound bad enough to see how you’d react under pressure.” 

My nails dig into my palm. “You’re a piece of shit, Jake.” 

“Maybe.” He doesn’t even flinch. “But this piece of shit just inherited a billion-dollar company. There’s a check on the coffee table. Take it. Sign the papers. Walk away. Don’t embarrass yourself now.” 

Chapter 1 

He pauses. Then he goes for the kill. 

“Oh-and Anson? She’s not yours. Never was. Rosalie and I did IVF years ago. The embryos we made together? They got swapped out before implantation.” 

“You were just watching him for us. Now his actual mom’s back. So pack your stuff and get out. The house belongs to the Sutherlands.” 

His words hit me like ice water. My whole body goes cold. 

Like someone just shoved me into a freezer. 

“Rosalie and the lawyers are already there. They’ll walk you through it. And Sloane?” His voice drops. “Don’t make a scene. Keep it together.” 

The line goes dead. 

I’m still gripping the phone. It feels like it’s burning a hole through my hand. 

Watching her for us. 

That’s all I ever was. A stand-in. A prop in their story.

“But Jake’s REAL wife and Anson’s REAL mom is back now. So let’s not make this messy. Time to go.” 

My brain shuts down. I can’t speak. Can’t move. 

It turned out that five years of my life? Just a “human stress test” Jake had to pass before daddy handed him the keys to the kingdom. 

It turned out that my husband? NOT my husband. My son? NOT my son! 

All just a test. A game. 

And me? I was nobody. A random pick. A prop during this shit show. 

BULLSHIT! They thought I’d take this? Swallow it down and leave quietly? 

WRONG! 

Jake Sutherland loved playing poor? Fine. 

Then I’ll make sure he be poor. For REAL this time. 

Yesterday, Jake and I were in our shoebox apartment, raising cheap wine to celebrate. We’d finally paid off his million-dollar debt. 

Today, his FIANCÉE Rosalie Laurent is at my door with a lawyer, sliding divorce papers across the table. 

“Sloane.” Her voice is warm, practiced. “Thank you for these five years. You’ve been amazing.” 

She smiles like she’s dismissing a nanny. “But Jake’s REAL wife is back now. Anson’s REAL mom. So let’s keep this clean, okay? Time for you to go.” 

My mind goes blank. I try to speak. Nothing comes out. 

Rosalie sees it. She picks up the remote and turns on the TV.

Tested Me with Fake Poverty? Pay Me Real Billions, Darling 

Chapter 1 

Jake fills the screen. Sharp suit. Perfect smile. The headline reads: 

“Jake Sutherland: Sole Heir Returns.” 

The anchor’s voice is full of praise. “After completing his grassroots training, Jake Sutherland has proven himself to the board. Sources say he went from nothing to building a multi-million-dollar company-all in just five years…” 

Every word is a knife. 

He took everything-every shift I worked, every dollar I saved, every piece of myself I gave up-and turned it into his success story? 

Rosalie keeps talking. Smiling. “It was a test, Sloane. A pressure test. To see if Jake could handle real life before taking over the family business.” 

She pauses. 

“And you?” Her eyes sweep across our cramped living room. 

When she looks back at me again, there’s pity. 

“You were just part of the test. Randomly selected. Nothing personal.” 

She tilts her head. “You played the wife really well, though.” 

“But the show’s over now.” 

My phone buzzes after they leave. The screen lights up: JAKE. 

I pick up without thinking. 

His voice cuts through, cold and flat. 

“Sloane. The whole broke-couple thing? It’s done. You made it to the end. But you didn’t pass the test.” 

“Test?” 

“Yeah. Test.” He laughs-short, sharp. “I had to prove to the board I could build something from nothing. That I could find someone loyal enough to stick around through the worst of it. Rosalie bankrolled the whole thing. She’s my real fiancée. You? You were just the stand-in. A random pick to play the wife.” 

My chest tightens. “So the debt… it was all fake?” 

“It was startup capital with a different name. Had to make it sound bad enough to see how you’d react under pressure.” 

My nails dig into my palm. “You’re a piece of shit, Jake.” 

“Maybe.” He doesn’t even flinch. “But this piece of shit just inherited a billion-dollar company. There’s a check on the coffee table. Take it. Sign the papers. Walk away. Don’t embarrass yourself now.” 

Chapter 1 

He pauses. Then he goes for the kill. 

“Oh-and Anson? She’s not yours. Never was. Rosalie and I did IVF years ago. The embryos we made together? They got swapped out before implantation.” 

“You were just watching him for us. Now his actual mom’s back. So pack your stuff and get out. The house belongs to the Sutherlands.” 

His words hit me like ice water. My whole body goes cold. 

Like someone just shoved me into a freezer. 

“Rosalie and the lawyers are already there. They’ll walk you through it. And Sloane?” His voice drops. “Don’t make a scene. Keep it together.” 

The line goes dead. 

I’m still gripping the phone. It feels like it’s burning a hole through my hand. 

Watching her for us. 

That’s all I ever was. A stand-in. A prop in their story. 

And now that the curtain’s down, they’re taking it all back-and throwing me out with the trash. ",1,1766476685.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

My ovarian cyst ruptured, sending excruciating pain through my body. But my parents, my brother, and even my fiancé were all busy celebrating my sister Faith’s college graduation.



I lay in a hospital bed, desperately needing a family member’s signature for emergency surgery, but every call I made was either ignored or met with an abrupt click.



A moment later, a text from my fiancé, Garrett Prescott, lit up my screen.



“Willow, stop being so dramatic. Today is a huge day for Faith. Whatever it is can wait until the party is over.”



I set my phone down and signed the surgical consent form myself.



This wasn’t the first time they had chosen my sister, Faith Vaughn, over me. But this time, something inside me shattered.



I wouldn’t let their favoritism sting me anymore. Instead, I would play the part of the obedient daughter they always wanted.



They would think I had finally learned my place, never suspecting I was planning to disappear from their lives forever.



————————



1



For three days in the hospital, my phone remained silent. Not a single message from my family.



I didn’t call them again either. I stopped the years-long habit of refreshing their social media feeds, searching for any sign of them.



I just lay there, dragging my weak, post-operative body to follow-up appointments and paying my own medical bills.



The day I was discharged, I didn’t tell anyone. I silently packed my things and, through the stabbing pain in my abdomen, shuffled home.



When I pushed open the front door, the cheerful laughter in the living room instantly froze.



They were all there. My fiancé Garrett’s arm was casually draped over Faith’s shoulder as he sat nestled beside her on the sofa.



The moment he saw me, he snatched his hand back as if he’d been burned, a guilty smile flashing across his face. “Willow, you’re back! Where have you been the last few days?”



My brother, Mason Vaughn, let out a cold snort.



“Where do you think she’s been? Sulking somewhere because she didn’t want to come to Faith’s graduation party.”



“She can never stand to see Faith happy. Always has to ruin the mood.”



I said nothing, heading straight for my room.



Mason looked surprised that I didn’t fight back. Usually, a simple accusation of selfishness from him would send me into a spiral of desperate, tearful explanations.



But this time, I was silent.



My mother approached, holding out a milkshake.



“Willow, honey, we were all so wrapped up in Faith’s graduation the other day that we missed your calls. You’re not mad at us, are you?” She pressed a peanut butter milkshake into my hand.



My heart was already numb, but a dull ache still throbbed within it.



I’m severely allergic to peanuts. Faith loves them.



So, the house was always stocked with peanut-flavored snacks and drinks. But no matter how many times I told them, no one ever remembered I couldn’t even touch them.



I tried to hand the cup back to my mother, taking a small step away. “I’m not angry. I’m just going to my room.”



The moment I turned, a loud bang echoed through the house.



My father had shot to his feet, slamming his palm on the coffee table. He roared, “Why the long face the second you walk in? Your mother apologized and even brought you your favorite drink!”



“What’s with the attitude? We’ve spoiled you absolutely rotten!”



My chest tightened until even breathing hurt.



Tears blurred my vision, but I took the cup from my mother’s hand and downed the entire thing in one long swallow.



Then, I gently set the empty cup down, wiped the tears from my eyes, and looked at my father with unnerving calm. “Faith is the one who likes peanut butter. I’m allergic.”



“But it’s okay. I’ve finished it. Can I go to my room now?”



“Willow! Why didn’t you say you were allergic? Who told you to drink it? Why must you be so stubborn!” my mother shrieked, panicking as she patted my back frantically.



My father looked embarrassed but stubbornly retorted, “Well, you could have just said something!”



“You’re always so difficult. Nothing like Faith. At least she knows how to talk to people.”



From the sofa, Faith’s voice drifted over. “Dad, don’t say that to Willow. You’ll hurt her feelings.”



Her voice was gentle, but the triumphant glint in her eyes was impossible to miss.



This was Faith’s favorite game: using my flaws to polish her own halo. She competed with me for everything, never satisfied until I was utterly crushed.



I should have been heartbroken, but my heart was just a hollow cavity. Even this humiliation couldn’t faze me anymore.



“I’m sorry,” I said. “It won’t happen again.”



As the words left my lips, everyone in the room just stared at me, stunned into silence.

Uhm, so little context I guess. Growing up I always thought that my mum is the good parent. My dad was aggressive alcoholic who beat mum and occasionally us (me and my brother) too. Of course in my teenage years I realized, that she could have leave him, instead she stayed and that hurt us, but she was still a victim in my eyes and I didn't really blame her, because just like her, I have a big problem with confrontation (where did that come from I wonder XD). And she even divorced him in the end. Which is where I noticed her true nature. She made me go see him, even though she promised the decision about seeing him is fully my. She forbidded me seeing my boyfriend who was the only safe space I had in the time of chaotic divorce. And there was more, but that's not why I'm here now. Point is, after I moved out I quite quickly realized that she is just as bad as dad. She might have not beat us, but she let him, she was emotionally unavailable and when I had serious troubles in school, she either didn't do anything or sad it to dad (who beat us...)

When I realized these thinks, I lost my empathy for her and I realized a lot of my mental and personal problems are her doing as well as father's. But I still didn't think she is a bad person. I thought that she put herself first, before us, but it might just as well be a survival instinct, what do I know. I was more disappointed than mad. That changed last week when I visited her (after a long time, to be honest). 

There were some other family members too and everyone wanted coffee (we're kinda coffee family), but I said I'll do just water. Coffee makes me poop sometimes and I wasn't feeling exactly good that day and I had to go shopping after that too, so I didn't want to risk anything. Mum made coffees for everyone else and I got my glass and filled it myself so she doesn't have to go back and forth. When others arived, mom gave them the coffees saying which one is for whom and then she said ""Kay (me) doesn't have a coffee, she always has to be a bit extra"". A bit extra? For what? For wanting water that I myself got? What the f-? This little note quite got me since I don't understand when on earth I've been extra. 

My theory is that it was because I'm quite different thant the rest of my family. They all drink, and I hate alcohol, dad smokes, mum used to, then quit and lately she uses e-cigarette (or how you call it in english) which I also avoid and I have no desire for it. Mum with her boyfriend also smoke weed from time to time. Parents and brother too had bad marks in school, I was all As girl, smart and responsible. Maybe that's the reason for saying I'm extra. ""You don't fit in."" That's how the note felt to me... 
I also remembered one similiar note few years ago, and I noticed a pattern. During the messy divorce I ran from home for a weekend and left a 4 pages long letter about my feelings. When I came back, the only think I was met with was ""You're selfish, I was counting on you to watch over your brother"" (which I didn't know in advance). About two years later, whe was with her friends and I unexpectedly showed up so she invited me in for a while, only to hit me after few minutes with ""she is such a good girl when she doesn't run out of house, you know?"" Why I see a pattern? About 3-4 months ago I wrote my mum, that her boyfriend is saying really hurtful things about my husband and that we are not comfortable seeing him right now and that she should talk to my brother, because the things he said were kinda hurtful to him too (they are in similiar situation). She didn't even respond to that and my brother said she never talked to him about it. She seems to say things like that after I stand up to her in some way... But these are the only two situations I remember. Firstly I don't really stand up to anyone XD. Secondly I don't remember most of my life, probably a trauma response. So... I'm asking.

My ovarian cyst ruptured, sending excruciating pain through my body. But my parents, my brother, and even my fiancé were all busy celebrating my sister Faith’s college graduation.



I lay in a hospital bed, desperately needing a family member’s signature for emergency surgery, but every call I made was either ignored or met with an abrupt click.



A moment later, a text from my fiancé, Garrett Prescott, lit up my screen.



“Willow, stop being so dramatic. Today is a huge day for Faith. Whatever it is can wait until the party is over.”



I set my phone down and signed the surgical consent form myself.



This wasn’t the first time they had chosen my sister, Faith Vaughn, over me. But this time, something inside me shattered.



I wouldn’t let their favoritism sting me anymore. Instead, I would play the part of the obedient daughter they always wanted.



They would think I had finally learned my place, never suspecting I was planning to disappear from their lives forever.



————————



1



For three days in the hospital, my phone remained silent. Not a single message from my family.



I didn’t call them again either. I stopped the years-long habit of refreshing their social media feeds, searching for any sign of them.



I just lay there, dragging my weak, post-operative body to follow-up appointments and paying my own medical bills.



The day I was discharged, I didn’t tell anyone. I silently packed my things and, through the stabbing pain in my abdomen, shuffled home.



When I pushed open the front door, the cheerful laughter in the living room instantly froze.



They were all there. My fiancé Garrett’s arm was casually draped over Faith’s shoulder as he sat nestled beside her on the sofa.



The moment he saw me, he snatched his hand back as if he’d been burned, a guilty smile flashing across his face. “Willow, you’re back! Where have you been the last few days?”



My brother, Mason Vaughn, let out a cold snort.



“Where do you think she’s been? Sulking somewhere because she didn’t want to come to Faith’s graduation party.”



“She can never stand to see Faith happy. Always has to ruin the mood.”



I said nothing, heading straight for my room.



Mason looked surprised that I didn’t fight back. Usually, a simple accusation of selfishness from him would send me into a spiral of desperate, tearful explanations.



But this time, I was silent.



My mother approached, holding out a milkshake.



“Willow, honey, we were all so wrapped up in Faith’s graduation the other day that we missed your calls. You’re not mad at us, are you?” She pressed a peanut butter milkshake into my hand.



My heart was already numb, but a dull ache still throbbed within it.



I’m severely allergic to peanuts. Faith loves them.



So, the house was always stocked with peanut-flavored snacks and drinks. But no matter how many times I told them, no one ever remembered I couldn’t even touch them.



I tried to hand the cup back to my mother, taking a small step away. “I’m not angry. I’m just going to my room.”



The moment I turned, a loud bang echoed through the house.



My father had shot to his feet, slamming his palm on the coffee table. He roared, “Why the long face the second you walk in? Your mother apologized and even brought you your favorite drink!”



“What’s with the attitude? We’ve spoiled you absolutely rotten!”



My chest tightened until even breathing hurt.



Tears blurred my vision, but I took the cup from my mother’s hand and downed the entire thing in one long swallow.



Then, I gently set the empty cup down, wiped the tears from my eyes, and looked at my father with unnerving calm. “Faith is the one who likes peanut butter. I’m allergic.”



“But it’s okay. I’ve finished it. Can I go to my room now?”



“Willow! Why didn’t you say you were allergic? Who told you to drink it? Why must you be so stubborn!” my mother shrieked, panicking as she patted my back frantically.



My father looked embarrassed but stubbornly retorted, “Well, you could have just said something!”



“You’re always so difficult. Nothing like Faith. At least she knows how to talk to people.”



From the sofa, Faith’s voice drifted over. “Dad, don’t say that to Willow. You’ll hurt her feelings.”



Her voice was gentle, but the triumphant glint in her eyes was impossible to miss.



This was Faith’s favorite game: using my flaws to polish her own halo. She competed with me for everything, never satisfied until I was utterly crushed.



I should have been heartbroken, but my heart was just a hollow cavity. Even this humiliation couldn’t faze me anymore.



“I’m sorry,” I said. “It won’t happen again.”

Strategic Dietary Changes:

Here are some of the dietary changes we can make:

- Prioritize Magnesium: Magnesium is a ""relaxation mineral"" that helps regulate the adrenal glands. Focus on leafy greens (spinach/kale), pumpkin seeds, almonds, and dark chocolate (at least 70% cacao).
- Increase Omega-3s: Fatty fish like salmon, sardines, and mackerel, or plant sources like chia seeds and walnuts, help reduce the inflammation that often drives high cortisol.
- Support Gut Health: There is a direct link between your gut and your brain (the gut-brain axis). Probiotic foods like Greek yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and kombucha can help lower stress hormones.
- Stabilize Blood Sugar: Avoid the ""spike and crash"" cycle by pairing carbohydrates with protein or healthy fats. For example, instead of just an apple, have an apple with almond butter.
- Limit Stimulants: Caffeine can spike cortisol levels for several hours. If you can't quit coffee, try to have it after a meal rather than on an empty stomach, and avoid it after 2:00 PM.",1,1766475940.0,applebodyshape,3,1.0,False

He is from a minority religious group in my country and it is a well-known fact in my country that that minority religious group likes to stay violent in a sense. So they can make sure that everyone else doesn't fuck with them.  And he's the only one of that minority group that works at the factory i work at thus he is also a minority at his job and he tries to act violent in the most minor of cases to sound tough and keep everyone ""in check"" his act falls down the moment someone of equal strength or stronger calls him out on his bullshit or gets serious enough about it but often times he comes after the normal workers and the ones he thinks are lesser and weaker than him often boasting about his matrial arts training and about his kickboxing abilites and its not like there arent a punch of objects all around me i can use to cave his head in or make his wife and family wish he wasnt as violent but i am not that kind of a person i hate violance and i dont want to get to the day when i find myself forced to harm him will enough that i end up incpacatiting him and or seroiusly hurting him because i dont want to go to jail 


Dont tell me to tell HR or managment because 3 years ago he fought with one of the factorys owners he was gonna beat him but he didnt and he got seriously shouted at but nothing more he wasnt fired he wasnt let go he was reprimanded seriously and most important he didnt even get written up which means they know about him They know 

He smokes weed after 9am which is the time of the coffee break so until 2 or 3pm he is calm he is most explosive betwen 7.30 and 10 and 3 to 4pm because often  ""his gf back in the day wife today"" or someone else would call him and they would fight and he starts to curse and beat shit and stops working and if you tell him to do something he explodes in your face and him being a shift supervisor means he has other responsibilities that he has to do that.We can't do, for example, driving the forklift. And fixing the machine and bringing stuff that we put the coffee bags , the packaged bags on it creates this whole system where we become a dysfunctional workplace just because of him , because more often than not the other work, supervisors or other managers or whatever are doing something else, and they can't do the things that he's supposed to do.

Festive Foods That Are Easier to Tolerate Than You Think
When you’re on weight loss medication, the festive season can feel daunting. Rich meals, long eating windows, and social pressure often make people assume they’ll have to avoid most Christmas foods.

The good news? Many festive foods are far more tolerable than expected — especially when eaten in small portions and the right combinations.

This article highlights festive favourites that often sit well, plus how to enjoy them comfortably.

1. Roast Turkey or Chicken
Lean, high-protein meats are usually one of the easiest festive foods to tolerate.

Why it works:

High protein supports fullness and energy

Lower fat than many festive mains

Helps stabilise blood sugar

Tip: Choose white meat, eat slowly, and stop at the first sign of fullness.

2. Roast Vegetables
Roast carrots, parsnips, sprouts, green beans, and broccoli are often well tolerated in small portions.

Why they work:

Provide fibre without heaviness

Pair well with protein

Add volume without excess calories

Tip: Avoid heavily buttered or oil-soaked vegetables if digestion feels sensitive.

3. Potatoes (Smaller Portions)
Potatoes often get a bad reputation, but many people tolerate them well.

Why they work:

Gentle carbohydrate source

Help prevent fatigue and light-headedness

Support energy when appetite is low

Tip: Choose roast or boiled potatoes over creamy or cheesy versions.

4. Stuffing (A Small Spoonful)
Surprisingly, a small portion of stuffing is often fine.

Why it works:

Dense but satisfying

A little goes a long way

Helps you feel included without overdoing it

Tip: Treat it as a taste, not a portion.

5. Gravy
Gravy can actually make food easier to eat when appetite is low.

Why it works:

Adds moisture, making meals easier to swallow

Improves enjoyment without large volume

Tip: A drizzle is enough — avoid soaking the plate.

6. Cheese Boards (Mindful Portions)
Cheese often feels indulgent but is surprisingly filling in small amounts.

Why it works:

High protein and fat = satiety

Small portions satisfy cravings

Tip: Choose 1–2 pieces and pair with fruit or crackers.

7. Desserts (Yes — Really)
Many people tolerate dessert better than expected when eaten slowly.

Why it works:

Smaller appetite means smaller portions naturally

One chosen dessert is better than constant grazing

Tip: Pick one dessert you genuinely enjoy and eat it mindfully.

8. Warm Drinks
Hot drinks are often very soothing during the festive period.

Why they work:

Help with fullness cues

Reduce the urge to snack

Support hydration

Good options: herbal teas, black tea, coffee, hot water with lemon.

9. Festive Snacks (When Chosen Wisely)
You don’t have to avoid snacks entirely.

Better-tolerated options include:

A few nuts

Fruit

Cheese cubes

Crackers with protein

Tip: Sit down and snack intentionally — grazing is harder to tolerate.

1pto3o3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1pto3o3/any_chance_with_my_possibly_avoidant_ex_very_long/,Any chance with my possibly avoidant ex? VERY LONG!,"We had a very nice relationship, I never had an idea that this might end bad but I probably felt it subconsciously since I got anxious sometimes which I'm usually not, but sometimes he behaved differently than my exes and I simply wasn't used to this - postponed the first sex a lot (first it was ""i dont want to rush things, we have time, i'm taking you serious"", then he said he has a UTI, etc and I'm a simple woman, even though I didn't straight up think he must be lying, I kinda felt I must not be attractive enough. He reassured me that's not the case at all and I believed him, making out was passionate, honestly I never felt more wanted by anyone else before and I wanted him more than I wanted anyone else before, lol. But yeah, it was still weird he didn't want to have sex. It happened after like 2 months of dating first and he had ED. I didn't make a big deal out of it, but it bothered him obviously. During the relationship which lasted for 8 months we had sex maybe 5 times and while I still loved being with him anyway, I would have never broken up over this, it still made me a bit anxious but mainly because I felt it is a problem for him. We never talked about this because every time we had sex and the ED happened he would just find the most random topic immediately after stopping like whatever interesting article he just read the other day or something, so I got it, no talking about this at all. 

But I still wanted to somehow talk about it so around months 4-5 maybe I asked him if we can talk a bit and I told him I feel like this relationship is a bit too friendly, I feel like he's just hanging out with me bc he doesn't really hug me, or isn't that cuddly, etc. He looked like a puppy that's been shouted at or idk even though I think I was gentle, I literally only told him this and waited for his answer. He told me he's never been like that and also he doesn't feel this way, he brings me gifts, calls me all the time, spends all his time with me, helps me etc, he's just not that into random pysichal stuff, he can't say much, this is who he is. He wasn't defensive or angry, he looked devastated. And we're talking about an otherwise chill, charismatic, fun etc 40 years old man. I was surprised by his reaction but also I believed him and accepted his answer - it's not who he is and what he said was true and he was also consistent about those things, he showed up all the time, he called me a lot when we couldn't meet, I NEVER had to beg for his attention, he was basically lovebombing me for 7 months lol, but since my exes expressed their love via touches, cuddling, etc I got used to that and ""oh he expresses his love via more practical stuff"" wasn't my first thought. But I was totally fine with this after we talked.

There were only 2 times when he went MIA during the relationship, once his pet was very sick and he stayed at home to take care of him and I messaged him and he didn't reply basically for 2 days, not even an ""i'll text you later"" or something. I didn't make a deal out of this either, he came over after and I told him calmly (I was calm for real since I thought the pet was more important, it's not a big deal) I was only worried something really bad happened to the pet and that's why he didn't text so I would have been happy if he at least told me everything's fine. But that's it. He looked uncomfortable. The other time was when he was sick and told me he's been sleeping a lot but I was fine with that too, just obviously told him it's okay, I was just worried. Also it could have been true, sick people sleep and it was also only like 2 days, I asked him if he needs anything from the store since he lives close by, but he told me no, he can go to the store, he doesn't want me to go over. (He wasn't contagious but I - again - didn't think much about it, probably didn't want me to see him sick, that's not even avoidant behaviour, lot of people are like that.) 

Then he injured his ankle in july, stayed home, again, didn't want me to go over until he was somewhat better but then he had a sport competition in august. I asked him if he really wants to go, maybe he needs more time to heal but he instisted he's fine. (Btw everything else was still fine, still came over when he was better, still talked on the phone, etc.) Four of us went there, us and 2 friends. He couldn't finish the competition because of his ankle, medics had to pick him up, I was his emergency contact so I went to the medics but tbh I think he hated that I'm there ""taking care of him"", taking care meant I grabbed his stuff and brought him water lol, he almost looked like he's about to cry or idk. When his friends finished and they came and helped him go back to the car he immediately changed, he had a better mood, he barely talked to me on that weekend (we spent the weekend at his grandma's place) and almost only talked to his friends and I was just there lol. 

This was in the beginning of august and august was kinda weird because I think I felt he's being more distant but he made plans, like we were talking about doing stuff in october, he came over with a new series asking if I want to watch it because then he will wait and we can watch the new episodes together on wednesdays, he ordered some stuff and brought it over so I can try it because they'll order again next week at work and if I like it he'll order one for me too, etc so small random stuff but he was talking about stuff in the future. 

But then we had a tense night, he was cooking dinner and was upset about it for some reason and I got anxious again, I thought he had a problem with me because I asked him if he needs help and he told me no, I told him okay I'll just go take a shower then and he told me yeah that's fine, so I went to take a shower, he finished dinner, then we just watched a movie and went to bed but it seemed everything's fine by that time, and the next morning was again chill, we were talking, laughing while having coffee. But I was still anxious about that night so the next day I texted him that I kinda feel he's not being nice lately and some of his jokes also did hurt me a bit in the past couple of days, but I also reassured him that I like his jokes, it's just I feel I need a bit more kindness now. (PS: I had PMS lol, I didn't realize it.) Then he ghosted me for 2 days, lol. Messaged me wednesday he needs some time but he will come over saturday and we can talk. He didn't came over saturday because something came up. Then nothing, I did message him a few time, he always had some excuse, he's busy, he has some family issues, he got home late from work, etc. Two weeks passed like this so eventually I sent him a text that I can go over if he won't come over, to which he replied he's not at home at the moment and he won't be til late but he will come over monday and we can talk, he wanted some time to think about things and he wanted to think alone. 

So he came over monday and I got a speech about how he doesn't feel the spark, he only likes me as a friend, he works a lot so he doesn't have time for a relationship right now, he has commitment issues and we don't fit. I didn't understand the whole situation because he literally was talking about spending our whole life together like one and a half months ago - I mean he was talking about teaching me to fish and that when we grow old we can live in his grandma's house together, I can go fishing with him and I can read by the lake like his grandparents did and also when I WAS the one telling him it feels like a friendship he was denying it. I asked him about the ""we don't fit"" part because we literally were a perfect match in most of the important things, we liked the same things, shared the same values, had similar interests, same goals for the future, despite the ED the chemistry was very strong, we wanted to spend our free time the same ways, shared hobbies, even in small things like music taste, movies etc we matched. So his answer to my question, in what exactly we don't fit, he managed to say: ""You took too many sick leaves and I didn't like that."" I don't even remember what I said to that, it was so absurd. Then he talked about the no spark thing, how he doesn't feel like he could say ""i love you"" to me. I asked him if this is about the message I sent to him but he dismissed that, didn't even talk about my message, only told me no, that has nothing to do with this - but obviously it was at least a trigger since before my message there were zero signs of him wanting to break up, even though he seemed a bit distant, he was still talking about stuff in the future, still called me on the phone, came over on his own free will, when he kissed me it was still passionate etc. I told him if he needs more free time, we can spend less time together, he came over like 4 times a week and slept over, I never asked him for that much time, he wanted to come. But he told me no, that's not good because it would just create more distance. Basically at that point I couldn't say anything, he told me there's nothing wrong with me, it's him and also he informed me he did this 14 times before and there was nothing wrong with them either, it's him, he can't be in a relationship and I should hate him and move on. 

Which I didn't lol, I did send him a few messages on Messenger and this is where I think I messed up. He never replied, but he did read for like 2 months, then he stopped but I think he may have just turned off read receipts because when I sent him 2 messages in 2 weeks on another app, he did read those. But Messenger was the main channel, but eventually I stopped messaging. On december 14 I blocked him on Messenger because I felt like it will be easier for me to not want to message him and also not seeing him being online 24/7 and since he didn't seem like he's planning to reply I thought he won't even notice. On december 15 I get a notification that he revoked my access to his iCloud calendar, lol. One day after me blocking him, 100+ days after the break up, it might have been a coincidence but it's weird that he only remembered NOW that he has that shared. I unblocked him a day later, wanted to add him back as a friend on Facebook (I thought of this as a completely neutral thing, he never unfriended me and none of us shares much stuff so it's not like I want to stalk him, there's nothing to stalk) but 20 hours later he declined. Also I think his active status is off since the unblock, I'm pretty sure about that bc when the unblock period lifted he appeared online but then he disappeared and ever since then I only see him for seconds online sometimes which happens when status if off but Messenger still registers some activity for a second. And this is where we are now, lol. I didn't react anything to him canceling my request, I took that as the first obvious sign that he wants me to leave him alone and now he's basically doing everything to hide from me, the only thing he didn't do is that he didn't block me. 

I'm not planning to message him again. I was thinking if I could send him a happy new year message but decided againts it. We started talking last year around Christmas, we sent each other happy new year messages last year and our fist date was on january 3 so this time of the year is kinda emotionally heavy so I feel like it's best if I pretend I don't exist lol. 

Also he left all his stuff here, he told me at the break up he'll come back in a week and grabs them when I'm feeling better but obviously I didn't feel better in a week XDD I literally still have his keys to his apartment but at this point he probably just changed the locks rather than getting them. 

I'm fine now in a sense that I'm not anxiously waiting anymore that maybe TODAY he'll message me but I still prefer the idea of ""maybe someday"", and in the meanwhile I'm doing my stuff and if he never plans to talk to me again, maybe I'll really just get tired of thinking about him. I just don't know if there's any chance after this or if he's really an avoidant or just some guy who wasn't that into me - but guys who aren't that much into a girl are usually benefiting something out of her like sex lol, and he avoided sex too most of the time. I really thought that he just loves spending time with me and he never told me anything is bothering him. ",1,1766475697.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

A little intro about myself I'm quite fat, 110kg when I started - I started exercising again since July this year, was on a steady loss of weight of 1-2 kg monthly until October, during this period I was doing 2-3 cardios weekly, inbetween I took a break of 1 week-ish inbetween.

My weight in Oct was 105kg, then I started to do weights inbetween, I haven't been quite bothered with checking my weight since I was quite happy in the gym. Recently before i went on holiday I noticed my weight was 109+kg lol, some people told me its muscle weight gain. 

I did a body scan in October and just did one again last night, here's the scan results if anyone is interested to take a look : [https://imgur.com/a/SNxzGfv](https://imgur.com/a/SNxzGfv)

Was using chatgpt/gemini AI to help me breakdown the comparision : [https://imgur.com/a/EAoLYf1](https://imgur.com/a/EAoLYf1)

Seems like I am gaining muscle mass while losing fats, my current exercise regime is : 

* Day 1 : Cardio 1 hour, incline 13 speed 3.6 (i am slowly increasing speed/incline once i find the pace too comfortable, i started out with incline 10 45mins 3.5 speed)
* Day 2 : Cycling 30mins, upper body machines/weights 1 hour
* Day 3 : Cardio 1 hour
* Day 4 : Cycling 30mins, lower bottom machines/a bit of upper 1 hour
* Day 5 : Cardio 1 hour
* Day 6 : Weights / Machine 1 hour
* Day 7 : ? 

I will randomly take a break a day or two if i'm super busy or tired, but generally i'm sticking to something like that, i exercise mostly at nights where the gym have barely any people. In the day i try to do about 15mins of weights (5kg) 1 set or some simple exercises randomly as well.

I also got try doing some workouts at home on the stomach but I think the intensity is too much and it cause my body to ache a lot so I decided to slow down on those, else I'll feel very burn out and unmotivated to exercise.

Diet wise its not very healthy : 

* Breakfast I usually either eat yogurt with blueberries or milk (high protein milk by rokeby) with cereal 
* Lunch nowadays i eat mostly dapao food, like noodles or beehoon, very carb heavy
* Dinner also eat out, i try to eat more meat options 
* Sometimes after workout I will eat supper as well, kway teow goreng or 2 egg prata (i know this is an absolute no but my wife wants to eat supper and its hard to reject lol)
* I drink 1-2 cups of coffee daily, usually latte (homemade) and one cup of ice coffee outside (I try to order kopi-o less sugar)
* I have been drinking BBT quite alot for past few months (between oct to december) as well

Diet wise its not very healthy, once school starts I'll cook simple protein meals during lunch, i'm stopping sweet drinks again outside.

I am playing around with chatgpt and gemini, they are giving me some good solutions / plans but i thought to seek some opinions from the gurus here as well.

My plans: 

Once school starts, i will take off some of my night threadmill cardio and substitute with outdoor walks/jogs (I will slowly increment more speeds etc) but my target is 1 hour walk/jog minimally.

Also want to do some night cycles (20-40km) 

Not sure if I should be consuming more protein or not (buy consuming protein powder), I have been actively trying to eat more chicken or pork and adding protein into my diet.

Should i continue with what i'm doing / what I plan to do? Or is there a more efficient way to do things? (I'm too cheapskate to hire a PT btw haha)

1ptnyr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthtime_official/comments/1ptnyr6/indoor_walking_workouts_anyone_else_using_this_as/,Indoor walking workouts: anyone else using this as their main “at home” cardio?,"I was reading a Health-Time guide on indoor walking and realized it basically described the one form of cardio I have actually managed to stick with. It frames indoor walking not as “just marching in place,” but as a legit low impact workout if you do it with structure and intention.



A few key points that stuck with me:



* Indoor walking is joint friendly but still gets your heart rate up, which makes it good for beginners, people with extra weight, or anyone stuck inside.



* Form matters more than I thought: tall posture, relaxed shoulders, engaged core, and actually using your arms to drive intensity.



* Variety is huge. high knees, side steps, butt kicks, grapevine steps, and pace changes so it is not just the same slow march for 20 minutes.



* A simple structure works well. something like 3 minutes warm up, 15 minutes alternating brisk marching with “fancier” steps, then 2 minutes cool down and light stretching.



I tried their sample 20 minute routine in my living room and it honestly felt more like a real workout than half my “I will just scroll on the treadmill” sessions. Adding music made it much easier to keep going.



They also emphasize a couple of things we talk about here a lot: good shoes even indoors, not skipping warm ups and cool downs, and treating consistency as the main goal (20–30 minutes most days) instead of chasing one perfect long session. There were some helpful reminders around habit stacking too, like pairing an indoor walk with your morning coffee or a specific show.



Question for the sub:



1. If you have used indoor walking as part of your routine:
2. What structure or interval pattern actually kept you engaged.
3. Do you mix in strength moves (squats, light weights) or keep it pure walking.
4. Have you noticed changes in mood, energy, or weight from doing this regularly, or is it more of a “movement minimum” for you.



Curious to hear real experiences, especially from people who have stuck with it for months, not just one or two sessions.

1ptny99,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ptny99/i_was_warned_never_to_ignore_the_red_ink_rules_on/,"I was warned never to ignore the 'Red Ink' rules on my Army night shift. I didn't listen, and now I’m marked.","For those who didn't see my first report, [you can find the details here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1psti9l/im_a_sfc_on_staff_duty_i_ignored_the_red_ink_sop/).

Short recap; I’m a SFC (Sergeant First Class) in the army, and I’ve been in long enough to know that rules are usually there for a reason. But last night, I thought I knew better. I ignored the 'Red Ink' SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) while on staff duty, and I thought I’d gotten away with it.

I was wrong, and I brought the shift home with me....

I was in my apartment. My kitchen was exactly where it was supposed to be, but the hallway... the hallway was different. It was longer. And I was hearing that damn floor buffer again.

I’ve been off the desk for over twelve hours at that point, and should have been in a deep post-Staff Duty coma. Instead, I was standing in my pajamas with my knees bent inwards as I shook with my 9mm in hand.

I thought I escaped that building. I thought Miller being in the clinic meant the ""event"" was over. But when I woke up from a nap an hour ago, I realized I didn't bring just my laundry bag home.

I went into the kitchen to get a glass of water, and there, sitting on my counter, was a DA Form 1594. It wasn't a copy. It was the original from the desk. But the entries... they aren't mine. Carefully written in each block respectively, I read the notes:

>**1800:** *SFC Crawford arrived at residence. Subject believes he is off-duty. Subject is incorrect.*  
**1930:** *Subject entered REM sleep. The Third Floor moved into the crawlspace above Subject’s bedroom.*  
**2100:** *Subject is staring at this log. The Red Ink is dry. The Runner is waiting behind the refrigerator.*

I froze. I live alone. I checked the ""Red Ink"" folder I’d swiped—the one SSG Halloway told me was the *real* SOP. I flipped to a page I hadn’t seen before. It was hand-written, the ink so fresh it smeared under my thumb:

>**Rule #9: The Ghost Roster.**  
*If the NCO in Charge leaves the AO before the 'Recording' on the 3rd floor finishes, the AO expands to include the NCO’s primary residence. Do not check your closets. If you hear a floor buffer in your hallway, do not look at the floor. The 'Janitor' does not like to be watched while he cleans the blood.*

I heard it then. The unmistakable, rhythmic *whir-slap, whir-slap* of an industrial floor buffer. It was coming from my hallway—the one with the hardwood floors I just waxed last week.

I grabbed my phone to call 1SG, but the screen didn't show my wallpaper. It was a live feed of my own kitchen. In the video, I’m standing there looking at the 1594, but there’s a hand—a pale, grey hand with fingers that are too long—reaching out from the gap behind my fridge. It’s holding a pen. A red pen.

Then my phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number.  
*"" Hey, 'Sarnt, this is Miller. I’m at the clinic, but the doctors say I have 'Cursive Throat.' They’re going to sew my name tape onto my skin now. Are you coming to visit? The Third Floor missed you. It’s much bigger now. It’s everywhere.""*

I looked at the hallway. The floor buffer sound stopped. In the silence, I heard a TikTok audio. It was that same six-second clip that was playing on repeat from Miller's phone from the incident much earlier, but now the lyrics were just my own name being chanted in a guttural, wet rasp.

I’ve survived three deployments and 15 years of the green machine, but as I watch the door handle to my bedroom slowly turn, I shriek like a little girl as I realize the ""Red Ink"" SOP wasn't a warning for the building...

*It was a warning for me*.

I stood in my kitchen, my 9mm heavy in my hand. My apartment hallway didn’t lead to my bathroom anymore. It stretched into a dimly lit corridor of concrete and eggshell paint. The smell of industrial wax was overwhelming. I wasn't in my home; my home had been annexed by the 3rd floor.

Then I saw him.

Miller was standing at the end of the long hallway. He wasn't scrolling on his phone. He was holding a floor buffer, moving it in slow, rhythmic circles. His OCP uniform looked charred, and that cursive name tape was glowing a faint, sickly red.

""Sergeant First Class Crawford,"" he said, his voice sounding like it was coming from the bottom of a well. ""I didn't finish the log. You left before the 'Recording' ended. Now I have to stay until the ink runs out.""

I didn't think. I dropped the pistol. It wouldn't work against a ghost anyway. Then, I ran. I didn't run away from him, but rather, I ran *at* him. I grabbed him by his uniform top and slammed him against the wall. The wall felt like cold meat.

""PFC Miller, look at me!"" I roared, using my best 'drill sergeant' voice to break the trance. ""You are on my roster! I am your NCO! You do not take orders from a manila folder! We are clearing this AO right now!""

The floor buffer shrieked, a sound like a human scream. The 'Janitor', a shadow taller than the ceiling, bloomed behind Miller. I felt a searing heat, like the ""Heat Bloom"" from the parade field.

I pulled out the Manila folder. I realized then what the ""Red Ink"" really was. It wasn't just instructions; it was a contract.

""I’m the NCOIC!"" I shouted at the shadow. ""I am the primary hand-receipt holder! If Miller is 'Short' on his shift, I’ll cover the balance! Sign him over to me!""

I bit my thumb hard and smeared my own blood across the 'Relieved by' line on the DA Form 1594.

The world tilted. The sound of the TikTok audio reached a deafening crescendo and then... silence.

I blinked, and I was back in my kitchen. The hallway was normal again. The smell of wax was gone, replaced by the scent of my cold coffee. Miller was slumped on my floor, breathing hard, his uniform back to normal. No cursive. Just ""MILLER"" in standard block letters.

He looked up at me, his eyes clearing. ""Um.. 'Sarnt? Where are we? I thought... I thought I was on the 3rd floor."" I helped him up. He’s alive. He’s safe. He’s back on the roster.

  
It’s now 23:30. Miller is back at his barracks, tucked into his bunk. The clinic staff called me earlier, confused, asking how he’d 'discharged himself' without anyone seeing him leave. I told them he’d just walked back to the company area and I’d caught up with him. I’m a SFC; they didn't question me. They just filed the paperwork.

But I’m looking at my hand. The 'Red Ink' I used to sign the form? It didn't wash off. It’s stained into my skin, right across my palm. It’s a permanent hand-receipt.

I’m still deployment ready. My PT score is good, and my weapon is clean. But I know that the next time my name is on that Duty Roster, the folder won't be behind the printer. It’ll be waiting on the desk, already open to my name. If it's anything that might give me PTSD, it won't be my past deployments, but rather, this damned staff duty I now have to deal with.

The 3rd floor didn't want Miller. It wanted an NCO.

I have Staff Duty again in three weeks. Gods help whoever is my Runner for that...",4,1766475140.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

My (UK36) two rescue brothers (indoor pussos) are really well behaved. Like truly good boys. had them since 2021 from 2 yrs old and they've only pooped out their box once and they never rough each other up too greatly. 

  
I've been off sick from work for weeks and they've become massively clingy, which is fine! I love them. But when I have important things to do at the computer, they're all over me. I've mostly accomadated, but today I had to focus on my work so I told one of my cat's 'no' when he tried to sit on me. 

  
They always listen when I say no, so he left. except he didn't. He went to the coffee table behind me and JUMPED on my back, with every single nail. 

  
I didn't react right away. I know with cats it's better to hold still and let them correct themselves and he did jump down. But I PROPER went off on him. I did spank his bum but it wasn't hard, only as hard as I spank him for bumdrums, but i did it whilst screaming at him. Like, tears in my eyes. Then every time he tried coming back immediately after, I kept shouting no and pointing and he kept leaving the room. And he has left me alone now for nearly an hour. 

  
The thing is, does that even work? Does he even comprehend why I'm shouting at him? I feel really bad but I don't know how else to make sure he understands that was really wrong. Terrified he's gonna try it again! 





tl;dr Cat jumped on my back. Pretty nasty cuts. I shouted at him for like an entire minute, slapped his bum (not hard but still shocked him) and kept shouting at him when he came near me. How bad of a reaction was that? Any advice? 



to add: We cut their nails because they love to flex their murder mits, but we only do it once a month and now they're sharper than ever. I'll definitely be upping their trims to twice monthly. ",2,1766474853.0,CATHELP,3,0.75,False

You learn to rely on no one. You become the dependable one, the “rock,” the one who always has it together. But when real intimacy enters the picture, it’s confusing. Someone wants to care for you, be in your space, know your emotions, and suddenly you’re like: why does this feel threatening?

This post is for anyone whose default setting is hyper-independence, who finds closeness anxiety-inducing, even when they deeply crave it. You’re not broken. This is surprisingly common, especially if you grew up in homes where vulnerability wasn’t safe or emotional needs weren’t prioritized. TikTok advice often misses the mark by glamorizing ""alpha independence"" or pushing toxic “avoidant” labels without helpful tools or context. So here’s a breakdown of what the research and real experts say actually works.

It's not your fault that intimacy feels like danger. But it is possible to rewire the way you respond, and it works faster than you think.

Here’s the best science-backed, therapist-approved stuff that helps:

- Understand where hyper-independence comes from
   Dr. Nicole LePera*, author of *How To Do The Work, explains that hyper-independence is usually a survival response. If you learned early that relying on others led to disappointment, criticism, or neglect, your nervous system adapted to equate closeness with danger.
   Trauma research from *The National Child Traumatic Stress Network shows that children who experience emotional neglect or inconsistent caregiving often develop an over-reliance on themselves as a protective mechanism.
   You didn’t become “too independent” out of ego. It was protection. But the problem is, safety became isolation.

Practice “earned security” (it’s a real thing)
   According to Dr. Dan Siegel, a pioneer in interpersonal neurobiology, you can move from insecure attachment patterns to secure ones at any stage in life. This is what’s called “earned secure attachment.”
   It starts by recognizing old patterns, like pulling away when someone gets emotionally close, and pausing instead of reacting.
   Try saying this internally: “This feels unsafe. But I’m not in danger. I’m just uncomfortable because this is new.”

 Use co-regulation instead of self-reliance
   Instead of always processing emotions alone, experiment with naming what you feel in real time with safe people.
     Example: “I want to spend time with you but I’m also feeling this urge to retreat. I think I’m scared of being too vulnerable.”
   The Huberman Lab Podcast talks about how co-regulation, syncing your nervous system with another’s, is one of the fastest ways to reduce anxiety and strengthen trust. Even 30 seconds of shared breathing can shift your state.

 Start with exposure, not immersion
    Don’t try to transform overnight. Instead of going from solo mode to full emotional vulnerability, use graded exposure. This comes from cognitive behavioral therapy.
    Start with tolerating small acts of intimacy. Let someone bring you coffee. Let them help with your to-do list. Allow them to ask “how are you really?” without deflecting.
   The Gottman Institute* recommends “turning toward bids”, when your partner reaches out emotionally, respond affirmatively even in small ways. These tiny gestures build trust over time.

 Reframe intimacy as strength, not weakness
    One of the biggest blocks is the belief that needing others makes you weak.
    Brené Brown’s* research on vulnerability shows that it’s actually the foundation of authenticity and courage. People who risk emotional exposure in relationships, even when it’s messy,  end up with stronger connections and more resilience.

 Look for “emotionally safe” relationships, not just exciting ones
    If you’re used to avoidance, secure people may feel “boring” at first, only because their steadiness doesn’t trigger your usual defense mechanisms.
    Dr. Stan Tatkin, who wrote Wired for Love, explains that the brain of an avoidant person can mistake chaos or aloofness for chemistry. Instead, look for people who are consistent, responsive, and communicate clearly. That’s safety, not boredom.

 Books + resources worth checking out
    “Attached”* by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller, explains anxious and avoidant attachment in simple language.
    “The Power of Attachment” by Diane Poole Heller, covers how to heal developmental trauma and shift into connection.
    “Polyvagal Exercises for Safety and Connection” by Deb Dana, practical tools for regulating your nervous system during intimacy.

You don’t have to pick between being strong and being loved. Real intimacy isn’t dependence. It’s mutual stability. It’s the ultimate upgrade to the kind of independence that actually sustains you, because now, you don’t have to hold the whole world alone.

My ovarian cyst ruptured, sending excruciating pain through my body. But my parents, my brother, and even my fiancé were all busy celebrating my sister Faith’s college graduation.



I lay in a hospital bed, desperately needing a family member’s signature for emergency surgery, but every call I made was either ignored or met with an abrupt click.



A moment later, a text from my fiancé, Garrett Prescott, lit up my screen.



“Willow, stop being so dramatic. Today is a huge day for Faith. Whatever it is can wait until the party is over.”



I set my phone down and signed the surgical consent form myself.



This wasn’t the first time they had chosen my sister, Faith Vaughn, over me. But this time, something inside me shattered.



I wouldn’t let their favoritism sting me anymore. Instead, I would play the part of the obedient daughter they always wanted.



They would think I had finally learned my place, never suspecting I was planning to disappear from their lives forever.



————————



1



For three days in the hospital, my phone remained silent. Not a single message from my family.



I didn’t call them again either. I stopped the years-long habit of refreshing their social media feeds, searching for any sign of them.



I just lay there, dragging my weak, post-operative body to follow-up appointments and paying my own medical bills.



The day I was discharged, I didn’t tell anyone. I silently packed my things and, through the stabbing pain in my abdomen, shuffled home.



When I pushed open the front door, the cheerful laughter in the living room instantly froze.



They were all there. My fiancé Garrett’s arm was casually draped over Faith’s shoulder as he sat nestled beside her on the sofa.



The moment he saw me, he snatched his hand back as if he’d been burned, a guilty smile flashing across his face. “Willow, you’re back! Where have you been the last few days?”



My brother, Mason Vaughn, let out a cold snort.



“Where do you think she’s been? Sulking somewhere because she didn’t want to come to Faith’s graduation party.”



“She can never stand to see Faith happy. Always has to ruin the mood.”



I said nothing, heading straight for my room.



Mason looked surprised that I didn’t fight back. Usually, a simple accusation of selfishness from him would send me into a spiral of desperate, tearful explanations.



But this time, I was silent.



My mother approached, holding out a milkshake.



“Willow, honey, we were all so wrapped up in Faith’s graduation the other day that we missed your calls. You’re not mad at us, are you?” She pressed a peanut butter milkshake into my hand.



My heart was already numb, but a dull ache still throbbed within it.

My ovarian cyst ruptured, sending excruciating pain through my body. But my parents, my brother, and even my fiancé were all busy celebrating my sister Faith’s college graduation.

I lay in a hospital bed, desperately needing a family member’s signature for emergency surgery, but every call I made was either ignored or met with an abrupt click.

A moment later, a text from my fiancé, Garrett Prescott, lit up my screen.

“Willow, stop being so dramatic. Today is a huge day for Faith. Whatever it is can wait until the party is over.”

I set my phone down and signed the surgical consent form myself.

This wasn’t the first time they had chosen my sister, Faith Vaughn, over me. But this time, something inside me shattered.

I wouldn’t let their favoritism sting me anymore. Instead, I would play the part of the obedient daughter they always wanted.

They would think I had finally learned my place, never suspecting I was planning to disappear from their lives forever.

1

For three days in the hospital, my phone remained silent. Not a single message from my family.

I didn’t call them again either. I stopped the years-long habit of refreshing their social media feeds, searching for any sign of them.

I just lay there, dragging my weak, post-operative body to follow-up appointments and paying my own medical bills.

The day I was discharged, I didn’t tell anyone. I silently packed my things and, through the stabbing pain in my abdomen, shuffled home.

When I pushed open the front door, the cheerful laughter in the living room instantly froze.

They were all there. My fiancé Garrett’s arm was casually draped over Faith’s shoulder as he sat nestled beside her on the sofa.

The moment he saw me, he snatched his hand back as if he’d been burned, a guilty smile flashing across his face. “Willow, you’re back! Where have you been the last few days?”

My brother, Mason Vaughn, let out a cold snort.

“Where do you think she’s been? Sulking somewhere because she didn’t want to come to Faith’s graduation party.”

“She can never stand to see Faith happy. Always has to ruin the mood.”

I said nothing, heading straight for my room.

Mason looked surprised that I didn’t fight back. Usually, a simple accusation of selfishness from him would send me into a spiral of desperate, tearful explanations.

But this time, I was silent.

My mother approached, holding out a milkshake.

“Willow, honey, we were all so wrapped up in Faith’s graduation the other day that we missed your calls. You’re not mad at us, are you?” She pressed a peanut butter milkshake into my hand.

My heart was already numb, but a dull ache still throbbed within it.

I’m severely allergic to peanuts. Faith loves them.

It’s been three years since I lost my vision. I know this because I have felt the cold touch of winter three times since then. Losing my vision is something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. It would be one thing if I were born without vision, but losing it in my late thirties only added to my midlife spiral. This spiral continued until 7:30 AM this morning, when I was offered an experimental drug that would gain some of my vision back. I was a little weary at first. I have never been one to take risks, even when I could see, but what more do I have to lose?

The knocking at the door woke me up from my inky slumber. An avalanche of beer cans crashed to the floor as I hobbled to my feet. How did I fall asleep in the recliner again? As I used my hand against the wall to guide me to the door, I could feel the aging wood moan, its many years of decay now crying out as it rotted in place. The person on the other side of the door didn’t stop knocking until I flung the door open. 

“What do you want?” I croaked out. “Good morning, sir! Sorry for waking you, but I have an offer you can’t refuse!” The man on the other side of the veil was too energetic for my liking; his tone sounded like he was holding back excitement over something I didn’t know. As he spoke, I could smell yesterday’s cigarettes and this morning's mint, which failed to mask the ashy scent. I was able to reply with “Just spill it already, I am a busy man” before the man chuckled. “Oh, I know you are, sir, but I have an offer of a lifetime. How would you like to be one of the first people on this planet to try our new miracle drug, Helio?” The man paused after excitedly spilling out his words, almost like he knew what he was going to say next. “Why would I try a 'miracle' drug? There’s no such thing, now get the hell off my porch before I-” But before I could finish slurring my words, the man cut me off. “I know this sounds too good to be true, but I can confirm it works! One pill of Helio is all you need to be able to see and more! Plus, if that doesn’t sway you, we are offering $15,000 to anyone willing to try”. I snorted and replied, “Oh, what bullshit”. As I started to close the door, it was suddenly stopped by a hand slamming on the door. 

The salesman was closer to me than expected. “Steven, I know about the accident. What more can you lose? We pay upfront, so even if it doesn’t work, you will still have the money to do whatever you like. Think about it.” After a few beats of silence, the man stepped back and started to walk away. It took me a moment to contemplate the choice: do I want to risk my life to take a drug that would probably fuck my life up, or do I want to continue my life in the dark? But at this point, what life was I even living?  “Wait, let me see the money first,” I called to him before he was out of earshot. The man let out a soft chuckle as tootsteps quickly rushed up the porch steps before placing a stack of newly printed money in my outstretched hand. The money felt crisp in the palm of my hand. Even though I wasn’t sure if it was the right amount of money, I didn’t care enough to be sure. “Listen, I will take the pill, but if anything goes wrong-” The man cut me off once again. “It won’t.” He said in a stern voice, the first time he was serious in the whole conversation. I felt the pill drop into my hand. It was slightly squishy, like the skin of a newborn. “Pleasure doing business with you, and here is my card”.

As I stumbled back into the living room, I considered even taking the pill at all. I could just take the money and throw the pill away. But as I was walking to the kitchen, I knocked a picture off the wall. The shattering of the glass was louder than I expected. I knew what that photo was; it was my wife and me on our wedding day. I can still remember what her dress looked like. The white dress flowed like a river as she walked down the aisle. If only I could hold her one more time. But I could see her picture one more time…..

“Fuck it,” I picked up a half-empty beer can on the floor and slammed the beer and pill without a second thought. After a few moments of standing in the darkness… nothing happened. “Miracle drug my ass.” As I was about to put the can in the recycling bin, a flutter of light crept into my vision, blinding me out of my eternal darkness. This was the first streak of light I have seen in years. Slowly, like an old TV being turned on, my kitchen became visibly in a static haze. I was able to look around and see my kitchen for the first time since the accident that took more away from me than I could ever have thought was possible.  The kitchen was covered in years' worth of garbage. I could always smell the heaping mound of trash scattered around, but I never gave it much thought since I couldn’t see it. “Holy shit,” I couldn’t believe it worked. I could feel the tears well up in my eyes. Without warning, part of my vision went back into the inky prison. I could still see my surroundings, but I could also see a black void. My mind was racing to figure out what was happening, but I got my answer before I figured it out. On my lower back near my waist line, I felt something….blink. Quickly, I felt around on my back until I poked it. The pain was excruciating; it felt like I got poked in the eye. Half in pain and confused, I stumbled into the bathroom. 

The man in the mirror was different than the last time I saw him. His eyes were bloodshot, like they had seen a world of pain, even though this was the first time they could see anything in a long time. All the light that used to radiate from him was now gone and replaced with a husk that oozed darkness. I spun around to find the painful spot on my back but as I lifted my shirt, I wished I had never done so. There, on my lower back, in between a brown mole and the back hair, was an eyeball. The eye was covered in a light coat of slime similar to a newborn baby. The eye was yellowed with the iris being a striking blue, which was different from my natural brown eyes. I screamed the second I saw it, backing away from the mirror. But what confused me more than anything was that I could see through it. It was like looking at a computer with multiple windows open. I could see through the eyes on my head, but also through the one on my back. 

I left the bathroom in a blur. I had to find the card to call the salesman back. As I rounded the corner into the living room, I felt a loud POP on the bottom of my left foot. Pain shot through my body like lightning as I crashed to the floor like a chopped-down tree. Through gritted teeth, I turned my foot towards me to get a look at what I stepped on. Only I didn’t step on anything that was scattered on the floor. Instead, I put all of my weight on a fresh new eyeball that formed on the bottom of my foot. The splattered eye pooled in a pond of blood as it hung on the crumbled optic nerve still connected to the inside of my foot. The new eye socket was less than 20 millimeters wide and oozed a milky white liquid. The white liquid and blood flowed into each other but refused to mix together, like oil and water. As I reached my hand to my foot, I could see my face looking back at me through one of my new eyes, which was now located on my right fingernail. I watched in disbelief as each of my fingernails split in the center to create an eye. Each time a new orb broke through the layer of skin, I was able to see through it, and the eyes darted around the room in a dizzying blur, making my head spin. Like it was the first time they could ever see. Using the palms of my hands so I didn’t pop more orbs, I crawled my way over to the coffee table, desperate to call the salesman. I could feel more and more eyes form all over my body. I could feel them mixed in with the hair on my scalp, on the inside of my armpits, between my toes, but when my tongue flicked over the front of my incisors, I could feel an eye forming on the front of each tooth. The eyelashes loosely clung to their sockets and trickled into my throat as I felt around. I did the only thing I could think of. I screamed. I screamed and screamed and screamed until the light faded out of all my eyes.

When I awoke, I was looking through a thousand eyes at once. A thousand images clashing into each other like a thousand memories happening at once. But these weren’t memories; this was all happening now. With a shaking hand, I felt over every inch of my body. There wasn’t a spot that wasn’t covered in an oozing eyeball, looking around in a panic, even my hand searching my body had eyes. When my hand and body touched each other, I could see and feel the eyes colliding and swapping the slime with each other. But I couldn’t just see what was in my room; I could see everything. The neighbor walking their dog outside, a plane flying over my house, a star going through a supernova. I could see it all. I have looked at every square inch of the universe, scanning every little detail. Every little galaxy, every glacier melting, every bus stopping at a red light. As I gazed into every atom of the universe, my body lay on the rotting floor of my living room. I will never stop looking until I find what I am looking for. 

I have seen everything, a god in a mortal shell, but I will never be able to see Jane.

Quizzes me on every penny.
Talks non stop about my life of Riley. I don’t have a life of Riley. I walk my dog and go to the gym. I cook clean and have a very poorly paid home job that hasn’t earned much. 

I was always a housewife and mum. Kids left home. I colour my own hair, go to hairdressers twice a year. I don’t do lunch or coffee as I don’t really know anyone. So no life of Riley. I have no money of my own, I have to ask for everything, he watches anything I spend from our joint account and I have to account for every penny. 

He has a social media account (facebook) and I’m no where on it. He’s not even ‘married’ on it just nothing. So I deleted mine as I was so sad seeing other people sharing pics of spouses, their profile picture being a couple, his picture was him on his motorbike. I got so down I no longer have facebook. 

He only wants to do things with my son, they are biker buddies and go to bike meets. (I don’t want to go to bike meets obviously and it’s nice he has a hobby ) but my hubby literally doesn’t want me doing anything with him. Yesterday he wanted to walk the dog…. On his own…. He has never ever walked the dog. 

I’m invisible to him. The only photos he has of me are from 15 years ago when I was 40. 
When I had an operation 3 years ago he showed the doctor an old picture and said to the doctor that I used to look like that, showing him the image (we all used to look better at 40) and that the operation had changed me 🤷‍♀️. I’d had a hysterectomy. My tummy at the time was swollen it’s since resided but I am 55. I go the gym everyday, and keep fit. I’m strong and healthy. He’s lost a lot of weight recently as he’s diabetic and tells me he’s thinner than me. 

He gaslights me over everything, he tells me one thing, I do it then he makes out no such thing was said. 

He literally has shown no interest in Christmas and I’ve now wrapped my own presents and written my own tag.

He moans I’ve spent money on Christmas food, moaned the chicken cost him £11. Moans I like wine, moans he has to buy me wine, I buy the cheapest wine I can get, counts the bottles and works out the cost. 
Moans when I do anything that involves money, he’s not impressed with the gym membership he’s cancel that if he could. 
He wants me back to work a proper job, but I’m not qualified to do anything after years of being a housewife. I applied to be a courier 🚚 but not heard anything back.
Am I stuck in a marriage sham. Trouble is I have nowhere to go. No family. No job and the only thing I can do is maybe be a cleaner or courier driver dropping off parcels. Maybe shop work. 
We barely talk and when we had a night out, I bought a gold dress and heels and he didn’t even look at me or say I looked nice…

Billie Eilish just released her newest song Birds of a feather followed by a hot new voice, one Sabrina Carpenter with espresso. Ai was still sadly Ai and then their was me.

I was at my new job at the point scrolling through work files when an odd thought crossed my mind. ""When was the last time i felt hungry?""

Sure i had, had cravings. Everyone does but when was the last time i was genuinely in need of eating. So i decided i would hold off om eating till I got hungry. 
The first day was easy i had a big breakfast so it made sense i wasnt hungry. Second day was a little shaky but ""hey just drink some coffee first"" by day 3 my then GF (bless her heart shes an angel) rushes me to the clinic.

Dr could of won a dr eggman contest hands down! And he considered himself a comedian. First meeting goes. He asks me what my diet is and admittedly it wasnt the best. I work in town and live in the middle of nowhere at this point. Its either fast food or waking up half a house for a grilled cheese. I took the fast food. 

Without reason he immediately blamed my problems on one particular restaurant and would hear nothing else about it. So we cut all fast food. It actually gets worse and my stomach starts to constantly bloat and swell. So back to the doctors we go...

After a second analysis he claims i drink too much hard liquor, and that its why im as swollen as i was. We cut out all hard alcohol it was hard at first. Suddenly i was no longer having cravings so we go back to the doctor.

At this point im not sure what could be my problem next. He had labs done on me the first time i had met wigh him over this.I sat in absolute amazement at what he did finally say. His grand idea after several very expensive tests?.............I drink too much beer...im sorry what? 

The tests hadnt figured anything out and this man just blamed beer. I lose it. I immediately unload on the man yelling about how he isnt listening. Honestly it was overboard but i was scared and he refused to listen to what updates i did have. After i was finished i had 3 tests i had been fighting to get done for over a year now approved. 

The first test was an mri to make sure i didnt have any other surprises i didnt know about. Thankfully that one was clear. Next was an endo and colonoscopy. The dr actually originally only ordered the colonoscopy but i got the endo because i prefer to know. 

Those led to one last test. Probably the worst test ever. The gastric emptying study. Literally eat eggs and stand in front of a machine periodically.  Thats it....its cool if you like eggs?

Gastro paresis 
Pretty much if its not mush and flavorless its not my friend. Its not the end of the world but its a learning curve im honestly not prepared for at this time. Though thats how the stories go lol. The hero gets the unbeatable mission and wins! Thats what my mind set has to be towards it and while im scared right now itll get easier with time.

To anyone who read this all the way through thank you. To those who just zipped down to the bottom to see what i said here......same...
when i met the rock and snoop dogg really were the only highlights.

She pauses. 

“And you?” Her eyes sweep across our cramped living room. 

When she looks back at me again, there’s pity. 

“You were just part of the test. Randomly selected. Nothing personal.”

“But the show’s over now.”

“Sloane. The whole broke-couple thing? It’s done. You made it to the end. But you didn’t pass the test.” 

“Test?” 

“Yeah. Test.” He laughs-short, sharp. “I had to prove to the board I could build something from nothing. That I could find someone loyal enough to stick around through the worst of it. Rosalie bankrolled the whole thing. She’s my real fiancée. You? You were just the stand-in. A random pick to play the wife.” 

My chest tightens. “So the debt… it was all fake?” 

“It was startup capital with a different name. Had to make it sound bad enough to see how you’d react under pressure.” 

My nails dig into my palm. “You’re a piece of shit, Jake.” 

“Maybe.” He doesn’t even flinch. “But this piece of shit just inherited a billion-dollar company. There’s a check on the coffee table. Take it. Sign the papers. Walk away. Don’t embarrass yourself now.”

He pauses. Then he goes for the kill.

Clean design and the signature sleeve stripes look great. Fabric feels decent, but it’s more of a lightweight hoodie than something for cold weather. Fit is a bit slim, which might not be for everyone.
Score: 8/10

2. Loro Piana Denim (Washed Blue)
Nice vintage-style wash and the denim feels comfortable right out of the gate. That said, the cut is pretty straightforward and doesn’t stand out much compared to other premium jeans.
Score: 7.5/10

3. Patagonia Fleece Vest (Black)
Very practical piece. Warm, lightweight, and easy to layer. Not really a fashion statement, but it does exactly what it’s supposed to do. Great for daily wear.
Score: 8/10

4. UGG Suede Boots (Beige)
Surprisingly comfortable with a solid sole. The suede looks good, but it might be a bit high-maintenance and prone to marks if you’re not careful. Still a cozy option.
Score: 8/10

5. Maison Margiela Knit Sweater (Olive) – Favorite
This is the standout for me. The knit texture, subtle details, and overall fit feel very refined. It looks simple at first glance but has that quiet, high-end vibe. Easily the most “special” piece in the haul.
Score: 9.5/10 ⭐

6. Fashion & Design Books Set
Nice decorative pieces for a shelf or coffee table. They add aesthetic value, though they’re more about visuals than deep reading.
Score: 7/10

7. Black Zip Knit Jacket
Simple and wearable, but slightly plain. The knit is fine, though it doesn’t have many details that make it memorable.
Score: 7/10

8. Thom Browne Crewneck Knit (Navy)
Classic Thom Browne look with the arm stripes. Quality is there, but the fit is very slim and might feel restrictive for some people.
Score: 8/10

9. Cream Half-Zip Knit Sweater
Clean color and nice texture. Good for layering, but the lighter color may show wear more easily over time.

It’s been three years since I lost my vision. I know this because I have felt the cold touch of winter three times since then. Losing my vision is something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. It would be one thing if I were born without vision, but losing it in my late thirties only added to my midlife spiral. This spiral continued until 7:30 AM this morning, when I was offered an experimental drug that would gain some of my vision back. I was a little weary at first. I have never been one to take risks, even when I could see, but what more do I have to lose?

The knocking at the door woke me up from my inky slumber. An avalanche of beer cans crashed to the floor as I hobbled to my feet. How did I fall asleep in the recliner again? As I used my hand against the wall to guide me to the door, I could feel the aging wood moan, its many years of decay now crying out as it rotted in place. The person on the other side of the door didn’t stop knocking until I flung the door open. 

“What do you want?” I croaked out. “Good morning, sir! Sorry for waking you, but I have an offer you can’t refuse!” The man on the other side of the veil was too energetic for my liking; his tone sounded like he was holding back excitement over something I didn’t know. As he spoke, I could smell yesterday’s cigarettes and this morning's mint, which failed to mask the ashy scent. I was able to reply with “Just spill it already, I am a busy man” before the man chuckled. “Oh, I know you are, sir, but I have an offer of a lifetime. How would you like to be one of the first people on this planet to try our new miracle drug, Helio?” The man paused after excitedly spilling out his words, almost like he knew what he was going to say next. “Why would I try a 'miracle' drug? There’s no such thing, now get the hell off my porch before I-” But before I could finish slurring my words, the man cut me off. “I know this sounds too good to be true, but I can confirm it works! One pill of Helio is all you need to be able to see and more! Plus, if that doesn’t sway you, we are offering $15,000 to anyone willing to try”. I snorted and replied, “Oh, what bullshit”. As I started to close the door, it was suddenly stopped by a hand slamming on the door. 

The salesman was closer to me than expected. “Steven, I know about the accident. What more can you lose? We pay upfront, so even if it doesn’t work, you will still have the money to do whatever you like. Think about it.” After a few beats of silence, the man stepped back and started to walk away. It took me a moment to contemplate the choice: do I want to risk my life to take a drug that would probably fuck my life up, or do I want to continue my life in the dark? But at this point, what life was I even living?  “Wait, let me see the money first,” I called to him before he was out of earshot. The man let out a soft chuckle as tootsteps quickly rushed up the porch steps before placing a stack of newly printed money in my outstretched hand. The money felt crisp in the palm of my hand. Even though I wasn’t sure if it was the right amount of money, I didn’t care enough to be sure. “Listen, I will take the pill, but if anything goes wrong-” The man cut me off once again. “It won’t.” He said in a stern voice, the first time he was serious in the whole conversation. I felt the pill drop into my hand. It was slightly squishy, like the skin of a newborn. “Pleasure doing business with you, and here is my card”.

As I stumbled back into the living room, I considered even taking the pill at all. I could just take the money and throw the pill away. But as I was walking to the kitchen, I knocked a picture off the wall. The shattering of the glass was louder than I expected. I knew what that photo was; it was my wife and me on our wedding day. I can still remember what her dress looked like. The white dress flowed like a river as she walked down the aisle. If only I could hold her one more time. But I could see her picture one more time…..

“Fuck it,” I picked up a half-empty beer can on the floor and slammed the beer and pill without a second thought. After a few moments of standing in the darkness… nothing happened. “Miracle drug my ass.” As I was about to put the can in the recycling bin, a flutter of light crept into my vision, blinding me out of my eternal darkness. This was the first streak of light I have seen in years. Slowly, like an old TV being turned on, my kitchen became visibly in a static haze. I was able to look around and see my kitchen for the first time since the accident that took more away from me than I could ever have thought was possible.  The kitchen was covered in years' worth of garbage. I could always smell the heaping mound of trash scattered around, but I never gave it much thought since I couldn’t see it. “Holy shit,” I couldn’t believe it worked. I could feel the tears well up in my eyes. Without warning, part of my vision went back into the inky prison. I could still see my surroundings, but I could also see a black void. My mind was racing to figure out what was happening, but I got my answer before I figured it out. On my lower back near my waist line, I felt something….blink. Quickly, I felt around on my back until I poked it. The pain was excruciating; it felt like I got poked in the eye. Half in pain and confused, I stumbled into the bathroom. 

The man in the mirror was different than the last time I saw him. His eyes were bloodshot, like they had seen a world of pain, even though this was the first time they could see anything in a long time. All the light that used to radiate from him was now gone and replaced with a husk that oozed darkness. I spun around to find the painful spot on my back but as I lifted my shirt, I wished I had never done so. There, on my lower back, in between a brown mole and the back hair, was an eyeball. The eye was covered in a light coat of slime similar to a newborn baby. The eye was yellowed with the iris being a striking blue, which was different from my natural brown eyes. I screamed the second I saw it, backing away from the mirror. But what confused me more than anything was that I could see through it. It was like looking at a computer with multiple windows open. I could see through the eyes on my head, but also through the one on my back. 

I left the bathroom in a blur. I had to find the card to call the salesman back. As I rounded the corner into the living room, I felt a loud POP on the bottom of my left foot. Pain shot through my body like lightning as I crashed to the floor like a chopped-down tree. Through gritted teeth, I turned my foot towards me to get a look at what I stepped on. Only I didn’t step on anything that was scattered on the floor. Instead, I put all of my weight on a fresh new eyeball that formed on the bottom of my foot. The splattered eye pooled in a pond of blood as it hung on the crumbled optic nerve still connected to the inside of my foot. The new eye socket was less than 20 millimeters wide and oozed a milky white liquid. The white liquid and blood flowed into each other but refused to mix together, like oil and water. As I reached my hand to my foot, I could see my face looking back at me through one of my new eyes, which was now located on my right fingernail. I watched in disbelief as each of my fingernails split in the center to create an eye. Each time a new orb broke through the layer of skin, I was able to see through it, and the eyes darted around the room in a dizzying blur, making my head spin. Like it was the first time they could ever see. Using the palms of my hands so I didn’t pop more orbs, I crawled my way over to the coffee table, desperate to call the salesman. I could feel more and more eyes form all over my body. I could feel them mixed in with the hair on my scalp, on the inside of my armpits, between my toes, but when my tongue flicked over the front of my incisors, I could feel an eye forming on the front of each tooth. The eyelashes loosely clung to their sockets and trickled into my throat as I felt around. I did the only thing I could think of. I screamed. I screamed and screamed and screamed until the light faded out of all my eyes.

When I awoke, I was looking through a thousand eyes at once. A thousand images clashing into each other like a thousand memories happening at once. But these weren’t memories; this was all happening now. With a shaking hand, I felt over every inch of my body. There wasn’t a spot that wasn’t covered in an oozing eyeball, looking around in a panic, even my hand searching my body had eyes. When my hand and body touched each other, I could see and feel the eyes colliding and swapping the slime with each other. But I couldn’t just see what was in my room; I could see everything. The neighbor walking their dog outside, a plane flying over my house, a star going through a supernova. I could see it all. I have looked at every square inch of the universe, scanning every little detail. Every little galaxy, every glacier melting, every bus stopping at a red light. As I gazed into every atom of the universe, my body lay on the rotting floor of my living room. I will never stop looking until I find what I am looking for. 

I have seen everything, a god in a mortal shell, but I will never be able to see Jane.

1ptnkr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortSadStories/comments/1ptnkr5/the_extra_chair/,The extra Chair,"Every night, my dad set an extra chair at the kitchen table.

It wasn’t for guests. We didn’t have many of those. And it wasn’t a habit from some old tradition. It was just… there. Same scratched wooden chair, pushed slightly away from the table, like someone might sit down late.

I asked him about it once when I was a kid.

He said, “In case someone needs it.”

That was all.

My dad was quiet in the way people get when they’ve already said everything important in their lives. He worked early mornings, came home smelling like dust and coffee, and watched the news without commenting. We didn’t talk much, but we understood each other well enough.

Years later, when his health started to fail, I moved back home. The house felt smaller. Quieter. The extra chair was still there.

One night, after a rough day, I finally asked him again.

“Who’s the chair really for?”

He took a long time to answer. Then he said, “Your mom used to sit there.”

She’d died before I was old enough to remember her. I knew the facts. The dates. But not that.

“I leave it out,” he continued, “because some losses don’t need fixing. They just need space.”

He passed a few months later.

When I cleaned out the house, I almost got rid of the chair. It was old. Uneven. Didn’t match anything I owned.

But now, in my apartment, it sits at my table.

I don’t know who it’s for yet.

Maybe it’s for the version of me that hasn’t arrived.

Or for someone who needs to rest for a while.

# Capítulo 1: The Devil’s Secretary

***\[Music: The Devil You Know By X Ambassadors\]***

*The Kings’.*

Every single person in Midnight City knew that name. It wasn’t just a name, but a brand… the epitome of the city’s very foundation.

I was the secretary to Ares King, CEO of King Corp. Yes, *the King.* The impenetrable billionaire bachelor with looks that could make you drop your panties and scream fuck me! *But personality?* Not so much, he’s a walking hump of ice who has one thing in mind. *Business.*

*2*

Those poor, unfortunate souls who thought they could have a chance with him are better off in the Bermuda Triangle.

As his secretary, I had to be flawless to the last detail, had to be three steps ahead, had to swallow up whatever emotional shit I’m going through, and act like my life is made of no worries.

When you work for Ares King, you’re not a person, just a tool to get things done, and questions are not asked.

But it’s time to close that chapter.

“Okay.” I pushed my glasses to the bridge of my nose. “Just press the damn button, Catherine. Don’t hold out on me now.”

I thought this was gonna be easy. I was expecting a swift decision, not hanging for the last hour.

I chewed on my nails as anxiety got the better of me. Realizing my habit, I forced my hand to my lap.

“Deep breaths, you can do this. You can—”

“Ms. Lane,” a deep, gruff voice came through the earpiece I wore.

I flinched, clicking print on impulse. *Great! Who knew that was the push I needed?*

“Y-Yes, Mr King?” I replied shakily, my heart in my throat.

“Coffee.”

The intercom went off, and I closed my eyes. After all this time, Catherine, you still haven’t gotten used to that voice.

I sighed when the printer made a soft humming noise. “One last coffee run for my devil boss.”

When I get back, I’m bringing my resignation letter to his office, and then this chapter is closed, *locked* with the key thrown into the abyss.

*1*

I pushed to my feet, my stilettos making a sharp click-clack. I opened the door and stepped into the bullpen, where rows of desks stretched out in a bland display, phones ringing and keyboards clacking with haste.

There wasn’t a single thing out of place, the perfect air for a billion-dollar company with overqualified people.

Unlike me, who had to work my ass from the gutter up, most of them here had privileges I didn’t.

I just happened to land this position because I passed the one-month trial period, aka *the curse month.* No one had lasted that long, hence the eerie label.

Either they get their heart broken when their romantic endeavors toward the CEO don’t work, or they get mentally stressed to the point they drop out faster than a bowling ball, battling the next year in therapy.

Ares King wasn’t called the devil CEO for nothing. You know that feeling when you’re constantly at the edge of the cliff? Well, that’s working for him, and it doesn’t sum it all up.

I had so much on my plate, and against all odds, I dealt with all the shit thrown at me. I worked for the devil for three fucking years. Therefore, I was given a nickname.

“Here she comes.”

“The devil’s secretary.”

*1*

“I don’t know if I should be amazed or disturbed.”

“Color me disturbed.”

“Working closely with Mr. King must be a major trauma load.”

“How does she do it?”

“You don’t think she’s—”

“Nahhh, doubt that. He certainly wouldn’t settle for someone like her.”

“True, he can date models, not a wash-up version.”

*Ouch.*

“She probably thinks she’s some kinda big shot pulling this off.”

“Maybe she just stayed, hoping for a chance with Ares King.”

“Don’t they all?”

“Not all can take that load. She’s definitely desperate.”

“Stooping so low for a chance, unbelieveable.”

“Shhh! She’s close!”

*Every. Single. Time.* I thought I’d get used to their gossip by now, but they always found a way to make it greatly *impactful.*

Nevertheless, I kept my posture, walking professionally as if their words never bothered me.

\~☆\~

I set the coffee on the table to grab the paper from the printer when the doors leading to my boss’s office open with force. A man stepped out, fury twisted on his face.

He snappily loosens his tie. “Fuck him! Fuck this company! Fuck you too!”

I frowned at him. “Sir, I’m gonna ask you to leave before I call security.”

“My entire project is in the mud, all because of one mistake!”

I was already dialing a number, and I made sure he could see me doing it. I’m accustomed to this display, and they sometimes get violent.

In a single day, dreams are crushed and careers are ruined. Not everyone can take that calmly.

“Your boss is evil!” He came towards me, and I took cautious steps back.

I’m still traumatized by when someone tossed a stapler at me and destroyed my desk.

Footsteps echoed, grasping our attention. Ares King emerged, spotless in his three-piece suit. Hair as dark as midnight and cold blue eyes that could freeze you over with one look.

“Is there a problem, Mr. Hayes?” he asked calmly.

I shivered at the lifeless tone.

“Y-You didn’t give me a chance. This is my life’s work. You can’t do this to me!”

“Chance is equivalent to a risk. I’m not risking millions of dollars on a failed project.”

*1*

“Failed project? It hasn’t even—”

“This discussion ended when I gave my final verdict.”

“You can’t just—”

“Do yourself a favor and leave before you lose something else other than your career.”

The threat hung in the air, and Mr. Hayes couldn’t tell if he was serious or making a light-hearted threat.

*1*

The security team was already here, and I sighed in relief. They dragged him out as he cried and appealed for a chance before following it up by cursing the King’s name.

That was the fifth one today, and the day wasn’t even over yet.

*2*

“Ms. Lane. I have a meeting in an hour. Is everything ready?”

*Crap!* I haven’t prepared for that. I was hoping to bring my letter early. *It’s not too late.*

I approached him, stretching my hand for him to take the coffee. “Um, Mr. King, I—”

He pinned me with those cold blue eyes, and I rephrased my words.

“E-Everything will be ready in a few minutes.” I fixed my usual fake smile.

He was back in his office, leaving me hanging. I checked my watch and saw his coffee order had exceeded fifteen minutes.

*Such a waste.*

I subconsciously drank from the cup and grimaced, sticking out my tongue.

That was not a wise move, given that he took his coffee black with no sugar.

“Yuck!”

\~☆\~

I ended up leaving the letter on his desk after he left the office. Not exactly what I had in mind, but it’d suffice. Ares King wouldn’t bat an eye when he sees it. All I care about is what comes after.

I pressed the keycard at the doorknob, and it opened with a soft click. I didn’t tell him I was coming, but I was hoping to stop by after having such a hectic day.

I struggled to take off my stilettos. This was the worst day to forget my flats, now my feet are all sore.

I flipped on the light switch. “You won’t believe the day I had. Don’t worry, I did it. Well, not as planned, but… It’s still a win.”

I dropped my bag, striding to the fridge for water, but I paused midway when I spotted an open bottle of champagne with two wine glasses.

*Did he have someone over?*

I cast a brief look around the apartment before bringing my gaze back to them. I narrowed my eyes when I caught a stain… *a red lipstick.*

“You’re so beautiful.”

*That was Dan’s voice*. It was coming from the room.

“You like that, don’t you, Danny? Like the way I ride your cock?”

Hey r/lucknow,I'm a 24M who hopped off the train for just one full day in your beautiful city before heading to a friend's wedding in Raebareli. Arrived on the 20th, left the next morning, but tried to squeeze in as many spots as possible. Buckle up – this is gonna be a long one!My adventure kicked off at Charbagh Railway Station around early morning. On the train, I ended up chatting with this friendly uncle about where we were headed – both said Lucknow, coincidence! There was also a couple where the lady was carrying Laddu Gopal (my first time seeing that – super interesting and new to me). When we pulled into Charbagh, the uncle mentioned he lived right there and there's a hotel next to his apartment. I don't trust strangers easily, but he seemed genuinely nice, so I followed him. He checked Hotel Yash for me (it was full), then got a staff to check Mohan Hotel. I told him not to worry, I'd find something, but they had rooms available.Ended up at Mohan Hotel – ₹1500 for single, ₹1800 for double deluxe. Checked a couple rooms: one with Indian toilet (small), then Room 419 on the 4th floor with Western (average, but honestly, skip this if you're planning – better options in Charbagh for the price). 24-hour checkout, checked in at 7:41 AM, had to leave same time next day.Staff took my luggage up, offered normal/Bisleri water (took normal). Asked for WiFi password, but signal didn't reach the room – said fine, I'd be out exploring anyway.Decided to freshen up and hit the city. Bathroom had no shower (just mug), no towel, only soap/moisturizer/shampoo. Called reception, they said check around or they'd send one. Waited 10 mins with TV on loud for songs – nothing. Called again, got a rude ""Bhaiya aa rhe hai, ruko thoda, chhotu ab tak aaya nahi hai"" – hung up annoyed. Towel finally showed up a minute later. Took a bath, got ready.Asked for laundry – they quoted ₹80 for T-shirt + pants, said it'd be ready by 12 PM next day. Needed it by 7 AM checkout, so skipped.Headed to Charbagh Metro towards Hazratganj for breakfast: Bajpayee Kachori Bhandar for kasta kachori – solid taste! (Spotted some pretty girls around too, lol). Then Shukla Tea Stall for chai and bun makkhan – bun was great, chai below average.Booked a bike rental and aimed for Gautam Buddha Park, but midway hit massive traffic – some college convention + police for a minister, I think. Park was closed till 11 AM anyway.Pivoted to Bada Imambara. Stopped at Rumi Darwaza for photos, explored the area. Ticket ₹50 – covered everything included. Loved it!Coming back, an autowala offered a ₹50 tour of nearby spots + shopping in Chowk, said he'd wait. Knew I'd end up spending, but went for it. Took me to a chikan factory – guy showed the process, offered lemon tea/chai/coffee. Bought kurtas/kurtis for myself, mom, and dad. He waited over an hour while I shopped, tipped him ₹100 extra.Then he took me to clock tower, pond, Chhota Imambara, picture gallery. Asked for nearby famous spots – suggested Gomti Nagar, Ambedkar Park, and Jogeshwari Park (I think he meant Janeshwar Mishra?).Wanted Ambedkar Park bad, so planned lunch first.Biggest annoyance: Guides everywhere! They latched on hard even after I said no. Ended up giving one ₹100, another ₹200. The second wanted more, but I said budget constraints – kept insisting, finally backed off.Clicked pics, then bike to Aminabad for Tunday Kababi. Ordered mutton galawati kebabs with paratha + chicken biryani – both absolutely amazing!Then to Dr. Ambedkar Memorial Park – spent almost 2.5 hours chilling and sightseeing. Beautiful spot.Wrapped up with Gomti Riverfront Park – checked out Food Valley (vibes full of GenZs). Grabbed some chaap, called friends to brag, then biked back to hotel. It was freezing cold – crashed hard as soon as I got in.Next morning: Checkout, straight to Raebareli for the wedding.Overall, had an absolute blast! Lucknow felt so heartwarming – the people (mostly), the history, the food. Thanks a ton for the awesome recommendations from that earlier thread!If I plan a longer trip next time, any additional must-visits? (I missed Residency, Zoo, Hazratganj proper shopping, etc.)

What pisses me off is my in-laws who hardly ever reaches out to me. They never even ask how my kids are—kahit sa kids nalang. We never really had a good relationship when the husband was still alive kasi sila yung type na mag giguilt trip sa husband ko coz he’s the eldest of 5 kids. His sister would always tell him obligasyon niya to shoulder the family’s problems kasi siya ang eldest and siya lang naka pag tapos ng school. That’s not an excuse coz hindi man ako naka pag tapos but I earn a decent amount of money.  

Shortly after my husband died, I really felt lonely. I bought two of his sisters cellphones so they would keep in touch with us. One of them only messages when they need something, like monetary help. Cut her off before, and she messaged my daughter bad mouthing me. I only messaged her again when their father got sick—and eventually passed away.  

Last year, at my husband’s third death anniversary, his eldest daughter (with an ex) went to their house and posted that her grandma made her coffee. That really triggered me. Buti pa siya binigyan ng coffee pero mga anak ko ni kumusta wala talaga! I confronted my sisters-in-law and told them that, but instead of acknowledging my feelings, they became defensive. I’m tired. One of my SILs keep making parinig her phone’s old na. I thought about buying her a new one since I still communicate with my MIL sometimes, but having second thoughts na rin and since mag 5 years na next year ang pagka wala ni husband, I thought about cutting them off for good. By the way, they live in Cagayan de Oro and the kids and I are in Cebu.",12,1766473196.0,OffMyChestPH,4,1.0,False

I’m looking to do a 2 or 3 night trip. I’ve always wanted to book a cabin in Muskoka but I’m not sure if the place is good in Apr or May. 

What options do I have that are:
1. Driving distance from Toronto (2-4 hours is reasonable). Open to take a flight as well if there are good options at a good price.
2. Cut off a bit from the typical Metropolitan life - want to disconnect a bit. Would love a place where we can walk around a new city and explore, find a nice coffee shop to sit, maybe some nature and parks for picnics, and ideally some halal places but that’s optional. 
3. Ideally not too expensive - looking at something which can be done within 1k in terms of accommodation and some eating out and exploring. We can drive ourselves so that wouldn’t factor into the costs. ",0,1766473196.0,ontario,1,0.5,False

My mind is calm and all the different layers of thoughts, music etc. are almost completely quiet, like they are far away. I can think of one thing after another, dont interrupt people etc. 

But at the same time my body almost feels a bit high. I wanna do aaaall the things I've been procrastinating cause I actually get some gratification from it for the first time??  My chest also feels a tiny bit fluttery like being excited or having a crush lol.

Is it because I'n not used to it? Or could 30mg be too much and I'm getting high from it?  

I only tried it for 3 days before where on the first two days I had the same reaction and the third day I almost felt sedated and only tired and almost depressed. But I also slept very little in those three days. 

Since then I stopped taking it for a few weeks but want to give it another chance. 

Today is the second day I'm trying again. I only slept 3,5 hours :(  but I had coffee at 3pm when I crashed, maybe thats the reason...?

The crash made me kinda sad, like when drugs stop working when partying. I really like the motivation and quiet brain. I don't want it to stop. 

Is that suspicious? Will I get addicted? 

Or could it be cause the difference is so noticeable to me? I really struggled with executive dysfunction in the last months and sometimes couldn't even shower for several days, let alone clean or go to the gym etc. 

Atm I take 20mg in the morning with a few tablespoons of greek yoghurt and try to eat some protein oats or a shake before noon. Thats when I take the remaining 10mg. 

I also take 18mg atomoxetine and 200mg lamotrigine in the morning. 
In the evening I take magbesium, omega 3+vitamin d, a vitamin b complex and Melatonin. Idc if thats relevant. 


I know that was a lot. Thank you to anyone that read this much. Any input or advice is appreciated. <3",2,1766473133.0,ADHD,8,1.0,False

Morning routine:
• Wake up confused because it’s cold, sunny, raining, and humid — all at once
• Check if your office is WFH or “please come, culture matters”
• Spend 45 mins traveling 6 km because Silk Board

Food scene as a bachelor in Bangalore:
• Monday: Dosa + filter coffee = life sorted
• Tuesday: Zomato because “too tired to cook”
• Wednesday: That one Andhra mess that saves you emotionally
• Thursday: “Healthy bowl” phase
• Friday: Biryani debate (Donne vs Hyderabadi)
• Weekend: Indiranagar / Koramangala — even if your wallet says no

House hunting trauma deserves its own subreddit:
• “Bachelor? Drinking? Non-veg?” interrogation round
• 2BHK rent = your CTC divided by sanity
• Deposit so high it feels like an EMI without a house

Social life:
You meet more people at office smoke breaks than family functions.
Friends leave Bangalore faster than startups shut down.
Dating apps? Everyone is “new to the city” since 2019.

I need to decide between these two. I'm looking at the 512 GB 16 GB ram configuration for both. I know a lot of people have asked this but I'm losing my mind trying to figure out which one's best for me. Here's the thing. I'm going to keep this thing for many years. It's going to be my only computer. Logic points to the 14 pro but that bigger screen is so tempting. 
I travel sometimes around the world, I sometimes go to coffee shops, I'm coming from a depressing 13 air from a decade ago...the Air would fit in my backpack but I'm not sure it's as durable as the pro.
The 15 Air just seems fun and unique and the 14 pro feels like the dependable safe choice. I do hobby photography and have a degree in it but I'm not doing anything heavy these days. An SD slot would be great but I already have a dongle...
I want the better sound and screen of the pro but the reality is I might never use it to it's full potential. I'm up in the air as far as career paths as well so I can't say I'll need a heavy machine but I also want this to last me over 5 years. 
For reference, I've had a 13-in MacBook Air.....from 2012 🫣 yes it's been awful and I hate how tiny it is but it's worked. Time to get something nice though.

**TACTICAL LOG: OPERATIONAL GROUP ""TRIDENT""** **Location:** S.L.A.M. Equatorial Platform Alpha (Indian Ocean) **Time:** April 25, 204X – 23:45 Local Time **Unit:** DEVGRU Red Squadron / Task Force 88 **Mission:** SEIZURE / HVT SECURE

The Indian Ocean was a flat, black mirror. To the naked eye, there was nothing but the dark horizon and the distant, towering lights of the Platform, rising like an oil rig on steroids.

But Lieutenant Commander Washington (callsign ""Viper"") wasn't looking with naked eyes. His panoramic NVGs painted the world in a crisp, white-phosphor monochrome.

""Alpha Team, status,"" he whispered into his bone-conduction mic.

""Alpha in position. Mag-locks engaged on the North Pylon. We are ghost,"" came the reply.

""Bravo, breaching the sub-sea maintenance hatch. Thirty seconds to interior.""

Viper checked his wrist display. The operation was textbook. The USS *Virginia* had dropped them five miles out, running silent. Their delivery vehicles—advanced swimmer delivery sleds—had brought them right up to the massive composite legs of the Space Elevator's base station. They had bypassed three sonar nets and a thermal curtain.

The S.L.A.M. security was a joke. Automated patrols, yes, but predictable. Civilian-grade. Reid might be a genius physicist, but he clearly didn't know a damn thing about perimeter defense.

""Command, this is Viper. Outer perimeter breached. No resistance. Proceeding to the Control Center to secure the hard-line.""

""Copy Viper. The President wants that elevator locked down before the morning news cycle. Green light on all targets of opportunity. If it resists, frag it.""

The team reached the nearest mooring of the harbor to the space elevator, moving in the shadow of a gigantic container ship that was disgorging containers onto the floating platform at breakneck speed.

The harbor was a void. Beyond the harsh floodlights bathing the container ship, the darkness was absolute—a light-swallowing black that even the panoramic NVGs struggled to penetrate. Washington signaled for a perimeter check, moving low against the damp steel.

Then, the air itself seemed to tighten.

It wasn't a sound. It was a physical pressure that hit them in the chest, rhythmic and crushing. *Thrum.* The Ascendant was firing. Every sixty seconds, a hundred-ton cargo pod was punched into the sky, riding a wave of electromagnetic force so dense it tasted like copper on the tongue.

Washington’s headset didn't just go dead; it screamed. A high-pitched squeal of overloaded circuits tore through the bone-conduction loop before silencing instantly. His HUD flickered—vital signs, maps, objectives—then dissolved into grey snow.

He tapped his helmet. Dead. He looked at Alpha Two. The operator was frantically tapping his wrist comp, shaking his head. The Intel boys had prepped them for RF jamming, but not for this—a brute-force magnetic pulse occurring every minute.

Ten minutes in, and they were deaf, dumb, and blind to Command. Washington sliced a hand across his throat: *Comms cut.* He raised two fingers, then pointed to eyes. *Visuals only. We go dark.*

In the suffocating darkness, spatial orientation disintegrated. The only anchor was the distant, throbbing light of the Elevator shaft, miles away across the platform. Washington moved by instinct, guided by the faint phosphorescence of the salt spray.

Then, the air pressure dropped.

It wasn't a wind; it was a displacement. A massive, invisible wall of force *whooshed* past them, inches from Washington's shoulder. It was silent—terrifyingly so. No engine roar, no friction scream. Just the terrifying sensation of immense mass moving at speed.

Then another. *Whoosh.*

Then another.

The containers. The ship was unloading them, and they were gliding autonomously toward the elevator on unseen magnetic rails, cutting through the darkness like silent trains.

""Hold! Freeze!"" Washington roared, forgetting silence discipline, his voice cracking with sudden, primal fear.

He spun around to check his six, his NVGs scanning the line. ""Sound off! Count off!""

Silence.

""Alpha Two? Alpha Three?""

Nothing.

Washington grabbed the shoulder of the man behind him—Alpha Five. The man was shaking, pointing a trembling finger into the dark.

Washington looked.

A split second of illumination from a passing strobe caught the next container gliding past. It was a standard ISO unit, forty feet of steel weighing a hundred tons. But the front face wasn't smooth grey metal.

It was wet.

Smeared across the impact plate of the silent juggernaut was a horrific, unrecognizable paste of crushed ceramic armor, night-vision optics, and organic matter. Red pulp.

Three men. Gone. Erased in a second by a silent, indifferent logistic algorithm that didn't even register a collision.

Washington forced the panic down, shoving it into a dark corner of his mind. He couldn't scream. He couldn't mourn. He could only command.

""Move,"" he signaled, his hand shaking slightly before clenching into a fist. ""We finish this.""

They advanced into the belly of the machine. It was a harrowing, terrifying trudge through a valley of death where the reapers were silent algorithms and invisible magnetic fields.

They lost two more men at the primary rail junction—caught in the slipstream of a high-speed loader that moved faster than human reflexes could register. One second they were there; the next, a red mist hung in the humid air.

Nine became seven.

Then, the drones returned. Not the welders this time, but heavy lifters, indifferent to the soft biological obstacles in their path. Alpha Six was crushed against a pylon. Alpha Eight was swept over the edge into the black ocean below.

Seven became four.

But they didn't break. The terror that should have paralyzed them was forged into a grim, unbreakable resolve. They were the tip of the spear, and the spear does not stop until it strikes or shatters. They moved with a mechanical precision born of desperation, vaulting over coolant pipes, dodging the rhythmic pistons of the auto-loaders.

They reached the final maintenance gantry. Lungs burning, muscles screaming, the four survivors clawed their way up the slick durasteel ladder.

Washington crested the ridge first. He raised his weapon, scanning the platform.

There.

Two hundred meters ahead, suspended like a spider's nest in the center of the magnetic web, sat the target. The Control Center. The brain of the beast.

**THE WHITE HOUSE – SITUATION ROOM** **Time: 00:15 EST**

""We lost the feed,"" General Vance said, slamming his fist on the table. ""All telemetry from Trident is gone.""

""Did they secure the asset?"" President Whitmore asked, sweating.

""We don't know. The last transmission was... confused. They reported the structure was attacking them.""

“They are highly trained Mr President, even without communications, they will follow through”

“Ok, Admiral, where is our carrier fleet?”

""Carrier Strike Group Five is holding station at rendezvous point Zulu. They are sanitizing the airspace over **Pulau Lingga** as we speak. Birds are on the deck, sir. They launch on your mark.""

Director Cohen didn't speak. He just stared at his tablet, his face draining of color. He didn't ask for permission; he swiped a finger across the glass, casting his feed to the main display.

""Sir. You need to see this. It just hit the AP wire.""

The screen lit up with a breaking news alert, flashing in urgent red.

**FLASH // URGENT: ENTIRE CREW OF USS VIRGINIA RECOVERED BY CHINESE CONTAINER SHIP 'OCEAN PRIDE' 20NM SOUTH OF SLAM PLATFORM. CAPTAIN REPORTS SUBMARINE SUFFERED CATASTROPHIC POWER FAILURE AND FORCED SURFACING. NO CASUALTIES.**

The silence in the room wasn't just heavy; it was absolute. It was the sound of a superpower realizing it was bleeding.

Admiral Blackwood slowly lowered himself into his chair, his eyes wide. ""The *Virginia*... is a Block V fast-attack boat. It doesn't just... fail.""

""He didn't just blind them,"" Cohen whispered, looking at the President with dawning horror. ""He just sank their ride home. Trident is stranded, sir. They are on that rock alone.""

""Get me Admiral Sterling,"" Whitmore commanded, his voice tight. ""I need to know we still have teeth.""

The main screen shifted. The seal of the US Navy flashed, replaced by the live feed from the flag bridge of the USS *Gerald R. Ford*.

Admiral Sterling stood in the center of the frame, the very image of American naval supremacy. Behind him, the bridge was a hive of disciplined, quiet activity. Through the blast windows, the night was pitch black, punctuated only by the red and green running lights of the F-35s on the catapults.

""Mr. President,"" Sterling said, his voice calm, cutting through the static. ""Strike Group Five is Green. We are holding station. The airspace is sanitized. We are ready to rain hell on your command. Launch in T-minus two minutes.""

""Do it, Admiral. Clear the board.""

""Aye, sir. All stations, this is Flag. Initiate—""

The Admiral didn't finish the sentence.

It didn't start with a bang. It started with a *click*. The sound of a thousand magnetic locks engaging simultaneously across the length of the thousand-foot vessel.

Then came the scream.

*WHOOP. WHOOP. WHOOP.*

The bridge lighting died, replaced instantly by the sickly, rotating amber of the NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) alarm.

""Radiological warning!"" the Tactical Action Officer shrieked, his face bathed in the yellow light. ""Sensors detect a catastrophic core breach in Reactor Two! Lethal levels!""

""Scram the pile!"" Sterling roared. ""Dump the rods!""

""I can't!"" The Engineering officer was hammering his console, panic rising in his voice. ""The system has initiated 'Protocol Omega'. It's a containment lockdown. Sir... the blast doors.""

On the main monitor, the internal CCTV feeds popped up. They showed heavily armored watertight doors slamming shut in corridors, mess halls, and engine rooms. Sailors were banging on the thick steel, their faces twisted in confusion that was rapidly turning to terror.

""They're sealed in,"" the XO whispered. ""The whole engineering watch... they're trapped in the containment zone.""

""Override!"" Sterling commanded. ""Send a team to manual control!""

""We can't, sir! The bulkheads are locked! The ship thinks we're leaking radiation everywhere! It quarantined the propulsion section!""

Then, the floor tilted.

""Helm!""

""She's not answering, Admiral!"" The helmsman was fighting the wheel, veins bulging in his neck, but the heavy controls were dead. ""Rudder is locked hard over! 15 degrees starboard!""

A deep, guttural vibration shuddered through the deck plates. The engines.

""Turbines are spooling up,"" the helmsman cried out, looking at the RPM gauges climbing into the red. ""We are going to Flank Speed! She's running away with us!""

In the White House, the silence was broken by the terrified voice of a superpower losing its grip.

""Where is she going?"" Whitmore demanded. ""Blackwood, give me a vector!""

Admiral Blackwood stared at the tactical plot. The blue icon of the *Gerald R. Ford* was tracing a straight, accelerating line. It wasn't heading for the open ocean.

It was heading for the rocky shoreline of **Pulau Lingga**.

""It's a mutiny,"" Vance whispered, staring at the screen. ""But it is the ship mutinying.""

""He's not stealing the ship,"" Blackwood said, his voice cracking. ""He's executing it.""

On the screen, the coastline was visible now through the bridge windows—a dark mass rushing closer at terrified speed.

""Impact in ninety seconds,"" Blackwood stated, closing his eyes. ""He is driving a hundred thousand tons of nuclear-powered steel directly into the island at flank speed. He's going to crash her, sir. He's going to break her back.""

""Impact,"" the tactical officer whispered.

The blue icon merged with the landmass. The telemetry feed flatlined. The *Gerald R. Ford*, the pride of the fleet, was gone—wrecked on the shores of an Indonesian island by its own brain.

The room held its breath, waiting for the scream, the outburst, the grief.

It never came.

President Whitmore didn't flinch. He didn't look away. He stared at the dead screen for a single heartbeat, his face a mask of terrifying, frozen calculation. Then, he turned.

""Get me the Second Fleet,"" he commanded, his voice devoid of tremor.

""Sir?"" Vance blinked, still processing the catastrophe. ""The *Ford* just—""

""The *Ford* is a sunk cost, General,"" Whitmore cut him off, ice in his tone. ""We have a war to win. Get me Admiral Lasky on the *Enterprise*. They are holding in the North Atlantic. If we can't hit him from the Pacific, we burn him from the roof of the world.""

""Connecting,"" the comms officer said, his hands shaking.

The main screen flickered. The static cleared to reveal the bridge of the USS *Enterprise* (CVN-80). But the scene wasn't the orderly command center Whitmore expected. Smoke hung in the air. Technicians were running with fire extinguishers.

Admiral Lasky stepped into the frame. He was covered in soot. He didn't salute.

""Mr. President,"" Lasky coughed. ""I assume you're calling for a strike package.""

""Launch everything, Admiral,"" Whitmore ordered. ""Full spread. Target the Tether.""

""We can't, sir,"" Lasky said flatly.

Whitmore’s eyes narrowed. ""Refusal of orders is treason, Admiral.""

""It's not refusal, sir. It's capability."" Lasky stepped aside, pointing through the blast glass to the flight deck.

It was a graveyard of ambition. A squadron of F-35s sat paralyzed on the deck. But the catapults... the tracks weren't straight lines of steel. They were warped, glowing cherry-red in the twilight.

""The EMALS,"" Lasky spat the acronym like a curse. ""The electromagnetic launch system. Five minutes ago, we experienced a power surge. It didn't trip the breakers. It melted the coils. The magnetic catapults are fused solid, Mr. President. We can't launch a paper airplane, let alone a fighter.""

He turned back to the camera.

""And the weapons elevators are seized between decks. The command circuits are fried. We are a hundred-thousand-ton floating hotel, sir. I have issued the order to come about. We are limping back to Norfolk for repairs.""

The feed cut out.

Whitmore stood in the center of the ruin of American power. The Pacific Fleet was wrecked. The Atlantic Fleet was castrated. The Trident team was silent.

Reid hadn't just defeated the United States military. He had dismantled it, piece by piece, from his living room.

Whitmore didn't scream. He didn't rage. He simply turned his back on the screens showing the smoking ruins of his conventional power and looked at the single, isolated monitor on the far wall.

It displayed a high-altitude vector map of the Western Pacific. The ocean was black. The land was green. And crawling across the stratosphere, sixty thousand feet above the chaos, were two solitary white pixels.

Ghost 1 and Ghost 2.

B-21 Raiders. The unseen blade. They had been loitering for six hours, running silent, waiting for the order that no President ever wanted to give. But the fleets were gone. The blockade was broken. The world was watching the United States bleed.

Whitmore looked at those two dots. They were the only thing left that couldn't be hacked, couldn't be stopped by a clever algorithm. Physics still worked. A falling star still burned.

The room went cold. The air conditioning hummed, sounding like a roar in the sudden, suffocating silence. Every general, every aide, every analyst knew what was coming. They stopped breathing.

Whitmore extended his hand, palm up. His voice was a whisper, but it carried the weight of the end of the world.

""The Football.""

The military aide, a young Major whose face had gone ash-grey, stepped forward with the heavy black briefcase. He placed it on the table. The click of the latches opening sounded like gunshots.

Whitmore took the laminated card—the ""Biscuit""—from his pocket. He snapped it open.

""General Vance,"" Whitmore said, his eyes dead. ""Authenticate.""

""Sierra. Tango. Nine. Victor. Alpha,"" Vance recited, his voice shaking.

""Authentication confirmed,"" Whitmore said. He punched the sequence into the comms link. ""This is National Command Authority. Flash Traffic to Ghost Flight. Reference Plan Omega.""

He looked at the two white dots.

""Release the package.""

The room waited for the confirmation code. The 'Weapons Away' signal that would mark the point of no return.

It never came.

Instead, the two white pixels simply vanished.

""Lost contact!"" the comms officer shouted, his voice cracking. ""Ghost Flight has dropped off the net!""

""Did they drop the payload?"" Whitmore demanded, leaning over the table. ""Did they release?""

""No confirmation! Transponders are dead!""

The room erupted. Generals were shouting into phones that were dead or jammed. Analysts were frantically rebooting consoles. It was pandemonium—the blind panic of men who had pulled a trigger and didn't know where the bullet had gone.

""Mr. President!""

The shout came from a young intelligence aide in the back corner. He wasn't looking at the main screen. He was looking at a raw feed from a weather satellite on his laptop. He looked sick.

""Put it on the main,"" Whitmore whispered.

The screen flickered. The vector map of the Pacific disappeared. In its place appeared a satellite overlay of the Asian continent.

Two faint, pulsing distress beacons were blinking. But they weren't over the Indian Ocean. They weren't even close to the Space Elevator.

They were deep inside the People's Republic of China.

""They're not over the target,"" Vance breathed, his legs giving out. ""My God. Where are they?""

""Sichuan Province,"" the aide said, his voice trembling. ""Sir, we just received a burst transmission from Ghost One via emergency low-band. Their navigation systems... they were compromised four hours ago. They thought they were on an attack vector south of India.""

""They've been flying over China for four hours?"" Whitmore gripped the table, his knuckles white. ""With live nuclear warheads?""

""It gets worse,"" the aide whispered.

On the screen, new icons appeared around the distress signals. Red icons.

""Ghost Leader reports visual contact,"" the aide read from the scrolling text, tears streaming down his face. ""Six PLAAF J-20 Mighty Dragons. They have lock-on. They are forcing them to land at Chengdu Air Base.""

Whitmore closed his eyes. The nuclear bombers hadn't been stopped. They had been delivered—hand-delivered—to the United States' greatest rival, complete with their payloads and their encryption keys.

Reid hadn't just disarmed them. He had framed them for an act of war he knew they couldn't win.

**THE FINAL BLOW**

The silence in the Situation Room was broken by the chirping of a notification. Not a red alert. Not a nuclear warning. Just a standard media monitoring alert.

""Sir,"" the press secretary whispered, looking at her phone as if it were an alien artifact. ""CNN is live from Singapore. You need to see this.""

Whitmore looked up from the abyss of his defeat. ""Put it on.""

The main screen, which had just displayed the end of American hegemony, flickered. The terrifying red icons of the compromised bombers vanished.

In their place was blinding, high-definition sunlight.

The shot was aerial, swooping down over the iconic rooftop infinity pool of the Marina Bay Sands. The water was a dazzling turquoise, merging seamlessly with the skyline of a city that looked like it had been scrubbed clean of all the world's dirt.

There, at a private table under a white parasol, sat the man who had just dismantled the US Navy and hijacked its nuclear arsenal.

Georges Reid was wearing a linen shirt, unbuttoned at the collar. He was buttering a croissant. Opposite him, Clarissa Tang—the woman the intelligence reports called the ""White Widow""—was laughing at something he had just said, looking radiant and utterly unbothered.

Below them, on the public observation deck, a crowd of thousands was cheering, waving flags with the S.L.A.M. logo. They weren't screaming in terror. They were cheering in adoration.

Reid looked up, shielding his eyes from the sun. He spotted the news drone. He didn't hide. He didn't look like a Bond villain plotting in a bunker.

He smiled. A genuine, relaxed, devastatingly charming smile. He raised his coffee cup in a lazy, negligent toast to the camera, then turned back to his breakfast.

The news chyron scrolled across the bottom of the screen in cheerful blue and white:

**LIVE: BILLIONAIRE 'SAVIOR' SPOTTED ENJOYING SUNDAY BRUNCH. WITNESSES CONFIRM REID HAS BEEN POOLSIDE WITH FRIENDS FOR PAST 4 HOURS.**

The reporter’s voiceover was breathless, almost giddy. *""When asked about the rumors of naval maneuvers in the Indian Ocean, Mr. Reid simply laughed and quoted Shakespeare: 'Much ado about nothing.' He then ordered another round of mimosas for his table.""*

In the dark, windowless tomb of the Situation Room, President Whitmore watched the man who had just ended his presidency eat a pastry in the sun. The contrast was a physical blow. The sweat on Whitmore's back felt cold. The air in the room tasted of stale coffee and fear.

On the screen, Reid was bathed in light, untouchable, eating breakfast while the world burned around him, and that world loved him for it.

Whitmore slowly sat down.

""He was there the whole time,"" Vance whispered, the realization shattering him. ""He didn't even need to be in the room to beat us. He did it on autopilot.""

Whitmore didn't answer. He just watched the screen, where the God Emperor of the new world was wiping a crumb from his lip, having breakfast on top of the world.

**THE FATE OF TRIDENT**

The four remaining survivors of Red Squadron stacked up on the heavy blast door of the Control Center. Washington checked his weapon. He was bleeding from the ears, his vision blurred, but the mission was all that mattered.

He held up three fingers. Two. One.

*Breach.*

The strip charge blew the locking mechanism. A flashbang canister was tossed inside, turning the world white with a deafening *CRACK-THUMP*.

They flowed into the room like water, weapons snapping to corners, voices screaming the commands they had practiced a thousand times.

""US Military! Get down! Hands on your heads!""

""Clear left!""

""Clear right!""

""Status!""

Washington stood in the center of the room, his rifle raised. The ringing in his ears faded, replaced by the hum of cooling fans.

There was no one to arrest.

The room was pristine. No chairs. No coffee cups. No panic. Just rows of fake plastic server racks with blinking Christmas lights humming in the dark, and a single whiteboard in the center of the room.

It wasn't a command center. It was just a trap.

Washington walked to the whiteboard. A single message was hand-written in black marker:

**GAME OVER.**

*KA-CHUNK.*

The sound came from behind them. The blast door they had just breached slammed shut, driven by hydraulic rams that crushed the twisted metal of the lock like paper. Magnetic seals engaged with a hiss of finality.

""Door's sealed!"" Alpha Five yelled, throwing his shoulder against it. ""It won't budge!""

Then, the floor dropped.

The entire room lurched violently, knocking them off their feet. A massive mechanical *THUD* reverberated through the walls as heavy locking pins engaged on the exterior.

Gravity shifted. The room tilted forty-five degrees.

""We're moving!"" Washington screamed, grabbing a server rack for support. ""The whole damn building is moving!""

It wasn't a building.

Outside, in the dark, the ""Control Center"" module detached from its moorings. Enormous magnetic clamps seized it, lifting the two-ton structure and sliding it seamlessly onto the magnetic rail of the Ascendant.

Inside, the survivors of the world's most elite special forces unit were helpless as the G-forces hit them. They weren't soldiers anymore. They were cargo.

The module accelerated, rocketing upward into the night sky, carrying the last of the President's men toward a prison in high earth orbit.

Checkmate.

They were released a week after without a single word in the middle of Singapore, in a paper prison uniform, in the afternoon equatorial shower. They walked to the US Embassy, where the Press was waiting to eat them alive.

33-year-old Army vet here in Oregon, 6'3, finally in a good spot after all the moving around. Life's taught me a lot, and now I'm just looking for someone cool to connect with—good conversation, laughs, maybe grab coffee or go for a hike and see where it goes.



About me: I've got wonderful sense of humor , I like staying active with workouts, exploring the outdoors (Oregon's too beautiful not to), cooking random meals, and chilling with music or a good book.



Hoping to meet someone kind, fun, and down-to-earth who wants to start chatting and take it from there. No rush, just genuine vibes.



If you're around Oregon, hit me up—tell me your go-to coffee spot or the last thing that made you laugh out loud.



Looking forward to hearing from you! 😊

I used to eat horribly, all fried foods, heavy carbs, the whole 9. Recently I’ve changed my diet eating high protein and almost completely cut fried foods out of my diet, began walking 2 miles a day, and started using sugar free syrups for my daily coffee, began taking berberine daily as well as taking ginger shots/drinks daily. I’ve been off of my daily 2 mi walks for about a month and half but have maintained the changed diet usually eating only once a day, still do not drink, but vape heavily. Within the last couple weeks, I’ve noticed my watches and bracelets have become very loose, I lose hair(very small amounts anytime I shower, and my bowel movements have also experienced some changes. I’ve noticed I’m not as hungry, but even when I do eat a lot, it doesn’t feel like I’m expelling the amount of what I ate. Very small amounts. I’ve been told ginger and berberine can contribute to loss of appetite but with everything going on, I’m concerned. The only weight loss I have noticed is the thinning of my wrists but the weight on the scale has only changed 2-3 lbs. Am I freaking out over nothing or is the change in wrist size a cause for concern for a bigger issue? I suppose I’m worried because I took a break in my daily exercise.

1ptn5h6,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1ptn5h6/my_girlfriend_left_me_because_i_was_a_loser_4/,"My girlfriend left me because I was a loser, 4 months later I’m unrecognizable :)","
Four months ago my girlfriend of 3 years left me and told me i was going nowhere with my life. She was right and it destroyed me.

I’m 25 now but back then i was working at a call center making $15/hour, living in a shitty studio apartment, playing video games every night until 3am. Had been doing this for 2 years straight with zero ambition to change anything.

For privacy reasons we’ll call her Sarah. Now, Sarah and i had been together since college. She graduated, got a real job at a marketing firm, started building an actual career. I dropped out junior year and just… stopped trying. Got the call center job because it was easy and remote. Told myself i was “figuring things out” but really i was just comfortable being mediocre.

She tried to push me for years. Asked when i was gonna look for better jobs. Asked why i gamed every single night instead of doing anything productive. Asked if i even had goals anymore. I’d always say yeah i’m working on it, i’ll figure it out soon. Never did.

# What broke me.

We were supposed to go to her company dinner. Some fancy thing where all her coworkers brought their partners. I said i’d go but the day of i just didn’t feel like it. Told her i wasn’t feeling well and she should go without me.

She came back around 11pm and i was in the middle of a ranked valorant game. Didn’t even try and pay any attention to her when she walked in. Just said ‘hey how was it” while still playing.

She stood there watching me for like a minute. Then she said “I can’t do this anymore”

I paused the game and looked at her. She had tears in her eyes and said “you’re 25 years old and you’re going nowhere. You work a dead end job you hate, you play games every night, you have no ambition, no goals, nothing. I can’t watch you waste your life anymore.”

I tried to argue but she kept going. “everyone at dinner tonight asked about you. Asked what you do, where you work, what your plans are. And i had nothing to say. Because you’re not doing anything. You’re just… existing.”

“I love you but i can’t be with someone who’s given up on themselves. I need a partner who’s actually trying to build something. And you’re not that person anymore.”

She packed a bag that night and left. Moved back in with her parents. Broke up with me over text two days later saying she needed a clean break.

**Rock bottom**

The first week after she left i barely functioned. Called in sick to work for 3 days. Just laid in bed or played games. Ordered food, let trash pile up, didn’t even bother to shower

My apartment still had her stuff everywhere. Her shampoo in the bathroom, her hoodies i used to wear, photos of us on the wall. Every time i looked around i felt like shit.

The worst part was knowing she was completely right about everything. I was going nowhere. I had given up. I was wasting my life and dragging her down with me.

Week two i tried to text her saying i’d change, i’d get a better job, i’d be different. She responded once and said “i’ve heard this before. I hope you do change but i can’t wait around for it anymore.”

I was desperate. That response destroyed me more than the breakup itself. Because she was right. I’d been saying i’d change for years and never did. Why would she believe me now.

I realized i’d lost the best thing in my life because i was too comfortable being a loser. And if i didn’t actually change i’d just keep losing everything.

**Week 1-2 (desperate mode)**

First thing i did was start applying to jobs. Real jobs, not just call centers. Had to keep working my current job because i needed money for rent and couldn’t afford to just quit with nothing lined up.

Started applying to everything. Sales positions, account management, marketing coordinator roles, anything entry level that paid more than $15/hour. Didn’t matter if i was qualified or not, i just applied.

Applied to like 50 companies the first week. Most were jobs i had no business applying to. Saw requirements like “3-5 years experience” and applied anyway because i was desperate.

Got auto rejected from probably 40 of them within days. The rest just never responded. Felt like shit every time i got a rejection email but kept applying.

Also tried to change my routine. Deleted League and Valorant from my pc. Uninstalled every game on my phone. Set my alarm for 8am instead of letting myself sleep till noon.

But i had no structure. Would wake up at 8am, work my call center shift, then just waste the evening scrolling reddit or watching youtube. By the end of week 2 i felt like i was already failing.

Still applying to jobs every single day though. Started applying to 10-15 per day. Literally anything that seemed even remotely better than where i was.

**Finding structure (week 3)**

I was on some self improvement subreddit at like 1am looking for advice and found people talking about this app that helps you build structured plans. It was called Reload

Downloaded it expecting nothing but figured i’d try. It asked questions about where i was in life. What time do you wake up? How often do you work out? What are your goals?

Then it built this 60 day plan customized to my starting point. Week 1 was simple goals. Wake up at 9am, workout for 20min three times, apply to 5 jobs daily, spend 30min learning a new skill. Each day had tasks to complete.

The thing that really helped was it blocks distracting apps and sites during certain hours. Set it to block youtube, reddit, twitter from 9am to 6pm and after 10pm. When you try to open them it just shows a message to stay focused.

Sounds simple but that blocking actually worked. Because i’d try to open youtube out of habit and couldn’t and then i’d be forced to do something productive instead.

Also started noticing other people in the app community going through similar stuff. Guys who got dumped, lost jobs, hit rock bottom. Reading their posts about pushing through helped me not feel so alone

**Week 4-10 (the grind)**

By week 4 my routine was solid despite still working the call center job. Wake up 8am, workout 30min before work, work my shift 10am-6pm, apply to jobs and try to learn new skills till 9pm, read at night, bed by 11pm.

The plan increased difficulty gradually each week. Week 1 was 20min workouts, week 4 was 40min, week 7 was 60min. My body adapted to each increase before the next one came.

Still getting rejected from almost every job i applied to. Week 5 i got my first interview. Sales development rep at a saas company. Studied for it like it was a final exam. Felt like it went well. Got ghosted lol 

That rejection hit hard but the community in the app kept me going. Posted about it and got hella messages saying keep pushing, took them months to get hired, one yes is all you need.

Week 6 got 2 more interviews. Both rejections. Week 7 got 4 interviews, 3 rejections, one moved me to second round then rejected me there.

Started feeling hopeless. Been applying for 2 months straight, probably sent 300+ applications at this point. Working the same call center job i hated while trying to build a better life.

Week 8 got another interview. SDR at a marketing software company. Went through three rounds of interviews over two weeks. They said they’d let me know by end of week 10.

Week 10 they called with an offer. $45k base plus commission. Triple what i was making at the call center.

Put in my two weeks that day. Those last two weeks at the call center knowing i was leaving felt incredible.

**Week 11-16 (transformation)**

Started the new job week 11. First real job with actual career growth potential. Was terrified i’d fuck it up and prove everyone right that i was a loser.

The job was intense but in a good way. Actually had to learn things, hit metrics, work with a team. Came home tired but satisfied instead of just drained and empty.

First month i was barely hitting quota. Second month i exceeded it. Started making real commission checks on top of base salary. First one was $600, felt insane.

By week 12 i was in way better shape too. Lost like 18 pounds from working out consistently. Had more energy than i’d had in years. Brain fog was completely gone.

Used my increased income to get a better apartment. One bedroom in a nicer area, $200 more per month but i could actually afford it now. Moving out of the place i shared with Sarah felt like closing that chapter finally.

The app kept me on track the whole time. Daily tasks, gradual increases, the community support when i had bad days. Having external structure made it way easier than trying to rely on willpower alone.

Week 15 i ran into one of Sarah’s friends at the grocery store. She did a double take and said “holy shit is that you?” Said i looked completely different, asked what i’d been doing. Told her just working on myself.

She texted Sarah apparently because that night Sarah texted me. First time in months. Just said “Jess said she saw you. Said you look really good. I’m happy you’re doing well.”

I didn’t respond. Not because i was mad but because i realized i didn’t need her validation anymore. I wasn’t changing to get her back. I was changing because i was tired of being that person.

**Where i am now (month 4)**

It’s been 4 months since the breakup. I’m genuinely unrecognizable compared to who i was then.

**Job:** call center $15/hr -> SDR $45k base + commission (making like $58k with commission)

**Living situation:** shitty studio -> nice 1 bedroom in good area

**Physical:** lost 22 pounds, work out 5-6 times a week, actually have muscle definition

**Routine:** wake up 6:30am, workout, work, cook dinner, read or learn skills, bed by 10:30pm

**Mental state:** depressed and directionless -> actually have goals and confidence

The person i was 4 months ago wouldn’t recognize me. Hell i barely recognize myself sometimes. Wake up in my new apartment, go to my real job, look in the mirror and see someone who actually has their shit together.

Sarah reached out again 2 weeks ago. Said she heard through mutual friends that i got a new job and place. Asked if i wanted to get coffee and catch up.

Part of me wanted to say yes just to show her how different i am now. But i said no. Told her i appreciated her reaching out but i’m focused on myself right now.

Because the truth is i didn’t change to win her back. I changed because hitting rock bottom and losing her made me realize i was wasting my life. And i was tired of being someone even i didn’t respect.

**What actually worked**

Can’t lie, willpower alone wouldn’t have done it. Tried that for years and stayed stuck. Needed external systems that forced me to change even when i didn’t feel like it.

The app i mentioned (Reload) was honestly the biggest factor. Having a structured 60 day plan that started where i actually was and increased gradually. Having distractions blocked during work hours. Having daily tasks that made progress feel tangible.

The community in it helped too. Seeing other guys going through breakups and job losses and still pushing forward. Posting about my struggles and getting support instead of judgment. When i was getting rejected from every job for weeks, reading posts from guys who went through the same thing and eventually got hired kept me going.

Also replacing the gaming habit was crucial. Couldn’t just remove gaming and do nothing. Had to fill those hours with working out, job applications, learning skills, reading. Give my brain better dopamine sources.

Tracking progress helped a lot. The app tracked everything automatically which let me see improvement even on days it didn’t feel like i was making progress. Streak counters, completion rates, all that.

Starting smaller than i thought i needed to was key. Week 1 goals felt almost too easy. But building gradually meant i never got overwhelmed and quit like every other time i tried to change.


**If you’re in a shit position right now**

Or if your life is just fucked in general and you know you need to change, i get it. That feeling of being stuck and knowing you’re wasting time but not knowing how to fix it is brutal.

Maybe nobody left you but you’re still in the same spot i was. Dead end job, no direction, watching everyone else move forward while you’re stuck. Knowing you need to change but every attempt fails after a few days.

Use whatever pain you’re feeling as fuel. Being stuck and miserable is worse than the discomfort of changing. You already feel like shit, might as well feel like shit while building something better.

Don’t wait for some perfect moment or rock bottom wake up call. I had to lose the best thing in my life to finally change. Don’t wait until you lose something important. Start now while you still have what you have.

Get structure. Plans your days, block your distractions, keep yourself accountable. Willpower fails, systems work.

Start way smaller than you think you need to. If you’re waking up at noon don’t try to wake up at 6am tomorrow. Try 10am and build from there.

Replace bad habits with good ones instead of just removing them. Can’t just stop gaming or scrolling, need to fill that time with workouts, skills, reading, whatever.

Apply to way more jobs than feels reasonable if you’re trying to escape your current one. Most will reject you. That’s normal. Keep applying anyway. Took me 400+ applications to get one offer.

Track everything. Seeing progress in numbers helps on days when you feel like nothing’s changing.

Join communities of people doing the same thing. Having others who understand helps more than you’d think.

Accept you’ll have bad days. I had plenty. Days i slept in, skipped workouts, wasted time. Didn’t let those days turn into bad weeks.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

I used Reload to help me with all of this since it made everything so easy, if it wasn’t for it. I don’t know where i would be rn.

**The honest truth**

Four months ago my girlfriend left me because i was a 25 year old loser working a dead end job playing games every night with no goals or future. She was completely right.

Today i’m 25 with a real career making almost 4x what i made before. Living in a nice apartment. In the best shape of my life. Actually have goals and plans. Don’t hate myself when i look in the mirror.

She reached out wanting to reconnect and i said no. Not because i’m bitter but because i’m not the same person she left. And i don’t need her back to validate that.

The breakup destroyed me. But it also woke me up. Sometimes you need to lose everything to realize you’ve been wasting everything.

Four months is nothing. Four months from now you could be completely different. Or you could still be the same person just older and more bitter.

Your ex left because the old you wasn’t enough. Become someone who would be. Not for them. For you.

Start today. Get structure, remove distractions, build gradually, don’t quit when you have bad days.

The person you are now doesn’t have to be the person you are 4 months from now.

1ptn4vd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ptn4vd,Tiles now stiles,"I really didn’t mean to buy this van. But I’m glad I did. At first I was like damn, probably shoulda checked where it was. And how many miles it had on it. Stuff like that before getting all slap happy on eBay. But no. Didn’t do those things. 

Instead just put up a ridiculously low bid and before you know it I’ve got 2 weeks to pick up a van that has 222k+ miles on it. And I have to wire the money and send a copy of my ID before anyone will tell me where the van is or how to pick it up? Sounds totally legit. 

So I cut the check and some dude in Arkansas tells me the van is outside of San Fran. I live outside of Denver. The pieces are falling perfectly into place. Whatever. I’ve already sent the money. I’m down to make this happen.

Logistics… Fly out of Denver to San Fran. Take BART from the airport to the very end of the line in Antioch. Grab an Uber out to the shipyards the dude from Arkansas told me about where it looks like I might be about to get murdered and buried behind the silo. 

The nice lady in the red container that was an office disguised like all the other red containers in the murder shipyard was very helpful once I found her. Totally easy to find BTW. She had a copy of what looked like my eBay receipt and a key that said Tiles on it. Handed it over and turned me loose. Told me to punch the alarm button until I figured it out. Cool! No title? No problem! I didn’t have far to go!

After a few quick clicks, blip blip. Tiles beeped back at me and we were out. First impressions were great. This van is dope! I changed his name to stiles immediately. 

Picked up some snacks, coffee, a couple pillows and tried to get a ticket to Terrapin Family Band at Sweetwater back in San Fran. But that didn’t seem like it was going to pan out. So I bailed and headed south toward LA. Allman Betts was going to be at Orpheum in a couple nights. Tickets were out there. Sounded like a good time. 

Hit Big Sur along the way. Made life decisions. Ate some of the snacks. Slept near Pismo. Discovered I low key needed a pee bucket or bottle for those midnight callings. Sounds a little gross. But incognito pro tip, yo!

Allman Betts show was amazing! Love those great American songs. Brought out tons of talented guests. Straight southern rock showdown. But no time to dilly dally. Needed to get this multi colored eye magnet van with no title or license plates out of the city of lights. 

Made it to Barstow late night after the show. Grabbed a few hours of sleep. Straight to Vegas the next morning from there. I love that dirty town. Tacos el Gordo. Al Pastor. Blackjack. A sparkly hat encrusted with the words Bitch or Baby. It’s better not to stay long enough to decide. 

I think I maybe got to Salinas, Utah before the 60 mph wind gusts waved my white flag. Called it a night in the Love’s lot. Made the haul back home to Colorado the next day. All in about 2,200 miles. Stiles is now sitting pretty at 224k+. 

I love the van. I couldn’t believe how well it ran and how easy the trip was. Great conversion. Super comfy. Cool graphics. Fridge is cold as a polar bear’s toenails. Stereo works perfectly. Didn’t get murdered at the shipyards. Backup camera and beeper to keep me from running into things.

So after a lot of procrastination, I finally decided to bite the bullet and invest in a NordicTrack treadmill.
I expected it to be functional, you know, belt moves, speed settings, maybe a few incline levels. What I didn’t expect was how much it would change my daily routine. The treadmill came with a touchscreen, built-in workouts, and a ton of preloaded programs. I ended up spending the first day just exploring all the settings like a kid with a new gadget.
Curious about options and prices, I even browsed Alibaba to see what manufacturers offer. There’s a surprising range: from compact folding models to high-end professional machines with full screens, interactive workouts, and adjustable inclines. Some of them looked like something out of a futuristic gym. It gave me a much better perspective on what’s out there beyond the brand names we see in stores.
Now, a couple of weeks in, I genuinely enjoy getting on the treadmill. It’s not just about exercise,  it’s become a small, meditative routine. I’ve even started timing my morning coffee and work emails around treadmill sessions. My living room smells faintly of rubber and victory now, and I don’t even mind.
