1j1noz4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j1noz4,José L. Piedra Cazadores Review – A Hidden Cuban Gem,"Sometimes, a cigar exceeds expectations in the most unexpected ways. That was certainly the case with the José L. Piedra Cazadores, a Cuban puro often overlooked due to its affordability and short-filler construction. Given to me by a friend who had been aging it for over a year, I initially thought it would be a casual, no-fuss smoke while tackling some chores in the garage. However, from the first puff, it became clear that this cigar deserved my full attention.

Presentation & Cold Draw: Despite its budget-friendly price, the José L. Piedra Cazadores looked impressive. The construction was solid, with no visible imperfections and a beautifully wrapped body that hinted at quality beyond its reputation.

On the cold draw, the cigar delivered earthy notes with a subtle hint of cardamom, and the draw was effortlessly smooth—an encouraging start.

First Third – A Pleasant Surprise

Lighting up, I was immediately greeted with light and creamy smoke that coated my palate. Flavors of chocolate, delicate coffee, and hay emerged, offering a surprisingly refined profile. What was supposed to be a simple smoke while working quickly turned into a moment of enjoyment. I put my tools down, grabbed a chair, and decided to savor the experience.

Second Third – Developing Complexity

As I transitioned into the second third, the cigar introduced an unexpected yet delightful new note—cookie dough. This sweetness blended beautifully with the now more pronounced coffee and earthy tones, delivering that unmistakable Cuban richness. The draw tightened slightly, but not enough to hinder the experience.

Final Third – Strength & Depth

The final third saw the body ramp up to a medium-plus intensity, with peppery notes on the retrohale. The coffee profile deepened into an espresso-like boldness, complemented by leather and rich earthiness. A lingering walnut aftertaste left a lasting impression, rounding out the experience beautifully.

Final Thoughts: From start to finish, the José L. Piedra Cazadores performed exceptionally well. The burn was consistent, the construction flawless, and the smoke output satisfying. When I finally laid it to rest, my ashtray was filled with four neatly stacked grey ash balls—a testament to its solid construction.

For a cigar often considered a ""budget stick,"" this was a revelation. It proved that price doesn’t always determine pleasure, and I’ll be making sure to keep a few of these in my humidor from now on. A fantastic value and a hidden gem in the Cuban cigar world!",1,1740910190.0,cigar_refuge,0,1.0,False

I wanted to talk about how NTs seem to have an innate drive to be ‘more’ than others, that seems to mess up our ability to mentally relate to them.

It is perhaps so pervasive that it is difficult to know where to start. If you walk down a street in a big cities, you get overwhelmed by these ‘wanting-to-be-more-signals’, from advertisements exerting their brands by associating themselves with beautiful people, to people walking very confidently on the sidewalk with a stern face, to people having a coffee in a chique cafe whilst sitting very elegantly and clearly engaging in some etiquette rituals,..

But again, it is so pervasive, and especially so when it comes to careers. It seems a central part of NT identity where they try to in both direct and indirect ways, become more than others.

Then there are all the interpersonal dynamics, where they have an enormous repertoire of tactics, strategies, .. that probably intuitively come to them, to slightly or less slightly position themselves as more than you or other people around them.

It is so pervasive it is almost impossible to keep track of them mentally, because it asks such a cognitive load.

And specifically in the context of PDA, a command or instruction also feels to me like the other person is trying to be more than me.

I was merely trying to describe this very core dynamic, but wouldn’t know necessarily what to do about it. Does this dynamic also hinder you in every step of the way? And it feels fundamentally off in a way that makes it difficult to relate to people mentally?",1,1740909791.0,PDAAutism,0,1.0,False

While ""Awesome Intelligence"" sounds like a term your high school math teacher would use sarcastically, it's Samsung's fresh spin on integrating AI into their budget-friendly Galaxy A-series. Essentially, they're taking the complex world of AI and squeezing it into a $300 package, like trying to fit an elephant in a phone booth—except this time, it might actually work.

**Why Does This Matter?**

In a market where being ""cheap yet cheerful"" is a crucial balancing act, Samsung's approach stands out. Budget-friendly smartphones have always had a reputation: decent features, middling performance, and the kind of intelligence you usually associate with a toaster. By branding their AI features as ""awesome,"" Samsung aims to elevate its A-series to something you'd actually boast about at a family gathering. With Samsung leveraging its powerhouse Exynos chipsets and AMOLED wizardry, they're crafting tech that aims to punch above its weight class.

**Features & Fail-Safes**

1. **Killer Specs, Killer Price:** The A-series isn't just riding on flashy AI branding. With a Super AMOLED display and 120Hz refresh rate, these phones are more refreshing than your Monday morning coffee. And let's not forget that feature-packed camera suite, making even budget-tier look like premium.

2. **Awesome AI, Literally:** This ""awesome-ness"" lets users tackle tasks like identifying songs in a Flash (Gordon would be proud) and remove unwanted photobombs with Object Eraser. Useful, unless you like to remember your uncle's awkward dance moves at that wedding.

3. **The Durable Workhorse:** With a 5,000 mAh battery, these phones are marathoners, built to last longer than your confrontation with that stubborn Classic Tetris boss.

**The Bigger Picture**

While Samsung doles out awesome for nickels and dimes, technology at large is seeing AI's democratization. The tech giant's strategy might redefine how ""intelligence"" is interpreted across market segments. Whether phenomenally popular or mostly mythical, Samsung seems ready to test if ""awesome"" can be achieved without breaking the bank.

**AI’s New Playground: The Finance Frontier**

Forget drones and self-driving cars; AI's got a new sandbox—wealth management. With Stuart Feld leading the charge, Raymond James is on a mission to weave AI into its very fabric, making those financial wizardry moves faster, smarter, and maybe even charmingly AI-sassy.

Let's break down what this means for the world of finance and beyond:

- **Cybersecurity Net**: AI is already cracking down on cyber threats like a virtual bouncer at the world's most exclusive club. Goodbye to cyber gremlins; you've just met your match.

- **Robo-Executive Assistants**: Advisors now have AI-enhanced sidekicks predicting their next move—like chess but with stock tips and client care.

- **GPT-Powered Portals**: A new generative AI-boosted intranet site yelling “stop asking, we got you covered” is evolving, pushing out pertinent info quicker than you can say “blockchain.”

**Past Meets Future**

Feld, a veteran with 30+ years in tech arenas, and stints at financial giants like JPMorgan and UBS, is not just playing catch-up with AI trends. He symbolizes a new era where technology doesn’t just support but transforms the game.

Raymond James’ CEO Paul Shoukry dreams of a world where financial services are so smooth, advisors have endless time to sip mojitos on virtual beaches while their AI buddies keep the cash flowing.

So here’s the real debate: Will we celebrate this AI revolution as the dawn of a smarter, more efficient world, or is there a risk we’re opening Pandora’s Box with no way to close it?

I've been reflecting on the feedback many of you shared about the Medium paywall on my articles. As a PhD student, I originally chose Medium because it seemed like a fair way to support the time I was putting into both writing and developing Obsidian plugin features, without directly asking for donations.

Things have changed now that I've finally found a job and finishing up my PhD (yay 🎉) - I don't need to rely on that monetization anymore, so I've removed the paywall restrictions.

If you find the content helpful, there's a ""Buy Me a Coffee"" option at the end, but it's completely optional. I'll be using any support to create more content, and for the next few months, half will go to charity.

For anyone new to Obsidian, I'm working on a straightforward beginner's guide - just the essentials without overwhelming you with plugins or complicated setups. I noticed a lot of new users get lost in the sea of available tutorials and options.

And for the protein scientist out there, I'm working on a plugin to visualize proteins :)

So anyways, enjoy these Obsidian guides and my other articles :)

Alright, let’s talk **appointment setting**—the mysterious world where you send messages, book calls, and (if you’re good) make **commission money that actually makes your friends question their life choices.**

But before you start thinking this is some “get rich by DMing ‘Hey hun’” MLM scheme, let me give you the **real deal.**

# What Even Is an Appointment Setter?

Imagine being the **hype person** for a business. Your job is to **start conversations**, build a little trust, and **get people on calls** with a closer (aka the one who actually seals the deal). It’s like being a wingman, but instead of setting up dates, you’re setting up **money-making opportunities.**

# Why Is This Job So Underrated?

1️⃣ **No fancy degrees needed** – Harvard? Never heard of her. You just need **decent communication skills and WiFi.**  
2️⃣ **Commissions, baby!** – The better you are, the more you make. Some setters start at **$1K-$3K/month**, but top ones hit **$5K+ pretty fast.**  
3️⃣ **You can do it from anywhere** – Coffee shop? ✅ Bed in pajamas? ✅ Tropical island with coconut in hand? ✅  
4️⃣ **It’s the FASTEST way into High-Ticket Sales** – Want to be a closer making **$10K+ per month**? **Start here.**

# How to Get Started (Without Wasting Time)

🚀 **Learn the basics** – DM frameworks, tonality, social selling (no, not cold-pitching strangers like a bot).  
🚀 **Find the right offer** – Business coaches, marketing agencies, and consultants need setters **every single day.**  
🚀 **Apply everywhere & network** – Facebook groups, LinkedIn, and Twitter (X) are gold mines for finding gigs.  
🚀 **Practice, get rejected, improve** – It’s a skill. The better you get, the **more you earn.**

# Reality Check (For the Dreamers)

❌ You won’t be making **$10K/month overnight**  
❌ If you’re lazy and scared of talking to people, this ain’t for you  
✅ But if you’re **coachable, consistent, and put in the reps**, this industry will **PAY you WELL.**

**TL;DR:**  
Appointment setting is **the easiest way to break into high-ticket sales**, requires **zero experience**, and can have **insane earning potential**—but you gotta put in the work.

If you’re down to learn and want a **real shot at making money online**, drop a **""Setter""** below or DM me. Let’s get you started! 🚀",1,1740909149.0,appointmentsetter,0,1.0,False

A lot of you asked how exactly I managed to shift my mindset, so I figured I'd follow up with more details about what worked for me:

1. Daily Small Wins: Manifestation can sometimes feel overwhelming when focusing only on huge goals. I started intentionally celebrating smaller manifestations daily—a good cup of coffee, a compliment, finding a good parking spot. This trained my brain to notice abundance everywhere, making larger goals feel more attainable.

2. Alignment Journaling: Every morning, I wrote about how my ideal self would approach the day. Not just ""what"" I wanted, but ""who"" I needed to become. Doing this regularly helped me naturally align my daily decisions and actions with my desired identity.

3. Gratitude with Purpose: Instead of general gratitude, I focused specifically on appreciating aspects of my life that mirrored my goals. For instance, if I wanted financial freedom, I'd genuinely feel gratitude for the stability or comfort I already had. This created a feeling of having rather than lacking.

4. Mindful Letting Go: This was the toughest part. Whenever anxiety or impatience creeped up about my manifestations, I practiced mindfulness techniques—breathwork, short meditations, or just grounding myself in the present moment. This calmed my nervous system and reduced resistance significantly.

Doing these things consistently, my mindset shifted from scarcity to abundance, and honestly, manifestation became less about ""trying"" and more about ""allowing."" Now, my manifestations come more naturally and effortlessly.

Would love to know if anyone else has tried similar approaches or if you have other techniques that work for you!",1,1740908780.0,u_kevinbeetle,0,1.0,False
1j1nc1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldOfDarkness/comments/1j1nc1y/idea_for_a_hunters_the_reckoning_npc/,Idea for a Hunters: The Reckoning npc,"Hi there, I have a for a potential npc that be used for Hunters: The Reckoning and maybe Vampire: The Masquerade. But I am extremely inexperienced with all things Whitewolf and so far my only real source of information is Hunters: The Parenting, the comments under Alfabusa’s videos, the various people that react to the series, some discussions on different forums, and a little bit of the white wolf wiki. 

I know only the most absolute basic outlines of the setting of world of darkness and suck at writing. So used ChatGPT to do most of the heavy lifting and made adjustments wherever.


So here’s a rough outline of the character, I would appreciate it greatly if anyone would be willing to correct this on any detail that doesn’t align with the lore or game mechanics or suggestions on how to make the character more interesting.


NPC Character Sheet: Nate Holloway

Basic Information
	•	Name: Nathan “Nate” Holloway
	•	Age: Late 40s
	•	Gender: Male
	•	Race: Human
	•	Profession: Hunter (Independent, specializing in supernatural diplomacy, information brokering, and problem-solving)
	•	Affiliations: Loose connections with multiple Hunter cells, various vampire factions (as an unofficial mediator), and a handful of supernatural contacts across different groups.

Appearance
	•	Height: 5’11” (180 cm)
	•	Build: Lean but solid, the kind of frame that suggests a lifetime of practical work rather than gym sculpting.
	•	Eyes: Dark brown, sharp and observant, always scanning the room for exits and angles.
	•	Hair: Black with streaks of gray, cut short but unkempt.
	•	Skin: Lightly tanned, lined with age and exhaustion.
	•	Distinguishing Features:
	•	A scar on his right forearm from an old knife fight.
	•	Faint but noticeable stress lines on his face.
	•	Always looks a little tired, like he’s running on too little sleep and too much coffee.
	•	Clothing Style:
	•	Prefers practical clothing—jeans, work boots, layered shirts or jackets with plenty of pockets.
	•	Often wears a dark leather jacket that’s seen better days.
	•	Watches how he dresses when dealing with the supernatural—cleaned-up for vampires, inconspicuous for hunters, functional when he expects trouble.
	•	Always carries a sturdy, well-worn duffel bag with essentials: burner phones, maps, a first aid kit, a change of clothes, and a few concealed weapons.

Personality
	•	Core Traits:
	•	Cautious, adaptable, and deeply pragmatic. He doesn’t take unnecessary risks, and he never makes a move without considering the angles.
	•	Not fearless, but steady. He knows fear is natural—it keeps people alive. The trick is not letting it rule him.
	•	A problem-solver, not a soldier. He’s not in this to kill things. He’s in this to survive, to manage threats before they spiral out of control, and to make sure people don’t make choices they’ll regret.
	•	Deeply wary of supernatural influence. His near-miss with becoming a ghoul left scars that never fully healed. He’s hyper-aware of manipulation, dependency, and the subtle ways vampires test boundaries.
	•	Demeanor in Social Situations:
	•	Speaks carefully but casually. He knows how to make people feel at ease, how to say enough without saying too much.
	•	Rarely raises his voice. He’s learned that keeping it even makes people listen harder.
	•	Knows how to play the “useful human.” When dealing with the undead, he positions himself as someone too valuable to discard but not a threat to their power.
	•	Sense of Humor:
	•	Dry, sarcastic, and sometimes self-deprecating.
	•	Uses humor to defuse tension, keep himself grounded, and test how dangerous someone really is.
	•	Morality & Ethics:
	•	Not a killer by choice, but not naïve. If he has to put someone down to keep things from getting worse, he will.
	•	Believes in control over destruction. Killing one vampire rarely solves the problem—controlling where they feed, who they target, and what they do is often the better move.
	•	Despises those who take away agency. Whether it’s vampires enthralling humans, hunters who treat civilians as collateral, or anything that preys on the vulnerable—he has no patience for it.

Background & History

Nate grew up in a small-town auto shop, watching his dad cut deals and his mom work night shifts to keep the family afloat. He learned early that survival was about knowing who to talk to, what to trade, and when to step back. When his father got sick, he gave up any dreams of leaving, running the shop himself and making the same compromises his old man did.

That was how he met him. A well-dressed stranger who paid in cash, never showed up during the day, and slowly started offering more than just money. At first, Nate figured it was just another shady deal—until the “favors” turned into something else. A sip of something that made him sharper, stronger, more alive. The high was intoxicating. The crash was worse.

By the time he realized what was happening, he was in too deep. The vampire never said he was turning Nate into a ghoul, but the signs were all there—dependence, trust, a subtle shift in control. One night, he overheard a conversation where he was spoken about like property. That was all he needed.

He left town that same week, burned every bridge, paid in cash, and disappeared. It took years to shake the paranoia, but he never let himself forget how close he’d come to losing control of his own life. That’s why he does what he does now—navigating the blurry line between humanity and monsters, making sure no one else ends up in the same trap.

Affiliations & Connections
	•	Hunters:
	•	Doesn’t belong to any one cell, but has contacts in several.
	•	Trusted enough to pass information between groups.
	•	Some view him as too sympathetic to vampires, others respect his pragmatism.
	•	Vampires:
	•	Has working relationships with several factions, mostly among the more politically inclined or those who see the value in negotiation.
	•	Absolutely despises blood bonds and ghouling, making it clear he won’t deal with anyone who tries to pull that on him.
	•	Some vampires respect him for his nerve. Others see him as an annoyance. A few think he’s a useful pet—until he proves otherwise.
	•	Supernaturals (Beyond Vampires):
	•	Knows just enough about werewolves to avoid pissing them off.
	•	Has crossed paths with a few mages and does not trust them at all.
	•	Keeps a network of “weird” contacts—people on the fringes of the supernatural world who know things others don’t.

Final Notes

Nate isn’t a warrior. He isn’t a leader. He’s a man who survives by knowing how to handle people—supernatural or not. He’s lived long enough to see both humans and monsters make the same mistakes, and he knows that power alone doesn’t make someone dangerous. Knowledge does. That’s why he’s still breathing. And that’s why, if you’re smart, you don’t underestimate him.",1,1740908650.0,WorldOfDarkness,0,1.0,False

I (28F) lost a best friend (25F) of 6 years, I feel relieved and like a weight has been lifted, but also extremely guilty. I don’t know if anyone can relate to my story, but I hope someone can give some insight into navigating these complicated feelings. 

TL;DR:
3 major events led to ex-bestie giving me silent treatment before telling me everything I’ve ever done that upset her over video call. She accepted by apology but kept bringing it up, and wouldn’t accept that I can’t forget it or act like it didn’t happen. She wasn’t enthusiastic about my engagement but expected to be very involved in wedding planning, got offended and upset when she wasn’t included. At my wedding she found out she wasn’t invited to an intimate event for my husband’s family and friends, and we haven’t spoken since. I feel relieved to not have someone who is overly sensitive and constantly calling me, but I feel guilty for letting go of a close friendship and making it difficult for my parents to be friends with her parents. 

I am not sure where to share this, but I need to let this off my chest. Over the past few years , my friendship with my ex-best friend slowly deteriorated and we no longer spoke after my wedding. The events leading up to my wedding were across a year and a half, so I guess I will talk about them here. 

1. Thanksgiving road trip
One thanksgiving, we went on a road trip to a city 5 hours away from us to meet her childhood best friend and go do some shopping for the weekend. When we met her friend and were talking, she started telling her about my then boyfriend (now husband) who is from another culture, and when talking about his (very foreign sounding) name, she said something about him being from a country that’s not where he’s actually from. Think of it like “he’s Mexican” but he’s actually Peruvian, or “he’s Chinese” but he’s actually Korean. It wasn’t the first time I’ve caught her in a moment like that, and in the heat of the moment, I snapped and called her racist. It was so awkward, and when we got back to our hotel room we had an argument which revealed other ways she’s been ignorant towards me as well. I pointed out how she hadn’t taken the time to remember key details about his nor my identities, she didn’t know what my ethnicity is (she assumes I’m the majority ethnicity from my country), she didn’t know the city where I was born or the city where I lived for most of my life, she didn’t even know what my mother tongue is called. I knew all these details and more about her. It was an eye opening experience for her and we spent the rest of the road trip back home teaching each other details about ourselves that the other might not know. 

2. Girls trip abroad
A few months later, we began to plan a 3-week girls trip abroad to my ex-best friend’s home country. She wanted to invite the Thanksgiving friend along, so we made a group chat and started planning. I saved all my vacation days at work to be used for this trip and my only restriction was that we don’t go on my now husband’s birthday, I felt it was important for us to spend it together especially because I knew a proposal was coming. One day, I got a sudden facetime call with both girls, where they shared their planned trip that falls on the exact date I  said was off limits. Their reasoning was that we had bank holidays that fall on that period and would save them some vacation days from work. I was upset, I felt disrespected and I felt that I was the only person who actually planned ahead to be away from work. I told them I couldn’t agree with this plan, I was honest about my reasoning and it came off rude. My ex-best friend called me back after and gave me a hard time, basically saying his birthday is not a big deal and I should be more understanding that the bank holidays will be more strategic for them. She revealed that she actually used some of her vacation days already and wouldn’t have enough for the whole trip otherwise. She eventually got extremely upset, saying she is organizing this trip for us to go to her home country and stay at her family’s homes and have her father arrange everything for us, and I’m not appreciative. So I backed out respectfully and wished her well. When she came back from her trip, she asked me if I was upset and I told her I wasn’t, I didn’t think it would’ve been a good fit and I’m glad she had a good time reconnecting with her old friends. 

3. The hiking day trip
Finally, everything exploded after I decided to put together a group of my closest friends, my ex best friend, my now-husband and his sister, and we all went on a day trip to a park and trail. The trip started out rocky with fresh new birth control messing with my hormones and starting to feel sick with what will later develop into a lung infection. I was not in the mood for dramatics or to lead anything, I just needed to step into nature and have fun. On this trip, lots of small things happened:
- She brought up rising islamophobia in our area (we’re all muslim). I know my friends were looking for an emotional excape for the day and I didn’t want to scare my boyfriend’s little sister, so I told her that we shouldn’t worry about that stuff, it won’t happen. She took this as me dismissing her experience as a hijabi.
- She kept asking me questions about where to go for tickets, what to do, where to stand in line, and I had no idea so I told her to just look for signs. I was impatient and snappy, and upset her. 
- While we did the different activities in the area, she said she had cramps and sat in the car for the entire 3 hours we were doing activities. It was very awkward, since it’s a group trip it felt weird to have someone come but not participate. I kept calling her and texting her to check in and see if she will join, but she didn’t come until we were ready to eat before the hike. 
- We took a chair lift to the hiking trail, she never mentioned being scared of chair lifts, and kept insisting on hiking up to the trail on her own. This was dangerous as there was no clearly marked way up, and no one was willing to go with her. Since her reason didn’t make sense (she said she just felt like hiking up instead), we convinced her to come with us. She screamed the whole way up. I told her to calm down, she got pissed off at me. 
- A few days before the trip she had texted my friend and misspelled her name to be how she sounds it out, which is incorrect. Think“Laura” instead of “Lara”. My friend told me about this and that she corrected her, but it happened again while we were hiking. So I went up to her when we were further ahead in the trail and told her gently “hey by the way i noticed you said laura instead of lara, it’s lara” and she got extremely defensive and offended. We had a bit of a yelling match and she walked away. 
- She walked ahead of us most of the trail and on the way back down the lift, she screamed some more, this time pissing everyone off. 
- We went home grumpy and upset. 

After this, my illness developed into a lung infection and I didn’t speak to her for a while. We had some phone calls but I was also in a deep depression from my illness so I don’t remember much. She gave me the silent treatment for 3 weeks before facetiming me to give me a pre-written dialogue about all the ways I’d wronged her. I apologized and gave my perspective, obviously never meaning to hurt her so deeply. She didn’t ever move on from this. A month later I left for a family trip abroad and then later got engaged when I came back.  I met with her briefly to give her gifts from my trip, and shared the engagement news with her before anyone else. Her reaction was less than enthusiastic, she made a joke about the proposal and said congrats, we hugged goodbye. She then left for the trip I backed out of.

Fast forward a few weeks, she’s back and trying to be involved in my wedding planning. We had many phone calls, some good and some awful. She kept saying “not to bring this up again, but…” and bringing up the hiking trip and more ways I upset her. I apologized each time, and at some point I ran out of ways to say sorry and asked her what she wants. She said she wants to go back to normal… which is impossible when you go through a silent treatment and many accusations of being an awful person. I tried to be better and fix the friendship while juggling wedding planning and work, however she kept pushing to be more involved. I had to tell her I wasn’t involving her with wedding dress shopping because it was something I wasn’t looking forward to. I have an overly critical mother that highlights my body image issues often, and an overly opinionated best friend does not help this situation feel any better. She got upset and said I would be just as upset in her shoes (I wouldn’t). I ended up ordering my wedding dress from an online boutique. She was very upset that I excluded her from the wedding planning - I excluded everyone except my fiance. When I finally had the chance to give her the invitation, she said she can’t make it because her childhood best friend from back home MIGHT get engaged and have a party at that time so she has to fly back. No tickets booked, no party date set, no real reason to say no. She gave the same excuse to my mom and my mom was standoff-ish about it too. She went crying to her mom, and her mom called out my mom over the phone, said stuff like “she would never lie to not come to the wedding, of course we’ll do our very best to be there”. It was so dramatic, and my mom got angry at me, accusing me of excluding my friend now that I have a man in my life. It was added stress to the already insane wedding planning. At the end of it all, she came to my wedding events. 

A week before my wedding, she asked to meet up for coffee, so we met at a shop and talked for a while to catch up. After a couple hours, I was ready to go home so I asked her if she could drive me back (we live in the same neighbourhood). While driving me back, she asked me if there was a reason I’m leaving early, and if I’m upset with her, but I reassured her I wasn’t upset and just felt tired and had a lot to do for the wedding. When we got back to my place, we sat in her car in my driveway for an extra hour listening to her work and health problems. Two moments that stood out to me:
- She said “not to sound like im belittling your disability but my back problems are basically a disability too, I cant do anything with them”
- She complained that she’s falling behind on projects and really needs someone to sit with her and plan them out, so I offered to help her, and she went “great! Are you free in a few days?” … my wedding week. 
We didn’t see each other again until my wedding that Saturday. 

During the wedding, she caught me before i walked down the aisle and tried to talk to me, telling me I look beautiful and asking if I needed anything (I needed her to sit down in her seat). She disrupted our dinner time by talking to me and my husband about how she wishes our friendship will go back to normal, how she talked to an Imam who told her this happened because of evil eye, and how she hopes one day we can put it behind us. We barely ate half our food before the photographer dragged us away to catch golden hour. We didn’t get any wedding cake because we spent too much time chatting with her and not enough time finishing our meals. I’m still pissed every time someone tells me how amazing the cake was. 

One thing we didn’t do was invite her (and many other guests) to an 
intimate reception party for my husband’s family and friends. She found out and got extremely upset. She grabbed me before i went for a speech to tell me that she knows about it, and the wedding planner had to rush me away before I can explain. Then when we got back to the dancefloor, she came up to me again to talk about it and i explained it’s something just for my husband’s side of the guests, but of course she was still upset because she likely thought she would be an exceptional invite to this event. It was extremely awkward, and after this she ramped up the clinginess. She followed me and my friends to the changing area where I changed into a more comfortable reception dress, and awkwardly changed with us. She kept following me around the dancefloor and fanning me, asking me if I need something, and generally paying way too much attention to me. I didn’t have bridesmaids for this reason, I have a few girlfriends and I wanted them to have fun as my guests. I don’t like being the centre of attention and I definitely didn’t want someone keeping that close of an eye on me. I couldn’t tell her to give me space because she was being objectively kind, but it was very stressful to have that extra attention as someone who likes to disappear to the sidelines when my social battery needs recharging. 

After the wedding ended and we all said our goodbyes, and I posted some photos from my wedding events. She asked for the photo with her to be removed because she didn’t look good, so I removed it. She didn’t interact with any of my wedding posts on social media, and we didn’t speak again after that day. 

I feel relieved, like this constant anxiety is gone from my life, which is nice. I used to panic when she calls me, I felt trapped and like my boundaries were constantly being crossed or disrespected. I felt like I was being a good friend to someone who wanted to appear like a good friend but didn’t provide the emotional support of one. I feel guilty because I let her down, I was so close with her and her family, and all of that is gone. Our parents were good friends and no longer talk much either because of this rift between us. It’s all really sad and disappointing. 

My parents asked me at some point to tell them what happened, and I told them that she was upset with me but never would accept that I’ve apologized and move on. And I gave them examples of moments I felt disrespected by her and they understood my position. 

I remind myself that I profusely apologized for my wrongdoings when she called it out, and I endured her silent treatment for weeks because I thought our friendship would overcome that rough patch. But honestly, things spiraled so out of control after I got engaged that I can’t think of being her friend after this. 

I feel like I have a warped sense of reality, like I’m missing something and everything I’m feeling is invalid compared to the amount of pain I may have given her. I don’t know how to handle this type of emotional turmoil. Does the guilt ever go away? How can I move on from this knowing my parents also lost friendships? ",1,1740908020.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Probably because for the 2nd print the toner was warmer in the beginning. Anyway, toning with madder consistently is hard! Any tips would be very helpful!

I love music and my favorite artists include Sabrina Carpenter(😍😍😍), Laufey, Olivia Rodrigo, Billie Eilish, Rosé, Bruno Mars, and lots of others but those are the main ones. I like cute clothes, piercings, Jewely, tattoos, and makeup. A fun fact about me is that I speak fluent German because of my grandparents are German immigrants. I also love iced coffee enough that I’d put it in an IV into my veins lmao. You may have noticed that I love lingerie and am working on building the collection.

I just need one person to stay.
One pair of arms to catch me when the weight of my own existence
becomes too heavy for my ribs to bear.

I swear, I used to know what it felt like - 
to be the reason someone smiled into their morning coffee,
to have my name taste like warmth on another person’s tongue.
Now I am an afterthought, a fading echo,
a ghost in the places where love used to live.

And God, how quiet the nights have become.
I curl into the side of the bed where someone used to sleep,
trace the indent they left in the mattress
as if pressing my fingers into the absence
will make it feel less empty.
It doesn’t.

I don’t want the grand gestures,
not the fireworks or the loud declarations.
I just want the simple things -
the weight of a hand resting gently against my back,
the sound of my name whispered like it belongs somewhere,
the soft hum of another soul breathing in rhythm with mine.

I want to be needed.
Not as an obligation, not out of pity,
but because something in me fills a space in someone else.
Because the thought of me not being there
makes them reach out in the dark,
searching for the place where I should be.

But the world keeps turning without me.
The phone stays silent,
the room stays cold,
and I am left with only my own arms to hold me -
and they have never felt like enough.

So tell me, just once -
if I disappeared, would you notice?
Would you whisper my name, soft and aching,
like the memory of something you weren’t ready to lose?
Would you hold onto me tighter,
or would you let me slip through your fingers,
softly,
softly,
until I am nothing at all?

He had left the shades up. It was clear that the killer had remained in the house for quite a long time, during and after the murders, but he had left the shades up.

Professor Hewitt had at least managed to get into the crime scene before every cop in the state trampled through it. There were only five officers in his way now.

He was gaining a sense of the killer. There was no shame there, no desire for privacy. Elaborate and gruesome acts had been performed, but with no hurry and no fear. This was different than the others, but it was hard to pinpoint why.

The signatures were all there. The intricate knifework, the repeated wiping of the blade on sheets and furniture, the ritual display of the female victims. It was the same man, certainly, but this time was different. More… comfortable.

“Anything yet, genius?”

“Shut up, Cheryl.”

“Come on, Jeff. You know this goes better when we talk it out.”

Jeffrey swatted around, shooing away imaginary insects. In the F.B.I., Cheryl had been his supervisor. Now that he was a mere civilian consultant, they were friends. Somehow this made her even more annoying.

“I can’t, Cheryl. And I can’t tell you why not.”

“Can we get coffee after? Maybe then?”

“Sure. Yes. Shut the fuck up.”

That was pushing it. He just had to hope it would work, that she would take a hint. *Not here. Not now.*

It was… slower. This scene was slower than the families in Harrisburg or Altoona. A lot slower than in Canton. Canton was fast, maybe an hour.

This was home. This was his territory.

Sneakers, just like every other time. Brand new. But there were handcuff marks this time, and that was different.

“Coffee.” Jeffrey half-whispered the word and walked out of the house, looking at no one.

Cheryl followed. As soon as she got to the car, Jeffrey turned.

“I need a woman,” he said.

“Well, I’m married, genius.”

“A woman cop. Local, one who’s been around a while. I see three here.”

“Oookayy. Well, I know Wanda. Her husband is my cousin, so she’s a cousin-in-law? Is that a thing?”

“Jesus hell, Cheryl, I don’t care. Will she answer questions without being a pain in the ass like…”

“Like?” Cheryl laughed. “I’ll bring her over. I assume you want this unofficial?”

Jeffrey nodded, and resumed swatting imaginary bugs. He knew it looked weird but he couldn’t help it. Annoyance made the bugs happen.

“Hey, Cheryl. How’s Aunt Lucy?” asked Deputy Wanda.

“Not now,” Jeffrey interrupted. “Deputy, I need two answers and I need you to keep this to yourself for now. Can you do that?”

Wanda looked at the odd man, and then at Cheryl, who nodded. “Yeah, OK. For now.”

“Good. Were the lights on in the house when police arrived?”

“Yeah. Like, all of ‘em.”

“OK. No fear at all. Now, have you seen any officers wearing sneakers?”

“What?”

“Sneakers. Tennis shoes. With their uniform, possibly.”

“Look, I’m not gonna…” Wanda stood straight.

“You *are* gonna,” said Cheryl. “I know you saw them. Tell us who, Wanda. Right now.”

Wanda’s eyes grew large. “Uhh… well, he ain’t got ‘em on no more. Sheriff Higbee. This morning he had on sneakers. I figured he been… jogging…” The absurdity of this idea was apparent as all eyes turned to the man in question, and his considerable gut, as he arrived at the scene.

“Stay here, Wendy. Stay right here.” Cheryl grabbed her phone. “Jeffrey… are you sure?”

Jeffrey nodded. “It was a guess, but now it’s not.”

Cheryl started to make a call, but just then, the Sheriff strode into the house. “Where the hell is he going?”

Jeffrey jumped out of the car, and Cheryl came close behind, leaving a stunned Wanda. They stormed up the stairs, causing a bevy of officers to put hands on holsters.

“Stop him! Stop the Sheriff!”

Sheriff Higbee held a blue teddy bear like a hostage, digging around the inside. Before anyone could react, he removed a thumb drive and crushed it to pieces with the butt of his pistol. *Hidden camera*, Jeffrey thought.

A tense standoff ensued, but the Sheriff surrendered once the other officers rushed in.

“OK,” said Cheryl a while later, sipping coffee at last. “So you were right. Again. But why did you need a woman cop?”

“To be sure we weren’t asking the perp.”

“You really are a genius.”

1j1mww9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j1mww9/remember_jim/,Remember Jim?,"Professor Jim was an old teacher from our university days. A short, bald man with a thick mustache, he taught history. He’s the reason I passed that one impossible test.

It’s been years since graduation, but Jim still visits me sometimes. Not just me—my old college friends, too. We all remember him.

But I don’t think he exists.

I can describe him better than I can describe myself, yet if you asked me to prove he was real, I wouldn’t be able to. None of us would. There are no photos, no records. Ironic, isn’t it? A history professor with no recorded history.

I was with my best friend, Matt, when it started.

It was a usual evening at his place, the scent of barbeque in the air, the low hum of summer insects in the background. Matt was scrolling through his old photos, deleting them to free up space, and I sat beside him, laughing at the memories flashing across the screen.

And then—something felt off.

I leaned in, eyes scanning the familiar faces in a group photo from our university days. It was all of us—our friends, the classmates we barely spoke to, even a professor or two in the background. But…

""Where's Professor Jim?""

Matt barely glanced up. ""Oh, you know, he hated being in photos.""

I frowned. That was true… wasn’t it?

""Yeah, but… not even one? He was always around us.""

Matt shrugged. ""Guess he avoided the camera pretty well.""

I hesitated, something gnawing at the back of my mind. ""Hey, what was his full name again?""

Matt smirked. ""Professor Jim, obviously. So his last name must be Jim."" He chuckled.

I laughed too. But in the back of my mind, the seed of doubt had already been planted.

---

I went home that night and spent hours—maybe the entire night—searching through old photos. Our golden days of youth, frozen in time.

And yet, Professor Jim was in none of them.

It was strange. Too strange. Even for someone camera-shy.

I told myself there had to be some proof of him somewhere. He was a professor. He worked at the university. There had to be records.

I pulled up the faculty listings, skimming through the names.

History. Literature. Sociology. My old professors were all there—except Jim.

I widened the search. Maybe he was part of another department. Maybe he wasn’t a full professor but a guest lecturer.

Nothing.

Professor Jim was an assistant English professor. Or was he?

I checked English. I checked every department. Every subject. Even the non-teaching staff.

Still nothing.

A tightness built in my chest.

Had he even worked at my university? Or was he just… there? Was he even a professor at all?

Or did we just call him that?

I woke up at my desk, stiff and aching.

The glow of my laptop screen flickered in the dim morning light. I must have passed out mid-search. My mind was still hazy, but one thought pressed through the fog.

Cindy, she was the closest to him. She’ll remember Jim.

I scrolled through my phone and dialed her number.

She picked up after a few rings. “Hello?”

“Hey, Cindy. It’s me.”

“Hey! What’s up?”

I hesitated. The question felt heavier than it should. But I had to ask.

“…Do you remember Professor Jim?”

“Yeah, of course. From the university.” She sounded casual, unbothered. But then—“Such a tall guy he was.”

I gripped the phone tighter. “No. Jim was short. Bald. A bit on the heavier side. He taught Political Science.”

Cindy laughed. “Are you messing with me?”

“No,” I said quickly. “Cindy, remember? You helped me with my poli—”

I stopped.

A cold wave washed over me.

I didn’t take Political Science. I had never taken that class.

Jim taught Politics? No, that wasn’t right. He helped me with my history project.

But hadn’t he also—

“Hello?” Cindy’s voice snapped me back. “I know you’re messing with me. Not funny.”

The line went dead.

I stared at my phone, the empty silence pressing in.

The screen dimmed. The call log showed nothing.

My fingers trembled.

Who is Jim?

---

As a last resort, I decided to call all my friends for a party.

If Jim was real—if he had ever been real—then surely, out of ten people, someone would remember him correctly. Someone would verify that I wasn’t losing my mind.

The night of the party, laughter and conversation filled my apartment. It felt normal. Familiar. Grounding.

Then, over dinner, I brought up Jim.

At first, there was confusion. Blank looks. The kind of pause where people search their memories and find nothing.

Then—realization. All at once.

“Oh, Jim!” someone said. And suddenly, everyone was talking.

The party became about Jim.

Everyone had stories, memories, moments shared with him.

Except… none of them matched.

One swore Jim was a tall man, clean-shaven, always wearing a brown coat.
Another was certain Jim was overweight, bald, with a thick mustache.
Someone else laughed, insisting Jim was a woman.

The contradictions piled up, but no one seemed to care. No one reacted when someone else's version of Jim didn’t align with theirs. They just kept talking, their voices blending into a single hum of recollection.

I tried to point it out. “Wait, but—none of this makes sense. How can he be tall and short? Clean-shaven and have a mustache?”

The conversation stilled.

They looked at me. Not with concern. Not with confusion.

Just—blankly.

A moment passed.

Then, like someone pressed play on a paused recording, the party resumed.

I swallowed my panic and forced a smile. Pretended to enjoy the rest of the evening. Laughed at jokes I wasn’t listening to.

Eventually, everyone left.

I was exhausted. Too drained to clean up. I collapsed into bed, the mess of the party still scattered across the apartment.

Sunlight streamed through the window. I forced myself out of bed, groggy, and wandered into the kitchen.

Dishes piled in the sink. I rolled up my sleeves and started washing.

One plate. Two. Three.

Counting them absentmindedly.

Ten… Eleven…

I paused.

Twelve.

My hands froze under the running water.

I called ten friends. That made eleven people, including me.

So whose plate was the twelfth?

A chill crawled up my spine.

Jim?

The dish sat there, the water swirling around it, as if waiting for me to understand.

---

I grabbed my phone, hands still damp from the sink.

I needed to talk to Matt. He’d remember. He’d help me make sense of this.

I opened my contacts list.

It was empty.

A hollow panic settled in my chest. I flipped through my old diary, my fingers trembling as I found Matt’s number. Thank god. Proof. Something real.

I dialed. The ringing felt like it stretched forever.

Then—click.

“Hello?”

Relief flooded me. “Matt! It’s me. Listen, I think Jim was at the party last night. I was washing the dishes, and there were twelve plates. But I only invited—”

“Who is this?”

I froze.

“What?”

A sharp breath on the other end. “Who the hell is this?” Matt’s voice was different—colder, unfamiliar. As if it was a different person.

“It’s me! Your best friend! You came to my party last night, we talked about Jim, and I—I don’t know how, but he was there.”

A long pause.

Then, anger. “Whoever this is, cut it out.”

""Matt, it's me.""

""My best friend is in my backyard right now.""

The world lurched.

Matt’s voice hardened. “So shut up, and don’t call again.”

The line went dead.

I stared at the phone, my breath coming too fast.

Backyard?

He said his best friend was in his backyard.

But I’m his best friend. I am.

A sickening thought took root.

Who is with him?

---

I had to go to Matt’s house. I had to see for myself.

I grabbed my keys and ran to my car. The engine wouldn’t start.

No matter how many times I turned the key, the ignition just clicked uselessly, as if the car itself was refusing me.

I wasn’t going to wait.

I slammed the door and ran.

Down the street. Past indifferent faces that barely shifted to make way for me.

The people didn’t react.

I was running like my life depended on it, sprinting down the street, gasping for air—and no one even looked.

Matt. 23/A Cloud Street.

I am coming.

Matt. 23/A… Where was I going?

I stopped dead in my tracks.

A wave of nausea hit me as I looked around. The buildings, the streets—familiar, but wrong. The world felt off, like a poorly constructed set, a trick designed to fool me.

Why was I running?

I tried to anchor myself. To hold onto something real.

I reached for my phone. My fingers trembled. My skin—was it always this color?

Lighter. No-darker.

My breath caught in my throat.

I turned, eyes darting wildly, searching for a reflection; proof that I still knew who I was.

A clothing store. I ran inside.

The guard didn’t even flinch. No one did. No one cared that a lunatic had just sprinted through the entrance, panting, desperate.

But I had bigger problems.

I needed to focus. I needed to remember.

I repeated everything I knew. Everything that was certain.

""I am…""

A pause.

My stomach twisted.

""I am…""

Silence.

I couldn’t remember my name.

When was the last time I said it?

When was the last time anyone said it?

The air felt thick, suffocating. I turned the corner, nearly tripping over myself, and staggered toward the nearest mirror.

I looked.

And there was nothing.

---

Matt sat in his backyard, a cup of coffee in hand.

Some weirdo had called him earlier—frantic, saying something strange. He barely remembered the conversation. Probably just a prank.

He took a sip, exhaling slowly. His gaze drifted to the empty seat beside him.

Someone should be sitting there. Someone important.

The thought lingered, slipping just out of reach.

Then again, his best friend Jim would be arriving soon.",4,1740906834.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False

Let me share some words on the packaging: the form factor is an original and i like the colors even though the camera might not do it justice. i think they could've leveraged the real estate on it a bit more as it feels a bit empty. some nice patterns or perhaps even a map of where the beans come from would be nice. there is very little story to the coffee as well, and with so much space they could've easily fit it in 

After a little more than 2 weeks post roasting i finally gave this one a try. A washed Red Bourbon that I decided to prepare with my newly acquired Stagg brewer. I had some pleasant extractions with it on other beans so figured it might do well here also.

I'm grinding the beans with a Baratza Virtuoso, at a 12-step setting. No special water, but the one from my tap is not that bad. Water temperature, at least on the kettle's thermometer, was around 98 degrees C. The recipe I used was basically a standard V60/Kalita with a 20-sec bloom, followed by three equal splits with around a 30-sec wait on each one.

I ended up at 390 ml, using 24 g of beans, so a 1:16 ratio. Just look at that beauty! :)

My first impression is not bad but perhaps a bit too washed out. I tried to brew it a second time with a finer grind but still wasn't completely satisfied. I was nevertheless still able to enjoy and notice the flavors specified by the roaster.

I liked the lemonade/red currant acidity in particular, and the mango note kicked in as part of the sweetness. The combination of lemonade/redcurrant acidity with the sweetness created the mango tone, which was very enjoyable.

To conclude, I found it to be a pleasant cup but on the milder side, with nice acidity and some sweetness to it. Even if I could probably tweak the brewing process a bit more, I still think there could be more to it. I'm not really sure whose fault it is though, as I've had a hard time getting a lot more from washed Red Bourbons from other roasters as well.",2,1740906657.0,pourover,0,1.0,False
1j1mu0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/1j1mu0p/advice_for_sound_system/,Advice for sound system,"I'm in the midst of preparation for renovating my apartment living room and I want to account for a nice, budget system that'll be used for basic TV watching, watching movies and listening to music. I won't have the budget for a nice high-end surround sound and also won't be able to route channels for the cables for them because all the walls are steel reinforced concrete.

Some info about the room:
6,1m x 3,5m, ceilings are at around 2,6m. In imperial that would make something like 20ft x 11,5ft and the ceilings at about 8,5ft.

The furniture will be ceiling height bookcases in one end, cabinets on the other, sofa, armchair, coffee table, etc. in the middle with a similar arrangement on the other side but instead of a sofa it'll be a 65"" TV, mounted on the wall with a media cabinet underneath. 

I was thinking of maybe building a 3.1 system that could potentially satisfy my needs but I'm not sure if there's an option for remotely switching the center channel off for music-only listening. I'm also looking at ways to be able to control everything with a single remote.

So my question is - is there a way to build a nice sounding 3.1 system for about 500$ tops (I'm in Europe so 500€ to save you the conversion) that can be used for both music, movies and TV? 

Also - is a soundbar for TV/movies with a separate mini HiFi system + sub for music, a viable alternative?

Recently I (27m) have fallen to depression after moving back home for two years. This is the first time I have stood up to my parents. I used to be a good noodle but no longer want the stars. I sent them each a letter in a group chat together.



As my parents are refusing to respond I would like some advice. (parenthetical comments are added for some context for Reddit)



=== start text: me



I wrote you two a letter explaining our relationship. Im turning my phone off.



sorry



=== end text: me

=== start dad.txt

Dad,



I have always hated you.



When I was a child I first thought you were silly.

Later I thought you were mean.

In my teens I thought you were an asshole.

I now realize that you are a low-functioning alcoholic.



You have heckled me my entire life and I fucking hate you for it.

You have heckled all my friends for being weirdos, losers and lame until I never brought friends home again.

You have heckled all of my girlfriends until I never brought one home again.

For some godforsaken reason you chose to be someone THAT I ACTIVELY NEEDED TO AVOID. YOU ARE A HORRIBLE FATHER.



I grew up with a neurotic mother who beat any masculinity out of her sons. You neglected your sons and shunted all the parenting on mom. It's the weirdest feeling to have you always home and never present. You never cared about us.



I have invited you to play cards hundreds of times, and you always refused. I have invited you to video games thousands of times, and you always refused. You have never taken an interest in us. While other fathers would take their sons to bond and build memories, you have NEVER done anything like this. We were just tailgating with you. 



My first memory of you was I was very young. You were belligerently drunk and talking shit to me. I uncharacteristically sent my self to bed early. You came into my room to talk to me. I said I didn't want to talk. You then laid on top of me with your full body weight and tickled my neck with your beard. I was laughing and screaming unable to breathe. Gasping for air I screamed, ""I FUCKING HATE YOU"". You then left and mom told me that I was to, ""NEVER TALK TO YOU LIKE THAT AGAIN"". You are a worthless alcoholic and a child abuser. You never spoke to me about this. FUCK YOU.



One of my formative memories was around fourth grade. I asked you to play catch. I knew that baseball was getting competitive, and I needed lots of time in to improve. Mom would never let us leave the house, Brother was busy with his suicidal tirades. I really wanted to have time with you to play catch. You told me, ""Sorry I need to make a drink and sit down"". We never played catch again. I quit baseball shortly after. I found 'Cats in the Cradle' and have held that song dearly since.



I think it was around middle school I asked you for help with Brother. He has caused me a lifetime of pain. You told me, ""I know, it sucks, there's nothing I can do about it."" I began to beg for your help, and you shouted, ""DROP IT"". You absolutely shirked your duties as a father. Did you see the heart break when I realized that you gave zero fucks about me? Did you notice that our relationship has soured ever since? I stopped asking you for help so that you could not disappoint me. THIS IS CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT. IF Brother WAS SUCH A MONSTER YOU SHOULD HAVE INSTITUTIONALIZED HIM. YOU FAILED ME AS A PARENT. ACCEPT THE FACT THAT BY ENABLING Brother YOU ABUSED ME. I WILL FOREVER HATE YOU FOR THIS. YOU COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING, ANYTHING AT ALL AND YOU CHOSE TO SHIT ON ME INSTEAD. FUCK YOU.



So I have a mother who abuses me into accepting; a suicidal maniac for a brother, a bullying cunt for a sister, an abusive alcoholic for a father. I will never understand your contempt for me.



You have never been a parent. You are just a sperm donor. You hate your fathers, and I have always hated you. You have made sure the cycle of abuse continued. 



I know you will think of all the times that we spent camping at the beach and think that they are fond memories. Watching you get blackout drunk every summer while trapped in a box with my horrible siblings is not fun. There was a time when you would dig holes, fish and play with me. But that quickly got replaced with a routine where you would set up, get drunk and return to your standard hapless state.



At home, you thought family time was when you would ruin a movie by talking over it until you blacked out. I never enjoyed this. You know your sons love playing games and would LOVE to play with you. But you were usually too drunk to function at any capacity more mumbling at the TV.



It hurts me deeply to have seen other fathers actively play positive roles in their sons lives. I have only been an afterthought to you. You have never taken the time to get to know me. Mom would put you up to spending time with the ""boys"". You would take us out once a year if even and then be done with it. I have no positive memories of us together.



I always hated hearing the ""boys"". In my head when I think of Brother the phrase ""useless fucking retard"" comes to mind. He dragged his feet and came crying and screaming to everything you tasked us to do together. Then you would reward us equally even though I would do 90% of the labor. If I never saw him again I would be quite pleased. He has been determined to make my life miserable and YOU ENABLED HIM TO DO THAT.



Just once in my life I wanted you to spend time with ME, but clearly it was an impossible ask. Mom would take Sister out to do girl things and bond. You have only ever thought of me as free labor. Instead, the sperm donor would get a two for one deal on his basic parental obligations. What a steal! With all that free time you have more freedom to continue being a miserable drunk. I know it's hard for you to do anything other than drink.



It was supposed to be your role to be the example of a positive masculine figure. You instead taught me remorse, sorrow and regret. Both mom and Sister did severe damage to Brother and me. You watched it all happen and never said a word. This family was only an afterthought to you, if you ever thought about us at all. Instead, the only thing we ever got from you was, ""go ask your mother.""



I wondered for the longest time what you thought of our relationship. Why you were always so cruel. Why any advice was hyperbolic and worthless. I AM A FUCKING JOKE TO YOU.



Should I ever have kids this is what I will tell them about you:

My father was an abusive alcoholic who neglected his family.

He was always home and never present.

He bullied his sons until they hated him to the core.

He never took the time to bond.

He never knew me.

He had all the time and money that anyone could want to raise a family and chose to be a horrible father.

He was not kind to others.

He never had anything nice to say.

He had no friends.

He bullied me for my friends until I had none.

He made a mockery of me for any girl that I was seen with, so I never brought a girl home again.

He scolded me frequently and never provided me praise.

He was a tragic drunk who drank through all of my milestone moments, graduations, and sporting games.

I snapped at him many times, and he never changed his ways.

The only time I called him when I had left the house was when I was on death's door.

There were many moments that I prayed to god for a father, but the universe had decided that I had to endure you.



When I was in Phoenix and I felt my health failing (Medical complications brought my weight from 185 -> 130lbs requiring surgery) I hope you know that asking for your help was quite literally my last resort. I have never wanted to talk to you. You have made it clear that you don't give a fuck about me. I have lived my entire life without a father.



When I ask you out for lunch and want to do something special you decline, then ask to go down the street for ramen (Cash grab ramen shop owned by Arabs and run by Mexicans, No hate, it just sucks) you know disappoints me. You cannot afford thirty more minutes of driving time (To our Asian district with first generation restaurants) to make meaningful memories with me. Like the rest of our relationship you go through the motions just so that you can be a father only in name.



I hate this family so much that I will likely never have kids. You had all the means to have a great family and squandered it. My life will be exponentially harder than yours and I do not want to go through this ever again.



You have continually failed me as a father. I pray my children will never have to meet you, so they won't suffer as I did. You have taught me that men in the MyFamilyName family are horrible fathers. You know exactly what I feel when I say I hate you (His mom is a gold digger, he had several fathers he all hated, we know grandma had at least five marriages, his family tree is wild), yet you somehow chose the wrong options all over again. YOU are a piece of shit. Fuck you.



I hope you understand I was painfully sober while you were enjoying the MyFamilyName family shit show. What a waste of a life. Your drug addled mind has never been able to comprehend the consequences of your actions. Mom has the same problem.



I have prayed to god for a family I can love and trust. Unfortunately I have you.



Your son,

MyName



If you want to play any role in my life, we are going to go to alcohol anonymous together, and you are going to read this to the group. If not, nothing lost, nothing gained. It's not like I had a father anyway.



Don't forget that you drank so much last year that you forgot to take your heart medication and almost died. I begged you to stop and yet you made multiple drinks with VERY long pours. Next time you will drink your self to death and I will shed no tears.



=== end dad.txt

=== start mom.txt



Hey mom,



I guess I should tell you what I have been feeling.



We have never communicated well because I have always hated you.



I have always hated this family.



You likely noticed a break in me where I gave up completely,

I have no intention of keeping up with the Jonses (When I first saw this movie my family started making so much sense.) anymore.



I have alcoholic mother who has never praised me, never encouraged me, and only ever filled me with doubt and remorse.



You have told me that all my friends are bad influences, poor, and unworthy. You are not a nice person. You are very fortunate in your circumstances and pretend that it is all of your design. I think you are vapid and unkind.



You have three children and treated them all differently.



Obviously Sister is your favorite, this is not a debate. Brother needed the most help and you always obliged. You always thought about me last, if you ever thought of me at all.



We were kids and did as kids do, inevitably someone is upset, and I was always the one to be punished. This turns into a game where they would start something, then get you to finish it. You made sure that I was always scolded, guilted and punished.



You trained me to never speak up. You trained me to never stand up for myself. You trained me to never manage my relationships in this family. You have effectively beat any sense of belonging out of me. How many times have you grabbed my the face and said, ""DON'T YOU EVER SPEAK LIKE THAT AGAIN""?



As such I grew up every night telling my self, ""You cannot let anyone control your happiness."" I thought of my self as an orphan. No parents to talk to, no siblings to relate to. Two drunks above, a suicidal maniac and a bullying cunt at my side.



You have said that I cannot bottle this up (I had three alcohol blackouts last year where this all started coming out, I have quit drinking and am 8 months sober). Who taught me that my cries fall on deaf ears? You are delusional when I speak to you. You lie right to my face and think you can assert your faux image of this family to me. I asked you for coffee to tell you that I have always hated this family. The first thing you said was that I needed to be medicated. YOU NOT ONCE THOUGHT THAT THE MY PROBLEM WAS WITH YOU.



How many times have I sat on your couch for you to tell me that it was my fault for being upset with my siblings, it's my fault for upsetting my siblings, AND IT WAS MY DUTY TO BE THE BIGGER PERSON. I didn't deserve dignity, respect or safety.



You tailgated my entire childhood. You were embarrassingly drunk at every graduation, sporting game and meaningful event in my life. If you noticed, I had never invited you to anything. You stunted my social life.



Brother doesn't even deserve a mention. I have been way nicer to him than he ever deserved. I honestly believe that you made him into a monster. You let Sister bully us. You encouraged every outburst and never curtailed his horrible behavior. There comes a point where I wish he did commit suicide, so he could get what he wanted, and I could finally have some peace. It's a horrible thing to say. But its par for the course in the MyFamilyName family. You don't care if we are miserable as long as the pictures are good (Mom was a compulsive scrapbook-er, now photo hound).



If you didn't want us to feel these things, you would have done better. You would have not drank every day, you would not have told us to freeze our relationships in the most painful positions, just so that you could take your Christmas cards.



I don't ever remember you praising me. You raised us by guilt. Guilt for every interaction, grades, behavior. It's no coincidence that both your sons are low functioning. As I get older I realize that you are a spoiled brat who had the money and looks to never have to maintain meaningful relationships with men. You selected a passé father to fill the role. You beat any masculinity out of your sons. You lie, gossip and shame us, then crack down when we snap. I for the longest time could not understand why you were unable to see Sister being a cunt, but I realize that she is just like you.



Sister has always been a horrible sister, taking lead from our parents to bully, gossip and shame. I used to have many memories of this, but most are now long repressed. You exacerbated this by setting the double standard that she is a girl, who can do no wrong. She knew this and exploited us.



It hurts to know that now that she wants her perfect family, she has started being nice to me. No care, never an apology that she happily bullied me away from this family. Like her mother, she wants pictures that prove the world of her perfect family. Like her mother, she has never considered the consequences of her actions. Like her mother, she refuses to accept that she has been an abuser.



There is a quote that I heard and often think about.

""The only hope in life is that your love for your children can be found in their relationships, so that when you are gone, your presence will always be with them."" (Strangely enough Tucker Carlson said this)



Your children have never liked each other. I have always hated them. I have always hated you. If the quote is true, then you do NOT love your children. I firmly believe that you hate me. Or you are such a dysfunctional alcoholic that likely you never realized that I felt this way.



Did you notice that I don't buy my parents or siblings gifts?



Did you notice when I started being ""busy"" and could not attend holidays?



Did you notice that I stopped sharing anything personal with you when I explicitly told you not to tell FriendsMom about the skid marks in my underwear (Went swimming at a friends house after school, found the marks and hid them, so their dog would not get them, then forgot to recover them), then you turned around and I heard you both cackling on the phone?



Did you notice when I stopped bringing girls home when you called me gay without considering that I'm tired of my father talking shit and I don't like seeing my mother foam at the mouth with the thought of another daughter?



Did you notice when Sister was bullying me at the beach, I threw sand at her feet, she through sand in my eyes. I dropped her on the sand, and you grabbed me by the skin of my back, a cunty thing you have always done, You then scolded me, and screamed at me, ""DON'T YOU EVER HIT A WOMAN AGAIN""



Did you notice that this was a practiced pattern of abuse that followed my whole life? Did you notice that Sister would bully me EVERY vacation as a pastime?



Did you notice when I went home and immediately applied to JobInCityThreeHoursAway and left this fucking house?



Did you notice I moved myself by hand, so you would not make a habit of visiting?



Did you notice the heart break in me when I was so excited to have my own space at FriendLandLord's, and you were so belligerently drunk you ranted about how he was going to kill me?



Did you notice I had to be on death's door to ask you for help?



Did you notice that I never call, never want to talk to you, never want to spend time with you? I have so much hate for you that I never wanted to owe you anything. More guilt trips, more nagging. I do not tolerate people like you. You lie. You manipulate. You gaslight people and it's disgusting.



I must be invisible, unlovable, worthy of hate and despair. Or at least that's what your behavior says. I pray to god I should not be as cruel and unfair to my children as you were to me.



Funny, I realized that you were a horrible person when you forced your kids to pick up beer cans that you threw off the hill. When I refused, you denied me food and the parental care to prepare me for school (Mom woke up my siblings, fed them breakfast and made them lunches. She let me oversleep, then shouted me awake, told me that I don't get breakfast or lunch because I did not listen. I grabbed a leftover baked potato from the fridge and put it in my backpack. My family calls this the potato story.). You made it clear that any defiance of your alcoholism will put my life in jeopardy. In this one moment I invented an image of a frozen heart, and it plagues my mind to this day before I sleep. You are such a cunt that you continue to tell this story with glee. You know that I hate this story and continue to do so. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?



I would like to repair my relationship with you, but I HAVE ZERO INTENTIONS OF REPAIRING MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY SIBLINGS. WE WERE DEALT THE SAME HAND WITH THE SAME SHITTY PARENTS AND THEY CHOSE TO MAKE MY LIFE MISERABLE. They could have been kind, and we may have been friends, but that time is long past. They are people that I would never befriend on my own.



Its unlikely that I will ever have a family. You had the money, the time, and still chose to fail. I have not the means, nor the motive to ever want to go through this again.



Knowing you, you will immediately start rationalizing this, attributing this to my drug use (small time drinker, big time stoner) or depression. This is not new. I have always felt this way. If you were looking there were signs. If you cared you would have done something. Unfortunately you have never shown any ability to accept responsibility for your actions. You can do no wrong. People like me, are clearly not worth your time.



If you ever again try to worm your way through my mind, ""It wasn't LIKE that"", ""I'm sorry you FEEL that way"", ""Don't worry we will get you on medication"" I will never forgive you. You need to realize that you are a monster. It would be nice for once in my life you could listen and understand, but you have never been capable of doing that. YOU HAVE ALWAYS TOLD ME WHAT TO THINK.



Why you chose to be such a horrible mother I will never know.



In the unlikely event I get married, I pray to god the woman I marry will be nothing like you. You are so problematic that I have to warn girlfriends that if they mimic your behavior our relationship will end immediately. Just know that there are woman who I have loved, and you have never met because I hate you and your fucked up family.



With only pain and regret,

your son MyName



You have never listened to me, so I'll say the important part twice.

I HAVE NO DESIRE TO HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY SIBLINGS. The time for us to have formed a meaningful relationship has passed. Please do not force us together. You have chosen to squander any opportunity of that happening. You make the rules of this family, and we are left to deal with the consequences.



If you want to play any meaningful role in my life, we are going to go to alcohol anonymous together and you are going to read this to the group. If not, nothing lost. It's not like we ever had a meaningful relationship anyway.

It seems like any time I have tried to talk to my parents you have only made excuses. You demanded that I was honest and took responsibility for my actions. Why can't you do the same? Is it possible for you to be decent human beings? As of now my parents seem totally irredeemable.



Not even a response from mom, half an excuse from dad. If Sister said the things I am saying you would move heaven and earth. Why must you make my life a living hell? Being a good parent is obviously hard. Not being a terrible parent is easy. If your child musters the strength needed to write a letter from the heart the least you can do is try.



Or is this the world where you still think that I am the problem? That I am saying these things for no reason? That I needlessly suffered for no reason? This family somehow only gets worse. What a joke.

	\- cool

 I would LOVE  to have a respectful conversation with you in person when I am back in town after March 6th.

	\- Due to your history of gaslighting I don't want to see your crocodile tears. You can write me a letter back. It'll make it easier when I have to explain to my children why they don't have grandparents. IF YOU THINK YOUR SONS BLEEDING HEART IS DISRESPECTFUL YOU ARE A MONSTER. FUCK YOU.



I was talking to MomsBrother and MomsBrothersWife before you texted and guessed it to the word. ""She is going to wait till she gets back, so she can cry in front of me. She wants catharsis and clearly shows no remorse.""



I am making great attempts to communicate with you MY WAY. Your way clearly has not worked for anyone in this family. If you were a good mom I would shower you with love and respect. Reap what you sow.



You can break the cycle mom I believe in you. Stop being a cunt. All you have to do is not pretend to be sorry for my feelings, and make a real apology. Accept responsibility for your actions. It's not that hard. You beat it into me, you know exactly what it should look like.



It's been eight months since we last spoke, and you clearly have learned nothing. Are you trying to make this difficult? You have the power to be a mother I can love. Act like it. You have made this family difficult, NOT ME.

Age: 34 years.

Profession: Software Developer in Bangalore (with some time in US also in the past).

US Assets

\- US based equities: 550K (60% Tech, 20% healthcare, 10% consumer staples and 10% bonds).

Indian assets: 5 crore (split across equity, debt, land and other asset classes).

Savings rate

\- I save around 1.23 crore from my salary each year post taxes. This is mostly invested in the stock market with a 50/50 split of debt/equity.

Others

\- Gold, PF etc I am not adding. But overall, this should be worth close to 50 lakhs.

Expenses rate

\- Supporting parents, brother and other people: 1.8 LPM

\- Myself: 40K PM

So, the overall story is I have around :- 9.6 crore  of disposable income. I want to be conservative and only use 2% as safe withdrawal rate which gives me only 1.6 LPM. I want to ask you guys on how to reduce expenses. My most common expenses include :-

1. Supporting family with medical expenses. Mostly things like OPD, Tests, Follow-ups. Is there any insurance which can be taken to reduce this cost? Almost everyone in my family goes to hospital every month once and overall spend is around 20-30 thousand Rupees for hospital charges only.
2. My family gets offended if you tell or ask them to spend less money. My mother throws in 25 thousand Rupees per month in kitty party but she guilt trips me.
3. My brother and his family is also dependent on me. I gave him 10 Lakh Rupees for a business but he has lost 9 lakh from it (not lost, but it is stuck in a limbo somewhere).
4. My wife is also not working so I have to be responsible for her also.

Overall, even after earning so much, I still live like a beggar. I think often if I can afford a coffee and use a very cheap phone. I think I can retire but not sure if it will be possible.",0,1740905865.0,FIRE_Ind,13,0.44,False

Control arms, half shafts, track rods, a whole bunch of other stuff replaced. The main clunk has gone which has made the car much quieter. And after five separate test drives in the car they have finally managed to make the car go straight.

Plus the dreaded vibration when accelerating has completely gone, which is absolutely fantastic.

However, driving back to Inverness, there has been a persistent rattle coming from the front right area of the car. My eight hour journey has currently lasted 12 hours because I’ve kept stopping to try and locate the noise. It just sounds like something is loose.

I have finally tracked down a rattle which appears to be coming from the front right fender camera which is rattling in its mount .
Unfortunately, I don’t have any tape right now, but when I get home, I’m going to take it off and seat it with some 3M tape to see if that stops the noise.

Second of all, I have to mention baby passed ASQ from 10 months on, except for birderline grey/white in gross motor (he has never crawled properly) 

Here is some of his profile based of some of the questions on Baby Navigator: 

- No conversationally babbling - he babbles and is very vocal and experimenting a lot of sounds and combinations of silables, but it’s  not directed to us. Still he has 50+ words he is saying in correct context (with the correct meaning) and he seems to be saying 1-2 new words per day. He also answers our questions most of the time with a word. He can point to a lot of body parts and say them - like nose, eyes etc. He even answers the question: What is baby’s name? Or sometimes: What is your name? With his actual name. So he definitely knows his name. 

- Some sensory issues ? it seems: hates clothes changed, his teeth brushed, his face washed and cream on his face. Baby massage never interested him, but seems to enjoy the game: this little pig..(with his toes). Never liked his hand restricted. 

-Sensory seeker? He loves to play “horse” with us and other people. Often he will ask to take him in arms and pace around the room while pretending to be a horse and gallop. He loves the movement and he will make certain sounds. 

- Sounds: he has a couple of sounds he hates like coffee grinder and smoothie maker and will cry/fuss when he sees me plugging them in. He also hates how real cows sound and will avoid real inages of cows, but can look at cartoon cows and listen to soft “moos”. On the other hand, I can go places with him, like the mall or with many people and he doesn’t seem to be bothered by sounds and will tolerate these places well. 

- Repetitive sounds and movements: he does these a lot (but they are not as restrictive yet). He constantly needs stimulation and doesn’t like playing alone - like I have to find him something to do or watch all the time otherwise he’ll just pace around the room and vocalise on and on (“awawawawa”, “ducuducu”, “lacalacalaca” etc.) But when I give him something to do, he stops (can be redirected). He gets bored of toys quickly. He also does these sounds when restricted in chairs - hates the stroller now and wants to be on the go - it could be a developmental thing as he learned how to walk independently. He’s not that bad with car seat, but after a while, he gets bored and will make sounds.(not cry) He also does hands repetitive movements like hand flapping (I’ve checked this on Baby Navigator), opening-closing one or both hands repeatedly, wrist rotation, wrist rotation while holding unto a toy. 

- There was a question if baby holds unto objects (besides blanket, stuffie or binkie) and my baby does that - all the time. He usually has a current favourite object in his hand. At one point it was plastic horses, then some spoons, random toys or pieces of toys he likes, yesterday it was a baloon his grandma gave him that had favourite dog cartoons (from books, not cartoons) on it. He never actually held unto a stuffed animal or blanket. I thought though that it could be developmentally appropriate at this age. He changes this objects frequently and doesn’t have a full meltdown if they get taken away - he just finds another object to hold. 

- Socially, he is very interested in people, but I know autistic people can be interested in people and have people as a special interest. My baby likes active games with us and other people, he’ll even initiate them (like chase games or peek-a-boo) He even loves looking at my old albums and we name people. He might be too interested though and seem to lack any social boundaries- he even chased children we don’t know at the mall. 

- Gestures he has: reaches to be picked up, points, nods head for no (still doesn’t nod for yes), claps and waves bye (he seems to be doing them only when prompted lately, but he knows the gestures, he just doesn’t seem interested in them). He follows point

- Doesn’t always answer his name or our questions. He seemed focused on something sometimes while playing or spaced out when not playing or he just seems to think about the question and not answer. But other times he answers - I’d say 60-70% of time he answers. 

- Immitates well now. He constantly tries to immitate us. His grandpa immitated how the key starts the car and he picked up on that quick. He’ll also show us and other people toys. He’ll bring books to other people to read to him. 

- He has some hand leading? He has developed recently. Sometimes he takes my hand to press buttons or manipulate a toy, but then he does it too with his hands..it seems more like: “play with me” type of hand leading than using my hand as a tool, but who knows. He doesn’t do this as often though. 

I am trying to see if there are any concerns here like Baby Navigator said and if I should bring it up to our pediatrician. I have to say we are not USA based (so no early intervention programs here)

Thank you very much if you read all of this.

I F/30, My partner M/56 (MIL/74)

I had my own routine where I'd have a couple hours either side of the day just for myself. The rest of the day was devoted to my child (homeschooling and keeping the home tidy so my clean in the evening during me time was super short half hour to an hour at most whilst I listened to a podcast or watch a TV show I could listen to or watch in earshot of young child. This half hour would be spent deep cleaning rather than tidying so it was short and sweet instead of a whole day focused on 'resting the home'. Making sure all surfaces are polished shower/ toilet/ mirrors/ skirting boards, making sure everything is organised back where it should be and so on. A sweet and simple half hour each night) this gave me enough me time each day to enjoy. It was amazing. Never felt overwhelmed or that I had to clean on my day off. Slept well, ate well with no interruptions (from child) and could shower and poop in peace which was really nice. I was a single parent who never had time away from child as we had no family so I tried my best to balance everything so I had some me time and this really worked. Anyway. Moved in with my partner and he doesn't agree with any of it. Now when I have a day off from being mum and child is elsewhere (which is a new thing) I like to do something/anything on my own as I don't get the couple hours either side of the day to relax anymore. Whenever I have the time my partners upset I haven't invited him or his mother to join me on whatever it is I'm doing. 
AM I RUDE FOR WANTING TO BE ON MY OWN WHEN I HAVE THE RARE CHANCE?

The other day I went to Cheshire Oaks on my own and the look around at my own pace in the shops I want to look in and then grab a quick inexpensive lunch where I want (we enjoy different foods. And different styles he loves grey/silver/mirrored everything where I'm more simple, organic more natural materials). I need a brake from all the grey so I appreciate being away from it all. 
My partners was working when I went, dinner was already made for him for when he got in, the house had already been cleaned, laundry had already been done. I wasn't spending his money either. I only went for necessities which I've had on hold for years. I thought I'd have been taking to piss to say I wanted to go when he got home from work.
WAS I WRONG FOR NOT INVITING EITHER OF THEM AND GOING ON MY OWN? 

I'm not much of a talker. I have my moments but I enjoy the quiet and I'd rather listen than talk. He, his mother and child love to talk. They get upset that I don't say much but Im talking all day non stop to child. I don't do much so don't have much to say on my part and my life. I'm happy to talk about whatever others are talking about but people always want to know about me and don't believe me when I say I'm quiet and boring. It's really that simple. A nice morning for me used to be wake up, make a flavoured tea and drink it outside in my secret garden watching my bunnies and dog play. Then Id chill out in the bath and slowly get ready for work. Cycle to work (talking all day) and then more or less repeat in the evening.

I message his mother to ask if she'd like to join us (child and I) on an activity but she won't always message back (msg read but no reply). I've called a few times and no reply. When she had answered a call she's been busy which is fine. But I have tried. 
She never calls and messages me inviting me or child anywhere or asking if she can join us with our plans. Which is fine. But why does it have to be me. My partners says she doesn't feel comfortable messaging or calling me but hasn't said why...  I used to message her something nice in the morning wisher her a nice day but often got no reply and thought I was bothering her so stopped. ""Good morning beautiful, hope you spelt well. Have you got anything nice planned for today?"" something along those lines. He said she liked them and they cheered her up by I rarely got a reply. He says it's because I don't call her. Older people call. But she says all the he time how she messages her grandson (I'm slightly older than the grandson). He thinks I'm rude that I don't call his mother and don't ask her out to coffee/lunch each week.
AM I WRONG/RUDE FOR ANY OF THIS?

I was shopping this week as saw some blue Lilly's. MIL and I are similar and I remember telling her how I liked the smell of Lilly's in the summer (in a well ventilated room) and she agreed. I was buying some for myself and thought I'd pick some up for her too. She likes the lemon cakes from the shop I was in so I thought I'd pick some up for her. I knocked in her door but there was no reply so thinking she was out and not wanting to make another tip back to her home I left them in her doorstep. My partners was angry that I hadn't called her to tell her I was at the door (left my phone in the car as I was only quickly dropping them off). Had I messaged her she'd have worried they'd be stolen and she'd have stressed and probably cut her plans short so I didn't bother. I thought they'd be a nice surprise for her for when she arrived home. (She doesn't have neighbours as such where she lives) People in the area have more than enough money to not steal some blue Lilly's and lemons buns. If anything they'd have hidden then more than I did.
AM I WRONG/RUDE FOR THIS?

We share the same birthday. I had my own boring plans. Cinema, grab lunch, window shop on my own and IF I could get a cheeky massage somewhere, that would have been my only gift and I've wanted one for years. MIL had plans with friends who cancelled. After dropping child off with a sitter my partner called and asked what my plans were then suggested I go to lunch or grab a coffee with his mother as her friends had cancelled and he told her I'm going to call her! (This would have been the first birthday in YEARS I'd have been able to do something). I suggested we could go round in the evening but said he thought it would be nice for us to both go out together. I just wanted a quiet day doing what I like at my own pace. Anyway, I called her she didn't want to go for brunch as she had a headache but maybe later if she's feeling better. So there went my day. I spent the first free birthday I'd had in years cleaning his house and making dinner for him watching my phone in case his mother decided she wanted to do something. She didn't but we did go over when he got back from work. (His mum is lovely that's not an issue at all). I know from now on we'll be sharing a birthday doing the same activity. This birthday is already planned apparently 😐.
WAS I WRONG/RUDE FOR PLANNING SOMETHING ON MY BIRTHDAY WITHOUT INCLUDING EITHER OF THEM? 
(This was the first birthday of mine he's remembered, she had plans and he was working so I was on my own anyway)

I'd much rather be rude/wrong as I can do something about it. This has never been an issue for me before and it's really messing with my head.
My 'friends' /mum friends are stupid yet partner wants to encourage me to be more social by hanging out with his mother, the old guy down the road (lovely man) or the neighbours across the road (again older than him). There's a couple a couple doors down who are closer to my age. Lovely but we are so different. They have 2 nice cars on their drive and a work van, they own their home, they had lovely parents, go on holidays, spend thousands on a single pair of shoes, all that lovely stuff (and good for them, again they are a lovely couple and it'd be nice to talk to them a couple times a year at a restaurant or have them round in the summer or something like that) where I'm from no family and was surviving of £30 a month for myself and child, and devote all my time to my child, drive a modest car which I was previously living in. It's really difficult connecting on something and I wouldn't be comfortable 'hanging out' with the lady as they are my partners friends and my life compared to them is just so different. Double date, any time but on my own I have fck all to offer. And again these people seem really nice. But I've got no idea what they're talking about most of the time. We're just apples and oranges. Cut from different cloth and at different stages in our lives. They're doing really well and I'm just getting over being homeless. It's not as though I did anything wrong to have been in the position I was but I'd rather the whole world didn't know and the questions being asked, oh my goodness. Had I been in my own I could have curved or stirred the conversation in a different direction but my partner would say just a little too much which would dob me in it. The first time I met them was awkward as right before my partner and I had had words. I hadn't seen him for 6months after I was uninvited to Christmas at his and then all of a sudden we have plans to go out with the neighbours. They'd have known I hadn't been around as my car would have been missing. They all drive nice cars so when the little shitty one that ruins the view goes missing it's noticed 😅. I'd already told him I wasn't going as I had plans. I wasn't drinking as I'd made a promise I wouldn't and he kept buying me cocktails and champagne and asking in front of them why I wasn't drinking. I was happy with sofa water (I absolutely love sofa water if it's on tap 🤤🤤🤤).so I was happy with that, but he wouldn't buy me any more after the first one because he wanted me to have the cocktails. I spent most of the time trying not to cry or seem upset/uncomfortable. So yeah it was real awkward and embarrassing for me. I felt so less than and I could tell they thought I was odd. I keep my head down and try to politely avoid them when I can. If I see them I'll wave and the hurry out of sight.

Sorry this is all over the place I'm trying to not to word vomit but type quick enough I'm not iced on my phone 😅. 

How do I fix being rude/selfish. I just simply enjoy my own company when I have the rare chance to be on my own but I seem to be angering/embarrassing my partner and upsetting MIL which I don't want to do.

Just to note. I like my MIL. I find it a little difficult being around her as my partner doesn't think out baby is his (I'm 8months). When he's in one of those moods he'll tell me not to contact his mother, out of respect I don't. Then the next thing he wants me to call her and invite her out to bond of whatever. Im finding it difficult to be around someone who doesn't think the life im growing is his. It's exhausting pretending everything is fine and dandy when it's not. It gets brought up every 3 weeks or so. I know it's his as I e never cheated (never would, I've ended friendships because one of them were cheating. I do t even want to be around it let alone be the person who does). He has ""medical"" friends who have said my dated don't add up 🙄. I spend most of the days trying not to cry or worry about him taking the baby away once it's born (he's threatened this many times when I said I'd leave due to this constant behaviour and feeling uncomfortable in his home). He's also mentioned social services a few times which scares the shit out of me. I look after my child and I've never put them in any danger. (I was between homes/homeless/ in hotels. To get away from danger. All funded by my savings. Governments never helped. All I've tried to do is the right thing and work with the hand I've been delt. I haven't complained just tried to move forward and do better). He tells his mother everything including things I've told him in confidence which I don't appreciate.
If he's said the 4 of us are going out I've always gone and I speak to MIL. If he's asked if I want to go I'll happily decline so they can spend quality time together and and get some me time to do nothing in quiet as I enjoy doing. But he finds me turning down an offer rude.

I don't like being called these names as I've never been called selfish, rude or embarrassing yet these people find me to be this way.
Read in-between the cracks as much as you can. I just want these people to like me and I'm at a loss as to what I'm doing wrong to keep irritating them. 

Again sorry its all over the place. I'm ummed and ared about posting anything at all.
I'll reply when I get the chance.
Thanks in advance.

1j1mhxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1j1mhxs/aitah_for_telling_my_niece_that_the_family_does/,AITAH for telling my niece that the family does not like her fiance and that I won't be at her wedding?,"So for context there is a 21 year age gap between myself and my eldest brother. This made it so me (28 F) and his oldest daughter (23 F) are very close in age and have grown up very close. 

I am very much the favorite aunt and have always considered us friends not just family. She comes to me when she has a problem she didn't want to talk to her parents about. She tells me about her boyfriend and friend problems. She would call me when she was in college and needed picked up from a party or bar. And I was the first person she told when her boyfriend proposed calling me at 6 am the morning after because she was so excited to tell me. 

Some context on her fiance, they have been together for 3 years and he is one year younger than her. She just graduated college in May 2024 and he is on track to graduate in May of 2025. They have their wedding scheduled for just a week after his graduation He is studying biochemical and micro engineering and is very smart,  more on the  introverted side with a dry humor. Since she introduced him to the family we could tell they are serious and tried to be as welcoming as possible inviting him to family events and on trips, getting him birthday and Christmas presents and genuinely trying to get to know him. Whenever he is around our family he acts annoyed all the time like its painful to spend time with us, and he expects my niece to stay by his side the whole function getting annoyed if any of the little cousins ask her to play including my children (more context my niece is my children's godmother) and expects her to leave at the same time as him even if they drove separately. My eldest brother is constantly advocating for him saying he's just introverted and the size of our family makes him uncomfortable insisting that he's different when it's smaller groups or one on one but I haven't seen it even when it was just the two of them with myself and my husband. He talks to everyone like we are stupid and is extremely condescending. 

When they got engaged things got worse. With how close we are I was expecting to be asked to be apart of the wedding party but she did not ask me. I was a little hurt but I chose to let it go because it's her special day and her choice. Then his family planned the engagement party and didn't invite any of my family. She explained that it was just a small affair (just their parents and siblings) but I later found out she lied to me when I saw pictures on social media. I did confront her about that but she said she didn't plan the guest list so I tried to let that go too. Then she didn't invite myself or my mom to her dress outing saying it was a limited number of people allowed and she wanted to make sure his mom and sisters could come with her. After that I told her that it really seemed like she was trading our family for his family. She said she wasn't but when I asked them later how they planned to spend holidays he said they'd spend them with his family. 

My last straw was over December and January. In December she invited me and my husband for dinner. I was excited because she hadn't initiated us hanging out since her engagement. Dinner was nice a little awkward since conversation wasn't smooth with her fiance but pleasant enough. When the check came my husband took care of it after it sat on the table for about 15 minutes and they didn't offer to split or pay even though they invited us. Then when we were ready to go they asked if we could have a serious conversation. I was confused as to why we didn't have it during the meal but they proceeded to ask us for money to pay for their wedding. She said it was turning out to be more expensive then they thought and needed help since their parents don't make enough. I asked why they didn't wait until he was working and not just in an unpaid internship or until she got a full time job instead of a part time job. I said that I wasn't saying no but that I just wanted to understand why they wanted to have their wedding so fast (the wedding is about 8 months after their engagement). That conversation devolved into an argument about financial responsibility where her fiance said if we can help then we should because its family. And then following up with us having plenty of time to resave when my husband explained a lot of our money was invested for our childrens future. After we offered 2g as a little something to help, my niece brought up my savings from my deceased husband's life insurance. I asked if she really thought bringing up my deceased husband was going to help her. We then repeated our offer of 2g and he asked if that was really all we'd give them so we withdrew the offer. We left enraged. 

Then before Christmas my mom invited them over to bake because the fiance enjoys baking desserts and bread. He was so rude to her throughout that she came over for some grandkid time and tea because she was so sad. My dad was pissed. And then neither my niece or fiance came to Christmas. We had a family get together around new years and when we were driving two of my brothers and their wives home we had a conversation about how sick everyone was of the fiance and how we wished they weren't getting married.

Finally in January it was my parents 50th wedding anniversary I planned a party for them and then we were going to Mexico which was group financed by myself and my siblings for our parents. Fiance was only coming to party as he couldnt miss school for mexico. The party was fancy, rsvp invitations, private venue, catered, semi-formal dress code. A week before my niece text me and let me know fiance wasn't going to come to the party because of a fraternity event. I told her that this was an important family event and on top of that it was rude to skip out on an event that you've rsvped for without a good reason and made it clear that I didn't consider his fraternity a good reason considering how long he's known about the event. She said she'd talk to him but I never heard back so I was unsure if he was going to come. 

Day of he showed up late wearing a t-shirt, jeans, and backward cap. My mom still trying to be nice said she was glad he was there and he responded ""like I had a choice"". He then stayed in his seat not speaking to the people at his table or participating in the activities. About half way through we were taking a family picture and invited him to be in it and he said ""this isn't my family"". My mom started crying and excused herself to the bathroom. I pulled him aside and snapped I told him that if he didn't want to be in this family to get the f- out. That I was tired of dealing with his attitude and disrespect, and pretending to like him and told him to leave. When my niece went to follow him I told her that if she went with him that she should forget coming to Mexico with us. She didn't follow him but she made it clear that she was upset that he'd been kicked out. The adults in the family (about 12 of us) sat down with her to air out our grievances about the fiance with her so that she understood the extent of the problem, but she still defended him said that we just didn't know him as well and that we made him uncomfortable. 

After that conversation I told my husband that  I just couldn't act like nothing was wrong anymore. So we declined on the RSVP to the wedding. She text me asking why we said no and I met her for coffee. I explained to her that I didn't feel that I could support her marriage that he wasn't a good person and I felt like her independence and everything that was special about her was disappearing behind his expectations. She disagreed and told me that I just didn't understand. She then told me that if I really cared about her that I should suck it up and come to her wedding.

Help me choose a Dual Boiler [$5k],"New to making coffee here, but certainly not new to loving coffee. I've been toying with the idea of getting a proper coffee machine for some time now, and every time I get close to diving in I find myself going around in circles as to what to buy, and how ""all in"" I should be going. 

On this particular edition of the cycle, I woumd up at two finalists. The Lelit Mara X or the ECM Clasika PID. These two machines drew me in because of their reputation for having really good temp stability/accuracy and came in at a reasonable price point for a serious 'entry+' coffee machine. I've read plenty of threads on here talking up both of these machines, only to dive so deep into them that I find the purests saying that a SB or a HX just won't cut the mustard, especially when you start to consider bringing the occasional milk drink into the mix. So I'm kinda back to square one. 

I guess my needs will help. My wife and I both drink between 1-2 long black coffees each morning, and where my wife works from home she might do a 3rd later in the day. We are both partial to a flat white from time to time, and it's likely that the number of those will increase if we have access to a machine capable to making a decent one. As far as wanting to learn about coffee in depth, that falls to me with my wife very happy to take a back seat, provided she is able to make a coffee with ease wothout me. So a machine that can be played with (temp, flow control etc) is essential, but should also be able to be used by someone with some basic instructions. I'm a bit of a nerd when it comes to various kitchen/cooking related things, and I don't intend on that being any different in my coffee journey. So I'm really looking for a machine that has all the good trade marks to create great, consistent coffee, and pull a shot that can continue to be refined as I dial in the machine. 

This has led me to thinking I need (or maybe want?) an e61 group head, digital PID, shot timer, flow control machine capable of pulling back to back shots with the option of milk shortly there after. 

Now, I know I could start with the Mara X or the Clasika PID and upgrade later, but I'm not convinced that I want to go through that purchase only to breakup with the machine in 2/4/6 or whatever years later, only to get a DB then. I'm thinking stuff it, let's just get the DB now and be set! 

This has led me to the Lelit Bianca. And by all acounts this is a wicked machine, I'm finding it hard to find a bad reciew. Keen to hear what you all think? 

My question is, what else do I need to consider as far as DB's go? I see so much back and forth on brands like Bezzera, Quick Mill, Isomac about poor build qualify and issues etc, and then hear a lot of good things about others like ECM. What other brands should I really be considering in the DB market? 

I'm living in Australia and my budget is around AUD$4500-5000 for both a machine and a good grinder (don't need to go into this now but was going to get something like the Eureka Mignon Specialita 55). Those are going for about $800 at the moment, so leaves me between $3700-4200 left for the machine. 

TLDR: looking for a DB machine and need advice on if a Lelit Bianca is where I should stop looking, or if there are other contenders I need to be considering. ",2,1740904606.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

I was staying at an Airbnb in Eastern Los Angeles, in a mid-to-upper-class area. I had driven down Cesar Chavez Blvd and marveled at the illustrious metropolitan variety before my eyes. The Latin influence—its buildings, eateries, architecture, culture, and food—burned into my psyche as I lay in the bed of the Airbnb. This home was near a mountain. A feeling of clarity comes over oneself when staying in the upper-class homes of a mid-mountain-range housing tract, just above the ""waters"" of electric city lights. And because I am particularly picky about the type of Airbnbs I stay in, I felt I had chosen a quality one, like the one I stayed at back in Hollywood.

I clasped the mace at my side, its clip dangling outside the hem of my pocket. The house was big—at least 50 feet wide. I could tell its value was likely in the $800,000 or more vicinity. The window drapes were wide open. All the lights were on. I could see the kitchen, a den, and a table. A peculiar feeling came over me—one of vulnerability, as if, had this been a bad neighborhood, any would-be robber wouldn’t need much effort to stake the place out.

I had some Asian delights in my bag from Trader Joe’s—frozen dumplings and other simple foods I could throw together with a small wad of cash while on the go. I entered the home, used the microwave, cracked open a soda, and enjoyed my dinner.

Because the home was on the precipice of a mountain, I took my evening walk and enjoyed the crisp, fresh air. The neighborhood exuded an upper-class atmosphere. I took a detour down a street that, strangely, was not paved but lined with bricks—unusual. It had a ""Spanish"" feel, reminiscent of a private alleyway in Mexico. To the left and right, million-dollar ""villas"" stood settled. I gazed at the Mercedes-Benzes, Range Rovers, and BMWs lined in each driveway—the new American standard.

Night had already fallen, and I pretended I was in some obscure Mexican village, out for a night walk, enjoying the cool air, pondering existence and future dreams.

The next morning, I made coffee and met the owner of the home—an elderly lady of Latin descent. She was very kind and treated me, a stranger, like family. I thanked her, got into my car, and took the drive to Evergreen Cemetery.

Evergreen Cemetery in East Los Angeles is not your average cemetery. It’s a portal back in time. Many of the thousands of tombstones seem to resonate with daunting timelessness. They are not just tombstones; they are imposing, century-old shrines encapsulating the traditional, religious superstitions of old. If someone told me each one was chiseled by hand with a hammer and sickle a hundred years ago, I would believe them.

But beyond the crypts and tombs of this ancient cemetery lay the flavor of Mexican culture, permeating the air surrounding it and, ultimately, all of East L.A. I took my free stroll around the gravestones and tombs, noticing people exercising and engaging in leisure activities in this Halloween-esque, cryptic setting. Then, I set out in search of something I had been eager to find—guisados and sopes.

Guisados is a niche taco shop I had heard about through word of mouth. I won’t elaborate too much on the quality. I crammed my little car between two broken-down, dusty vehicles off Cesar Chavez and walked in. They specialize in ""trendy,"" avant-garde tacos designed for TikTok and Instagram culture. I ordered the sampler platter and an ice-cold sparkling water. The food was lukewarm. I wasn’t impressed.

I drove around the neighborhood for a while and eventually navigated my way to a ""tortilla factory"" on the corner of a few roads. It sounded like a sawmill when I walked in. The workers were busy turning cornmeal into dust, later to be shaped into the sopes I had mentioned earlier. This was their product. This was what they produced.

The young, attractive Latina girl at the counter was all smiles as I fumbled through some Spanglish to match her spanish. On my way back home, I took a bite out of a raw sope, forgetting that it needed to be fried before eating. It was bitter, hard, and I spit it out. Eventually, I learned. I began frying them properly and enjoying them. They were delicious.

Who’s wrong, who’s right and how to handle this from going forward.

It’s a family small business restaurant, up to 100 seats. Weekends we’re a full house. 

We have 2 servers, ( I’m one of ‘em) and a bartender and a host on the weekend only. ( host helps with cleaning the tables when super busy only) 

That’s all we have. No food runners or bar-backs. So us, the servers have to take orders, run the drinks, run the food and we have mandatory refill on bread for each table( can be up to 4 times each) 

My other coworker who’s a server has been saying that the bartender isn’t doing her job. She doesn’t polish the glasses that goes on the tables, she just gives them to us. When we’re super busy, she doesn’t help with the drinks( running them if she has some downtime) and there’s few instances where she’s kind of made her own rules on how and when to break down and etc. 

Not all tables order cocktails or drinks and barely do we have second or third rounds of drinks by the way. 
He’s been in my ear about this for past 2 weeks and it’s getting ridiculous because I don’t know if he’s right or the bartender is truly busy. I do see her peeling some stuff off some bottles and she polished her glasses ( for drinks only). When we’re slammed, she doesn’t provide water carafes either. 

She has said that she doesn’t want to make any tea or coffee neither and that’s something we’ve been doing as well. 

Who’s wrong here? I haven’t worked behind the bar so I can’t assume how busy she can be? She gets our shared tips, lesser percentage though so I’m just not sure if my coworker just complaining or he has legit reasons. ",0,1740903839.0,Serverlife,6,0.43,False

some more context can be found in my last post on here. TLDR on that post: my gf and i have not been in talking for the past 2 weeks after a big fight. i keep her updated and she does not because she blocks me on every form of communication. 

now my gf and i are back to talking a little bit throughout the day. a couple of days ago she asked me if we could talk but only if i truly reflected on what i want from this relationship and if i can prevent myself from getting frustrated or ruining the talking mood. i was honest with her and told her that i am not ready to talk but i still went over to her to reassure her that i still want to be with her. after that night, we have been texting very little throughout the day. i keep her updated and she keeps me updated a little bit. 

a little context about my business partner and i: i met him through my gf as he is the bf to my gf’s close friend. we get along well and we decided to start a business because during a trip a month ago, we got really into an idea and concept and we both want to flesh it out. we have been talking about starting it for almost a month now, and have slowly been working on starting up the company. we have both been itching to get started but our schedules are really busy so we havent found time to sit down again and have a meeting to truly get the ball rolling. my gf knows about this business as i have been telling her about it through the emails i send to her. today my business partner and i finally found time to meet today at 3:30 PM.

my gf was supposed to get coffee with a friend at 5:30 PM. we told eachother our plans yesterday. i had work from 8a-2:30p and then went home to freshen up and change. my business partner texts me and asks me if we could move the meeting time to 4:30. for more context, the plan was to meet in person at a cafe. i tell him that its okay and since i had an hour or so before meeting, i decided to get a quick workout in at the gym. when i get to the gym, my gf texts me and tells me that her plans were cancelled and that they might catch up over facetime or something. that was the last thing i heard from her regarding her hangout. i keep my gf updated about the gym and when i left to meet up with my business partner. we met up at 4:30 and i told my gf and she sends me “blocked.” 

i take it with a grain of salt and continue to cook up my business with him. we ended up working and talking until 8 PM and then we decide that we are both hungry, so we decided to get tacos. during this time i only told my gf when i arrived to the meeting and when i left to get food. i didnt tell her anything after leaving to get food as i didnt think it was too necesary. i get food with my business partner snd we end up talking a bit more until 9:30. we both go our separate ways and i EMAIL (we havent been texting this whole time just through email) her that i am done and am going to head home because my head was starting to hurt (i get really bad migraines from time to time and headaches are no better) and that i was physically and mentally exhausted from the day and havent had time to rest.

———im going to send the email convo

- ME: 

“””done with [FOOD]. we talked a lot about business and ideas and visions that we have for the company. i want to tell you all about it. its so cold. we sat outside and ate because it was busy inside and i dont have a jacket. i think it made my headache worse too. im so tired and my head is hurting even more now probably because of the cold. im gonna go home and rest. did you actually block me on here?”””

go fucking die in the cold. never living up to your word as always. yes you were blocked you fucking retard. imagine my disappointment when i check my blocked and NOTHING FROM YOU. i got too attached again. please go kill yourself. 

HAD A WHOLLEEE DAY FREE OFC YOU STILL DIDNT WANNA SEE ME. OF FUCKING COURSE. OFFFF FUCKING COURSE. DONT WANNA SEE ME DONT WNANA DRIVE ME DONT WANNA DO ANYTHING W ME ANYMORE HUH SINCE YOUR FUCKASS HAS NO DRIVE NOW. 

see. i blocked you bc i knew you wouldn’t keep me updated. of fucking course you act the way i expect you to. of fucking course you lie to my face again. again and again and again. wtv you already told me you’re used to not updating me and since you’re SOOOO USED TO NOT HEARING FROM ME YOURE NOT RVEN CURIOUS ANYMORE.

- HER:

”””more focused on him than me alright. that porn watcher over me ALRIGHT HAHAHAHA fuck you. yeah stay home faggot keep making excuses

you only wanna see me at the end of the day?? cool so you don’t even wanna be seen w me. you didn’t update me at [MEETING]. you didn’t update me at [FOOD]. you didn’t give me shit. not even what yg are doing every minute and what you ate. oh so you don’t wanna fucking share that shit w me alright OKAAAYYY HAHAHA fuck you. ykw since you hate me so much, ill just accept my date invitation. 

don’t fucking bother responding. oh poor mr migraine that stops him from even sending one teeny tiny text that COMMUNICATES what the HELL is going on

oh sure sit in the cold and stay out late. you did this to yourself. as fucking always. you’re fucking horrible to yourself and everyone around you. 

honestly just do not contact me unless you are ready to talk. again, once you are ready to SERIOUSLY talk and give me full, thoughtful answers throughout the entire conversation. without a hint of attitude or bad energy. I deserve your full attention since you never ever gave me that during a talk. the boundaries are confusing right now. idk if it hurts more being disappointed while knowing you lost drive and you basically don't have any obligation towards me, especially since you let go of those obligations so often, or being disappointed when we're knowingly tgt and you do have an obligation to me. due to us being in contact for the past 2 ish days, it confused the boundaries again for me. leading me to leave time in my day to see you and expect the same from you. leading me to immediately thinking of seeing you the moment my plans got canceled. leaving to me being ready to plan around my plans to be able to see you. leading me to expect you to update me. yet you didnt update me and didnt even try seeing me after work or before your meeting or even after. i'm too confused rn lmfao. if i dont hear from you a month from now, we're officially over. [MUTUAL] and i both agreed that you already had this past month to get your shit tgt and decide what you want. i gave you space for the past month and you are still not ready to talk lol. I actually have a free day next week, if things work out, maybe you'll be ready to talk by that day. if not, see you in less than a month or never again. I dont need this back and forth. at least thats what it feels like, you never even gave me an answer last night nor today about whether or not you wanted to be in contact before we talk. you do not respect me. you never have and it seems like you never will. you will receive the same treatment.

this is the same as a year ago with your film shit. you do your film shit and you do your stupid business with [BP] and suddenly, i'm not a part of your life anymore?? i do not exist anymore? does not matter what you say. you treat me as if i do not exist whenever you get caught up in your individual life or whenever smtg ""inconvenient"" happens like smtg not going the way you want to. you only get back to me when you want to be babied or when you're not busy anymore. you dont want to create a balance in your life to include me in it? fine. but thats your fucking downfall. you're setting yourself up to die alone. or maybe it is just me youre doing this to. you go out with a psychological cheater even tho you dont feel well rather than spend that time with me. alright. I understand it now. it is just me. you think your time is better spent with a douche bag rather than someone who gave everything to you. nice.”””
