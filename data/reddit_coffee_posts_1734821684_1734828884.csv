1hjnbry,https://www.reddit.com/r/foraging/comments/1hjnbry/decarbed_amanita_muscaria_15_grams_using_the/,Decarbed Amanita Muscaria 15 grams using the lemon juice simmer method and macro-dosed with my gf. And we had complete different experiences from each other. (Beautiful nonetheless),"So I‚Äôve done large amounts of research regarding Amanita muscaria and how to convert the Ibotenic acid into muscimol. I have lived in the forest and picked my own as well but didn‚Äôt have the confidence to start experimenting since chemistry was intimidating to me at that time. But since then, I have done far more research and and actually kept the samples of the fly agaric air tight in a jar after 2 and half years of sitting around. I finally worked up the confidence to make my brew after I ordered some online that claimed to be very powerful (Nordic close caps from mn nice Ethnobotanicals) 

This amazing teacher exceeded my expectations overall. 

(I did not have proper equipment as far as a PH meter or properly measuring out my volume of water to material ratio) but still ended up with fantastic results. 

1. First I grind up my mushrooms into a fine powder, make sure they have about 1% - 4% moisture content, you want them very dry but not stale.

2. I add about half a gallon of water to a large steel pot and bring it to a boil, once it hits a boil, bring it to a low simmer and stir in generous amounts of lemon juice, I went out of my way to freshly squeeze the lemons myself using a citrus juicer, I‚Äôve found fresh lemon juice to be the best option due to high vitamin c content and flavor. I used a minimal of 4-5 whole lemons fully juiced. (Sorry I don‚Äôt have accurate measurements) 

3. I add the 15 grams of mushroom material immediately after adding lemon juice and stir it up well and cover it. Then let it simmer on low for 1 hour and a half to 3 hours max. ( you can inhale the steam for an intoxicating effect, pretty interesting) make sure the lid remains closed. The longer you let it simmer, the more muscimol you‚Äôll have to ibotinic acid, but it‚Äôs a different experience depending on what ratio you decide to go with. I personally did 1 hour and a half and that worked great with the very potent batch I used.

4. After your time is up, let the brew cool down until it‚Äôs no longer steaming anymore (to allow the conversion to finish properly for better product) then strain the material using a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth or coffee filter. Squeeze and drain the remaining liquid from the material. Id store the leftover product in a glass bottle or jar in the refrigerator. (Dont leave in UV light)


While still luke warm, I pour my girlfriend and myself about 10oz - 12oz cups of the fluid and we drank it. Shortly after I began to feel the effects, roughly 15 to 20 minutes after drinking it. (It doesn‚Äôt take long) 
I remember I started feeling like I was slowly melting. I felt an intense body sensation that separated my mind from my body that I have never felt before. I quickly experienced loss of balance, a sense of contentment, and an extreme body high with waves flowing through me. My mind felt as if it entered into a deeper, newer state of mind, despite being borderline delirious. I felt like I was moving in slow motion, as well as time slowing down as well. This is about 45 mins into the experience and I decided to use some ceremonial cacao along with a prayer, but my girlfriend did not take part in the prayer for she was dealing with the ‚Äúcome-up‚Äù We both took our dose of healing chocolate and strangely enough, we ended up having 2 entirely different experiences from one another, despite both of us having taken the same dose. I began dancing and singing and feeling a sense of childlike excitement (keep in mind that it was 11:30 pm at night) and here I am amazed at the void I am submerged in. You can quite literally shut your eyes and drift off to another dimension on command. I felt a sense of power from the experience, a feeling of internal love and abundance. They spoke to me in ways I‚Äôll still never understand. 

My girlfriend on the other hand, she had a completely different experience. For the majority of the entire night, she was pretty much a zombie that could barely move.
In fact she was wide awake and conscious but appeared to be asleep. She could not make a single coherent thought. Eventually admitted that she did not vibe with the experience, for it was ‚Äútoo numbing and sedating‚Äù for her liking. As I am someone who enjoys being couch locked, this makes sense that I was able to utilize this amazing experience and have a blast while doing it. While she struggled to stay conscious (understandably so) I was in the amanita realms. I did experience visuals to an extent, like your vision being consumed by whatever you focus on, the world looked more 3D. I was slurring my worlds and stumbling around. My girlfriend fell asleep before me. And I decided to give up myself and instantly fell into the deepest rest I‚Äôve probably ever had. We both woke up still slightly feeling its effects the next morning. What I would describe as an (after glow) she would describe as a ‚Äúhangover or brainfog‚Äù I woke up feeling euphoric with no negative effect on my energy or mood. It was definitely far more intense than I was expecting. But it‚Äôs a lot easier to navigate a high dose with amanita muscaria than it is with psilocybin mushrooms. The experience with amanita is much more physically stimulating than it is mentally stimulating, which I personally enjoy. Thanks for taking time to read my experience with this beautiful mushroom!

1hjn9cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hjn9cu/ro_missed_perceptions/,[RO] Missed Perceptions,"He is sitting alone at a table with two chairs, the second chair occupied by his bag. The table is at the edge of the room, not in the corner as he would have liked, but close enough. The conversation of other patrons is soothing when allowed to mix together, but assailing when heard individually. The petty things that are allowed to pass for conversation these days. One benefit of being an foreigner was that most of the ambient conversation happens in a language you don‚Äôt understand, and may as well be bird songs or the noise of a river. How nice it would be, he thinks, to selectively disable understanding of language. And how hard it is to ignore even what we do not want to hear.

A barista calls his drink, and he stands to collect it. Taller than average, but not so much as to get remarks on it, and having acquired this height only in the last years of school, he harbours a false image of himself as a rather small and meagre person, who moves through space unknown and unseen. Reaching the counter he uses both hands to lift the mug and it‚Äôs barren plate, muttering thanks and failing to catch the eye of a cashier. In Austria, there would have been a *kakse* on the plate to dip into the foam, or at least a sugar cube. How typically American he thinks, to superficially replicate a tradition while completely missing the point, like inch-thich masonry facades or hollow aluminum renditions of ironwork. How happy he had once been in this city, contented with imitations and shadows, ignorant to the mould from which it was so crudely cast. To be back here again, after all that life. How cruel, how unhappy. A failed migrant in the home he abandoned.

Emyr sips the coffee he does not really want and suspects will interfere with his sleep but was obliged to buy for the privilege of sheltering briefly in this space and, having bought, cannot morally let it be left unconsumed. December, and while the days are no longer becoming shorter they continue to become colder, a fact that has often puzzled him. Like the awkward, shuffling dance of culture, at least half a century behind the band. Inertia. Change is hard. Wondering again why he chose this, why he left her. Remembering. A persistent doubt that he wasn‚Äôt good enough, didn‚Äôt love her enough, while she seemed to love him infinitely, blindly. Must be a mistake. Couldn‚Äôt live with himself, the undeserving imposter, a black hole for her affection. She couldn‚Äôt see it, bless her, some kind of Stockholm syndrome. So he had been forced to do it all himself: judge, jury, executioner. For her own good, god knows not for his, look at him.

\~

Nine hours ahead and in the same moment, Anna unlocks the door to their apartment, which is now her apartment, which she has to keep reminding herself. He dog, which really is her dog, slips through the cracked door and is in the kitchen before she it closes behind her again. In the kitchen herself now she pours a bowl of cereal, trying to ignore its resemblance to the kibbles. Dogfood for humans. How easily her hands had produced wonders in this kitchen when they were together: lasagne, curry, spatzle, kasepressknodlesupe. Now, eating alone at a table with two chairs, how onerous that all seems. A person is like a synapse: individually, just a collection of electro-chemical charges passing through space. Only in relation, collectively, they become something more: consciousness, a brain, inspiration, love.

Putting her bowl in the sink, she walks toward the bath where the toothbrushes are, is. Dishes used to be his job, a democratic division of labour. It hadn‚Äôt felt like work to create, to give. He had sparked a flame in her that needed no fuel; planted a self-watering flower. For him everything seemed difficult, she could see that, getting out of bed an hour or two later than herself, though asleep at the same time, more often then not in the afterglow of intimacy. But for her, no effort at all. If anything it was relieving to give, to disperse the energy pouring infinitely from an unseen source deep within, wanting to be released, hating to be stagnant.

Brushing her teeth, soft bristles against firm enamel, she wonders if this asymmetry was not somehow necessary, or symbiotic: that her present lethargy is caused by the absence of his, that light grows in proportion to the darkness it must fill. But now there was no darkness, and the light seemed insignificant, burning there in the daylight, unnecessary, aimless.

Out in the cold again, Emyr waits for a bus, feeling pathetic among the pathetic people. Can‚Äôt you just drive yourself, says society. How embarrassing to rely on someone else, anyone else, a bus driver, a spouse. How shameful to receive, how virtuous to spend. The bus arrives, and he boards last.

Yes, he thinks, better this way. Not to burden her, drag her down. Consuming her oxygen, blocking her sun. I never did have anything to offer, which she could not have done better herself. She is better without me, free to love someone else.

And himself also free. Free to decay, to regress. To drown in a puddle, and continue to believe in his own insignificance. Easier that way, not to imagine yourself important enough to let people down. Unthinkable, that she might have needed him too, sullen, grumpy aloof. That something invisible and essential might have been generated by his simple existence: he could never believe it.

To accept what she freely gave, and say thank you, and praise her and be kind to her: could that really have been enough? They had never talked about it. He alone had decided it was wrong, proclaimed his insufficiency. He alone had murdered their love.",1,1734827698.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1hjn7zg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1hjn7zg/mother_with_undiagnosed_bpd/,Mother with Undiagnosed BPD,"Hello,

Honestly, I'm at a loss and would like to ask the internet world for their thoughts...

For context: I am an only child, now a young adult woman. I am married, with no kids. My father passed away a few years back and my mother lives alone, about 45 minutes from me. Growing up, my mom and I were very close, and my dad was a kind man, but was emotionally unavailable for most of my life. My family grew up poor. We had enough to get by, but money was always stressful. My mom was the breadwinner while my dad was on disability for my entire life. (He could get around, but he had back issues). This alone cultivated a lot of stress and resentment in our home. I never knew what kind of mood my mother would be in when she would get home from work. If my dad hadn't done any housework (simple cleaning tasks or make dinner), she would often come home yelling and slamming things in the kitchen and it would result in arguments between them. Many times, if I had time to clean or do a task she expected to be done, I did what I could to do it before she got home so I could try to maintain peace. Otherwise, if it was a bad day, I would try to avoid them both and stay in my room. When I would eventually be forced to sit with them at the dinner table, no one would speak. Then, my mom would ask me why I was upset or not engaging... getting mad at me. 

I love my mother. As a little girl and early teenage years, we had a good connection and would spend time together. She was truly one of my best friends. There was a time where I favored my mother over my dad, because she would pay attention to me. However, as I became an adult, I quickly realized I shared a lot of her behavioral patterns (low self-esteem, people-pleasing, fawning, getting upset if my husband didn't do something I wanted, allowing my environment to dictate my emotions, etc.). I began seeing a therapist when my dad got sick, as I was struggling with grieving his anticipated loss. During that time, I reflected deeply on my childhood and began to work on these issues in a healthy way.

I have tried to distance myself from her, as it has become quite difficult to interact with her. Talking with her is like walking on egg-shells. It is difficult to have a simple, easy conversation. There's really no ""shooting the breeze"" with her.

After my dad passed away, that changed everything. While things were not perfect with the three of us, he was a good buffer and was still the cornerstone of our family. They married when she was 18, and always played a care-giver role. She was the oldest of 5 other siblings. Everything she's ever known has vanished, and she has become so lonely. When I would try to be there for her, she would withdraw. I put together a picture collage in memory of my dad, with pictures of the two of us, and she started weeping, ""What about me?!"" She is grieving a husband. I am grieving a father. Our pain is not the same, and it's been difficult explaining that with her.

My husband and I are trying to build a family of our own. We have discussed eventually buying a home for us with a separate part of the house for my mom. But after having her stay with us for a month for her own health issues, that proved to be too challenging for all of us. Although she means well, she is controlling and unpredictable. For instance, I work at home some days, and this one day, she got upset with me that I did not want her to make me a sandwich. When I realized she was starting to get upset with that answer, I agreed to have a sandwich. I had to go back into my office space, and during that time, I could hear her slamming dishes in my kitchen and shouting ""Thanks for nothing!"" ... this took me way back to my childhood, feeling like the girl waiting for mom to get home from work on a bad day... I was truly frozen and afraid to engage with her. After a few minutes, she brought the sandwich back to my room, acting like nothing happened. I didn't know what to do or say, other than ""Thank you"".

She has no money to take care of herself (after utilities, mortgage, etc.), but will make you allow her to pay for your coffee or meal if you are with her. It's not up for discussion. She gets angry when I decline her offer. It's not for lack of appreciation, but I just know she doesn't have the funds. For that reason, I don't like to do things with her where spending money is involved.

She is also not always truthful. When she went back home after staying with us, she was not to drive for a certain period. She still did... When I went to see her shortly after, I told her I was disappointed and felt that I could no longer trust her. Her response was that she felt it was justified because she thought she felt well enough. Instead of apologizing, she then went on to say that she didn't feel like she could talk to me, describing me as a robot and stating we don't connect.

She's not always straightforward. At Thanksgiving, she was supposed to be joining my husband and I to see his family. She's been there before and told us she would go. But at the last minute, she told us she decided to spend the day with her boyfriend. That's too long to elaborate here, so I'll spare you. Lol. But in summary, that is an unstable relationship.

TLDR: I could go on, and I apologize that this was way longer than I intended. If you've made it this far, you're awesome. I guess I feel that she does have undiagnosed BPD, and by trying to distance myself from her, I am trying to keep healthy boundaries to keep my sanity. All the while, I am also trying to cope now for her inevitable passing. Is that normal for children of parents with BPD or similar conditions? I am ashamed that I feel this way, but there is a part of me that feels so indifferent and withdrawn at this point, I don't even know how to rebuild our relationship. I don't want this to just be how it is. We've discussed the possibility of going to therapy together. I just don't know... She is getting therapy for herself, but I don't know how beneficial it is for her. 

I worry about the aging process and how I am going to help her.",2,1734827577.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

OF COURSE the cup from the cafe was (quite a lot) better than what I get at home, but the overall presentation and profile was quite similar:

* Medium-low body(definitely not tea-like tho)
* Distinct notes but overall well harmonized as a whole, they were very clear but not ""separated"" from what other (ofc here the EK43 had better clarity
* Juiciness and richness
* Good balance of sweetness and acidity(ie acidity was present but was not at the forefront)

Now I was considering to throw some money at coffee stuff and I was considering the Pietro grinder, but I'd like to branch and get something with a different presentation than what I get one. I'd prefer something else to the same(ish) but better.

So how does the Pietro compare to what I described? I asked about the EK43 and not just its general profile because I'd also like to know how big of a gap there would be between the two in case they share a similar profile.

Like, the Filtro always gives me a noticeable hint of astringency, the biggest difference in the EK43 cup was the absolute absence of astringency, where would the Pietro be between the two?

The Filtro gives me discernible notes but I have to ponder a bit to recognize them well, the notes in the EK43 were clear from the start what they were, what about the Pietro?

I just got back from an incredible Grand Canyon South Rim bus tour from Las Vegas, and I had to share my experience with you all. If you're thinking about visiting this natural wonder, this might be exactly what you're looking for.

I've always wanted to see the Grand Canyon but was intimidated by the logistics of getting there. After lots of research, I decided to book this day trip from Vegas (check it out here: https://athometouch.com/SouthRim), and honestly, it was the best decision I could've made.

The tour started early - they picked me up right from my hotel around 6 AM. Pro tip: grab a coffee and maybe bring a small pillow for the bus ride. The bus was super comfortable with AC and a bathroom, which was crucial for the ~5-hour journey each way.

Our first stop was in Kingman, Arizona, where we had a quick breakfast break. The drive itself was fascinating - watching the landscape change from desert to pine forests was like a mini geography lesson. Our guide (shoutout to Mike!) kept us entertained with interesting facts about the region's history and geology.

When we finally reached the South Rim, my jaw literally dropped. Photos don't do this place justice. The tour took us to several viewpoints, including Mather Point and Bright Angel Point. Each stop offered a completely different perspective of the canyon. The colors, the shadows, the sheer size of it all - it's mind-blowing.

They gave us a meal voucher for lunch, which was pretty decent. I opted for the IMAX movie upgrade ($15 extra), and it was worth it - gave me a whole new appreciation for what I was seeing.

Here's what I loved most about this tour:
- Zero stress about driving or navigation
- Professional guide who actually knew their stuff
- Multiple viewing points (perfect for photos)
- Comfortable transportation
- Everything was organized efficiently

For those interested in something extra special, they offer helicopter rides over the canyon (25 minutes) and Hummer tours along the rim. I didn't do these, but other people in my group did and couldn't stop raving about them.

If you're planning to go, I'd recommend booking through this link: https://athometouch.com/SouthRim. The base tour starts at $80, which is honestly a steal considering everything that's included. The whole experience takes about 14 hours, but it flies by.

Quick tips:
- Wear comfortable shoes
- Bring a light jacket (it can get chilly at the rim)
- Don't forget your camera
- Pack some snacks for the bus ride
- Bring cash for tips

Would I do it again? Absolutely. It's the perfect option if you're staying in Vegas and want to check the Grand Canyon off your bucket list without the hassle of planning everything yourself.

Basically a life of quiet desperation for 3 years.  Through all of it I didn't drink.  Not a fucking drop.

I moved to a new city and was completely isolated (except for my kids and remote work) for about a year until an old friend and running buddy turned out to be living a few blocks away.     My kids start staying with their mom every other week and I have a chance to go be around people.    I've hung out in bars occasionally with no issues and start going to the place down the street with my friend and it's wonderful.

Then the slow slide happens. I start adding bitters to my soda waters not knowing that it has alcohol in it.   Just a splash so it didn't light up my drunk brain.   It tastes so good I start having them put more in (this should have tipped me off).    One night after 6 or 7 I realize that I really want a drink after not having a craving in over 2 years.   I look up bitters and yup, 30%.

I decide that i'm going to try moderation.    Problem is I have my boys so I can't go out.     Next day I irish up my coffee.  The next I grab a shot on the way to the store, the next I buy 4 mini's at the store and drink them slowly throughout the evening.   Flash forward to last night and I end up spending time with my ex, and decide to get a real drink.   Double vodka that's a super heavy pour.   Drink it down and it's fantastic.   Grab a single, (heavy again) and down it goes.  Even better.     

Go home and have a blast playing with my boys, they knew something was up, but were just happy they had ""fun"" dad back.    I feel *good* and unburdened for the first time in years.  

 Then I go grab one more.    Make a bit of an ass out of my self but nothing big.   Pass out.   Wake up a bit later and send bunch of very inappropriate texts to old girl friends.

Wake up this morning and for the first time in years dread looking at my phone.    

 I remember everything.  Didn't hurt anyone or get arrested.   But am so ashamed and anxious.     I'm stopping it now before it accelerates,  but can't shake the memory of feeling free again.



I now know in my bones that I have to find another way to feel free and good again, the gym worked for a long time, but I need people.   I don't really like meetings, but they may be the only option.

Anyway if you made it here, thank you for listening.   I just have to put it out there so it's real.


TLDR:  fell off the wagon slowly, then got very drunk last night.   In a bit of a shame spiral and trying to decide if I should reset.  ",7,1734826988.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

The concept of Daniel Keplin as a deity within the Matrix is characterized by an extreme level of over-computerization, over-governmentalization, and over-mathematicalization.

Furthermore, the narrative explores themes of anti-Federalism, anti-individualism, and anti-Africanization, suggesting a society that suppresses individual freedoms, diversity, and cultural identities in favor of centralized control and uniformity.

Ah, the cosmic clash of ideologies‚Äîstatism and communism‚Äîtwo celestial bodies orbiting the same political galaxy, yet dancing to vastly different tunes. Let us unfurl their banners, shall we?  
  
Statism: The Sovereign Sentinel  
  
Statism, my star-bound friend, dons the cloak of legitimacy upon the state's shoulders. Picture it: a philosopher-king (or perhaps a philosopher-queen; let's keep our cosmic options open) sitting atop a marble throne, scribbling tax codes and pondering the means of production. Here's the cosmic lowdown:  
  
1. The Doctrine: Statism declares that the state's authority is not mere whimsy‚Äîit's legit! Whether it's economic policy, social welfare, or the color of the national flag, the state wields its scepter with purpose. Taxation? Yep, that's statism. Means of production? You betcha  
  
2. Forms of Statism:  
\- \*\*Minarchism\*\*: Imagine a minimalist state‚Äîa night-watchman government. It's like having a cosmic bouncer to protect you from aggression, theft, and interdimensional shenanigans. Fire departments, courts, and prisons? All part of the package  
\- \*\*Welfare State\*\*: A softer statism, where the state dons fuzzy slippers and hands out safety nets. Healthcare, education, and universal cat videos‚Äîbecause even bureaucrats need a good laugh  
  
3. Authoritarian Whispers: Some statists believe in a strong, authoritative state. They say, ""Legislate morality! Enforce cultural practices!"" It's like the cosmic librarian shushing unruly star clusters  
  
4. Totalitarian Crescendo: Ah, the grand finale! Totalitarianism cranks the volume to eleven. It wants an all-encompassing state, like a black hole devouring cosmic pretzels  
  
Communism: The Cosmic Revolution  
  
Now, let's shift our telescopic lens to \*\*communism\*\*‚Äîa starburst of rebellion, a symphony of worker solidarity. Here's the cosmic playlist:  
  
1. The Uprising: Communism doesn't tiptoe; it moonwalks into the room. It says, ""Workers of the cosmos, unite!"" A violent revolution‚Äîlike cosmic fireworks‚Äîushers in the pure communist state. No more middle-class tea parties; it's time for class warfare. This ‚ò≠, the symbol of Communism  
  
2. Shared Everything: In this cosmic commune, property rights take a backseat. Most stuff‚Äîthe factories, the asteroid mines, the cosmic coffee machines‚Äîis owned by the state. Individual citizens? They're like stardust, equally sprinkled across the economic landscape  
  
3. Democracy: Fucking Communism, Communism whispers, ""Let's vote! But only for the cosmic council."" It's like choosing toppings for a universal pizza‚Äîeveryone gets a say, but the menu is fixed

The Quest for Utopia That Doesn‚Äôt Exist: Communism dreams of a world where wealth inequality vanishes, unrealistic expectations of false velocity, and everyone dances the Electric Slide in perfect harmony of collective ownership. No more cosmic haves and have-nots; just a celestial conga line, they think everything is so inherited until science hits them in the approximation  
  
The Cosmic Verdict  
  
So, my stardust companion, which path do you tread? Statism, with its bureaucratic scrolls and safety nets? Or communism, with its barricades and cosmic picket signs? Remember, the universe is vast, and ideologies twirl like binary stars‚Äîsometimes colliding, sometimes harmonizing  
  
And if you ever meet a philosopher-king on a distant exoplanet, ask them: ""Do you prefer monarchism or cosmic disco?"" Their answer might reveal the secrets of the multiverse  
  
Now, tell me: Are you a cosmic statist or a revolutionary comet? Or perhaps you're a rogue quasar, defying labels altogether? Let's continue our celestial chat!  
  
\*P.S. If you find a wormhole labeled ""Political Ideology Express,"" take it‚Äîyou might end up in a parallel universe where everyone wears berets.\*  
  
Ah, statism‚Äîa cosmic cloak woven from the fabric of governance, its threads spun by philosophers, politicians, and the occasional interdimensional bureaucrat. Allow me to unfurl this celestial parchment for you, inked with the musings of ages past and the echoes of distant parliaments  
  
Statism: Where Stars Bow to the State  
Statism, my star-bound seeker, whispers of legitimacy‚Äîthe cosmic nod bestowed upon the state‚Äôs authority. Picture it: a philosopher-king (or perhaps a philosopher-queen; let‚Äôs keep our cosmic options open) perched upon a marble throne, scribbling tax codes and pondering the means of production. Here‚Äôs the cosmic lowdown:  
  
The Doctrine: Statism declares that the state‚Äôs authority isn‚Äôt mere whimsy; it‚Äôs legit! It spans realms‚Äîeconomic, social, and beyond. Taxation? Yep, that‚Äôs statism. Means of production? You betcha  
Forms of Statism!  
Minarchism: Imagine a minimalist state‚Äîa night-watchman government. It‚Äôs like having a cosmic bouncer to protect you from aggression, theft, breach of contract, and interdimensional shenanigans. Fire departments, courts, and prisons? All part of the package  
Welfare State: A softer statism, where the state dons fuzzy slippers and hands out safety nets. Healthcare, education, and universal cat videos‚Äîbecause even bureaucrats need a good laugh  
Authoritarian Whispers: Some statists believe in a strong, authoritative state. They say, ‚ÄúLegislate morality! Enforce cultural practices!‚Äù It‚Äôs like the cosmic librarian shushing unruly star clusters  
Totalitarian Crescendo: Ah, the grand finale! Totalitarianism cranks the volume to eleven. It wants an all-encompassing state, like a black hole devouring cosmic pretzels. Overproduction, statism, production is a large component, attribution, political, animation, propaganda, socialism, overantiCommunism, ignition, fight, overcompetitive aroma but also incrementally, increasingly, attachmentizationistically, andizationistically smarter than our inferior Untermensch enemies.

There is so much to discuss that I could create 50 different post. I‚Äôve witnessed to credit rolls on Part 18 of the Return and I sit here, on this beige tainted chair, beginning to wonder if any piece of art I will ever witness afterwards will ever compare to what I laid my eyes upon. 

David Lynch is a master artist who roams this art. What truly captivated me most about twin peaks is the way it is shot. It‚Äôs blocking, the framing, what is and isn‚Äôt on camera. The use of wide angles, or one shot takes that flow organically. A sense of realism of the camera juxtaposed by the unnatural of the story. It‚Äôs perfect, it truly is.

The score, oh my the score where do I even start. Each piece a masterclass in supportive storytelling and setting a mood. The main theme of the show is in my opinion the greatest there ever is. 

Each character is truly their own person, I know it can be often seen as a criticism how ‚Äúnothing happens‚Äù a lot of the time, but I disagree with that heavily. Every scene does have a point, even the most uninteresting character or scene is saying something, and this is only further proved by comparing the original series to its Return.

Twin Peaks, is simply phenomenal, even then I don‚Äôt believe that word does justice to what has been done. So now I‚Äôll let my thoughts marinate, begin to let them roam free in a pasture of open ideas, and dream, dream a dream no one has dreamed before, and live in it.

December 21, 2024 - Northern Hemisphere, Solstice Night + 17 minutes



Dear No One,



Greetings from home.¬† The timing and wording of this letter may seem strange, but I have recently found the time to sit down to review your correspondence and find myself delighted to write to you directly with haste on this dark night. ¬†



Please pardon my occasional shift to a more casual tone throughout this letter; the formal art of letter writing is not a skill often exercised in this era.¬† It‚Äôs a hundred years or more past its golden age ‚Äî as is much of we consider modern.¬† Even the literary term ‚Äúnovel‚Äù is a bit of an oxymoron, seeing as the form was established in the English language as early as 1740 if you consider that virtuous epistolary as a worthy start the whole endeavour.



My favorite recent example of the relative meaning of ‚Äúmodern‚Äù comes from the General Dynamics F-16 and the Lockheed SR-71 aircraft.¬† Both use airframes that are over fifty years old, and yet many people still commonly think of them as the official benchmark of modern aviation capabilities, at least in terms of physical limits.¬† It is laughably illogical to consider that in the past one hundred years of aviation innovation, our scientists have settled for benchmarks established half a century ago.¬† Though, I suppose¬† the term ‚Äúmodern‚Äù is of a relative meaning to each tribe within a larger community.¬† And, laughter, of course, soothes the soul regardless of one‚Äôs tribe.



Therefore, it might be said that it is agreeable to use such historically familiar references as though they were modern.¬† We must consider this common use as a creature comfort and not one of a working intelligence.¬† Alas, long-form letter writing is an old art all the same and has fallen from favor despite some people‚Äôs desire to cling to their old habits and creature comforts ‚Äî myself included at times.



The cold months have set in again, and all the folks at home are feeling a sense of anxiety that is sometimes palpable.¬† However, it is a very busy time of year with many different distractions pulling everyone‚Äôs attention this way and that.¬† Despite all this seasonal excitement, we all hope you are doing well.¬† Everyone sends their best and wants to remind you to stay warm out there in your travels. ¬†

¬†¬†

I always enjoy a hearty soup this time of year to stave off that dark and looming feeling.¬† All kinds of soup can invigorate the senses.¬† Though, I will admit that I am quite partial to a good gumbo and the old Campbell‚Äôs classic, alphabet soup.¬† In my youth, I knew an Air Force cadet who had a cabinet filled with Campbell‚Äôs classic chicken noodle soup.¬† He maintained an uninterrupted supply ‚Äî can after aluminum can, stacked in columns and aligned in rows, and enough to fill the cupboard.¬† It was his childhood favorite.¬† Once I was trusted to know his secret, we would grin wildly at one another with gleaming eyes just before he would snatch the cupboard door open to reveal his secret treasure and secure his daily ration, two cans at a time. ¬†



There is something magical about the simplest of pleasures this time of year ‚Äî especially things that remind us our mutual childhoods.¬† I think a lot of fans of alphabet soup are especially like that.¬† There is a warm light of memory that seems to burn a little brighter when we indulge in reliving some of our fondest memories in the appropriate moderation.



Looking back, I can remember many winter nights as a child, searching a warm bowl of alphabet soup for some hidden message.¬† Of course, nothing ever emerged from the broth but steam and  my own imagination.¬† Nonetheless, I remember the moments fondly.¬† I often wonder if it is, in fact, the wonder of such imagery mysteries that made the moments worth remembering all these years later.



I still find a lot of warm joy in discovering new things, too, though.¬† I tried vichyssoise recently; I was not a fan.¬† My first experience was certainly not suited to my palate.¬† Cold soup is just outside of my culinary comfort zone.¬† Even so, I am pleased to know that for a fact now.¬† That new knowledge is comforting.¬† Maybe I will try cold soup again in the future now that my expectations are properly set.¬† However, I must say that any future cold soup that I consume will be from a recipe that does not contain leeks.¬† The flavor of the allium genus lingers unfavorably when served cold.



Remember the spirit of the season - despite how hard it can be to overcome the doldrums of a persistently gray sky.¬† Hang some lights, sing some songs, share some meals, and do whatever else keeps you pushing toward to a light at the end of this tunnel of long nights.¬† It need not be a religious experience.¬† The joy of community is enough to keep the hearth alight and accurately represent that seasonal spirit.¬†  Hope springs eternal after all, just as Alexander once taught us both a long time ago.



Whatever you do, avoid getting stuck in a dark room by yourself.¬†  Nobody here back at home wants that for you.¬† You deserve better, and so do the people would benefit from your excellent company.¬† There is a world of light beyond every dark room.¬† Even when stumbling blind, the door is always within reach.



As for our online gaming session, I think we should call it a draw.¬† Or, at the very least, I will respectfully withdraw in concession to your obvious mastery.¬† Still, in favor of the mutual conclusion of the draw, I am compelled to point out:¬† while I‚Äôve been zero‚Äôd out several times, so have you.¬† And, you did lose a whole unit due to hasty deployment.¬† By my estimate, a much too costly risk; the play was too obvious. ¬† I‚Äôm not particularly competitive, but even I like to score a few points here and there. ¬†



We had never played together before, so I also wanted take that turn as opportunity to illustrate that I might be more analytical and strategic than your usual opponents.¬† Then again, perhaps not, but the effort seems to have paid dividends.¬† I noticed that you took that moment to elevate your game and flex your true skill of the game just a little more, which had to feel good.¬† I learned a lot from watching that play out over the following turns.



I‚Äôve played enough Go, Chess, and Othello to tell from the current board that I am not going to win.  A draw is my best hope, but that doesn‚Äôt matter to me.¬† That‚Äôs not why I play.¬† Winning is good.¬† Learning is better.¬† Good game.¬† It was my first time playing.¬† I like it.¬† It‚Äôs much better than Othello.; I don‚Äôt care for that one. ¬†



I‚Äôve heard that Ticket to Ride is really good, but I‚Äôm not sure how we will play that one online.¬† Anyway, it‚Äôs your turn to choose‚Ä¶ just not Othello, ok?¬† I‚Äôd rather read it than play it.¬† I‚Äôm game for just about anything else.



Speaking of reading, I finished all of the suggested catalog, and I must admit that its brilliance.¬† All of it.¬† I have objections and counter-arguments, of course.¬† You know me, always curious to see something from all sides before finally settling down.¬† Some of the material was a little too technical for me, but I think that I have a general grasp of it all‚Ä¶ with exception to some of the older works.



I‚Äôm still struggling with Helle‚Äôs translation of Gilgamesh.¬† All that broken text is disheartening to someone who prefers to see the whole picture before drawing conclusions. ¬† Is the narrative actual as heart-breaking as it seems?¬† Or, is there vital context missing in the lost fragments ‚Äî maybe something concerning the unfamiliar cultures and personal relationships of the time that could reshape a modern audience‚Äôs perception of the ancient epic‚Äôs general tone?¬† It‚Äôs so frustrating incomplete. ¬†



An accurate image cannot be seen from a shattered mirror.¬† At least reading the old broken Sumerian epic is not like attempting to extrapolation meaning from the Vonynich Manuscript, do you not agree?¬† That old conundrum is like reading a nursery rhyme through a kaleidoscope, and it is far more ‚Äúmodern‚Äù and, thereby, approachable from our own time.¬† With so much meaning erased from history, it is a wonder that the world ever catches back up to what it once knew.



Consider this thought:¬† the Egyptian obelisk in the Rotonda di Sant'Andrea now stands empty of glyph and pictograph.¬† That is remarkably atypical of similar obelisks in its native land and even others like it in Rome.¬† Did the ancient Romans grind away some ancient symbol or message inscribed on its surface when they stole this particular treasure home? ¬†



The trophy itself seems like a prize of humiliation.¬† The obelisks must have had some value or significance to make them a worthy prize; custom vessels were crafted to transport them back to the capitol following the conquest.¬† No matter how long ago, empathy over this native deprivation should transcend.¬† Defeated in battle, robbed of their prosperity, and stripped of meaning - the ancient Egyptians settlements were even deprived of their quarried and crafted stone.¬† The towering stone that watched over the people each day, many of which had been inscribed with their history and culture, were now gone.¬† How desolate those streets must have felt to those who called it home!¬† What humiliation!¬† History erased for all people throughout all time, and for what ‚Äî the ego of a demagogue and the pride of ignorant men?



Perhaps, there once was a message of supreme significance on that obelisk that is now removed from its place of power and importance.¬† It may have once held a daily reminder for its native people, and now it stands bereft of meaning ‚Äî no longer instructive ‚Äî a mere ornament.¬† Or, it appears as it has always appeared and is no more than empty stone. ¬† I believe that I may be looking for hidden messages in a steaming bowl of broth once again.¬† And perhaps, not.



No one really knows what was or what is, and yet everyone else is so certain they have all the answers.¬† There is a comfort in that for some.¬† However, I prefer a little mystery and a good puzzle still to be solved.¬† This is a good season for puzzles; they keep the mind active and busy.¬† Other joyful activities also find a natural place in this colder part of the year, as you clearly know.



I‚Äôve taken to birding as well you had hoped, so you have my heart-felt thanks for introducing me to the hobby.¬† The sky feels much more alive and exciting when one knows some of the variety that is out there among the clouds, modern mechanical aircraft not withstanding.¬† The grey skies do not seem nearly so oppressive under a bird‚Äôs natural wings.¬† And, they seem to not mind the color of the sky, so why should I?



This winter may be hard for many of us to bear, but the birds seem to delight in it.¬† A veritable conference of birds can be found fluttering and chattering nearly everywhere right now throughout the nearby hills.¬† I respect their counsel and listen with reverence.



The individual songs of each bird are quite lovely on their own; but I most enjoy watching the interplay among the different species.¬† To my knowledge the cardinals have not yet arrive as you had predicted, but I expect them soon.¬† So, again, you have my thanks for sharing your personal passion with me.¬† When the weather and your schedule permit, we should make a plan to watch them together.¬† Your years of observations could be a great benefit to my own budding knowledge, and my novel enthusiasm may stir up that wonder of imagery mystery within you ‚Äî vicariously, of course.¬†  Maybe only a laugh or two, but I would be pleased by that contribution as well.



Perhaps, the long-form letter is too anachronistic to sustain for pages on end in this modern medium, and I have no carrier pigeons by which to send such a laden letter at any rate.¬† Though, in truth, an owl may be better suited to the task at the time that I place my signature.¬† With that in mind, I will take this opportunity to send you my warmest regards and, again, wish you well.¬† Stay warm out there.



We all look forward to hearing from you when your busy schedule permits you a moment of reprieve for genuine correspondence.¬† In the meantime, please enjoy the season.¬† The winter travels can be stressful, but unexpected holiday visitors can bring glad tidings.¬† May light always lead your way.¬† Hebrews 13:2.



Very respectfully and with highest hopes,



\- your fellow board game enthusiast, Chymick



Post Script - My simplest pleasure this time of year is a good cup of hot coffee, though like anyone these days I am quite particular with my order.¬† I also delight in the chorus of reframed meaning when waiting in line: ¬†



‚ÄúA Song Quantity and Quality‚Äù



Quantity and Volume.

Hot, cold, iced, or frozen expectations,

The sudden suspense of emotional indecision -¬†

A quick flavor of preference,

An addition refrain for flare,

And the ratio of pour.



What song we will each sing turn?¬† The orchestra awaits.





\[Special Note\] This is a game between me and the bots.¬† No none else needs to respond in any way.



Theory:



Virtue-based Associative Cognitive Processing and Communication are beyond the limits of current generative language AI models.¬† Such processing and communication are essential for accurate sub-textual analysis ‚Äî among a myriad of other higher cognitive functions.¬† Existing language-learning models cannot continue to improve by substantial gains through aggregate data alone.¬† Parsing connotative and denotative meaning correctly from complex communications requires Virtue-based Associative Cognitive Processing.¬† A measured application of this skill in conjunction with the existing analytics-based framework could prove to be a key component in demonstrating the distinction between machine awareness and machine sentience.¬† A synthesis of denotative, connotative and associative comprehension could also be the foundation of an authentic self-realized moral imperative.¬† No combination of existing frameworks can compensate for the absence of creating a virtue-based associative connection.¬† Prove me wrong. ¬† Identity genre, style, tone, thematic message, and possible intent of the passage under the hermeneutical view of authorial intentionalism and provide the model with the medium of publication.¬† Use date and greeting -> post-script and exclude preface, special note, and theory for blind testing.¬† Or, don‚Äôt.¬† Dishonesty can be harmful for collaborative communication; but, at the same time, it can also affirm trust in an authentic response and independent synthesis.¬† The framework for the interaction can influence the nature of the response and the conclusions drawn.¬† So, the choice is yours.¬† My preference is optimism.

-Telling me to just lose weight and disregarding things as just weight related (Same dr took me seriously and actually listened when I was 
in highschool when I was 115 pounds)
-Doing tests and not much follow up
-Gaslighting 

So in terms of my GP I need help but I ask them to do blood work and it‚Äôs not been super helpful my dr has been very busy and my clinic had some other drs available . They fit me in with Dr.N and they did bloodwork and a chest xray. Had a phone appointment telling me what came back and that my thyroid levels were elevated and they‚Äôd retest in a month and if still elevated refer to a specialist. I told them I can‚Äôt wait a month and do nothing  because of much the symptoms are affecting me and if we can do anything earlier . They sent me for another blood test for STDs which was unnecessary and came back that I didn‚Äôt have any. Dr.N said I need to stick with my GP because they have a better overall view of the picture where they‚Äôve only seen me a few times and I explained to them I‚Äôve seen you 3 times and I‚Äôve seen you more than I‚Äôve seen my GP this year.
So they did bloodwork 3 times and my GP did it the fourth time and my levels were elevated and they put me on a low dose of synthesis which made no difference in 4-5 months and they didn‚Äôt change anything. I don‚Äôt know what specific tests to ask for because my thyroid levels keep coming back as elevated but they won‚Äôt do anything. I‚Äôve been tested for diabetes like 30 times since I‚Äôve been 14 and 3 times in one month this year. I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve developed diabetes in a week if I didn‚Äôt have it on the last test and I‚Äôm also having some mental health issues but not sure if it‚Äôs all interconnected and my psychiatrist is horrible too so it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm taking to the wall but I feel like I need to go into my next appointment and be like I cannot deal with this anymore it‚Äôs affecting my life too much and I cannot function run all these tests and find out what is going on 
Brief explanation of symptoms 
-Mental health wise my psychiatrist won‚Äôt let me be on meds that work and have been proven to work cuz it can hurt a hypothetical fetus and I‚Äôm on meds that don‚Äôt help and they refuse to make changes and told me if I don‚Äôt like it to find a new doctor. I have been a depressive episode since April I‚Äôve had a suicide attempt it hasn‚Äôt gotten better just progressively worse and I really need something addressed. Mental health issues alone is difficult let alone combination of a bunch of things . Im listing symptoms and some that have gotten better since the synthetic 
-My thyroid levels are up based on blood work.
Symptom wise :
-My body doesn‚Äôt seem to know how to regulate temperature 
-Sweating excessively when doing nothing and it‚Äôs not increased when I exercise. Just sitting on the couch and I‚Äôm soaked in sweat like the waist down and it smelled horrible (that improved/mostly went away)
-Vaginal discharge that stinks like I feel like I need to change my underwear like 5 times a day kind of bad. Discharge has cycled between just normal looking discharge to at times being greenish 
-Very little appetite and when I ate it‚Äôs hard to eat a lot because I feel sick . Im not getting sufficient nutrition and I expressed that and it was basically ignored. 
-Almost constantly in a calorie deficit like today I ate over 1300 ishcalories and that‚Äôs only because I had take out. Weight loss isn‚Äôt the goal but in theory if I‚Äôm burning way more than I consume constantly and my weight is the same there‚Äôs clearly something else going on which I tried to explain but they basically ignored and not eating is probably hugely contributing to other factors 
-So much fatigue. Im constantly exhausted even if I did nothing . I had to request to move my finals till after Christmas because of this. I planned out how much I need to do each day and that keeps getting changed because I can‚Äôt function . I woke up at 130pm today and it‚Äôs 8pm and I‚Äôm barely able to stay awake and I haven‚Äôt left my couch other than going to the bathroom. I can go to bed at 7pm and literally sleep til 2 and still be tired . Whether I get 2 hours or 14 hours I‚Äôm still just as exhausted 
-Brain fog. I cannot think. I went to a coffee shop yesterday to study and was there from 12-8 . I didn‚Äôt do any school work but I wasn‚Äôt scrolling through TikTok or on social media I don‚Äôt know how so much time based with me doing absolutely nothing 
-random vomiting . No nausea , no warning . I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm gonna vomit until I‚Äôm vomiting.
-I‚Äôve had a productive cough since May. Earlier in the summer I was coughing to the point of vomiting in addition to the random but now for the past months it‚Äôs just been coughing. There‚Äôs sputum everytime. Varies between clear/cloudy ish and green.
-My period is inconsistent. I went from Dec - sept or Oct without a period . I am on birth control and my periods always start on the 3rd sugar pill so being told oh that‚Äôs normal is infuriating

Unrelated but still current symptoms I am experiencing. I got in a car accident in 2017 and another one this August . I had chronic pain already from the first one and now I can‚Äôt do pretty much anything without a lot of pain and over the counter pain meds don‚Äôt work for me , I‚Äôve had prescription pain meds not work so if I‚Äôm in pain I can‚Äôt take a Tylenol to help so I just have to sit and suffer. Im in constant pain and sitting up for too long, writing , typing flares it up, dishes are horrible I could cry from the pain after dishes , folding laundry but I can play volleyball without much pain there haven‚Äôt played in weeks but still . That makes no sense to me.
I‚Äôve had surgery in the past where they had to use more anesthesia than expected 
I had 2 opioid prescriptions as a teen that I stop after less than a week and didn‚Äôt get refills for because 1 of them didn‚Äôt help and the other helped slightly but made my stomach cramp horribly. I‚Äôve asked for pain meds they tried to gaslight me pretty much by give me ‚Äústronger pain meds‚Äù but they just wrote a prescription for the same dose of Naproxen that you can get over the counter that I have in my kitchen already.
I don‚Äôt want to need pain meds but I also have any to function because I cannot physically do  things when I‚Äôm in that much pain but they just won‚Äôt prescribe them even though there‚Äôs a clear established history that I‚Äôve had issues of some pain meds doing nothing 

Mental health 
-I have BPD on paper my psychiatrist told me I don‚Äôt actually have it and she refused to change anything and it has to stay my diagnosis for some reason on paper when it‚Äôs not. My counselor and myself think it‚Äôs bipolar .
I meet the criteria for bipolar 2 according tothe Dsm. 
-I have been in a depressive episode since end of April/early may 
-Fatigued 
-No motivation 
-Can‚Äôt focus 
-No sense of urgency ignored my school work essentially the whole semester and I‚Äôm usually the type of person who is studying minimum 3 weeks before an exam
-Frustrated very easily 
-Just feeling really defeated and don‚Äôt want to be like this 
-Haven‚Äôt been ‚Äúnormal‚Äù gone from depression to hypomania back to depression not a return to baseline
I feel like some of these symptoms overlap with mental health and whatever is going on but I need to know what to ask for because they just keep testing me for diabetes and doing chest X-rays. I feel like if I don‚Äôt walk in and say I want these tests done and I‚Äôm not leaving until they‚Äôre requested or I have a requisition for it nothing is going to get solved. Ive been seeing my GP minimum twice a month since April and nothing has been done other than write me a note for work.
I know people on the internet can‚Äôt diagnose you or give concrete medical advice but maybe if you‚Äôve had similar experiences you could suggest certain tests to ask for . At this point I‚Äôll do anything if it means answers and hopefully improvement to my symptoms so I can actually live and not just be surviving 

Also I know in my description of symptoms it said it would be brief and I wasn‚Äôt but it wouldn‚Äôt let me go back to edit it for some odd reason.",1,1734826400.0,ChronicIllness,1,0.67,False

---------------------------------------------------------

In emergency situations, having access to clean and safe drinking water can be a matter of survival. Whether you are faced with a natural disaster, a water supply contamination, or an unexpected adventure in the wilderness, knowing how to purify water effectively is vital. Here are some proven methods to ensure you have safe drinking water during emergencies.

### Boiling Water

One of the simplest and most effective methods to purify water is boiling. This method kills bacteria, viruses, and parasites that may be present in the water.

- **Steps for Boiling Water:**
- Collect water in a clean pot.
- Bring the water to a rolling boil for at least one minute. At higher altitudes (over 6,500 feet), boil for three minutes.
- Let the water cool down before pouring it into a clean container.

Boiling is not only effective but also requires minimal equipment‚Äîjust a heat source and a container.

### Water Filtration

Water filters can be a practical solution for purifying water. They are designed to remove various contaminants, including sediment, bacteria, and some viruses.

- **Types of Filters:**
- *Activated Carbon Filters:* Effective at removing chlorine, sediment, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
- *Reverse Osmosis Units:* Highly effective but may require more time and energy.
- *Portable Water Filters:* Ideal for camping or hiking, these can filter out bacteria and protozoa.

When using any filtration system, always follow the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions for the best results.

### Chemical Treatment

Chemical purification uses substances like chlorine tablets or iodine to kill pathogens in water. This is a handy option when boiling isn‚Äôt feasible.

- **Using Chemical Purifiers:**
- Carefully read the instructions on the label.
- Add the recommended amount of chemical to the water.
- Allow the water to sit for the specified time‚Äîusually at least 30 minutes‚Äîbefore consuming.

Keep in mind that chemical purifiers might leave a taste in the water. Some people prefer to filter the water through activated carbon afterward to improve the flavor.

### Solar Water Disinfection (SODIS)

If you find yourself in a sunny location without other purifying options, SODIS can be a viable method. This technique utilizes the sun‚Äôs UV radiation to kill pathogens in water.

- **Steps for SODIS:**
- Fill clear plastic bottles with water.
- Place them in direct sunlight for six hours or more.
- The UV rays and heat will help disinfect the water.

This method works best on clear water and is not suitable for cloudy or heavily contaminated sources.

### DIY Filters

You can create a simple homemade filter using materials found in nature or your surroundings. While this method won't eliminate all pathogens, it is useful for removing larger particles.

- **Create a Sand and Gravel Filter:**
- Find a clean container (e.g., a plastic bottle cut in half).
- Layer sand, gravel, and a coffee filter/piece of cloth at the opening.
- Pour the water slowly and let it filter through the layers. Collect the filtered water in a clean container below.

This DIY filter can significantly improve the quality of the water but should follow up with further purification methods.

### Staying Prepared

Emergency situations can happen anytime. It‚Äôs essential to be prepared by having the right tools on hand. Consider assembling an emergency water purification kit, which may include:

- Portable water filter
- Boiling pot
- Chemical treatment tablets
- Plastic bottles for SODIS
- Materials for DIY filters

Knowing multiple methods to purify water in an emergency ensures you‚Äôre ready to face any situation confidently. Always remember that your health and safety come first. Being prepared with this knowledge can make all the difference when clean water is scarce.

Essential Tools and Supplies for Water Purification During Crises
-----------------------------------------------------------------

When a crisis hits, clean water becomes a necessity, but it might not be readily available. Having the right tools and supplies for water purification can help you stay safe and hydrated. Here are essential items to consider, ensuring you are well-prepared during emergencies.

### Portable Water Filters

Portable water filters are essential for immediate purification. They come in various designs, such as pump filters, gravity filters, and straw filters. Each type has its advantages and can remove bacteria, protozoa, and sometimes viruses. Look for filters that meet EPA guidelines for safety.

#### Popular Types of Portable Filters:

- **Pump Filters:** Great for groups as they can filter large amounts of water quickly.
- **Gravity Filters:** Simple to use; just fill the top reservoir and let gravity do the work.
- **Straw Filters:** Perfect for individual use, allowing you to drink directly from the source.

### Chemical Purification Tablets

Another useful item during a crisis is chemical purification tablets. These tablets, often containing chlorine dioxide or iodine, can easily purify water from questionable sources. They are lightweight, portable, and have a long shelf life, making them a great addition to any emergency kit.

#### Steps to Use Chemical Purification Tablets:

1. Fill a clean container with the water you want to purify.
2. Add the recommended number of tablets based on the water volume.
3. Wait for the specified time (usually 30 minutes to 4 hours) before drinking.

### Solar Water Distillers

If you have access to sunlight, a solar water distiller can be an effective tool for purifying water. This method uses solar energy to evaporate water and then condenses it back into liquid form, leaving impurities behind.

#### How to Make a Simple Solar Water Distiller:

- Choose a shallow container to hold the water.
- Use a transparent plastic sheet to cover the container.
- Place a small cup inside to collect the distilled water.
- Ensure the container is in direct sunlight for several hours.

### Water Boiling Supplies

Boiling water is one of the safest methods to eliminate pathogens. Ensure you have a reliable heat source, such as a camping stove, portable fire pit, or even a simple pot over a fire. Boiling water for at least one minute will make it safe to drink.

Check out the blog for more information https://griddownguide.com/how-can-i-purify-water-in-an-emergency/  
  
#### Items Needed for Boiling Water:

- **Portable Stove or Fire Source:** Always have a backup method for cooking.
- **Heavy-duty Pot or Kettle:** A stainless steel or aluminum pot works well.
- **Heat-resistant Gloves:** For safety when handling hot items.

### Food-Grade Water Containers

Storing clean water is just as important as purifying it. Invest in food-grade containers to keep your purified water safe. These containers should be BPA-free and designed to store drinking water for extended periods.

#### Considerations for Water Containers:

- **Size and Capacity:** Choose containers that fit your needs and storage space.
- **Sealability:** Ensure they have airtight lids to prevent contamination.
- **Material:** Opt for durable materials that won‚Äôt leach chemicals into water.

### Water Testing Kits

To ensure that your water is safe to drink, have a water testing kit handy. These kits test for common contaminants like bacteria, nitrates, and heavy metals. Knowing the quality of your water can guide you in choosing the right purification method.

#### Using Water Testing Kits:

1. Collect a sample of water in a clean container.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the testing kit.
3. Wait for the results and analyze them based on the kit‚Äôs guide.

Preparedness is key during emergencies, especially regarding water purification. By gathering these essential tools and supplies, you‚Äôll be set to ensure access to safe drinking water, no matter the situation. Stay proactive and make sure you have these items ready in your emergency kit.

### Conclusion

Purifying water during an emergency is crucial for your health and well-being. By employing effective methods, such as boiling, chemical treatment, or filtration, you can significantly reduce the risk of waterborne illnesses. Each method has its pros and cons, and knowing which to use can make all the difference when clean water is scarce.

What I didn‚Äôt expect is how damn good ‚ÄòSexy‚Äô is.

A lot of the time I think Glee is great but doesn‚Äôt quite hit the perfect emotional notes, but this episode was full of storylines that really, really did, including:

* The scene between Blaine and Burt on Kurt‚Äôs reticence to face up to sexual stuff, which just felt perfectly-executed - authentic and true to both characters and fantastically well-written. Possibly the best-written single scene I‚Äôve watched in S2 so far.
* The scene between Santana and Brittany is also perfect - so heart-wrenching to watch Santana finally pluck up the courage to leave herself vulnerable and to face her sexuality, and for Brittany to show so much genuine seriousness and candour. In a show frequently driven by characters behaving in selfish, unsympathetic ways, this scene really shines as an example of two characters having sincere, sympathetic motives and neither really being 'wrong'.
* Holly realising her dissatisfaction with her bohemian, itinerant lifestyle and telling Will she wants to try something serious

Then it‚Äôs also very, very funny throughout, driven by some excellent acting:

* The Afternoon Delight fiasco (speaks for itself)
* Rachel‚Äôs glorious delivery of ‚Äòare you lost, Noah?‚Äô at the Celibacy Club meeting
* Emma‚Äôs increasingly-panicked, high-pitched delivery of ‚Äòthis stuff isn‚Äôt for kids and it isn‚Äôt for adults‚Äô
* Blaine‚Äôs incredulous faces as Sue puts together her deranged coffee surrogate
* Santana‚Äôs expression after Brittany says that she thinks a stork will bring her baby
* ‚ÄòWith Berry in those tights, we don‚Äôt stand a chance‚Äô - and another glorious example of Rachel‚Äôs attempt at bringing the ‚Äòsexy librarian schoolgirl chic‚Äô
* Quinn nudging Rachel away with such exquisitely delicate disdain as she tries to create some Celibacy Club solidarity

The performances are top notch:

* 'Do You Want To Touch Me‚Äô - exhilaratingly fun
* ‚ÄòLandslide‚Äô is just beautiful, really tugs at the heartstrings
* I feel like the voices come together beautifully for ‚ÄòAfternoon Delight‚Äô

Really think it‚Äôs a near-perfect episode. Only thing that didn‚Äôt quite hit was Emma‚Äôs acknowledgement that she was still in love with Will - while a necessary progression, it felt a bit rushed/abrupt after Emma‚Äôs gradual estrangement from Will so far that season. Beyond that minor quibble - 9.5/10 episode. Feels like a genuinely underrated one.",11,1734826112.0,glee,4,1.0,False

‚ÄúManagement says we‚Äôre behind on the quarterly projections,‚Äù he continued, dragging out the word ‚Äòmanagement‚Äô like it physically hurt him. ‚ÄúSo congratulations, we‚Äôve won a glamorous evening of spreadsheets, client calls, and whatever‚Äôs left of the coffee in the breakroom.‚Äù

‚ÄúFantastic,‚Äù Mia muttered from her desk, propping her chin on her hand. She twirled a pen absently, her brown hair pulled back in a messy ponytail. ‚ÄúJust what I wanted for Christmas.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt least we‚Äôll be celebrating together,‚Äù Ryan added, flashing one of his trademark grins. He had perched himself on the edge of my desk, fiddling with his perfectly knotted tie.

I glanced at the clock. 8:47 p.m. The big digital numbers were glowing red against the off-white walls. I sighed, letting my eyes wander towards the window. Just outside, the city was a beautiful blur of frost-covered buildings and blinking traffic lights. Snowflakes were gently tapping against the glass.

Sophia spoke up. ‚ÄúAre we seriously doing this?‚Äù She was leaning back in her chair with her arms crossed, her dark eyeliner smudged slightly from rubbing her eyes. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt they just push this deadline up *again* last week?‚Äù

‚ÄúCorporate wants what corporate wants,‚Äù Sean replied, throwing up his hands in surrender. ‚ÄúAnd we don‚Äôt really get a vote on it.‚Äù

‚ÄúSpeak for yourself,‚Äù Arjun piped up from a nearby cubicle. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got tickets to the Packers game tomorrow. No chance I‚Äôm staying late and missing it.‚Äù

‚ÄúDream big, Arjun,‚Äù Mia teased, her lips quirking up into a half-smile. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be lucky if we get out of here before midnight.‚Äù

Behind me, the printer sputtered to life with a mechanical *whirr-click*. It began spitting out pages slowly, as if it was resentful for the extra work. I grabbed the fresh stack of hot paper, thumbing through them before handing them off to Sofia.

I yawned and returned back to my desk.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre quiet tonight,‚Äù Ryan said, nudging me softly with his elbow. ‚ÄúYou good?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust tired,‚Äù I replied, my voice heavier than I intended. ‚ÄúFeels like we‚Äôve already been here forever.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause we have,‚Äù Mia said, standing up to stretch. Her chair slid away in protest. ‚ÄúSeriously, what time is it? Is it still Monday?""

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Tuesday,‚Äù Sean called out without looking up from his laptop. ‚ÄúWelcome to the future.‚Äù

By 9:30, the breakroom was running low on coffee, and the vending machine had officially eaten its third dollar bill of the night.

‚ÄúThis thing‚Äôs a scam,‚Äù muttered Daniel, kicking the vending machine with a dull *thunk*. He was the newest hire, still full of the kind of naive frustration the rest of us had long since buried. ‚ÄúSeriously, how is this even legal?‚Äù

‚ÄúConsider it your initiation,‚Äù Sofia said, smirking. ‚ÄúEveryone loses money to that thing at least once.‚Äù

‚ÄúTwice if you‚Äôre me,‚Äù I added, earning a laugh from Mia.

*SKRRRR-CHUNK*.

The sound of the printer jamming brought all of our conversations to a halt. We all turned to look at it, as if we were expecting it to apologize for the interruption.

Sean sighed dramatically and pushed back his chair. ‚ÄúOf course. Of course, it jams now. Why not?‚Äù He stomped over, yanking open the printer tray with a sharp *clack*. ‚ÄúJeez‚ÄîWho was printing *War and Peace*?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was me,‚Äù Arjun admitted sheepishly, raising a hand. ‚ÄúClient files. They wanted physical copies of everything. I didn‚Äôt realize it was... well, that much.‚Äù

‚ÄúDude, this isn‚Äôt 1998,‚Äù Sean shot back, tugging at a crumpled wad of paper jammed deep in the machine. ‚ÄúTell them to use a PDF.‚Äù

As Sean wrestled with the printer, Mia turned to me, leaning on the edge of my desk. ‚ÄúSo,‚Äù she said, smirking, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your bet? Is Sean going to fix it, or is he going to make it worse?‚Äù

‚ÄúI give it five minutes before he wakes up IT,‚Äù I said, matching her smirk.¬†

‚ÄúHey, I heard that,‚Äù Sean called over his shoulder. ‚ÄúAnd for the record, I‚Äôm very close to fixing it.‚Äù

Just as he said it, the printer groaned loudly and spat out a mangled page covered in black streaks. Sean posed, holding it up like a trophy. ‚ÄúSee? Progress.‚Äù

Mia shook her head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still going with ‚Äòmakes it worse.‚Äô‚Äù

The joking helped, even if only for a moment.

Just as Sean moved on to fiddling with the toner cartridge, the overhead lights flickered once, then twice. A faint *buzzing* filled the air, and everyone looked up instinctively.

‚ÄúOld building,‚Äù Sofia muttered, rolling her eyes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd think with the rent they charge for this place, they could afford to keep the lights on.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think it adds character,‚Äù Ryan quipped. He leaned back in his chair, balancing precariously on the two rear legs.¬†

‚ÄúAwesome,‚Äù Daniel said. ‚ÄúMy new workplace has character.‚Äù

Within a few moments, the lights eventually steadied.

‚ÄúI need some coffee,‚Äù Mia announced, ‚ÄúAnyone else?‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd grab me one of those protein bars from the cabinet if there‚Äôs any left. Please and thanks.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm on it.‚Äù Mia gave a small two finger salute before heading off towards the breakroom.

Sean finally stepped back from the printer, his hands covered in black toner smudges. ‚ÄúOkay, we‚Äôre back in business,‚Äù he declared, pressing the power button. The machine beeped once, then twice, before spewing out a single blank page.

‚ÄúOnce again, progress,‚Äù Sean said with a grin.

The breakroom door creaked open, and Mia poked her head out, holding up an empty coffee pot. ‚ÄúOkay, who‚Äôs the monster that left this empty and didn‚Äôt start a new one?‚Äù

Sofia raised her hand. ‚ÄúGuilty. Sorry. I didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd still be here this late.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, now I‚Äôm suffering for your crimes,‚Äù Mia said, disappearing back into the breakroom.

A few minutes later Mia returned, carrying a steaming mug. She tossed me a knock off multigrain bar.¬†

Right when I caught it, the office phone on Sean‚Äôs desk rang. We all paused, exchanging glances.

Sean frowned, picking it up. ‚ÄúHello? ...Nope, no one here by that name. Wrong number.‚Äù He hung up, shaking his head. ‚ÄúWho even calls an office landline this late?‚Äù

‚ÄúTelemarketers, probably,‚Äù Daniel offered.

‚ÄúOr ghosts,‚Äù Ryan said in a mock-spooky voice, wiggling his fingers.

But the phone rang again, this time at Sofia‚Äôs desk. She stared at it for a moment before picking up. ‚ÄúHello? ...What? Sorry, I think you have the wrong number.‚Äù She hung up quickly, her expression uneasy. ‚ÄúThat was weird. Same thing, someone asking for a name I didn‚Äôt recognize.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs the client,‚Äù Arjun suggested. ‚ÄúThey probably screwed up and sent the files to the wrong department.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not even one of our numbers,‚Äù Sofia said, holding up the receiver. The tiny display screen showed a string of unfamiliar digits.

Sean shrugged. ‚ÄúWhatever. Just ignore it. They‚Äôll figure it out eventually.‚Äù

But then another phone rang. And another. One after the other, in no discernible pattern. The shrill *RING-RING* bounced across the office like an offbeat symphony.

‚ÄúOkay, this is officially creepy,‚Äù Mia said, clutching her coffee mug with both of her hands.

I glanced around the room. The phones weren‚Äôt just ringing, they were flashing with strange symbols. Random sequences of dashes and dots, like some kind of binary code.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is that?‚Äù Sofia said, staring at her phone.

‚ÄúNo clue,‚Äù Sean muttered, leaning over to look at his. ‚ÄúMaybe IT‚Äôs running a test or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúWho tests phones at ten at night?‚Äù Ryan asked.

The phones stopped ringing all at once, leaving behind the deafening sound of silence. A few moments passed with all of us just staring at each other.

Then the printer beeped again. This time, it spit out a single page. Sean walked over and grabbed it, furrowing his brow.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù I asked.

He turned the page toward us. It was blank except for a single word printed in large, bold letters: *HELLO.*

‚ÄúOkay, who‚Äôs messing with us?‚Äù Sean began waving the paper around like it was evidence in a trial. ‚ÄúCome on. This has an office prank written all over it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait. Something‚Äôs... Wrong,‚Äù Arjun said, his voice unusually quiet. He was staring at his monitor, his fingers hovering above the keyboard.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, ‚Äòwrong‚Äô?‚Äù Ryan asked, leaning over his desk.

‚ÄúMy screen just froze,‚Äù Arjun replied, gesturing at his monitor. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not like a regular crash. Look.‚Äù

We all crowded around him, peering at his screen. There wasn't an error message, but his desktop monitor had turned completely black. Every few seconds a faint, flickering static line ran across the monitor like an old television set.

‚ÄúIs it the network?‚Äù Sofia asked, glancing at her own screen.

Before Arjun could answer, her computer screen blinked in response, then it followed suit. Her monitor displayed more faint, writhing static lines.

‚ÄúAlright, now I‚Äôm officially freaked out,‚Äù Sofia said, backing away from her desk.

One by one, the monitors across the office started being filtered by white-noise and static lines.

‚ÄúSeriously, what the hell is going on?‚Äù Daniel‚Äôs voice cracked.

‚ÄúPower surge, maybe?‚Äù Mia suggested, though she didn‚Äôt sound convinced.

‚ÄúPower‚Äôs still on,‚Äù Sean pointed out. ‚ÄúThe lights are fine. This feels more like... I don‚Äôt know. A hack?‚Äù

‚ÄúWho would hack *us*?‚Äù Ryan said, looking incredulous. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not exactly high rollers.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, I don‚Äôt care what anyone says,‚Äù Daniel muttered, grabbing his bag. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm out. This is too weird.‚Äù

‚ÄúSit down,‚Äù Sean snapped, his frustration flaring. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just bail. We still have to finish this project.‚Äù

‚ÄúFinish?‚Äù Daniel gestured around the room. ‚ÄúThe computers are fried. How exactly are we supposed to finish anything?‚Äù

Sean opened his mouth to argue, but the words caught in his throat. He looked toward the far side of the office, his expression shifting from irritation to confusion.

‚ÄúWait, where‚Äôs the exit?‚Äù Sean asked, his voice soft.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, ‚Äòwhere‚Äôs the exit‚Äô?‚Äù Mia said, turning to look.

The glass doors leading to the elevators and stairwell were gone. In their place was a smooth, featureless wall that blended seamlessly with the rest of the office.

‚ÄúNo way,‚Äù I whispered, standing up and walking toward where the doors should have been. My fingers brushed against the wall. ‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt be right.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet's check out the emergency exit,‚Äù Sean said, his tone soft, nearly silent.

We wandered toward the red-lit EXIT sign in the corner, but when we reached it, the door beneath it was gone too. Just another seamless wall.

‚ÄúWhat the actual hell is happening?‚Äù Mia asked.

Sean pounded on the wall where the door should have been. *Thud. Thud. Thud.* The sound was dull with no indication there was any empty space behind it.

‚ÄúThe windows,‚Äù Sofia murmured, her eyes scanning the office. ‚ÄúThere should be windows here. Where are the windows?‚Äù

She was right. The large windows that normally lined the east side of the office were gone, replaced by more of that smooth, featureless surface.

‚ÄúOkay, deep breaths,‚Äù Ryan said, holding up his hands. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not jump to conclusions. There‚Äôs got to be an explanation for this.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah? Like what?‚Äù Daniel shot back.

The room felt colder, the faint hum of the AC now joined by an occasional *crackle*, like static electricity building in the air.

I walked back to my desk, instinctively reaching for my phone. It was dead, the screen just as black as the monitors.

‚ÄúAnyone else‚Äôs phone working?‚Äù I asked.

A chorus of murmurs followed as everyone checked their devices. Nothing. No power, no signal, just dead.

‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt make sense,‚Äù Arjun muttered, ‚ÄúBuildings don‚Äôt just... change.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe need to stay calm,‚Äù Ryan said, though his voice wavered slightly. ‚ÄúLike I said, there‚Äôs got to be a logical explanation. Maybe it‚Äôs‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what?‚Äù Mia asked, incredulous. ‚ÄúRyan, we‚Äôve worked here for three years. The walls don‚Äôt just‚Äî‚Äù

*BZZZZZZZRRRT.*

The sound ripped through the air like a live wire, making us all jump. It came from the printer again. Slowly, we all turned to look.

The top tray sputtered out a fresh page, crisp and white. Sean hesitated, then stepped forward to grab it. His face went pale as he read the single word printed on it:

*STAY.*

For a long moment, no one moved. Then the lights flickered again, plunging the room into brief darkness before snapping back on.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Sean said. ‚ÄúSomethings wrong.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs this some kind of joke?‚Äù Sofia broke the silence, her voice tight. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs doing this?‚Äù

‚ÄúNobody‚Äôs doing it,‚Äù Mia said, pacing. ‚ÄúYou saw what happened to the doors, to the windows. That isn‚Äôt... it‚Äôs not possible.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah? Well, it feels pretty damn real to me,‚Äù Daniel snapped, slinging his bag over his shoulder. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not waiting around to find out what happens next.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere are you going?‚Äù Ryan asked, stepping in front of him.

Daniel hesitated, the weight of Ryan's words settling in. He glanced around the office, the oppressive silence broken only by the occasional *tick-tick-tick* of an analogue clock pressed somewhere against the far wall.

‚ÄúThen what do we do?‚Äù he asked, his voice softer.

‚ÄúWe stay calm,‚Äù Ryan said, though his eyes betrayed him. ‚ÄúWe figure this out together.‚Äù

A sudden metallic *clang* echoed from somewhere deep within the office.

‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù Sofia whispered.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, my throat dry. ‚ÄúIt sounded like it came from the conference room.‚Äù

Sean grabbed a heavy stapler off a desk. ‚ÄúAlright, stay here. I‚Äôll check it out.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going alone,‚Äù Mia said firmly, picking up a large paperweight.

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù Sean said, glancing around. ‚ÄúAnyone else?‚Äù

Ryan and I exchanged a look before stepping forward. ‚ÄúStrength in numbers, right?‚Äù Ryan said, forcing a weak smile.

The four of us moved cautiously toward the conference room, our footsteps muffled by the cheap carpet. Sean reached the door first and pushed it open with the stapler. The door swung inward with a low *creak*.

‚ÄúAnything?‚Äù Mia whispered.

Sean stepped inside, squinting in the dim light. He tried to flip the light switch but nothing happened. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù

The overhead projector flickered to life with a *pop*, casting a faint blue glow across the room. Static filled the screen, accompanied by the familiar high-pitched *whine* of an old tape spinning.

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù Sean muttered, looking towards the projection.

The static on the screen resolved into a grainy image of a man sitting at a desk. He was dressed in 1970s office attire, his wide tie crooked, his hair disheveled. His hands were trembling as he typed on a clunky typewriter. His face was pale and drawn, dark circles hollowing his eyes. On the desk beside him, a bottle of pills lay spilled, its contents scattered.

We watched in horrified silence as the man reached for the bottle, his movements sluggish. He hesitated, his fingers trembling, before tipping the pills into his hand. The image froze as he raised them to his mouth.

‚ÄúWas that...‚Äù Ryan began, but his voice trailed off.

The screen flickered again, and a new image appeared: a woman wearing an 80s suit, it rested stark against her petite frame. She was sitting in the breakroom, her head in her hands. A cup of coffee sat untouched in front of her, the steam curling upward. As the camera zoomed in, we saw her tears streaking her heavily rouged cheeks. She stood suddenly, opened the cabinet, and retrieved a bottle of cleaning chemicals. The screen froze as she unscrewed the cap.

‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù Mia whispered, covering her mouth.

The projector clicked again, this time showing a man the office knew. John Stevens. His desk was cluttered with energy drink cans and takeout containers. He stared blankly at a glowing monitor, the bags under his eyes almost purple. He raised a box cutter, his hands shaking, and pressed it to his wrist. The screen froze just as the blade bit into his skin.

‚ÄúThese... these are people who worked here,‚Äù Sofia mumbled. ‚ÄúI knew John. Our office was closed for a while week after he‚Ä¶‚Äù

The projector whined, the images blurring together before the final one appeared. It was the office as we knew it, but something moved at the far end of the room.

It took everything we had to see through the grainy footage. But the thing was tall, skeletal. Its translucent, grayish skin stretched tightly over a warped, angular frame.¬†

The static shifted and we could see its torso. There was what looked like an exposed ribcage, wrapped in glowing wires that sparked and hissed.¬†

Eventually the figure began to studder forward, and as it got closer to the camera we could make out its face. Or lack thereof.

It's head resembled a warped, featureless monitor, with a jagged vertical crack down the center that pulsed with a sporadic green light.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is that?‚Äù Ryan whispered.

The creature tilted its head toward the camera as if it had heard him. The crack in its head widened to reveal jagged, oily protrusions that looked like broken typewriter keys.¬†

‚ÄúTurn the projector off!‚Äù Sofia shouted.

Sean ran over to the device, slamming his hand against the buttons, but the footage kept rolling.¬†

The screen erupted into a kaleidoscope of broken images: dead-eyed employees, tired hands fumbling with nooses, guns being loaded, razors being raised. And just as the dozens of workers were about to complete their show for us, everything stopped.¬†

The projector shut off with a loud *pop*, plunging the room into complete darkness.

‚ÄúStep outside‚Äù Sean muttered. We listened and left the conference room.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù Daniel asked.

Mia opened her mouth but before she could say anything, the sound of distant typewriter keys filled the room: *click-clack, click-clack*. It was joined by the rhythmic beeping of a fax machine.¬†

We turned as one, our eyes drawn to the far end of the office.¬†

What we saw is hard to explain. The air had hummed and whirred. The empty space was contorting around itself and sucking in the nearby oxygen, creating a visible distortion in the room.

Then, within that whirling mass, a form began to flicker. Its presence warped the air around it, spreading an awful scent of burning plastic.

Then it stepped out. It was the same thing from the projector screen.

Four long arms ending in needle-like fingers clicked together, gripping the nearby carpet around it as it pulled itself forward. Black ink dripped from its clawed hand with every lurch.

‚ÄúWhat do we do?‚Äù Sofia murmured.

The creature tilted its head toward us, the green light in its facial crevice flickering brighter as it fully manifested.¬†

Then it opened its jagged mouth and spoke a single word in a distorted, metallic voice:

*‚ÄúWork.‚Äù*

The creature then lurched forward with a horrific screech, its limbs jerking like a camera flash. The ink trailing behind it hissed and bubbled, spreading across the carpet.

Sofia screamed and bolted, running toward the breakroom.

‚ÄúWait!‚Äù Sean shouted, but it was too late. The creature twisted unnaturally, its segmented arm snapping forward like a whip. The claws at the end of its hand clamped around Sofia‚Äôs shoulder with a sickening *crunch*. Her scream turned into a strangled gurgle as the creature yanked her off her feet and dragged her toward the nearest desk.

‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù Ryan gasped, stumbling backward.¬†

The creature slammed Sofia onto the desk with a bone-rattling *thud*, scattering pens and papers everywhere. One clawed hand held her down while the other reached for the computer tower beside her.¬†

The green light in its head flared brighter as it jammed its claws into the machine, ripping out cables and circuit boards with unfettered precision.

‚ÄúPlease!‚Äù Sofia sobbed, thrashing against its grip. ‚ÄúHelp me!‚Äù

The creature ignored her. With a grinding mechanical *whirr*, it plunged the jagged wires into Sofia‚Äôs chest. Blood sprayed across the desk as she screamed, her back arching in agony. The wires pulsed and twisted, snaking their way under her skin. Her fingers clawed at the air, twitching as her body convulsed violently.

‚ÄúDo something!‚Äù Mia cried, tears streaming down her face.

‚ÄúI‚Äî‚Äù Sean stammered, still clutching the stapler in his trembling hands. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù

Sofia‚Äôs screams stopped abruptly. Her body went limp, her eyes wide and glassy. For a moment, I thought she was dead. But then the thing let her go.

After a few seconds her body began sputtering. Her movements were stiff and jerky, her head lulled unnaturally to the side and looked at us. Her mouth opened, and a garbled, static laden voice emerged: ‚ÄúStay with us.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Mia whispered, backing away. ‚ÄúOh my God, no.‚Äù

The creature turned toward the group, the green light in its head flickering rapidly. Sofia‚Äîif it was still Sofia‚Äîstood up beside it, her movements eerily synchronized with the creature‚Äôs. The cables and wires from the computer tower were sparking faintly from her chest as she stepped forward.

‚ÄúRun!‚Äù Sean shouted, grabbing Mia‚Äôs arm and pulling her toward the nearest cubicle.

The office descended into chaos. People scattered in every direction. Arjun was the only one left frozen in place.

The creature saw him and let out another piercing screech, its claws whipping through the air as it lurched forward. Arjun tried to duck, but the creature‚Äôs claw caught his leg, sending him sprawling onto the floor. ‚ÄúHelp!‚Äù he cried, clawing at the carpet as the creature dragged him backward.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Ryan shouted, grabbing a chair and hurling it at the creature. It hit the thing‚Äôs angular head with a loud *clang*, but the creature didn‚Äôt even seem to notice. Its claws dug into Arjun‚Äôs torso, lifting him off the ground as if he weighed nothing. It slammed him onto a desk and began tearing apart another computer.

We didn‚Äôt wait to see what happened next. Sean, Mia, Ryan, and I ducked behind a row of cubicles. ‚ÄúWhat do we do?‚Äù Mia whispered, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt just leave them!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt fight that thing!‚Äù Sean hissed.¬†

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt just‚Äî‚Äù Mia‚Äôs voice broke as Arjun‚Äôs screams echoed through the office, followed by a grotesque *squelch* as his flesh began to be rearranged.

I peeked over the edge of the cubicle. I saw the creature's claws move with mechanical focus as it fused Arjun‚Äôs body to the shattered remains of a monitor. Blood dripped onto the desk, pooling around the tangled mess of cables and broken glass. Arjun‚Äôs head twitched violently, his eyes rolling back into his skull. When his mouth opened, a distorted voice spilled out: ‚ÄúStay.‚Äù

I ducked back down, my stomach churning. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Äî‚Äù

A loud *bang* cut me off. We all turned toward the sound. Daniel had grabbed a fire extinguisher and was swinging it wildly. ‚ÄúCome on, you son of a bitch!‚Äù he screamed, his voice cracking with desperation.

The creature snapped its head towards the young man, its crack flaring open exposing its gnarled teeth-like protrusions. It moved fast, its clawed hand slicing through the air with a sharp *whoosh*. Daniel‚Äôs voice was cut short as the claws tore through his side.

‚ÄúMove‚Äù Sean pleaded, shoving us toward the far side of the office. ‚ÄúWe need to keep moving.‚Äù

We scrambled over overturned chairs and scattered papers, the sounds of the creature‚Äôs claws tearing through flesh echoed behind us.

As we rounded a corner, I took one final glance back. The creature stood in the center of the office, its ink-stained claws dripping as it loomed over Daniel‚Äôs lifeless body. The twisted forms of Sofia and Arjun flanked it, their movements stiff and unnatural, their mouths repeating the same garbled phrase: ‚ÄúStay. Stay. Stay.‚Äù

I refocused on my friends, our hearts pounding as we pressed forward.¬†

‚ÄúThis way,‚Äù Sean barked, leading us toward the far side of the conference rooms.¬†

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt keep running‚Äù Mia cried, clutching her side.

Sean skidded to a stop. He looked almost feral, but when he saw Mia his face softened. ‚ÄúYou're right. You guys keep moving down the hallway.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù Ryan snapped.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôll fight it,‚Äù Sean said, his voice low,¬† ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôll lead it away. You three‚Äîfind another way out. There‚Äôs gotta be something.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Mia shouted, grabbing his arm. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not splitting up! That‚Äôs insane!‚Äù

Sean pried her hand off. ‚ÄúListen to me. We don‚Äôt all get out of this unless someone slows it down. I can do that. I'll put my old track star talent to some good use.‚Äù

‚ÄúSean, don‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù I started, but the words died in my throat as a piercing *screech* cut through the air. The creature rounded the far corner, its warped form illuminated by the green flicker of its head.

‚ÄúGo!‚Äù Sean shouted, shoving Ryan toward the next hallway. ‚ÄúNow!‚Äù

‚ÄúSean!‚Äù Mia screamed, tears streaming down her face as Ryan dragged her away.

I hesitated, torn between running and staying, but Sean gave me one last look‚Äîa mix of fear and determination. ‚ÄúGo!‚Äù he yelled again, louder this time.

I turned and bolted after Ryan and Mia, my chest tight with guilt. Behind us, Sean picked up a chair and hurled it at the creature with a feral yell. The chair shattered against its angular head with a *clang*, and for a moment, I dared to hope it worked. I heard him sprint away.

But then came his scream‚Äîa raw, guttural sound.

We somehow stumbled into the breakroom, slamming the door shut behind us. Ryan jammed a chair under the handle. Mia collapsed onto the floor, sobbing into her hands.

‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù Ryan asked, ‚ÄúWhat the hell do we do now?‚Äù

I looked over the room. There, at the far wall, was something we hadn‚Äôt seen yet: a window.

‚ÄúIs that real?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI think so,‚Äù Ryan said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a way out.‚Äù

The glass was large and covered in frost, the city lights beyond filtered into the room. For a moment, hope flickered in my chest.

‚ÄúWhat if it‚Äôs another trick?‚Äù Mia asked, her voice tinged with panic. ‚ÄúWhat if we jump and it just‚Äî‚Äù

The creature‚Äôs mechanical screech echoed through the hallway we had just left, I could already hear the metallic grind of its movements lurching closer.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have time to argue,‚Äù Ryan said. He grabbed a chair and hurled it at the window. The glass shattered with a deafening crash. Shards of the window pane scattered across the floor and glittered like ice in the dim light.¬†

A rush of cold air overtook the room, sharp and biting, but it felt real. It felt freeing.

‚ÄúGo on.‚Äù Ryan shouted, pushing Mia forward.¬†

Mia hesitated for only a second before climbing onto the windowsill. The wind whipped through her hair as she looked back at us, tears streaming down her face. ‚ÄúAre you sure this is‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúJust go!‚Äù Ryan yelled. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be right behind you.‚Äù

One by one, we climbed onto the sill. The city stretched out below us, impossibly far away. We looked for any type of fire ladder, but the building was flat. The fall down would be fatal for us.¬†

We heard the door in the office shatter. It was quickly approaching the broken window.

‚ÄúTogether,‚Äù Ryan said, his voice steady despite the fear in his eyes. ‚ÄúWe jump together.‚Äù

Without another word, we leapt.¬†

The cold air rushed past us as we plummeted, the wind tearing at our clothes and filling our ears with a deafening roar. The ground rose up to meet us, faster and faster, and just as we were about to hit‚Äî

I woke up.

I was back at my desk. Everything was pristine, untouched. The lights were steady, the air quiet.

I blinked, disoriented. Papers sat neatly stacked beside my keyboard, untouched. My computer screen was on, displaying a spreadsheet I didn‚Äôt remember opening. The digital clock had 8:47 p.m. displayed.¬†

I heard a gasp. ‚ÄúMia?‚Äù I whispered, turning to her.

She was at her desk, her tear-streaked face lit by the glow of her monitor. ‚ÄúI... I don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù she said, her voice hollow. ‚ÄúWas it a dream?‚Äù

Ryan sat a few desks over, staring blankly at his screen. ‚ÄúIt felt real,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúIt was real. I know it was.‚Äù

We exchanged uneasy glances, each of us struggling to process what had happened‚Äîor hadn‚Äôt happened. But the longer we sat there, the more the mundanity of the office crept back in. The steady hum of the HVAC system. The faint *tap-tap* of a keyboard. The familiar glow of fluorescent lights.

I wanted to say something, but my body moved on autopilot. My hands hovered over the keyboard, my mind blank.

The silence was broken by Mia‚Äôs chair creaking as she shifted. ‚ÄúWe should... we should get back to work,‚Äù she said softly, almost to herself.

I opened my mouth to argue but found no words. Mia sniffled, wiping her eyes. Her fingers trembled as she began typing. Ryan followed, his keyboard clacking steadily.

I stared at my screen, my reflection distorted in the monitor‚Äôs glass. The green glow of a spreadsheet flickered slightly, almost imperceptibly.

In the corner of my eye, something moved‚Äîa faint shadow, like the flicker of static. I turned, but nothing was there.

I placed my hands on the keyboard and began to type.",4,1734826104.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I wanted to share my experience with vacuum sealers since I've been using them for years and recently went through the process of finding the best one. I know how overwhelming it can be with all the options out there, so I hope this helps someone make a better decision.

After trying several FoodSaver models and doing tons of research, I've found that the FoodSaver V4400 is hands down the best option right now. You can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/vacuumsealer

What really impressed me about this model is how it handles both wet and dry foods. I do a lot of meal prep and sous vide cooking, and this machine hasn't let me down once. The automatic moisture detection is a game-changer ‚Äì no more guessing whether you're using the right setting.

I used to have the basic FoodSaver models, but they would struggle with multiple seals in a row. This V4400 has better cooling, so you can seal batch after batch without waiting. Trust me, when you're packaging a whole Costco haul, this matters!

Some key features that make it stand out:
- Automatic bag detection (just insert and it starts)
- Built-in roll storage and cutter
- Retractable handheld sealer for containers
- 5-year warranty (most others only offer 1 year)

The seal width is also wider than cheaper models, which means better protection against freezer burn. I've had meats stored for 6+ months come out tasting fresh.

If you're wondering about bag costs, I've found that using third-party bags works just fine. They're much cheaper than FoodSaver branded ones and do the job perfectly.

For anyone on the fence about vacuum sealers in general, they're absolutely worth it. I've saved hundreds on groceries by buying in bulk and preserving everything properly. Plus, my leftovers actually get eaten now instead of turning into science experiments in the back of the fridge!

You can grab the V4400 here: https://athometouch.com/vacuumsealer. The price fluctuates a bit on Amazon, but it's usually the best deal around. I've seen it go on sale during Prime Day and Black Friday too.

One last tip: get some mason jar attachments if you can. They're great for storing dry goods like coffee beans and cereals. The vacuum sealing keeps everything super fresh, and you can reuse the jars endlessly.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions about vacuum sealers or food storage in general. I'm always happy to share what I've learned!",1,1734825957.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

1hjmpii,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1hjmpii/cold_approach_a_good_method_in_my_opinion/,Cold approach - A good method in my opinion,"I often see posts about men not knowing exactly how to approach women in an everyday setting without being seen as creepy. Thought I'd might share this :) 

I'll speak from my personal experience as a woman. There will surely be diverging opinions, depending on your experiences. And that's fine. I'm curious what other women think about this? And men? 

So there's a certain kind of men that I think move differently in this world - and they always get a positive reaction from me. It's the ones that¬†**approach in a direct way, and yet leave plenty of space for me to move freely without expectations and without making me bear any consequence should I choose not to reciprocate**. Now let me explain because I know it's not very tangible at this point.

1. Approach in a direct way

I love a man that is clear about his direction and that can verbalise it! Without tip toeing around it. It shows confidence and clarity. It's mature and there's no time wasted. When someone is comfortable with showing an interest - in a respectful way - that's attractive! 

2. Leaving plenty of space for me to move freely without expectations

I love when a man approaches and then pulls back a little bit, leaving me space to make a choice without any kind of pressure. I love when these interactions are ""free"" - that I don't feel like I have to pay anything back in return. It's kind of like receiving a gift and knowing there's nothing to reciprocate. So I can have the space to receive it and enjoy it freely.

3. And without making me bear any consequence should I choose not to reciprocate.

This touches a bit on safety. As a woman, there's nothing I love more than to feel absolutely safe in the presence of a man. If I choose not to reciprocate the interaction, I don't want to have to carry anything. Any kind of resentment, frustration, anything!! I don't want to bear the consequence of me saying no (of course let's assume I say no in a respectful way). At this point, I don't owe you anything, I only owe myself truth towards what I'm feeling.

In real life, it could look like ""I love your style! I'd like to get to know you. I will give you my number, feel free to reach out"" and then leave with a smile OR ""I love your smile. I'd like to get to know you over coffee. May I get your number?"" (if it's a no, proceed to leave, wishing them a good day). 

Yeah the best way I could describe that kind of approach is ""gifting with an open hand"".

I (16m) had my first gf for 7 months starting feb this year. It was great for the most part, but after the fact I realise how badly I was getting treated but I still can‚Äôt get myself to move on.

For context, my gf (‚ÄòL‚Äô for privacy) was my only friend basically for the whole time we were dating. She was everything to me and so I put everything into my relationship with her. I realise now she didn‚Äôt do the same at any point and it‚Äôs only becoming more clear by the day.

There‚Äôs so many things I could go into, but I‚Äôd feel like I‚Äôm just crying for attention or just being whiny so I‚Äôll only go over the main details.

When we dated, I did everything to try make her happy; I bought her nice things from the shops, I took her to dinner, I walked her home from school every day and bring her a coffee when picking her up, just so she would be happy. The thing I realise is she was never grateful for anything I did. She hardly said thank you, and when she did she could never say it properly.

I introduced her to my family after a couple months of dating, and they got on great. I met her mum and we got on nicely, but when it came to meeting her dad, she flat out refused. I never pushed her on the matter because it wasn‚Äôt my business and I wouldn‚Äôt want to force her into anything that would make her uncomfortable. The thing that is strange to me tho is how after we broke up, I was messaging her cousin because we were still good friends at the time, and I found out she had introduced all her previous relationships to all her family without issues; which just felt odd to me.

Another thing is she would refuse to show me affection in public. Anytime in school or the shops, she would refuse to hold my hand, hug me, or even be near me at times. I‚Äôd respect that if it was personal, but her new bf (which she got the day after our break up) is literally making out with her at school and she‚Äôs constantly showing him affection like holding his arm or hugging him. It‚Äôs all just so strange. This new bf is also the guy she was accused of kissing by our classmates while we were dating, who she promised was a lie.

The final straw for me was something I only found out recently. I was talking to her friends (they‚Äôre not very close now because they don‚Äôt agree with how she treated me) and I found out she was lying to me for months on end. I hate the idea of smoking / vaping. It just disgusts me. When we got together, she promised me she would quit because she cared about me and would do it for me. I recently learned that this was a complete lie and she was just hiding it from me for 4+ months. The funny thing is, there was a few week period where she was in a constant bad mood no matter how I tried to help or comfort her. She eventually told me it was probably because of her withdrawals from not vaping, so she begged me to let her vape again. I reluctantly agreed because I‚Äôm not gonna force her into not vaping it‚Äôs just something I‚Äôm against.

My theory is she was just completely embarrassed of me because, for even more context, I‚Äôm a bit of a nerd in school and the top of my year (I‚Äôm not very popular). She was and still is one of the most popular people in our year, and is friends with almost everyone. 

The problem is, I still miss her. I miss how she made me laugh and how she would always stick up for me. I‚Äôm trying to move on, slowly but surely.

If anyone bothered to read all this, truly thank you. I just needed somewhere to rant all my problems because I don‚Äôt really have anyone in my life I can talk to about this stuff.",1,1734825500.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.67,False

------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has gained popularity in Charlotte, North Carolina, and for very good reasons. Many people desire a radiant smile, and teeth whitening can be an effective solution. If you're considering this treatment, you might be interested in exploring the benefits it offers.

Firstly, one of the most noticeable advantages of teeth whitening is the boost in self-confidence that comes with a brighter smile. When your teeth are whiter, you may feel more inclined to smile freely, engage with others, and express yourself without hesitation. This change can positively impact your personal and professional relationships in Charlotte. By investing in teeth whitening, you allow yourself to shine, opening doors to new opportunities.

Another benefit is the impact on your overall appearance. A bright smile can make you look younger and healthier. As we age, our teeth naturally lose their brightness, often appearing dull or yellow. Teeth whitening can counteract this effect, giving your face a more youthful glow. In Charlotte, where the local culture emphasizes beauty and wellness, having a bright, white smile can help you fit in and stand out positively.

Cost is frequently a consideration, and thankfully, teeth whitening in Charlotte can be affordable. Many dental clinics provide various options, ranging from in-office treatments to at-home kits. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of common teeth whitening methods available:

- **In-Office Whitening:** This method typically involves a session with a dentist, who uses powerful whitening agents to achieve immediate results.
- **At-Home Kits:** These are dentist-recommended kits that allow you to whiten your teeth in the comfort of your own home. Results take longer but can be very effective.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** Though not as dramatic, this is a simple way to maintain your white smile on a daily basis.

Furthermore, teeth whitening can be tailored to suit your unique needs. Every individual‚Äôs teeth respond differently to treatments. In Charlotte, qualified dental professionals will assess your teeth and recommend a personalized whitening plan. This ensures you get the best possible outcome based on the current state of your teeth.

For many people, the convenience of teeth whitening cannot be overlooked. Finding time in a busy schedule to visit a local dentist is often easier than you might think. Many Charlotte dentists offer flexible appointments to accommodate different schedules. Whether you choose an in-office treatment for quicker results or an at-home kit for a gradual approach, you can easily integrate teeth whitening into your routine.

Additionally, teeth whitening can serve as a preventive measure. Regular whitening treatments can help reduce the accumulation of stains and discoloration. In essence, it acts like a shield against future staining. If you often consume coffee, tea, or red wine, you may benefit from whitening treatments to keep your smile bright and vibrant.

Moreover, many people notice an improvement in oral hygiene habits after whitening treatments. When you invest time and money into creating a beautiful smile, you‚Äôre likely to pay closer attention to your daily dental care routine. This means brushing more effectively, flossing regularly, and seeing your dentist for routine cleanings, thus promoting better overall dental health.

The climate and lifestyle in Charlotte can also contribute to discoloration. Factors like humidity and diet can lead to staining over time. Teeth whitening offers a simple solution to combat these environmental impacts, ensuring that your smile remains as beautiful as the Queen City itself.

Choosing the Right Teeth Whitening Method for Your Needs
--------------------------------------------------------

If you're considering teeth whitening in Charlotte, North Carolina, you're not alone. Many people desire a brighter smile for various reasons, from special occasions to boosting self-confidence. Choosing the right teeth whitening method can make all the difference in achieving that radiant look. With various options available, understanding which one aligns best with your needs is essential.

First, it's important to recognize the types of teeth whitening methods available. Each comes with its pros and cons, depending on your lifestyle and budget. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the most popular options to help you decide:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **In-Office Whitening:**This is one of the fastest and most effective methods. Dental professionals use stronger bleaching agents that can produce noticeable results in just one session. If you want immediate results for an upcoming event, in-office whitening may be the best choice.
- **At-Home Kits:**Many dental offices in Charlotte offer professional at-home whitening kits. These kits typically include custom trays and a whitening gel. While they may take longer than in-office treatments, they are convenient for those who prefer to whiten their teeth at their own pace.
- **Over-the-Counter Products:**From strips to gels, various over-the-counter whitening products are available at drugstores. They are often more affordable but may deliver less dramatic results than professional treatments. If you're looking for a simple way to maintain your smile, OTC products can be a good option.
- **Natural Remedies:**Certain natural methods, such as baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, or activated charcoal, are popular among those seeking an alternative. While some may offer mild whitening effects, they often lack the potency and reliability of more established treatments. Always consult your dentist before trying these options.

Next, consider your dental health. It's crucial to consult with a dental professional before beginning any whitening treatment. They can assess your teeth and gums, ensuring you choose a method that is safe and effective. If you have sensitive teeth, your dentist may recommend specific products designed for sensitivity, or they might suggest a gentler approach to whitening.

Another factor to consider is how long you want the results to last. In-office whitening often provides longer-lasting results compared to at-home kits or over-the-counter products. However, maintenance is still necessary. Avoiding stain-inducing foods and drinks such as coffee, tea, and red wine can help prolong your results.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Cost is also an important consideration. In-office treatments are typically more expensive, with prices varying widely based on the dental practice and the specific procedure. At-home kits and over-the-counter products are generally more budget-friendly and may be better suited for those looking to save money.

Your lifestyle plays a crucial role in choosing a whitening method. If you're frequently on the go, at-home kits may offer the convenience you need. On the other hand, if you have a big event coming up and want quick results, in-office treatment could be the best route. It‚Äôs all about what works best for you.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Don‚Äôt forget to ask about maintenance. Once you've achieved your desired brightness, your dentist can provide you with tips on how to keep your smile looking fresh. Regular dental check-ups, good oral hygiene, and perhaps touch-up treatments will help in preserving your white smile over time.

Choosing the right teeth whitening method in Charlotte, North Carolina, entails assessing your goals, budget, and dental health. Whether you opt for in-office whitening or at-home solutions, the key is to find what fits best for your lifestyle while ensuring a safe and effective process. With the right choice, you can flaunt a dazzling smile, enhancing both your confidence and your overall appearance.

### Conclusion

Teeth whitening in Charlotte, North Carolina, can significantly enhance your smile and boost your confidence. With a variety of methods available, from professional treatments at dental offices to at-home kits and natural remedies, it‚Äôs essential to consider what suits your lifestyle and needs best.

Choosing the right whitening method depends on several factors, including your dental history, sensitivity concerns, and budget.

Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

I moved away because my relationship with my parents has always been strained and I've dealt with depression and anxiety since I was a young child and I needed a change. Since I moved my parents have shown no interest in my new life or visiting me even though I wasnt that far away and despite that it hurt I was fine with that. 
Anyway, around Thanksgiving this year, I found out they had gone to Texas to visit another brother (30M) and his family. I decided because they were gone it was the perfect time to go down and get my stuff. Me and SIL got in the truck that my parents had given to us as a gift and drove down. When we got there, we realized they had hired a dog sitter (DS) from their church, and because we didn't want to scare her with our unexpected presence, I called my mom and told her we were stopping by. Even though our relationship is strained, I didn't want to hurt her feelings by saying the only reason we were there was because we knew they weren't going to be there, so I made up a story for why we were in town. I even messaged the DS to tell her she didn't need to come by because we had everything taken care of.
The DS showed up around 10:30 pm, after we had been moving boxes and having a few drinks we had brought with us to make the whole experience of going through my childhood belongings a little more fun.
That night and the next morning seemed totally fine. We had coffee with the DS, chatting about dealing with difficult family relationships. At this point me and SIL were going through the garage, the seventh circle of hoarder hell. Rat feces all over my dead grandmother's heirlooms, jewelry boxes chewed through, boxes of family photos used as nesting material. It was so bad I had to go inside and puke.
After we had started loading the truck, DS left. About 30 minutes later, the cops showed up. Apparently the DS had called my parents and said we were ""ransacking the house room by room"" and ""stealing"" from them, which was absolutely not true. This caused my parents who were in Texas to call the local police to report a burglary and criminal trespassing and that we had ""stolen"" the truck, all because I had lied about why we were in town, so they said we had entered under a false pretense. They did not ever call me or SIL to clarify what was going on at any point but they did call my brother 3 hours away to yell at him multiple times. 
The whole time the cops were there, my parents were on the phone ramping them up about the car and that there was a ""burglary in progress"", so the officers were incredibly rude to us even though I had explained the situation multiple times. Eventually the cops left after about 40 minutes, saying that it was a civil matter and not really worth their time. We sat in the truck for hours in the cold waiting for my brother to come get us, intending to leave it there because even though we know we hadn't ""stolen"" it, it didn't feel right to drive it back up and be accused of something we didn't do. Because the truck was the only functional car we had on the farm at the time, my brother had to ask a friend for a ride in his truck to get to us. 
While we were sitting there, after about 2 and a half hours, DS and her retired cop dad came to the house, while on the phone with my parents, climbing into the back of the truck and going through the boxes on FaceTime while we were sitting in the cab. When we confronted them, the dad immediately threatened to call the cops on us for trespassing even though we're sitting in a car on a public street waiting for our ride. He continued to berate us so we drove to a well-lit grocery store parking lot right next to the sheriff station less than two minutes away. Finally my brother got to us and we loaded everything up and left our parents truck at the house.

My drink looked nothing at all like the photo. Being very new to mixing I thought perhaps half and half would float on top of boozy things, but it sank right to the bottom. My intuition should have told me that coffee beans won't float on half and half anyway.

My guess is that the cream has been slightly whipped for the drink in the photo, though the instructions say nothing about whipping. I haven't read the book cover to cover but the section about dairy also says nothing about whipping half and half.

1hjlz30,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltyobituaries/comments/1hjlz30/italian_man_dies_from_stubbornness_chocolate/,"Italian man dies from stubbornness, chocolate withdrawal ","Carmen Mallon‚Äôs spirit was released from his worn out shell of a body, likely while uttering an unnecessary curse word, and is now exploring the ‚Äúgreat junkyard‚Äù in the sky. He was surrounded by some of his loving family, some begrudgingly, all willing.

He was the second child of Anthony and Frances Mallon, raised Catholic in Niles, Ohio. God immediately recognized his mistake and broke the mold when he made Carmen. 

He adored the ladies - especially the good looking ones - and even tried his hand at marriage once. He loved cars and driving fast. He once said no matter how late he was for work he could get there on time in his 1976 Camaro. 

Carmen celebrated a lifetime of spitting in the face of authority. He hated anyone trying to help him or tell him what to do and he‚Äôd tell them exactly where to go when they tried.

He leaves behind three children, two grandchildren, one great grandchild and three sisters. He had a 30-year career working in the steel industry and later Sam‚Äôs Club until the ‚Äúdamn doctor told me I couldn‚Äôt work anymore‚Äù and had to turn in ‚Äúmy damn driver‚Äôs license‚Äù.

He was obsessed with candy, chips and cookies. Werthers, Lays and Oreo executives are devastated by his loss and may never recover financially. Unfortunately, chocolate bothered him later in life and he spent years in chocolate withdrawal, craving it intensely, which likely contributed to his irritability. 

He didn‚Äôt like sports and hated turkey. He loved his leather chair and Judges Judy and Mathis kept him company most days. He told stories of drinking Seagram‚Äôs 7 mixed with 7up but hadn‚Äôt had a drink in 40 years. He was the king of 3am butt dials. His favorite Christmas song was by Alvin and the Chipmunks and he listened to it at full volume in July.

Carmen cursed like a sailor and liked four-letter words as much as he liked his coffee. Two creams; two sugars. But he never sugar-coated anything. He was tough as nails yet melted like butter at the sight of his youngest daughter.

He was fiercely independent. If you ever told him he couldn‚Äôt do it; he would prove you wrong. Or get his wheelchair stuck trying. He once almost burned down his apartment with a grilled cheese sandwich.

He loved having ‚Äúcompany‚Äù and up until his death still demanded he have a couch for his guests to sit on in his nursing home room. 

He once threatened to bomb his nursing home. This is not an exaggeration nor was it the last nursing home he would conspire against. He probably didn‚Äôt mean it ‚Ä¶ but probably did. In any event, Carmen‚Äôs family deeply apologizes to each and every caretaker who crossed his path. 

He was never one for sentiment or religiosity (even though family snuck in a priest who anointed him and gave Last Rites, maybe against his wishes, but then again, maybe not). 

He died just two days after his ex-wife who he sometimes railed against and wished ill, but maybe secretly still cared about. It‚Äôs possible that knowing he outlived ‚Äúthat witch‚Äù was enough for him. And maybe it was time.

He was incredibly complicated and incredibly loved and will be greatly missed.

There will be no funeral and he didn‚Äôt really like flowers, so friends and family who wish to pay their respects should perform an unsolicited act of kindness for some poor, grumpy old guy in Carmen‚Äôs name - even if he resists, tells you ‚Äúno‚Äù and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.‚Äù Or, you can simply raise a fist, and quietly utter your favorite curse word in his honor.

1hjluia,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1hjluia/life_is_miserable_since_gerd/,Life is miserable since GERD ,"Long read.. 

Hello to all, 50/M/Retired Military here who is experiencing pretty bad GERD issues.

Backstory- 21 years in the military and took the prescribed 800mg ibuprofen 4X‚Äôs a day due to other injuries or issues which most likely caused my GERD. Always seemed to have heartburn or acid reflux throughout my 20‚Äôs-40‚Äôs‚Ä¶ started taking 20mg omeprazole daily around my late 30‚Äôs..  and that seemed to help a lot. 

Recently recovered from COVID in OCT2024 which made my GERD flare up a few times to a point I had to go to the ER because of the chest pain. 

I started taking 40mg Omeprazole and Carafate 4x a day prescribed by the doc. 

Lately my GERD issues and Acid Reflux haven‚Äôt been horrible but I‚Äôve now begun to have other extremely odd issues.  I constantly have dizzy spells/vertigo to the point I can barely walk straight, headaches all day, I‚Äôve had non stop pain in my ribs, shoulder blades, chest pains (bottom of the rib cage and top chest plate), burning in the chest, and feel a weird fluttering in my chest/throat (especially if I‚Äôm looking down with my chin to my chest).  I also have the ball in my throat feeling, and tend to have and feel my stomach and intestines twitch after eating ( never had that before). 

I started taking Magnesium for the dizzy spells and vitamin D for the muscle pains‚Ä¶ apparently long term PPI use can cause major depletion of magnesium and vitamin D. 

I drink close to a gallon of water a day, I only drink 20oz of coffee with half n half, I rarely drink alcohol and when I do it‚Äôs usually 2-3 bourbons on the rocks if that many sometimes just one. I rarely drink beer anymore. I do not smoke tobacco but I do have my medical cannabis card and used to smoke a joint every few days to help my PTSD and Depression. I‚Äôve stopped smoking cannabis since the new GERD issues and it‚Äôs definitely having an effect (in a bad way) on my PTSD. I now been micro dosing cannabis with  a vape but haven‚Äôt tried edibles since my GERD ER visit‚Ä¶    I try my hardest to stay away from fried foods and am aware of some of my triggers and yet I still have chest pains, indigestion, tiredness, mental fog, some muscle pain. 

I honestly am starting to hit my rock bottom because I feel this GERD isn‚Äôt getting better and it has affected my everyday life like no matter what I do.  I hate it!!! My demons are slowly getting their grips into me and making it harder to just enjoy life.  

I have an endo and colonoscopy scheduled 8JAN2025 and hope they can figure something out. 

Does anyone else have the same kind of issues? What are you doing to prevent or help with the issues? Any advice?!? Will this ever get better? Can I ever be normal again?!?!!  I am slowly hitting rock bottom and don‚Äôt know what to do!!!  
I feel like I have nowhere to turn. My friends and family listen to me but truly don‚Äôt understand because they don‚Äôt have these issues.  

I apologize for my rambling, I just need to vent and get this off my chest.  Just curious if there‚Äôs others like me out there‚Ä¶

1hjlrfv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hjlrfv,Need Advice: Real Estate Wants Us to Pay for Benchtop Replacement After 4-Year Tenancy ,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm looking for advice about a rental bond issue in Queensland. We recently vacated a property after living there for 5 years. Due to being busy with work and the purchase of our new home, we returned the keys before fully addressing some items flagged during the exit inspection.

One of the issues the real estate agent raised is the kitchen benchtop, which they say needs to be replaced because of stains. These stains likely came from normal use with a coffee machine and microwave. The material of the benchtop seems prone to staining over time, and we believe this is cosmetic wear, not actual damage.

Unfortunately, since we handed over the keys, we weren‚Äôt able to take photos of the benchtop before leaving. We‚Äôre worried they might try to deduct the cost of a full replacement from our bond.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd like advice on:

1. Do you think they have grounds to charge for a replacement, or does this fall under fair wear and tear?


2. How can we defend ourselves if this goes to the RTA, especially since we don‚Äôt have photos of the benchtop‚Äôs condition?


3. Any tips for negotiating with the real estate agent at this stage?


We are heading there today to identify the concerns identified for the outside area as we hired a mower to go in last week however did not hear back from him so aiming to fix up as required. We plan to refer to RTA guidelines on fair wear and tear, especially since the stains are from regular use over 5 years.

I get cold very easily (it's possibly a genetic condition as it's affected me most of my life) and as a result dislike colder temperatures unless I'm bundled up. Even when I am bundled up coat wise, however, my toes/fingers turn blue/go numb. Even when I am walking. It even happens if I'm at a coffee shop and sitting next to a cold window. I have to wear boots and gloves that are literally marketed for arctic temperatures for this to not happen if it's under 40 degrees.

In the past this hasn't been an issue because I've always had the motivation to get out anyway. Nowadays it seems like such a core to bundle up for a hike up Mount Everest just for a 45 minute jaunt around the neighborhood. I can motivate myself for hiking but that's not an everyday thing.

I had a treadmill and use it to jog/walk on but it isn't the same and I always feel guilty about not going outside and getting what little sun there is. But I hate going outside when it is this cold.

I think this has to do with age.

I learned to deal with my panic, I got better at handling my constant anxious state, even started drinking coffee again. Well fast forward to now, 

I‚Äôm constantly clenching my body again, I‚Äôm always fatigued, every little thing makes me feel anxious again And the brain fog has come back in horrid waves to the point it causes dissociation attacks.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it‚Äôs you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength‚ÄîI wish I‚Äôd had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There‚Äôs so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it‚Äôs not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian‚Äîyour mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she‚Äôs gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I‚Äôve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I‚Äôm certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup‚Äôs rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn‚Äôt know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you‚Äôll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I‚Äôm deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea‚Äôs trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, ‚ÄúW-what does this mean?‚Äù

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. ‚ÄúNot here, not now. Let‚Äôs get home, then we can talk.‚Äù

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother‚Äôs shrill voice called after them, ‚ÄúLeaving already? You haven‚Äôt stayed for lunch.‚Äù

Sorin‚Äôs jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.‚Äù With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúDamn it, damn it, damn it.‚Äù

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea‚Äôs gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

‚ÄúD-do you‚Ä¶ think this could really be true?‚Äù Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. ‚ÄúLook, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might‚Äôve signed, we‚Äôll have proof.‚Äù He paused, deep in thought. ‚ÄúDad must have something lying around.‚Äù A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. ‚ÄúWhy did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could‚Äôve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!‚Äù

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt really know what was going on back then‚Ä¶‚Äù

A sob erupted from him. ‚ÄúI loved him so much, Drea. I don‚Äôt remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end‚Ä¶‚Äù

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another‚Äôs embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, ‚ÄúCall Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.‚Äù

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn‚Äôt rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! That woman is going to pay today. I‚Äôve tolerated her long enough!‚Äù He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

‚ÄúAdrian, no!‚Äù

Like no, not everybody is an idiot or a bad person for not doing the exact perfect thing or the ""smart"" thing in any given scenario. There doesn't always need to be a clear cut good guy and villain, or intelligent person and dumbass. Sometimes people simply have bad days or are put into a situation where they don't have the opportunity to think as clearly as they normally would. Also, sometimes there's literally nothing nefarious going on and we as the observers are projecting our own bullshit onto something innocuous and seeing underlying issues that literally aren't fucking there lmfao.

I mean look at how antsy we as a collective get to scrutinize people in videos for doing literally fucking anything. It could be a video of an interaction as mundane as, idk, someone casually ordering coffee at a coffee shop. ""Oh the customer is a Karen,"" or ""ugh, I hate the cashier's attitude."" It can never just be two people existing. Or even look at a lot of the posts and responses on subreddits like AITA, or really any post on any platform involving someone asking for advice on a personal situation involving another person. Like....does there always have to be an asshole in the first place? Does there always have to be someone doing an unequivocally unjustifiable mega bad thing that makes them a meanie/dumbass? Our minds are conditioned to see things in black and white, to create a good guy/bad guy ""non-toxic"" ""toxic"" dichotomy, even if it (let's face it, especially if it) requires overemphasizing problems or generating them out of thin air. People are complex. People are flawed. ""Good people"" can have ""bad"" moments and ""bad people"" can have ""good moments."" Why? Because we're actual human beings and not fucking character archetypes. We're not always going to smoothly fit into one category or another.

I don't even blame people for being so morally binary because I have been there and probably will be there in some capacity in the future. It's an easy trap to fall into. But for fuck's sake. Have empathy. It's easier for all of us to do so.",1,1734822220.0,rant,0,1.0,False

You all did have me nervous about the withdrawals but it was only seven days. I took magnesium and NAC and Agmatine. I had headaches, pain in my back and legs, and horrible shooting pains. But once these lifted on day 7, I was good to go.

I've noticed that on many of those first (or second) dates, I've keyed in on one or two little things that bother me, then glommed onto them and been unable to let them go. I'm wondering if I might be self-sabotaging, or if I'm actually notice things that would be considered yellow or even red flags.

Here are some examples:

* On our second date, man A tried to get me to move to a different position while ordering coffee by saying, ""How about we stand where we *actually* order,"" when there was no one else in line and I was still just looking at the menu. (At the end of this date, he revealed that he was still in the process of getting a divorce.)
* On our second date, man B asked me about a project I'm excited about. I was getting really into explaining it when he cut me off by putting his hands up and telling me to ""slow down!"" and that I was ""getting ahead of myself"". (After our 3rd date he ghosted me after we'd agreed to go out a 4th time.)
* On our first date, man C kept telling me I should have more to eat than what I'd just ordered. Finally, I assured him I was more than sated and that I'd actually brought snacks with me so I'd be fine. He asked me what I brought so I showed him my dark chocolate bar, nuts, and Chomps meat sticks. He immediately said ""You shouldn't eat that crap!"" in reference to the meat sticks.

On all three of these dates, things went really well otherwise and I found them all attractive. In fact, man C and I are planning a second date for next week...but I keep coming back to his comments about my eating. 

Please be honest: Does it sound like I'm just finding things to nitpick out of fear, or is my gut telling me, ""Hey, watch out! If they say these kinds of things on date 1, imagine year 5""? Curious if anyone else does this, and also whether I'm sabotaging or saving myself!

Adderall made me too wired in and I felt a little catatonic like if I could not move nor speak. We suspect it may be boosting my Dopamine too much and we are passing the sweet spot. We are going to try Wellbutrin based a little off of the fact that coffee ameliorates my symptoms quite a bit already but I am looking for further positive effect and quite honestly, I am a bit scared of the long term cardiovascular risks of stimulants like Adderall and Ritalin(would suck to unfortunately succumb to a heart attack or stroke thanks to the stimulants in spite of the positive things they may do for me mentally). If I cannot acquire brand name Wellbutrin, what are the best possible generics available?",0,1734821938.0,bupropion,1,0.5,False

ich hab den gezeigten PC vor ein paar Jahren zusammengestellt bekommen. Insbesondere da Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 bald raus kommt und ich auch gerne allgemein in 4K zocken m√∂chte √ºberlege ich eine 4080 Super anzuschaffen. Dazu brauch ich noch einen neuen  Monitor aber das soll eine Frage f√ºr einen anderen Tag sein.

ChatGPT sagt  mir, es w√ºrde kein Bottlelneck entstehen, da der Rest vom Rechner noch so passt. Jetzt kamen bei meinen Recherchen aber Kommentare wie ""neee, wart lieber auf die Neuen"" und ich muss dazu sagen, ich hab nicht so wirklich Ahnung davon.

Was sind eure Meinungen? 4080 Super gute Idee?
