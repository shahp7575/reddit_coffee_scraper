1g349js,https://i.redd.it/5mf984trcmud1.jpeg,Please help me work through my rage over these bubbles,"I've been working with resin for 3 years for playscale miniatures. I just started collecting miniverse a year ago.

Tonight I decided to do one of my two tequila sets that I was going to trade because I was jonesing for a craft. 

I lightly warmed the resin in hot water. I poured it into the shot glasses that I had rimmed. I did use Lets Resin clear resin to rim the glasses with the salt and it had been successfully set.I gently tapped the shot glasses to let any potential bubbles rise to the surface and saw none. I let the shot glasses, with the resin in them, sit on a warming disc (I think one of those old school coffee cup warmers) set to low for 15 minutes.  I checked them and there were no bubbles. I let them sit  the counter  without the heat for another 15 minutes and verified there were still no bubbles. This is the process I take for every single resin project where the resin is the centerpiece of the craft construction. Drinks, shakes, soups, etc. it has never failed me.

After this whole process I moved my BUBBLE FREE shot glasses to my UV light. 

They cured with multiple bubbles. 

No apparent bubbles through the entire process. Bubbles after curing.

AAAAAAHHHHH!!! WHY?

Over a week ago she shoots me a message saying something had been bothering her for quite some time now and wanted to talk about it over the phone (we live like 1.5 hrs away from each other).

She took issue with me liking various posts on Instagram by female friends of mine (understandable) and felt disrespected by it. I apologized but she seemed to heavily imply that wouldn't be just a slap on the wrist for me and could very well be the end for us.

We had already broken up once back late August but she forgave me for what I did (That was way worse) as she said she saw potential in us. Will the same happen here?

The timing for when she decided to bring this up couldn't have worse though. I was leaving for a wedding trip in Italy the very next day she brings this up to me. She felt bad that she said it when she did but she also didn't want to wait a week as it was bugging her.

Add on to the fact her that life has ""paused"" for lack of a better word as her mother is in hospital and nearly died two weeks ago. She's thankfully in a stable condition and is slowly recovering but it's taken most of her time. I've gone and visited a few times and have even offered to help look after her dog on many occasions and do other errands for her. We haven't really been a ""couple"" since like Mid September.

And I totally get why and have offered as much support as I can. Realistically there is only so much I can actually do and sometimes taking a step back to asses the situation can do wonders. I'm patient, I can wait as long as I need to.

Needless to say this was hanging over my head the entire trip like a noose. Yet during my trip we were still messaging each other and it was like nothing had happened? She's sending me emojis, asking how the trip is going, I asked her if she wanted anything and she said Coffee so I got her that. It was kinda weird not gonna lie.

At one point I got very emotional during the wedding and messaged how much I missed her and that I hoped we could pull through this rough patch and she seemed to agree with it.

Then I finally came home and we started talking over the phone. I brought up what she had said last week and how much I was thinking about it and she seemed to imply that this is most likely it for us again but weirdly didn't seem to want to say it? Last time she just said it plain and simple and that was it.

But now she seems to be avoiding it? We didn't get to any solid conclusion with our phone call so it ended but she did agree to another one later that day. I waited until about 8pm and she said ""Having game night with roommates, we will talk another time.""

So Now I'm just confused if anything. I'm half tempted to message her saying ""Are we done or no?"" just to get some sort of solid answer rather than sit here and play guessing games.",1,1728866697.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

1g345sk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1g345sk/a_new_friend_was_giving_me_mixed_signals_and_just/,"A new friend was giving me mixed signals and just started seeing a girl, I still have a crush on him, what do I do? ","
I(18 f), just became friends with this guy (19m) that Im in a club with at my college. There was a meeting last saturday and him and I were the only two there. We ended up pretty much just talking for like three hours and it was really nice. He mentioned how he did not have a girlfriend. I went to get coffee on campus on Tuesday, and he ordered coffee at the same time as me. We said hello, he already had a seat and went to sit down, and I sat down at a seperate table because I didnt want to assume that he wanted to see me outside of the club. He then grabbed his stuff, and came over to sit with me. We got work done and talked for about an hour and a half. Thursday it was a similar deal, except I went and sat down with him. During this time he mentioned something off handedly about how he needed to get a new haircut and if he had a girlfriend he would just let her pick his haircut. I thought that this was kind of a way of him restating that he didnt have a girlfriend so that I would know he was single.

Thursday night, we had a club meeting which I went to. He was leaving early to go see his friend at open mic night and I asked if I could come with. He said yes, and when we got there he stood pretty close to me and then when we got seats he kept leaning over to talk to me. Eventually we left, and he was about to head back to his dorm. I asked him how to get on top of one of the buildings on campus so I could see the northern lights, he had previously mentioned how he would go up there. Instead of just telling me where to go, he went up with me and we talked for like twenty minutes before climbing back down and him going back to his dorm.

Saturday we had another club meeting, and it was just me and him. I was getting ready to see if he maybe wanted to go on a date with me on monday, but he brought up how he had a date the day before that went pretty well. We kept talking and he mentioned how he had another this coming Tuesday and then Friday with the same girl. I was really disappointed but obviously didnt say anything. We kept talking and he asked me if there was anyone I liked on campus, I said yes but they really werent an option. He eventually guessed it was because they were in a relationship(he did not explicitly say he was dating this girl, but he said their date went well so I still feel like the rules are the same). He asked me if I could wait it out, and I said that I didnt know how long they would be together. He then told me that I should try and see someone. He said some things that I thought were a little odd to say to someone when youre seeing someone else. He mentioned how he seriously doubted any guy would say no to going on a date with me. When I asked him why he thought that, because that had not been my experience, he said that he didnt have a good way to answer that.

He is now focused on helping me find a guy to go out with. He invited me to hang out with him and his friends that night, which I did, because he said he thought I would like one of them. Im just kind of confused? I was really under the impression that he was flirting with me the entire week leading up to him having his date, which he never even mentioned. I obviously dont want to tell him I like him, because if hes seeing a girl and he likes her, which it seems like he does, then it would be really wrong to tell him that. I also like being his friend. I like him because hes so easy to talk to, and hes funny and really nice. Sometimes I just look at him, and pay attention to some of the things he does and says and think it would be so incredibly easy to get used to them. I dont know what to do here. I want to keep being his friend, and I realize that to do that, I cannot tell him how I feel. I also dont want to put myself in a situation where Im pining after someone in a relationship. I realize that his next few dates could hypothetically go poorly, but it feels wrong to hope for that and it feels very unlikely. I cannot imagine how the girl he is seeing wouldnt like him.

Id really appreciate if I could get some opinions on what to do here? I want to keep being friends with him, I dont want to be a bad person and tell him how I feel while hes seeing someone, but I also dont want to keep liking him more and more. Im worried about complicating things if I were to tell him, as I enjoy being in the club Im in with him, and think meetings would be really really awkward, if(and when) me telling him went poorly. I want to make sure Im being respectful of him and the girl hes seeing, but I also dont want to put myself in a bad situation by liking someone that I cant be with.

I'm not officially diagnosed from an endoscopy yet but all the symptoms I have had are similar to what I read about HH. I'm 21M and I cut out coffee and energy drinks (which I used to drink 1-2x everyday), but still chew 2-3 pieces of Military Energy Gum (200-300 mg of caffeine which admittedly, I shouldn't do but they're definitely doing me better than the coffee/energy drinks). 

The symptoms I had at first were absolutely miserable. These would include:

- burping over 10x every minute whenever I had flare-ups (otherwise, just burping more than I'd like to throughout the day)   - very noticeable clicking sensation every time I swallowed    - feeling like I couldn't take a deep breath    - weird ""air bubble"" sensations anywhere from my left rib cage to my upper chest     - stiff throat/neck sensation     - tingling in my right arm     - feeling like my throat has something lodged in it     - trouble swallowing, feeling like it gets caught somewhere around my left rib cage             - sharp pain in my left rib cage area

  
The list goes on. Trust me, I feel like every once in a while a new symptoms pops up and I think ""Huh. That one's new"", but the list I posted above are what I experienced on a day-to-day basis. Compared to what I experienced back in April/May however, I genuinely can't tell if my symptoms have gotten better or if I just began to get used to this. When I look at some of the posts on this subreddit, I even doubt sometimes if I truly have this or if it's just GERD from another problem because people seem to be experiencing so much worse. I don't control my diet, spicy foods are decently regular for me, I go to the gym(running/weightlifting), and I honestly have gained a decent amount of weight from bulking.

  
I still do have a lot of symptoms, but it doesn't affect me as much mentally. I remember my symptoms used to cause me so much anxiety but I honestly cannot tell if this is starting to improve (if that's even possible), or if it's been going on for some time and I've honestly just gotten used to it and therefore my anxiety surrounding it isn't as bad.

Robert Duke was the top Holonet personality in sector 47, his series “It's a Human thing” had had huge success in the region of space he now lived in, Human being very rare and information on them scarce to say the least.

It was a simple show really, he would stream his daily life as a graphic designer and answer as many questions as his now extremely large audience would ask of him, within reason that is...

“No, I'm not telling you the name of my girlfriend! Come on Humanititties you know better than that!”

A myriad of comments flooded his chat, many making fun of Humanititties, others wanting to know as well, some uninterested, etc. The responses were as varied as the number of people watching, even those who shared the same views always differentiated themselves with their own custom holographic “Dukies” looped animations of Duke in his more famous or infamous moments.

Today he was having a chat with his viewers concerning the first annual meet up, a large hobby convention was taking place in the nearby retail station and he was the guest of honor.

His doorbell rang.

“Sorry guys, gals and everything in between that's her right now, I'll see you all tomorrow! Duke signing out!”

He got up from his comfy chair at speed, it sat in front of nearly wall to wall screen and made his way through the very neat and proper apartment he occupied and as he opened the door Sheila greeted him with a hug.

She looked behind him at the gently spinning chair.“Still streaming? I get that for the last 3 years you've made more than enough money to quit your day job but you're meeting them tomorrow, you can skip a day you know.”

Duke snorted. “Come on, I owe them at least that much! I make 4 times as much as I ever did as a designer while playing the latest holonovel or having a meal with hot sauce! Besides not all of them can make it, guys like TotallyaHuman.” Duke moved to the large screen that was his computer and brought up a picture of a vaguely elf like humanoid a Silos. “That's him, made third in the electro-blade tournament last year.” When he turned to look at Sheila he paused, she looked troubled. “What's wrong?”

“That's fake...”

Duke tilted his head. “Why would you say that?”

“My brother competes, that model he has in hand? That hasn't been legal for decades.”

Duke shrugged. “Well, maybe he's shy and didn't feel like sharing a real photo of him.”

But as they left for diner Duke wondered why Totally would do that, he'd been one of his early fans and was the reason he got his first big collab with the Arthurian hunter Severs Bonds And Flesh.

He'd had a hard time acclimating with his fast rise to celebrity status, which is why he lived the life of a recluse, few even knew where he lived and everything he owned was ordered and left on his doorstep by automated carrier. Today was one of the rare times he was leaving his apartment to have a quiet meal in a high end restaurant with his girlfriend, so he pushed the thought to the side.

*Maybe I'll look into it later tonight.*

\*\*\*

Sheila left Duke's bedroom and made her way to the kitchen, Duke wasn't in bed but she was used to him getting up early to prepare for his streams. As she made herself a cup of coffee she heard something shatter and carefully followed where she had heard the noise. “Something wrong...Hon...” She saw her clean freak, everything in it's place boyfriend, disheveled, looking like he hadn't slept all night throwing the very expensive paper pictures of some of his biggest Holo creator awards. As he began to dig through the broken glass for the pictures, cutting himself in the process she rushed to stop him. “STOP!”

Duke looked at her and through her and managed a single word: “...^(fake)...”

She held him by the shoulders and looked him in the eyes and took a deep breath to calm herself before speaking. “What's fake?”

Duke spread his hands all around him. “Everything, it's all lies, I don't...”

“Hon you're not making sense, let me see your hands.”

Before she could take a good look, Duke freed himself from her hold and picked a picture off the floor. “You see this? The reward from achieving a holovid with over a million views within a standard hour.”

She'd known about it of course, he spoke proudly of it when he had first shown it to her, it was that holovid that had launched his career, she nodded her head.

“There is no such reward, at least not before 3 years ago, I was looking into the fake picture I showed you last night when I noticed something...” He sat on his streaming chair and pulled at his hair. “The accounts of all my viewers, they're not real! There is something wrong with all of them, like a reflection that shows something that shouldn't be there in a picture or... Or background noise that repeats in holovids from people in different planets! They... They talk only to each-other, it's all bots talking to bots! ”

Sheila looked worried, like she didn't know what to say or do but she clearly felt the need to do something. “What about the collabs, those HAD to be real right? Or the money! You make tons of credits those can't be faked!”

Duke looked up to her, tears in his eyes. “I never met any of them, we did our part of the holovids on our own and then edit them into a seamless narrative... As for the money...” He took a pensive look and looked confused. “That's right, the money, the money's real... The money is real!”

Sheila let out a heavy sigh. “See, there's nothing to worry about, why don't you go take a shower and get ready to meet your fans?”

Duke shook his head. “No, I don't think I can, I'll apologize and reimburse everyone... I can't go through with it, I just can't...”

The screen that was Duke's computer lit up and he turned around to see why, only to be greeted by his chat, the millions of handles that constituted his viewer base saying a single sentence, in the same font, with no deviation or any of the idiosyncrasies associated with any of them: “You will come meet me.”

Duke was shaking in his seat, unsure on what to do, what to say, what to think.

The message changed and he couldn't stop from reading it out loud.

“After all.. I am... Your biggest...”

“Fan.” Finished Sheila.

\*\*\*

“Hello friends! Today on Bob The Destroyer we're going to go over the disappearance of one Robert Duke a 32 year old Human graphic designer and one Sheila Thomson 27 both seemingly having vanished into fat-air after moving to our good old sector 47, no information or records of any kind on these individuals could be found after they left their planet of birth, authorities are baffled. Damn that's freaky! We'll go over the details right after a word from our sponsor!”

As he got ready to read from the scripted commercial, Bob looked at his chat, all those thousands of people commenting in their own unique ways and smiled at how fast his channel was growing and thought it good.

They have money but no power, they as poor as they are rich. I'm smiling as I'm bringing coffee but I'm wet as hell when I'm bringing them to task.

I've done good for myself, I got what I need, I made what I have...and I can have what I want ...yet I find myself surrounded by these Bond boys. You know how scrimpy and spendy they are lol the amt of coke on their fucking pink faces.

I want to wring them, yet I am seriously attracted to their slim frames slight muscle and silly comeons, something about a pale ass executive in a white shirt just gets me.  As a golden skinned beach goddess I had to fight them off when I started, they never met someone like me and that was fun, Flipping my dark long ponytail in their faces, using my warm voice to turn them on, when they press 0 to find some fucking file. 

That was fun for a bit. I got a kick out of being clueless, virginal, sultry, soft. In my mind I am giving them the slow pegging of their life. 

That's what I'm thinking laughing at their jokes, showing guests to their desks. 

I have disdain for you, stock boys, trading pokemon cards and praying for moass lol

The loss of discipline I see with every little flutter of RC tweet, I'm rolling my eyes because y'all have no SUBSTANCE. What the fuck is the point of making the money and just rolling in it like a pig.

I (F23) live with my mom, dad and brother (M21). My brother used to be a very social person, he was popular in high school and had lots of friends. He wasn’t always the friendliest but we used to be close. He would hangout with his friend’s often to the point he’d disappear for days at a time (smoking weed and presumably doing drugs) but he was social. He would attend all the family parties and holidays. Then he dropped out of high school at 16. My parents always babied him a lot, and it was always tough love on me, maybe because i was the oldest. Slowly my brother became reclusive. I don’t even remember how it started off. He had a job at Walmart and then quit it. For the last three years my brother had changed. He hasn’t stepped foot outside the home not even the backyard for fresh air. I always told my parents even begged them to just stop enabling him, get him help. They always made the excuse that he’s just going through a phase. My dad buys him fast food whenever he wants it, i suspect he’s even giving him money. He smokes weed everyday, how he gets it I don’t know, my mom says he just saved up a lot from Walmart. My parents say they just pray and hope he’ll wake up one day. One time I asked my brother why he is so reclusive. He told me it’s became every time he leaves the house people look and watch him. He thinks people see his ethnicity (Guatemalan/Peruvian) and think the worst of him, he told me it’s because paranoia and racism. He told me this years ago. I’m not sure if it was true or not. I thought maybe he got into trouble with the wrong people or something but the more i learned about him the more my reasonings for why changed. I used to find searches like “guys kissing, gay guys making out” on his tablet but this was years and years ago. He’s never had a girlfriend that I know of. About 3 years ago my mom approached me crying telling me Chris was sleeping and he saw him wearing a skirt. I spoke to her and told her whatever he wants to be its okay and our love won’t disappear and she agreed but we never mentioned it to him. He always had anger issues but they became more and more severe as time went by. He would scream, yell, threaten and borderline push my mom. We always avoided making him angry because he could get violent. There were times we physically fought and i was genuinely scared. The last time he left the house he actually made a big step. He and my mom went to Peru for 2 weeks. He went out and hung out with my cousin for a week until he left town. After that he stayed in his room the whole time. My aunt told me in private that he controls my mom as one time she upset him and began to yell then lock himself inside her room. My mom then started crying a lot. He came back and became reclusive again. It’s been like this for years. One night I got extremely drunk and went to his room crying telling him about all my traumas and hardships. I always felt like I had some type of addition to his current state. I was touched inappropriately by one of my uncles while my brother was right next to me. I was around 10 or 11. It wasn’t crazy it was just my uncle rubbing my thigh and leg as i was wearing shorts. My brother was sitting next to him on the couch. My cousin on my side. My cousin then told me to never say anything because he would get kicked out and I never did. I always felt like maybe I had traumatised him. When i was drunk talking to him, he told me he didn’t remember that at all and that i shouldn’t cry. After that he was sort of nice to me and stayed downstairs more often. but then it got bad again. He doesn’t look at me let alone talk to me. Today I hit the breaking point. When i have a friend over its usually for 1 or 2 hours so he stays locked in his room. Yesterday I asked my fathers permission to have my friend over so I can color her hair. He agreed on one condition I don’t bother my brother. I told him anytime he wants to come down and use the bathroom that we would go into my room and stay silent until he’s done. My friend came over around 8 and i texted him informing him of the plan. He never responded. The process which i thought would take maybe 4 hours max ended up taking a lottt longer than that. Around 12 I became concerned my brother never texted me. I started to text him that we would be locked in my room silent for 30 minutes even. It got bad and I became worried. I walked into his room with a hot coffee asking him if he needed the bathroom he yelled at me “GET OUT! GET OUT!” he kept screaming and as I left he looked at me with this look of pure hate like he wanted to kill me. He’s given me this look a couple times before when I got him angry. I am very gentle around him as I never wanna make him mad. My friend and I became silent. I then told her to come to my room and locked my door. I told her we’d wait half an hour until so he comes down. I texted him to let him know. We were completely quiet. He never responded. Theres a dunkin’ donuts in front of my house, i told my friend we should go there for half an hour. Keep in mind my friend had foil, bleach and a whole towel covering he’d head. She was extremely uncomfortable. I then suggested we can go inside my mom’s car and pretend we left. We stayed in my mom’s car where i apologised profusely. I was on the verge of crying because this was so embarrassing. She reassured me told me she understood. My dad pulls up after that, and from the car door i tell him my brother won’t go downstairs. He goes inside and i’m hoping he will help Chris. He then texted me that we need to be done soon. The hair color she wanted was gonna take a longtime and I didn’t prepare for my brother to act that way. My friend’s family is also very dysfunctional but she told me we could try to go to hers. She stayed inside the car while I grabbed all her things and all the items to finish up her hair. My dad felt bad and he drove us to her house. He kept asking me if it’ll be okay and to text him when i’m done. We got to her home and my friend was completely shocked, she was astounded she had heard of agoraphobia but she never saw anything like this to such an extent. He refused to even leave his room when there was a different presence around. He held in his urine and feces I imagine for HOURS. I offered him so many opportunities to go downstairs but he refused. It didn’t help that I was completely unwelcome at my friend’s house by her parents. Her father before leaving for church blatantly told me “stay in your house instead” with a smile. My friend and her sister were in shock he could say that to me. They apologised. It’s been about 10 hours at this point since we began. I finally finished my friends hair not too long ago and at least it came out absolutely beautiful. I’m really at a loss for words at this point. He’s never been diagnosed by anyone as he refuses medical or psychological help. My parents have done nothing but enable him. I am extremely concerned by his behaviour and in complete shock. What can I do? Where do I go from here? I love my brother but this is beyond. I tried to get him to go to a psychiatrist, I begged him for just one appointment. Nothing works.

1g3410u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/1g3410u/severe_agoraphobia/,Severe Agoraphobia?,"I (F23) live with my mom, dad and brother (M21). My brother used to be a very social person, he was popular in high school and had lots of friends. He wasn’t always the friendliest but we used to be close. He would hangout with his friend’s often to the point he’d disappear for days at a time (smoking weed and presumably doing drugs) but he was social. He would attend all the family parties and holidays. Then he dropped out of high school at 16. My parents always babied him a lot, and it was always tough love on me, maybe because i was the oldest. Slowly my brother became reclusive. I don’t even remember how it started off. He had a job at Walmart and then quit it. For the last three years my brother had changed. He hasn’t stepped foot outside the home not even the backyard for fresh air. I always told my parents even begged them to just stop enabling him, get him help. They always made the excuse that he’s just going through a phase. My dad buys him fast food whenever he wants it, i suspect he’s even giving him money. He smokes weed everyday, how he gets it I don’t know, my mom says he just saved up a lot from Walmart. My parents say they just pray and hope he’ll wake up one day. One time I asked my brother why he is so reclusive. He told me it’s became every time he leaves the house people look and watch him. He thinks people see his ethnicity (Guatemalan/Peruvian) and think the worst of him, he told me it’s because paranoia and racism. He told me this years ago. I’m not sure if it was true or not. I thought maybe he got into trouble with the wrong people or something but the more i learned about him the more my reasonings for why changed. I used to find searches like “guys kissing, gay guys making out” on his tablet but this was years and years ago. He’s never had a girlfriend that I know of.

1g340s3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIActuallyTheAsshole/comments/1g340s3/aita_for_dropping_a_friend_due_to_her_mental/,AITA for dropping a friend due to her mental health,"Okay so to start with I have a friend or I guess ex friend and we will call her Lena. We have been friends for 6 years and I introduced her to her now husband Jeff. I was a bridesmaid in her wedding. Honestly? I regret it now. This post deals with mental health pretty intensely as a heads up. All parties are safe now in this moment

Lena struggles with something called borderline personality disorder as well as histrionic personality disorder, PTSD and ADHD. She struggles with alcohol and smokes weed excessively to the point she will fall asleep at parties. 

A bit about me is I struggle with being a recoverying addict in sustained remission, have pretty severe PTSD, as well as bipolar disorder and happen to work in the mental health field. I've gotten treatment and it's my passion helping other people get through what they are going through but it does require a lot of energy to stay healthy so I can do that.

There are three big incidents I need to get off my chest as I'm feeling guilty and need to know if I screwed up 

1) Last year Lena and Jeff went on their first big vacation together. She got too drunk, ran away, called me saying she was going to go swim away into the ocean forever. I was in another country and she would not tell me where she was, confirm her safety or anything like that. I sent a screenshot of her location to Jeff who found her, thanked me and I thought that would be that. Nope. 
Jeff calls me back saying Lena is on the deck of their 5th floor place making threats and that she was hurting him physically. They were on FaceTime and shattered glass and blood was everywhere. She took a piece and..... while looking right into the camera. He proceeded to follow suit yelling ""this is what it feels like when you do that in front of me"".  It was chaos. I called their parents, their siblings anyone who knew where they were but nothing. I had to send paramedics by calling from another country after finding their location on Snapchat. Once they were home Jeff stayed with us and Lena stayed with her parents. Jeff has very little family support so we are like surrogates that way for him. I didnt speak to her for six months as I was pretty traumatized not going to lie. Jeff's reaction was more reactionary and it is not part of his usual response to anything ever, so we worked it out.

2) This past summer Jeff called me asking if I had heard from Lena and if I could please call her. We had patched things up a bit, though no where near as close as we used to be but I was always good at calming her down. I guess they had a fight and I talked her down, thought that was that. Jeff called me back asking where she was, if she still had the dog and asked if she had told me she was drunk. She refused to tell anyone her location, threatened her own livelihood and would not pull over or answer her phone. So I called the cops. She was found on my deck in my complex covered in mud, with her dog, drinks spilled all over, huge injury to her leg, screaming and banging on my door to let her in. Called back police, got no charges as I mentioned her BPD and got her husband to pick her up. She had also crashed her car to the point it was not drivable. I lost most of my respect for her in the moment.  What if her dog got hurt? What if an innocent were harmed? Her rationale was if everyone hated her she could disappear from the world and it wouldn't hurt anyone. 

She proceeded to cuss out her mother on Mother's day causing another police file to be opened and tried to jump out of her vehicle on the way to the psych ward.... a whole hullabaloo that I being the people pleaser I was with poor work/life balance and boundaries at the time. Dealt with from start to finish as I was worried sick and she proceeded to self injure and texted me saying it was my fault. She took some pills, required sedation by the nurses after taking apart a pop can and using it.... just a nightmare. I again took some space for myself and really started to question the friendship

So with that background in mind, here is where I might be the asshole

3) I threw her sister Megan, who is also a close friend of mine, a birthday party this year. Only 6 people total including us and our partners were there. Super low key just snacks, movies and a few games and chitchat. Please note, I also had a party for Lena's birthday and invited the people she wanted there. Megan was still struggling with what happened during incident 2 and we decided to not invite Lena this time around, with Megan intending to meet her 1 on 1. Lena hadn't been getting treatment consistently for her condition and could be rather volatile especially in group situations where the attention is focused not on her as harsh as that sounds.

 Party went off without a hitch, however as I kind of expected I recieved from Lena a text saying ""I can't believe you wouldn't invite me to my own sisters birthday Im hurt"". At first I tried to be validating and explain it was a small get together, that I had just followed the provided guest list I was given and that her sister was hoping to do something with her personally. That didn't go well. I proceeded to get messages saying that that was bullshit, that I was disrespectful to her and that I was rude. I told her just because she wasn't invited this time doesn't mean I dont want her at future events, just that things were being kept small this time.

At that point I asked her to call me so we could talk out, again validating she was upset but explaining the day was about Megan and what she wantedd, not her. She proceeded to say that I had deliberately excluded her and that I had hidden it from her purposefully, despite us having a conversation already about it which she stated to have not remembered. She stated she felt alone and like she doesn't matter or deserve anything in her life. I reminded her Megan was excited to see her still and that she had made plans already. I explained that Megan only wanted me and her other best friend Paul and partners that night for board games and such and that many people did not recieve an invite, this included two of her other best friends. She continued to tell me that I was spewing bullshit. I at this point tried to stop the conversation from progressing by asking if we could take a break and grab a coffee to talk in person later in the week and fully talk things through. 

She then started attacking me as a person telling me she always has to walk on eggshells around me as shes too much for me, that she has to hide her emotions as I can't handle them, that I'm manipulative for saying that my own feelings were being hurt with the way she was speaking to me. Specifically said ""If I voice my displeasure with you, you turn it around and make it my fault for expressing my feelings THIS IS MANIPULATIVE AND HURTS ME MORE THAN IT WILL EVER HURT YOU."" She said I don't appreciate all the things she does for me, sending me a picture of a sign she had make me for my bathroom that included the name of my old drug of choice (recoverying addict I don't want to be triggered every time I take a bath lol). Either way I thanked her for her time and effort but again asked when we could talk in person or over the phone trying to call her, yet goes to voicemail.

 At this point Im starting to get pissed, my phone is blowing up with text message after text message about how I'm never there, that it's like Im a different person since I went to treatment yadayada. I laid my boundaries out very clearly as I learned to in treatment and said hey you need to understand that despite you struggling as well, supporting you through traumatic situations is hard on me and I can't be the type of support you expect of me anymore. 

She said every time I help her by keeping her alive I just make it worse, that I'm a gossip as I called people to support her and look out for her, and that I think she's stupid and again started beating herself up saying she doesn't deserve life and so on. She tends to do this ofter where she will things like ""If I ended it you wouldn't even cry"" and things like that, generally to gauge a reaction and get her needs met. I don't get pulled into this behaviour as it's not healthy for anyone involved.

So with that context, after attempting one last call over 3 days of my phone blowing up with things that were really hurtful I sent the following 

""So I cant stop you and you're allowed to slit your .......in front of me on FaceTime? To show up at my home after driving drunk? To be blamed for you hurting yourself on multiple occasions without any thought of where I'm at? Im done and I'm not dealing with this anymore. I tell people because your life matters in an emergency. If I left it you'd lose it for me not caring or be dead. I've tried to be civil but I just can't do this friendship anymore its not healthy. I won't be shit talking you or your life to our mutuals, but this I think is where our roads need to split.  If we run into eachother I'll keep it chill but this is not going to work out at this time.  Maybe with time and distance. But not now.""

She finally called me and I purposefully let it go to voicemail responding with ""What do you want? You couldn't bother to call me until now? Everyone has a breaking point"". 

So guys 

Am I the asshole? I feel like I might be as she is unstable and maybe I should have been the bigger person and shown more patience. Maybe we should have just bit the bullet and invited her. Maybe I should have cut her off earlier. I feel guilty and semi want to reach out as we were close for a long time just to check in as I know she's ill right now and likely got caught up in the emotions of one of her episodes. But I also need to take care of myself first and foremost.

Since I got back to my apartment late around 2am, I put my earbuds in as to not disturb my neighbors. 

About an hour later, in a half-dream state I thought I was choking on a pill and reflexively swallowed it. As soon as I did, my eyes shot open as I realized I couldn’t have swallowed a pill. My right earbud was on my chest but my left earbud was nowhere to be found. I was still groggy but I turned on my flashlight and started looking around the couch. 10 minutes of searching later and still nothing. Fearing the worst, I tried to make myself throw up but I all I got was bad heartburn. So, I did what any normal person would do, I drank a bunch of coffee and contemplated the life choices that led me to this point while waiting for urgent care to open. 

A few hours and incredulous doctors later, I have some beautiful x-rays of my abdomen and a referral to the ER in case the battery in the earbud is dissolved in my stomach acid. Unfortunately they gave me my x-rays on a cd so I’ll have to find a computer with a cd player before I can show off my stupidity. If anyone has any laxatives they’ve been meaning to try let me know and I’ll be happy to report back.

TL;DR I reflexively swallowed my earbud while asleep and now I get to spend my holiday weekend trying laxatives and searching for a cd player. ",9,1728865864.0,tifu,2,1.0,False

1g33uyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1g33uyp/i_think_its_time_i_stop/,I think it’s time I stop. ,"It’s time. Probably way overdue that I stop drinking. I have become way too dependent on it. My justification was that it never interfered with my job, parenting duties, and marriage (or so I thought). My wife approached me a couple of weeks ago and said how she noticed I was drinking most nights after work. I admitted that I was and that I shouldn’t be drinking as much. I took a few days off, but then I went back to drinking. 

Here are a few things that I have done that I’m a little ashamed of, but I feel this community understands.  

1. Taking a few chugs from a liquor bottle quickly while the family is in another room. 

2. Putting some water in a liquor bottle so no one notices the level went down. 

3. Buying small liquor bottles to fill up the bigger bottles, and then disposing of the evidence. 

4. Secretly downing a couple of shots before going to a get together and then of course drinking more when I get there.

5. Waking up and having a few STIFF Irish coffees or 3 and then having a few beers later even though I truly didn’t feel like drinking. Repeat for a few mornings because I had a day off and then the weekend with lots of football watching. 

So, long story long, I need to stop now. I just LOVE it too much. I’m not looking forward to outings where others are drinking.  

Just need a little support and encouragement. ",5,1728865574.0,stopdrinking,5,1.0,False

1g33onr,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1g33onr/girl_which_indirectly_rejected_me_seems/,"Girl, which indirectly rejected me, seems interested in me now?","Hey, 

2 years ago i saw a girl working as a cashier in a supermarket, in which i reguarly go in. The second time i saw her, i asked her if she would like to have a coffee with me in her break as i was bit crushing towards her. To which, she replied yes after like 5+ seconds. Then it didnt happen, she was working instead of having a break. When nothing was happening, she proposed another day and when i asked her, if she was sure, she said yes. I also gave her my number. Well that day came, when i saw her she looked feeling unwell and she said, its probably not happening today. I felt rejected, considering she didnt message me either. 

Looking back, i have to admit i had as much personality as a slice of bread. Due to multiple reasons, not only was i shy af, but also scared to say something wrong and honestly i was feeling bad/lonely most of the time. I looked handsome back then(even more now, because around that time i also started going to the gym, i get around 3/4 compliments a month) but that was really it. Also since she was like the second girl, i ever asked out cold, i forgot to introduce myself and also feel like i looked desperate, because i waited till nothing was happening to talk to her. I also think even if it went further, it wouldnt have worked out. Looking back i dont like the person i was really. So i get her, but also still feels like a rejection to me.

Fast forward, i changed a lot. No more loneliness, not shy anymore, happy/making progress and worked on everything. I have much more people approach me, even girls asking me for my number after brief talks and seems very easy to get girls to laugh :)

It happened that i saw her again, i started a brief convo and made her laugh a bit. Didnt think anything really. Then when she was done with work another time, we talked a bit more and i was  touchy/introduced myself and we hugged too. Honestly i really liked her humor/charisma here, it was like one of the best convos i had with a girl and was looking forward to talk to her again. Saw her again, she started the convo and said, she was wondering when i would be here (supermarket) again, to which i made a joke that i thought her in a sense of ""i have a free day, while others have to work and you came into my mind"". I guess she meant she thought about, when she would see me again? I made her laugh multiple times, we talked longer because it was pretty quiet. They gonna renew the supermarket and i asked what she will be doing then, and added ""would be good if we see each other more often"", she explained and added ""you can just tell me that you missed me"", to which i said ""i did in the beginning, when i told you i thought about you"" and she laughed(not sure if she thinks i was joking again, i just replied what came into my mind, not sure if she actually meant with this), eventually someone else came and after another laugh, I said have fun working(ironicly), which she replied with a more serious thanks and when i said ""have a nice weekend, see ya"", i didnt hear anything such as a bye etc. Felt like she would rather kept talking with me instead of seeing me leave.

I geniuely feel like it is the best to wait for her to ask me for my number due to how to things went 2 years ago, but because she works there, I feel like she wont and i would like to be 100% sure she is interested. I wouldnt mind a friendship really. Its true that i think a bit more about her after each convo. I would probably joke the next time about her missing me and then see what i do after the reply, but the thing is also, i saw her with another guy before we actually talked again + i dont know how much to push, because i was rejected and would feel awkward in a sense of that i try it now again. 

I would appericiate different perspectives to this.

TL DR : Girl who seemingly rejected me 2 years ago, now starts convos/thought about me, laughs a lot about my jokes and might wanted to know, if i missed her between our last 2 convos.",1,1728865011.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

(My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years and refer to each of our family members as our in laws)

Just for some context, before I ever met my boyfriend’s mother, he informed me about the years of abuse she put him through from birth, up until he moved in with me 3 years ago. When he was a child she was physically abusing and quite literally hospitalised him numerous times. How she got away with it you ask? Only hurting him in ways that could be explained away as “he tripped and hit *insert body part* on the coffee table”.

I met her just over a year ago and it was honestly the most confusing experience I’ve ever had. It was almost hard to picture her doing anything my boyfriend had told me about. She made a few comments on my looks and how she expected me to look… let’s just say she expected the complete opposite and didn’t hold back letting me know.

Here’s what’s been bugging me as of late.

When he was 15 she had another child then two years later had another. She is in her mid 50s with two under 10 year olds and seems to have an issue with the fact that she “has no time to live her life” so constantly guilt trips my partner into baby sitting them. My partner asks me to help him so I go. EVERY. SINGLE. WEEKEND. No exaggeration!! Every weekend for the past 4 months we have been babysitting her children! At first, I could not care less, I was more than happy to baby sit them as they’re very well mannered, lovely young humans. But every weekend? We are early 20s- we no longer have any time to live our lives (as we should be doing) because we are looking after a 50 year old woman’s children so she can go out on the piss.

They went on a trip up the country a few months ago to visit family. My partner went as one of his uncles has recently been put on end of life care. MIL asked me to look after her Great Danes (2) whilst she was away and I accepted as she was guilt tripping us saying she’d have to “lock them in a dark dingey kennel” if I didn’t agree… I looked after them at her house and also stayed there for the 2 weeks they were away. Cut a long story short, the dogs ripped apart my suitcase, ripped some of the clothes from said suitcase into rags, ripped my shoes apart, chewed my HAIRDRYER and basically destroyed everything I bought with me… I told my boyfriend and he told his mum she’d have to replace it all or give me the money to do so. She kicked off saying she wasn’t the one who destroyed my belongings so she will not pay to replace them. (does she want me to bill the twatting dogs or something?) My partner ended up convincing her to send me the money- but it did not end there! Once they arrived home, she did not contact him for almost a month. She messaged out of nowhere kicking off at him claiming that she “has always been there for him! More than *me* and more than *my family*!! How dare *he* ignore *her*!!” She told him his dad hates him, his family hates him, I hate him and she hates him! I told him that he is not to speak to her until she apologises and he agreed. A month later she messages again asking to see him. He went over and explained to her that she had hurt him and he will not let it go as easy if she ever did/said anything like that again. Then she brushed him off and spoke about what she’s been up to instead…

What wound me up is the fact that she’s been messaging like nothing ever happened! And he’s been messaging back the same! Am I crazy?! She full on screamed that no one’s ever loved him and now he’s forgiven her? No- genuinely am I insane? If my mother EVER said anything like that to me, it would take me a very very very long time to forgive her! 
THE WOMAN MAKES ME CRAZY!!

Edit: the worse part of this all, she acts innocent! She claims he “abandoned” her when SHE was the one who physically and mentally abused the hell out of him. When he calls her out on her bullshit, she goes all puppy eyes and acts dumb…

Yes.... she fought someone in the damn kitchen cause while there's barely any blood or fluids on the bed under, and there damn well should be if that's where she was stabbed, there's evidence of a lot of blood thats someone being the dipshit she is cleaned it up with fucking baby wipes and assorted other shit. We know Nick mentioned Gypsy was using carpet cleaner, and if you look closely at the rug in front of Dee Dee's bed... blood, now how did that get there if she was stabbed on her bed... so blood on the carpet, but barely anything on the bed. So here's my theory we all know she was sick and wasn't out of bed much toward the time it happened. She's in the kitchen and is grabbed from behind and is fighting... someone threatens her to stop fighting and shut up, so she does that and says, ""I'm starting to relax. Please don't hurt me."" Now, this part makes me want to rip that little c#nt's head off. Gypsy said that her mom was screaming and asking for her help while it was happening and never entered at any point... but Gypsy isn't that smart... her claim is she was in the bathroom covering her ears... bullshit. Those posts she posted trying to sound like Nick think about the words she used, ""I SLASHED that fat pig, and r*ped her sweet innocent daughter, her scream was so fucking loud LOL"" Dee Dee wasn't just stabbed, she was *SLASHED* in the back of her neck down to the bone. Now that's an interesting choice of words from innocent possum bitch now in't it? Here comes the next part as to why possum bitch was so eager to jump Nick's bones directly after... she told him to be rough with her, to bite her, to mark his territory... then in a future interview she says it was Nick that initiated it and it was consensual at first but then... he bit her... and she screamed cause that hurt her and told him to stop but he wouldn't. Think about that for a second... ""I'm going to get him to put marks all over me, as evidence that what I'm saying is true."" So we have *SLASHED* and then the second part of that post mentions, ""She SCREAMED so fucking loud LOL."" So I don't believe she was not there watching it, because he mom was probably horrified that her child was having this done to and standing there watching, which is why her mother was pleading with her to help her... and she probably just stood there and watched the show. So then... since there's blood from the kitchen and spots in the hallway on the doorway of Dee Dee's room and all over the carpet in Dee Dee's room, but barely any under her, the bed was practically clean except for where her head was. And as an added bonus, we come to the barney doll. Nick has no idea what they're talking about when they ask him about it. He said it wasn't there when he left the room... so apparently, she went in after and played with her mom's bloody corpse by stuffing the barney doll under her head for no other reason other than she found it amusing, maybe even humorous. Then, she dips her finger in her mom's blood and puts that finishing touch on her mother's corpse... the ""V'"" cause it was Victor, right? Not sweet little Gypsy. Lastly, since she was carried and was a bigger woman, Nick couldn't have carried her alone, and Gypsy wouldn't be strong enough... so there's a missing piece who is hiding from all of this... and it's odd that Dan virtually disappeared off of any sort of social media and has been pretty careful since then... and why did he testify for Nick? Guilty... fucking... conscience. And that'd be my best bet as to why Nick knows who Dan is... and said his name when he didn't know he was being filmed... think about that... Why would Nick mention a man Gypsy was actively fucking at some point, if Nick is supposed to be her boyfriend... he certainly seemed upset at Dan going as far as mumbling that Gypsy didn't want him she wanted Dan, and that he knew *the two of them* were going to pin it on him. Gypsy also tried to tell Nick she was going to meet someone for coffee at a cupcake place after the deed was done, and then she'd come back and go with him to his house. Nick, being protective of her, said she wasn't going by herself and that he was going to be in the general area to make sure he doesn't try anything... so that fucked up her plan a bit cause she wasn't going to come back. Then she mailed the murder weapon to Nick's house, complete with the gloves that had Nick's blood on them from where he cut his finger... the knife, yeah, okay, but why the gloves also, because she'd thrown out the blood-soaked baby wipes... so why keep blood-soaked disposable gloves instead of throwing those out as well? Then she got tired of being at Nick's house, so she posted from his computer those sociopathic posts so that people would find her masterpiece... and she'd be ""rescued"" showing signs of bruising and a bite mark she also didn't buy a bus ticket to Nick's for herself, just Nick. She didn't take the majority of her mom's money she only took a little and left the rest that's not in her nature to not be greedy and leave a large amount of money behind. She googled how to keep a dead body from smelling. She turned down the thermostat, and there were freshly placed dryer sheets and baby powder under Dee Dee's mattress... if Dee Dee was stabbed on her bed how the fuck did that get there? I also don't think she invited Nick to that movie theater to meet her mother. She was establishing evidence that he came all the way out there as he was just obsessed. Because Nick said Dee Dee was nice to him, and a neighbor said Dee Dee mentioned Gypsy had a little boyfriend, and she thought that was cute. Then you've got Gypsy saying Dee Dee thought he was creepy for being alone at a kid's movie and told her she wasn't allowed to be with Nick... which would be evidence that Nick wasn't gonna let her mom stop him from being with her... so he showed up unannounced, killed her mom after locking her in the bathroom, SA'd her, then took her to his house against her will... Endgame, she gets the house, all the money, and as much creepy old guy dick as she can fit up her ass. And seeing as how that plan for her to ditch, Nick didn't go as planned... it's entirely possible that because she was arrested, Dan virtually vanished from any social media. That's just a theory, though, but that's how profilers do their job. Sometimes, you have to think like a psycho to catch one.",5,1728864580.0,GRBsnark,1,1.0,False

I’m passing gas without being aware it’s happening. There’s no sound or even physical feeling. It smells terrible and usually happens within minutes of eating, or when I’m anxious then it’ll happen continuously. I wouldn’t believe it’s me if I wasn’t the common denominator everywhere I go… 

I’m so confused why this is happening and my GI doctor doesn’t know either so I’m wondering if anyone has any ideas. Tried googling and can’t even find others with similar symptoms :/

Any one have ANY ideas ?? Please I can’t even socialize anymore bc of this and it’s making me depressed

So he messages me first. He was attractive but his profile only had 1 photo so I thought he was a fake profile. Turns out he was real. We exchanged snapchats. Turns out he's real. But before we even met, he sent like 14 nudes. With face and cock in the same picture. Three videos and 11 nude photos. Over snapchat he makes a joke about him being 6'4 and German and how.shouldn't be surprised. I tell him everyone in my family is over 6 feet and I'm used to German people. Then he says ""Well you're a short guy with a big thing in your pants so that makes up for it.""

Afterward we met for ice cream and coffee downtown. He's new to the area, so he wanted me to show him around downtown. So we walked and talked. He said ""you look really cute and innocent"". I said ""Really?"" and he said ""Yeah. Compared to your Grindr profile and how you look in person. Really cute and innocent."" He said this three different times.

Now, in his profile it said ""Looking for (b)bc"". Normally, that's a huge reflag. But he seemed normal and didn't really say anything racist. But I still figured ask him about it. So I ask if it's a racial fetish. he tries to explain it away. Saying ""Well, I see it as more of, you want what you don't have. Growing up in Germany we don't have a lot of that."" 'Cause I tried to explain the racial dynamics among gay guys in America. And even he acknowledged that someones race/skin color can really determine certain things for the in America. So I did try and explain how that can come off as a racial fetish. But he did say he likes ""really fit non-white guys"". he said he went and put a star by the profile of all the fit black guys in the area.

So we seem to hit off (so I thought). He walked me back to where I parked. We both like cars, so we talked about his car (which is a nice Audi) and how we'd have sex in my car. My car is not piece of Junk. It's a 2019 Chevy, and looks very nice. It's just not an Audi. But he asks if I wanna workout with him tomorrow and then afterward we'd go downtown to fool around at a parking garage I know. So I agree. That night, he asks me to go to a nearby city with him one weekend because he wants to explore and fool around in the hotel room. Now this is after we met for one date. We also exchanged Phone #'s, IG's, Snapchat's and he added mean WhatsApp. So, like, 4 different platforms. He also talked about how I'm one of the few normal guys in the area.

We meet up to workout at his gym. Now at first he offers to pick me up from my house. I just tell him I'll meet him at the gym (my brother used to work there so I know where it is). I spot him while he benches 215. He spots me while Bench 215. It was a good workout. He spots I'm wearing a jockstrap under my shorts. He literally just went blank for a few seconds. lol. So, we get to fooling around downtown in his car. And at first, he starts going on and on about how it's top trim. It's a nice car, so I listened. So we kiss, a lot. I normally don't kiss. But I notice he doesn't do any tongue, which I'm ok with. We traded blowjobs. I found my dick was bigger than his.

Now, he didn't really seem to have any particle turn ons or kinks. I asked him ""What are you into? What do you wanna do?"" He'd answer ""Whatever you wanna do."" So we kissed. Traded blowjobs. I asked if I could cum in his mouth, he was all for it. I blasted in his mouth, and he swallowed. Now that was hot. He saids my cum tasted neutral, so I guess that's good. I sucked him off. Was the first time I gave head. He seemed to enjoy it though. But we didn't do anal. He said his stomach didn't feel good.

Now whenever I paid him a couple compliments, I noticed he wouldn't really say anything. Like he wouldn't acknowledge it really, or barely would. I told him he had pretty eyes (which I genuinely thought he did). He just kinda looked at me and didn't say anything. No ""thank you"". No ""Ya really think so?"" I did tell him he had very kissable lips he said ""I've never been told that before."" I said ""Yeah. You got nice teeth, kissable lips. It's a pretty mouth."" He just looked at me. But the whole time he has a small smile on his face. Now mind you, we're both nude with his hand on my dick, so that should give some context to the scene. lol. He did cum first, and was still happy to please, or so he seemed.

I also noticed he would just look at me during. Like, he's playing with my nipples and just looking at me, or jacking me off and just looking at me. Which felt slightly awkward if it's just him playing around down there and looking at me. Which is why I paid him a compliment. To break up the silence, but also voice a thought I had been thinking. I thought maybe he'd be polite and pay a compliment back. But nah, just like throwing it at a wall. But whenever I kissed him he was 100% there.

I also noticed he never actually complimented me on my face. Or much of my body either. Besides saying I look ""cute and innocent with my glasses on."" Like, he wouldn't really say anything about my body. Even when we were naked. No ""Damn you're hot"" or ""Your ass is so nice"" or ""That's a big dick."" None of that. Whenever it was brought up I had to bring up. Is that odd? That, combined with the maintained eye contact.

Now I went on Grindr a few minutes ago and noticed he blocked me. I haven't messaged him much today. Just a couple good morning messages on snapchat (where he told me last night it was best to reach him). But he hasn't responded. Which is ok 'cause I've had a busy day today. Now as far a body's go, mine has more developed muscles than his. He's very much in shape, but I've had people tell me I could do body-building.

But I'm just now having a moment to sit and process all this. Is all this subtext stuff normal? I feel kinda used. Like, not paying back compliments, the blocking, etc. Am I just overthinking stuff.

I do wanna say, I've got a pretty big following on social media, which I was reluctant to tell him about. I don't really like to bring it up when meeting guys. But he did follow me on Insta. I didn't really follow him back (Hey, I sent spicy pics and gave the guy my snapchat, my phone #, and my WhatsApp. And we only met 2 days ago).

  
Update: Today we exchanged a few good morning snapchats. Nothing spicy or heavy. I have noticed the frequency in messaging has gone down since we last met. ",1,1728864426.0,askgaybros,1,1.0,False

Long version: 

I’m passing gas without being aware it’s happening. There’s no sound or even physical feeling. It smells terrible and usually happens within minutes of eating, or when I’m anxious then it’ll happen continuously. I wouldn’t believe it’s me if I wasn’t the common denominator everywhere I go… 

I’m so confused why this is happening and my GI doctor doesn’t know either so I’m wondering if anyone has any ideas. Tried googling and can’t even find others with similar symptoms :/

Any one have ANY ideas ?? Please I can’t even socialize anymore bc of this and it’s making me depressed

When I first taught my students about the Italian *passato remoto*, their eyes widened like deer caught in headlights. ""No equivalent in English?"" they exclaimed. Yet, once they got the hang of it, they realized it's not just for dusty textbooks or old tales. 

Ever sat down with a cup of coffee in Naples or Florence? You might have overheard someone using *passato remoto* to chat about yesterday’s lunch!

**Key insights:**

- *Passato remoto* is used to narrate **completed actions** in the **distant past**, whether it’s about Romans founding Rome in 753 BC, or my uncle’s recounting of how he ""found"" a fantastic café just the other day.
- It shines in **historical narration** and **literature**. Think about Dante who *scrisse* or Michelangelo who *nacque*. This tense holds the weight of ages.

**Irregularities and quirks:**
- Some verbs, like *essere*, are completely irregular – much like life, unpredictable!
- Yet, these quirks make storytelling in Italian richer and more vibrant.

Not just for textbooks, *passato remoto* is your ticket to chatting with locals and diving into the culture. What's your favorite Italian tale or historical snippet you’d use this tense for? Share below!",1,1728864314.0,thinkinitalian,0,1.0,False

I go to the bathroom 3-4 times a day and it's almost guaranteed always after I eat a meal. Sometimes it's just regular (not diarrhea or anything) but sometimes it can be a little runnier than usual. Regardless, I know it's coming after I drink coffee or eat a regular meal - almost always. The other thing is that it takes me a LONG time to go on occasions. This can be very embarrassing if I'm at a restaurant with someone and I disappear for 25 minutes. Once I get going it's like I'm in pain until I finish all the way. And sometimes even when I think I'm finished (and wipe as much as I possibly can), I'll start to feel things in that area a half hour later and will have to go to the bathroom and wipe again - it's extremely embarrassing. 

  
I have struggled with anxiety from time to time and that definitely makes it worse. I'm not sure if that's 100% the issue.

I (25F, 160cm, CW=185lbs, GW=115lbs) have been trying to lose weight seriously. I started in September at 185lbs and experimented the whole month of September with my workouts where if I went on morning walk (10 kilometers where 3km is uphill) in the morning, I lost weight easily but the rest of the day I had no energy and if I went on afternoon walk on the same path with same diet and even adding some strength workout in the morning, I didn't lose weight. But in September, despite eating almost similar food the whole month, the calories were not under my control as I wasn't cooking some days and when I did cook, I didn't know the calorie of my portion of food. For example, I put 3 table spoon of olive oil in the stir-fry which I ate 40% of, do I put 40% of the total calories of olive oil in the food when I calculate my calorie intake? Or the potatoes? I did put 2 medium sized (may be 70 cals each) potato in the stir-fry, how much of it ended up in my plate, I don't know.

This week I was so busy both physically and mentally that I could not workout at all. I was so busy that if I sat down in a place more than a minute, I was falling asleep. Finally it ended yesterday and this morning I realized I didn't check my weight the whole week and finally checked and I was back to my initial weight. I am so pissed at the situation. I am not angry at myself as I was so busy, but I am so upset looking at my weight.

Another thing is 2 of the closest people of my life have decided to get married some where within mid/late February 2025 to mid March. I NEED to lose weight for that event. I will be meeting them and a lot of people I haven't seen for years. The highest they have seen me (in real life or physically) is at is around 135lbs and I haven't met them after gaining weight. I am too embarrassed to meet all of them at this weight.

I only have 4 months till then. I need to lose as much weight as possible. I was thinking about doing intermittent fasting (it works for me) and low carb for these 4 months. But as I have noticed, I don't lose weight when I go on long walks in the afternoon/evening despite this being the best time for me and lose weight if I go for walks in early morning (despite it not being suitable for my life in general), I am really stressed.

For diet, I was thinking I will eat whatever my family eats but in smaller portion for 1 meal and for another meal, I will just have 2 boiled eggs and an apple and a glass of milk. And for lunch, i'll have coffee. This was sustainable for a month in September. But for 4 whole months, I don't know if it will work.

I need all the advice I can get and apply in my daily life to lose weight. I can't be at this weight in the wedding. I will be the center of attention if people suddenly see me at this weight (I didn't gain much weight in the face because of that people haven't noticed much). I am really stressed, I don't want people going 'what happened' 'why are you so fat now' and giving me weight loss advice that day. People are really blunt here, especially about weight and it seems like the first thing everyone says to me is ""You have gained so much weight"" for the past couple years since covid.",2,1728863705.0,PetiteFitness,2,0.75,False

I went to the ER where they found 1 DVT, and Bilateral Pulmonary Embolism. A dose of Lovinox, then immediately started me on Eliquis. Admitted for four days, while being assisted with pain management. Pain largely subsided and became very tolerable. Doctors think it's provoked as I had injured my calf, and went on strict bed rest for nearly three weeks. Sent home to begin out patient care.

Had blood in my flem. Back to the ER two days later. This is when they found the second DVT in the same leg. The doctors were concerned as I was on Eliquis and still in the double dosing phase. They did however remark that my lungs had a surprising amount of improvement in such a short time between the CT scans.

Another five days in the hospital. This time on a heparin drip. Of those 5 days I think I only spent 36 hours actually therapeutic. They had to keep upping my dose, and giving me a bolis. Started at 1800 units. Ended on 2400, but was only on that for like an hour before the doctor stopped it, did another shot of Lovinox, and then back to the Eliquis for discharge. The blood in my flem was lessening and now is gone. Although I do have the coffee ground looking flecks in my flem. I'll be discussing that with my doctor on Friday. 

My real question is about the second DVT they found. The doctors speculated that it was potentially missed in the first ultrasound, and didn't actually form in the 6 days between the ultrasounds. The improvement in my lungs had them feeling like the Eliquis is effective, and it's unlikely I clotted more while on it.

I'll be getting ultrasounded again Friday, much sooner than they usually check in on clots, but they want to confirm no more form rather than really check in on the progress of the 2 I already have.

I know my situation is quite specific, but my anxiety is pretty high. A common theme for us I found out when I found this sub. Has anyone else had clots that were deemed to be ""missed,"" as opposed to newly formed while on thinners?",1,1728863669.0,ClotSurvivors,0,1.0,False

*If you don’t have anything nice to say, you must be my daughter-in-law,* and what else would Kate expect with her relentless salvo of, “I want my son back.”  Her verbal provocation ignited a firestorm of a tussle with Tennie while a shell-shocked audience watched as Kate, looking like an insect assuming the dying pose of lying on its back with its legs sticking up in the air, tried to scissor her legs into a rocking motion to right herself, only succeeding in having her son fall on her like a weighted throw blanket while both she and Tennie sputtered, “You bitch; you stupid bitch.”  Production stepped in, allowing Kate to consider herself the victor much as Thomas Dewey thought he had the 1948 presidency in the bag over Harry S Truman.  She stalked off, “You can have her; you can have her forever,” she huffed.  “Why” queried Rob.  Tennie responded, “You can blame me; I don’t care.  Your momma got an attitude.  For what”?  “Chill out,” implored Rob, but Tennie was hot, “Get outta’ my face.  In 17 years, she never came to see you; I was there,” while simultaneously in the elevator, Kate crackled, “If my son would leave that dusty-ass bitch, he’d be able to make it,” the glue descending from her fake lashes like granulated snow on cracked stone.  “I’m sick of that fat-ass ho got my son . . .them damn kids. . . bitch . . . you make me feel some kind of way and when you leave my son, I’m, gonna’ beat you up again.”  *Every bunny was kung-foo fighting.*  “Gremlin robbin’ ho,” she added for good measure.  Cheyenne, the dutiful daughter alarmed by this unseen side of her mother cried, “Momma, calm down,” as Tennie said, “I can’t breathe.  If you don’t have something positive to say, why you here”?  Nehemiah admits, “I never really seen my mom fight somebody like that,” Cheyenne adds, “My heart dropped to my stomach.  Everything in my head really just stopped.”  As Kate wends her way toward the parking lot and her raspberry-colored car, she avows, “That bitch, you don’t have to worry about me no more.”  Poor Rob, dewy with sweat and panting heeds Tennie’s declaration, “I don’t know what that’s going to do to our relationship, but . . . my makeup look cute; my hair look cute, and here comes you!  Miserable.  Shake your son’s life up all you want; you done it all this time, but you can leave me fucking alone.”  Rob, disconsolate and dejected mourns, “It was supposed to be a celebration about me, but it didn’t . . . like I’m this cord they’re both pulling.  How do you fix this”? 

At home, after this transformative day, the takeaway for her is, “I can’t believe how the day went. . . I lost two of my nails,” and for him, “I broke my chain.”  Well, it is Tennie’s time of the month; she’s tired and has suffered anxiety attacks since her father died when she was 4 years old.  “To be honest, I feel like the issue was between Kate and anyone she came in contact with.  Today, just so happened to be me and my family.  I wanted to love her, but that’ll never happen now.  She was his pre-jail, but they had their differences, and now their communication is off.  This complicates things and what hurts him the most is his welcome home party and bringing everyone together.”  Rob voices, “I don’t know how to look at you right now as far as getting in her face.”  “I didn’t get in your mom’s face first, "" Tennie fires back.  “When you turned around,” . . .but he’s cut off, “It’s your mom’s constant negative energy.  I encourage you to work on your relationship with her, but I’m washing my hands.”   The kids won’t though entirely.  Nehemiah grants that people make mistakes and he’s willing to forgive.  He’ll still view her as grandma.  Cheyenne will look at Kate differently because that dustup was childish and unloving; so much so that she doesn’t know if she wants to pursue a further relationship with her.  Rob is lost for words; he feels that he must somehow deserve that paltry welcome-home party.  “No,” says Tennie.  “Nobody showed up.  How do I take that”?  A BAD DAY.  Yes Rob, but how many of us have days we don’t deserve?  He brings up an interesting point - “Do you love me or do you love what I can be for you”?  Can love remain true when loving acts decrease or change?  Thinking one is loved is not the same as feeling loved.  Kate wants her son to raise her now as she did him, and Tennie, as a technical stay-at-home mother, would like Rob’s contribution to be more than the bupkis he makes as a safety inspector for semi-trucks, et al.  *What should you do if you miss your mother-in-law?  Reload the gun and try again.*

**I Have To Talk My Ovaries Down Like A Hostage Negotiator**

Bianca still wants her coffee and following in the footsteps of her predecessors, she becomes resentful.  “I feel like Daniel owes me something.  He’d be wearing prison blues if not for me.  I’ve done a lot.”  “What,” fires back Daniel automatically, “does that look like to you”?  “You just haven’t been able to *pause* provide me with anything beside” . . .. She’s interrupted, “It’s my first day out.  Can you give me a chance”?  “No,” she shakes her head impatiently, “but I mean that’s what I’m saying.  I was trying to give you a chance.”  “Well, I made breakfast,” and so endeth that convo.  They must go to the parole officer to see if Daniel can stay in the apartment instead of the dicey halfway house whose residents have the freedom and wiles to get themselves remanded.  Bianca isn’t allowed in at the interview; her waiting in the car is her leap of faith.  She wants to meet the P.O. and when she finally does, the news is good for he will send a case transfer note to Scottsdale.  An officer will come around in the following month to conduct an investigation, and if the temperature is temperate, Bianca can focus on her baby fever, accelerated by having lost one during a prior relationship.  They didn’t use protection, and Daniel came twice last night and it made her positively giddy, “It was an oops.”  She’s in the name-planning stage while Daniel is trying to convince her of the irresponsibility of pregnancy when he is in straightened financial waters what with his fines and child support for a 13-year-old son he’s never seen, having been barred from doing so, with whom he predictably wants a relationship.  If it doesn’t work out, he has Bianca – she’s the emotional equivalent of a pre-teen who grins at the green light of her own ideas and purses her lips at the stop signs.  Well, they have a vague Plan B.  Would that be like hide-and-seek?  Ready or not, here I come.  *Doctor*:  *What kind of birth control are you using?  Me: Just my personality.*

**“I Pity The Fool”**

“How is it that the system is set up like this,” Britney queries.  “We shouldn’t even be in this situation,” she reasons without accounting for personal responsibility.  Permissions?  *We don’t need no stinking permissions.*  “We literally did everything they asked us to.  This is sick.  Sometimes I feel like the entire world is against me,” rails Kerok while Britney tries to comfort him by lying, “It’s not your fault.”  She’s busy checking for bedbugs in that sumptuous government hotel room reminiscent of a jail cell while Kerok finds skid marks on the buttery breathable organic cotton sheets that get softer with every wash.  Britney is re-living her PTSD from when she was homeless at 16 years old while Kerok, who still doesn’t fully get it, vainly makes phone calls to the Texas property manager to get his deposit and first month's rent back – they’ve been holding the unit off the market so no, no refunds.  Worse to come is Tammy, Kerok’s mom, who “is great but she’s got an edge to her,”  - like a Gillette razor blade, who, with boyfriend Ocean by her side, who resembles a mountain, is on tippytoes with excitement to start over, tired from packing, and ready to withstand a long drive.  And after rubbing her hands together gleefully and saying, “Time to go,” she’s reduced to exclaiming, “Are you fucking kidding me?  Oh, hell no!  Y’all playing, right”?  Kerok explains, “We was taking a leap of faith, but jumped in too soon.”  “This is really fucking bullshit.” Tammy flounces off to the car; she’s going to Texas goddammit, with or without.  “I’m done with y’all.”  *Dis Tew Much.*

**“You’re Sure No One Else Is Fucking Better”?**

Eighteen months out in the Atlantic dunes at 30° F for a polar plunge and that is somehow supposed to cement Melissa’s commitment or sanity.  “Life has been great; I finally have Louie to myself.”  He’s still working at a pizzeria because while he’s personable at his job interviews, his background checks are killers, so he’s been reduced to being a jack-of-no-trades selling nutritional supplements, healthy smoothies, and doing personal training.  Her nose still looks fleshy at the base and Louie’s arm looks like a Seurat pointillist maze of a landscape, but as they strip off their layers of clothing, they are supposed to be stripping away old layers of past bad relationships.  Melissa was locked out of a house she thought was hers and had been disappointed so many times that she believed, “As soon as I give up control, something catastrophic will happen.”  They intend to immerse themselves in the ocean - a symbolic baptism faintly reminiscent of the Sirens – those singing goddesses of artistic inspiration in *O Brother Where Art Thou?* serving as a cautionary myth of the consequences of those who challenge the divine order; however, they barely make it to the waist, and that reasons Melissa is why she deserves a ring.  She’s been pushing to schedule the natural progression of engagement and marriage, but Louie is more free-wheeling and wants things to spin out biologically like photosynthesis, as well as needing time to save money for that specific 2-carat diamond ring without going into debt.  He’s got a stash that has taken him 1 ½ years to accumulate that’s secret.  He’s only ever had one pre-prison 3K account because he’s used to spending all his money on drugs, but now, he’s learning to save money responsibly and build up his credit.  When he tells his mother, Donna, that veritable Italian matriarch he’s going ring shopping, she inimitably asks, “Why”?  Confronted with the hard truth of gaining a daughter-in-law, she sighs, “I guess I don’t have a choice, and I guess I will learn about her the hard way.  It’s not peaches-and-cream, that’s for damn sure!”   “Is anything,”? asks Louie.  “No.”  Donna’s been married 3 times and the third wasn’t a charm, so she reminds her son, “Sometimes things just don’t last forever so don’t be stupid.”  *Marriage is simple.  Your wife does whatever she wants, and you do whatever she wants.*

**Have Kids They Said, It Will Be Fun They Said**

Life, more specifically death and its attendant paperwork is raining on their parade.  Getting your tubes tied is ok for Justine; she’s already there (whatever that means), but a vasectomy for Michael is unacceptable.  “It’s like getting your eyebrows done,” argues Justine.  “How many vasectomies have you had to know,” rebuts Michael.  He doesn’t like playing God, but he already is a creator and sustainer of his burgeoning universe which is rather godlike.  He’s also a fatalist, “If I’m supposed to have a kid at 75, I’ll have a kid at 75.”  Does he think he’s DeNiro or Pacino?  “I don’t want someone to go in there and God forbid, do something they’re not supposed to do, and I’m stuck with some shit that doesn’t work.”  Justine says, “I think that’s being extreme.”  “You don’t even know about tying your own tubes.  What if I’m the first one that goes wrong”?  And hitting the unreturnable ball over the net, Justine asserts, “Wouldn’t it be better, were that to happen, to save my life if it was at stake?  If the tables were turned, I wouldn’t hesitate to sacrifice a limb.”  But Millz is unmoved, “If you wanna’ be mad, be mad.”  “What do you care if I’m mad; you don’t give a shit.  It’s not like you’re cutting your balls off.”  “That’s what it feels like.  You’re supposed to be Team Me, but right now, I’m not actual Team You.  I’m Team My Balls,” huffs Michael.  “How many kids do you have,”? insists Justine, “You’ve reaped the maximum benefits of your . . . “  As if to illustrate how the tempers of such a large blended family are like a game of Russian Roulette, high-functioning autistic Santannah, Justine’s son, calls frantically for mom to come home.  She arrives with Michael to mediate the alleged bullying by Michael Jr., who trashed and threw a $1500 iPhone in the closet because of a dare and said his dad was better than stepbro’s mom.  Montana punches the air in frustration.  Just wait until Manhattan grows into his own borough.  *You mean there are other ways you could have taken my temperature?*

Last time was last year’s Primary Program, but at that point it had only been a few months since I stopped attending with my tbm husband altogether so while it was hard then, I guess it wasn’t as jarring. 

Guys, it sucked. Everything about it sucked. The opening hymn was Hope of Israel, which has some really fun violent lyrics. I couldn’t make myself sing it. Both sets of grandparents were there. My in laws never bothered with coming to the Primary Program until I left the church. They’re…fun. All eyes on me as I quietly passed the tray on. Lots of fake people pretending to be happy to see me before I could escape after the program. I know people mean well, but it’s so transparent and icky. If you wanted to see me outside of church you would, I literally live three doors down. I don’t care that we’re not friends, just don’t be fake with me. 

My 6yo left with me, and I drove to the local coffee shop and proceeded to break down in the drive thru. There were no cars behind me, and owner took one look at me told me to pull forward and get out so she could hug me. We talked for a few minutes and I calmed down before another car pulled up and then I took my drink and went home. 

I don’t know how to explain it to my husband if my 6yo tells him about it. He won’t understand. I feel like everyone pities him when they look at our situation; the pious husband with the shitty, deviant wife. No one around me cares how I feel. They’d say I deserve to feel bad and should come back to church to feel better. If only that would actually work.

Yesterday afternoon my daughter and I shared a cookie big as a saucer with iced coffee. Then I decided to go out and walk. Went to Paseo, my usual route. Then in a snap, I felt dizzy, disoriented and exhausted. Thinking it was dehydration since I was sweating alot I was determined to finish despite the exhaustion, I paced myself and pushed till I finished .

When I got home, I was still feeling weak and tired then I asked my son to check my blood sugar, confirmed my suspicion, level was so high. Took warm lemon water and waited it out. Took 2 hours till I felt normal.

I was complacent and risked myself over a cookie. Have to be careful and vigilant if I want D gone from my life. Got to weigh the good and the bad all the time and mostly the bad wins😂. More sweat to expel, got to run. Thanks.",6,1728863271.0,cagayandeoro,7,1.0,False

I'm 32 years old. I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis at 11; Crohn's at 29.  
  
At 25 I had a proctocolectomy and an ileo-anal anastomisis reservoir a.k.a, a J-pouch. Things seemed okay 'til 2019 when I became anemic. I tried conservative management but oral iron wasn't helping so I was referred to a hematologist.  
  
I've had 107 iron infusions since 2020. I've tried about 7 different iron formulas and trying another new one along with nettle leaf tea, but I doubt it's going to help. I've been diagnosed with malabsorption by 3 doctors.  
  
I developed rectovaginal fistula; a fistula from one bowel loop into another, and maybe other fistulas, but they weren't located on scan. I had gas coming through vaginally, and I was worried that the uterus was compromised. I tried Remicaid when I was a kid but that: failed; I tried Humira 2021-2023: failed. I've been on Entyvio and can't say I'm better off.   
  
I had a pouchoscopy in June and it looked good; there were two spots of ulceration but nothing that would warrant such large amounts of blood loss (plus I don't see bright red blood or coffee ground like passings) I had an upper endoscopy done and got an A+. Nothing to speak of there.  
  
So after 5 years, and 107 iron infusions I've got about 4 doctors: my family doctor; gastroenterologist; colorectal surgeon; and hematologist now telling me that this must be gynecological. It didn't seem like I had heavy periods but my surgeon said they may be heavy for me. To note: after an iron infusion my next period is exceptionally heavy with clots and sheet-like passings of blood. This last one, I had some serious pain, pain I've never had before, but I had COVID at the same time so not sure if that added insult to injury. The severity of bleeding decreases as my ferritin levels fall. So by time I'm anemic again my periods are light to normal and I have very little pain and cramping. But by that time I get another round of iron infusions I'm heavy (up to 8 days of bleeding) and the next month down to 6 days then the next down to 4-5 and boom anemic again. And so the cycle goes. It's like my body is using the uterus to throw away all my iron.   
  
I lost my job because of anemia and with so many appointments, infusions, and then developed rectovaginal fistulas. I got approved for disability. This is has literally disabled me.  
  
So, now I'm see this new gynecologist Wednesday. Actually I'm seeing the gatekeeper, the Physicians Assistant, which feels defeating. I have avoided one for a while now because I just wanted to deal with my GI issues and didn't want to deal with more than I could cope with but now that I've been through the ringer, and the GI is no longer the murder suspect, I'm going.  
  
I don't want birth control or IUDs; I have adverse reactions and it upsets the Crohns. I don't want to deal with tranexamic acid because of GI upset yet again, with headaches and it just prolongs periods. I know they have to diagnose my condition, rule out cancer, fibroids, endometriosis etc. but given bad side effects for medications and my personal aversion to more medication therapy (I'm just tired of pills infusions and being medication dependent; I'm angry and bitter and just feel like an exploited costumer to the pharmaceutical companies) what is the probability of getting surgery? Would the doctor even be agreeable to a hysterectomy or will I have to continue to suffer?  
  
(I'm not married; not in a relationship; not looking for a man and not going to have kids. I feel so medically raped by this system. I've had to undress and be examined so many times as kid. I remember when I'd cry just from abdominal pressings the nurse practitioners would be mean to me and ask why I was crying does it hurt or are you just scared. Zero compassion. I feel like I've never had autonomy over my body; never had a choice. I forced to being examined because it had to be done, but it went against every moral fiber in my body as a child and it's affected my so bad that I will never undress for a man. I will never give anyone access to my body; I only do it now because I have to. And I'm sick of it.  
  
I'm not actually afraid of surgery in fact if it relieved my problems physically and emotionally, I'm completely on board, but I have a J-pouch which throws a wild card into the whole thing.  
  
I've researched ablation and because I have the history of fistulas I don't want to do it. I'm also worried about a uterine ablation failing being I'm younger. If the lining grows back then I'm back to square one; I'm back to feeling raped with more examinations and more procedures. I don't want to have to go through more test/procedures and then just wind up with surgery in the end anyway) I just want this all to end and have my life back. I want a hysterectomy. 

I know the surgical risks, but I don't care. I'm not scared; complications are low. I'll do it. I've been through one major surgery and everything went fine. I want this anemia over with and I want to make a choice for once.  
  
I have yet to see the gynecologist but from others experiences what questions should I maybe ask; what should I say? I don't want to be a red flag and aborted from the practice. Especially since I've never been treated by this office before. (My past records are too old and destroyed by now. I forsook going to the gynecologist because it was my way of asserting control) I've been mistreated enough by doctors; the one gastroenterologist let me go because I was too complicated and just ghosted me. Referred me to a place 1 1/2 hours a away (and I can't drive) and then wouldn't return calls or anything when I said I can't drive and that isn't feasible for me.  
  
I'm heartbroken; I think I can say I'm traumatized; I'm at my wits end and if I can't stop the anemia, I want to die. I'm giving up. I don't love life anymore. In my mind it's an ultimatum: hysterectomy or death. I'm not continuing. I'm not doing medication anymore; I'm not getting shoved pillar to post from one doctor to another. The iron infusions are getting harder and harder. If this appointment goes belly up, I'm stopping my iron infusions. I almost died of anemia once (my hemoglobin was a 5) I know what it feels like. It's not a horrible way to go. The migraine is the worst part.  
  
I'm so so sad. I'm going to post results from past radiology reports. If you have nothing to say, just send me a virtual hug.

The moving trucks were outside bringing down the last of the boxes so that we could move to that new fancy apartment on the upper west side. That's when I found it.

The cassette case said **TDK**. Inside the case was card stock that read, in laundry pen graffiti, ""Mr. Magic Rap Attack '84"". It was under some old copies of the NY Post from October 1984.

I paid it no mind as I hated doing fucking chores. My parents on the other hand thought chores were good for the soul. And while I vehemently disagreed, I knew enough to choose my battles. Especially if I wanted to go study abroad next term.

I intended to toss the cassette into one of the Hefty bags of garbage I had been tasked with filling. The attic was just about empty and this was the last box of shit that needed to be sorted through.

I tossed the cassette case over my shoulder expecting it to land in the bag. It did not.

""What's this?"" I heard my dad ask. I didn't even hear him come up in the attic.

I shrugged. I think I'm almost done, Dad.

Dad looked down at the tape. His eyes got wider. I heard him say, almost inaudibly, ""No fucking way.""

After that things started getting really strange.

By the time we were settled into the new digs overlooking Central Park Dad barely left his home office. He started taking his meals and sleeping in there.

Then the arguments with Mom started. It got so bad one night Mom came in my room in tears, crying hysterically. I tried to comfort her and said, ""What is it?""

""Your father said, 'I was, erm, *wack*.'""

This wasn't *like* Dad.

Dad adored and worshipped the ground my mother walked on. But the only way to avoid his wrath now was to steer clear of his home office. Being a teen, I tried to focus on the fun things in life. Women, comic books, vaping my weed pen.

If Dad and Mom were having problems, I didn't want to get involved. They were always giving me chores and disciplining me and wanted to go through my phone. Maybe a little aggravation for Mom might let her walk a mile in my shoes. All happy families are alike.

A week ago, things got really weird. Mom came in my room after midnight and slept on the floor next to my bed. From the long hallways outside my bedroom, I could hear Dad rapping.

It sounded like:

*Step, step, step, step, step off*

*Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh*

Dad was working a new high profile, high paying job.

It was his first really good job and we all had been excited.

Dad's boss, Michelangelo, had taken Dad with him to a new startup. My Dad was what is called a ""subject matter expert"" on some proprietary process that apparently was suddenly worth big bucks. Michelangelo was looking to cash in and he was taking Dad along for the ride.

And then, then something went wrong.

""Can you put your father on the phone, Jack?"" Michelangelo asked in his thick Argentinian accent.

My mother asked who it was. I told her.

""Jack? Jack?! I need to talk to your dad! It's very important!""

""But he told me not to disturb him under any circumstances,"" I said.

Mom stood next to me looking concerned. I handed her the phone.

Mom did a lot of *uh-huhing* and *okaying.*

The call ended and Mom said, ""I need you to go in your father's office now and tell him he needs to go to the office.""

I gave Mom a puzzled look. Her face had a pinched look.

""Go, Jack. Tell him.""

Outside Dad's office door I hesitated. The sign on the door read:

***This room protected by the hounds of hell three days a week.***

***You guess which ones.***

I knocked.

Nothing. Just a faint thumping I could feel in my body.

I knocked again. Same result.

I put my hand on the knob and caught a static electric shock that made a spark. This was showing every sign of not working out well for me.

And then I took a deep breath, turned the knob and pushed.

That when I was assaulted by two things.

Things I was assaulted by:

1. Bass in my face.
2. Dad's hand
3. Pungent marijuana smoke

Dad pulled me in and slammed the door.

He was wearing a black silk robe, tidy whities, a red Kangol hat. I looked down at Dad's feet. He was sockless in a pair of red and white Air Jordans. Dad held me by the arm hard.

""You got the shit, home slice?"" Dad asked me.

""The shit?"" I asked.

""Oh, you lookin' to beef, son? You lookin' to beef?""

I shrugged. From a big boom box in the corner I heard some obnoxious voice say, ""Yo! Lemme speak to Cookie Puss, yo!""

""Dad. Michelangelo called. They really need you to go to the office.""

Dad looked at me carefully.

""You frontin'?""

""No, Dad. Michelangelo called and sa-""

Dad threw me up against the wall. He put his finger in my face. He looked possessed.

""Aiiight. Michelangelo wanna see me? We gonna step to him, son. Go get your Kangol, homes.""

Twenty minutes later Dad and I were in a taxi on the way to the office.

""We could have taken an uber, Dad.""

Dad took a pack of Newport cigarettes out of his denim jacket and lit one with a Bic.

""What the fuck is an uber?"" Dad asked annoyed.

The taxi driver looked in the rearview mirror at Dad and said, ""No smoking, please, sir.""

""I ain't fucking smoking, Yo. I'm keeping the fire from spreading.""

Twenty minutes later Dad and I were in Michelangelo's office.

""Jay! We got to get the process to Asia by Monday. The whole board is watching. This is showtime and I can't get in touch with you? What's going on?""

Dad lit another cigarette.

Michelangelo asked, ""Maybe Jack can wait outside and, Jesus Jay, no smoking!""

Dad let the smoke out his nostrils in two steady streams.

Then he looked at me and winked.

""Son. Forget all that shit I told you. That shit about duty, loyalty, commitment, climbing the ladder. Here hold my smoke,"" he said and handed me a half smoked cigarette.

""Okay, Jay! I don't know what's gotten into you but-""

Dad swaggered over behind Michelangelo's big desk. Michelangelo rolled his chair back a bit, ""What are you doi-""

And that's when Dad grabbed Michelangelo by his suit lapels.

He pulled Michelangelo's face real close to his.

""Don't push me, cause I'm close to the edge. I'm trying not to lose my head,"" Dad hissed.

And that's when Joey Martinez came in. Joey was not Dad's favorite person. He was Michelangelo's though. And Joey was always giving Dad shit. Dad used to never shut up about it at dinner. But Michelangelo brought the two of them to the new startup.

""Jay! What you doing?!?!?!""

Michelangelo squirmed and Dad lifted him up then dropped him on his desk, never letting go of his lapels. Joey ran over to separate them. I sat frozen in the leather guest chair.

Joey kept trying to pull Dad off Michelangelo which just made Dad angry. He started slamming Michelangelo on the desk.

""You slurp your fucking coffee,"" Dad yelled in Michelangelo's face. ""You sound like a little,"" and then Dad called him a bad word.

Michelangelo screamed, ""Joe. Call security and the police.""

Joe ran to the door and that's when Dad took a running start and tackled him.

And then the fluorescent light reflected on something metallic.

The glint reappeared each time Dad raised his hand. Then it was gone as the glint dropped with gravity and gravitas.

""Bad review!?! Needs improvement?!? Your process??""

""Get off me,"" he yelled but it was in vain.

Crimson geysers appeared and Joe began to wail, ""No, please. No, no. I'm not wack. I'm not.""

""But you are. You're a toy boy, son.""

Then Dad stood. He was covered in a deep red that coordinated with his basketball shoes.

Michelangelo picked up his phone and said, ""Hel-"".

Dad head turned 270 degrees. It registered that Michelangelo was phoning for assistance.

Then in the blink of an eye Dad had him up in the air by his throat.

""You gon' drop a dime? Naw, we gon' drop science. And surgery.""

I always thought my dad was a bit of pushover. They way he kissed Mom's ass. They way he kissed Michelangelo's ass. But whatever was happening in that office was not the acts of a pushover.

I suddenly felt the burn. I dropped the cigarette. It had burned to the filter.

Then I saw the glint again under the fluorescent lights.

Michelangelo screamed.

Dad started dancing and dropping the glint in time with an invisible beat.

Then Dad began to rap:

*Everybody go, ""Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn""*

*You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend*

Michelangelo turned his waning gaze to me.

""Jack. Get help.""

Then Dad dragged Michelangelo over the desk. He dropped him on the floor writhing.

""Jack,"" Dad said to me. ""God helps those who help themselves.""

And then Dad put the sharp metal in Michelangelo's hands and gave a push.

Then another.

The rug got red and wet.

I just sat there. Jack just laid there. And in another minute Michelangelo said, ""I was so close. So close.""

And that's when the cops came.

Dad's last words were, ""You'll never take me alive, you wack coppers!""

And he was right.",3,1728862657.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Hey women of Reddit! I'm an early 30's male who thrives on deep conversations, spontaneous adventures, and genuine connections.  Lately, I've been feeling a bit like a lone wolf howling at the moon, and I'm really craving some solid female friendships that I lack in my life.

Here's a little glimpse into my world: 

\* I'm a deep thinker: I once spent an entire afternoon contemplating the existential implications of a misplaced sock. (It was a really nice sock, okay?) 

\* Conversation enthusiast:  I love diving into topics that make you think, make you laugh, and make you question everything you thought you knew. 

\* Adventure seeker:  Whether it's exploring a hidden gem in the city or spontaneously road-tripping to a quirky roadside attraction, I'm always up for something new. 

\* Genuine soul:  What you see is what you get. Emotions on my sleeve and all that. I value authenticity and honesty above all else. This means I can be bashful and occasionally professionally awkward, but at least you won't need to second guess my thoughts or feelings!

\* I'm also HUGE on cozy living, aka hygge, being raised in a Danish-American household. 😊

\* Also, if you like a man who has a tendency to write novel-length messages to you, I'm glad to have finally made your acquaintance! 😎

If you're a woman who: \* Enjoys thought-provoking conversations that go beyond small talk \* Is open to trying new things and stepping outside your comfort zone \* Appreciates genuine connection and vulnerability \* Has a good sense of humor and doesn't take life too seriously (though I do at times so you can too)

...then I'd love to hear from you!  ✨ Let's grab coffee, explore a new hiking trail, or just chat for hours about the mysteries of the universe.

Send me a DM with a fun fact about yourself, and maybe a photo, and let's see if we click! 😊 I can also share one of myself, if you like to put a face to the Redditor. 😄",3,1728862500.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I’m exhausted, aside from the physical exhaustion, I’m mentally drained from the lack of respect my boss gives me and other staff and all the expectations he places on me, but that’s another issue. Outside of work I train for track and run 6 days a week, and gym 2-3 times on my days off when i can too. One of those days is my short day, where I do the open (6am) and used to work until 2pm. I’d then go for a run and meet my partner for dinner. That finish time moved from 2pm, to 2:30, to now 3pm (closing duty shifts finish at 3:30). So my only shorter day has become 30 minutes less than a full open-close shift, and now cuts into my personal time, and for the last few weeks I cannot remember one day where I haven’t finished work and had to rush my training/personal plans, leading to panic attacks and mental breakdowns. I just can’t deal with the pressure anymore, I’m spreading myself so thin in every facet of my life and it’s really affecting my mental health, to the point where I know I have to quit soon, or I’ll end up hurting myself. My shifts are 8-9 hours long on my feet the entire time, I only get a 15 minute lunch break (which is illegal where I’m from), I get home, have maybe 15 minutes to shower get changed, before I have to rush out the house and do a physically gruelling 2 hour training session. I have zero time to breathe. My boss is very manipulative and loves guilt tripping his staff so how can I bring this up with him?

Lagom P64
Highest price, but seems to be the best quality, long term reliability. Coffee quality seems possibly the best, but not massively better than the other options (certainly not 2.5 times the quality). But build quality / reliability may make it with it. Can get for AUD$2,300

DF64V
Some good features with the latest build. Better size than some of the other DF grinders that I may struggle to fit. Seems easier to maintain, change burrs, and reliable than the 064s but less so than the P64. Some features seem a bit cheap (odd wooden block). But considerably cheaper at AUD$1,099. 

064s 
Cheapest option. Good size and some nice workflow ideas. Does seem to be a limited range for espresso grinds, and more difficult to open/maintain and more reports of quality issues compared to other options. 

Any experience from those that have used or researched these grinders. Also, burr options if I have a choice when ordering?

So ayun I'm (m30) a big4 grad and a licensed civil engineer working in the field for almost 9 years. And I met this redditor na lawyer daw (f29) yesterday to have some coffee. Big 4 grad din daw siya but we're not from the same school. First impression pa lang hindi na maganda dating sakin. Nauna ko sa SB so naghintay hintay panko mga around 10 mins, then dumating siya (naka grab) so sinalubong ko siya dun sa babaan. Pag baba niya, dii niya ko pinansin kung di pa ko nag hi then she responded ""di ko ineexpect na ganyan pala height mo"". I'm only 5'3, e kasalanan ko ba yon? Maliit din yung parents ko?  Pero di naman siya mas matangkad sakin, i think same or mas mataas lang ako ng konti. But regardless, wala naman siyang narinig na panget sakin kahit she's unpleasant to the eye. Di siya mukhang lawyer (in my point of view since judger naman ako) haha siguro I would rate her 2/10. Mataas pa nga to considering na ganun itsura niya, tapos sobrang baduy pa ng outfit na parang 2010 vibes na parang aattend lang ng groupings nung high school. 

Going back sa kwento, nakaroder na kami at umupo sa corner na table since yun lang yung vacant at pang isang tao lang halos yung size ng table. Nauna siya kasi gusto nya dun sa pwesto na yun then ako. Pag upo ko, tumama yung paa ko sa kanya, tapos sinungitan agad ako na ""inapakan"" ko daw siya. Na hindi ko naman sinasadya na extended yung paa nya dun at ang liit lang nung table. Nagsorry naman ako immediately. Then okay na yung order tinatawag na yung name niya, e medyo malayo yung pwesto namin at di ko narinig agad dahil mas rinig ko pa yung boses nung nasa likod ko. Sinungitan ulit ako kunin ko na daw yung drinks. Nag sorry naman din agad ako tapos kinuha ko na, pero di naman necessary yung ganung tone of voice. 3 strikes na yun para sakin at gusto ko na umalis. Pero syempre I'm trying to be nice pa rin. It was just a friendly meet up and napalaki naman ako nang maayos ng father ko enough para hindi mangup@l ng tao. 

Pero kahit ganon nakipag usap pa rin ako ng matino, at dahil we're from different firm e ayun yung naging topic ng usapan. I asked her things na related sa field niya para lang maging relevant yung usapan. Sumasagot naman siya, pero nung napunta na dun sa nagtanong ako regarding sa case ko with sss, nanghingi ng fee ampo0t@. Tapos hindi siya tunog joke at sobrang hard ng tone. Kofal ka va vos? Anddami nan strikes gusto ko na umuwi. Then napunta naman sakin yung topic, eto na yung word na hindi ko alam kung english ba o ano kasi tunog latin. I told her na hindi lang yung basta na plan na makikita mo sa google yung meron kami since nasa big firm ako. Then sinabi ko sa kanya yung tawag sa mga plans and mga difference non at similarities. Sabi ko merong exactly the same drawing na plan pero magkaiba ng name dahil magkaibang part of construction siya gamit. Tapos sinabi nya, ""Ah magkaiba lang sila ng *nomenclature*"" Eh sobrang alien sakin nung word as in, in my 30 years of existence hindi ko pa siya narinig or nabasa somewhere so wala akong idea na may word pala na ganun. Napasabi ako ng ""ha?"" Sagot ba naman sakin, ""Akala ko ba big4 grad ka?"" Hala tapos anlakas nung boses nya. Sobrang uncomfortable na gusto ko na talaga umuwi. E sa hindi ko naman alam na may ganun palang word, sabi niya rin na i search ko. Pero di naman ako ganun ka mangmang para di ko magets yun sinabi niya na term. Since nomen means name di ko na alam yung kasunod pero sa pagkakagamit niya nung word e naintindihan ko naman. Talagang di ko lang alam na may ganun pala na word. After non tinanong niyabkung anong batch daw ako graduate kasi may friend daw siya na schoolmate ko. Na pinakita niya pa picture sakin at kilala ko yun pero hindi ko naman naging kaklase same course lang kami. E di ko na feel magbigay ng personal info dahil sa mga lumalabas sa bibig niya na di ko nagustuhan sabi ko di ko alam. Di ko sasagutin yan. I even told her na sobrang uncomfortable na ko kaya di na ko magsasalita. Sabi ba naman, mag bobook na daw siya ng grab at uuwi na. Hahahahaha pakealam ko ba kung umuwi na siya e mas gusto ko nga yun. Sinabihan pa kong fraud at tinanong alin daw sa mga sinabi ko yung di totoo. Unang una wala akong balak makipagkita sa kanya dahil marami rin akong ginagawa at kakagaling ko lang sa sakit. Siya lang tong may gusto for some reason. Di ako interested sa kanya kahit di ko pa siya nakikita, lalo na nung nakita ko na siya. Buti na lang nagkaron ng pagkakataon na makatayo at umuwi na kasi di ko na gusto yung nangyayari. 

Kahit ganun yung nangyari, pinilit ko pa rin maging nice sa kanya. Kahit nasayang yung oras ko. Hahaha bwisit na nomenclature yan nasabihan pa kong fraud. Pero lawyer naman siya e, pwede niya ko ipakulong kasi pumipirma ako sa structural plans e kung fraud nga ako bawal yun. Hahahaha yun lang. Share ko lang huhuhu

Thankfully last week I bought a walking pad. Starting tomorrow I’m vowing to walk 2hours a day on it. I don’t think I’ll make any major dietary changes as I actually don’t even eat unhealthy (that’s the most depressing part!!!)

I (24m) had undoubtedly the worst migraine of my life on this past Tuesday 5(days ago) I was out to breakfast and took a sip of coffee (caffeine used to be a major trigger for me when I was in middle/HS for migraines but hasn’t been in a problem in my 20s) and immediately felt out of place and super off and started slurring my words and going kinda numb in the face. I left the restaurant and after about 20 minutes the pain started so I knew I had a migraine. I took a maxalt which I had been prescribed but it didn’t help and after a 2 hour nap I woke up to the worst headache of my life and it would not go away all day. Anyway normally I wake up from a deep sleep and I’ll have a tiny residual headache but other than that I’ll be 100%. However, this time I woke up and the unbearable pain was still there. I managed to take some excedrin for it and that helped enough to go to work but after 4 days I was still in incredible pain and dependent on excedrin (migraine specifically). Anyway I wake up today with no pain but in the head but some horrible vertigo like symptoms and numbness in my face and left side. It’s been over 12 hours now and i went to the ER for it and they did a CT scan and blood work and both were clean and they referred me back to my primary care or a neurologist. I plan on making the appt this week but I wanted to see if anyone had any recommendations for alleviating this in the meantime.

1g326u7,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1g326u7/im_childfree_and_my_best_friend_is_not_its/,i’m childfree and my best friend is not it’s causing our friendship to crash  ,"she had her first kid on accident with her ex boyfriend at 20. there relationship didn’t last they broke up months after the kid was born. she had to move back in with the baby to her mothers house. the dad doesn’t have much to do with there kid either only seeing the kid a few days a month. she is now 25 and 2 years ago moved out of her moms into a house with her new bf. the house is small, old, i hate to admit it’s run down and reminds me of the poor conditions i lived in as a child myself and she has been my friend for 10 years and i’ve always been in the “i don’t think i want kids” mindset. 

at the beginning of this year me and my partner moved a few states away to a beautiful place in the mountains, we have a nice home big enough for the 2 of us, i had gotten a new car, my man has gotten a new car, we’ve gone to serval concerts this year, went on a cruise, met a group of friends here who are childfree. we weren’t going for child free friends it just happened that way. We go out with these friends every weekend, bowling, arcades, bars, festivals. 

my best friend back home who sees my post of all these places i’m going and all these new friends has made statements about me “forgetting about her” and “moving away and leaving her” which doesn’t make sense to me as we talk every single day throughout the day.  i thought she just misses me at first but 

she lately has only sent me complaints about her life. she says how she hasn’t slept, how her kid is being bad, about how the house is dirty, how she needs a job, no where will hire her bc she found out the was pregnant again a few months ago. she’s made it known she’s upset they aren’t married, that this baby wasn’t planned either. she quit her job at the beginning of the year to be a stay at home mom. then her car broke down and no longer runs. she has no money saved get a new one and for whatever reasons told me she tried to get a loan and was denied. she even told me what her perfect day would look like and it’s literally my day to day lifestyle. 

she’s gotten upset with me for telling her good news like how me and bf have talked about marriage, he’s asked for a ring size, etc due to her not being married as a mother. she’s gotten upset with me showing her outfits as i’ve always been slim. she immediately will start talking about how she’s “fat” and looks “years older than me now” she use to be really into the gym and is very upset with how her body looks after her first pregnancy in 2020 as even with the gym the weight isn’t falling off. i compliment her but it doesn’t do much. 

i don’t know what to say to her? how to console her. while we text through out the day it’s all about her personal issues. which is starting to become draining. whenever i text her about an issue i’m having she tells me “i don’t know” and short responses leaves me on delivered for hours to even send a text about how she’s making dinner late and her kid pee’d on themself 3 times that day and how she doesn’t have a ride to her dr appt. 

i feel bad for her, she’s having regret of having kids young and is obviously jealous of my lifestyle as a child free woman. she will talk about how she wishes she had the money to get her hair done, nails done, how she wishes she could go out and have a wild night like she did at 19. i’ve started to not post as much on social media i use to post my new manicures, hair cuts, coffee, dinner dates, etc but now i’ve stopped bc i think in the back of my mind how i don’t want her to feel sad seeing me doing the things she can’t and wants too. but i also i feel she is being a bad friend only using me lately as a form text diary to send me texts of all the stressful things in her day to day instead of how things use to be before she had kids.

1g326id,https://www.reddit.com/r/paypigsupportgroup/comments/1g326id/story_personal_atm_16/,STORY: Personal ATM (16),"Very early on a Sunday morning, Mark was already dreading going into work on Monday.  After the events of the previous week and the difficult conversation with Yahira, he found little motivation with his job other than to collect a paycheck every week.  Not wanting to spend the day alone in his apartment, he picked up his phone and did something he knew he’d regret.

Mark: *“Hey, you want to hang out at the Plaza today?  I just need a friend right now.  I’ll treat you to something.”*

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*

Steffi’s phone lit up with Mark’s text preview.  Still asleep, she didn’t hear the initial chime.  Nate, who was already awake and holding her from behind, leaned over her to peak at her phone on the nightstand.  The jostling woke her up.

“You’re still here?  Go home,” she implored as she tried to go back to sleep.  Her phone chimed again.

“I didn’t know you were still seeing Mark.”

“What?  What are you talking about?”  She picked up her phone and glanced at Mark’s text.  “Oh…well, we’re not really seeing each other.”

“What does that mean?”

“What does it matter?” she raised her voice, clearly becoming agitated.  “Go home!  Let me sleep...”

Without another word, he got out of her bed, got dressed, gave her a kiss, and let himself out.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*

After another hour Steffi woke up again, relieved to find herself in an empty bed.  The first thing she did was to reach for her phone.  With a clearer head, she read Mark’s text again and it seemed noticeably off to her.

Steffi: *“Good morning.  Are you feeling ok?”*

Mark: *“I’ve been better.  If you’re busy, that’s ok.”*

Steffi: *“I’m free today.”*

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*

Enjoying the warm mid morning weather, they sat outside of a bakery over coffee and croissants.  Mark wasn’t forthcoming about what was bothering him, so Steffi took the initiative.

“It’s about your coworker, isn’t it?” she deduced.

He opened up and explained what Yahira had told him—the nature of their relationship seemed to change without any warning.  He just couldn’t understand what happened.  “Yeah, so it’s pretty much over.”

“Mark, I don’t think it ever started to begin with,” she stated trying to be as gentle as possible.  “Yes, she’s very cute...and I have a pretty good idea what your type is.  And I also know you fall hard.”

“Oh, do you?” he asked rhetorically.  He was unsure what she was getting at other than stating the obvious.

Picking up on a thread to cheer him up, she made a suggestion. “Let's go.  Stop feeling sorry for yourself.”  She stood up, grabbed his hand, and pulled him toward her.  “You said you were going to treat me to something.”  Even after all they've been through, she knew this was his unique way of being cheered up.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*

They walked around the luxury open-air shopping center.  They simply window-shopped and talked in a way that was familiar to both of them.  It lightened their moods as it felt very comfortable.  Mark slowly thought less about Yahira even though it seemed temporary.  Steffi thought less about the superficial arrangement she fell into with Nate, though the sexual energy was still real.  The mood tensed slightly when she led him into the Gucci store.

""Relax, I'm not going to make you buy me anything.""  She reassured him, sensing his tension.

Relaxing at her reassurance, he joked around about the ridiculousness of overpriced designer handbags and the suckers who buy them.

""Oh, you mean all the boyfriends and husbands who buy them?  Those suckers?  Or did you mean the coworkers?""  Although they were clearly joking around, she realized a raw nerve may have been struck.  ""Oops, sorry.  Too soon.""

""No, I deserved that,"" he flashed an understated smile.

She humored his continued snarky observations as she browsed handbags that caught her eye.  After having circled through the whole store, he turned toward the direction of the exit.  She reached out and stopped him.

""Well, we're here...you and me,” she said.

“Yes…” he wondered what she was getting at.

She looked over to her favorite handbag.  “Why don't you be the real boyfriend and buy that one?""  She looked at him intently waiting for an answer.

The shock hit him as he realized what she was proposing.  ""Wait...are you saying...you and me?""

""Yes.  Buy me that, and I'll be your girlfriend again,"" she cooed in an innocent yet seductive manner.  “That is what you’ve always wanted, isn’t it?”

Whatever psychological block he had in place was beaten back and smashed to pieces.  His sound judgment went out the window.

She could see what was happening to him before her eyes.  While not intentional, his helplessness seduced her.  She confidently pressed forward, dropping the innocence.  ""Of course, the bag will win me over for just today.  But then again, you always knew how to be so generous to me.""

“What are you saying?”

Sensing very little resistance, she continued.  ""I’m a high maintenance girl as you already know.  You were paying me $1000 a week before.  Why don't we start with that?  We can figure things out as we go.""

She nodded her head and he mimicked her as if on cue.

Ignoring the other people in the store, she stepped closer to him without breaking eye contact.  She reached out and held his hand.  ""We don't have to do this, you know?""",2,1728860402.0,paypigsupportgroup,2,1.0,False

I had GD with both my pregnancies, and end up always looking great at the end of each pregnancy only to go ham on all things pizza, dessert, sodas after birth because I missed them so much. I swore I would be more conscientious this time and resume a healthier diet, but here I am 5 weeks later continuing to pack on the Lbs. 

Part of my problem is I have a lot of “musts.” If I eat, I “must” have a sweet treat after. If I go on a walk, I “must” get a coffee. If I have BBQ, I “must” have a Dr. Pepper. And the list goes on. 

Does anyone have any ideas on how I can trick my brain and romanticize eating healthy and working out?

For example:
- A fun routine you’ve created
- A certain fitness class that makes you feel cool or trendy
- Something you do during, before, or after a workout that makes it seem more fun or luxurious (sauna, swim, food, activity)
- A certain drink you love (I’m big on drinks and need to find new ones, maybe a green drink or something that makes you feel happy yet you are living healthy)
- Workout clothes that make you feel good (I need to buy ones that fit my current body, not use my old ones from when I was 21 years old - a long time ago)

1g3268h,https://www.reddit.com/r/unique_verse/comments/1g3268h/unlock_the_power_of_mindfulness_simple_practices/,Unlock the Power of Mindfulness: Simple Practices for a More Present and Peaceful Life,"In a world filled with noise, distractions, and endless to-do lists, what if the secret to living more fully lies in doing *less*? That’s the beauty of mindfulness — a powerful, accessible practice that can transform how you experience every moment of your day.

**What is Mindfulness?**

Mindfulness is the art of being fully present in the moment, without judgment. It’s about tuning into your thoughts, feelings, and surroundings with intention, rather than allowing your mind to wander into the past or future. It’s not about emptying your mind or forcing yourself into a state of calm; it’s about noticing and accepting whatever is happening right now, just as it is.

When we practice mindfulness, we cultivate awareness, which helps us respond to life’s challenges with clarity, patience, and balance. It’s a simple yet profound way to reduce stress, increase focus, and enhance your overall well-being.

  
**How Can You Incorporate Mindfulness into Your Daily Life?**

1. **Start with Your Breath: The Gateway to Presence** Your breath is always there, anchoring you to the present moment. Take a moment, right now, to breathe deeply and slowly. Inhale through your nose, feeling your lungs fill with air. Exhale through your mouth, releasing any tension. Whenever you feel distracted or stressed, return to this breath. This simple act of breathing mindfully can bring you back to the center in any situation, making it one of the easiest and most effective mindfulness tools.
2. **Mindful Eating: Savor Every Bite** How often do you rush through meals without really tasting your food? Mindful eating is about savoring each bite and paying attention to the flavors, textures, and sensations as you eat. Put away your phone, sit at the table, and fully engage with your meal. By being present while eating, not only do you enjoy your food more, but you also give your body a chance to properly digest and signal when it's full.
3. **Mindful Breaks: Small Moments of Peace** In the middle of a busy day, it’s easy to get caught up in the whirlwind of tasks and distractions. Try incorporating small mindful breaks into your routine. Step outside for a five-minute walk, stretch your arms, or simply close your eyes and focus on your breath. These moments of mindfulness can recharge your mind and body, helping you return to your tasks with greater clarity and energy.
4. **Engage Fully in Conversations: Be There, Not Somewhere Else** In our digital age, we’re often multitasking during conversations, checking our phones, or thinking about what to say next. Instead, when you talk to someone, give them your full attention. Put aside distractions, look them in the eye, and listen to what they’re saying. Mindful conversations foster deeper connections, improve empathy, and make interactions more meaningful.
5. **Gratitude Practice: Mindfulness Through Appreciation** Gratitude is one of the most powerful ways to incorporate mindfulness into your daily life. At the end of each day, take a moment to reflect on three things you're grateful for. It could be something small, like a delicious cup of coffee, or something bigger, like a meaningful conversation. This simple practice shifts your focus from what’s missing or wrong to what’s already good in your life.
6. **Mindful Movement: Get in Tune with Your Body** Whether it’s yoga, walking, or just stretching, practicing mindful movement can help you connect with your body in a new way. Instead of rushing through your exercise, focus on how your body feels with each movement. Notice the tension releasing as you stretch, or the rhythm of your steps as you walk. This approach can turn physical activity into a form of meditation, helping you become more grounded and in tune with yourself.

**Final Thoughts:**

Mindfulness isn’t about changing your entire life; it’s about changing how you experience the moments of your life. It’s about finding joy in the present, reducing stress, and learning to respond thoughtfully to life’s challenges. You don’t need to carve out hours of your day — even a few minutes of mindfulness can make a world of difference.

So why not take a few minutes today to simply *be*? To breathe, notice, and appreciate the now? You might just find that the most profound transformations come not from doing more, but from doing less — with full attention and intention.",1,1728860379.0,unique_verse,0,1.0,False

Everyday I feel like death. The only thing that gives me a slight bit of a kick is energy drinks but I need to cut down on them. It only lasts an hour anyway. Coffee doesn’t do anything for me. I sleep 9-10 hours and have to force myself to stay awake in class. Even at work I stutter talking to people because I’m so tired. I make careless, stupid mistakes because I’m thinking about how tired I am. Another thing that slightly helps is eating a lot of food before I go to work but still. Any tips to battle the tiredness?.

1g3257g,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifehacks/comments/1g3257g/keeping_champagne_bubbly/,Keeping champagne bubbly,"Decades ago, I would sometimes have undrunk champagne still in the bottle when festivities wrapped up.
I had one of those closures that plugs the neck up rather effectively, but the next day it was always very close to flat.

My wife has probably drunk less than the equivalent of a bottle of champagne in the 23 years we've been married,  but she told her mother about a trick she learned about in high school that she said worked. I never for one second believed her.

We had my immediate family over for brunch yesterday and offered them mimosas. There were two takers and I had a small glass, so there was about 10 or so ounces left in the bottle.

My wife put it on the back steps without a cap, where it stated for 27 hours. It's not cold here at all, rather balmy really.

I just poured the last glass into a coffee mug. It was bubbling and frizzing like crazy.

What magic is this?, you might ask.

Answer: A silver spoon sticking down into the bottle but not touching the champagne. 

She has some solid silver iced tea spoons and she left one in the otherwise open bottle.

It definitely works ",4,1728860291.0,lifehacks,10,0.58,False

It's probably the coffee I have been drinking, especially on an empty stomach.

I'm going to occams razer it. See if I stop coffee if my panic attacks go away.

Hours later, I came down with a stomach bug. From then on, I gave away my keurig and refused to make coffee at home because I associated it with being sick. Not because I didn’t love coffee, but because I was afraid it would magically happen again if I made it. Well, 6 years later, I decided that I was going to challenge that fear and buy the nice Nespresso machine I have wanted but was too afraid to buy. I just got it today so I haven’t tried it out yet, but I am so proud of myself for challenging this fear because life is too short to not enjoy the things you enjoy.

All I did was eliminating the no foods (eggs, dairy, gluten, corn, soy, canola oil, alcohol, vinegar, coffee, pork, ecc), taking 32 ounce of celery juice in the morning, HMDS every day, cucumber juice in the afternoon and eating no fat until dinner. And I took many supplements (Vimergy): zinc, micro C, cat's claw, lysine, lemon balm, licorice root, olive leaf, vitamin b12, b complex and Lauracidin (monolaurin).

Unfortunately all this didn't move the needle and I'm thinking of doing a proper cleanse now. I'm afraid my symptoms will get worse due to a die off. Moreover in the 369 cleanses I'm afraid I'll starve for food and I'm already very underweight.

What was your experience with 369? Would you advise me to do the original or the advanced? Did you experience with improvement with original or advanced? And did you starve on that cleanse? Did you see some improvement already after the first 369?",1,1728860055.0,medicalmedium,2,1.0,False

we're mid-20s, no kids, just a cat, and share a fairly lax lifestyle. we enjoy very occasional nightlife, but we prefer to spend our time visiting local eats and coffee shops, shopping vintage clothing and furniture, trying crafts, visiting museums, and sight-seeing. we don't currently hike, but we take walks and try to be in nature when the heat isn't oppressive. when we move, we plan to shift lifestyles and start hiking much more. my girlfriend is a research assistant in the field of psychology, and is also working on her master's. i'm a lab technician with a recently-earned bachelor's degree in microbiology. combined, we make $84k a year. i hope that this number will increase, especially with my recent degree (and my expected increase from 32hrs/wk to 40 hrs/wk), but i know that the job market is often different in reality than it is on paper.

right now, we're considering Vancouver, WA, and not much else definitively. Eugene, Salem, and Corvallis, OR are on our radar in case my girlfriend has job search luck with contacts through her online master's program at UO. other than that, we are very interested in the outside-of-Seattle suburbs and towns, but we're both struggling to narrow down good fits. we don't want to be in a big city center, but we recognize that that's where the job opportunities are, so we're considering up to an hour commute to work. 

obviously, we will likely go where job opportunities take us, but i want to keep particularly good fits on my radar to make this huge life transition a bit easier. i apologize for any potential wordiness, but i want to cover my bases here. thanks in advance for any help!

I work as a barista & there’s a drink called a “London fog” which can be ordered hot or iced. It’s made with brewed earl grey tea, vanilla syrup & milk.

When made iced, my instructions are: 
Brew the tea, then add the boiling tea to a shaker with ice. Shake until cold. Add more ice & finish by adding milk.

I pointed out that if you combine the hot tea with the milk first, then it won’t be watered down by the ice so much- keeping most of the steeped flavour.

When I told my boss this, she said that the milk would curdle. For the record: I am working in the USA, but I am British, so I pointed out that that’s not how milk works— people put cold milk in hot tea every single day… that’s kind of how 90% of people drink hot tea.

My boss INSISTED that it wasn’t “food safe” according to the FDA & joked “did you just click through your food safety training??”

She pulled up an AI answer from Google, but when I went looking g to see what the FDA/food safety standards says, I couldn’t find anything definitive.

TL;DR—

Does the FDA / USA food handling certificate / USA health regulations say ANYTHING about whether one shouldn’t put cold milk into hot tea?

——

Edit:

It is SO funny that you guys keep mentioning coffee— I was SO thrown off by her comments that I didn’t even THINK to argue about coffee 💀 — also to be fair to her, my INITIAL instinct was to worry about milk curdling (why??? Idk, I think I’ve been in the USA too long, also because the process is to pour the hot tea onto the milk & also because it’s ultimately going to be a COLD drink as opposed to a hot one, so I think there’s a conceptual misdirect w/ the “danger zone” of food safety, but I KNOW that’s not a problem, because if you leave your milky tea to get cold, it doesn’t become dangerous lol)",63,1728859907.0,NoStupidQuestions,64,0.9,False
