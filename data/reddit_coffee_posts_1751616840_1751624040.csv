1lrf2ny,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lrf2ny/debating_to_break_up_or_not_long_relationship/,Debating to break up or not [long relationship],"Hello,

My partner (M34) and I (F29) have been together for almost 7years. We don’t argue much ever, we get on well, have common interests and spend time together often. He is faithful which was hard to find so far, and my family love him. He feels like part of my family. However, it’s my first long relationship and I have been very unsure recently.

For many years now I haven’t been feeling like having sex with him. I have a history of sexual abuse trauma, so the therapist thinks it’s linked and we’ve been working on it. But I am wondering if there isn’t more to it. I can imagine being with him for many years, but I struggle imagining getting married with him for some reason. But I’m not the type who ever dreamt of marriage neither.

Recently for a work event, I had a huge crush on a colleague. :( It’s the first time that it happens to me while I’m in a relationship; it caught me off guard, I suddenly found myself attracted to that men both physically and mentally. We spent two weeks working together everyday, had some deep and regular conversations about life, but nothing more. It was a temporary collaboration. I felt bad having a crush on him I told him that I have a partner early on, and at the end that I wouldn’t be able to meet him again as he suggested we grab a coffee together, or keep in touch. We both felt that connection, like when you meet someone that it just clicks with. He was obviously disappointed but thanks me for the time we had together and understood well my reasons.

It’s been almost a week since that happened and I can’t stop thinking of him and of that situation. It triggered a whole questioning in my head. I didn’t think I’d ever have such a crush on someone else while in a relationship. On the top of that, we are currently abroad and I love that country we are temporarily living in; I wish I could just stay here but my boyfriend doesn’t. I don’t have a visa and it is hard to find the right type of visa too. I could eventually get a 1-2 year visa but that’s it.

I really have been contemplating breaking up and starting over in that country but maybe it’s just a pipe dream. I feel like I’d loose it all, probably wouldn’t find someone like my boyfriend again who’s faithful, nice, loving and successful. He bought a beautiful house in our home country where we normally live too.. I feel like I would be so mean to break up because he did nothing wrong

I just feel so lost. Is it normal to be unsure at times about our long term partner even when things work out overall well? I am just self sabotaging a normal relationship?:(
Wouldn’t I have just the same issue down the road with just anyone else?

Every time I try to forget what transpired that day—what we saw, those ""things"", whatever the hell they were—I never seem able to let go of the incident. Now, I wish it could.

Well, I'm a geophysicist for the United States government's Federal Geological Division (USFGD for short). My job demands a tremendous amount of time investigating the Earth, primarily its surface and what lies beneath. For a while, I was focused on Arctic rock formations, which weren’t all that engaging.

I received a new assignment: research the outer core for the *Radiant Corp.*, the USFGD’s most esteemed branch focused on inner structural research. I laughed, thinking it was some elaborate joke. What caught me off guard was how I was contacted. Only top geologists were employed by Radiant, yet, somehow, I was among them, likely due to my rigorous, well-regarded papers on core seismology. Opting out of work at my main office, I was directed to a site eight hours away after packing a few changes of clothes and research gear. I suspected this was going to be a significant endeavor.

Teetering on the edge of passing out at the wheel, I finally made it to the site after the grueling drive. The sheer size of the place floored me. Hell, the building was so enormous it could’ve passed as its own sovereign state. Rolling up to the gate, I was stunned to find no security checkpoint. Normally, there’d be at least some screening—and for a facility like this, you’d expect military-level oversight.

Just as I was mulling this over, a figure emerged—a silhouette clad in a sharp suit. I figured this was the man in charge. He motioned for me to stop and exit the vehicle.

I got out and was welcomed by the man, dressed head to toe in black with a blood-red tie. He had dark, straight hair, piercing blue eyes that seemed to look through you, and a grin that lacked even a hint of sincerity.

""Greetings, Dr. Cochran. We’re glad you could join us on such short notice. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Your work on seismic activity and Earth’s structural dynamics has been both brilliant and illuminating. That sort of genius doesn’t go unnoticed. That’s why I brought you here—to help us with something important,"" he rasped, sounding like a jaded university lecturer.

""Well, thank you. The drive was brutal, so I’m a little drained. Is there a hotel nearby I could crash at?""

He hesitated, then responded quickly. ""Ah, no need for that! We have accommodations inside the facility. If you’re tired, by all means rest. I’ll walk you to your quarters.""

I nodded, thanked him, and followed him toward the massive, foreboding structure. Under the exterior lighting, I realized we were walking through a vacant lot leading up to the building’s entryway. The entrance was a sterile white tunnel devoid of sound or motion—it sent a chill straight through me.

""So, sir, I’ve got a few questions: Who are you, exactly? Why was I brought here? And what’s the compensation for my involvement?"" I asked, my voice wavering—this man radiated serious “you won’t wake up tomorrow” energy.

""Oh yes, I should’ve briefed you sooner. I’m the director of research and chief scientist of the USFGD’s Radiant branch. Name’s Barron Moreland. People around here just call me “Dir. Moreland”, but with your credentials and impressive contributions, let’s be informal and stick with Moreland. I’m tasked with overseeing all federal geological research and experiments.

""My team and I brought you and a select group of scientists here because this trial involves highly specialized geological expertise. You’ve worked extensively in Whole-Earth geology, which is exactly what we need. I’ve been developing this project for some time, especially after we noticed “atypically pronounced frequencies” originating deep in the mantle.

""As for payment, we’re offering you double your standard rate. This isn’t easy work—we know that—and you won’t be shortchanged. Please understand.""

I nodded again, and we moved through the deserted parking lot toward the tunnel. Moreland paused, seemingly waiting on something—I wasn’t sure what.

A few minutes passed. Then, without a word, he resumed his stride into the tunnel. I followed. Silence returned. Darkness enveloped everything. Time lost all meaning. I pushed my exhausted body to keep up with Moreland’s inhuman pace. Even when I lagged, he didn’t slow. Everything felt off, but I focused on the promised compensation.

After what seemed like hours, I finally glimpsed a faint light ahead.

""Alright then, we’re here. That light marks the sleeping quarters. Rest up. We begin the project after you’ve had some sleep.""

I examined the sleeping area. What unsettled me wasn’t the lighting or layout—it was the design. The rooms resembled containment units more than resting quarters. We passed several metallic doors marked with numbers, only visible in the soft center-room glow. We stopped at a room labeled 255. Moreland fumbled with the keys like a lunatic. Eventually, he unlocked it and swung open the door.

The interior was bleak: a single bed with a barebones pillow-and-sheet setup and a toilet to the side. The whole scene reeked of bad intentions.

""G’night, Cochran. I’ll see you in the morning.""

A thunderous knock jerked me awake:
""WAKE UP SLEEPING BEAUTY!"" someone called out cheerily. ""Breakfast is ready!""

I rubbed my eyes and slipped on my shoes. With no windows in the place, I couldn’t even guess what time it was. The door creaked open, revealing a tall, dark-skinned man with a solid build, a stern face, and metal-lined teeth. He looked thoroughly joyless.

He motioned for me to follow him, so I did, toward a thick green door labeled EATING QUARTERS.

""Well, well. Morning to you. Looks like someone’s had decent shut-eye. Let’s sit down and go over the day’s plans over breakfast.""

I took a seat at a table that looked just like the ones at my old research facility’s cafeteria. We made small talk until the head chef brought out the meal.

To my surprise, despite the dismal sleeping arrangements, the breakfast was fantastic: two strips of roasted cinnamon bacon, four evenly sized waffles, scrambled and over-easy eggs, and French toast. Moreland just had bacon and a strong black Italian coffee.

""Dr. Cochran, let me explain the gravity of this operation. As I said, my team and I became interested because of the situation’s nature. Supposedly, some of my peers received reports about peculiar sounds detected under the crust. I dug into them myself. Found some bizarre soundwaves—but sadly, no audio recordings.

""That’s where you come in. You’re more experienced with seismic audio work. If you can gather a proper sample, we might finally close this chapter.""

His explanation piqued my curiosity. I remembered a similar case, dismissed as a natural anomaly. I never bought that, but couldn’t pursue it due to a sudden directive from Dir. Moreland. Odd, in hindsight.

""Moreland, I’m in. I think this could lead to some remarkable findings.""

The bastard smiled that same crooked smile, stood, and waved me toward a different exit.

We stepped into a narrow corridor and reached another door. Inside was an immense hole, dead center in the floor, surrounded by a chaos of monitors, towers, and gear.

""This is your workspace. Everything’s ready. Now get started—immediately.""

Nodding, I dared to ask:
""Moreland, sir... just how complete is this setup?""

""All you have to do is safely send the equipment down. Collect graphical and audio readings and forward them to my associates. I’ll give you their contacts. Finish fast and you’ll be on your way—with payment, no strings attached.""

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **AFL Showdown: Carlton Blues vs. Collingwood Magpies – A Tale of Two Teams**  
*By The Handicapper with a Pencil-Thin Grip on Reality*

**The Setup**  
The Carlton Blues, fresh off a two-game losing streak and a roster that’s been more “Russian Roulette” than “strategic depth,” host the Collingwood Magpies, who are riding a six-game winning streak and have the swagger of a team that’s already mentally checked out the rest of the AFL. It’s a clash of chaos vs. consistency, and the MCG is about to become a pressure cooker.

**Key Stats & Injuries**

* **Carlton**: A dumpster fire of a season (6-9 record), axing four players and losing two to injury. Their offense? A leaky faucet. Their defense? A sieve with a personality.
* **Collingwood**: The AFL’s version of a Marvel superhero, led by the return of Tom Mitchell (13.5 disposals/game) and Brayden Maynard (2.1 goals/game). They’ve won 11 of 13 against Carlton since 2020, including a 30-point average margin.

**Odds Breakdown**

* **Collingwood (-30.5, 1.11)**: The bookmakers are so confident in the Pies, they’re giving them a 30.5-point line and charging you like you’re betting on a sunrise. Implied probability? A staggering **90.09%**.
* **Carlton (+30.5, 5.75)**: The underdog’s line is so generous, it’s like the bookies are saying, “Bet on this team and we’ll throw in a free lottery ticket.” Implied probability? A laughable **17.39%**.

**The Math of Madness**  
Let’s get nerdy. The user provided underdog win rates: **41%** for sports like soccer/hockey/baseball (we’re assuming AFL is in this camp). For Carlton, the implied probability (17.39%) is **23.61% lower** than the historical underdog win rate. That’s a golden ticket in betting terms.

**Expected Value (EV) Calculation**

* **Carlton’s EV**:
   * Underdog win rate: 41%
   * Implied probability: 17.39%
   * **Split the difference**: (41% - 17.39%) = **23.61% edge**.
   * **Payout**: 5.75 (DraftKings) = 475% return on a $100 bet if they win.
* **Collingwood’s EV**:
   * Implied probability: 90.09%
   * Actual probability? Even if they’re hot, 90% is absurd. Let’s say 70% (still generous).
   * **Split the difference**: (70% - 90.09%) = **-20.09% edge**.

**The Verdict**  
While Collingwood is the most likely winner (70%+), **Carlton offers the best EV**. Why? Because the line is so generous that even a 41% chance (per the underdog rate) gives you a **23.61% edge**. It’s the sportsbook equivalent of finding a $20 bill in a parking lot.

**Final Call**  
**Bet: Carlton Blues (+30.5) at 5.75 (DraftKings)**

* **Why?** The EV is astronomical. Even if Collingwood wins, the line is so high you’ll still profit if Carlton covers (-30.5). And if they shock the world? You’re looking at a 475% payout.
* **Sarcasm Check**: “Oh, you’re betting on Carlton? Bold move! They’re like the ‘team that almost made the playoffs’ in your fantasy league.”

**Spread the Love**

* **Under 174.5 Total Points**: The line is 174.5, and Collingwood’s defense has held opponents to 85 points/game this season. With Carlton’s offense sputtering, this feels like a safe “Under” play.

**Injuries to Watch**

* **Carlton**: Losing two starters is a death sentence, but Collingwood’s key returns (Mitchell, Maynard) mean they’re healthier than the Blues.

**TL;DR**  
Collingwood is the favorite, but Carlton’s line is so juicy it’s a no-brainer for EV hunters. Bet the underdog, sip your coffee, and enjoy the chaos.

*“The only thing more certain than Collingwood’s win is the fact that this line is a gift from the betting gods.”* 🏆💸

I can’t look forward to coffee dates with my clients that beg me constantly to take them out like we used to. I can’t sit outside in the sun because the heat makes me pass out. I don’t have the strength to play with my dog. The one thing I’ve been able to do to distract myself is crochet. And I can’t do it anymore because my hands either shake so bad, or, are too weak to grip my hook and yarn. I just sit and stare at the wall for hours.

I don’t care about healing anymore. I don’t care about looking forward to anything. I’m just stuck, in this damn bed, staring at my wall until I eventually pass out. I’ve started considering taking extra sleeping meds so I can jsut sleep my days away. I’m not sick or hungry or in pain in my sleep. I can dream. Good ones or bad ones doesn’t matter to me. I just want something else to focus on. My therapist says im sabotaging myself. Slipping into an accidental cycle of self harm. I don’t intend on causing myself harm. It’s not my goal or even a want tbh. I just can’t bring myself to look forward to anything anymore. I can’t tell anyone or else they’ll worry and cry. I can’t be more of a burden. I’m already babysat around the clock by close friends and family in fear of me passing out and hitting my head again. I can’t expend the energy needed to comfort them. I can barely comfort myself. I’m just stuck, in a never ending cycle. 

I’m sorry this is so dark. I’m not in danger. I’m safe with my wife sleeping next to me as I type this. I’m never alone. I just needed to say something. I’m sorry for anyone else feeling this way. I would give anything to be my old self from 8 months ago. For even just a day. I have my therapy twice a week. I take my mental health meds the best I can. I reach out to family and friends. It’s just not enough anymore. My wife says I’m suicidal at this point. Me not forcing myself to eat and drink is essentially me teetering on the edge of just jumping. I don’t agree with her, I don’t even care enough to kms. I don’t have the energy. But I get what she’s saying. Their solution is just eat anyways. Drink anyways. Even if you get sick. Even if you’re in pain. They jsut don’t understand how bad it can be. How difficult your relationship with food becomes when your body is essentially poisoning you against it. And it’s not to say every day is torture. I have good days here and there, but not enough for comfort. I just don’t want to censor myself anymore. I’m not okay. I’m not doing well.

I do 18:6 intermittent fasting but I do have the habit of going a bit off the rails a bit on my 6 hour eating windows. I've experimented with 36 hour fasts in the past, but that's all it was, experimentation. 

The other day I ate so much I just felt awful and woke up even feeling bloated and full. I just felt, ugh! So I just decided I'd had enough, It was time for a reset. So boom, time for a 36 hour fast. I stopped eating at 10pm the night before, so knew that I just had to get through the day, go to bed and get through just a few hours the following morning. 

When it got to my usual time to eat, I had a black coffee and then went out a walk (daily 10k step walker here). When I came back I had some green tea. I honestly find that hot drinks, tea especially, give you something to do and really take your mind off eating. And tea and coffee were pivotal to this fast. I also drank a tonne of water, think pints at any one time.

So how does this realign your brain? Well the hunger 'pangs' come and go. I looked it up and they last 30 minutes which is more or less true. But ultimately I gradually forgot about food. I couldn't believe how much of a relief it was not to dwell over what to eat, thinking about lunchtime and what to make for dinner. I started to realise just how much of my day was dedicated into thinking about food. So instead, I began chipping away at some projects, tidied the flat and suddenly felt quite productive.

I woke up the following morning and still felt good! When it got to 10am I still wasn't really hungry and waited until 12 to have some scrambled eggs. That day I just had that and a healthy dinner. No snacks or overeating! I honestly feel like I've had a reset. My mood is better, I only really eat when I'm hungry and feel like my outlook is overall better. It feels like my body has been given the chance to have a big sigh of relief and that goes for my brain too. I feel clearer. I'm not thinking about food as 'the answer' and instead focusing more on projects and productivity. I feel comfortable feeling hungry more, and recognise that that can be a positive way to feel. And dare I say, I feel like a little bit more optimistic about life as well. Well, within reason of course.

I'm now considering doing one of these fasts every week now because it honestly feels like a really positive thing to do :)

TLDR - 36 hour fasts reset not just your body but your brain. You feel refreshed and more positive as a result

(To understand splurge and daily essentials I’ll explain I use the Barefoot Investors savings plan. 60% of your income into daily essentials (things you need), 10% into splurges (daily coffees, lunch out, basically things you want), 10% into smile (holidays, bigger purchases) and 20% into emergency fund/long term savings (medical emergency, house deposit etc))

The activewear would also be used for its main purpose: being active (gym). It would also be used for running basic errands. 

The active wear I have is four years old now and is a cheaper $30 per piece brand. 

I’d be looking at investing in better quality so it’s be a bit more money. 

Curious on people’s thoughts on this one. ",0,1751622961.0,personalfinance,7,0.33,False

[artist: jambadi \(telegram\)](https://preview.redd.it/558ylkg5ytaf1.png?width=4200&format=png&auto=webp&s=81c1c7c32dd4e9725adb873118073d02c2a25ca0)

**Good day! Thank you for agreeing to answer our questions. How are you feeling today?**

**Yim:** I'm doing quite well today. It feels like life is slowing down enough that I have a bit more time and space to recharge.

**Let’s begin!**

**1. Could you tell us how you came up with the idea to write a story in the medical genre? Why did you choose to set the plot specifically in an emergency department?**

**Yim:** I pitched several ideas for stories that didn't move forward, and I was encouraged to work on a medical story focusing on an EMS team. I proposed emergency medicine as an alternative because the scope of the medicine practiced there can be shallow or broad: it offers a lot of flexibility for writing. Patients often come and go from the department quickly, and their cases can be simple or very complicated, humorous or heartbreaking. The structure of work in the emergency department also seems well suited to work for a Romance Club story.

**2. What inspired the storyline? Were there any particular films, series, or books that influenced you?**

**Yim:** The storyline is the product of sitting with the subject matter for a while and considering what would be interesting and well-suited for an RC story. For inspiration, I primarily turned to television series, documentaries, and doctors’ memoirs, and also to the city of Seattle itself, where I lived for many years. I wanted to achieve a balance between the medical and romance aspects while keeping the visuals interesting. In terms of particular films, series, and books, as unlikely a pairing as it is, I think this story falls somewhere between Scrubs (which I enjoyed watching as a teenager) and The Pitt. Adam Kay's This is Going to Hurt, and numerous other sources have influenced me.

**3. Why did you choose this specific title for the story? Were there any alternative options?**

**Yim:** For this story, I proposed the title ""Vitals"", which I liked because it applied to more than just the medical aspect, but it was decided that it was not interesting enough, so it was given the title that it has now.

**4. How much time did it take you to develop the plot?**

**Yim:** The very basic premise and plot was developed over the course of a month. There are many minor plotlines will develop organically over the course of the story to support the higher level plot, though.

**5. Is it possible to combine two stat paths in the story, or is it better to focus on just one?**

**Yim:** No, it's best to focus on just one.

**6. How many seasons are planned for the story?**

**Yim:** 3

**7. Let’s talk about the characters! What made you decide to give players the option to choose the protagonist’s gender?**

**Yim:** I was offered the opportunity to do so, and I jumped on it, much like including diverse body types in Hell and High Water. I think it fits very well with a story like this, where it's an aspirational story (many people are curious about what it would be like to be a doctor) and the story's plotline is not heavily influenced by the choice of gender (while sexism certainly affects modern medicine in Seattle, it has much less of an impact than it might on a historical drama about a monarch, for example).

**8. How challenging is it to write branching storylines from both male and female perspectives? Do you find it difficult or rather easy?**

**Yim:** It's somewhat challenging and rather fun. As a non-binary person, I ""played"" the female perspective (poorly and miserably) for more than 20 years and often wondered what it would be like to ""play"" the male perspective, though that didn't suit me either. So, it's certainly something I've spent a lot of time thinking about and talking to people about. And there isn't any one way to be male or female in terms of how one experiences the world, but I hope to write something that is relatable to many people.

**9. What key qualities do your main characters possess as professionals in the medical field?**

**Yim:** I think that dedication is a vital quality that they all possess, even if they show it in different ways. Medicine is a very difficult field in the USA, even for those who have ample opportunity, and it is an enormous commitment. Along with this, they possess patience in all areas: with themselves, others, situations, and systems. Not all of the characters are equally patient, but they are all probably more patient on average than most people. Also, the ability to work well under pressure and focus.

**10. How did you choose their names? Why did you settle on the ones featured in the story?**

**Yim:** This is a good opportunity to talk about Tobias and Trinh's names. I've seen a lot of comments about these in particular because these names also appear in Open Heart, which I enjoyed playing the first season and a half or so of many many years ago.

When I originally designed Tobias, he had a distinctive nose. I thought it gave him some more personality, but it was determined that this wasn't conventionally attractive enough, and it was ultimately changed. However, when I was young, one of my favorite characters was Tobias from Animorphs, whose form is a hawk. I have always had a soft spot for the name, and when I learned it suited Tobias's origins, I decided to call him that. I felt that he was a hawk-like character, keeping an eye on the department and having his distinctive nose.

Trinh is a very common last name in Seattle. I actually chose the name because I had a wonderful doctor with that surname, and it seemed like a nice way to honor them, though the nurse in the story and the actual doctor have nothing else in common.

In general, though, the names mostly depend on the character's origin. In some cases, they are names the characters chose for themselves.

**11. What was most important to you when visualizing the appearance of the main characters? Did they turn out the way you had envisioned?**

**Yim:** For me, the most important thing about a character's visual design is that it reinforces their life experience and personality. (Sometimes, this means that they don't look anything like one would expect, because people have a way of surprising us). I have learned that my idea of what is attractive doesn't match with what most people want, so for the LIs, I try to adhere to conventions for the most part, or what is seen as conventionally attractive for a given archetype. I'm very glad that Flint and Kenedi seem to be well received, because these are characters where there was less pressure to make them look a specific way and I was able to invest more in their designs (though I obviously made them very conventionally attractive within their own domains due to the extensive negative feedback I received on HHW's character designs). And with Jules, I'm also very glad that the many variations are being positively received. I was going for a very specific look with them, which will probably make more sense as the story progresses.

Given the circumstances, I'm very happy with how the characters turned out.

**12. How long did it take you to create their character briefs? How old are they?**

**Yim:** I could not easily tell you how long it took to create the briefs because it's spread out throughout the creation process. When the story is first pitched, the main cast starts to take form and their design starts, but it's not until after outlining and in some cases writing begins, that they are fully developed and ready to be brought to life by the artists. 

For ages, in order of appearance, here are a few:

Jules: 30 

Flint: 26

Nahome: 33

Kenedi: 30

Tobias: 44

Gutierrez: 27

Malinowski: 28

Gail: 37

Eugene: 29

Dakota: 27

**13. Will players have the chance to change the characters’ uniforms again, or will the current ones remain as final?**

**Yim:** There will be more work clothing options as the story progresses (and some seasonal accessories) but these won't be very common.

**14. We’re curious to know more about the romance options in your story! How many love interests are planned?**

**Yim:** There are 6 full romantic routes planned. There will also be some romantic interactions with other characters, such as Gutierrez, Malinowski, and characters we haven't met yet. I have already seen many comments on Gutierrez and Malinowski, and they are intended to be developed further, but they are not ""main"" LIs.

**15. If you could describe each love interest in one word, what would it be?**

**Yim:** I would describe all of them as ""complicated."" 

More seriously, though: 

Flint: Chaotic

Nahome: Healing

Kennedy: Uplifting

Tobias: Harrowing

Gail: Bittersweet

Eugen and Dakota: Playful

**16. Why did you choose marine creatures as pets in the story? Would you like to have one of them yourself? Or maybe you already do?**

**Yim:** I had a pet fish, Ruvi, who was very near and dear to my heart. I've kept a few bettas over the years, so I wanted to include one. And I hope that I might keep another in the future. This happens in the story is mostly because Annette doesn't really see fish as much different from plants, which unfortunately seems to be a pretty common view. To her, they're more of an aesthetic element. Jules definitely doesn't have the motivation to care for anything demanding at this point, and I didn't want to leave players with something like a cat or dog that would suffer much more while Jules is working hard.

**17. Does your workspace mean a lot to you? What items are a must-have there? We'd love to see a photo!**

**Yim:** My workspace is incredibly important to me, but right now it is very much a work in progress, so I won't be sharing it right now. My absolute must-haves are an ergonomic keyboard and active sitting chair.

**18. Do you have any rituals before you start working (if any)? Maybe you need to grab a cup of coffee or spend a few minutes in silence?**

**Yim:** Yes! I almost always start by grinding some beans and making a cup of coffee in my French press, and I usually finish my coffee before I actually start working. Often, I'll also play focus music while I'm working: it's usually just white noise pomodoros.

**19. What lessons did you take away from your previous story, “Hell and High Water”?**

**Yim:** I think if I wrote them all out, it would be a few thousand words, so I'll simplify my answer: I learned a lot about the expectations of players, what works well on the platform, what I can control and what I can't, and what resonates with who and what doesn't.

**20. Describe your new story in one quote or phrase (maybe from a famous person?).**

**Yim:** I think Hippocrates has a very relevant quote for this story: 

""Wherever the art of medicine is loved, there is also a love of humanity.""

**Thank you so much for your thoughtful answers! We're really excited to learn more about the new story and about you! Wishing you continued success**

**Yim:** Thank you for the interview, it was fun to share a bit about the behind the scenes of the story!",6,1751622938.0,RomanceClubDiscussion,1,1.0,False

My current stat is this, Arizona State University, Barrett, finance and econ major, 1 finance major (for 1 year), possible private equity intern soon this summer even though its late, joined 3 finance related clubs, 3.51 gpa. The 3.51 gpa wasnt because i was stupid, i just didnt know the path i wanted to take in college so i kinda didnt take classes seriously, most of the reasons for that gpa is cuz i was too lazy to get up, but i found the path i want to take now so with that and a 60k debt on my back, im pretty sure my 1st semester gpa for ut austin will be around 3.85-4.0. My gpa in highschool was 4.7/4.0 and act was 34 btw if anyone is doubting that i cant get my gpa to 3.85-4.0 in first semester. The reason i want to transfer is because of UT Austin being a well known semi-target to target school for these position. Top firms target sophomores, like right now im in summer entering junior year and im already seeing internships applications for senior year for the big 4 firm, so im probably not gonna get into the big 4 firm, but I dont mind a mid-sized firm. So is there a way to break into consulting, ib, or am while in junior year, specifically in second semester junior year since thats when my first ut austin gpa will be released. So im basically asking how good the networking, clubs, texas in general, everything and is it worth it to justify a 60k debt. And people who got internships at any of the position i mentioned or any high finance position in ur junior year, i would love it if you dmed me to have a coffee chat, it would be extemely helpful, thank you for your time.",1,1751622792.0,UTAustin,0,1.0,False
1lreu9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/trauma/comments/1lreu9b/living_and_sharing_flattrauma/,Living and sharing flat/Trauma,"
Hi, I’d like to share my story about sharing a flat with others.
I’ve been living abroad for 6 years now. For the last four years, I’ve been dealing with trauma – or rather, post-trauma. Thankfully, I’ve come out of it now.
But the last three years of my life were a nightmare I could never have imagined.

Let me be clear – I could sleep, nobody stole food from the fridge, and there wasn’t constant noise.
But still, my life after 2021 turned into hell.
It all started with a simple move...

I only wanted a flat closer to work. But I ended up living with people who – no joke – pretended to be friendly, but something felt off from day one.
There were 11 Airwick diffusers in the house. Eleven. The whole place was filled with chemical mist. I felt like I was living in a gas chamber.

I worked long shifts and came home late. My routine became this secret mission:
I had to wash my face and brush my teeth in the changingroom, eat a little porridge in secret before leaving, then come home, hold my breath, rush to my room, seal the door with tape and a towel, open the window, and try to sleep.
I did this for two years straight.

I tried everything: talking to them, reporting it to the landlord, even unplugging the diffusers manually.
Nothing worked.

Sometimes they toned it down for a week or two. But soon it was back to MAXIMUM intensity.
I had to give up the gym. Just being outside for two hours and coming home meant I couldn’t even sit on the sofa or drink my protein shake because I was choking on fake flower-scented death.

That woman clearly had major insecurities.
She was always on a diet, overweight, and possibly couldn’t stand seeing anyone cook healthy meals. So she turned the house into a giant scented battlefield – like a pet store on steroids. Diffusers in every socket. Everywhere.

These “insect flower” sprays? They contain ingredients that i read about are linked to infertility. I felt it physically — my throat, lungs, chest were burning.

Even basic tasks like eating breakfast or coming home from work felt like CIA undercover operations.
And then came COVID madness…

In 2022, during the Omicron wave, they told me to wear a mask at home and not eat breakfast because I had a fever.
I wasn’t allowed to leave my room.
I’m the kind of person who’s had anger issues in the past, but I wanted to keep calm. I was 30. I waited it out. After two years… they finally moved out.
But it got worse.

A new flatmate moved in — a lady: loud alcoholic and drug user. Another guy, who had always been suspiciously quiet, started hanging out with her.
He basically lived in his car, using it as a fridge. Rarely used the kitchen. But now, they became friends.

They spied on me constantly. If I tried to use the toilet in the morning, she’d knock like crazy, yelling that I was in ""her"" bathroom time.
I couldn’t even poop for 5 minutes in peace. And yet she had time to make coffee and smoke, leaving the door open so her smoke filled the house.
I was the only one cleaning. There was a list on the fridge that you had to sign in at what time you came home, but I was the only one who CLEAN the House!!!
Wtf? To have a schedule for coming home?
They would drink beer and whisper about me on my days off when I just wanted to cook or bake some bread.
They complained about me taking showers at the “wrong time” – like on a Sunday morning after a run or workout.
I thought that guy was on my side, but the moment she moved in, he turned on me.

This was my daily life. A war with air fresheners.
A war with people who had no sense of boundaries, empathy, or basic decency.

One time, I got WhatsApp messages telling me not to leave my room before 8 AM.
That I shouldn’t poop if it bothers someone. That I should change my diet if I “have to take a shit in the morning.”

Another message said I shouldn’t make breakfast, because “the girl doesn’t want to look at me.”
He even told me something like, “You’re obsessed with smells, man. At 30, people should be doing school, reading, developing. Not worrying about scent.”

I wanted to scream.
Who tells someone not to poop in a house they’re paying rent in? Who acts like a Neanderthal and then lectures about homo sapiens and personal growth? I showed these screenshots to the landlord and explained why I'm leaving. And I wasn’t alone. Another normal woman left the house a month before me  as she had enough of a whole situation too.

I just wanted to live like a normal European — make breakfast, go for a run, open a window, cook a meal, take a shower.
Now I live with people from Bangladesh and India.
No Airwick. No smoking. No alcohol. No addicts. No suspicious silent types.
I’m finally saving money and breathing clean air.
I know other people have bigger problems. But this was my personal hell.
And when I finally have my own place, I dream of something simple:

A sofa. My own plants. Essential oils. A window I can open. A kitchen I can use. A peaceful shower. Bread in the oven.

Life abroad isn’t easy. You often end up surrounded by people from the margins of society.

But I survived. I’ve talked to therapists. And now I want to share my story — maybe to laugh, maybe to warn.
But mostly to remind myself: that was real. I got through it.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1lrem00,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/1lrem00/partner_refuses_to_explore_sleep_apnea_treatment/,Partner refuses to explore sleep apnea treatment.,"My partner refuses to explore the new sleep apnea treatment. The one that works similar to a pacemaker and shocks the tongue back into position. This lack of exploration is  the last straw for me. I don't understand why he isn't going to the ends of the earth to find someone to improve his quality of life.

I've been with my partner for 10 years. He discovered he had sleep apnea when I noticed he stopped breathing on his sleep a few months into our relationship. He went to a sleep study and they diagnosed him with severe sleep apnea with more than 30 episodes and hour.
The CPAP doesn't work. He's currently ""existing"" if that's what you want to call it on mouth tape, coffee and napping during the day. It has got progressively worse as he's aged. He's now 45.
As harsh as this may sound, I'm thinking of leaving him. I cannot take the life we live anymore. We have 3 kids under 3. I do EVERYTHING. He doesn't work and barely has the energy to help look after the children. 
He can go from zero to 100 in temper at the most trivial things. We have a limited family life because he can't make it out the house before 3pm which doesn't work well when you have kids. 
I dread ever asking him to do something because he explodes into how tired he is and that I don't understand. 
I even had to put the nursery together myself while heavily pregnant and ask family for help in other areas because he's not physically able due to tiredness. 
If I ask him anything, it will probably take weeks before it's done and sometimes I need it there and then. 
He says I need to plan everything around him. Kids don't understand having to wait all day to go out. Then he gets angry when I ask him to come out earlier because he needs to sleep first.
I tried asking him to watch the kids so I can catch up on some sleep having done the night shift with the baby by myself every night since he was born despite being so ill returning from hospital. He said he couldn't do the night shift and me asking turned into a massive argument because he's tired and I don't understand.. And if I have the audacity to mention how tired I am, he responds with ""now you know half of what I'm feeling"". 
Our whole life revolves around him and his apnea. Socialising has diminished because he doesn't keep in contact with anyone due to his illness and if I want to have stay over, it turns into how is he going to get his rest etc. with people staying over. 
He takes out his frustration on me and I feel like I'm on the verge of collapsing. 
I understand sleep apnea because I've lived with it even if I don't have to the physical effects of it. I used to feel very sorry for him but I've now reached the point where I'm past caring because I feel alone doing life by myself with the kids. 
And refusing to explore new treatments is just the cherry. I can't continue like this and be whole for my children.",2,1751621759.0,SleepApnea,3,1.0,False
1lrelic,https://www.reddit.com/r/ahmedabad/comments/1lrelic/new_zealand_resident_here_wants_this_off_my_chest/,New Zealand resident here wants this off my chest.,"I did AMA few days ago as someone living in NZ. I was born and raised in Ahmedabad and been living in NZ since I was 17 (27 now). A lot of people expressed wanting to move here in my dms and a lot of people want to move overseas for better opportunities in general. I just want to share my piece of story. 

As I said, I moved here after high school in Ahmedabad (AG high school if you’re curious) when I came here I started my journey with decent university education and lived with my sister’s old friend who was living here. I was living with 9 people in 3 bedroom house. It was very cheap and I was just a student so felt like more comfortable option at the time. I worked part time in a cafe over the weekends for three years during my studies and helped some students with assignments for extra money. 

After 3 years I finished my studies and found nice job in sales. I worked my ass off in that job and moved out of flatting situation to live with 2 of my friends from college (both kiwis). I lived a dream for a while. In my fancy corporate job I didn’t get any opportunity of growth for a while due to my accent. Racism was all around me but a year into the job a miracle happened and we had huge restructure and a new boss stepped in. A beautiful white angel. She decided the supervision based on performance and not on ethnicity. I started getting every promotion became a project manager at the company. But greed had better plans. I quit the job to start my own business.

I was way too good, I had to start my own gig right? Things went great in beginning I was cloud 9. Six months down the line, I lost only project I had and literally had no source of income, it went so horribly bad that I didn’t have any rent money so had to live on streets. I spent two weeks sleeping on a sidewalk. I would go to public library to charge my phone, public beach bc they had showers, food banks so I can get some food. It was a horrible time that I don’t wish upon anyone. I spent most night just walking around bc it was -1 degree temperature and if I stay still, I’d start getting cold so rather than sleeping I’d walk back and forth to stay warm. My parents would call me every day and I’d always say I’m out for a walk bc I didn’t want them to know I’m living on a street. I didn’t want anyone to know I was living on a street.

So after months of approaching people to get my company some project I did end up getting decent project. And I still remember going for a meeting. I was gonna meet that person in a cafe so I went to the same public beach I go to and had a shower. I had $31 in my bank acc to my name so I went and got my nice deodorant which cost me $8 and I went to public library and asked the staff lady if she can look after my luggage for an hour (pretended to be fancy business man who’s in town for a day) and she agreed. Arrived at cafe 10 minutes early ordered coffee for him (already asked him his order via text). It was $5.5 for his coffee and I decided not order anything for myself (still broke). He came, sat and asked if I’m not having anything and told him nah “I just had a coffee before got here, I’ll stick to water lol” and meeting got me a project it has been yet and a half since whole thing and I have few projects running right now and everything is stable.

Now I live on my own in a tiny house but at least I have roof over my head and a decent lifestyle. And I still feel completely empty. If I die right now, no one would know until my body starts reeking. I wouldn’t have gone through any of it if I had my parents here and I could just move to their place. It’s extremely lonely and empty out here. So if you’re planning to move, do think all the circumstances. It’s not all rainbows and unicorns. My therapist has diagnosed me with severe depression and has asked me to take break from work but I can’t afford it. I literally don’t have single person around me except clients and employees. And I know some migrants live wonderful life here but you only know that bc they’re only ones who bother posting on socials. Most of us are struggling.

For me, my only way out is a decent understanding partner. I have told my parents I’m happy with arrange marriage (which apparently surprised them) but I need to get out of this rabbit hole and can’t do it alone so hopefully one day I’ll have family and something to live for. I can’t bother with dating I’m too old for it. But to anyone and everyone that thinks grass is greener on other side, it really isn’t. Love your family and be grateful.

And also, to anyone going through rough time, I hope things get better for you. Mental health is a bitch!",10,1751621708.0,ahmedabad,14,0.92,False
1lrel2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/PornAddiction/comments/1lrel2c/girlfriend_made_a_joke_that_triggered_me/,Girlfriend made a joke that triggered me,"Long story short she cracked a joke about a coffee chain, black rock, and called it black cock coffee. I thought I misheard her and she tried to deny she said black cock and then eventually came around and said something to the effect of “yeah I was just making a dirty joke”. She’s never joked like that before so I was a little shocked. 

I immediately threw back something I knew would upset her as a knee jerk reaction and I’m disappointed in myself for reacting that way. All she knows about my porn addiction is that I have one. I am a white male in my twenties and porn has destroyed my self esteem, especially when it comes to black men. I consumed a lot of cuckold and other related fetish porn and it has warped my sense of reality so much that immediately upon realizing what she said I started to think she would be happier, more satisfied with a black man and that she secretly wants that, all because of her replacing one word with another. 

I know it’s not normal to react this way and to immediately fire back with something just to piss her off (it did). I shut down and didn’t want to talk anymore and behaved in a cold and distant way on the phone up until we hung up, even when she was crying saying “I don’t know what I did wrong”. I didn’t care, I wanted to shut down and stop talking about what happened. I never treat her like that but in my head I was jealous and insecure and lashing out because of how I was feeling. 

I really don’t want to tell her any specifics about my porn addiction. How do I communicate that her little joke made me feel so bad inside? I was flooded with insecurity and other complex emotions immediately. I feel any communication about the joke other than I do not like it would make me look weak. 
Yes, porn brain, I probably have a terrible case. Along with insecurities popping up, I visualized her in a porn scene like way with a black man, it made me want to die.

Because of WFH i could just take my laptop and go home to my parents and spend more time with them for days. Instead of commuting i enjoyed morning coffee with my parents, enjoyed little moments together and after finishing my work we just stayed together in the garden as we have a nice little tree house in the garden.

I am so glad that i could spend more time with her, last week without any sign she got sick very fast right in the morning before starting my work. I was with her in her last moments and held her in my arms as her breath became heavier and heavier. The ambulance came fast, but she died the next day.

1lrejgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/vibecoding/comments/1lrejgs/my_honest_take_after_months_in_the_trenches_of/,My honest take after months in the Trenches of using multiple ais into my workflow,"TLDR,

If you would told me a year ago I would be having “conversations” with bots about my code, I would have laughed. Now, AI review agents are part of my daily workflow and honestly, it’s been a weird, surprisingly helpful ride. Here’s what it’s really like using AI for code reviews, no sugarcoating.



**How It Feels to Get a Review From an AI**

Picture this: you push up a PR, grab a coffee, and come back to… a wall of comments from an AI assistant. Some are dead on ( Unused variable here! or This could be simplified with a map), and you think, Okay, that’s actually handy. Others are hilariously off ( Consider renaming this loop counter to ‘banana’ for clarity. Uh, thanks, I guess?).

At first, I was skeptical. But after a few weeks, I started noticing my PRs were getting merged faster, and my teammates were spending less time nitpicking style or catching obvious bugs. The AI was handling the grunt work, freeing up humans for the meaty discussions. Literally i have used multiple ais to make my workflow faster and faster day by day like claude, copilot and chatgpt, with these old and classic ais i am also trying new one's like warp, ninja and blackbox, warp is very good and the other two are decent.



The Good, the Bad, and the What the… about these ais?

**What is awesome:**  

* It never gets tired of pointing out typos and style mistakes.
* It’s surprisingly good at finding dead code and redundant logic, even in legacy files no one wants to touch.

**Where it falls flat:**  

* Deep business logic? Forget it. It can’t read your mind (or your product requirements).
* Project-specific conventions trip it up a lot like that weird pattern your team adopted in 2019.
* Sometimes it’ll “fix” stuff that wasn’t broken, or nitpick in ways no human reviewer would.



Real Talk: What Surprised Me

* The AI sometimes catches subtle bugs I’d totally miss, especially late at night.
* It’s not a silver bullet. I still need real people to sanitycheck big changes and talk through tricky logic.
* The quality of suggestions depends a lot on how clear your code and PR descriptions are. The more context you give, the smarter it gets.



Honestly i would like to say treat the AI as your ultra diligent intern, great at grunt work, occasionally brilliant, but still needs oversight.

 If you’re drowning in PRs or have a lot of junior devs, it’s a lifesaver. Just don’t expect it to understand your inside jokes or company lore.

disclaimer: throwaway for anonymity

First day of a new job, working remotely. Everything is going fine, setting up my access, accounts, laptop, the usual. I set up my Teams account, launch the app, check the calendar, accept all the intro and regular meetings in the next 2 weeks.

I continue going through the first day checklist and decide to take a break after about 2 hours. I stretch a bit and go make myself a coffee. About ten minutes later, my phone rings, unknown number. ""Hi, this is X from Corp HR! I'm calling because Y, your manager, can't see you online on Teams. Can you go log in and contact him?"".

Needless to say, I was confused. I had never heard of Y until then. I was told someone else would be my manager. And he's contacting HR because of my Teams status? Not to mention I had accepted meeting invitations *he* sent me and had previous activity in the app, which you can see in there!

How does contacting HR first make any sense? Wouldn't it be a much more sane course of action to send me a message saying ""Hey, I'm Y, there was a change in teams, so I'll be your new manager. Is everything going ok with your setup?"" Had he done that, I would have replied immediately, as I had the app on my phone as well.

  
It's like 50 shades of red flags. I nearly quit on the spot.

Okay, real talk: Who doesn’t want to feel like they’ve hit the rewind button on life? I mean, if there’s a magic potion for youthful skin and boundless energy, I’m all ears! Well, guess what? I recently discovered this *anti-aging* superfood powder that uses ancient herbs, and let me tell you, my skin and energy levels are feeling downright *spring chicken* lately. 🐣✨ 

You’re probably rolling your eyes thinking, “Not another miracle in a jar!” But hold on, hear me out. When I first came across this powder, I was skeptical. However, I had nothing to lose apart from a few stubborn wrinkles and a consistent 3 PM energy crash. 

Here’s what I found out after a few weeks of using it:

- **Ancient Herbs FTW:** Seriously, these herbs have been used for centuries! Who knew our ancestors had it all figured out while we’ve just been guzzling coffee and slathering on creams? 🤷‍♀️

I'm Hemant, Founder of  Moksha Botanicals, and yes, this is a promotional post. I've been lurking here long enough to know how you feel about brands pushing products, but I genuinely believe this addresses something many of you are struggling with silently.

At Moksha Botanicals, we became obsessed with one specific problem: why so many men are walking around feeling like shadows of their former selves.

If you're like most guys in their 30s, 40s, or beyond, you probably recognize these frustrations:

**The 3 PM crash that hits like a brick wall** \- You used to power through entire days, now you're reaching for your third coffee just to feel human.

**Workouts that feel like you're moving through quicksand** \- The same weights that used to feel light now seem impossibly heavy, and your motivation has disappeared.

**Bedroom performance that's become a source of anxiety** \- What used to be effortless now requires planning, timing, and frankly, a lot of hope.

**The constant mental fog** \- You're going through the motions, but that sharp, confident version of yourself feels like a distant memory.

**Sleep that doesn't actually restore you** \- Eight hours in bed, but you wake up feeling like you never slept at all.

Here's what nobody talks about: this isn't just ""getting older."" Your testosterone levels have been quietly declining since your late twenties, and modern life is accelerating that decline.

We developed MoolPrana to address this at the root level. It's an Ayurvedic blend designed to naturally support your Root Chakra (Mooladhara) - what modern science calls your endocrine system.

What's actually in it:

* **Horny Goat Weed (Epimedium):** Clinically studied for erectile function and blood flow
* **Maca Root:** Peruvian powerhouse for energy, stamina, and hormonal balance
* **Niacin (Vitamin B3)**: Essential for energy production and vascular health

  
**What users are actually experiencing:**

* Energy that lasts from morning until evening without crashes
* Workouts where you feel like you're 25 again
* Confidence returning to intimate moments
* Mental clarity that makes you feel sharp and focused
* Recovery that actually happens overnight



One customer (entrepreneur, 42) wrote: ""The change in my energy levels and mental clarity is so noticeable that I had to write about it. I feel more productive than ever.""

Another (father of three, 38): ""Before, household tasks would drain me due to fatigue, but now I breeze through them with energy to spare.""

**The science is solid - we've included links to 20+ peer-reviewed studies on our product page covering everything from testosterone support to erectile function improvements.**

Here's what makes this different:

No synthetic hormones or sketchy ingredients

Based on 5,000-year-old Ayurvedic principles backed by modern research

Manufactured under strict FDA-registered, GMP-certified facilities

90 vegan capsules (45-day supply)

**Eco-friendly packaging (we've saved over 1,000 trees so far)**

P.S.: Yes, the name ""Horny Goat Weed"" makes us chuckle too. Ancient Chinese medicine wasn't subtle about naming things, but the research behind it is serious business.

1lree4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1lree4t/the_thing_in_her_skin/,The Thing In Her Skin,"The day Lila came back from the local summer camp, the sun was too bright. Jasper leaned against the porch railing, arms crossed. His mom, Elise, had been buzzing around all afternoon—cooking dinner, deep-cleaning the house, fluffing throw pillows like the governor was stopping by instead of a sleepy 13-year-old girl. He wasn’t sure why he was so tense. He missed her. That part was true. But something gnawed at him. Maybe it was the letter from the camp—formal, signed by someone he’d never heard of. Or maybe it was how no one answered Elise’s calls all week. No updates. No photos. Just a single message: *a van would drop her off at 6:00 p.m. sharp.*

 

And at 6:02, it arrived.

 

A long, dark green van with no markings. No music playing. Just the soft crunch of gravel beneath its tires. Jasper straightened as the side door slid open. There she was. Same strawberry-blonde hair. Same freckles. Same oversized hoodie she wore everywhere like armor. But something about the way she stepped out made his stomach twist. She moved… cautiously. Not tired. Not slow. Just… measured. Like she was learning the ground beneath her. She saw him. Smiled. And walked right past him. Straight through the front door. That was odd, he thought. Usually, when Lila was gone for more than even a few hours, she’d greet him with an excited hug.

The kitchen smelled like garlic bread and overcooked roast. Elise was all smiles, fluttering between the stove and the table, humming to herself like nothing in the world had ever gone wrong. Their father, Mark, sat at the head of the table, half-awake, half-hungover, already on his second beer even though it was barely past six.

Jasper sat across from Lila, watching her hands. She hadn’t said much since she walked in—just a quiet “Hi, Mom” and a nod to their dad. Her hoodie sleeves were tugged halfway over her fingers, like always. That part was the same. “So,” Elise chirped as she set down a steaming plate in front of her daughter, “how was camp, sweetheart?” Lila smiled. “It was really fun. I made lots of friends and we did crafts and hiking and swimming almost every day.” Jasper looked up. That was the right answer. The kind of thing their mom wanted to hear. But her smile was too wide. Too still. “That’s great, honey,” Elise said, already relieved. “Did you have a favorite part?”

Lila blinked, paused too long. “I liked the night hikes. The air smelled like… pine and metal.” Elise raised an eyebrow. “Metal?” “Yeah,” Lila said, her voice still cheerful. “It was sharp. You could taste it.” Mark chuckled from behind his beer. “Kids and their weird descriptions.” Jasper didn’t laugh.

 He glanced at her plate. She was halfway through her food already—just tearing through it like she hadn’t eaten in days. That wasn’t weird. Camp food probably sucked but then he noticed something that made his skin go cold. The carrots. Lila hated cooked carrots. She used to gag at the smell. She’d push them to the edge of her plate like they were poison. But tonight. They were gone. Not a single one left. “You ate the carrots?” Jasper said without thinking. Lila looked at him. Smiled. “Of course. I love carrots.” He stared at her. She didn’t blink.

 

After dinner, the house settled into its usual quiet. The kind that felt heavy in the walls. Mark disappeared to the garage with his beer, and Elise was in bed by nine, claiming she had an early shift in the morning. Jasper waited a while. Long enough for the house to feel still. Then he padded down the hall and knocked softly on Lila’s door.

“Hey,” he said. “Can I come in?”

“Yeah,” came her voice. Flat.

He stepped inside. The room looked the same. Posters still up. Blanket with the bunnies still folded at the end of her bed. Her camp duffel bag sat in the corner, untouched. She sat cross-legged on the mattress, arms folded tight around her middle, eyes fixed on the wall like there was something painted there only she could see. “You settling in okay?” he asked, trying to sound casual. “That ride back looked kinda sketchy.”

“It was fine.” Her voice was light, but distant. “They feed you weird cult food or something?” he joked, easing onto the edge of her bed. She blinked. “No.” A pause. “It wasn’t that kind of camp.” Jasper let out a breathy laugh, but it died in his throat. Her tone had been too… intentional. Like she was correcting him.

“Right,” he said. “Just, you know… you’re acting kind of—”

“Tired,” she interrupted.

“Huh?”

“That’s what you were going to say, right?” she asked, finally turning to him with that same unmoving smile. “I’m acting tired.”

Jasper swallowed. “Yeah. Sure. Tired.”

“I just want to be alone for a while.”

“Yeah. No, I get it.” He stood, suddenly unsure where to put his hands. “Okay. Well, I’m right across the hall if you want to talk or whatever.” She didn’t answer. Just turned back toward the wall. Jasper hesitated, then slowly backed out of the room, pulling the door closed behind him with a soft *click*. As he walked away, he realized something. She never asked him about *his* week. She always used to.

 

Jasper lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. The house had gone quiet hours ago. No pipes creaking. No TV murmuring from the living room. Just the soft ticking of the vent and the steady hum of silence. He kept replaying their conversation. Or lack of one. The way she spoke. The way she didn’t ask anything about him. The way she smiled too long and said she loved carrots. *She just got home,* he told himself. *Give her time.* He flipped onto his side and closed his eyes.

 

A whisper.

 

“You locked the door.” His eyes snapped open. Lila’s voice. But not quite. Too calm. Too smooth. Like someone trying out the words for the first time.

 

*Scratch… scratch…*

 

Fingernails, just beneath the doorknob. “That’s not very nice.” His chest went still. Silence. Then—another voice. Soft. Warm. Familiar.

 

“Honey? Are you okay?”

It was mother. But she was asleep. He *knew* she was asleep. The voice was too clean. Too exact. A copy. He didn’t move. Just stared at the door. Then he heard it.

 

*Thud…*

 

Not outside the door. Not in the hall.

 

*Thud…*

 

From above.

 

*Thud… thud… thud…*

 

Footsteps. Heavy. Slow. Crawling across the ceiling. And they weren’t moving away. They were coming toward him. Closer. *Closer*. Straight through the ceiling. He clenched the blanket tight in his fists. *Don’t breathe.* The footsteps stopped. **Right above his bed.**

 

 

The next morning, sunlight poured in through Jasper’s bedroom window like nothing had happened. Like the footsteps on the ceiling hadn’t happened. Like the whisper at his door was just a dream. But he knew better. He hadn’t slept. Not a second.

Elise was already moving through the kitchen in her usual whirlwind—pouring coffee, grabbing a granola bar, her phone wedged between her shoulder and ear as she juggled a tote bag and car keys. “Mom,” Jasper said, stepping into the kitchen, still in yesterday’s hoodie. She glanced up, smiling with that tired brightness she always wore before work. “Hey, sweetie. You want coffee? There’s still some left.” “No—Mom, listen. Something happened last night.” Her phone buzzed. She silenced it without looking. “Can it wait until tonight? I’m already running behind—someone called in and they’re making me—”

“It’s about Lila.” That made her pause. Barely. “What about her?” “She… I think she was outside my room. Whispering. But—” “Jasper,” she said gently, stuffing the granola bar in her bag, “she just got back. She’s probably adjusting. You know how your imagination gets when you’re overtired.” “I’m not imagining things,” he snapped. Elise’s smile tightened just a little. “I know. But she’s your sister. Just... be patient with her, okay?” She leaned in to kiss his forehead, missed, and kissed his cheek instead. “Love you. I’ll be home late.” And then she was gone. The door slammed shut behind her.

The house was quiet again. Father wouldn’t be home until late. Saturdays meant double shifts followed by the bar. That left just him. And Lila. Upstairs, the floor creaked. She was awake. Jasper hovered in the hallway outside the kitchen, pouring cereal into a bowl he wasn’t hungry for. The house was quiet again, except for the occasional creak above his head. Lila’s room. He sat at the table, aimlessly stirring the cereal until it went soggy.

Footsteps on the stairs. Slow. Steady. She came around the corner in that same oversized hoodie, her hair hanging loose around her shoulders. Her eyes looked puffy—not from crying, but like she hadn’t blinked in forever.

“Morning,” she said. Jasper looked up. “Hey.” Lila stood across from him and pulled a chair out too slowly, like she was counting the motions in her head. “Did you sleep okay?” she asked “Yeah,” Jasper lied. “Good.” Silence settled between them. “I missed you,” she said next. Jasper blinked. She never just said things like that. Lila usually joked, teased, shoved his arm and made fun of his music taste. *“I missed you”* wasn’t her style. “Yeah?” he asked. She nodded. “I thought about you. At camp. I remembered your favorite cereal.” He glanced at the soggy mess in his bowl. “You did?” “It’s the blue box. With the bear on it.” She said. His heart picked up slightly. That *was* right. But she said it like she was reciting trivia. Then she smiled. “You still like cartoons, right? You used to watch that one with the frog. The talking frog that plays the banjo.”

Jasper narrowed his eyes. “I haven’t watched that since I was eight.”

Lila blinked. “Oh,” she said. “Right. I forgot.” She looked down at her hands. Fiddled with her fingers, too mechanically. Then she looked back up and smiled again. “We should play a game today. Just us. Like old times.” Her voice was sweet. Like honey spread too thick over something rotten. Jasper nodded slowly, even as his stomach churned. “Yeah. Maybe later.” She tilted her head, still smiling. “Okay,” she said. “Later’s fine. You’re not going anywhere.”

 

The sound of the shower kicked on upstairs. Jasper stood in the middle of the living room for a minute, listening to the pipes creak through the walls. He couldn’t stop thinking about the noises on his bedroom ceiling. He shook it off and flopped onto the couch, flipping through channels with the remote. Static. A game show. Some cartoon. He stopped on a local news station. The headline at the bottom of the screen made him sit up.

 

*“Mother Pleads for Answers After Son Doesn’t Return From Local Summer Camp”*

 

A photo of a boy—maybe fourteen, brown skin, messy curls, soft smile—flashed across the screen. The anchor’s voice was calm, but beneath it, the footage showed a woman outside a building, shouting at the cameras, tears streaking her face. “Kaleb Morris was last seen three weeks ago during a morning hike with fellow campers. According to reports, the boy vanished without explanation, prompting a wide search by park rangers and local authorities. The camp issued a brief statement expressing their sympathies but offered no comment on what may have happened.”

Jasper’s heart hammered in his chest. Three weeks ago. That was around the time Lila left*.* The camera cut back to the crying woman—Angie Morris, the caption said. Her voice cracked as she begged anyone with information to come forward. “Someone knows what happened to my son,” she shouted, gripping a faded photo of Kaleb. “Someone saw something. These people, these counselors—they’re lying. You don’t just lose a child out in the woods like that!”

The screen faded to the anchor again. “Kaleb Morris remains missing, with no new leads at this time. Authorities encourage anyone with information to contact Duskfield PD.”

Jasper stared at the screen. His mouth felt dry. The same camp. The same timeline. Upstairs, the water stopped. Lila was done showering. He grabbed his phone off the couch. Opened his browser. Typed “Kaleb Morris Duskfield” and clicked through a few links until he found a local page with contact info for Angie. A number. A note: *Tips or support welcome.* His hands shook as he opened a text.

***Hi, I know this is random, but my sister was at that same camp at the same time Kaleb disappeared. I think something’s wrong.***

He hovered his thumb over “Send.”

 

“Who are you talking to?”

Jasper flinched. Lila stood in the doorway, hair damp, hoodie back on. She was smiling. But her eyes weren’t smiling. He locked his phone without thinking. “No one,” he said quickly. Her smile didn’t move. “It’s rude to lie to family,” Lila said softly, the fridge door hanging open behind her. Jasper didn’t respond. She turned her back, started pulling things from the fridge—leftover roast, a slice of bread, a peeled carrot from the crisper drawer. He watched her carefully. Her movements were slower than normal. Too intentional. She wasn’t humming like she used to. No sarcastic quips. No snarky commentary. Just silence. He slid his phone from his pocket beneath the coffee table. The message still sat on the screen. Lila turned on the microwave. The hum filled the space between them. Jasper’s thumb hovered for just a second.

*Send.*

The message disappeared. He dropped the phone onto his lap and leaned back, trying to breathe like nothing had happened. Lila placed the food on a plate—she didn’t microwave the roast long enough; it was still cold in the middle—and walked past him to the couch. She sat beside him, way too close. Took a bite of the carrot. “I’m glad we’re spending more time together,” she said. Jasper didn’t answer. He stared straight ahead at the muted TV screen, heart pounding, waiting— waiting for that little buzz in his pocket. The TV screen was still on— mute, flickering through commercials.

In the glossy reflection of the TV screen, Jasper could see himself sitting on the couch. And beside him—

It wasn’t Lila.

The thing in her place was too tall. Too thin. Its head tilted at an angle no neck should bend. Its mouth stretched too wide, packed with too many teeth. And its eyes—black, endless voids—were staring directly at him, smiling.

But real-life Lila was still chewing. Still calm. Looking down at her plate.

He blinked. Once.  
Twice.

The thing didn’t move. Didn’t blink. Didn’t breathe. It didn’t match her at all. The reflection was watching him. He swallowed hard, his throat dry and tight. Lila turned toward him, her voice soft as a lullaby. “What’s wrong?”

The reflection didn’t follow.

It kept staring.

And it was still smiling.",1,1751620897.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

1lrea4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lrea4y/my_friend_accused_me_of_hating_and_trying_to/,"My friend accused me of hating and trying to outcast her, so I cut her out of my life and now she’s saying in racist. AITAH?","I’m gonna try to summarize this as short as I can but it’s probably gonna be a long post so buckle in people.

For starters, I’m a 26F with a small group of friends that consists of five people (4 girls and 1 guy), including me. Recently about four weeks ago one of the girls in the group, jade 26F, had a birthday trip in Toronto and she invited the friend group to go with her and most of us said yes. 

Details about this trip: we were supposed in Toronto for a week and had two weeks to pack, save up money, clear our schedules, etc. I’d say it’s a pretty decent amount of time to do all. Not the perfect amount but decent for me. Jade would be the one driving us all and we all be staying at the same hotel (also we all live about four hours away from Toronto).

But one of the girls in the group, Kayla 24F, almost NEVER answers her phone (which is weird because sidenote I always see her on social media sharing posts with me constantly so sometimes I wonder if she’s just ignoring us or she has her notifications off). Which is why it’s difficult to make plans with her because the rest of the group lives about 40 to 50 minutes away from her while I live almost 10 minutes away from her apartment. Which is why whenever we have group hangouts I have have to go by to her house and let her know but there are times where she’s not home or she is home but she just doesn’t answer the door - leaving her roommate to play telephone for a while. 

And when Jade invited us all she texted us in the group chat and and we all said yes except for Kayla and because we really wanted her to come on the trip with us it was up to me to go to her apartment and invite her in person. So I drove over and when I knocked on her apartment door her roommate answered (as usual) and I asked if Kayla was home and she said Kayla wasn’t so I asked her roommate to either tell Kayla to answer her phone or her roommate can tell her herself about the trip invite. Her roommate is really nice and I like her a lot and she agreed immediately and we went our separate ways. 

A week pasts and me and the rest of the group hear nothing from Kayla. We’re thinking something is not right because she’s still sending us memes and videos on social media and posting pictures of herself getting coffee so we’re wondering if something’s up with her phone or whatever. I go back over to her apartment, her roommate answers, and this time Kayla is home and I asked if I could come in and talk with Kayla. Her roommate said sure and when I went inside and knocked on Kayla’s bedroom door, all I got was a grumpy “go away”. I called it out to her and told her it was me and it was complete silence. I figured she just wanted to nap or something so I left but as your roommate to remind her about the trip and just in case her roommate forgot I left a sticky note outside Kayla‘s bedroom.

Fast-forward to the day of the trip and we still heard nothing from Kayla. At this point the whole friend group had messaged her and messaged her roommate but her roommate said she was being grumpy and refusing to talk about the trip with her, completely shutting down the conversation if the trip or any of us were brought up. We figured that she just didn’t wanna go on the trip or couldn’t and was being grumpy about it now. And here’s the thing, Kayla is the type of person to act a certain way or say something specific to make you realize how she’s feeling because she doesn’t like saying how she feels so outrightly. So we all went on the trip, posted pictures, and just overall had a blast. But on the fourth day of our trip, I got a call from Kayla which was surprising since she never actually reaches out online. I answered and immediately was met with her yelling at me about how I was trying to ostracized her and how she knew that me and the rest of the people in the group never liked her. We were so confused but we didn’t want our trip being ruined by some angry btch who had nothing to do with her life so I hung up and enjoyed the rest of my week.

When I got back I was really tired from how much we did, but instead of getting to relax in my bed for a day, I was met with another angry phone call from Kayla in which now I actually listened to what she was saying and I felt even more confused. She was yelling at me, claiming that I didn’t even bother to reach out or fight for her when the day of the trip came and she didn’t come. She says that I never put any effort into trying to be with her when I was only 10 minutes away and honestly her whole rant had me wondering if she was mentally good or not and if she needed to get checked because every time we try to have a group hang out this btch is almost never there because she either never answers her phone or she’s never home or she never answers the door. I said this all to her but she kept using the same argument until I eventually snapped at her and yelled at her, telling her that there wasn’t any point in being friends with her if she can’t even hang out with her only few friends that put the most effort they can into hanging out with her but unfortunately they can’t because of her own selfish and lazy irresponsibility. I hung up and enjoyed my day sleeping in. 

But hours later when I woke up at a time I shouldn’t have, I was met with my face and my name being dragged through the mud with Kayla accusing me being racist to her and discriminating against her for her culture. For context: I am a brown chilena woman and she is a Very beautiful Jamaican woman. I don’t know where she got the idea of me being racist from, but now I have people yelling me and calling me a racist witch who is a lowlife when half these people probably have food crumbs stuck in their hair. I obviously replied to her posts with no words but screenshots of our texts where I told her every detail she would need to know for the trip, plus more messages of me checking up on her seeing if she was ok, all messages with no answers. Can’t even call it a conversation because she never responded to anything. I had a few people calling me afterwards asking if everything was okay and I told them it was fine but I also have some people calling me the asshole because she’s just having a rough time with her emotions and I’m making it worse. So, Reddit. Am I the asshole for defending myself against a liar? Also sorry if this looks messy or if there are any spelling/grammar mistakes, it’s three in the morning and I’m honestly just ranting.",0,1751620451.0,AITAH,6,0.5,False

And honestly? I’ve really enjoyed it. The freedom to do my own thing, not having to constantly think about someone else, no drama, no overthinking. I loved being able to hang out with whoever I wanted, explore, date casually, even try the no-strings-attached thing. It was fun. It worked for a time.

But lately, I’ve started craving something deeper.
Someone to share random thoughts with, talk about how my day went, or just vent to when things get overwhelming. I’ve been working hard toward my goals, but realizing there’s no one I can immediately call to celebrate even the small wins hit me harder than I expected.

So here I am, ready to put myself out there again. This time, with intention. I want to meet someone I actually vibe with. Someone I can build something real with, no pressure, just two people willing to get to know each other for who they truly are.

What I Bring to the Table:
I’m an ambitious woman with a lot going on, but I always make time for the people I care about. My love languages are quality time and physical touch. I love deep conversations that make me think, but I also value quiet moments because being able to enjoy silence with someone is intimacy, too.

I’m a big coffee drinker (the stronger, the better), but I’m also down for a Pale Pilsen on a chill night. I’m straightforward, emotionally honest, and I communicate clearly. I don’t play games. I know what I want and I don’t like wasting anyone’s time, especially mine.

Physically, people say I’m tall for a woman. I do like dressing up and carrying myself with confidence. I’ve been told I can hold a room, and I think that’s a fair take.

What I’m Looking For:
Someone who’s also ready to be intentional — not rushing into anything, but genuinely interested in seeing where it could go. I’d love to meet someone who knows how to have fun and doesn’t mind driving around for spontaneous road trips, late-night convos, or just lounging around doing nothing on slow days. 

You’ve hopefully got a stable career by now because we’re not getting any younger. You’re emotionally mature, goal-driven, and secure in who you are. You can lead when needed, but not in a controlling or overbearing way. Just a grounded, solid partner type.

Physically, no super specific type, but I do prefer a confident man who is taller than me (around 5’9” and up) just because it makes me feel extra safe. Age-wise, 29 and up works best.

Location-wise, someone based in Bulacan, Pampanga, Nueva Ecija or Tarlac would be ideal. If you’re from QC, that’s workable too.

If this sounds like you, send me a message. Let’s exchange photos right away to see if we like what we see, and take it from there.",6,1751619872.0,singleph,2,1.0,False

1lre3oh,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1lre3oh/dreaming_of_opening_a_dessert_cafe_rolled_ice/,Dreaming of opening a dessert cafe / rolled ice cream shop,"My hometown is actively working to attract more foot traffic in their downtown area. They host weekly gatherings with food trucks and live music, plus seasonal festivals. Turnout has been great, but the area so far has a nice restaurant, a bookstore that one of friends owns and operates, one coffee shop that's not so good, a pizza shop, a plant store, and about a dozen antique / clothing stores. The town lacks any unique dessert or treat shops — especially one that feels artisan or boutique  We're about 30-45 minutes from the nearby city where most competitors / partners are located). 

Here’s my rough concept:

- Made to order rolled ice cream
- Coffee & drinks
- Gourmet candies, hand-dipped chocolates, and flavored popcorns (I'm debating if it's better to partner with well-known shops from the city. Sharing profit vs buying wholesale)
- Small selection of pastries with vegan & gluten-free options (Our town has very few gluten free options. Also considering partnering with a local French bakery that has excellent pastries with vegan & GF options)
- Paintings & photography for sale on the walls from local artists

Of course the rolled ice cream and coffee drinks would be handled in-house, but am weighing the pros/cons of making the other sweets in-house vs. partnering with established local chocolatiers, popcorn shops, or bakeries nearby.

- If you’ve run or worked in a shop like this, what do you wish you’d done differently when deciding what to make in-house vs. source?

- Any red flags when partnering with other local shops for supply or profit sharing?

- Any must-do marketing tips when launching something like this in a smaller town?

- What kind of licenses, health permits, or equipment did you need to get when you made things like chocolates, pastries, or popcorns in-house — vs. if you’d sourced them from local partners? Anything surprising I should watch out for?

I’d love to hear from anyone who’s run a small café, ice cream shop, or specialty sweets store. I’d appreciate any advice, cautionary tales, or encouragement! Thanks in advance!

I came here today for a bit of inspiration....I tend to play pathfinder in burts, and currently I am in another one of those (ya know, those ""I played 40 hours in the last 7 days kinda bursts....sleep is optional). I am currently in act 4 with my Dhampir Warpriest Scythe Urgathoa Worshipping Lich.... and I kinda love it. I abandoned my Trickster Run around Drezen, not because of Trickster (that one is still high up my list), but because I chose Magus....and hated it. 

You see, I am the type of player that plays the game on Story difficulty because I don't want to spend my time micro managing everything. I just want to be like ""haha, scythe goes wooosh"". I spend 10-12 hours of my day at work, so I only get 1-2 hours to play during the week, and a few more on weekends if I have nothing else going on. So yeah....filthy casual. 

So far I finished 3 runs.   
\- My first one was Human-Ranger-Bardiche-Desna-Azata (of course with butterfly waifu).   
\- Second one was Human-Fighter-Demon (for some reason I picked Lamashtu...I didn't now jack back then). That one was fun.   
\- Third was Aasimar Iomedae Paladin Angel. Meh. I just had trouble keeping my Paladin Lawful...I was too ""good"". 

And now my Lich. I abandoned an Aeon run (basically ran out of free time, that was when we had those 60 hour weeks due to only 2 people of a team of 9 being at work for months...), I think that a hellknight build, but I am hot sure. And yeah, the trickster. Both patchs that I like. 

So yeah, while I still have a good 20-30 hours left on my Lich (or less since it's the first time I am giving crusade mode a real try and now learned about a certain mod that makes that take up way less time), I am already planning my next run so I don't sit in front of the character creator for 6 hours....

Basically I am torn between a new Trickster Run and a new Aeon run. Maaaaaybe Swarm, but I just...the 2 things I refuse to do in these games - for now - is to hurt Ember or Arue. Yes I know Ember is annyoing, but for some reason she triggers my ""must protect"" instinct...probably because I am an old fart.....and Arue...yes, my Lich made her evil, but still.....as long as she's having fun....

I am just a bit torn between the classes. I generally hate magic classes...I don't know why but they are never fun for me. I am more the type of ""slowly walk to enemy and hit with stick"". But always playing Fighter or Ranger gets old...even tho that is my prefferd playstyle. 

So yeah, since I don't need a build that could survive in core - hell knows my lich would get slaughtered by Dretches there - it doesn't really matter if they are optimal or not, but I am looking for a melee focused (I already have to walking CIWS in the form or Arue and Lann/Wendy, so no bows for me) build that would - at least thematically - work well with either Aeon or Trickster. I think the reason why I didn't like magos was also my weapon choice...Rapier since Callistria. I just really like heavy blades....yes I am weird, I know. 

There are just so many classes I have zero clue about....like...Trickster Skald? On paper sounds thematically valid, but I just would appreciate any input or advice from you guys, since you know more about pathfinder than I will ever know (I am too stupid to understand these systems...I still have no idea what half of my skills actually do....I just pick what I like the sound of). 

So yeah, sorry for my rambling....my 4th coffee in the office just kicked in and since our systems are down, I had some time. Thanks in advance for any advice. Have a good one! ",1,1751619452.0,Pathfinder_Kingmaker,10,1.0,False

3. Libido - I feel like that I can have sex forever but won't cum also I don't feel like that I need it at all. Often feeling more mechanical than with pleasure. 

I am thinking to reduce to 5mg or to add welbutrin.
Has anyone faced similar problems because it does bother me to not feel alive?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Witty Analysis: KuPS Kuopio vs. AC Oulu – A Finnish Feud with Finesse**  
Ah, the Veikkausliiga! Where the snow is cold, the coffee is stronger, and the soccer… well, let’s just say it’s *passionate*. Tonight’s clash between KuPS Kuopio and AC Oulu is a classic Finnish derby, pitting two clubs with storied regional rivalries against each other. But let’s cut through the frosty atmosphere and see who’s actually worth betting on.

---

### The Odds: A Tale of Two Teams

* **KuPS Kuopio (Favorite):** Decimal odds range from **1.8 to 1.83** (implied probability: **55.5–56.7%**).
* **AC Oulu (Underdog):** Decimal odds range from **3.95 to 4.35** (implied probability: **23.0–25.7%**).
* **Draw:** Decimal odds range from **3.55 to 3.95** (implied probability: **25.7–28.3%**).

**Key Markets:**

* **Spread:** KuPS is favored by -0.5 goals (odds: 1.8–1.91).
* **Over/Under:** 2.5–2.75 goals (Over: 1.68–1.85; Under: 1.8–2.1).

---

### The Math: Splitting the Difference

The underdog win rate in soccer is **41%**, but AC Oulu’s implied probability is only **23–25.7%**. That’s a **16–18% gap** in their favor—enough to make even a mathematically challenged Finn raise an eyebrow.

**Expected Value (EV) Calculation:**

* **AC Oulu’s EV** = (41% chance of winning \* 3.95) - 100% = **58.9%**.
* **KuPS EV** = (56.7% chance of winning \* 1.8) - 100% = **-3.2%**.
* **Draw EV** = (28.3% chance \* 3.95) - 100% = **13.1%**.

**Verdict:** AC Oulu is the **clear +EV play**, with the draw also offering decent value. KuPS is a trap bet.

---

### Team News & Tactical Tidbits

* **Injuries/Updates:** No major injuries reported for either team (as of latest data).
* **Form:** KuPS has been dominant this season, but AC Oulu’s home form is surprisingly resilient.
* **Tactical Angle:** KuPS prefers a possession-based game, while AC Oulu thrives on counterattacks. If the underdogs can exploit wide spaces, they could shock the favorites.

---

### The Verdict: Bet on the Underdog

**Best Bet:** **AC Oulu to win at 3.95 (25.7% implied probability)**.  
**Why?** The math screams value. At 41% actual win rate vs. 25.7% implied, AC Oulu is a **15% undervalued gem**. Plus, underdogs in Finnish leagues have a 41% win rate—right in line with the global average.

**Alternative Play:** **Over 2.5 goals** at 1.85 (54.1% implied). With KuPS’s attacking flair and AC Oulu’s leaky defense, a 3-2 thriller isn’t out of the question.

---

**Final Thought:**  
In a match where the underdog is priced like a longshot but statistically viable, the only logical move is to back the plucky locals. After all, in Finland, even the snow knows how to defy expectations.

*Place your bets wisely, and may the cold winds of Kuopio favor your wagers.* ❄️⚽

We sat down over coffee and he opened a single spreadsheet with thirty tabs—each building, each lease, each line item. Every morning he’d painstakingly sift through rows, update rent payments, and flag expirations… only to realize by midday that he’d overlooked a critical renewal or mis-typed a date. Watching him wrestle with formulas and color-coded cells, I felt the pain of every late fee and lost clause. That’s when the lightbulb went off: there had to be a better way than this manual spreadsheet slog.

  That spark led me to build an all-in-one lease management system. So far it includes:

* **Excel/CSV Import Wizard:** Seamlessly upload existing files, map fields, and validate entries
* **Expiry Alerts:** Automatic notifications 30/60/90 days before any lease ends
* **Tenant Portal:** Rent payments, announcements, and one-click maintenance requests
* **Real-Time Dashboard:** Clear view of payments, delinquencies, and occupancy rates
* **Automated Reminders:** Late-fee notices and renewal prompts sent without lifting a finger

I brought this MVP to life using AI tools—primarily the ChatGPT-04-mini-high model for rapid, clean coding and the Lovable AI platform for the web interface.

While I love being able to interact with customers, passionate coffee lovers, and see how they enjoy coffee… I feel like my skills and development aren’t expanding, and there’s nothing much to learn (from where I am, at least).

I’ve been reflecting on my career lately and I thought I would post it here. How do I… get unstuck?

I’ve been thinking of taking courses, joining workshops but I’m honestly not sure if it’s worth it. I do feel like I can learn a lot more.

It’s giving me an “impostor syndrome” and I hate it. While everyone is saying that “I make good coffee” I feel like it isn’t enough.

My goal is to open my own shop one day but with cafes from where I’m from sprouting up everywhere like mushrooms, I’m not sure if it’s viable as the market is getting *very* saturated.

Am I the only one feeling like this?",1,1751618376.0,barista,2,1.0,False

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation.

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me—an eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the technologically advanced city of Silicon Haven, where sleek skyscrapers touched the sky and holographic billboards painted the air with luminescent advertisements, a hidden oasis existed—a pocket of nature known as the Zen Garden.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live? 

Who knows....I do not. But these are indicidive of a future full of b movie plot garbage that are based on Wattpad tropes with no clear details and no plot to get into, so that sucks.",1,1751617840.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

Hey team! Let’s get real for a second. How many of you have felt that *sinking feeling* when you realize the world around you is basically upgrading at the speed of light? Like, one moment you're casually sipping your coffee, and the next, you hear about some genius using AI to churn out content like it’s no big deal. Does it just make you feel like you're stuck in dial-up mode? 😳

Well, I’m here to tell you—**it’s time to level up or risk being left in the digital dust!** And trust me, I’m not talking about becoming some AI whiz overnight. It’s all about what *smarter* moves we can make without feeling totally overwhelmed.

**Here’s why upskilling is an absolute must right now:**

- **Tech is progressing FAST**: AI isn’t just a phase. It’s like a freight train barreling down the track, and if you’re standing still, it’ll run right over you. 🚂💨
 
- **Job markets are shifting**: With companies looking for those “future-ready skills,” you want to make sure your resume looks like the hottest ticket in town. Nobody wants to be the last kid picked for the dodgeball team, right? 

- **More opportunities than ever before**: Upskilling gives you access to new projects, collaborations, and pathways that you probably didn’t even consider before. I mean, who wouldn’t want to be the go-to person for the coolest AI projects? 

Let’s break down how you can tackle this:

1. **Start Small**: You don’t need to enroll in a full-blown computer science degree (unless that’s your jam). Pick manageable online courses that fit your schedule. From basic coding to understanding machine learning, it’s all about the baby steps!

2. **Get Hands-On**: Engage with tools and platforms—don’t just read about them. Play around with software like **GPT-3** or **DALL-E** to see what they can do. Seriously, it’s like magic! 🎩✨

3. **Join Community Discussions**: Drum up those AI connections—be it through forums, subreddits (ahem), or even local meetups. Sharing experiences and tips is where the real learning happens.

4. **Stay Curious**: Allow your interests to guide you. If something pops up that intrigues you—whether it's AI ethics or content automation—chase that rabbit hole! You never know where it might lead. 🐇

5. **Use Resources**: Check out programs like [Imagine Education](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals) that provide structured learning paths around AI. It’s a solid way to crank up your skills while also having a bit of fun!

At the end of the day, upskilling isn’t about following the trend just because everyone else is doing it. It’s about harnessing these tools that can elevate your dreams and ideas. Who wants to be the dreamer stuck on the sidelines when you can be the one making waves in the AI revolution? 🌊

So, what’s your next move? Are you thinking of diving into a new skill? What are you most excited to learn? Let’s keep the convo rolling!",1,1751617499.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

I’ve been living in an LIHTC apartment complex for about five years now on a housing choice voucher. I’ve got to get out of this place though because the landlord is constantly sending the property manager in people’s homes including mine without giving notice and it’s become too much to tolerate. This is what they do… They send out a 24 Hour Notice for some type of annual thing like fire alarm inspections or something and then on the date that they’re supposed to be there you end up waiting around all day and they don’t show. And the next day. And the next day. Finally you’re just like, screw these people, they obviously aren’t coming and I’ve got to get on with my life. Or else if you were gone during the day you find that it’s just generally completely impossible to tell if they came or not since they refuse to leave a note on the door so you end up assuming that they have come. 

And then several days later they end up coming through when you either thought they had already come or you had figured that because they never came they must be rescheduling and the way you find out is that because you weren’t expecting them showing you left the house a mess or a bong sitting out on the coffee table and when you get back there’s a comply or quit notice on the door because they were snooping around inside pretending to have been doing the thing they gave notice for the prior week. And literally every single inspection they ever do happens like this and they’re just allowed to break the law because there’s absolutely no oversight or recourse for tenants. 

So that’s why I’m moving out. I need to switch to a place where they’re not constantly unethically policing their tenants using methods that violate California law.
