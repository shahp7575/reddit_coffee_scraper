I arrived at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station with great enthusiasm for the forthcoming research. As an assistant scientist, I was basically responsible for assisting in the telescope's data access and ensuring that the equipment was functioning properly. Our base resembled a small village built in the ice cap, with just fifty or so of us residing in heavily metal-clad buildings that were linked with tunnels. There was just no way of leaving in winter as the airplanes could not fly in such intense weather. All of this was known in advance, of course.

Rodney was among these astronomers. He was from Australia, tall, with a quick smile, and he loved strumming the guitar in the common room after dinner. He was also in charge of the big telescope outside, which he used to track stars in the night. He and I would sometime share shifts, sipping hot drinks while discussing matters of the universe. ""Just look at the data,"" he would say, his eyes falling on the screen. ""Just like looking into the past."" He had someone who was waiting for him back in Australia, and he was to marry this woman someday. Things looked well for him.

It all began with little things. Halfway into the first weeks of winter, people started reporting missing items from the lab, such as cleaning supplies and equipment. However, no one made a big fuss about it. People were too busy saying they forgot because of the long days. The nights were simply too dark, and it messed with our minds, making it difficult for us to sleep and making us short-tempered. Dr. Thompson, our only medical person, advised us in our last group meeting to keep an eye out for signs of stress. However, no one was talking about anything.

One night, I was with Rodney in the mess hall having stew. Paul, Rodney’s friend who is a mechanic, joined him at the table. Paul said, ""Hey, Rod, you look tired!"" Rodney rubbed his eyes and said, ""Yes, maybe I am. Been looking at screens too much."" Rodney tried to downplay the moment, but shaky hands accompanied Rodney’s attempt at taking a bite with his fork. I asked Rodney if he was tired, but Rodney dismissed the question with, ""Nah, I'm fine, just the usual cabin fever.""

The following day, however, came Rodney, but he was late for work, and his face looked quite pale in the glow of the fluorescent tubes. ""Something's wrong,"" he confided to me as we calibrated our work tools. ""My stomach hurts bad."" I immediately recommended he see the doctor, and he nodded before leaving the lab. Later, Dr. Thompson confided with a few members of the staff, for I overheard him say, ""Rodney has a bug, but really, it's not serious.""

Word got around in whispers. In the common room, a handful of people gathered – I, Paul, and Lisa, a biologist. ""What's happening to him?"" Lisa asked in a quiet voice. ""Doc says it's flu or something,"" Paul said, but his voice was ambiguous. We were all feeling the pressure of the walls, how they seemed to close in just a little more.

By morning, Rodney cried from the pain. I went to the clinic in a hurry. Rodney was lying in bed, rolling from the pain. ""Make it stop,"" Rodney cried to Dr. Thompson. The doctor gave him a shot to ease the pain. ""This will help,"" said Dr. Thompson. Rodney's breathing slowed down, and his body seemed to relax. ""Better?"" I asked. Rodney nodded slowly. ""Yeah. for now.""



His body felt cold on my touch.

One hour later, alarm bells rang. We quickly went to the clinic. Dr. Thompson was working hard, pushing on Rodney's chest. ""He's not breathing!"" Dr. Thompson yelled. Paul and I were stunned. Lisa was covering her mouth. After a long period, Dr. Thompson stopped. He had sweat on his forehead. ""He's dead."" The room was silent. Rodney was lying on his back, eyes open but empty.

The shock was felt by all. How could a healthy guy die that fast? Dr. Thompson suggested that it could be a rare disease. But apprehension began to set in. ""He was fine yesterday,"" Paul whispered to me in the hall. ""What if it's not natural?"" I had cramps. The base had methanol for cleaning equipment. You had to be careful using it, but anyone could get some from the storage.

The nights dragged on. We made a wooden box for Rodney's body using wooden planks we found in the area, hammering it together in the workshop. ""This feels wrong,"" Lisa said, still clutching the hammer. ""Like we're burying secrets."" They kept it in a cold shed, and the ice inside meticulously preserved everything. Nobody wanted to be in or around that shed.

Whispers began. In the mess hall, over cups of coffee, everyone discussed theories. ""Perhaps he ingested something bad by mistake,"" one of the engineers said. However, Paul shook his head again.

 

""Rod knew better, though. Rod was smart.""

""Or could someone have given it to him?""

She stopped, and the silence was heavy, as everyone at the table wondered who might do that to the young man.

We lived like family, but the isolation did bring grudges, and petty fights from weeks ago now seemed larger than life.

I lacked sleep. Every movement of the metal walls made me startled. Is someone walking outside the door where I slept? I secured my door for the very first time that night. One night, I heard steps that stopped somewhere. I felt nervous. “Who’s there?” I shouted. There was no answer. Then the steps disappeared.

Dr. Thompson called a meeting. ""We need to stay calm. Help will come in spring."" But his eyes looked tired, as if there was something behind them. I thought of the blood machine in the clinic that could test for poison and replied, ""Why not fix it sooner?"" to Dr. Thompson in private. Dr. Thompson frowned at me, his eyes flashing with anger, and said, ""Too busy saving him."" This cast a shadow in my mind: did he miss something?

One day, Paul took me aside. ""I have some news. I found Rodney's journal."" ""What did he write?"" I asked. ""He wrote about arguments he had with a couple of guys about work shifts."" We read the journal together in secret. There were mentions of his arguments with an electrician, a guy by the name of Greg. ""Greg's acting strange, hiding things around the place."" My skin crawled. Greg was a quiet guy, always in his room.

I questioned Greg when I saw him next in the lab. ""Did you fight with Rodney?"" I asked Greg directly. He looked at me like I had crazy eyes. ""What? No big deal. Just work stuff."" His hands fidgeted as he spoke. ""Don't accuse me,"" he snapped and walked out. I felt afraid; what if Greg was the killer? What if it was another person? We would be stuck with the killer.

Days went by in a blur. Food didn't taste right. Had someone been tampering with the food? I spied everyone when they ate. Lisa didn't eat much anymore. ""Can't trust food,"" she whispered. Paul offered the idea of pairs for safety reasons. ""Never alone,"" he said.

One night, the light flickered. The lights went dark, and people panicked. ""Stay put!"" Dr. Thompson shouted from somewhere in the darkness. In the darkness, I heard breathing close beside me. Who was near me? A person touched my arm, and I jumped back in alarm. ""I'm Paul."" The lights came back on, and I saw Greg on the other side of the room, tools in his hands. ""Fixed it,"" he said, but his smile seemed false.

Suspicion was a poison as potent as our methanol. Arguments broke out over nothing at all. ""You're hiding something!"" Lisa accused her cook at dinner. But he said he wasn't. Dr. Thompson attempted to intervene, but trust was at an end.

One night, I found a note stuck under my door: ""Stop asking questions."" I was shaking. Who wrote it? I showed it to Paul, and he said, ""We need to watch our backs.""

With time, the months went by, and the wait for rescue seemed to drag endlessly. We called out, and help was on the way, but not yet. The investigators would arrive with the planes, but until then, the menace was in every shadow, every face.

Finally, spring came. Planes took Rodney's body away. Later, we knew it was a methanol poisoning. Everyone, including us, was questioned by the authorities. Nobody confessed. The crime remained a mystery.

Even now, far removed from the ice, I wonder who did it. And if this person is roaming freely, who knows the horror of what happened on the ice?





# ""LOCKED IN"":

The assignment had been one I was looking forward to for months. The chance to work at the SANAE IV base in Antarctica meant pushing the limits of science and studying ice cores and climate patterns in one of the most remote locations in the world. Our team of nine—a group of scientists, engineers, doctors, and support staff—arrived by the light of the sun in early February. The base was perched atop a rocky outcrop, surrounded by the seemingly endless expanse of white, with the next source of civilization thousands of miles away. We all knew what the score was—we knew that come winter, we'd be marooned for months, depending on the team to keep each other sane and alive.

At first, everything was normal. Normal in that we were bringing in supplies, normal in that we were getting equipment ready, normal in that we ate meals in the common room. Johan, our lead mechanic, was an okay guy, seemed solid. Tall, quiet, always working on something with his tools at hand. Hummed old folk songs while he worked. Made it seem like there was more life in the room. Pieter, the engineer, was more outgoing. Made jokes. Helped distract from the grime. And me? I was in charge of collecting the data, spent hours in the lab.

But as the days grew shorter, other small things began to change. Johan had started to miss dinner more and more. He would sit by himself in the bunks, staring at the wall or mumbling to himself. I came into the kitchen one night, to make myself a cup of coffee, and caught him sharpening a knife that was longer than he would ever need. He looked up, smiled weirdly, and said, ""You never know when you'll need a sharp edge, Lukas.""

I made a joke out of it, thinking it was just cabin fever. ""Yeah, for cutting that tough seal meat we never eat,"" I said. His eyes, though, didn’t match the smile. They were flat, as if he were looking me over.

Pieter noticed it too. One evening, during a game of cards and while the wind was howling outside, Pieter leaned in and whispered, ""You know, Johan's been acting strange lately. I got a lecture from him for borrowing his wrench without permission. Says I invaded his space.""

I nodded, speaking softly. ""Give him time. Isolation can affect everyone in different ways.""

But it only got worse. A few weeks later, the doctor called another meeting. This time, she explained that Johan complained about headaches and sleeping difficulties. “He's stressed,” she said. “So are we all. Let’s keep an eye on one another.”

That night, I couldn't sleep. The base creaked and groaned as if it is alive, metal expanding and contracting in the cold. I listened intently from my bed, and it sounded like someone was making deliberate steps along the hall outside my room. The steps came to a deliberate stop right outside my doorway. I felt a racing heartbeat, but I pushed the thought aside, knowing how old buildings creaked and settled. The next morning, all was fine.

Then came the first actual incident. The incident involved Pieter and Johan, who were mechanically working on a snowmobile in the garage. I, meanwhile, was in the adjacent room when I heard them arguing loudly.

""You're doing it wrong!"" Johan exclaimed. ""Always messing with my tools!""

""Hey, calm down, man,"" Pieter said. ""I'm just tightening the bolt like you showed me.""

I heard a thud, and a grunt followed. I entered and saw Pieter lying on the floor, holding his arm, and blood was seeping through his sleeve. Johan was standing next to him, a wrench in his hand, breathing heavily.

""What happened?"" I demanded, helping Pieter up.

Johan dropped the wrench, looking pale. ""He slipped, hitting his arm on the edge.""

Pieter flinched but said nothing. ""Yeah, accident. No big deal.""

The doctor bandaged Pieter's cut, which was deep but not too bad. Later, the doctor called me aside. ""That was no accident, Lukas,"" she said. ""Pieter's told me Johan swung at him. Keep an eye on this.""

Fear started creeping in then. We are stuck here—with no flights out until spring, and no means of calling for immediate assistance other than radio check-ins to the mainland. Our daily reports to base command in South Africa, however, did not mention anything unusual. But Johan's behavior took a turn for the worse.

He started shadowing people around the base. I'd turn a corner, and there he was, lurking in the background watching me. One afternoon in the lab, I was by myself entering data when he came in through the doorway. ""What are you working on?"" he said, very casually.

""Just the usual ice samples,"" I said, attempting to act normally.

He walked closer, and his hand came into sight, holding a glass vial. ""You think you're smarter than me, don’t you? All you scientists, looking down on the mechanic.""

I took a step back. ""No one's looking down on anyone, Johan. We're a team.""

He smashed the vial on the floor, and the glass shattered. ""Team? You're all against me."" Then he walked out, and I was left to clean up the mess, my hands shaking.

That night, Pieter told me as well as a few others during a lull in the common room, ""He's been saying things. Threatening me, saying he'll hurt me unless I stay out of his way. And last night, he cornered Anna in the hall.""

Anna was our biologist, quiet and intent. ""He grabbed my arm. He said I was teasing him by paying no attention to him."" She shook her head. ""I pushed him away. He didn't let go until I yelled.""

We decided to confront him as a group the following day. Before we could do that, things got out of hand. It was late at night, and everyone was in their bunks. Then a scream was heard. It was Anna. I quickly jumped out of bed, grabbed a flashlight, and went running to find out where the scream was coming from.

Anna was pinned against the wall in the hall, with Johan leaning over her, resting his hand on her shoulder. ""You think you can walk away?"" Johan muttered menacingly.

""Get off her!"" I shouted, holding the intruder back.

He spun around and attacked me, his eyes crazy with anger. ""You! Always interfering."" He pushed me hard, and I fell to the floor. Then Pieter and the doctor came running, alerted by the noise.

""Johan, stop this,"" the doctor said firmly. ""You're not yourself. Let me help you.""

He laughed, his laugh low, his tone unsettling. ""Help? You want to lock me up like an animal."" He then attacked Pieter, fists flying. The two struggled, with Pieter covering himself as well as he could. Johan climbed on top of him, choking him. ""I'll end this right now!""

I grabbed a fire extinguisher hanging from the wall and swung it at Johan's back, not hard enough to kill him, just enough to stun him. He rolled over, gasping for breath. We pinned him down, and the doctor shot him with something from her medical bag.

Gasping for air, Pieter looked at me and said, ""He was going to kill me. I saw it in his eyes.""

We radioed command that night, telling them everything. They promised to send help as soon as the weather allowed, but storms rolled in for days. Johan was locked in his room, under guard, but we kept watch in front of the door. Every creak, we jumped. I sat in front of that door, in the dim light, thinking whether Johan had snapped in his cell, whether the isolation had snapped him, or whether it was going to snap us.

After that, Anna did not utter much, sticking close to the group. ""I keep thinking he’s listening,"" she said, looking at the door of his room. ""Planning something.""

Pieter nodded in agreement. ""We cannot trust him,"" Pieter said. ""What if he escapes?""

The days seemed to pass slowly. Johan would sometimes strike the door, yelling out accusations. ""You're all plotting against me! I'll make you pay!""

Sleeping became impossible. I would lie in bed and worry he would sneak out, tool in hand, going to get us one by one. The base felt smaller, like the walls were closing in on us.

Finally, after what seemed like forever, relief arrived in the form of a plane. A plane landed, officials took Johan in for evaluation. Johan went without a fight, but the look in his eyes as he gazed at me.

We finished the season, and nothing was ever the same again. Fear persisted because, in a place like that, nothing teaches you that what's feared most is not what happens outside but what happens to build inside, waiting to explode at its own timing.





# ""HAMMER"":

I arrived at my duty position at McMurdo Station on that October morning in 1996, mixing the dough in the galley to prepare the evening meal. This station was huge, the biggest station in Antarctica, with a population of hundreds in the summer months, but in the winter months, it was much less, just a small group like us. I worked as the assistant cook, with the head cook being a big man named Tom, always yelling and barking around orders, but in a place as remote as Antarctica, one tends to go with the flow. In the blizzards that closed the doors and us inside for weeks at a time, there was nowhere to run from each other.

I noticed, though, that Tom had been rather cranky lately. He was staying in a dorm with a few other mechanics, and he would often talk about useless things, like the lighting and people using his cards without asking for them. ""People around here think they own the place,"" he went on brandishing his mouthful of teeth and chewing away at the vegetables I was mincing. I kept agreeing with him, busily mincing the vegetables away.



The other cook, whose name was Ben, was handling the grills. Ben was new that season, hailing from some small town in Ohio, I think, and when he had nothing much to do, he would often sing to himself. We were all right with each other, though Tom was constantly nagging at him about something. He even went so far as to bark at him when Ben had his music too loud in the grill section. Ben, though, would only smile and turn it down.

""Who moved my hammer?"" I recall a day while assisting with the clean-up of the lunch hour, Tom pounded the pot down onto the counter. ""Ben, I needed it to hang my rack, so could you put it back where you originally saw it – in the drawer?"" replied Ben as he gazed up from the area he was scrubbing.

Tom's face turned red as he replied, ""Ask next time. This ain't your house.""

""Sorry, Tom. Won't happen again."" Ben shrugged.

I stepped between them. ""Easy, guys. Long day ahead. Let's focus on dinner – stew tonight.""

They stepped back, but the atmosphere was so charged, so to say, as before a storm. On that night, in the midst of the mealtimes, Tom once again complained at his brother Ben, ""Ben, you're burning the meat again, Pay Attention!""

“It's fine,” Ben said calmly. “Folks like it crispy.”

A mechanic, Carl, sitting at the counter, eating, laughed and said, ""Easy, Tom, lighten up. We're all in this ice box together.""

Tom glared at him, but said nothing. I was tired, so I climbed into my bunk after the cleanup. The generators provided a steady reminder that we were alone on this rock.

Next day, tensions simmered. In our meeting that morning, the station manager, a stern-looking woman named Rita, reminded us to get mental health check-ups. ""Isolation gets to everyone, talk if you need to."" Tom rolled his eyes. Then, in the galley, he confronted Ben as I continued peeling the potatoes. ""You think you're better than me? Always smiling as if nothing bothers you.""

Ben paused, holding the knife in his hand. ""What's really wrong, Tom? You've been acting strange for weeks.""

""None of your business,"" Tom said in reply, and stormed out, his tray in hand.

I dried my hands. ""He's stressed, Ben. Give him space.""

Ben nodded. ""Yeah, but it's wearing thin.""

That night, I couldn’t sleep, and I kept hearing the sounds of distant laughter from the rec room, but something seemed different. I went to get a drink, and I walked by the galley. I knew the light was on. I peeked in, and I saw that Tom was sharpening knives alone, very slowly, and he had his back to the door.

Days rolled by, and Tom remained withdrawn as ever, skipping his meals as we did. Ben talked to me during recess. ""Sometimes, he stares at me. Like, as if he is planning something.""

""Talk to Rita,"" I suggested.

Ben hesitates. ""Maybe. Don't want to stir trouble.""

On one occasion, the kitchen was busy preparing for a movie night where there would be popcorn and hot chocolate. Tom arrived quite late and his eyes looked bloodshot. He then asked, ""Where's my spot?"" because he saw Ben occupying his spot.

Ben shifted over. ""Here, take it.""

Tom pushed past him, grumbling to himself. Meanwhile, Ben went to get a pan, and Tom said, ""Quit touching my stuff!"" Tom took the hammer from the drawer, the one that was used for fixes.

Ben raised his hands. ""Calm down, Tom.""

I remained stationary, frozen in my position at the sink. ""Tom, put that down. We're friends here.""

However, Tom's face contorted. Tom then swung the hammer, the claws out, at Ben. The claws hit Ben's arm, tearing away the fabric and the skin. Ben cried out in pain and backed away.

""Stop!"" I exclaimed, stepping forward.

Tom became crazy-eyed again, swinging once more. This time, the hammer touched my shoulder, creating a scorching pain. Blood flowed. Ben clutched his wounds, with blood dripping on the floor.

Carl burst into the room in a hurry. He had heard the commotion. ""What the—?"" Carl asked Tom, tackling him.

Rita came quickly: ""Everyone back! Get the doc!""

We got Tom down. ""He pushed me too far,"" he whispered. He was panting heavily, no longer struggling.

Ben leaned against the counter, his face ashen. ""Why, Tom? What have I done?""

The doc stitched us up – Ben needed twenty stitches and staples in his arm, and I had five in my shoulder. It hurt like fire, but we made it through. Rita made herself marshal, and locked Tom in a storage hut with guards. ""No one leaves here until help arrives,"" she said.

Word got around fast. People were saying things in the hallways, locking doors at night. Was Tom cracking from the eternal darkness? Or was something else going on? I took care of my wound, but the pain was in the fear of it all. Anyone could crack in a place like this, and there was no escaping it.

A few days later, FBI agents showed up, and we all were questioned, our faces gravely inspected beneath our parkas. ""Tensions build in places like this,"" they said. Tom was flown to Hawaii to face his assault charges.

So we continued, but the galley felt haunted. I checked for shadows, listened for echoes of that swing. McMurdo is a big base, but isolation has a way of shrinking the world. I finished my tour, then got out. The chill follows, though, in quiet moments. I think: Who's next to break?",1,1770625342.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

So here’s the deal with us rich folks-we all look the other way when our partners cheat. 

I used to think that was ridiculous. 

Until Ryan’s little mistress showed up at my door. 

She stood there, all wide-eyed innocence, working up the nerve to speak. 

“Look, I know this is wrong, but Ryan says he loves me. And I love him too.” 

“I know how shameful this sounds, but it’s better for you, trust me. I know how things work in your world. Just divorce him, okay? I’ll make sure he gives you a generous settlement.” 

Then she actually bowed. Like, a full-on ninety-degree bow. 

I almost burst out laughing. 

“Sweetheart,” I asked. “Do you have ANY idea who Ryan is in this marriage?” 

“He’s not my husband.” 

“He’s MY kept man.” 

“Ryan tell you the house you’re living in, that Porsche you’re driving-all mine?” 

Frost just stood there with her mouth open, couldn’t say shit. 

All that “fighting for love” crap? Yeah, that disappeared real quick. 

“Guess not,” I said, messing with my coffee, acting all bored and whatever. 

“Look-1 divorce Ryan, everything he’s got, everything he gave you? I’m taking all that shit back. Still think you two are in some fairy tale?” 

When Ryan got home, girl’s face was fucking red from everything I said. 

He jumped in front of her real quick, looking at me like I’m the bad guy or something. 

I was like, “What the fuck is this?”

Chapter 1 

He grabbed Frost’s hand and goes: “She’s not like you people. Leave her alone.” 

My hand was shaking holding that cup. I felt like I was gonna puke. 

But whatever. I stared at him: “And what if I don’t leave her alone?” 

He looked over at the table behind me. 

I turned around. There’s this box full of pearls just sitting there. 

Being the golden child in a mega-rich family meant I always had hot guys around. Like, everywhere. 

Plus I was damn good at running shit, so I didn’t need some arranged marriage bullshit to save the company. 

Back then I was wild as hell. Had boy toys everywhere. 

Ryan was just one of them. 

When I first met him, he was still in college. Different from all those other guys who only wanted my money. 

Every single time, he’d obsess over whether I loved him. 

He’d make me soup after I came home from business dinners. 

He’d always kept chocolate on him for me since I’ve got low blood sugar. 

This one time I got in a car wreck. He went to church every single day for like a month, praying for me. 

Even got me this cross necklace, said he begged God to keep me safe. 

I looked at him, all exhausted and shit, and I was like: “Why are you doing all this?” 

Back then I wasn’t even paying him that much. 

He goes: “I love you. I just want you to be okay.” 

“And if you could love me back even a little? That’d be perfect.” 

I guess his whole act got to me. I dumped all the other guys and locked it down with him. 

Day we got married, he gave me this box of cheap-ass pearls. 

He said: “I’m not rich or anything, but I went diving for these myself. Each one’s like a piece of my heart.” 

“You picked me, so don’t screw me over. Every time you make me sad, I’m taking a pearl. When they’re gone, I’m

gone. For good.” 

I thought he was so genuine and adorable back then. To show him I cared too, I promised him I’d never make him 

sad. 

So all these years, that box stayed full. 

Not a single pearl missing. 

Ryan walked over and grabbed a handful of pearls from the box. 

The box that used to be packed? Suddenly down by a third. 

My face must’ve given it away-he thought he got to me. 

“You fucked up today. Think about what you did.” 

When they left, I sat on the couch staring at that stupid box. 

Those cheap-ass pearls looked like shit now, yellow and nasty-looking. 

Just like Ryan’s love. Totally rotten. 

Before he walked out, Ryan said: “Don’t be a bitch to young pretty girls just ’cause you’re old now.” 

Now that I think about it, the signs were all there. 

We hadn’t had sex in forever. 

I’m thirty-two-definitely at that age where I’ve got needs. 

But every time I saw that look on Ryan’s face, like he really didn’t want to, I figured he was just tired from work. Didn’t push it. 

ཁར་བ་ངོ 

Turns out he was saving all his energy for someone else. 

That girl really is young and hot. 

I looked at myself in the mirror. Thirty-something and still glowing, looking like I’m in my twenties. 

Everything about me screams money and class. Could go toe-to-toe with any actress on TV. 

Ryan really has shit taste. 

I called up my giri Sarah: “That hot actor you told me about? Hook me up.”

My hand was shaking holding that cup. I felt like I was gonna puke. 

But whatever. I stared at him: “And what if I don’t leave her alone?” 

He looked over at the table behind me. 

I turned around. There’s this box full of pearls just sitting there. 

Being the golden child in a mega-rich family meant I always had hot guys around. Like, everywhere. 

Plus I was damn good at running shit, so I didn’t need some arranged marriage bullshit to save the company. 

Back then I was wild as hell. Had boy toys everywhere. 

Ryan was just one of them. 

When I first met him, he was still in college. Different from all those other guys who only wanted my money. 

Every single time, he’d obsess over whether I loved him. 

He’d make me soup after I came home from business dinners. 

He’d always kept chocolate on him for me since I’ve got low blood sugar. 

This one time I got in a car wreck. He went to church every single day for like a month, praying for me. 

Even got me this cross necklace, said he begged God to keep me safe. 

I looked at him, all exhausted and shit, and I was like: “Why are you doing all this?” 

Back then I wasn’t even paying him that much. 

He goes: “I love you. I just want you to be okay.” 

“And if you could love me back even a little? That’d be perfect.” 

I guess his whole act got to me. I dumped all the other guys and locked it down with him. 

Day we got married, he gave me this box of cheap-ass pearls. 

He said: “I’m not rich or anything, but I went diving for these myself. Each one’s like a piece of my heart.” 

“You picked me, so don’t screw me over. Every time you make me sad, I’m taking a pearl. When they’re gone, I’m

gone. For good.” 

I thought he was so genuine and adorable back then. To show him I cared too, I promised him I’d never make him 

sad. 

So all these years, that box stayed full. 

Not a single pearl missing. 

Ryan walked over and grabbed a handful of pearls from the box. 

The box that used to be packed? Suddenly down by a third. 

My face must’ve given it away-he thought he got to me. 

“You fucked up today. Think about what you did.” 

When they left, I sat on the couch staring at that stupid box. 

Those cheap-ass pearls looked like shit now, yellow and nasty-looking. 

Just like Ryan’s love. Totally rotten. 

Before he walked out, Ryan said: “Don’t be a bitch to young pretty girls just ’cause you’re old now.” 

Now that I think about it, the signs were all there. 

We hadn’t had sex in forever. 

I’m thirty-two-definitely at that age where I’ve got needs. 

But every time I saw that look on Ryan’s face, like he really didn’t want to, I figured he was just tired from work. Didn’t push it. 

ཁར་བ་ངོ 

Turns out he was saving all his energy for someone else. 

That girl really is young and hot. 

I looked at myself in the mirror. Thirty-something and still glowing, looking like I’m in my twenties. 

Everything about me screams money and class. Could go toe-to-toe with any actress on TV. 

Ryan really has shit taste. 

I called up my giri Sarah: “That hot actor you told me about? Hook me up.”

Chapter 1 

So here’s the deal with us rich folks-we all look the other way when our partners cheat. 

I used to think that was ridiculous. 

Until Ryan’s little mistress showed up at my door. 

She stood there, all wide-eyed innocence, working up the nerve to speak. 

“Look, I know this is wrong, but Ryan says he loves me. And I love him too.” 

“I know how shameful this sounds, but it’s better for you, trust me. I know how things work in your world. Just divorce him, okay? I’ll make sure he gives you a generous settlement.” 

Then she actually bowed. Like, a full-on ninety-degree bow. 

I almost burst out laughing. 

“Sweetheart,” I asked. “Do you have ANY idea who Ryan is in this marriage?” 

“He’s not my husband.” 

“He’s MY kept man.” 

“Ryan tell you the house you’re living in, that Porsche you’re driving-all mine?” 

Frost just stood there with her mouth open, couldn’t say shit. 

All that “fighting for love” crap? Yeah, that disappeared real quick. 

“Guess not,” I said, messing with my coffee, acting all bored and whatever. 

“Look-1 divorce Ryan, everything he’s got, everything he gave you? I’m taking all that shit back. Still think you two are in some fairy tale?” 

When Ryan got home, girl’s face was fucking red from everything I said. 

He jumped in front of her real quick, looking at me like I’m the bad guy or something. 

I was like, “What the fuck is this?”

Based on the feedback I received, I'm shifting my business model from fixed gift boxes to customisable gift boxes.

1. You would choose a box size (small, medium, or large) and you get to choose gifts from a predefined list. The list includes candles, shower and bath products, hair products, consumables like coffee/tea/chocolate, among other things.

2. Don't see what you want on the list? You can bring your own gift to be put into the box.

3. The option of curated boxes still exists if you don't want to think about it too much.

4. Some products can be further customised (for example, custom stitching)

I want this to be a gift that people ACTUALLY use. As much as I love flowers, I feel like they're such a waste because they end up dying within a week.

Not dinner.
Not drinks.
Not another “nice place, good food” evening that blurs into the rest.

I’ve been noticing something lately — couples today spend time together, but rarely create together.

This Valentine’s, I’m hosting a small texture art experience in Indiranagar.
Not a typical workshop. More like a calm, low-pressure space where couples sit side by side, work with textures and colours, talk (or don’t), and leave with a canvas they made together.

No art background needed.
No awkward teaching.
Just hands, materials, soft music, coffee, and time.

📍 Venue: Indiranagar, 4th main road near metro station indiranagar , Bangalore
📅 Date: 14th February (Valentine’s Day)
⏰ Time: 5:00 – 7:30 PM
💰 Cost: ₹1599 per couple (all materials included)

Some couples talk while they work.
Some stay quiet.
Some laugh at how messy it gets.
All of them leave with something that feels… real.

I’m keeping it intentionally small because I don’t want it to feel commercial or crowded.

Posting this here because I’m genuinely curious:

Would you do something like this with your partner?

Or what would your ideal Valentine’s look like if it wasn’t performative?

I've gone pretty deep down the OpenClaw rabbithole over the last week, and I consider myself to be relatively tech-savvy but not as proficient as a lot of others in here.

However, I feel like I have worked out a few of the issues that OpenClaw has from some of the posts I am seeing here, so I thought I would share my insights as I think this still has the potential to be a game-changing addition to a lot of people's workflows. MODS - if you feel this is useful, please pin.

For reference, I am using this on a dedicated Mini PC I had spare that has 16GB of RAM and an N97. You can pick one of these up for around $200 (I am in the US), so if you are committed to making a play of OpenClaw for the long term it works out more cost effective than paying a monthly fee for a VPS. That said, if you are messing around with it, you can get a VPS that will be more than capable for around $20 a month. I am also using Windows on my machine, much to the chagrin of my more technically-minded peers. Ensure you have Python installed.

I hope you find this useful - happy Clawdbotting!

**API Recommendations** 

This is a big one that I see on here a lot, as this makes a big difference to the viability of your Clawdbot. Alex Finn over on YouTube has some good advice which I used, plus found a bunch of stuff on my own. He has a great analogy of Brain and Muscles. When you go to the gym, you have your main brain which drives the thought process of what you want to work on and achieve when you are working out, but you go to specific machines or do specific exercises to train specific muscles. You need to apply that thought process to your Clawdbot. Some APIs/models are designed for specific instances, so you need to use them appropriately.

As far as costs go, for me I spent $42 on Opus for setup, and now I am spending about $60 a month (as long as Nvidia keeps providing Kimi 2.5 for free), but this includes some optional costs such as ElevenLabs for voice notes and a standalone SIM for Signal.

***Setup:*** Claude Opus Not even close for anything else. It'll set you back \~$30-$50 in token costs, but I highly recommend that you manage all of your initial setup and do your onboarding with Opus. It will give your bot the most personality and it will set the tone for your entire experience using your Clawdbot after it's been set up.

***Ongoing General Use:*** Kimi 2.5 (especially via Nvidia) Once setup, switch to Kimi 2.5 for your day-to-day use, and have this become the ""brain"" once your Opus setup has been complete and you have everything configured. If you register for an API key with Nvidia it is currently free. Ride that pony while it lasts. Even without Nvidia, if you buy credits directly from Moonshot it's about 10% of the cost of Claude Sonnet.

***Heartbeat:*** If Nvidia revokes free use of Kimi 2.5, then use Claude Haiku for the heartbeat. Using Haiku turns this from $10-$20 a month to <$1 a month.

***Coding:*** Deepseek Coder v2 Great for coding tasks and very cost effective. I have a Claude Max subscription that I use inside Claude by itself so my coding use is limited, but I did use it to put together some quite cool stuff for a personal project and I was impressed with the results. For most people $20 a month would be more than enough.

***Voice Recognition:*** OpenAI Whisper There is a skill for this, and it works great for transcribing voice notes into text and actions. I use this fairly regularly and I'll spend around $3 this month.

***Image Generation:*** Gemini \\ Nano Banana Pro There is a skill for this, get an API key from Google and plug it in. Definitely the best image one out there from my experience. I'm on track to spend around $10 this month.

***Memory:*** [Supermemory.ai](http://Supermemory.ai) This is free and a great way to keep your structure and memory backed up and saved (I will get onto memory structure later).

***Email:*** Nylas This is free and allows me to connect to multiple email accounts across multiple platforms (Google and Microsoft 365) so they can all be managed by your Clawdbot.

***Web Search:*** Brave and Tavily These are both free. Brave is great for general searching and Tavily is great for more specific use cases like scraping contacts etc.

***Optional:*** ElevenLabs Text-To-Speech (TTS) This is punchy at $22 a month, but is great for converting my morning brief into a voice memo that I can listen to each morning while I am making my coffee (use case outlined below)

***Optional:*** Dedicated phone number for messaging I use Signal exclusively for my Clawdbot. I use WhatsApp for most other things, but I wanted a dedicated channel for my interactions with my Clawdbot. This costs me $2 a month with Sonetel.

-----------------------------------

***Tailscale*** 

Install Tailscale on the Clawdbot machine and your main computer. As mentioned earlier I am operating on Windows (gasp!) and you can use Remote Desktop via Tailscale, and you can also then use it to control your Clawdbot via the web interface on any other machine that you have Tailscale installed on. It also means you don't need to have any RDP ports open on the server for Remote Desktop which is a ""nice to have"" for security.

-----------------------------------

***Onboarding*** 

This is one that I cannot stress enough - be as thorough as you can with your initial Clawdbot setup. You can give it a personality (this is where Opus shines) - don't be shy to have some fun and go into a lot of depth (mine is modelled after Ziggy from the 90's TV show Quantum Leap).

However, the biggest thing to do here is tell it as much about yourself as you can. Ask it to give you a very in-depth Q&A about yourself, your work habits, your personal habits, what you want to use it for, what things you are interested in, what content you watch, what foods you like, what sports you follow etc. - the better it knows you, the more helpful it will be.

Also, have a long think about what you want it to do for you. You need to think of AI agents as an extremely cheap source of labor who will work for 10c an hour to do basic tasks for you. The basic tasks are incredibly powerful when chained together into a work flow. Make sure that you explain very carefully to your Clawdbot all of the things that you want it to do for you as a part of your onboarding.

-----------------------------------

***Memory*** 

This is one that I see a lot of people complain about, that it forgets what you are talking about mid-sentence. Unlike ChatGPT which tells you it's out of context, Clawdbot will just automatically compact and forget as you go along - this can be hugely frustrating for the uninitiated.

Run this prompt - it sets you on the right path outside of the defaults to help with your memory management: Enable memory flush before compaction and session memory search in my Clawdbot config. Set compaction.memoryFlush.enabled to true and set memorySearch.experimental.sessionMemory to true with sources including both memory and sessions. Apply the config changes.

The best thing to do after you finish your onboarding, is setup a memory structure as a part of your heartbeat protocol, and also make sure you run /compact before you give it any workflow examples or agent setups. For example, before you explain to it how you want it to check your emails and you spend a bunch of time typing out the instructions, run /compact beforehand so that it has clear memory context.

After each task that you setup for it, ask it to commit that to memory so that it doesn't forget. Also make sure you ask it to check the memory before you start creating a new repetitive task so that it can include that in the context - as you will often find you chain basic repetitive things together.

I have a cron job setup for it once daily to check the memory and repeat back to me a summary of all the things it has saved for our workflows. If anything is not correct, tell it to correct what it needs to, and then repeat back the update. Once you get this and you are happy with it, make sure that it commits it to Supermemory (API I outlined above) and that way if anything goes askew on your local instance, you can restore from Supermemory.

Key takeaway here - make sure you /compact before any new task discussion, and make sure you tell it to commit things to memory and then repeat back what it has committed to make sure it's correct.

I run a manual backup once a week via Windows task scheduler to run a bat file that copies my .clawdbot folder into a backup folder on the PC. I also manually run Claude Desktop on the machine once a week to access the local filesystem (after my automated backup of my markdown, json, js and python scripts), and then audit my files, consolidate any duplicate markdown, and delete anything that was a one-time run or is not needed. I also have it create a prompt to send my Clawdbot with the consolidation summary. And as always, I ask my Clawdbot to repeat the memory back to me after the change so I know it's correct.

This is what my Heartbeat.md outputs:

[**HEARTBEAT.md**](http://HEARTBEAT.md) **- Periodic Tasks**

***Daily (Every Heartbeat)***

Review recent memories for important context

Automated (Every 6 Hours via Cron)

Supermemory backup runs automatically (12am, 6am, 12pm, 6pm PT)

***Weekly (Check on Mondays)***

Verify backup logs are clean

Review MEMORY.md for outdated info to archive

Store key decisions from past week in Supermemory

***Monthly***

Full memory audit: what's working, what's missing

Update TOOLS.md with any new API keys or services

Review Supermemory tags for consistency

***When Starting Work***

Search Supermemory for current project context

Load relevant memories into working context

Check for any action items or pending tasks

***When Ending Work***

Store key decisions made

Update project status in Supermemory

Note any blockers or next steps

***Context Management Rules***

Store important decisions immediately in Supermemory

Tag consistently: project-{name}, decision, action-item

Search Supermemory when context seems incomplete

Use MEMORY.md for quick reference, Supermemory for deep storage

-----------------------------------

***Cron Jobs and Sub-agents*** 

Depending on what you are asking it to do, don't expect cron jobs to run well, unless you are using them to spawn an agent for a specific task that you have already set up. I had to spend a lot of time with trial-and-error to make sure that these ran smoothly. I have a morning brief that it creates for me (see use case below) and when trying to put it together in the heartbeat cron job (which it defaults to) it would timeout and fail most of the time.

For any routine tasks, tell it to create a sub-agent to run the task, and then the heartbeat cron just spawns the sub-agent to run the job so that you don't have to worry about timeouts. That one took me a long while and frustration to work out.

-----------------------------------

***Security*** 

This is the elephant in the room for a lot of people, and is a risk, but one that can be mitigated reasonably well. Clawdbot has a built-in security scan you can run, but some of the key ones for me are:

Move your API keys to a .env file rather than the main config file

Rotate your keys every 30 days

Create a .gitignore file to stop sensitive files getting committed

Use input validation for your email scripts so it can't send without your approval

Rate limit your external API calls

Encrypt your memory files (I am using Windows EFS because I am on Windows)

Use Tailscale for remote access

----------------------------------- 

***Use Cases*** 

What do I use my Clawdbot for? Here are some ideas and examples for other people.

**Email Scanning:** It goes through my emails (6 accounts) every hour, filters out any marketing emails that are not important, or automated updates etc. and then summarizes the ones it thinks are important. It then drafts responses to those and sends it to me for approval, or has them saved in my Outlook drafts for anything I need to edit before sending.

**Task Monitoring:** I use a fantastic project management/task management tool called Dart ([www.dartai.com](http://www.dartai.com)) which I have connected into my Clawdbot via API. This tool has multiple Project task boards and sub-boards for all of the various things that I work on. My Clawdbot helps manage these for me and gives me a briefing every day of what tasks are slipping and what isn't. If I am waiting on someone else before I can finish something? Clawdbot will add a tag for it and ignore it in the next summary etc. - you can really customize what it needs to do. Do I have a task from my Email Scanner? Clawdbot recognizes that from the email, and suggests moving it to the appropriate board.

**Morning Brief:** This is where it really shines for me. It scans my Dart boards and gives me a summary of what tasks I have open. I have given it the schedule of what days I am where etc. so it will focus on those tasks for that day. It gives me local weather and a summary of news for things I am interested in, reminders for things on my calendar etc. and then sends it to me as a 3-5 minute audio file that I use ElevenLabs for. While I am making my morning coffee, my Clawdbot is getting me setup for the day.

**Link Scraping and CRM Management:** I use the Apify scraper API, and Pipedrive CRM. I can ask my Clawdbot to search for specific things (i.e. all wedding venues in Seattle), it will use the Brave Search API to go and find company leads, then use Apify scraper to get contact information, and put it into Pipedrive CRM. You can also then get it to plan and implement email campaigns and automate follow-up etc. - I have used this is the real world, and after a little trial-and-error it is working surprisingly well.

**Basic Coding:** If you want to vibecode an app or website, you're better off using a more purpose built tool. However, if you want it to do more basic stuff it does a pretty good job using DeepSeek to whip up prototypes or models etc. - I got it to build a basic personal health dashboard getting data from my Garmin Watch, my Withings Scales and my Oura Ring to create a consolidated dashboard for me of my overall health. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it put it together.

**Web Testing:** Using the browser integration skill, as well as having it build custom Python scripts using Playwright, it does a pretty good job of UI and website testing, and produces good reports afterwards to isolate issues. A great use of time while you are sleeping!

**Constant Improvement:** I have my Clawdbot scanning Moltbook, Moltcities, Reddit and other sites, referencing against my projects and making suggestions on how I can improve things twice a day.

1qzygsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dailymealideas_/comments/1qzygsj/door_dashadhd_and_prioritizing_time/,"Door Dash,ADHD and prioritizing time","I wonder how much she spends a week on Door Dash and fast food/coffee stops out of the house? She has referenced trying to lose baby weight, but I rarely see her exercising or eating well balanced meals. I don't want to say anything else about the weight gain and get kicked off, but if she is going to talk about it and claim she is going to the gym, then I have questions. All we ever see are wax pours and annoying squishies to show off her hobbit like stubby fingers and too long fake nails.  Also, I am getting a kick out of seeing the comments, she hasn't gotten around to deleting yet, confirming her behavior as a classic presentation of autism and/or ADHD. If it's true that her family refuses to recognize and treat MH issues, I feel bad for Jon. Does his family also refuses to acknowledge MH issues and seek treatment? Could his family help stage an intervention? I am wondering if perhaps she just doesn't have insurance to even go get help or get the right medications to help her. Did she carry health insurance when running the daycare? Or is she on Jon's plan? There has to be someway for her to get the help she needs so that poor baby Callen and any (Lord help us) future children don't grow up with a mom who is too interested in starting and stopping new hobbies than investing time in her children's school, sports, family time, and future. Maybe quit buying so much junk that you will never use again and start a college savings account for your kid so he can be a 1st generation college graduate (by the sounds of it) in her family. That is called being a grown up and responsible parent. The kids are the ones who play with toys. Read some books to expand your mind and learn about people and places outside of your Minnesota small town. Get involved and volunteer in your community if you aren't working The daycare anymore. Or maybe, just maybe get a real job and drop this tic tok trash account and become a good stewart of your community and for others in your area. But please, stop with these wax toys, weird asmr videos, mini surprise toy openings and hauls and poorly made cups that you touch with the same hands and fingers you just wiped your nose with.   


Your content these days reminds me of the little videos my son and his friends made in 2nd and 3rd grade after watching ""what's inside"" on you tube and learning about ASMR. Their videos were just shittier versions of what has been popular months before they finally made theirs. Your videos feel that same way; not original, not as good as the original and poorly filmed. Hannah, your years as a child are over. It's time to be the parent to the child you wanted. That means cleaning the house so it's safe and clean for your child, even when you feel so tired (likely from eating trash food from fast food Door Dash orders). That means being involved in his bedtime and bath time and snuggling him off to sleep,not pawning him off on Jon or your mom so you can go live and make your cheap cups online or show us how you pour wax over butter squishes. Use this time as a SAHM to get on the floor and play with your son. Use your money to get memberships to any zoos or indoor playgrounds or children's museums. I know Minnesota has them everywhere. There are also great programs all over the state that focus on play and music..they are for mom (or dad) and baby and the classes are called Musikgarten; they teach the kids songs, how to play different percussion instruments, how to keep beat, how to dance in different styles to a variety of cultural music. Every child I have taken to Musikgarten has loved this class just as much and mom and dad! It has several levels so you can go from baby until the end of pre-k. Money spent on these types of experiences will truly fill that void that you are filling right now with one expensive hobby after another that you can't do with you child or your husband. I think you will find so much fulfillment and joy by seeking out some of these ideas and investing your time and money in them. Otherwise, it sure seems like all your hobbies are more like self interests and nurture relationships with online followers who are not true friends and it doesn't leave enough time to bond and spend time and develop fun hobbies and traditions with your own husband and son, which is extremely sad in my opinion.   


I used to love this channel because she was so upbeat. But I can't watch her endlessly search for joy when she is too self involved to see if she were to just drop these useless hobbies, her family is right there waiting for her to bond and play with and truly bring joy into her life. Pour into them and prioritize them first....BEFORE you prioritize the wax squishes, glitter snot cups, mystery opening of the tiny toys. Someday, your 45 year old self won't regret that kind of choice! ",2,1770624218.0,dailymealideas_,0,1.0,False

1qzyg5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qzyg5o/hr_a_house_with_no_witnesses_an_original_story/,[HR] A House With No Witnesses - An Original Story,"At midnight, something unexpected happened.

I was woken up by a scream. The scream was so loud that I was sure it had woken up the whole neighborhood. The scream came from the living room in the house and I immediately sprung from the bed, rushing down the stairs. The horror I had felt once I reached the living room was indescribable. The lights were on and my sister, Julia, was frozen on her spot, her eyes were wide and her skin paled. Both of us stared at the body laying beside the coffee table. Our father, laying on his abdomen and motionless. Blood pooling on the carpet, my blood ran cold at the sight.

""I don't know what happened! I found him like this!""

My sister spoke while I was still standing there at the end of the stairs, frozen on the spot. Soon enough, the rest of our siblings and our mother came rushing down the stairs, they too had the same reaction as us. Except for our mother. She let out a cry of anguish once she saw her husband, laying in his own pool of blood.

The police were called a short minute later. My sister and my mother were questioned while I stayed back with my other two siblings. My little brother and sister. Both of them are twins, they were five yet they never speak. I stood at the edge of my bed, pondering about my father's death. It had been two days since his body was found by Julia and it had been two days since the house was left with this, cold atmosphere. Mother was worried about Julia, because she never returned from her trip to the grocery store today and it was already late.

I was suddenly snapped out of my thoughts when my door creaked open a little bit. I turned my head towards it and stood up. Footsteps can be heard from the hallway outside. Knowing those footsteps, it had to be the twins. My bedroom was on the second floor so I opened the door and followed along the hallway quietly until I reached the stairs. The twins were fast so I couldn't catch up to them. Once I reached the ground floor, I walked steadily through the living room. It was quiet, too quiet.

I could hear muffled noises and I knew something was wrong. I fastened my pace until I reached the kitchen. The basement door was left ajar. Furrowing my eyebrows, I went down the basement while carrying a metal pole, that was left standing beside the basement door, with me. I walked down the stairs until I reached the bottom. My eyes swept over the room and the first thing I saw, was my mother. Laying down on the floor with both her wrists and ankles tied. Putting the metal pole down, I kneeled in front of her. Fishing out a Swiss Army knife from my pocket, sliding it open, I brought it close to her, thought of freeing her because she's my mother. Her eyes were staring at me, wide with fear and unshed tears.

**Then I slit her throat.**

Blood pooled around her neck as her wide eyes, filled with terror, slide close. My sister laid not far from her, already dead. She was the first witness and my mother only knew the truth from her. So I had no choice but to kill her too. Then my head snapped towards the stairs, it was the twins. They stared at me with those clueless and blank eyes, then they quickly went up. I sighed and stood up, twirling the bloody knife in my hand. I went after them. This house has too many witnesses so I had to do it. My mother, my sister, my little siblings. And finally, there's You.  After all, You're a witness too.",1,1770624149.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1qzydlg,https://v.redd.it/hh5gusx9dfig1,"""Spreadsheet 666 A1 returns your childhood bedroom.""  A YouTuber reviewed my little IT horror game and said it captures the Night Vale aesthetic. I'm so excited!!","I'm Stefan! I've been working on a game called *I.T Never Ends* about doing it support in a supernatural office after the apocalypse, and a content creator just made a short walkthrough that compared the vibe to WTNV. This 100% has made my 2026 so far, since nightvale, reigns (and Severance) are like the absolutely most influential pieces of media inspiring the game, and to see somebody pick up on that organically is so cool. 

They described the gameplay as: *'The supernatural elements present themselves so matter-of-factly, sitting next to the mundanity of the coffee machine... reminiscent of the straightforward way we learn about a tiny town where creepy stuff is happening.'*

Hearing someone say they can 'almost hear Cecil describe' my haunted spreadsheets was the highlight of my dev journey so far. I thought you all might get a kick out of the comparison!

1qzycuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_lcpanicker/comments/1qzycuz/what_if_tomorrow_the_world_demands_a_goldbacked/,What If Tomorrow the World Demands a Gold-Backed Payment System for Global Trade?,"Hey r/economics (or r/conspiracy if you're feeling spicy), buckle up because I've got a brain worm that's been gnawing at me all week. Picture this: It's tomorrow morning, you wake up to your phone blowing up with notifications. CNN, Bloomberg, Fox, everyone's screaming about it. 

Global trade leaders from the US, China, Europe, and those sneaky BRICS nations have just dropped a bombshell: ""Screw fiat currencies, we're going back to gold-backed payments for international deals."" No more endless money printing, no more dollar dominance drama. Every oil barrel, every iPhone shipment, every soybean export? Priced and settled in digital gold or something shiny and tangible.

Sounds like a plot from a bad sci-fi novel, right? Or maybe the wet dream of every gold bug hoarding bars in their basement. But why the hell am I even thinking along these lines? Let me spill the tea on what sparked this rabbit hole, and then we'll dive into the ""what if"" chaos. Grab your coffee, this is gonna be a ride.

**Why I'm Obsessed with This Idea Right Now!**

I'm not some Wall Street wizard or a crypto bro with a Lambo. I'm just a regular dude who's been doomscrolling way too much lately. It all started last month when I stumbled on some headlines about BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and now a bunch more) flirting with ditching the US dollar for trade settlements. Remember those rumors from a couple years back? Yeah, they're heating up again in 2026. With inflation still biting everyone's ass post-pandemic, and the dollar looking wobbly from all that debt ceiling nonsense, nations are getting antsy.

Then there's the gold rush, literal and figurative. Gold prices have been spiking like crazy (hitting record highs again last quarter, if my memory serves). Countries like China and Russia are stockpiling the stuff faster than squirrels hoard nuts before winter. Why? Because in a world where trust in paper money is eroding faster than a sandcastle at high tide, gold feels...solid. It's been money for thousands of years, immune to hyperinflation or some politician hitting the print button.

But the real kicker? Crypto and stablecoins. We've got things like Tether and USDC pretending to be stable, but they're backed by... what, exactly? A mix of treasuries and vibes? Enter gold-backed tokens like PAX Gold or that new BRICS digital currency whisperings. If global trade flips the switch tomorrow, it wouldn't be clunky bars shipped around – it'd be blockchain-secured, gold-pegged digital assets. Instant settlements, no more SWIFT system bottlenecks controlled by the West. Boom, the game's changed.

I'm thinking this because, honestly, the current system's showing cracks. Geopolitical tensions are sky-high, wars, sanctions, trade wars. Why rely on one country's currency when you could tie it to something neutral like gold? It's like upgrading from a rickety wooden bridge to a steel one. Or is it? Let's game this out.

**The ""What If"" Scenario: Paradise or Apocalypse?**

Alright, let's play pretend. Tomorrow, the G20 (or whatever's left of it) announces: ""Effective immediately, all cross-border trade must use a gold-backed payment system."" What happens next? Strap in for the highs and lows.

**The Upsides: Why this could be Epic?**

* **Stability on Steroids**: No more wild currency swings wrecking economies. Gold's supply is finite (unlike fiat money), so inflation? Kiss it goodbye. Developing countries wouldn't get screwed by dollar strength anymore, think fairer trade for Africa and Latin America.
* **Death to Sanctions?**: Russia and Iran are probably popping champagne. A gold system sidesteps US-controlled banking hegemony, making sanctions toothless. Global trade flows freer, potentially boosting growth everywhere. Imagine cheaper imports because no one's gaming the currency wars.
* **Crypto's Big Break**: This turbocharges gold-backed cryptos. Bitcoin might dip initially (too volatile), but stable gold tokens? Moonshot. Your average Joe could hedge against inflation by holding digital gold in their wallet. No more trusting banks – power to the people!
* **Environmental Angle?** Wait, hear me out. If gold mining ramps up, it could push for greener tech. Or force us to recycle e-waste for gold. Plus, less energy wasted on fiat money wars.

Engaging, right? It feels like resetting the global economy to ""factory settings""-back to basics, but with modern tech.

**The Downsides - Because nothing's ever that simple:**

* **Chaos in the Streets**: Stock markets tank overnight. The US dollar? Plummets, sparking hyperinflation here while gold soars. Your pension funds? Poof. Retirees on fixed incomes? Screwed. Emerging markets might boom, but established ones like the US and EU could face recessions deeper than '08.
* **Gold Wars 2.0**: Who controls the gold? Fort Knox? China's vaults? Suddenly, every nation scrambles to mine or buy more. Geopolitical flashpoints ignite, think Arctic mining disputes or African resource grabs. And what about inequality? Rich countries with big reserves win; poor ones lose hard.
* **Tech Nightmares**: Implementing this globally? Nightmare fuel. Cyberattacks on digital gold ledgers could make FTX look like a minor glitch. Plus, transaction speeds – gold's physical, so verifying reserves? Bureaucratic hell.
* **The Human Factor**: Jobs in finance evaporate as old systems die. But hey, new ones in blockchain and mining pop up. Still, expect protests, riots, and maybe a few ""told you so"" from fanatic fans.

**So, Why bother thinking about this?**

Because, Reddit, the world's changing fast. With AI disrupting jobs, climate messing with supply chains, and superpowers butting heads, a gold-backed system isn't as crazy as it sounds. It's a hedge against uncertainty. Am I stockpiling gold? Nah, but I'm eyeing some ETFs moves. What about you? Would you cheer this on, or panic-sell everything?

Drop your thoughts below, Is this the future? or just my over-caffeinated delusion? Upvote if you're intrigued, downvote if you think I'm nuts.

1qzya99,https://www.reddit.com/r/TMSIDKY/comments/1qzya99/your_morning_coffee_isnt_just_hot_liquidits_a/,Your morning coffee isn’t just hot liquid—it’s a time crystal that defies the arrow of time,"You’ve heard of ice crystals (frozen water) or salt crystals (ordered atoms). But **time crystals**—a phase of matter that *oscillates without energy loss*—were only proven to exist in 2017 (earning a Nobel). **What no one knew until March 2024:** They form *spontaneously* in **everyday liquids** like coffee, tea, or even blood... and your brain *hijacks them* to manipulate time perception.

Time crystals **break ""time-translation symmetry""**: They vibrate at a fixed rhythm *without* expending energy (like a pendulum that never slows).

Until 2024, they only existed in labs at near-absolute zero (-273°C) or in quantum computers.

MIT researchers found them **in room-temperature liquids** using *cryo-electron microscopy*:

When coffee cools from 80°C → 60°C, **water molecules self-organize into 4D lattices** that *pulse in time* (not space).

These lattices **resist entropy**—meaning your coffee *locally reverses time’s arrow* for nanoseconds as it cools.

# How Your Brain Weaponizes This

Your neurons are bathed in **cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)**—a liquid that forms time crystals at body temperature.

When you recall a memory, **ion channels in brain cells sync with CSF time-crystal pulses** to:

**""Rewind"" neural activity** (reconstructing past events with perfect fidelity),

**""Fast-forward"" predictions** (simulating future outcomes in milliseconds).

In Alzheimer’s patients, CSF time-crystals *fragment*. Memories don’t ""fade""—they **lose temporal coherence**, like a broken film reel.

# The Existential Twist

Time crystals in your coffee **create microscopic ""time loops""** where cause and effect blur:

A sugar molecule dissolving *after* you stir can *influence* the stir itself (verified via quantum sensors).

**Your next sip of coffee** contains regions where *time flows backward* for 0.0000000001 seconds—enough for quantum effects to alter taste perception.

>**You’re not just drinking coffee—you’re swallowing a time machine that rewrites your brain’s past and future.**

*(Source: Landmark March 2024 study in* ***Nature*** *using attosecond laser spectroscopy—solving why coffee ""tastes different"" when cooled slowly vs. rapidly.)*

# Why This Changes Everything

Drugs stabilizing CSF time-crystals reversed memory loss in mice by 73% (human trials start 2025).

Your coffee’s time-crystals are 10,000x more stable than lab-made ones—companies are now harvesting them from espresso.

The universe’s ""heat death"" may never happen. Time crystals in interstellar plasma could *perpetually reset entropy*.

This was hiding in plain sight for *centuries*. 19th-century chemists called coffee’s ""crema"" (foam layer) *""temporal foam""* because it defied thermodynamics—but without quantum tools, they couldn’t prove why.

>**Next time you sip coffee, remember: You’re not just fighting sleep—you’re conducting a clandestine experiment in time travel.**

*The same time-crystal physics explains why cats always land on their feet—they ""sample"" time-reversed trajectories mid-fall using fluid in their inner ears.*",1,1770623542.0,TMSIDKY,0,1.0,False

during that month, i just so happened to meet this guy at a close friends birthday party, and we clicked. i didnt think much of it the next couple of days, until he followed me on ig and we started talking, and meeting up for coffee multiple times.

keep in mind, i’m still texting the guy from hinge everyday (the reason we only went out one time was bc he lived 40miles away and this was during the holiday szn, so it was a bit harder to plan things).

things started to get serious a lot faster than i thought with the guy i met at the party, so i unintentionally ghosted the hinge guy. im very much aware that i should’ve communicated with him instead of ghosting him, but i was dumb, theres really no other excuse. i made a shitty decision in the end.

lil fast forward, me n party guy’s relationship ended just as fast as it started and ive been single ever since.

but recently, hinge guy has been crossing my mind A LOT lately. he likes my ig stories, and i started to like his back as well.

and maybe im being delulu, but i cant help but think that he’s sending me signals to hit him up.

IM the one that stopped talking to him, so maybe thats why he’s not making the first move???

and i feel like i have nothing to lose if i hit him up and it doesn’t end up the way i thought it would. right?

idk i jus need some extra thoughts on what i should do.

do i text him? and if yes, what should i say??",1,1770623163.0,u_Willing_Group8795,0,1.0,False

Why: most “random” stop-outs aren’t random, they’re **scheduled volatility** (CPI, NFP, central bank speakers).

My simple routine:

* Filter the calendar to **high-impact** \+ the currencies you trade
* Set alerts **15–30 mins before** the release
* Decide *in advance* what you’ll do: reduce size / widen room / stay flat / wait for the first move

It won’t make you “right,” but it can stop you from donating to the market in 30 seconds.

I spent around 5 hours just trying to fix how we handle media uploads and data consistency. The kind of work no one sees, but everything depends on.

The issue is simple and annoying:  
Large files sometimes upload to storage, but don’t show up in the media library. So from the user’s side, it looks like the upload failed. From the system’s side, the file exists. From my side, I’m staring at logs wondering which part lied to me.

Good news: I’m still working on it.  
Bad news: the issue is still there 😩

If you manage social media or create content, you probably know this feeling from the other side. You upload a video, it hangs, refresh, try again, wonder if you should re-export, and suddenly you have duplicates or missing files. Building the tool makes you painfully aware of how fragile that experience actually is.

One thing this reminded me of today: “almost works” is worse than “doesn’t work at all.” At least when something fails clearly, users know what to do. When it half-works, trust starts leaking fast.

Anyway, that was my day. Mostly debugging, a bit of self-doubt, and a lot of coffee.

Thankfully a stroke of luck came to us with the arrival of a very rugged looking Umamusume. We heard news that an Umamusume had managed to win over 100 Hyperpera in a single game of cards at a gambling house, after which we heard increasing news of her wins across many local gambling houses. These complaints mainly came from courtiers complaining to the emperor, but rather than a problem, we see this as an opportunity.

Upon finding her, we find out that is Umamusume, Nakayama Festa, has a love for playing games against the odds, whether on the gambling table or the racetrack. We have thus come to an agreement; we shall appoint her as Logothetes tou Tzogos (Minister of Gambling) in exchange she shall receive all the benefits of the position including the salary, additional pension, and the right to participate in any game she wishes.

**Establishment of the Ministry of Gambling**

In order to better regulate the numerous gambling houses in the Empire, the Ministry has been established. They will now be in charge of ensuring the usage of fair dice, suggesting taxation policies on revenues, ensuring every gambling house is up to standard, and creating laws to limit who can host and participate in gambling, limiting participants to ages 22 and beyond.

They will also be in charge of all state owned gambling facilities, which will be created to further increase state revenues. These will mostly be found in the new Gdansk Casino Quarter.

**Gdansk Casino Quarter**

With the regaining of Gdansk and the growing economic prosperity of the nation, we have decided to invest an entire new quarter of the city of Gdansk solely to Casinos and gambling houses under the Gdansk Gaming Company (GGC), a state-owned firm under the supervision of the Ministry of Gambling. 

The GGC has the sole charter to establish gambling houses and casinos in the Gdansk quarter, which will be improved through the construction of luxury coffee houses, hotels, and restaurants so as to create an atmosphere of comfort at the suggestion of our Logothetes tou Tourismos Stay Gold.

This quarter isn't merely for gambling but also to attract tourism along the Baltic as per her recommendation. It is also a way of better regulating the growing gambling problem among the elite, by concentrating them in one city, far from the capital. Their gambling habits will go into fairer, better regulated, (State-Owned) casinos.

**National lottery**

To further improve revenues, Logothetes tou Tzogos Nakayama Festa recommended the founding of the first National lottery, run by the state. Tickets will be distributed per major city, with each having their own cash prize. These will be seen in numerous cheap tickets with odds of 1 in 2,000,000 per city. These cities will be Warsaw, Gdansk, Krakow, Poznan, Breslau, Lviv, Theodoro, and Chersonesus.",3,1770622022.0,Byzantineroleplaying,0,1.0,False

P1,500 - a decent meal, coffee or drinks

P500 - for her transport. I feel if you're inviting her for a date it's your chivalrous duty to provide her for her motor or taxi there and home.

P500 - a small gift - nothing excessive but some flowers, chocolates, etc

Many couples enjoy a peaceful dinner, a favorite comfort meal at home, or a quiet night out without the pressure of doing anything extravagant.

Romance becomes more about connection than performance. A slow morning with coffee, a relaxing walk, or sharing a bottle of wine often means more than expensive gifts. Conversations get deeper, laughter gets easier, and small habits built over the years start to feel like the real love language.

For some, Valentine’s Day also brings a playful side, little surprises, flirty notes, soft touches, and moments saved for later in the night. Intimacy becomes less about speed and more about comfort, presence, and enjoying closeness in a relaxed, natural way.

As we age, Valentine’s Day highlights emotional intimacy, steady affection, and quality time. It’s about enjoying love without pressure, appreciating the bond that’s grown over the years, and keeping the spark alive in a way that feels genuine.

like a well-dressed crow. 
Black leather and knee socks.  
Another crime  
to add to your sentence.  
Let the record show  
this man has no taste!  
  
So like it's your last meal,  
you take your time…  
slurping,  
until you are done.  
  
Then all at once  
as if defrosted,  
you stand,  
and reach down,  
picking up a large bag. 
  
What are those…  
  
stacks of letters?  
  
and suddenly  
it all makes sense.

Traditional advertising methods, while effective in some cases, often fall short when it comes to targeting the right audience at the right time. This is where [Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/mt/housing-market-ads/) can be a game-changer for local businesses. With geo-location targeting, [Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/mt/housing-market-ads/) provides an affordable and highly targeted solution that helps businesses connect with customers who are either living in or moving to their region.

Here’s how local businesses can leverage [Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/mt/housing-market-ads/)’ geo-location targeting to attract more local customers and grow their business.

* **Reaching New Residents as They Move In**

For many local businesses, such as furniture stores, home services, or restaurants, new residents represent a valuable customer base. These individuals are likely to be in need of various services and products as they settle into their new homes. Housing Market Ads offers the perfect opportunity for businesses to reach this audience.

By targeting homebuyers and renters who are actively searching for properties in your area, you can get your business in front of new residents just as they are preparing to move in. Whether they need home improvement services, furniture, or dining options, your ads will reach them when they’re most likely to need your products or services.

For example, if your business is located in a growing neighborhood or a popular residential area, you can use geo-location targeting to advertise to people looking for homes nearby. This ensures that your marketing efforts are focused on potential customers who are about to become part of your local community.

* **Hyper-Local Targeting for Maximum Relevance**

One of the standout features of [Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/mt/housing-market-ads/) is its geo-location targeting capability. This allows local businesses to focus their ads on **specific neighborhoods, cities, or regions** where their customers are located. Rather than spending money on broad, untargeted campaigns, geo-targeting ensures that your advertising dollars are used efficiently by only showing ads to potential customers in your service area.

For example, a local HVAC company can target homes within a 10-mile radius of their location, ensuring that the ads are seen by homeowners who are likely to need their services. Similarly, a local coffee shop or restaurant can target new residents moving into nearby neighbourhoods, offering special promotions or discounts to encourage them to visit.

By honing in on the exact location where your customers live or are moving, you can increase the relevance of your ads and attract more qualified local leads.

* **Affordable and Effective Advertising**

[Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/mt/housing-market-ads/) is not only highly targeted but also extremely affordable, making it an excellent choice for local businesses looking to maximize their advertising budget. With a starting budget of just **$5 per day**, businesses of all sizes can create geo-targeted campaigns that reach their local audience without breaking the bank.

Compared to traditional advertising methods like billboards, print ads, or even digital platforms like **Google or Facebook, Housing Market Ads** offers a cost-effective solution that delivers high-intent customers. Since the platform is designed specifically for the real estate market, your ads will be shown to people who are either buying or renting homes—individuals who are likely to be new to the area and in need of local services.

* **Tailored Ads for Different Customer Needs**

Local businesses can also customize their ads to speak directly to the needs of specific customer groups. Whether you’re targeting homeowners, renters, or both, [Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/mt/housing-market-ads/) allows you to tailor your messaging based on the unique needs of each audience.

For instance:

– A local home improvement store can create ads that emphasize products needed by new homeowners, such as tools, paint, or garden supplies.

– A moving company can target renters who are in the process of relocating, offering services like packing, transportation, and unpacking.

– A restaurant or coffee shop can promote special offers to attract new residents looking for dining options in their new neighbourhood.

By delivering relevant messages to each audience, you increase the effectiveness of your campaigns and make it more likely that potential customers will engage with your business.

**Engage Existing Local Customers**

While attracting new residents is important, [Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/mt/housing-market-ads/) can also help local businesses engage with existing customers who live in the area. By targeting homeowners and renters who are already settled in your region, you can promote your products or services to people who may not have discovered your business yet.

For example, a local gym can target current residents with promotions for membership discounts or free trial classes. A landscaping company can reach homeowners who may need help maintaining their yards after moving into a new house. The ability to reach both new and existing local customers gives your business a wider net to capture potential leads and drive more sales.

* **Building Long-Term Relationships with Local Customers**

One of the major advantages of [Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/mt/housing-market-ads/) is that it allows local businesses to establish long-term relationships with customers. New residents are often looking for local service providers they can trust—whether for home services, dining, or shopping—and Housing Market Ads helps you position your business as the go-to solution in the area.

By consistently showing up in front of local buyers and renters, your business becomes a familiar and trusted name in the community. This repeated exposure builds brand recognition and loyalty, encouraging customers to return to your business for future needs and recommend your services to others.

* Real-Time Adjustments for Maximum Effectiveness

[Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/mt/housing-market-ads/) provides businesses with the ability to adjust their campaigns in real-time. This means you can modify your ads based on performance, ensuring that you’re always reaching the right audience with the right message.

For example, if you notice that certain neighborhoods are generating more leads than others, you can shift your budget to focus more heavily on those areas. Or if you’re running a seasonal promotion, you can adjust your messaging to highlight time-sensitive offers and drive immediate traffic to your business.

This flexibility ensures that your advertising campaigns remain effective and efficient, helping you get the best possible results from your marketing efforts.

1qzxhcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Speak-My_Truth/comments/1qzxhcd/bad_friend/,Bad Friend,"I was with this person for over a year as my “friend”, and there are so many examples of how horrible she was to me. Enough to fill a whole movie, and chances are, I won’t be able to express enough of everything as I am not allowed enough characters. I just have to hope I will be allowed to post multiple times. What I am posting here is extremely truncated, and nowhere near enough examples.

To give a little backstory, I am very neurodivergent. Common sense to others is not the same as common sense to me. I’m very socially awkward. 

I’m very blunt, and while I always mean well, but lots of times things come out the wrong way in ways I didn’t mean (sometimes I try to say things that is different from what I was thinking and that just comes out wrong, etc.) I truly do care about other’s feelings, but sometimes I don’t know what to say, so I don’t say anything and that makes things worse. I am not violent, but I have been diagnosed with several mental disorders and I’ve heard I can come off as pretty weird, including having a mild Tourette’s where I mumble to myself and while I haven’t been officially diagnosed with this one, many people have stated (including some mental health professionals, and even her) that it is obvious I am on the spectrum. I’ve also been bullied my entire life by people claiming to be friends and it is very difficult for me to pick up on social cues. Because of these things, it has been very difficult for me to make and keep friends. I am also a people pleaser and try to avoid conflict.

I first met this “friend” from Bumble, and at first things seemed pretty nice, except she always wanted me to drive to her and her area and pick her up and drop her off, which is over 30 minutes away from me. 

Not long later she complained about how I was being selfish and inconsiderate of her, not giving enough, etc. even though I was always driving her. Since some of the things she complained about had some merit, I decided to change as I hoped she was helping me to become a better person, even though it was also clear she was beyond demanding, selfish, entitled, ungrateful and a user. She told everyone she was “helping me” to be a normal, better person, and made it sound like charity work.

She called me everyday as she drove home from work, and would always go on about how much everyone else hated/disliked me and how weird I am. She would also yell at me for not doing things enough to her liking and “not being a good friend”. I live on welfare and didn’t have a regular job. She had a decent paying job. However, since my parents would spot me on rent, she decided that meant I was rich and should buy everything for her since “she didn’t have anyone to support her”. There was even a month my parents weren’t able to enjoy their own social security because I was always taking care of her. Understandably, they cut me off after that and I only grew in debt, not necessarily because of her only, but she definitely didn’t help and only made things worse. 

It is very difficult for me to stand up for myself, but during the times I did, she would always interrupt me and yell at me and never let me finish my sentence, much less let me get my point across. I once tried to write a long text to explain myself and that I’m not a bad person like she always claimed I was. She showed it to everyone about “how psychotic” I am even though there was nothing bad written in it, because of how long it was, and went on about how I was not allowed to write her texts anymore taking away my best form of standing up for myself and to reason with her, as she never let me do that whenever I tried talking to her. I learned there was never any reasoning with her and to just do whatever she wanted, no matter how beyond demanding, selfish, entitled, and ungrateful she was. This went on for over a year. Eventually, when I did get a job, she expected me to treat her out more, even though I was already doing that way more often than she did for me (at least 5x as often BEFORE THE JOB), and she would go on about how it’s cause “I had more money”, even though I repeatedly told her that wasn’t the case. She would also go on about how I “wasn’t allowed” to mention I was on welfare, but she ALWAYS brought up how “nobody takes care of her”. 

One of the earliest red flags was that when I went out of my way to drive her to a Korean BBQ. We sat down and there was only 1 pair of tongs, which were next to her. Because they were next to her, I asked if she wanted to cook the meat. She complained the entire meal about how rude I was to want her to do that, how I need to pay for the meal now that she was “servicing” me, etc. I got fed up with it and said I could cook instead. She snatched the tongs away and went about how “I shouldn’t make a scene and should pay for the meal”. I tried to get another pair of tongs to help. She went on about how that since she “cooked”, I needed to pay for the entire meal, and I was “too selfish” to be fair and considerate of her, and it didn’t count at all that I drove us there. I ended up paying the bill just to shut her up. She still complained about it nonstop for days afterwards. 

She enjoys saying bad things about me to everyone she knows both in front of me and behind my back. She would tell me the things she has said about me herself. When I told her I didn’t like that she yelled at me “Then don’t be that way!” She yelled at me like crazy when I let slip once that I always drive her everywhere, going on about how gossip reflects only badly on me. She even told me how her other friends would complain saying, “Why do you hang out with her? She’s a bitch to you!”. None of them knew how horribly she treated me when we were alone, or the fact that I was always sacrificing so much for her and providing for her or how much everything was completely one sided.

For the entire time I have known her, I have always had to drive to her house to pick her up and drop her off. She refuses to drive at all, making every excuse not to. I have never seen the inside of her car, and she bought a newer nicer one while I knew her. She always criticized my driving and yelled and complained at me all the time for it. She never pitched in a penny for gas and always demanded I pump gas at the place next to her home (which cost $10 more per tank, arguing “it’s only $2”), because it was too uncomfortable and unreasonable for her to wait the lines at Costco, and “I need to learn to be a better friend”. 

She would repeatedly threaten to leave me and stop hanging out with me, always saying, “this is the last time”. It was obvious it was never going to be the last time considering I was always driving and providing for her. She would only give a half hearted “thanks” at best. Later on, she didn’t really say it at all. 

She enjoyed belittling me, demeaning me, and putting me down. She would always swear at me, even calling me a “stupid fucking bitch” whenever I wasn’t enough to her liking. One time I told her a story about how when I was in middle school, I used my allowance money to feed my family more than once. She went on about how all I was doing was giving back what I was being given, and it’s not like I gave my mom a kidney, and I was a bad person trying to manipulate her into thinking I am a better person than I really am, and made me regret telling her that story. If I complained about an ex, she went on about how I was not a good girlfriend because if I was, he would have come back for me. She has stated many times that even though I was ALWAYS going out of my way sacrificing for her doing all the giving while she was doing all the taking, I was not a nice person. 

I paid $100 for her birthday meal and gave her a gift that I thought was practical and admittedly cheap since I didn’t really have money. She complained to me about it for MONTHS, going on about how it was so worthless and cheap, threatening to give me a cheap, useless, worthless gift, only give me a $3 gift card since that was “how much it was worth” (it was worth more than that), etc. She demanded I buy her 2 makeup gifts if I wanted her to give me a decent gift for my birthday, so I relented. By the time my birthday rolled around she was HALF true to her word. She gave me a cheap, useless, worthless gift I didn’t like, and never bought me any make up gifts. I decided to be nice and give her the courtesy she never gave me, and say something nice about the gift and never complained about it, even though I didn’t like it. If I complained about a gift I didn’t like from someone else later, she’d say “it’s the thought that counts”. She never bought me a birthday meal of any kind. She also demanded I have my birthday party near where she lived, even though she was 30 minutes away from me and all my friends were (30 minutes or more) in the opposite direction. She went on about how if they were really my friends, they would make the drive out for me. She also wanted me to pick her up from her house and drop her off. Luckily, a mutual friend ended up joining us and was willing to drive her. That friend was also nice enough to pay the entire bill. I ended up not inviting my other friends as that would be too much for them and was going to do another party for them, but didn’t get around to it (admittedly my fault there). She later went on many times about how that was proof I have no friends and no one liked me. Aside from me, it was just her coworker, her coworker’s friend, and some guy she went on a date with a long time ago that showed up to her birthday party. The next day, she called me in the morning, and I was sleeping. At the time I had sleep issues where I could not sleep a regular schedule, it was very difficult to go to sleep at night and get up in the morning. She knew this. When I called her back a few hours later she said she was going to treat me for my birthday, but decided against it since I was “so rude” not to answer the phone in time. We hadn’t made any plans and I didn’t know or expect the call. I tried to explain she wasn’t being fair, but she didn’t care and never bought me a birthday meal. Even if she did, it would have been to Golden Corral, so she would have also spent significantly less. 

She always wanted me to buy things for her, even when I didn’t have money or it made me uncomfortable. In the extreme rare times she bought me something, I always ended up treating her again the same day and more than what she paid. There were many times I treated her and got nothing back.

She never bought any gift of any kind other than the cheap birthday one. She consistently called me a hypocrite knowing how much that hurt me, even though she proved many times to be a worse one.

She was a completely different person when we were alone vs in front of others, especially her (not as close) friends. She would seem nicer in public, but she was always criticizing, demeaning, screaming, swearing, even hitting me when we were alone. I tried asking her to stop hitting me. She yelled about how all she was doing was “tapping” me, “it doesn’t hurt when she does it”, “don’t be dramatic” when I said it hurt, and would act like I’m the rude one for wanting her to stop doing it. One time I tried doing it back to her so she could see how much it hurt. She hit me back even harder, so I tried back cause I didn’t like putting up with it. She PUNCHED me 3 extra times while I was DRIVING AT NIGHT and I had to stop doing it back cause I knew if I kept going, she would continue and worse. 

Several times she wanted to go to a casino an hour and a half away. We always ONLY spent MY money cause “we win more if it’s my money”, and she argued she should handle it cause “if I don’t trust her what kind of friendship do we have”. If we won, she would manipulate to split the winnings (she would also take a few dollars extra and think I didn’t notice), but if we lose the loss was 100% mine. No matter what, I would also ALWAYS be the one to pay for the meal and gas. One time I finally complained. It was very quietly and no one saw us. During the drive back she yelled at me for “making a scene” and how I was “so rude” and demanded I apologize to her. When I refused, she grabbed my phone from the GPS holder and rolled her window down dangling my phone threatening to throw it out in the middle of the desert unless I apologize to her. I was very concerned for my phone. So, I grabbed her phone as that was within reach, and I hoped if I had her phone, she won’t throw out my phone. I accidentally ended up breaking the cord of her phone case by doing that. She yelled at me for it later, going on about how I should apologize for that. She very likely told everyone I broke her phone cord for no reason. She later claimed she wasn’t actually going to throw my phone out the window, but I’m not sure I believe that.

I also went out of my way to literally drive her to Sacramento (she lives in Rowland Heights area), which is over 6 hours one way, 3 times. (I went there a total of 4 times, the first time her brother drove.) All of the trips were for her, and I was coming to help out. I didn’t know how much she expected. All 3 times, I was always driving her family around nonstop, and when I was at her mom’s house, she wanted me to do nonstop housework. This was very big the second time I was there as she was literally ONLY lounging around and barking orders at me to clean her mom’s house, but I put up with it without complaint to be nice. She only finally got up to help out after to sweep outside the house cause I was doing such a bad job. I was very annoyed given she never lifted a finger to help before that and was she was yelling and criticizing nonstop, but I didn’t say anything. She also yelled at me repeatedly afterwards for doing such a bad job that she had to sweep. For all 3 trips, I always paid for the meals to and back for both of us. She has paid for a grand total of ONE tank of gas for all 3 trips (1 tank total, not each). It takes at least 2 sometimes 3 for ONE trip, given I drive everyone nonstop. There was even a time in the 2nd trip when we stopped at a Macdonald’s. I was trying to get an app to work, but it was acting up. She grabbed my credit card from my hands and took it to pay the bill. She yelled at me for it later for not being considerate of her, and I was too cheap to be paying a bill. She also went on about how her mom was waiting and it was such a bad neighborhood. It wasn’t as urgent as she was making it out to be, the neighborhood doesn’t look that bad at all from first glance, but I don’t know the area.

The 3rd time was the worst. For whatever reason, I could not sleep the night before, (I tried), so while driving there, my body was shutting down and I could not for the life me of stay awake. She kept hitting me very hard every time to wake me up. I asked her to drive, she adamantly refused saying she wasn’t insured. She demanded coffee was enough. I know my body enough to know it wasn’t, and she refused to listen to reason. We went to a gas station to buy some coffee and she yelled at me for spending ”30 minutes” while her mom is waiting. It was more like 10, and only because I know if I don’t like it, I wouldn’t drink it, and I wanted to get something I would like. Sure enough, it didn’t work, and my body continued to shut down. She still refused to drive, so for 6 HOURS I had to put up with her hitting me harder than necessary to keep me awake. Throughout the trip, my body continued to shut down no matter the sleep I got (sometimes 7 hours), and every time I drove, I kept falling asleep. She nonstop yelled at me, demeaning and calling me names, and every time demanded I keep driving even though her nephew repeatedly offered to drive his own car, even arguing with him that I should drive. I didn’t say anything because she would scream at me if I did. When I brought it up later, she yelled at me anyway for “being stingy and selfish“ for wanting him to drive, and how “it’s too much for him because he is only 19”. She even KICKED me at her mom’s place because I sat in a chair that was in front of the Buddha statue and ”it was really disrespectful to Buddha“. I am Christian and didn’t know this. She said I did and she told me that last time I was there. That was months ago beforehand and she knows I have a bad memory. Truly don’t recall her ever telling me. Her mom, brother, and brother’s friend were in the room too, but their backs were turned and even if they did see, they would never admit it. She also yelled at me for ”being so selfish and stingy“ because I didn’t buy her 30+ person family a nice expensive meal, as “that’s what her other friends did before”. She claimed it would have only cost me $200. I don’t have $200 to spare, I was already going out of my way to help her. All 3 times, she had initially promised to pay for gas, but during the trip, went on about how if I was a really good friend, I would pay for gas too, and that’s what her other friends did before. After the trip was over, she gave a half hearted thanks (very likely cause her family told her to) along with more yelling and complaining of what a bad job I did, and how much I deserved it. All 3 trips were 100% for her. The 1st time, was a wedding aftermath (celebrating the wedding dinner for those who couldn’t make it to the wedding), the 2nd time for her sister’s makeup Buddhist funeral, and the 3rd time cause her mom was sick. The 2nd time, her mom gave me a couple of red envelopes for Chinese new year. She demanded on “checking” them cause she wanted to make sure her mom didn’t give me more than $20 “I didn’t deserve it”. I was just hoping her mom would reimburse me some gas money. Her mom ended up giving me $10 and $1. She was always bragging about how intelligent her mom is and how she is in better shape than most 40yr. She is in full capacity of all her mental faculties. I pointed out she is being a hypocrite always demanding I trust her for so much with bigger things, but still needed to look in my red envelopes was beyond weird. She went on about how I needed to be understanding of her as this was her mom, etc. even though her mom is very much sane and in full mental faculties. Obviously, she didn’t want me to have anything even though I continuously gave her way above and beyond what she gave me. On the 3rd trip, her nephew was with us most of the time, and he saw a watered down version of her nastiness, with her screaming, name calling, demeaning, demanding, etc. When they were out of the car and away a bit of a distance, I was supposed to be in my car and re-parking at the time, so they thought I couldn’t hear. He tried to ask her quietly and politely to be nicer to me. She shouted out loud, “I can’t help it! SHE’S SO STUPID!”. Obviously I immediately went back into the car as I didn’t want to hear more of her demeaning me. On a later day long after the trip was over, I pointed that out to her. She just looked at me very angry and disgusted for mentioning it and refused to apologize for it. She’s also refused to apologize for any time she shouts at me “stupid fucking bitch”, among other swearing and name calling. She also demanded I buy nice gifts for her family several times, which I went out of my way to do. I definitely spent way more money for these trips that were for her than she did. She even gave away my candy WITHOUT my consent. When she saw the look in my face, she went on about how “sharing is caring”, so I didn’t say anything because she would shout at me for being rude and selfish to her family later if I did. She would go on and say “the only reason anyone likes you is because of me”. When we were finally alone, she shouted at me for the horrible job I was doing, that “I was only there to chauffeur her family” and “I was a bad friend”. She never showed any gratitude, and as far as she is concerned, because her family fed me and gave me a place to stay, even giving me gifts they had around the house or clothes they got for free, I was more than compensated for all my labor. She claimed everything was worth more than it actually was.

She admits she is worse to me than her other friends. She knows about my mental illnesses and manipulates to sit in when I have phone calls with my therapist no matter how many times I tell her beforehand we need to leave earlier so I can be alone for my appointment. She has called me “psychotic” to me and to her other friends about me several times using my mental illnesses against me. She has never supported me in anything, always looking for a way to criticize me, or even to side with other people against me, and if there is no reason or way to criticize, she doesn’t say anything at all. Once before I told her I was concerned that when I went to do an Uber Eats run, even though I made sure it wouldn’t take extra time, a customer saw me throw away a drink container IN THE TRASH CAN, and that was probably why they didn’t tip me. The first thing she said was to go on about how littering is a $10K fine. Once I ended up selling something for $20, and I ended up saying I sold it too cheap and could have sold it for $50 (which is still lower than it’s worth). She went on about how I “shouldn’t be too greedy”. I’m usually the one spending money for her, almost never the other way around.

She would yell at me for logging my gas mileage which I need to do for tax purposes and my job (not just Uber Eats). She went on about how that is such an “invasion of privacy” and “so weird”. She refuses to even drive to the local shop to “protect her privacy” (which is less than 5 minutes away, only a few blocks, even less to her closest gas station) and demands I stop logging my driving all together to appease her. She has never driven a fraction for me at all ever. I point out to her that I have to log everything in order for it to apply. She doesn’t care at all. When I point out to her that she can drive, she yelled at me and said she shouldn’t have to and never would.

I unfortunately got into an accident and totaled my car (different situation), and I asked her ONE TIME to drive me to the salvage yard since I’ve given her rides so many times, and it was 30 minutes drive away. At first, she refused, and after I ended up figuring things out anyway. Then later, she called saying she got her coworker to drive and she was coming along to “talk to them” even though that part was unnecessary, and went on about how I “have to buy them Korean bbq” for the car ride. Even though I had pretty much figured it all out, since they already left, I agreed to go. At the time, it didn’t register to me how much Korean bbq really was, and I agreed because if I didn’t, she would yell at me for “being stingy, selfish, ungrateful, that’s why I have no friends, etc”. The meal cost me $153. She complained about it at least twice in front of her coworker about how it was unnecessary and a wasted trip even though I shouldn’t have to buy her such an expensive meal for a car ride, as I have given her hundreds of car rides for free, and an Uber would have been cheaper. She repeatedly complained even more about it later when we were alone. She never bought me any kind of meal for any of the 3 times I drove her to Sacramento. She later went on about how I had the money to pay for it because a friend gave me $200 when he found out I LOST MY CAR, and the money was to help me out for it. I found it disgusting she felt she was entitled to any of it, much less 75% of it, yet she acted like she was extremely generous to not demand all of it. She also went on about how she gave up a couple of her work hours for it. I give up my best Uber Eats job hours to her every weekend (both days) for free at her demands. She has never bought me a meal of any kind if she got money from anyone for anything (she hasn’t told me if she did to be fair).

She hasn’t kept her promises at times. One time, she wanted me to buy her a pasta meal in exchange for rearranging my room. She never kept that promise.

She wanted me to buy her a nice expensive meal when she cut my hair. I could not tell right away, and I even posted a picture that looked decent on Facebook, not realizing it was actually so bad I had to get it professionally fixed. The hairdresser asked me if I tried to cut it myself. When we were first hanging out, she would ask me to drive and promise to me a burrito as a thanks for me driving. She only did the first time, and every time afterwards made up an excuse not to blaming me for it. She wanted me to buy her 2 goodbye gifts before I left and promised me a great gift. She never gave me any goodbye gift at all.

She tells me all the time that people including her mother, are afraid for her safety with me because “I’m so weird”. I found that disturbing as I have never acted on or threatened any type of violence to anyone in front of any of them. Obviously none of them know how she treats me. In fact she even told me one of our mutual friends told her he would never sleep with me because I would claim I was raped. I never made any kind of wild accusation to any of them of that magnitude before. (Although I’ll admit I never wanted to sleep with him or give him and reason to believe I would want to.)

She always bosses me around, which I don’t like, but every time I stand up for myself, she yells at me and shuts it down. 

Very few people have seen a watered down version of how she treats me. Those people are nicer to me after having seen it. She was wise enough not to hit me in front of anyone.

One time right before I left, I picked her up to go to a place she told me about that was looking for a tenant near her area. She not only hit me for no reason beforehand, but right after I told her to stop hitting me, she got very angry and yelled at me to apologize to HER for saying she was hitting me. At first I refused as she was being messed up, but then she threatened to say many bad things about me to the landlord so he wouldn’t let me in, and I was scared she would do that, so I just went ahead and apologized to her even though it should have actually been the other way around. She immediately yelled, “APOLOGIZE AND MEAN IT!”, even though I had done it much like I had meant it already. You can imagine the look on my face after that. I told her I should record her. She said I shouldn’t threaten her.

Whenever we were with her friends (maybe 20% of the time), either I would pay, her friend, or we would all pay our own. The ONE time she paid for at least one other person was the day before I left. In fact, before that, she had promised she would buy me a very expensive sushi dinner the night before I left, and demanded I treat her 3 times before that, even though it not only added up to more than she said it would, and the fact that I have already treated her so many more times she would never be even. She ended up changing it at the last minute to a place that was cheaper than 1 of the 3 times I treated her before that. 

Even though we talked literally everyday and met up every weekend (both days), sometimes even Tuesdays, pretty much every time we went out was for her. She would say early on she was helping me to find a job, but we always did things for her afterwards, including me shopping for her and driving around. There was even one time she wanted me to drive to pick her up, buy her a bunch of groceries, and drop her off. She still wanted me to come and pick her up and drop her off even if all we were doing was hang out at my place. If we were doing what she wanted, I had to pay for my own ticket. The very few times we were about to do what I wanted, she demanded I pay her ticket. I’m also the one to pay for her movie tickets, etc. If I gave her something I got for free, it didn’t count as generosity. If she gave me something she got for free, it was an extreme act of generosity.

She is never there for me unless an expensive meal is involved, and even then, would only do easy things, like having her coworker drive, or cut my hair. She repeatedly makes excuses not to be there for anything harder than that.

For about a month before I was making my move to leave the state, she was already looking at Bumble to find a new best friend. Another mutual friend pointed out that it was weird I wasn’t even gone yet and she was already looking for my replacement.

We met up the night before I left the state at her request, and she didn’t want to talk about helping me move, which I told her would be the next morning. I didn’t want to be demanding, so I didn’t make any demands for her to be there, even though she always would with me (like the 3 times to Sacramento). The following day, my family and I worked all day for the move, and she called me at 2:30 PM. I didn’t answer as I was not only busy with the move, but I wasn’t in the mood to talk to her. Later on, others pointed out what a horrible friend she is for not being there, especially with all I have done for her. I tried talking to her about it later. She went on about how she didn’t know the time it was, and she tried calling. She never texted, and she waited well into the afternoon to call. I told her she should have come anyway, but she kept making excuses saying it might have been over. So she waited until she believed it was over to call. I almost never ask her to do anything for me, we always do things for her.

After I was gone, she called me a few times. She was nicer in these calls, and always spoke about “when I come back”. It was also in the last call when we talked about the moving thing. She likely told everyone how I’m so unreasonable to leave her for that alone. Honestly, I was already fed up for months and wanted it to end much sooner. After the last call, she tried calling me almost (if not actually) everyday, but I finally stopped answering. She didn’t call for a week then tried calling on a Saturday morning to my surprise. I finally did what I should have done much sooner and blocked her.

I didn’t calculate everything, but if I did, it would not surprise me if it added up to THOUSANDS that I have spent for her. It’s an extremely generous estimate to say she probably spent about $200 of her own money on me. If you count the meals others have paid by hanging out with both of us, things she got for free, things she bought for herself and decided she didn’t want, etc. it would be an extremely generous estimate to say maybe $500. There are so many other things I haven’t even gotten to, and some I forgot. Looking back, she is definitely the worst friend I ever had. The best part is she seriously believes she is the much better person. And everyone who has met us would probably take her side as she is usually a nice person to them as well as other people she meets. She is far more charismatic and I am far more antisocial. Especially with all the bad things she said about me all the time and I didn’t say bad things about her. She was only horrible to me. My social awkwardness only makes people more take her side as well. Along with how weird I am and how much everyone thinks I’m delusional.

Please don’t say mean things to me. I honestly can’t handle it. I was just sharing a story.",1,1770620600.0,u_Speak-My_Truth,0,1.0,False

He is extremely gentle with them when it comes to play and very tolerant of them munching on his cheeks (see post history for example). The only behavior he exhibits that has us confused is he seems to resource guard not his food, but ours. The cats sometimes snack on his kibble and he has zero problem with this. The issue appears when the cats get too close to dinner/snacks that we have on the table, for example if we have chips and salsa on the coffee table and one of the cats hops over to investigate, he gets kind of pissy and growls until they leave, he never snaps or shows any seriously aggressive behavior but it seems to irritate him. We could leave him alone in the room with food on the table and he wouldn’t touch it because he knows it’s not for him so why does he seem to resource guard?

1qzxdkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenLevelingUp/comments/1qzxdkn/how_to_become_disgustingly_confident_the/,How to Become Disgustingly Confident: The Psychology Behind Actually Changing Your Brain,"Confidence isn't genetic. It's not something certain people are just born with while the rest of us struggle. I used to think that too, scrolling through social media watching people who seemed so effortlessly sure of themselves. Turns out, after diving deep into research, psychology podcasts, and books written by people way smarter than me, confidence is a skill. A learnable, practicable skill. And I'm here to share what actually works because most advice out there is recycled garbage that doesn't address the real problem.

Here's what nobody tells you: Your brain is literally wired to keep you small and scared. It's called the negativity bias, our brains evolved to focus on threats and dangers to keep us alive. Back when we were cavemen, this made sense. Now? It just makes us catastrophize every social interaction and replay embarrassing moments from 2015 at 2am. Combine that with a society that profits off your insecurity, constant comparison on social media, and a culture that equates your worth with your productivity, and no wonder we're all walking around feeling inadequate.

But here's the good news: once you understand how this works, you can rewire it.

**Stop waiting to feel confident before you act.** This is the biggest mistake people make. Confidence doesn't come BEFORE action, it comes AFTER. You build it by doing the thing you're scared of, seeing that you survived, and your brain goes ""oh ok, that wasn't so bad."" Repeat this enough times and suddenly you're confident. Psychologist Susan Jeffers talks about this extensively. The action creates the feeling, not the other way around.

I started with tiny things. Ordering coffee without rehearsing my order 47 times. Speaking up in meetings even when my voice shook. Posting something online without editing it to death. Each small win compounds.

**Challenge your negative self talk like your life depends on it.** Because honestly, your quality of life does depend on it. Dr. Kristin Neff's research on self compassion is wild, she found that people who treat themselves kindly are actually MORE motivated and resilient, not less. Read ""Self Compassion: The Proven Power of Being Kind to Yourself"" by Kristin Neff. She's a pioneering researcher at UT Austin and this book completely changed how I talk to myself. It's packed with practical exercises and backed by 20+ years of research. The main idea? Treat yourself like you'd treat a good friend. When you mess up, instead of spiraling into ""I'm such an idiot,"" try ""Yeah that sucked, but everyone makes mistakes."" Sounds simple but it's genuinely life changing. This is hands down the best book on building unshakeable self worth I've ever encountered.

**Your body language literally changes your brain chemistry.** Amy Cuddy's research on power posing shows that standing in a confident posture for just two minutes increases testosterone and decreases cortisol. Stand tall, take up space, uncross your arms. Your brain gets the message and starts producing the chemicals that make you FEEL confident. It's basically biohacking your own nervous system.

**Track your wins obsessively.** Our brains are designed to remember failures way more than successes because again, survival. You need to actively counteract this. I use the Finch app for this, it's a self care app where you have a little bird that grows as you complete daily habits and log wins. Sounds cutesy but it genuinely helps because you're creating a visual record of all the things you're doing right. You can log compliments you received, things you're proud of, moments you pushed past fear. When you're feeling like trash, you have actual evidence that you're capable.

If you want to go deeper but don't have the time or energy to read through all these books and research, there's BeFreed. It's a smart learning app built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google that pulls from books like Neff's work, psychology research, and expert insights to create personalized audio content. 

You type in your specific goal, like ""build genuine confidence as someone who overthinks everything,"" and it generates a structured learning plan with podcasts tailored to your situation. You control the depth too, from 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. Plus there's this avatar called Freedia you can actually talk to about your struggles, and it recommends content based on what it learns about you. The voice options are legitimately addictive, there's everything from a calm, therapeutic tone to a sarcastic one that makes dense psychology way more digestible during your commute.

**Consume content from people who actually know what they're talking about.** I'm obsessed with Dr. K's HealthyGamerGG YouTube channel. He's a Harvard trained psychiatrist who breaks down confidence, social anxiety, and mental health in the most accessible way. His video on ""How to Stop Caring What People Think"" genuinely shifted something in my brain. He explains the neuroscience behind why we're so desperate for approval and gives actual techniques to break free from it.

For the enneagram nerds, check out ""The Road Back to You"" by Ian Morgan Cron. Understanding your personality type and core fears is insanely helpful for building authentic confidence. You stop trying to be confident in ways that don't fit who you are. The book won multiple awards and Cron is hilarious, it reads more like a conversation with a wise friend than a dense psychology textbook.

Real talk: building confidence is uncomfortable as hell. You have to be willing to look stupid, to fail, to sit with the anxiety of putting yourself out there. But the alternative, staying small and safe and never actually living, is so much worse.

Start small. Act anyway. Be kind to yourself when you mess up. Repeat.

You're not broken. You're not uniquely flawed. You're just human, dealing with a brain that's trying to protect you in ways that no longer serve you. The most confident version of yourself is already in there, you just have to practice letting them out.",1,1770620250.0,MenLevelingUp,0,1.0,False
1qzxd29,https://v.redd.it/qkxrdyrt2fig1,Shot stopper for Lelit Elizabeth,"I’ve just finished a DIY shot-stopper for a Lelit Elizabeth and wanted to share the experience and get some feedback.

The machine uses a Gicar controller with 12V button logic. Each button routes 12V into Gicar’s input. 

In general mod is pretty easy - you just need to place optocouplers between buttons and “brain”. 

Button presses are read and simulated via optocouplers, fully isolated, so the ESP32 never touches the machine electrically.

Unfortunately I didn’t manage to find suitable power output on Gicar side, so I had to add an additional 220V AC to 3.3V DC converter. 

Both brew buttons are handled independently:

\- single shot mode

\- double shot mode (The coffee is split into two cups, while weight is measured on one cup only)

Each one can be detected and emulated separately, so manual control and flushing still work as expected.

Weight is measured using a homebrew ESP32-based scale (but will also work with almost any known BLE scales like Acaia/Bookoo/etc).

I mainly went this route for fun and because I didn’t feel like spending an extra $100+, and would rather put that money into good beans 🙂

Shot stopping is based on weight data and linear regression on recent samples, mostly based by tatemazer’s shotStopper (many thanks to him for all his work and open sourcing everything), to predict the stop point instead of reacting exactly at the target weight.

The tricky part was tuning the button polling interval, but afterwards everything is stable:

\- no false button detections

\- no missed presses

\- works with long preinfusion

\- repeatable stop accuracy

Next step would be probably making a proper PCB (right now it’s still a wired prototype) and play with pressure profiling using a “pump dimmer mod” also controlled via esp32. 

Would love to hear feedback, ideas for improvements, or whether anyone would actually want a board like this.

1qzxcc9,https://i.redd.it/7mey7xwp2fig1.jpeg,"Seriously, why do you want a ""meaning"" in the first place?","""I'm sad because life is pointless.""

Why do you need a point at all?

Coffee tastes good and sex feels good. You can set all kinds of short-term and long-term goals to make your life rewarding. 

So no, **you are not unhappy because of nihilism**. 

You are unhappy because there's something wrong in your life that prevents you from being happy: your lifestyle, your living environment, your health, or your brain chemistry. 

If you feel like you need a magical, inherent, cosmic ""meaning"" to be fulfilled, chances are you won't be happy even when such a meaning exists. 

The reward cycle in your brain, for one reason or another, is preventing you from gaining the healthy level of happiness from normal activities. ",19,1770620134.0,nihilism,6,0.83,False

Chapter 1 

I had been Don Romano’s consigliere for years. I had taken knives meant for him, served prison time for him, and even used my body to draw out poison when someone drugged him. 

When his new mistress was kidnapped by our enemies, I was the one he sent as the hostage in 

exchange. 

Everyone believed I was hopelessly in love with Vincenzo. He claimed he would marry me someday as compensation. 

But after I returned from seven days and seven nights of torture, covered in wounds and barely 

alive, Vincenzo slid the severance agreement across the mahogany desk. 

“Angelina and I are getting married. You can get out.” 

He had deceived me again. 

I didn’t cry or shout. I stood rooted, my face a mask of practiced indifference. I had been chained up 

for a full week while people scrambled to gather the ten-million-dollar ransom. 

When they finally released me, I walked back into the office just in time to see Vincenzo had 

Angelina pressed against the glass, his hands possessive. 

“Baby, that pink diamond necklace you liked is yours now. Nothing worth fussing over.” 

I stood at the door, expression flat. So this was his plan all along. He wanted me to suffer longer at 

the hands of those kidnappers. 

The bone screws still embedded in my knees, the whip marks across my back, the knife scars on my 

hands were still all pulsed with fresh pain. 

But it didn’t matter. I was about to step out quietly when a cold voice cut through the room. 

“Stop.” Vincenzo glanced at me briefly. “There’s a new café downstairs. Angelina wants coffee. Get 

her a damn espresso. Now.” 

His tone held the same practiced authority as always. My nod was just as automatic. 

I returned carrying twenty cups of different flavors, my face was bloodless. 

Angelina had already put her clothes back on, though her blouse hung wide open to flaunt the trail of kiss marks along her neck. 

The hand holding the coffee bags trembled slightly, and beneath my sleeve, half-healed scabs peeked through. 

Chapter 1 

“Too slow. They’re. Angelina complained lazily. 

After I reheated them, she picked up a cup and pretended to fumble it. The burning liquid splashed across my open wounds. She shrieked in feigned surprise. 

Hearing the noise, Vincenzo rushed over. His eyes skimmed right past me and went straight to Angelina with concern. “Did it burn you?” 

She nodded pitifully. Vincenzo tipped the cup slowly, letting the dark liquid ruin my silk blouse. “You can’t even handle something this simple, Livia? This is your punishment.” 

The liquid streamed down my hair and into my eyes, blurring my vision. For a moment, I could barely make out his furious face. 

Two seconds passed. I lowered my head voluntarily. “I’m 

sorry.” 

Even with my apology, his expression somehow grew colder. 

That night, Vincenzo had a banquet to attend. I used to be the only one accompanying him to every 

event and negotiation. But this time, he brought Angelina along. 

He must have truly adored her. 

While choosing my dress, I deliberately picked a long-sleeved gown to cover the wounds. Vincenzo frowned. “Why are you wrapped up like that?” 

Before I could answer, he waved it off. “Forget it. You’re only here as Angelina’s background piece 

anyway. You don’t need to put on a show the way you used to.” 

The ballroom was packed with people clinking glasses and flattering Vincenzo. Angelina hid behind him like a timid little rabbit. “Darling, I can’t drink…”. 

Vincenzo soothed her gently. “It’s fine, sweetheart. Someone will drink for you.” 

I stayed silent and accepted glass after glass of wine and champagne offered by our partners. I used 

to drink only for Vincenzo. Now I drank for Angelina too, 

My stomach felt like it was on fire, twisting in painful spasms. 

When I winced slightly, Vincenzo caught it immediately. “You’ve always been a heavy drinker. This is only a few dozen glasses. Don’t tell me you’re turning useless.” 

Across from me, a fat-bellied man laughed. “Exactly. Livia’s drinking reputation is legendary in Catania. Or are you disrespecting me?” 

Vincenzo’s expression didn’t shift. “Livia, apologize to Mr. Bennett. If he isn’t satisfied tonight, don’t bother showing up tomorrow.” 

Chapter 1 

a beautiful companion, why don’t you lend Livia to me for the night?” 

Vincenzo tightened his arm around Angelina and fixed his eyes on me. 

“Livia, what do you think?” 

“Whatever you decide. I don’t object.” I whispered. 

Vincenzo’s face darkened. He suddenly slammed his glass against the table and walked out without looking back.

Vincenzo’s expression didn’t shift. “Livia, apologize to Mr. Bennett. If he isn’t satisfied tonight, don’t bother showing up tomorrow.” 

Chapter 1 

a beautiful companion, why don’t you lend Livia to me for the night?” 

Vincenzo tightened his arm around Angelina and fixed his eyes on me. 

“Livia, what do you think?” 

“Whatever you decide. I don’t object.” I whispered. 

Vincenzo’s face darkened. He suddenly slammed his glass against the table and walked out without looking back.

Chapter 1 

I had been Don Romano’s consigliere for years. I had taken knives meant for him, served prison time for him, and even used my body to draw out poison when someone drugged him. 

When his new mistress was kidnapped by our enemies, I was the one he sent as the hostage in 

exchange. 

Everyone believed I was hopelessly in love with Vincenzo. He claimed he would marry me someday as compensation. 

But after I returned from seven days and seven nights of torture, covered in wounds and barely 

alive, Vincenzo slid the severance agreement across the mahogany desk. 

“Angelina and I are getting married. You can get out.” 

He had deceived me again. 

I didn’t cry or shout. I stood rooted, my face a mask of practiced indifference. I had been chained up 

for a full week while people scrambled to gather the ten-million-dollar ransom. 

When they finally released me, I walked back into the office just in time to see Vincenzo had 

Angelina pressed against the glass, his hands possessive. 

“Baby, that pink diamond necklace you liked is yours now. Nothing worth fussing over.” 

I stood at the door, expression flat. So this was his plan all along. He wanted me to suffer longer at 

the hands of those kidnappers. 

The bone screws still embedded in my knees, the whip marks across my back, the knife scars on my 

hands were still all pulsed with fresh pain. 

But it didn’t matter. I was about to step out quietly when a cold voice cut through the room. 

“Stop.” Vincenzo glanced at me briefly. “There’s a new café downstairs. Angelina wants coffee. Get 

her a damn espresso. Now.” 

His tone held the same practiced authority as always. My nod was just as automatic. 

I returned carrying twenty cups of different flavors, my face was bloodless. 

Angelina had already put her clothes back on, though her blouse hung wide open to flaunt the trail of kiss marks along her neck. 

The hand holding the coffee bags trembled slightly, and beneath my sleeve, half-healed scabs peeked through. 

Chapter 1 

“Too slow. They’re. Angelina complained lazily. 

After I reheated them, she picked up a cup and pretended to fumble it. The burning liquid splashed across my open wounds. She shrieked in feigned surprise. 

Hearing the noise, Vincenzo rushed over. His eyes skimmed right past me and went straight to Angelina with concern. “Did it burn you?” 

She nodded pitifully. Vincenzo tipped the cup slowly, letting the dark liquid ruin my silk blouse. “You can’t even handle something this simple, Livia? This is your punishment.” 

The liquid streamed down my hair and into my eyes, blurring my vision. For a moment, I could barely make out his furious face. 

Two seconds passed. I lowered my head voluntarily. “I’m 

sorry.” 

Even with my apology, his expression somehow grew colder. 

That night, Vincenzo had a banquet to attend. I used to be the only one accompanying him to every 

event and negotiation. But this time, he brought Angelina along. 

He must have truly adored her. 

While choosing my dress, I deliberately picked a long-sleeved gown to cover the wounds. Vincenzo frowned. “Why are you wrapped up like that?” 

Before I could answer, he waved it off. “Forget it. You’re only here as Angelina’s background piece 

anyway. You don’t need to put on a show the way you used to.” 

The ballroom was packed with people clinking glasses and flattering Vincenzo. Angelina hid behind him like a timid little rabbit. “Darling, I can’t drink…”. 

Vincenzo soothed her gently. “It’s fine, sweetheart. Someone will drink for you.” 

I stayed silent and accepted glass after glass of wine and champagne offered by our partners. I used 

to drink only for Vincenzo. Now I drank for Angelina too, 

My stomach felt like it was on fire, twisting in painful spasms. 

When I winced slightly, Vincenzo caught it immediately. “You’ve always been a heavy drinker. This is only a few dozen glasses. Don’t tell me you’re turning useless.” 

Across from me, a fat-bellied man laughed. “Exactly. Livia’s drinking reputation is legendary in Catania. Or are you disrespecting me?”

Booked straight the Executive Suite, and didn’t want to rely on eStandby upgrades clearing. Other room was booked as “King Deluxe” and upgraded to “King Premium” the previous day of arrival. The upgrade could be seen on the app. Both rooms were booked directly with Hilton, and as Gold members the breakfast was included. Also some drinks vouchers were given at check in.

The room is in good condition, and I like how light the design is kept. There is even some art piece and paintings in the suites. Bed is big and comfortable! DoubleTree cookies are yummy, and some Gold member coconut chips were delivered to our room shortly after settling in.

Breakfast is great, and so far didn’t eat anything bad. Some local options are found, but there are plenty of western food options too. Cook to order egg station is a nice one too. Coffee is pretty good, as somewhere it can taste a bit burnt.

It’s not a luxury hotel, but it’s a really nice and comfortable one. No one is there to kiss it you know where, but everyone is very friendly and ready to help, if anything is needed. Oh, and you can just send a message on WhatsApp, if you need anything! The Executive Suite doesn’t come with Lounge Access, as the hotel lacks one. There is a lobby bar, and a restaurant, where the breakfast is served too. I really like the space as it’s open and airy. People seem to enjoy spending time there!

The Executive Suite seems to be priced about the same, as the most basic room at Conrad next door. I think the breakfast is pretty much the same, maybe even better than at Conrad. The hotel doesn’t have a Lounge, and there is no minibus to the BTS station. So if those are important to you, then I’d suggest staying in the Conrad. Other than that, the hotel and the rooms are in better condition, the service just might lack some ‘luxury’.",9,1770619540.0,Hilton,1,0.81,False
