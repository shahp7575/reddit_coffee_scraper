1o18wpg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o18wpg,Follow-up To My Post Below about Multiple Pinholes,"So here is the ""best"" result that I have come up with so far using a coffee can with seven pinholes in the shape of a hexagon, with an additional pinhole in the center. I went out late afternoon - 5:30 or so, and there were light clouds in the sky. So not bright, but not dusky at all.

I metered at f/22 and ISO 100 and got a reading of 1/4 second. Multiplied this by the factor of 102 (from the pinhole designer with one 0.4mm pinhole and 3/5"" focal length), and then divided that by 7 (for the seven pinholes), and rounded down to 3 seconds. I exposed for approximately that amount of time.

If you zoom in, you can see that I did get something of an image ...

Also shown is a front, back, and bottom view of the camera - pretty sealed up.

I'm going to give it one more go in pretty dusky conditions, and then maybe consider it a failed experiment.

I will scan this and invert it to see what it looks like then.",1,1759926048.0,PinholePhotography,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1o18tdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o18tdb/willys_wonderstore_1/,Willy's Wonderstore (1),"Hey r/nosleep  
Posting this from the breakroom at my workplace, just call me Nate (technically Nate Jr., blame my Mum), it's around 6:30pm, probably 8pm when I'll post this, I guess it's a whole run of random thoughts for me, so things will be a bit disjointed.

To start with, I am (as of now) the ADM (Assistant Department Manager) of the Front End of Willy's Wonderstore, a local branch of supermarkets in my home state of Queensland. (Yes, I'm Aussie.)  
Used to work for the bigger chains when I was around 14, quickly realised all the big claims of ""Family"" were manipulative tactics by the time I had my first drink at 16. (Best night of my life, if I'm honest, gotta miss the days of high school sometimes... even if my friends and I broke the law.)  
Shortly after that, I was without a job, home was a mess, mum couldn't handle all the stress alone, sending me to school and working a 7 day job, so I had to find a new job for myself, real quick, without the issue of corporate manipulation looming over my shoulder.

That's where Willy's Wonderstore came in, it was a local brand, reputable, small. Living in a low income house with my widowed mum, I of course jumped at the chance to work for them, skip forward a whole 7 years and I'm a scruffy 23yr old employee who still hasn't climbed the corporate ladder. Pay's good, mum was able to quit her shitty job, since I was able to pay off the debts she'd racked up after dad left us and this world.

Only reason I explain this, is so that you know why I can't just hand in my two weeks and quit.

But that's enough of me, I should explain why I am posting this and asking for your advice and help. I started my ADM position about 2 months back, around the time our PDM Rebbeca was in her third trimester and forced to go on maternity leave. Woman had to be told by the store managed to go on leave, or he'd fire her, she loved the Front End, meeting people, but I could not imagine the strain she must have been in, hence why she was forced to take time off.

So, with her being put on limited time and me being added as her second in command, I was trained and then given the expectation to take over from her for the time she's gone (I doubt it's a short time, her husband was an amputee, real bad car crash, so he was wheelchair bound. Great guy though, killer stories about his time in the air force. So taking care of a baby is gonna run them both ragged), which included doing one of the strangest tasks you could think a check-out worker would have to do- opening and closing the store at night.

Willy's operates on a more lax schedule, we open at 10am sharp, every morning, close at 6pm, regardless of weekday or weekend (on holidays we stay open until 9pm.). But then, we open back up at 11pm until 4am every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The Manager calls it 'Graveyard Trading Hours', payrates are doubled and it's a pretty sweet deal. At least, that's what I was thinking, at first.

Part of Rebbeca's duties was starting at 12pm and at the end of the shift, having us close up at 6pm and then returning at 11pm to open up again, with the now ex ADM, Kyle, closing at 4am. Only reason she was needed was to verify headcount, so that no one was trying to pretend to be a member of staff, or sneak in a shift on the rather gullible shift system for a quick and easy buck at double the rate.

Me, though, I fulfil both their roles, I arrive at work at 11:50am sharp and then clock in at 11:54am. I just find the early start helps me figure out what the day is going to be like, what stock is on hand, the usual.

I work on front end, keep the staff members in line, sell liquor and other 18+ stuff to the occasional customer, usually met with grunts and growls about the need for ID, the average crap that you get being on the main counter. After that, around closing time (5:30pm), we take out the trash from any of the registers, if you work in retail, you know the drill, send one of the juniors off with the trash bags to chuck them into the dumpster out back near the loading bay.

Then, I take my copy of the store keys and bring down the roller doors, leaving only the one next to the express register open so the nightfill team can herd any confused customers out (usually the elderly who can't really tell the time while in a grocery store) through it. Once all the customers are gone, I close the last roller door, say goodnight to the nightfill ADM, Sarah and let the Front End team out through the exit door on the dock. By the end of that, it is usually 6:10pm, then I have to perform a 20 minute double take on our store's security footage, for anything that comes up on the security cameras. (They have a program on them that puts a highlight on anything that does not line up at the Front End.)

Trawling through hazy freezeframes, I have to label them under different categories, whether they are considered to be of concern, a scan that didn't go through or even shoplifting an item. Half the time it's just the camera bugging out because someone bought something from somewhere else and has it in their trolley.

By 6:30pm, I save all the categories into a folder for the Store Manager, David, to look through when he opens in the morning at 10am. I then stay back until 7pm, having to check through my team's statistics (contract hours, any duty limitations, workplace notices on behaviour.)

Now, due to my task as ADM, on any of the days we don't have the bizarre night trading hours, it's just a simple 7hr shift, I come in just before 12, finish at 7 and go home to my mum and our black cat, Coal.  
But for Monday, Wednesday and Friday, the schedule changes, come in early, keep the team in check, work until 6, then close the roller doors and let the team out. But instead of staying back, I myself have to leave at 6pm too, as I am expected to return in 5hrs to reopen the store.

What I do, on those nights, is that I will head home (a good 25 minute walk to our quaint family home) and take a 3hr power nap, usually with Coal laying his plump, fuzzy mass on top of my neck like a scarf. Mum then will wake me up, as she is about to go to bed, usually scooping up the pudgy black cat as she goes and I will take a quick hot shower and swap my work hat and shirt, to feel fresh. Then I walk back to work, usually grabbing a small bite to eat on the way from one of the local fast food places on the route to Willy's.

By the time I am back at Willy's Wonderstore, the nightfill team will be packing up and heading home, with Sarah and I inverting our farewell, where I wave goodbye to her, instead of her doing so. I will note that I am not alone, during this time, as I am accompanied by team members from what David calls ""The Graveyard Shift"", they don't talk much, mostly keep to themselves and seem to focus solely on scanning items, droning out responses and packing bags. I can understand the feeling, though, they are having to do night shift and check-out work, it's not too fun to combine too rather dreary tasks into one.

The customers we get at night aren't the worst, as we live in a decently small country town, mostly stoners, angsty teens, stressed out college kids and the rare nutcase that come through. Once we get near 4am, I then do the usual closing up procedure, roller doors, trash and footage, along with reports.

What I could not understand, though, is that the cameras would sometimes affix on random customers the other staff serve, usually focusing on the oddest of spots, like the neck flab of a man in a mobility scooter, or the broken arm of a wannabe punk artist. As I've said, the footage is hazy, so I don't understand why the cameras do it, meaning that I have to write those off as simple irrelevancy.

But, besides the bizarre customers and dreary co-workers, the late night trade pays well and goes by quickly. At least, it used to be, until last Monday.

Last Monday marked the start of it getting cold over here, real cold... Fog, cold dribbles of rain, dry winds and the usual prelude to winter. It also marked the night shift getting a lot less breezy.

I entered through the back, being waved at by Sarah as I turned left into the stockroom and walked past the shelves of overstocked items, heading for the staff breakroom and offices just on the other side. I'd gotten a chicken burger meal on the way, it was steaming hot, so I was a bit slower than my usual brisk pace, especially being rugged up in at least three layers. What was especially different was that after waving, I heard Sarah call to me. I looked back, seeing that she had been trying to wave me over, rather than wave goodbye.

Turning on my heels, I headed back to her, she looked a bit spooked, I then noticed her team had headed home early, from the looks of it, the night's load still had at least 2 pallets remaining (they were T3s, for anyone that is interested, soft drink and energy drinks.). I can clearly remember how our exchange went, as usually I was the one to get a conversation started, but this time, Sarah spoke first:

'Nate, I'm gonna be staying back tonight for a bit, alright? Apparently some weirdo was lingering at the roller doors, staring at team members. I'll be clocked off, but I want you to keep your earpiece on you.'

I shrugged, but then nodded.

'Alright, you want me to tell the other team members to keep an eye out?'

She seemed to flinch when I mentioned the team, which caused me to frown, why was she wanting me to keep information about a possible person that needed blacklisting from my team?

'No, I don't think that'd be best, it's just... a hunch, I guess.'

'You're not one for hunches, though.'

I'd known Sarah since I started at the store, her and I were part of the same hiring pool, started same day, we'd built a decent work friendship, it was unlike her to act this way, more to keep anything to herself when it came to her thoughts.

'I can't say... just follow me.'

Sarah didn't budge, instead deciding to drag me off like a lost child to the communications office.

At our work place, there are two offices, David's Office, where meetings are held and paperwork is kept, then there is the Communications Office, where we store two outdated PCs, our singular printer and the charging dock for our walkies and earpieces, it is also where you have to clock in on the computer, entering payroll number and your personalised password. Both offices are the only rooms in the staff only area that have locks besides the back door and loading bay roller door.

Sarah handed me an earpiece, the mess of wires having to be untangled in my one free hand so the power source could clip onto my belt and the tiny audio receiver could clip to my work shirt's breast pocket. The earpiece itself looping around my ear and the speaker dangling just above the eardrum.

'Listen, I just need you to be my eyes and ears out there, alright? I can do the reports and footage for you, as long as you let me stay in the main office. Don't let the others know I'm here.'

Sarah definitely was acting strange, evasive, without a moment for me to even ask what the hell she was on about, the lock clicked on the door to David's office, leaving me alone for the next five minutes.

Usually, if I had the time, I'd have looked at what we had stored in the overstock shelves, but the now lukewarm burger beckoned to me, as I felt my body yearn for some sustenance. I obliged it and quickly stored away my clothing in my work locker, still keeping at least a jacket and scarf on me, having to fiddle with my name badge to get it to click onto my jacket instead of my shirt. As I stepped out of the men's locker room, I then heard the far off noise of my co-workers cars pulling into the parking spaces.

Sarah was silent on the communication channel, even as I did a headcount on the mopey crew I called my teammates, though I could have sworn one looked slightly confused at me. If they had tried to speak, though, it seems they didn't see the point in bothering.

All went normal, or as normal as serving the odd and zany could be. It was around 1am that I heard Sarah on the earpiece, seems she had gone over to the communications office once the other team members had clocked in, I could hear the whirring of the overtaxed fan within one of the PCs on her end.

'Register 3, man in a mobility scooter, back of his neck.'

It was a surprise to hear her, but I made sure to show little sign of reacting, hiding the surprise with the realisation that I had not refilled the drink fridges on the registers, something that gave me an excuse to go past Register 3.

Registers 1 and 2 had fully stocked beverages, but 3 had been decently emptied, a good amount of traffic having passed through, the current customer being served was a rather obese man on a mobility scooter. I didn't judge people's weight, but internally, I did feel sorry for how his joints must be, at least, until I caught sight of the back of his neck, right at the nape. I didn't understand what I saw, at least, not immediately.

'What do you see?'

Sarah asked, I didn't respond, I averted my gaze and placed the drinks in according order. Though I think the customer noticed, as a rumbling voice came to my attention, a thick lisp to his voice.

'Excoose me, do you hath sum shashparella?'

I looked down to the crate of drinks in my hands, I did indeed, so I handed one to him, but he seemed disappointed.

'Maw pweash'

I offered the crate and he beamed like a child on Christmas day. He took all of them, which, in my honest opinion, was financially wasteful, a 350ml bottle of sars from us runs you $3.50 per bottle, he had taken at least 23 of them, minus the one I had put on the shelf of the drink fridge. The server shot a death stare at me, as she had to put more items in more bags for her customer, but the customer himself was quite happy, he turned back, nestling back into his scooter.

The first time I saw it, I didn't understand, but now... now I saw that what were at first glance rolls of skin, were in fact lips, pale, but with the occasional, thick tongue poking out to lick and slather the area with drool. I went stiff, as I then turned and walked.

I wish I was someone who experienced fear like the typical person, but whenever I get scared, I get stiff and cold, the polar opposite to an adrenaline rush. Luckily, though, it seemed no one noticed. The store was otherwise quiet, not even a minute after what had happened at Register 3, I clocked off for a 15 minute break.

Getting to the breakroom was a blessing, it was warm, ten times better than the shop floor, but even better was being able to lock myself in the Communications Office with Sarah, after I gave her a quick message on the comms channel.

'I saw it, let me in.'

The Communications Office was really warm, the PCs had been warming up a lot, and Sarah was looking expectantly at me.

'Well?'

She leaned against the dirty white plastic case of the printer.

'Well... the man had...'

Sarah stared expectantly at me, I felt like I was being pranked.

'This is a prank, isn't it?'

I decided to ask, Sarah looked offended, then concerned.

'Nathan, this is not a prank, tell me, now.'

I was unsure, I doubted her, but I answered honestly.

'I don't know... lips? And tongues?'

Sarah stared through me, as if I wasn't there, then she turned to the PC, pointing at multiple reports from prior nights I had worked as Front End Manager on. There that same man in the mobility scooter was, each time, the cameras pointed to his neck.

'I still don't know what this has to do with that mentioned weirdo.'

She didn't respond, instead just pulling up a grainy and dark image, from much earlier, during her shift, same body shape, but not sitting on his scooted... rather, he was standing on what almost looked like a blob of flesh, like a slug.

I shook my head.

'It's too late for this... he's probably some weirdo looking to freak people out with practical effects, some people do that.'

I didn't believe myself, I wanted to, but there was no way that what I saw could make sense in any way but the supernatural.

'Well, how about this, you get no other weird customer until 3am, I leave. Sound good?'

Sarah gave a decent ultimatum, it was about 1:36am, at that time, I'd be back on the floor at 1:45am. I nodded and then exited the office. I heard her relock it behind me.

I had a poor quality cup of instant noodles, before I got back onto the floor, heading back to my spot of work, the main counter.

Any activity in the store had crawled to a snail's pace, only got one customer through, a confused driver asking for directions, as we were the only place open in the center of town. He was nice enough, came along to visit his Grandpa in the nearby town.

It was at 2:55am that it came into the store.

On first glance, you would think it was the average drug addict, scraggly hair, wrinkled skin, rotted teeth, attitude to match. But it was when it came to my register that I found it to be anything but. It looked like a woman, probably late 50s, a bit younger than my own mum, but without any of the graceful aging she had been granted.

'Twenty ciggies now. My uuuuuusual.'

I'm used to customers being rude or impatient, but I had no clue on what their usual meant, so I responded as would be expected.

'Sorry? What type do you take?'

It's bony fingers tensed into balled fists as it smacked the counter, screaming like a banshee.

'THE BLUE ONES!!!'

I froze, to it, I stood still and stared back, but internally, I was assessing the threat they posed. If they jumped the counter, I had good chances of escaping, due to how high it is, if they tried to punch me from there, I could move back. So, I took a breath in and tried to deescalate the situation.

'Ma'am, I need a brand name, please, there's no need to get aggressive.'

It shook, then, to my silent and unflinching horror, mashed it's face into the counter. I heard something crack, then something rip, but not in the way you'd expect meat to, but instead how rubber would.

'I... I just want some Earls Blues, darling.'

Its neck had bent like a rubber hose, craning to the side at a sharp 180 degree turn, their face was contorted and flattened by the impact, like a clay sculpture being pressed down while still wet. I now could also tell that the skin had a leathery texture to it, with a rather grey tone, utterly inhuman.

I was terrified, but I did as it asked, grabbed the brand it wanted, was handed a pair of $50 bills, they didn't even stay for me giving them the change, instead giggling like a lunatic as they hopped out the exit of the store with the cigarette carton cupped in their hands. When all went quiet, I looked to the registers, none of my co-workers had looked up.

The rest of the night went by slowly, at least, until the trash run came. This time, I chose to take the trash myself, letting my dour co-workers shuffle off to the back room to restock the snacks section of their registers.

I hadn't heard from Sarah until I went to do the trash run, she probably saw me doing the preparations.

'Meet you at the dock, act like I came in to check in.'

I've never been one to waste time, but I spent a solid 10 minutes outside, in silence, with Sarah keeping to the shadow cast by the dumpster. I had thrown the bags in, but I just needed to be near an actual human, after what I had seen.

'I saw what happened.'

I didn't respond. She knew that my reaction to trauma, fear and tension was to internalise it and to freeze up.

'I'll give you a lift home, would your old lady lets me crash on the couch?'

I nodded. Had been since I was 15 that I had someone sleep over, but I think her and I were both too spooked to want to venture into the night alone. But we didn't have enough time to be talking, so I swallowed my fear and headed back inside, with Sarah in tow.

Closing up procedure went easily, but the co-workers stared at Sarah, despite her given reason, that she was doing the last two pallets before the morning load came in. I had to actively yell at one to move from his station, to which he grunted and turned away. I got a worrying hunch that I was best to keep Sarah and the Graveyard Shift separate.

Finally, it was home time, the Graveyard Shift filtered out and it was just me and Sarah. Filing reports and finishing up the pallets was easy enough, she gave me a spare box cutter so I could actually break the tape. I also learnt how to unload a cardboard bailer, it was pretty fun.

After all the clean up, it was 4:23am, everything was filed away and tidied up. Not the best end time, but for a night where the night fill team was lacking some people, we made good progress.

It was as Sarah and I headed for her ute that I witnessed something that I wish I had not seen. It was the entity that had verbally assaulted me and broke its neck earlier, rummaging through the dumpster. For a brief moment, I caught it's gaze, as it munched on receipt papers as if it was a horse eating grass. It had too many teeth, but I saw that it smiled.

The drive back home was uneventful, thankfully, but I did notice that Sarah kept looking back to me, worried, as if I was going to just vanish.

When we got home, I accidentally woke mum up, Coal was still fast asleep, but at least Sarah was welcomed to stay the night, she didn't have work the following work day. She was set up next to the fire place and given a bunch of blankets, alongside the three person couch, safe to say, I was jealous, seemed extra cosy compared to my own room.

Getting to sleep was hard, practically impossible, before I knew it, it was 8am and Coal was scratching at my door for his morning snuggles. I got two hours of sleep, thanks to the affectionate blob of fur that is that cat, I think Mum and Sarah got chatting in the meantime.

By the time I was up, it was 10:25am and I had work in an hour and a half. Sadly meaning I could not hang around for long, having to dose myself with as much coffee as I could handle and treat myself to a quick hot shower before throwing on the work gear I had worn just the night prior. I didn't feel like ironing it, not after the night prior.

Today went by with no issue, luckily it was Tuesday, so Kyle was doing the promo ends, meaning Front End got some fancy new magazines to advertise to customers. It also means I don't need to stay back. But when it came to closing time, I decided to do a quick lap of the store.

I came up empty handed, half expected my curiosity to be rewarded with the cigarette obsessed thing running at me from around the corner like a possessed maniac. Instead, I just found sleepy pigeons huddling in the old vents for warmth and a single homeless man, who I gave $5, as he usually busks during the day inside the shopping center our store is attached to.

Now I'm here, wasting away unpaid time, typing this all down. I checked the clock and realised it's almost 9pm. I'll have to get going, keep getting the occasional weird look from members of night fill for staying back so late to type this down on one of the computers.

Sarah is going to pick me up, I think it's going to be safer that way, at least, at night.  
I've had to tell her a couple times that I will be late and she should just wait for me to call, so best for me to finish this. I think Kyle especially is annoyed, but he left at 4pm, after setting up the ends, he's now the Grocery ADM, not sure what by, though. I should probably ask him for advice, shouldn't I? But can I trust him to believe that I saw some sort of slug man and a rubbery psycho junkie?

I'll put an end to this post now, but please, give me advice on how I can deal with any of this, if you believe me. I feel like I'm up a creek without a paddle.

I'm also up to answering questions, if you're curious about anything, maybe they will lead to answers too.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I am a 30 year old female and I just recently moved into a complex with my kids. I split from their dad a few months ago. When I moved in, I struggled to mount my TV on the wall, so I called the chairperson of the body corperate if he could assist me. He said yes and came over to help. He noticed that my dishwasher was leaking and offered to fix that too. He is a helpful guy. Over the next few weeks he helped me with a few things around the house and we formed a friendship.

Now onto his wife. She's a nice woman, but her personality is the polar opposite of mine. She's introverted and keeps to herself, she doesn't go out at all, except with my friend. She goes to work, and comes home. That's all. They also just had a baby a few months ago. So keeping that in mind, I get along with her husband more than her.

Her husband works from home and I'm a teacher. Schools were closed so ever now and then, I would go by their place and have a cup of coffee with my friend, usually after I've been to the gym. Things were fine, when one day my friend came to my unit and said that I must stop visiting so much, that his wife is uncomfortable that I am always there but only when she is at work. Like really?? They have cameras in the house so it wasn't like I was going behind her back. She texted me to say that as a woman, I should've recognized when the visits became too much, and that it was inappropriate to constantly visit a married man wearing tight and skimpy workout clothes. I told her she needs to stop being insecure and that she must let her husband be friends with other women. That because they are having marital issues is on her because her husband is loyal and she must stop trying to control him. She called me an attention-seeking narcissist and blocked me. My friend also refuses to talk to me now.

My world is falling apart, each moment another test of my abilities to keep my cool and pretend that it's all okay. All towards what?
A better future does not look like it's in site, another challenge, another breakdown most definitely. A better future? Keep dreaming.

Then you came into my world, another girl in a coffee shop. Not intimidated by my size or crass nature. Not turned away by my over sharing and ,oddly, intuitive nature. 
 Just another girl in a coffee shop... may be the biggest lie i have ever tried to tell myself.

You are so, hurt. So unbelievably put upon by those around you. I wish to take that all away. I want to break down those walls that you have erected to find that gleam that flashes across your face when you beat me at chess or pool or Settlers of Catan. A persistence that I know I too posses but is reaffirmed whenever I see it in your blue eyes. So quickly smothered by a fear I cannot comprehend. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm  not here to fix you, make you whole. I just want tobe there, by your side, when that flash breaks free and blinds the world with its brilliance. 

Whenever it is too much I will think of you and that cheeky smile and be reminded that in time I too will break down my walls and allow myself the space to love someone like you with the respect and beauty that I believe  you deserve.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Ever since I was young, my mom has always decided things for me, what to do, where to go, even what kind of job I should take. I grew up thinking that was normal. But after college, when I started making my own choices, I realized how much guilt I felt just for doing things for myself. Even simple things like going out or spending time with friends felt “wrong”, as if I was supposed to always stay home and be the obedient child.

Recently, I had a job change. My assistant role was dissolved after my superior resigned, so I got transferred to a different department. Then, I was offered a similar position again, same role, but for a higher boss this time. I ended up declining it because deep down, I knew I wasn’t fit for it… and honestly, I don’t see myself in corporate long term.

Before that corporate stint, I worked as a seasonal barista at a well-known coffee shop (the green one). That short experience felt so fulfilling compared to the months I’ve spent in a corporate setting. But when the contract ended, my mom immediately pushed me to go corporate, saying it’s more stable and respectable. So I tried it and here I am, realizing it’s not for me.

When she found out I declined the offer, she got disappointed. I didn’t even bother explaining because she’s already made it clear she doesn’t want me going back to being a barista. Every time I try to explain my side, she dismisses it. It’s like she already has my life plan set, and I’m just supposed to follow it.

I know the corporate path is “wise” and “promising,” but being a barista feels right. I feel alive and proud when I do it. I guess it’s just hard to go against what’s “expected” here especially in a family and society where success is always measured by climbing the corporate ladder.

I guess what I’m really asking is:
How do I start rebuilding myself and pursuing what I truly want even when my own family doesn’t support it?",1,1759924965.0,adviceph,1,1.0,False

1o18hev,https://www.reddit.com/r/remoteviewing/comments/1o18hev/did_i_remote_view_or_was_it_something_else/,Did I Remote View Or Was It Something Else?," Approximately 30 years ago, I'm 65 now, I was exploring metaphysics. At that time I was personally going through some changes ie: I had moved to a new city with a new job and had been divorced for a couple of years and coming out of the trauma of that life changing event with optimism. It was a fresh start. I met knew friends at a local coffee shop and afterwork there would be anywhere from two to sometimes eight people gathered almost every evening. We were all single. I felt an attraction to a lady and I strongly believed it was mutual, but I hadn't approached her yet about a date...blah blah blah

Back story...as a child I wasn't anti social, but I did enjoy spending time alone in nature. I had very lucid dreams and sometimes while in nature I would have thoughts, ideas, and maybe visions, or dreams. For example: I stayed outside all one day, came in for lunch, and began to race back outside my mother asked what was in such a hurry about and what I was doing. I told her I was waiting for the helicopter to come pick me up and take me for a ride. I remember the shocked look on her face. Let me express...I knew a helicopter was going to arrive and take me for a ride, but it never came and I was disappointed. To this day I have no idea where that thought came from, but I, even at age 4 or 5, knew I wasn't crazy. I was labeled a ""day dreamer"" by teachers. I was a decent student and very well behaved in school. I generally never got in trouble. People liked me and I liked them, but I did enjoy being alone.

Back to the lady...I had made a decision that the next I saw her at the coffee shop that I was going to asked her out. I was in my apartment and for some reason I was tired from work and found myself laying down early to sleep. Almost immediately as I closed my eyes o seemed to drift off. I was in her apartment that I had never seen I saw the furniture, the color of the walls, and moved into the kitchen where see was standing close to the refrigerator. I gently touched her hair, then suddenly it startled me and i, for lack of a better word, woke up. I thought no more of it until the next day when I saw her at the coffee shop. I was very pleased to see her and began describing this dream I had. She turned ghostly white and ask what color were her walls and I replied, ""yellow"" and laughed. She immediately said when she arrived home she felt strongly someone was in her apartment and angrily said, ""don't ever do that again! I had to stay at a friend's home I was so afraid!"" I laughed and said, ""do what?!"" She stormed away and never spoke to me again.

I'm old and retired now, but for some reason I think I have a gift and want, now that I have the time, to explore things.

Oh, I remember dreaming of a plane crash one night and the next day there was a horrible crash. I also had a very strange thing happen the other night. I can tell when it's a dream while I'm sleeping, or one of these weird things.

That’s why I decided to craft/brew my own Coffee. I bought half a kg lang ata or 1/4kg for ₱180 Coffee beans sa SuperMarket and it lasted for a month. Lol! And the taste! Boy, I’m tellin ya, comparable sa mga coffee tycoons natin. That’s the first perk.

Secondly, crafting your own coffee is a mood booster because it gives u a sense of accomplishment. Thus, a strong reason to keep existing.

1o18h0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1o18h0h/did_my_wife_have_an_emotional_affair_or_was_it/,Did my wife have an emotional affair or was it just a friendship,"Me (39M) and my wife (37F) met in college and have been deeply in love ever since. After 15 years of our relationship and 12 years as married with a 6 year old daughter we still have a very passionate and regular sex life.

Last year was particularly difficult after my mothers death and also in her and my work place due to immense pressure we both were handling. She was in a new leadership role and felt isolated and didnt know whom to share her stress with as she didnt want to add up to my stress.

She made a friendship with a male colleague who was very easy going and she liked that ease as that allowed her to destress. She kept the friendship from me as she knew i wouldn’t approve a close friendship with a male colleague as i have always insisted. She has difficulty making friends due to her nature and finds friendship with men easier.

She made ground rules at the starting itself with him telling him that she was only looking for a friendship as she is very happy in her marital life. Also in the first week she asked him twice “we are just friends right” as she was confused why she felt so good talking to someone. Once she felt safe in the friendship she opened up a lot about our marriage, all the good things and passion we have.

So the friendship deepened and she took the friendship very seriously. Gave him gifts like books and pens. She spoke about our sex life in detail as she felt it was like a guys friendship and she felt like a guy with him. They went out during lunch and sometimes coffee.

But suddenly the colleague reduced talking and once she asked he said he had developed feelings for her. To this she said she didnot feel the safe and loved me too much.

She continued messaging him even though he didnt reply asking him to keep the friendship and get over his feelings and couldn’t stop msging as she was addicted to the relief she felt from talking to him. I caught her through a message i saw in her phone one day and slowly the hidden and secret friendship came to light.

She has completely cut contact and promises will never even talk to a man other than professionally. She is extremely loving to me but i keep wondering if this was just a friendship or an affair.",1,1759924825.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

1o18fz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1o18fz8/the_ai_i_used_didnt_generate_art_it_summoned_jeff/,"The AI I Used Didn’t Generate Art, It Summoned Jeff the Killer","I should’ve known better than to play around with things I didn’t understand.
But when everyone online was messing with those new AI art generators, I figured I’d join in. At first, it was harmless—fun, even. I was never good at drawing, but here I was, typing a few words into a box and watching eerie, detailed images appear in seconds. Monsters, haunted houses, surreal dreamscapes… the AI gave me what I wanted, and more.

I’d stay up late at night, just experimenting. Prompts like: “a monster crawling from a mirror, photorealistic, horror” or “smiling ghost in a dark alley”. The results were fascinating. Sometimes unsettling, sometimes goofy. I laughed at most of them, even shared a few with my friends.

But then… something changed.

It started when I typed a simple prompt: “creepy face in the dark”. The AI spat out an image almost instantly—faster than usual. I thought maybe the servers were running better that night. But when I saw the picture, my stomach dropped.

The face was pale. Skin stretched, almost waxy. Eyes rimmed in black, like the eyelids had been burned away. And the smile… too wide, carved like a wound. I didn’t even have to think. My brain whispered the name before I realized it:

Jeff the Killer.

At first, I laughed nervously. Jeff the Killer was just one of those old internet urban legends—something that circulated when I was a kid. Grainy photos, badly written creepypastas. It wasn’t real.

Still… the AI had nailed it. I hadn’t typed anything close to “Jeff the Killer.” Just creepy face in the dark.

I shrugged it off and typed another prompt: “forest at night, shadowy figure.”
The image processed. And there he was again. Same pale skin, same grin. This time he was half-hidden behind the trees.

Okay, weird coincidence. Algorithms sometimes “latch” onto styles. Maybe someone had trained this model on old creepypasta memes, and Jeff’s face got baked in. I could explain it.

Except… the more I tried, the less sense it made.

No matter what I typed—“abandoned hospital,” “smiling clown,” “old man reading a book”—Jeff’s face showed up somewhere in the image. Sometimes faint, like he was lurking in the shadows. Sometimes front and center, staring directly at me.

By the fifth image, I noticed something else. A thin line of text burned into the bottom corner. Not the AI watermark. Just one word:

Jeff.

At first, I thought maybe I’d accidentally typed it as a prompt. I checked. My last input was “cozy fireplace scene, digital art.” Nothing about Jeff. Yet there he was, crouched in the corner of the fireplace, teeth shining.

I tried again. “Cute kitten, watercolor.”
The AI gave me the kitten. But behind it, blurry but unmistakable, was the smile. And at the bottom, that same word:

Jeff.

I remember pushing my chair back so hard it squealed against the floor. My heart was pounding. This wasn’t funny anymore.

I closed the program, shut off my laptop, and went to bed.

The next morning, I tried to forget about it. Maybe it was just a glitch. Maybe someone had slipped a “Jeff filter” into the model as a joke. AI tools are weird sometimes. I went about my day—classes, coffee, scrolling Reddit.

That night, though, curiosity got the better of me. I turned my laptop back on. Opened the AI app. My recent renders were still saved in my gallery. Sure enough, every single one of them had Jeff in it. His grin burned into pixels.

I hovered over the delete button, but something stopped me. Instead, I typed a new prompt. “Beautiful sunset over the ocean.”

For a moment, it worked. The AI gave me a glowing orange sky, waves reflecting the light. Peaceful.

Then, just as I exhaled in relief, I saw him.
In the corner of the beach. Tiny, but visible. A pale figure standing where the surf met the sand. Staring.

And there, bottom right: Jeff.

I slammed my laptop shut. My reflection in the dark screen startled me—I looked pale, sweaty, like I’d seen a ghost.

That night I dreamed of him. I was standing in a white void, endless and empty, except for Jeff’s face floating closer and closer. His grin didn’t move, but his voice whispered: “Go to sleep.”

I woke up gasping.

I told myself I’d stop using the AI. It wasn’t worth it. I uninstalled the program. Deleted my cache.

But the images… they didn’t go away.

A few days later, I was scrolling through my phone gallery. Among my regular photos—selfies, random memes, screenshots—I saw one that didn’t belong.

It was Jeff. His face, cropped close, grinning wide.
I swore out loud and almost dropped my phone.

I hadn’t downloaded that. I hadn’t taken it.

And yet, there it was. Timestamps matched the night I uninstalled the AI.

I tried deleting it, but the photo wouldn’t go away. I pressed delete again and again. My phone just buzzed, like it was rejecting the command. Finally, the screen went black, and when it came back on… there were three copies of the photo.

All slightly different. His smile wider in each one.

I didn’t sleep that night.

It only got worse.

Every time I opened my phone, more pictures appeared. Not just Jeff’s face anymore. Pictures of my room. My desk. My bed.

Angles I didn’t recognize. Like someone had been standing in the corner, snapping photos while I wasn’t looking.

And in every one, Jeff was there. In the background. In the doorway. In the reflection of the mirror.

Always closer.

The last straw was last night. I was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, too wired to sleep. My phone buzzed on the nightstand. Notification: “New AI render complete.”

I hadn’t reinstalled the app.

Hands shaking, I picked up the phone. Opened the image.

It was me.
Me, lying in my bed. Exactly as I was right now. The angle was from the doorway.

And in the darkness behind me, leaning over, was Jeff. His grin splitting my screen in half.

At the bottom, the caption burned into the pixels:

Go to sleep.


I’m writing this as fast as I can. I don’t know how he’s doing it. The AI, my phone, my camera roll—they’re not supposed to work like this.

But Jeff’s face is everywhere now. On my laptop. My phone. Even when I blink, I see him behind my eyelids.

And I swear… I just heard my front door creak open.

I don’t know how I’m still functioning. I haven’t properly slept since that night—the night the AI sent me an image of myself in bed, with Jeff standing over me.

I’ve barely eaten. My body feels like it’s running on fumes and adrenaline. Every sound makes me jump. The floor creaks, my fridge hums, a car passes outside—and I flinch, convinced it’s him.

But the scariest part? I’m not even sure what’s real anymore.

After I finished writing the first part of this (hoping that maybe sharing it would make me feel less alone), I checked my phone again.

The gallery was worse. Way worse.

It wasn’t just pictures of my room anymore. Now there were videos. Silent clips, maybe five seconds each. The shaky motion of someone walking, a camera angled at hip height. My hallway. My bathroom. The stairs creaking under invisible weight.

In every single video, Jeff appeared. Sometimes at the end of the hall. Sometimes in the bathroom mirror. Sometimes just passing across the frame, like he knew I was watching and wanted to tease me.

But the most horrifying clip wasn’t of my house. It was of me.

The angle was from inside my own closet. The door cracked just enough to see me sitting on my bed, hunched over, typing on my laptop. The video ended with my head jerking up, like I’d heard something.

I don’t remember hearing anything when that was filmed. I don’t remember ever being watched.

The timestamp said the video was created five minutes earlier.

That same night, I heard something. I’d shoved a chair under the doorknob, barricaded myself in my room like a scared kid. Around 3:12 AM, I heard soft scratching.

Not at the door.
At the window.

Three stories up.

I froze. My blinds were down, but I could hear it—nails dragging lightly against the glass, like someone was trying to trace letters. Then a pause. Then two slow knocks.

I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe. My phone was in my hand, but I was too terrified to shine the flashlight. I thought maybe if I stayed still long enough, he’d go away.

The scratching stopped.

I finally worked up the courage to peek through a sliver in the blinds.

Nothing. Just the night.

But when I pulled back, my phone buzzed. A new image notification.

It was a photo of me, taken from outside the window. My pale, terrified face staring through the blinds. And in the corner of the picture, a reflection on the glass—Jeff’s smile glowing against the black sky.

The caption, as always:
Go to sleep.

The next morning, I couldn’t take it anymore. I stuffed clothes in a backpack and drove to my friend Aaron’s place across town. I didn’t tell him the full story—just said I was having “weird stalker problems.” He let me crash on his couch without asking too many questions.

For a moment, I thought maybe I was safe. His apartment felt different, cleaner, warmer. No shadows lurking in corners. I started to believe maybe Jeff couldn’t follow me outside my house.

But then Aaron made breakfast, and I opened my phone to check the time.

The gallery had new photos.

Photos of Aaron. Standing at the stove. Pouring coffee. Smiling cluelessly at me.

In every single one, Jeff was behind him.

Watching.

I almost screamed. Instead, I slammed the phone face-down on the table. Aaron looked at me funny, asked if I was okay. I lied. Said I was fine.

I wasn’t fine.

Later that afternoon, while Aaron went out for groceries, I tried deleting the pictures again. Same result: the phone buzzed, resisted, then multiplied the images instead of erasing them. By the time I stopped, there were dozens. Hundreds. Jeff in every one. His grin sharp enough to cut glass.

I realized then: he wasn’t tied to my house. He was tied to me.

That night at Aaron’s, I was half-asleep on the couch when my phone buzzed again. Another “AI render.” I hadn’t touched the app in days. I didn’t even think it was installed anymore.

This time, the image wasn’t a picture. It was text. Black background. White letters, crudely formed, like handwriting.

> “I can see you.”



I nearly dropped the phone.

Another notification. Another text-render.

> “Why are you hiding?”



My fingers trembled as I typed a response in the prompt box, just to see if it would work.
I wrote: “What do you want?”

The screen froze for a moment. Then the reply came back:

> “To tuck you in.”



I shut the phone off and threw it across the room.

But when I picked it up in the morning, the screen was still lit. The words hadn’t gone away.

Here’s the worst part.

The photos aren’t just of my house or Aaron’s anymore. They’re of places I haven’t even been yet.

This morning I scrolled through and found a picture of a laundromat. Empty, except for Jeff leaning against a dryer. Another of a bus stop across town. Another of my old high school classroom.

In each one, Jeff is closer. Sometimes smiling at me. Sometimes smiling at whoever else is there.

It’s like he’s mapping the places I might go, preparing them for me.

Like he’s waiting.

Aaron didn’t last long. By the third night, he kicked me out. Couldn’t deal with me jumping at every sound, locking every door twice, muttering to myself about Jeff. He said I needed therapy. Said I was freaking him out.

I didn’t argue. I just left.

Back at my place, I locked every window and door. I shoved furniture against the walls. I even unplugged my Wi-Fi, as if that could somehow cut off Jeff’s connection.

It didn’t.

At 4:03 AM, I woke up to the sound of my closet door creaking open.

I froze in bed. My barricaded bedroom door was still shut. Nothing else should’ve been able to move. But the closet—my closet—was yawning wider, inch by inch.

I couldn’t see inside. Only darkness.

My phone buzzed on the nightstand.

With trembling fingers, I grabbed it and unlocked the screen. A new image glowed back at me.

It was my room. A photo from inside the closet. Taken from the shadows.

I saw myself, wide-eyed, clutching my phone under the covers.

And behind me—just inches away in the photo—Jeff’s smile.

I can’t explain what’s happening. This isn’t a glitch, isn’t a virus, isn’t some ARG. Jeff is real. He’s bleeding through the screen, crawling out of the pixels and into my life. But I Don’t Think He’s Digital Anymore

I haven’t told anyone else. Who would believe me? “An AI is haunted by Jeff the Killer”? They’d laugh me off the internet.

But I’m not laughing.

Because just now, while writing this, I noticed something out of the corner of my eye.

The mirror across the room.

There’s movement in it. A pale shape, standing where I’m sitting, grinning as I type.

I don’t dare look up.

But the reflection is smiling wider.

After 15 years of our relationship and 12 years as married with a 6 year old daughter we still have a very passionate and regular sex life.

Last year was particularly difficult after my mothers death and also in her and my work place due to immense pressure we both were handling. She was in a new leadership role and felt isolated and didnt know whom to share her stress with as she didnt want to add up to my stress.

She made a friendship with a male colleague who was very easy going and she liked that ease as that allowed her to destress. She kept the friendship from me as she knew i wouldn’t approve a close friendship with a male colleague as i have always insisted. She has difficulty making friends due to her nature and finds friendship with men easier.

She made ground rules at the starting itself with him telling him that she was only looking for a friendship as she is very happy in her marital life. Also in the first week she asked him twice “we are just friends right” as she was confused why she felt so good talking to someone. Once she felt safe in the friendship she opened up a lot about our marriage, all the good things and passion we have.

So the friendship deepened and she took the friendship very seriously. Gave him gifts like books and pens. She spoke about our sex life in detail as she felt it was like a guys friendship and she felt like a guy with him. They went out during lunch and sometimes coffee.

But suddenly the colleague reduced talking and once she asked he said he had developed feelings for her. To this she said she didnot feel the safe and loved me too much.

She continued messaging him even though he didnt reply asking him to keep the friendship and get over his feelings and couldn’t stop msging as she was addicted to the relief she felt from talking to him. I caught her through a message i saw in her phone one day and slowly the hidden and secret friendship came to light.

She has completely cut contact and promises will never even talk to a man other than professionally. She is extremely loving to me but i keep wondering if this was just a friendship or an affair.",6,1759924745.0,cheating_stories,8,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1o18emf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlumbersOfNewYork/comments/1o18emf/how_to_handle_clogged_drains_in_new_york/,How to Handle Clogged Drains in New York Apartments,"Clogged drains are a frequent headache for New Yorkers, especially in older apartment buildings. Slow or blocked drains can cause water backup, unpleasant odors, and even damage to your pipes if left untreated.

**Signs of a Clogged Drain:**

* Water drains slowly from sinks, showers, or tubs
* Gurgling noises when water is running
* Foul smells coming from drains

**Solutions & Tips:**

1. **DIY Cleaning:** Try a plunger or a drain snake for minor clogs. Avoid chemical drain cleaners—they can damage old pipes.
2. **Regular Maintenance:** Clean hair traps, avoid pouring grease or coffee grounds down the drain, and flush drains with hot water regularly.
3. **Check Vent Pipes:** Blocked vent pipes can also slow drainage—professionals can inspect and clear them.
4. **Call a Licensed Plumber:** Persistent or severe clogs need professional attention to prevent pipe damage and ensure long-term solutions.

**Tip:** Regular maintenance and quick action on slow drains can save you from costly repairs later.

1o18d9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1o18d9z/the_ai_i_used_didnt_generate_art_it_summoned_jeff/,"The AI I Used Didn’t Generate Art, It Summoned Jeff the Killer","I should’ve known better than to play around with things I didn’t understand.
But when everyone online was messing with those new AI art generators, I figured I’d join in. At first, it was harmless—fun, even. I was never good at drawing, but here I was, typing a few words into a box and watching eerie, detailed images appear in seconds. Monsters, haunted houses, surreal dreamscapes… the AI gave me what I wanted, and more.

I’d stay up late at night, just experimenting. Prompts like: “a monster crawling from a mirror, photorealistic, horror” or “smiling ghost in a dark alley”. The results were fascinating. Sometimes unsettling, sometimes goofy. I laughed at most of them, even shared a few with my friends.

But then… something changed.

It started when I typed a simple prompt: “creepy face in the dark”. The AI spat out an image almost instantly—faster than usual. I thought maybe the servers were running better that night. But when I saw the picture, my stomach dropped.

The face was pale. Skin stretched, almost waxy. Eyes rimmed in black, like the eyelids had been burned away. And the smile… too wide, carved like a wound. I didn’t even have to think. My brain whispered the name before I realized it:

Jeff the Killer.

At first, I laughed nervously. Jeff the Killer was just one of those old internet urban legends—something that circulated when I was a kid. Grainy photos, badly written creepypastas. It wasn’t real.

Still… the AI had nailed it. I hadn’t typed anything close to “Jeff the Killer.” Just creepy face in the dark.

I shrugged it off and typed another prompt: “forest at night, shadowy figure.”
The image processed. And there he was again. Same pale skin, same grin. This time he was half-hidden behind the trees.

Okay, weird coincidence. Algorithms sometimes “latch” onto styles. Maybe someone had trained this model on old creepypasta memes, and Jeff’s face got baked in. I could explain it.

Except… the more I tried, the less sense it made.

No matter what I typed—“abandoned hospital,” “smiling clown,” “old man reading a book”—Jeff’s face showed up somewhere in the image. Sometimes faint, like he was lurking in the shadows. Sometimes front and center, staring directly at me.

By the fifth image, I noticed something else. A thin line of text burned into the bottom corner. Not the AI watermark. Just one word:

Jeff.

At first, I thought maybe I’d accidentally typed it as a prompt. I checked. My last input was “cozy fireplace scene, digital art.” Nothing about Jeff. Yet there he was, crouched in the corner of the fireplace, teeth shining.

I tried again. “Cute kitten, watercolor.”
The AI gave me the kitten. But behind it, blurry but unmistakable, was the smile. And at the bottom, that same word:

Jeff.

I remember pushing my chair back so hard it squealed against the floor. My heart was pounding. This wasn’t funny anymore.

I closed the program, shut off my laptop, and went to bed.

The next morning, I tried to forget about it. Maybe it was just a glitch. Maybe someone had slipped a “Jeff filter” into the model as a joke. AI tools are weird sometimes. I went about my day—classes, coffee, scrolling Reddit.

That night, though, curiosity got the better of me. I turned my laptop back on. Opened the AI app. My recent renders were still saved in my gallery. Sure enough, every single one of them had Jeff in it. His grin burned into pixels.

I hovered over the delete button, but something stopped me. Instead, I typed a new prompt. “Beautiful sunset over the ocean.”

For a moment, it worked. The AI gave me a glowing orange sky, waves reflecting the light. Peaceful.

Then, just as I exhaled in relief, I saw him.
In the corner of the beach. Tiny, but visible. A pale figure standing where the surf met the sand. Staring.

And there, bottom right: Jeff.

I slammed my laptop shut. My reflection in the dark screen startled me—I looked pale, sweaty, like I’d seen a ghost.

That night I dreamed of him. I was standing in a white void, endless and empty, except for Jeff’s face floating closer and closer. His grin didn’t move, but his voice whispered: “Go to sleep.”

I woke up gasping.

I told myself I’d stop using the AI. It wasn’t worth it. I uninstalled the program. Deleted my cache.

But the images… they didn’t go away.

A few days later, I was scrolling through my phone gallery. Among my regular photos—selfies, random memes, screenshots—I saw one that didn’t belong.

It was Jeff. His face, cropped close, grinning wide.
I swore out loud and almost dropped my phone.

I hadn’t downloaded that. I hadn’t taken it.

And yet, there it was. Timestamps matched the night I uninstalled the AI.

I tried deleting it, but the photo wouldn’t go away. I pressed delete again and again. My phone just buzzed, like it was rejecting the command. Finally, the screen went black, and when it came back on… there were three copies of the photo.

All slightly different. His smile wider in each one.

I didn’t sleep that night.

It only got worse.

Every time I opened my phone, more pictures appeared. Not just Jeff’s face anymore. Pictures of my room. My desk. My bed.

Angles I didn’t recognize. Like someone had been standing in the corner, snapping photos while I wasn’t looking.

And in every one, Jeff was there. In the background. In the doorway. In the reflection of the mirror.

Always closer.

The last straw was last night. I was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, too wired to sleep. My phone buzzed on the nightstand. Notification: “New AI render complete.”

I hadn’t reinstalled the app.

Hands shaking, I picked up the phone. Opened the image.

It was me.
Me, lying in my bed. Exactly as I was right now. The angle was from the doorway.

And in the darkness behind me, leaning over, was Jeff. His grin splitting my screen in half.

At the bottom, the caption burned into the pixels:

Go to sleep.


I’m writing this as fast as I can. I don’t know how he’s doing it. The AI, my phone, my camera roll—they’re not supposed to work like this.

But Jeff’s face is everywhere now. On my laptop. My phone. Even when I blink, I see him behind my eyelids.

And I swear… I just heard my front door creak open.

I don’t know how I’m still functioning. I haven’t properly slept since that night—the night the AI sent me an image of myself in bed, with Jeff standing over me.

I’ve barely eaten. My body feels like it’s running on fumes and adrenaline. Every sound makes me jump. The floor creaks, my fridge hums, a car passes outside—and I flinch, convinced it’s him.

But the scariest part? I’m not even sure what’s real anymore.

After I finished writing the first part of this (hoping that maybe sharing it would make me feel less alone), I checked my phone again.

The gallery was worse. Way worse.

It wasn’t just pictures of my room anymore. Now there were videos. Silent clips, maybe five seconds each. The shaky motion of someone walking, a camera angled at hip height. My hallway. My bathroom. The stairs creaking under invisible weight.

In every single video, Jeff appeared. Sometimes at the end of the hall. Sometimes in the bathroom mirror. Sometimes just passing across the frame, like he knew I was watching and wanted to tease me.

But the most horrifying clip wasn’t of my house. It was of me.

The angle was from inside my own closet. The door cracked just enough to see me sitting on my bed, hunched over, typing on my laptop. The video ended with my head jerking up, like I’d heard something.

I don’t remember hearing anything when that was filmed. I don’t remember ever being watched.

The timestamp said the video was created five minutes earlier.

That same night, I heard something. I’d shoved a chair under the doorknob, barricaded myself in my room like a scared kid. Around 3:12 AM, I heard soft scratching.

Not at the door.
At the window.

Three stories up.

I froze. My blinds were down, but I could hear it—nails dragging lightly against the glass, like someone was trying to trace letters. Then a pause. Then two slow knocks.

I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe. My phone was in my hand, but I was too terrified to shine the flashlight. I thought maybe if I stayed still long enough, he’d go away.

The scratching stopped.

I finally worked up the courage to peek through a sliver in the blinds.

Nothing. Just the night.

But when I pulled back, my phone buzzed. A new image notification.

It was a photo of me, taken from outside the window. My pale, terrified face staring through the blinds. And in the corner of the picture, a reflection on the glass—Jeff’s smile glowing against the black sky.

The caption, as always:
Go to sleep.

The next morning, I couldn’t take it anymore. I stuffed clothes in a backpack and drove to my friend Aaron’s place across town. I didn’t tell him the full story—just said I was having “weird stalker problems.” He let me crash on his couch without asking too many questions.

For a moment, I thought maybe I was safe. His apartment felt different, cleaner, warmer. No shadows lurking in corners. I started to believe maybe Jeff couldn’t follow me outside my house.

But then Aaron made breakfast, and I opened my phone to check the time.

The gallery had new photos.

Photos of Aaron. Standing at the stove. Pouring coffee. Smiling cluelessly at me.

In every single one, Jeff was behind him.

Watching.

I almost screamed. Instead, I slammed the phone face-down on the table. Aaron looked at me funny, asked if I was okay. I lied. Said I was fine.

I wasn’t fine.

Later that afternoon, while Aaron went out for groceries, I tried deleting the pictures again. Same result: the phone buzzed, resisted, then multiplied the images instead of erasing them. By the time I stopped, there were dozens. Hundreds. Jeff in every one. His grin sharp enough to cut glass.

I realized then: he wasn’t tied to my house. He was tied to me.

That night at Aaron’s, I was half-asleep on the couch when my phone buzzed again. Another “AI render.” I hadn’t touched the app in days. I didn’t even think it was installed anymore.

This time, the image wasn’t a picture. It was text. Black background. White letters, crudely formed, like handwriting.

> “I can see you.”



I nearly dropped the phone.

Another notification. Another text-render.

> “Why are you hiding?”



My fingers trembled as I typed a response in the prompt box, just to see if it would work.
I wrote: “What do you want?”

The screen froze for a moment. Then the reply came back:

> “To tuck you in.”



I shut the phone off and threw it across the room.

But when I picked it up in the morning, the screen was still lit. The words hadn’t gone away.

Here’s the worst part.

The photos aren’t just of my house or Aaron’s anymore. They’re of places I haven’t even been yet.

This morning I scrolled through and found a picture of a laundromat. Empty, except for Jeff leaning against a dryer. Another of a bus stop across town. Another of my old high school classroom.

In each one, Jeff is closer. Sometimes smiling at me. Sometimes smiling at whoever else is there.

It’s like he’s mapping the places I might go, preparing them for me.

Like he’s waiting.

Aaron didn’t last long. By the third night, he kicked me out. Couldn’t deal with me jumping at every sound, locking every door twice, muttering to myself about Jeff. He said I needed therapy. Said I was freaking him out.

I didn’t argue. I just left.

Back at my place, I locked every window and door. I shoved furniture against the walls. I even unplugged my Wi-Fi, as if that could somehow cut off Jeff’s connection.

It didn’t.

At 4:03 AM, I woke up to the sound of my closet door creaking open.

I froze in bed. My barricaded bedroom door was still shut. Nothing else should’ve been able to move. But the closet—my closet—was yawning wider, inch by inch.

I couldn’t see inside. Only darkness.

My phone buzzed on the nightstand.

With trembling fingers, I grabbed it and unlocked the screen. A new image glowed back at me.

It was my room. A photo from inside the closet. Taken from the shadows.

I saw myself, wide-eyed, clutching my phone under the covers.

And behind me—just inches away in the photo—Jeff’s smile.

I can’t explain what’s happening. This isn’t a glitch, isn’t a virus, isn’t some ARG. Jeff is real. He’s bleeding through the screen, crawling out of the pixels and into my life. But I Don’t Think He’s Digital Anymore

I haven’t told anyone else. Who would believe me? “An AI is haunted by Jeff the Killer”? They’d laugh me off the internet.

But I’m not laughing.

Because just now, while writing this, I noticed something out of the corner of my eye.

The mirror across the room.

There’s movement in it. A pale shape, standing where I’m sitting, grinning as I type.

I don’t dare look up.

But the reflection is smiling wider.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1o189rt,https://i.redd.it/w0nb9e9hkvtf1.png,The Great American Identity Crisis,"# The Great American Identity Crisis

*By Brent Antonson  — 3 min read*

“The beautiful and the innocent have no enemy but time.”

America was once both.

I say this as a Canadian—with no vote, but a dog in the fight. I love the United States. I’ve worked illegal jobs just to experience her. I’ve driven through every single state, bathed in the American Dream, and peered into its fractures. I was denied a green card. I wasn’t even eligible for the lottery. So I did what many dreamers do: I snuck in through the back door. In my case, that meant pumping gas in a frigid Wyoming town for $4 an hour.

And I was happy to do it.

There was character in that landscape. The men carried a cowboy slant. I relished the view from the outside looking in. And had I been caught? I would’ve taken the deportation with no complaint. That’s the risk. That’s the deal. Canadians understand the rules—we’re taught them young.

But let the record show: I wasn’t a threat to the system. I wanted in. I wanted to be part of the assembly line of the American experiment. My motives wouldn’t fit on an immigration form—I was simply bored of Vancouver, still “the little city that could, but wouldn’t.” My soul yearned for Vermont pastures, greasy Chinese takeout in Hell’s Kitchen, and sneaking into Dolly Parton’s theme park at 2 a.m. in Tennessee.

Call it romantic. Call it illegal. In the right light, it was all epic Americanism.

# A Borderline Devotion

Here’s something most people don’t know:  
Jack Kerouac, patron saint of American road-writing, only touched 17 states.  
John Steinbeck? Twenty-eight.  
Bill Bryson, my literary mentor, managed 38 in two trips.  
I drove through all 50. Sleeping in my car. Just to feel it. To know her. To honor the dream from the outside.

Thank you, America. You once shined.

There was an era—the Apple Pie years, call them—when patriotism wasn’t performative. When *Better Homes & Gardens* sat proudly on coffee tables, and the flag stood not for one party, but for all. John Hughes bottled the spirit in films like *Sixteen Candles* and *The Breakfast Club*—a Rockwellian innocence, now nearly unfilmable in today’s outrage economy.

America wasn’t just a country.  
It was *the* country.  
And then something veered.

# The Trump Detour

At its worst, Trump’s presidency is like a four-year construction project: detours, orange cones, and the occasional promise of a smoother ride. Whether you see him as a savior or saboteur, there’s no denying he touched the third rail of American identity. Over and over.

And people can’t look away.

If his goal is to rewind the clock to America’s peak, I don’t blame him. I might even endorse the attempt—were I American. But his methods feel like hammering random nails just to see which one bleeds. It’s less restoration, more recalibration-by-chaos.

I don’t know what a detour from this roadwork looks like. But I know the highway once mattered. And it’s cracked now—riddled with slogans, conspiracies, and partisan potholes. From any angle, the United States looks stalled in a ditch while the rest of the world drives cautiously by.

# Where Do We Go From Here?

Canada will take you in—if you qualify. And if we catch you here illegally? We’ll send you back too. No fuss, no drama. That’s how sovereign borders work.

I don’t say that coldly. I say it with respect. Rules matter. But so does reverence.

Because for all its flaws, America was worth knowing. Worth crossing lines for.  
And if it ever finds its way back to Main Street, U.S.A.—with its diners, its optimism, its humble pride—I’ll be the first one pumping gas in Wyoming again. Not for the paycheck.

For the myth.

>

America was once both. Now it’s stuck in traffic.

I say this as a Canadian — with no vote, but a dog in the fight. I love America. I’ve worked illegal jobs just to experience her. I’ve driven through every single state, bathed in the American Dream, and studied both its shine and its cracks.

I was denied a green card. Couldn’t even enter the lottery system, which is open to anyone in Mexico, but not to Canadians. So I found another way. I spent a year working my way around America. A few months of that in Wyoming, pumping gas in subzero winds for $4 an hour.

And I was thrilled to do it.

There was character in that landscape. The men looked like they’d been carved out of horse sweat and gravel. I watched them from the outside, grinning, knowing exactly what I was doing: playing the long game. If I’d been caught? Deport me. No protest. No headlines. That’s the risk. Canadians know that. It’s the game.

But in my defense — I’m a proud fourth-generation Norwegian. A sliver of the population. In the racial spectrum, I rank just under albinos. And yes, I was freezing, sore, and legally invisible. But I was doing a job Americans didn’t want.

No, send me back home.

If I’m caught working illegally tomorrow, send me back across the 49th parallel. But don’t mistake my presence for protest. I wasn’t trying to game the system — I wanted to be part of it. A cog in the American machine. My reasons wouldn’t fit on an immigration form: I was bored of Vancouver, still the little city that could—but didn’t. I’d traveled most of the world as a kid, but something in me longed for Vermont’s pastures, greasy Chinese takeout in Hell’s Kitchen, and sneaking into Dolly Parton’s theme park at 2 a.m. in Tennessee.

In the right light, everything I did could be read as pure Americanism.

Kerouac, the avatar of American freedom, only visited 17 states. Steinbeck, in Travels with Charley, covered 28. My mentor, Bill Bryson, managed 38. Me? I hit all 50. Slept in my car. Ate at gas stations. Crossed the entire country alone — fascinated, foreign, and utterly grateful.

Thank you, America. You once shined.

# Then Came the Roadwork

There was a time — the Apple Pie years — when America glowed with something close to innocence. The 1980s and 90s. When John Hughes films gave us small-town sanctity and flag-waving wasn’t a political act, just a gesture of shared belonging. Families read Better Homes & Gardens. People decorated with optimism. America wasn’t just a country — it was the country.

But that era faded. Now the place feels like it missed an exit, veered off the International Highway, and flipped into a ditch teeming with social justice alligators. Chaos. No map. And the rest of the world drives by, unwilling to stop.

Into that comes Trump — part detour, part demolition crew.

At his worst, Trump’s presidency feels like a construction zone that swallowed the entire country. Orange cones in every direction. Everyone honking. Promises of a smooth ride just ahead, if you can make it past the wreckage.

Is he trying to rewind the clock to that American peak? Maybe. And if I were American, I might even support the ambition — but not the execution. Trump hammers at everything, hoping some nail dares to stick out. It’s not restoration. It’s rage carpentry.

I don’t know what a detour from this detour looks like.  
Fleeing to Canada? You’re welcome here — if you qualify. And if not? We’ll deport you, too. Quietly. Cleanly. That’s sovereignty.

# Final Exit?

The truth is: America was once beautiful. And it was innocent. But time doesn’t care.

Now it echoes through TikToks, talk shows, and threads of outrage, trying to remember its lines. It wanders through a deep, digital forest — looking for Main Street, U.S.A., but always arriving at another parking lot argument.

If Trump’s still trying to find the way back, he might want to stop hammering.

1o180kp,https://i.redd.it/kes5puuvfvtf1.png,Cross-Subreddit Facts #1 - Good Witch Immunity,"**TL;DR:** Glinda the Good Witch's actress, Billie Burke, was the only major Oz cast member to be completely unharmed on set.

Various tragedies happened on the set of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's *The Wizard of Oz* in the late 1930s. Hollywood's knowledge of health and safety protocols is as developed as the Scarecrow's brain before he met the Wizard. 

Almost every major cast member had at least one thing that happened to them on set:

* Bert Lahr (Cowardly Lion) often sweat in his costume, which was made of real lion fur, under the bright studio lights, which were 38°C/100°F. The lights were extremely bright to give the film its iconic Technicolor look.
* Buddy Ebsen (Tin Man) had the aluminum dust on his makeup coat his lungs, which had him experience an allergic reaction. He was rushed to the hospital only 9 days into filming. The role of the Tin Man was later recast to Jack Haley.
* Jack Haley, on the other hand, had an aluminum paste as his makeup, like that made it any better. It was just as toxic as the dust, causing multiple eye infections.
* Ray Bolger (Scarecrow) had his costume stuffed with asbestos to protect him from the fire his character suffered in the movie. Not only that, when filming wrapped up, his mask left marks on his face.
* Margaret Hamilton (Wicked Witch of the West) suffered burning when filming her character's exit from Munchkinland. Her hat and broom caught fire, and she was covered in completely toxic green makeup.
* Judy Garland (Dorothy Gale) was put on a diet of black coffee, chicken soup, and over 80 cigarettes a day during filming.

Now, what about Glinda? 

Well, Billie Burke, the actress playing the role, was showbiz royalty, and was the most famous actor on set. Her dressing room was pink and blue, with perfume and peppermints. This was the opposite of Margaret Hamilton's dressing room, which had almost no decoration.

She also only had three appearances in the movie: Munchkinland, Poppies, and Emerald City, which meant less accidents.

So, she was given princess treatment, in comparison to the other cast members.",2,1759923465.0,wizardofoz,0,1.0,False
1o180ds,https://i.redd.it/vex3h4zyjvtf1.png,The Odyssey of My Lost Parcel,"Once upon a time, in the mystical lands of the Netherlands, I ordered a treasure—a glorious Steam Deck, the stuff of legends. Little did I know, the true adventure wouldn’t be gaming… it would be surviving **GLS.**

On **30 September**, my parcel was born. “The parcel data was entered into the GLS IT system,” it said, “but fear not, adventurer, it has not yet been handed over.” A humble beginning.

By **1 October**, the parcel finally left the sender’s hands, only to embark on a journey that would make Odysseus jealous. It passed through Den Bosch like a secret agent slipping past enemy lines. But suddenly… **“Redelivery requested/Consignee request”** appeared on the tracking. A twist! Was it lost? Was it hiding? Was it playing a prank? No one knew.

The next day, **2 October**, the parcel reached Zwolle. “Expected to be delivered during the day,” the oracle proclaimed. I waited. I watched. I paced. I even made popcorn for the excitement. Hours passed. But the delivery never came. My parcel had ghosted me.

And now… here we are: **8 October.** Still no Steam Deck. The tracking page mocks me silently, frozen in time like a cruel meme: the last scan from 2 October whispers, “Good luck, mortal. You may never see your parcel.”

I imagine my package wandering the Netherlands, sipping coffee in Utrecht, sightseeing in Amsterdam, perhaps even sending postcards from Rotterdam. Meanwhile, I refresh the tracking page like it holds the secrets of the universe.

And so, my journey continues—**the epic tale of me vs. GLS**, a story of hope, despair, and eternal waiting. Will my parcel ever arrive? Will I finally play games on my Steam Deck? Only the GLS gods know…",1,1759923448.0,GLSsucks,0,1.0,False
1o17zuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1o17zuu/beans_that_arent_cut_out_of_pourer/,"Beans that aren't ""cut out"" of pourer?","Hi there - I just bought a bag from a local roaster, which they advertise as their morning blend, with fruity notes, etc....   However, the roast is surprisingly dark - I can see some oil and the beans are darker.

I did a pourover this morning, and the beans just ""puffed up"" with the bloom. then, when I poured more into the bed, the beans kept rising and clinging the the sides, rather than staying put in a nice bed at the bottom like I'm used to.

I guess this is a thing- sometime too dark of a roast (too light/hollow of a bean) just doesn't do well physically with pour over.  The coffee tastes \*fine\* but the advertised notes aren't really there, all all.  Interestingly, this roaster has been around since 1993 and are an institution in my area.  I guess this is just an older style of roasting (i.e. back when all ""good coffee"" was dark).

Anyone else have similar experiences?

That never really fit me. I catch myself muttering under my breath, grip my coffee mug too tight, and argue with gravity like it owes me an apology.

Aging doesn’t feel noble. It feels irritably human. Bodies creak. Wants change. Patience frays. Pride bruises when you used to be proud. I’ve read essays about “embracing wrinkles” or “finding peace in decline.” They’re lovely, but my aging feels stubborn, petty, full of small rebellions. Sometimes I refuse pain meds just to prove I can.

I came across one that nailed this mood — the restless, small-battle version of aging. It doesn’t romanticize what happens. It tolerates it. And that felt like permission.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1o17vmz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o17vmz,Alpha Journey (experiments and findings) [LID],"I finally finished my [car pattern](https://www.braceletbook.com/patterns/alpha/196468/) keychain! FINALLY. After several iterations, attempts, and experiments. And since I did so many experiments and such, trying to figure out what works best for me, I thought it would be nice to share my process and what worked, didn't work, etc for me. 

I am sure all of these things have been done by others in the past. Haha. But I am someone who needs to see what works best for me. And I hope to share my findings in the hopes that it might help someone else try something new, or to help them figure out what works best for them!

Alright, so I started bracelets two months ago. And it's been a wild ride. 

\-----

**First image**, my experiments, in (almost) order of attempts. Including pattern numbers from Bracelet Book. 

**Second Image:** labeling each attempt with the type of base strings I used. 

**Third Image:** Close up look on Car alpha projects. 

**Fourth image:** Close up on Pikmin projects

**Fifth Image:** Thread/string size/texture comparison. 

**Sixth Image:** Close up of completed car pattern.

\-----

# FIRST ATTEMPT

*(Image three)* My **first alpha attempt** was my car pattern which I made myself, and it did.not.go.well. Ha. I was like, oh I will use the Perle because it seemed like the right thing to do at the time. Like a clear difference, or something, I don't quite know, but it seemed right. 

I was so frustrated with it because it elongated. I did not understand why it did that. And, it was so hard. I also tried to do like, something crazy that I shouldn't have. I realize that of course, my first attempt was something way out of my skill level (something I regularly do to keep my ego in check... lol. jk, I do it even tho I humble and frustrate myself every time.... lol.). I did some research and found that the elongation could be because the base strings are too thin compared to the leading strings. 

***TL;DR:*** >!*After several attempts and experiments, I found that Crochet thread size 3 works amazing for me as base string. And chilling tf out is very important, I needed to stop trying to strangle the fluff right out of the thread!*!<

# CHANGE #1

For my **second attempt** I decided to double that for base strings. It still didn't work out well for me. I could tell that it was going to elongate, and I decided I didn't like my color choices. They were too close in shade. So, I stopped again. I felt that maybe this pattern was too complicated and decided I would narrow down a color or two, and pick a little bit different colors.

# CHANGE #2

In between that and my next attempt explained below I did some other alphas that aren't pictured. On those, **I doubled the base strings, using regular embroidery floss**. While I was happy with my outcomes, I was worried about how much floss I was using/wasting and wanted to find something that would be the appropriate thickness (for me), and cheaper. Cause, ugh. Right?

Went to Michael's and found crochet thread. They had two sizes, 10 and 3. I went with 3 at first, it seemed the closest to a double amount of floss. I decided that should work out, and bought that. It was so much cheaper than the embroidery floss too! 

# CHANGE #3-4

My **next attempt** was using crochet thread size 3 as my base string. But I used a different pattern *(image four, pikmin)*. I was like, I **need** to figure this out with something simpler and less color changes. Let's go with a pikmin, cause pikmin, obviously.  I used a single size 3 as my base string and found that it was still elongating. Frustrated, and feeling like I am wasting my time and materials, I decided to try and add a double base string to it to see how that went. So in image 4, drew a line on the first pikmin attempt where I added two strings as base string. Why start all over when I can just add more? lol. Anyway, I didn't like how that was going either! 

***Frustrated, I took a break, and did some normal patterns for a while. lol.*** 

Trying again, *(image 3)* i went back to the car pattern. I felt like I could do it. I just used single size 3 crochet thread as my base strings. It wasn't going well, AGAIN. I wanted to throw things. lol

*Frustrated on alphas, I decided I needed to watch some videos on what the heck I am doing wrong. I needed a video where hands were in the video enough that I could tell how tight I was doing my knots. I watched some videos by* [*Knot like the Others*](https://www.youtube.com/@knotliketheothers/videos)*. I noticed how NOT tight she was tying.* ***Like not tight at all.*** *I realized I needed more practice and to* ***chill tf out and stop trying to strangle the fluff out of the thread****. I also saw a video of hers that she was using size 10 crochet thread.*

# CHANGE #5-6

After watching some videos, I felt confident enough to try again, using what I call the **""Chill tf Out Method""**. lol. I tried using regular floss as my base string, I did not double it or anything. I decided on a simpler pattern, and chose the bee one. It was so cute. (image 2). This worked decently well! **I chilled out a bit.** But I still didn't like how ""thin"" the base strings were for me. It made it seem a little frustrating, and like I really had to pay attention, too much attention. 

I needed more practice before I went back to my car. I really wanted it to turn out well! 

# CHANGE #7-8

Here *(image 4, Pikmin)* I went back to using size 3 crochet thread with my major change being not tying tightly at all. Like just tying until it's tied and not pulling any more right than that. No more strangling, no more pain of the string on my fingers, not trying to kill the fluff of the string, I found, **the fluff is important! This went SO well!! By golly, I think I got it!**

**It was so much easier being chill. There wasn't as much pain in my fingers. The string didn't try to cut into my hands, and it actually was a much quicker and enjoyable process! Oh. em. gee.**

# CHANGE #9

But, I had something nagging at me. Now that I've calmed tf down... I felt like I needed to try some of the other things that I tried already... just to make sure... 

Back to the DMC Perle thread, I did double it because it seemed so thin (Bulborb, by yellow Pikmin). While it went ooookay, I didn't love it. Again with the focus and making sure everything was right. It was too much. 

# CHANGE #10

I decided I needed to try the **size 10 Crochet Thread**, *Knot like the Others* made it seem very good, like it was the thing to work with! haha So I went to Michael's and got it. Here we go. 

I tried that out on the first coffee alpha. It was elongating. Ugh, I could tell. So I stopped. I was super unhappy with it. Like, what am I doing wrong?! 

# CHANGE #11-12

Okay, lets **double the size 10 crochet thread** AND (rolls eyes) try the ***clean back alpha method***. Ma'am, too many variable changes, but I was on a roll. The coffee pattern was the perfect test subject for a clean back test. 

No. 

  
Like it worked, turned out nice. But elongated, and I don't love not seeing the floofiness. Like you lose a string of color when you're sandwiching and I don't love that. It worked well, but like, no. 

# CHANGE #13

I **doubled the size 10 crochet thread** and just did the ""regular"" **Chill tf out method**. By George, it worked out. But doubling thread is such a pain, honestly. ""but,"" I say to myself, ""at least I can use it up in that way... So it doesn't HAVE to go to waste. I probably wont  use the size 10 crochet thread otherwise. 

# FINAL BOSS. lol. 

I was now confident enough to go back to my car pattern. I still **narrowed down the colors**, and I used the **size 3 crochet thread**, along with the **Chill tf Out Method**. (FINAL IMAGE) I freaking DID it! And it looks AWESOME. Each ""pixel"" of the image is actually square, and it looks so freaking good! 

With the larger base string, I found that I didn't have to think so hard about how tight, or not, I was making the knots (after implementing and solidifying the Chill tf Out method). It really turned out to be the most enjoyable experience for me.

I did have to do shaped start on the little key chain thing, and I did still have a little issue with it not being super rectangular. Like it got a little fatter where the car image was, and thinner when I was just doing the background color (if you have suggestions on how to not let that happen, would love to hear it - though it could be because I was using Loops and Threads as the white background and the car was DMC). 



***TL;DR:*** >!*After several attempts and experiments, I found that Crochet thread size 3 works amazing for me as base string. And chilling tf out is very important, I needed to stop trying to strangle the fluff right out of the thread!*!<

I was fortunate to be in Taipei during the Taiwan Original Boardgame Expo 2025 (TOBE2025) at the end of September, so wanted to report out on all the games I saw & played. I want to highlight the local designers and publishers from Taiwan and East/Southeast Asia, and get them some recognition outside of Asian market.

The event is organized by Smoox Chen and is generally Taiwan's boardgaming ambassador (no shade to other Taiwanese publishers). On Saturday night closing hours, Smoox was running around yelling ""Please go home. If you don't go home, I can't go home!"" I believe this is the third year TOBE, and the event has been growing larger and taking up more space at the hosting venue.

The venue: Songshan Creative & Cultural Park is a former Taipei tobacco factory, repurposed for arts and events. Aside from the Taiwan Original Boardgame Expo that weekend, there was also a Jennie (KPop) x Stanley Mug collab exhibit, a Junji Ito merch exhibit ([Link to Walkthrough of the Exhibit - SPOOKY BEWARE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwihjtF_ues)), a Hololive exhibit, an art gallery, and a Japanese coffee & flowers show.

TOBE has been growing, taking up two of the Warehouse/Halls this year. Here are walkthroughs of the two event halls, Warehouse 4 and Warehouse 5.

##Games I Played##

**Kuroshio** - This fishing-themed pick-up-and-deliver game from Icerain Lin (TW) packs a good amount of planning into a very small box. Kuroshio is a warm ocean current near Taiwan and Japan, and you are fishermen boats traveling the map's fishing routes. On your turn, you play a card from your hand (of 3 cards) to the map, and move your boat along the paths until you reach your first empty fishing space (one of 3 colours). For example, if you end up at a blue fishing space, you count the number of blue fish schools that you've passed, and collect a Blue Fish token with that number. To turn these tokens into for points, you have to traverse to a Market space on the map, and either cash in all your fish tokens of a single colour, or all your tokens of a single number.

**Overparked** From prolific designer Daryl Chow (SG) published by Origame, Overparked is a tetromino game (very similar to My City) with a terrific theme. You are a parking lot valet, trying to squeeze all the cars into your parking lot. On a given turn, each player needs to add a given configuration of cars into your lot. Very fun feature are the car keys tokens, which can be used to shuffle a previously parked car (like those traffic jam car puzzles), and even drive a parked car to a temporary holding lot.

The scoring has similarities to My City, scoring for your largest contiguous group of each vehicle color. Overparked is not revolutionizing the genre, but it plays so smooth and mechanics are perfectly themed. The flexibility with the car keys makes it super forgiving and satisfying to come up with clever car-shuffling maneuvers.


**108 Outlaws** Also from Daryl Chow (SG), with art by Geoffrey Chia (SG) 108 Heroes is a tableau and recipe fulfillment game, based on one of the four classic Chinese novels, The Water Margin. There have been countless adaptations of two of the other classics, Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Journey to the West, so I was quite excited that the team chose to adapt The Water Margin.

Gameplay is pretty straightforward, each turn either draw cards or play a card. There are two types of playable cards - Earthly Fiends with one-time bonus when played, and Heavenly Stars with end-scoring bonus. Each card has a combination of icons on them - these icons are requirements to play the Heavenly outlaws as well as to claim Campaign mission cards (big points). Cards have to be exhausted when you use their icons, so there's timing and combos you need to optimize.

I love the choice of underrepresented source material, the art is phenomenal (the artist plunged into the novel for physical descriptions of all 108 outlaws), and the production has shiny foil. Excited to explore this game more.

**Torii** 2p abstract from Kuan Chen (TW) published by EmperorS4, at first glance I thought this was a title designed/published by a western designer/publisher, from the fantastic production quality.

Each player controls their spirit token on a 4x4 board. Each player has a 1-move, 2-move, 3-move action token; these tokens don't refresh until they've all been used. When your spirit moves, they will hop over any row or column occupied by your opponent (and vice versa), which makes for some interesting blocking/denial tactics. As your spirit moves, they drop followers on all the squared that they move through. If the opponent moves onto your follower's squares, your follower is replaced by the opponent's follower. If you manage to place 4 followers in a row or column, you can place a torii (gate) above one of those followers, and they become permanently on that space, immoveable by the opponent. Place all four torii to win.

The rules are straightfoward, and 6 different spirits with special powers show provide lots of room for exploration. A lot of emergent strategy as you play your first game. Definitely a game for ppl that enjoy the gameplay of Santorini (w God powers).

**Jump** is a 2P abstract from self-published Kevin Zhang (TW), a very charming cute-scary game about teams of Chinese jiangshi (zombies-vampires) that hop around and jump onto each others' backs. Your jiangshis have different power levels (weakest 1, strongest 3), and they can climb into each other's backs to combine their power level!

Once stacked, they can jump over enemies (yes, multiple) or friendlies or both, as long as the Jumper's power level is same or greater than those being jumped over. You can even jump OFF the board, claiming points for enemies jumped, and have jumper sit in limbo until they are brought back onto the board on a future turn. First to 8 points wins (claim points per strength of enemies jumped and eliminated).

Very interesting tactics in this one, fun table presence with a fabric play mat. Kevin Zhang publishes under his own Magica Studio, and his games at the show draw large crowds to try his other very eye-catchingly cute illustrated games (Dog Bone Dog, Dicecat & Fish).

**A.S.E.A.N. VERSE** has players trying to calm ghosts from Southeast Asian folklore and place them into their natural habitats. First impressions -- super cool that Southeast Asian culture and folklore are getting representation! From my Canadian bubble, I've only been exposed to Thai, Indonesian, and Filipino horror films that have cult followings, as well as the comic/animation Trese on Netflix. There's an entire pantheon of spooks that this game will inspire me to learn about.

The gameplay mostly consists of playing a card to your 4x3 tableau, and drawing a replacement card. Cards can be Ghosts or Terrain. Ghosts only score if they are connected to their Terrain requirements (e.g. 1 graveyard + 1 grassland). Terrain will score based on other Terrain cards in your tableau (Graveyards score 1 pt per Grassland icon in your tableau). If your terrain matches the Terrain requirements of a Ghost card in the public market, you can play it direct from the market as a bonus action. Rules are simple, but love the theming. For an expert game, each player is assigned a Shaman with special player powers. There's also a ""spooky"" variant where certain Ghost cards require players to do spooky things, like smile creepily or stand on one leg like they're possessed.

This game won the Thai Board Game Journey 2025 contest, incorporating information and artwork from Silpakorn Univerity's ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Ghosts Mythophobia project. Hope the game gets wider promotion based on the theme -- perfect for Spooky Season!

**Extreme Mission** from Hisashi Hayashi (JP) has players building up hands of cards (think Gin Rummy or Mahjong) to meet the public objectives (missions) of differing difficulties. A simple level 1 mission would be ""6 cards each between 2~8"". A difficult level 4 mission would be ""1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 of the same colour"". Luckily, you have five adorably illustrated secret agents to help you. They can be used as a wild card to represent any number & colour. You can even use multiple agents to help you with a mission! You can have ""1, 2, 6, 8"" of a colour, and spend all five of your agents at once. Once used, you need to spend an action and some card combination to Refresh your agents -- good way to spend driftwood/random cards from your hand. Winner is the first player to achieve four missions (one from each difficulty level) AND have all their agents refreshed.

Gameplay is quick, you're always engaged off-turns since you can draw cards from the draw deck or any player's personal discard, so you're constantly reassessing your hand against other players' discards and the mission board. The agent cards are stupidly charming.

**The Great Evening Banquet** from Saashi & Saashi with their distinctive illustrations, players are tasked with arranging various guests into their banquet hall, making sure to seat guests according to each table's rules (e.g. at least 2 guests with wine glasses, no guest in green colour, at least two matrons, no young women). Once each table is fully seated, you score that table (for maximum points: 1 of each guest - young man & woman, old man & woman, all in a single colour). Additional end-game bonus scoring are available based on conditions for each row and column of tables -- e.g. 1 VP per pair of old men in a column, 3VP if all guests at all tables in a row of limited to three colours only).

I've heard the comparison to Harmonies, as each round round, the guests are drawn from a bag and places into X piles, players taking the piles in turn order. There are similarities in trying to set up an ideal board, waiting for the correct guests tiles to show up to grab them. Banquet is more streamlined, as Harmonies requires you to deal with both pattern-matching the animal cube placement, as well as terrain placement for scoring. Banquet's theme is quite fun, and the game moves briskly (24 guests total, usually 2-3 guests drawn per round, occasionally 4). The alternate table arrangement variant looks very interesting and feels like a total headscratcher.

**Dinner's On You (Thank You for your Hospitality)** is a 2025 retheme of an existing game Tanome Nine, featuring art from artist Poki Chen (TW). Love love love the theme, which livens up the atmosphere. We're all ordering Taiwanese street food, but you better order something new/different when it's your turn, otherwise you're stuck playing the bill! 9 different items are available, each with a different cost. When it's your turn, play a food card from your hand that has not already been played. If unable, you have to take all the cards into your scoring pile. Two twists.One, if you manage to play a card and the table adds up to a round 100 (100, 200, 300, 400), the player before you has to pay instead (remember to say ""Thank you for your hospitality!""). Two, if you manage to play a 9th card onto the table and have a full spread, everyone else shares the bill and you pay nothing. End game scoring - count the NUMBER of cards in your scoring pile - lowest wins.

The game concept is simple, requires a bit of math, but the theme sold me. Looking forward to playing this as a starter or filler game with my gaming group.

**10 to Leave's**'s Chinese name is Mosquitos Escape - a bit more descriptive than the current English name. The theming connected me to childhood memories of mosquito bites and sleeping under mosquito-proof netting in southern Taiwan. And the in-game prop of using flipflops to swat them? Perfect. Players are given identical set of cards (1 through 6, some duplicated). On their turn, players either play a card from their hand into one of three rows surrounding the Sleeping Kid, or peek at a played card, or swap the position of two cards. When the Sleeping Kids wakes up, you evaluate the totals of each row of cards -- if it's a exact ten all the mosquitos escape to a victory pile! If less than ten or greater than ten, Sleeping Kid will eliminate some of those mosquitos -- sometimes the largest mosquito, sometimes the closest mosquito, depending on the cards' total. Light filler game with room for tactical double-think, it reminds me the slighest bit of Take 5.

Last pic is my haul pic -- games that I don't expect to be easily obtainable in North America. 

There's lots of more photos over on the BGG Post. Hope folks found these lesser-covered titles interesting to read about! Many of these will be available at Essen 2025, so look out for them.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

He imagined the hard crack of the scull smashing against the corner of the cabinet, the sudden sharp flow of blood from the head, the surprisingly pliant and accommodating body and it droops to the floor. No, he grabs the woman before she falls and clutches her tightly, softly, even lovingly. He slows her descent, uses a tea towel to cover the back of her head, and gently places her on the floor in the middle of the small fully fitted kitchen with working gas hob and do the fire alarms work properly? 

“What?”

“Sorry,” the woman said. “I need to test the fire alarms.” 

He wanted to cradle the woman as she nestles on the floor, and kisses her, gently, softly, warmly, piercingly and shrilly as a sudden alarm, the aforementioned fire alarm, blares. 

“I hate doing that,” the woman says. “Do you mind if I check the bedroom?” 

 The woman walks into the bedroom, but in his mind he has cradled her on the floor, blood held in place by the tea towel, and he ravishes her with soft kisses, her face, her neck, her breasts, no, not the breasts. He can’t bring himself to do that. He bravely turns away from the breasts, and stands back to see the body.

Now the fun part.

How to dispose of the body. 

His mind works quickly, walking back over plans he formulated months ago and has since walked through time and time again. Wrap the body in the black bin bags. Four should suffice. Use the duct tape to secure the bin bags. Fold the body into a suitcase. The green one he bought before the trip to Vienna. He should make sure the green suitcase doesn’t have any clothes or books in. Oh shit, maybe that’s where his copy of Under Western Eyes is. He hasn’t actually seen it since Vienna. Or the hotel? Did they leave it in the hotel? 

The hotel fire alarm blares, once, twice, three times. Then stops. No, not the hotel fire alarm. The one in his bedroom. The housing agent must need to check them all.

No, back to the disposal. Body in the now empty suitcase, suitcase down the rubbish chute, walk outside by the cameras and down to the bins, load the suitcase into the car, drive car, stop at Greenham Common, dump suitcase with the others, are there others? Yes, he decides. Yes, there are others. Four, he decides. No, five. 

But what if someone sees him loading the suitcase into the rubbish chute? Could he bring himself to kill two people within ten minutes? Could he be Raskolnikov? 

“All clear,” the woman says as she walks back from the bedroom. 

The thread of his plan was broken. The woman began talking about the next steps after the inspection, the landlord sending over the next contract, the fire alarms being fixed, the security cameras and whatnot. Kit was only half listening, numbly taking the documents she proffered, trying to bring back to mind the daydream, the smell of the blood, the feel of the rope. Was there a rope? No, the feel of the body smashing against the cabinet, the inky plastic of the black bin bag. 

He opened the door for her, and turned back to the kitchen table, his head scrambling for the lost threads. He poured over the books spread out on the table, the laptop, the sheets of paper with all his hand written notes. Nietzsche, morals, animals, cages. 

What does blood even taste like? He pulled out his phone and began searching through the internet. Copper, apparently. But what does copper taste like? Are there any pennies in the flat? 

He remembered there were pennies in the kitchen draw when his phone lit up and started vibrating. Kat was calling. 

“Hiya,” she said softly through the speakers. Kit held the phone screen up, close to his mouth.

“Mm,” he replied. The sound was neither yes nor no—just a vowel with weight in it.

“Where are you? I just had my meeting with Halbeard,” she added.

There was a pause. Kit sat down slowly at the kitchen table, the tarnished daydream still resting between his fingers, the feel of the soil drifting away.

“He seemed weird. I don’t know,” Kat continued. “Tired. Like he was already half somewhere else. But still trying to sound excited.”

“Excited about what?” Kit asked.

“Research,” she said. “A new project. I’ll explain when I see you. He didn’t say much about it.” Another pause. “He hugged me.”

Kit raised an eyebrow at the wall. “That’s new.”

“Yeah.”

“Did he say anything else?”

There was a hesitation or a moment or a blip. “Not really,” she said, and he could tell she was smiling, maybe not a real smile, her smile that tries to show everything is ok. He remembered she once talked about how people can hear smiles, and when you talk on the phone you should smile even if they can’t see you. She said she smiles every time on the phone just in case. “He just said to take care of myself. Told me to trust my instincts. The usual professor stuff.”

Kit smiled himself, not to reassure Kat, not so she could hear it, but because of the man, of Halbeard. “That’s rich coming from a man who told you the best thing you could do for your academic career was to become more ambiguous.”

“He said that again,” she replied, almost laughing. “And then he asked if I still took notes in pencil for some reason.”

Kit’s smile tightened, sudden interest peaking. “And do you?”

“Sometimes,” she said dismissively. “Not for him.”

They let the silence settle. Through the window, Kit could hear the distant sound of a train pulling out of the station, a low mechanical wail that reminded him of Halberd’s voice when he gave lectures, like something peeling away from itself.

Kat cleared her throat. “Hey, don’t forget. We’re going to that party tonight. Freya’s thing, remember?”

He didn’t. “Oh. Yeah. I remember.”

“I’ll head over in a bit,” she said. “Thought I might have a shower first. You at home?”

“Yeah,” Kit replied, glancing at the strewn books, the cold mug of coffee, the cigarette he forgot about an hour before. He was grasping a penny. He didn’t remember picking it up. It was wet against his palm. “I’m home.”

“Good,” she said, voice light, but edged with something else. Then quieter: “See you soon.”

She hung up.

Kit placed the penny on the table and stared at it.

He thought about blood again, about how it left the body, about how it clung to things, about how it would pool in the black bin bag and turn to jelly. And then he thought about the party, and whether she’d be wearing that perfume again, the one that always reminded him of library dust and old film reels.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1o17ns1,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1o17ns1/should_i_buy_my_stepchildren_xmas_presents/,Should I buy my stepchildren Xmas presents?,"So here’s the full context. This is deeply personal, and maybe some other stepchildren can weigh in with advice.. as I am lost.

I want my stepchildren to know that I care about them, but they’ve never spoken to or met me, which is understandable. My stepkids are adults in University, 2 stepdaughters and 1 stepson, and they still live with their mother. (Huge and obvious reason why I think they don’t want to connect!)

Divorce was when they were still toddlers and was a slow breakdown.. nothing terrible happened.. but seems like many small fights. I hear my husband did everything to make them feel welcome at his home in the early days, but they just had an easier time with school, location, and schedule to stick with their mum.

They’d still text or even go out to dinner sometimes with my husband lately as adults (or did), until I’m guessing the mother found out I exist? As the children seemed initially okay with my existence, until I think the mom stepped in with some harsh words because I’m younger and have a 5-year-old son (this is only an assumption due to the timing of matters) and I also assume it would bring up a lot of emotion. 

Then the 2 daughters said to their father that they wanted to go no-contact. The son was still contacting just the same, but whenever my husband mentioned coming over sometime for coffee with us, the more he backed away. I’m guessing to not rock the boat with the sisters and mum.

I was a widow, and so, I’m coming from a totally different lense here. We met in my country, because of shared niche tech interests. Then I migrated to my husband’s country partially because I wanted him to be able to still get the coffees with his kids. I joke it was 3 against 1, so I moved here, but I truly do care about them and want to help them, should they ever need.

He brings them easter baskets each year.. so this year I added some little things to the basket, but no note. No word from them. I’m thinking we could give a simple gift this year for Xmas too… but it made my husband upset to think of it, because he said they won’t respond. That it could be pushing them further away.

He only sends the little “Hey how are you? If you ever want to talk, you know I’m still here for you” texts.

I assume once they are out of their mother’s house and have more life experiences, maybe things could change. I also respect the mother. I don’t want to bother her. I want to show that I care, but I don’t want to scare them. I understand I’m this total stranger, and that my son is coincidentally being parented at the age where they had left off. So it’s probably a very difficult thing to confront.

Would you have any advice for me? Should we give a small gift and short letter to them.. or leave it be? Should I wait a few years until they are moved into their own apartments, to say hello?

I worry if anything should happen to their father, I wouldn’t even know how to contact them or what to say. I want to connect in some small way when things are good.. like chat about their hobbies, and I want them to know that they are loved and welcome. We are surely not as wealthy as their mum, so I can only give little things. Should we send any Xmas present or not? Let me know what you think. ❤️",1,1759922353.0,self,8,0.6,False

Been using the Gen2 for a week now and honestly, I’m kinda obsessed you could say. It’s super comfortable, I literally stopped wearing my watch because this does the same thing, and I don’t even feel it while sleeping. With a watch, I’d always wake up and take it off halfway through the night, but this just stays on like nothing’s there.

The alignment wheel is honestly such a cool touch. I open the app in the morning and instantly know how my day’s gonna flow, when I should be active and when to maybe hold off on that second coffee. Speaking of which, it is actually helping me not screw up my sleep schedule for once.

If I had to complain, the app does get a bit slow sometimes, like, you tap something and it just… thinks for a sec. And yeah, would be nice to have widgets or quick-glance stuff so I don’t always have to open the app. Hopefully they add that soon.

Battery life though? Wild. It’s been 7 days and I’m still sitting at 15%, though to be fair, I didn’t work out much this week. But overall, it’s been such a good experience.

1o17jlu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHome/comments/1o17jlu/how_to_fix_a_damaged_calendar_2026_cover/,How to fix a damaged calendar 2026 cover?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my experience with fixing a damaged calendar cover since I know many of us are starting to think about our planners for 2026. A few weeks ago, I accidentally spilled coffee all over my beautiful new calendar 2026, and I was devastated. But I figured out some pretty neat tricks to restore it!

First things first, don't panic if this happens to you. Whether you're dealing with water damage, tears, or coffee stains like me, there are several ways to salvage your calendar. I'll walk you through what worked for me and some other solutions I discovered during my research.

For liquid damage, immediately pat (don't rub!) the cover with paper towels. If you've got a laminated calendar 2026, you're in luck – these are much easier to clean. For paper covers, you'll need to be extra careful. I found that using a hair dryer on low heat while gently pressing the cover between clean, dry paper towels helps remove moisture without warping the paper.

For tears and rips, clear packing tape isn't your best friend here (trust me, I learned the hard way). Instead, grab some book binding tape – it's specifically designed for paper repairs and won't yellow over time. You can find some great options here: https://athometouch.com/calendar-2026

Now, if your cover is beyond repair, don't throw away the whole calendar! Here's a cool hack: You can create a new cover using cardstock or even repurpose a old folder. Just measure carefully, fold along the edges, and secure it with book binding tape. I actually ended up liking my DIY cover better than the original!

For those dealing with bent corners or creases, here's a pro tip: Use a bone folder tool to carefully smooth out the creases. If you don't have one, a credit card works too – just be gentle! You can find proper bookbinding tools and other calendar accessories here: https://athometouch.com/calendar-2026

I've also discovered that preventing damage is crucial. Consider getting a clear plastic cover protector – it's saved my new calendar from countless coffee near-misses! Plus, it gives that professional, sleek look while protecting your investment.

Remember, if your calendar has monthly tabs, be extra careful when working near them. They're usually the first things to tear or get damaged. If they're already damaged, you can reinforce them with small strips of clear tape or replace them with stick-on tabs.

Lastly, here's something I wish I knew earlier: store your calendar flat when not in use. Standing it upright or letting it hang can cause the cover to warp over time, especially in humid environments.

Hope these tips help someone out there! Let me know if you have any questions or other repair tricks to share. I'm always looking to learn new techniques!",1,1759921983.0,AskHome,0,1.0,False
1o17jjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarketingSecrets101/comments/1o17jjn/the_remote_work_dream_for_entrepreneurs_is_your/,The Remote Work Dream for Entrepreneurs: Is Your Home Office a Silent Burnout Trap?,"When remote work exploded during the pandemic, many entrepreneurs saw it as a dream come true: flexibility, no office rent, total freedom. But lately, as I quietly observe the patterns behind the headlines, especially among our Indian startup community, I've noticed a hidden truth. What was once seen as a boon is, for many, silently leading to widespread burnout. Did you know that 85% of entrepreneurs already struggle with mental health issues (Inc.com, 2022-2023)? Remote work often magnifies these challenges.

One of the biggest culprits is the blurring of boundaries between professional and personal life. Your home becomes your office, your bedroom, sometimes even your boardroom. A 2023 Microsoft Work Trend Index report highlighted that remote workers, including founders, struggle to maintain work-life boundaries and feel increased pressure to respond outside working hours. Annie Auerbach, author of 'Flex', vividly explains, ""Remote work blurs the lines... this erasure of boundaries is a fast track to exhaustion."" This often means working more. A 2020 NordVPN Teams study found remote workers globally averaged 3.1 hours more per day during the pandemic. Here in India, our joint family structures can exacerbate this; 'work from home' is sometimes misinterpreted as 'always available at home,' further eroding those crucial boundaries, as noted by Deloitte India's 2022-2023 mental health surveys.

Then there's the magnified isolation. Entrepreneurship can be a lonely journey even in an office, but remotely, it's a different ballgame. Research from Owl Labs in 2023 indicates loneliness is a top complaint for remote workers, who are 2.5 times more likely to feel isolated than their office-based counterparts. Adam Grant, the organizational psychologist, points out that ""Entrepreneurs thrive on connections and feedback. In a remote setup, the absence of incidental interactions – those quick chats over coffee – can magnify feelings of isolation and make problem-solving harder."" This isolation directly contributes to the global burnout crisis. Gallup's 2023 'State of the Global Workplace' report showed that 77% of employees globally reported burnout, with remote workers often feeling less connected.

Now, some might argue that 'remote work burnout' is just 'entrepreneur burnout' with a new label; the stress is inherent to building a business, regardless of location. While that's true to an extent, remote work often removes the physical escape route, making it harder to switch off. Dr. Sherry Walling, a psychologist specializing in founder mental health, warns that without proper structure and self-care, remote work intensifies pressure, making it difficult to separate one's identity from one's business, a recipe for deep burnout. For many Indian startups and solo entrepreneurs on lean budgets, coworking spaces are a luxury, forcing them into home-based remote work without mitigations (Economic Times, 2022-2023).

The key takeaway is this: the perceived freedom of remote entrepreneurship often comes with the unspoken burden of self-management. It demands intentional boundaries, proactive self-care, and a deliberate effort to build community, virtual or otherwise. Warna, jaise Dr. Michael Burchell kehte hain, 'The freedom of remote work often comes with the burden of self-management, and for entrepreneurs, this can mean a perpetual state of 'always on,' leading directly to burnout.'

What has your experience been with remote work as an entrepreneur? Have you found ways to combat the blurred boundaries, increased pressure, or isolation? I'd love to hear your stories or tips on what truly worked for you to maintain your well-being. Kya khayal hai?

After that, he asked me out for coffee as a “thank you” gesture, but I politely declined as I wasn't really interested in causal college relationships at that time. 

Recently, he added me after 3 years since graduation and keeps sending me snaps mostly scenery and places he’s visiting. I broke the pattern once and asked him if he moved to another country and he said yes and then we had a brief chat about his life there and then I ended it and wished him good luck. After that he went back to sending snaps like before. 

Even though I only open his snaps without replying, I don’t text, comment, or snap him back, he still keeps sending them. Is this some form of a snap habit or snap culture, or is he actually interested and trying to open a link? What does he want from all of this?

Social media, messengers, memes—they all eat your time, and then you wonder why the exam came so fast. But fighting procrastination is possible if you approach it the right way.

Start small. Instead of “doing everything at once,” dedicate 10–15 minutes to a specific task, then take a short break. Often, the hardest part is just starting, but once you do, momentum builds.

Organize your workspace. Remove unnecessary gadgets and keep only your study materials. A clean desk and tidy notes help your brain focus on what matters.

Another tip: set specific, measurable goals. For example, “read one chapter” or “do 10 exercises.” When a task is concrete and realistic, it’s psychologically easier to start.

Don’t forget to reward yourself for progress. Small rewards—a cup of coffee, a favorite show episode, 10 minutes on your phone—create positive motivation and help form a habit.

Most importantly, be patient. Procrastination is a habit, and habits change gradually. Take small steps every day, and soon you’ll notice that putting off studying has become almost impossible.",1,1759921354.0,StudySSpace,0,1.0,False

Ever feel like the glorious chaos of Megabonk would be even better with a friend to share it with? I certainly did, which is why I'm excited to announce a project I've been pouring the last few days into: Bonk With Friends, a true co-op multiplayer mod for the game.

The goal is simple: bring the full Megabonk experience online, letting you host and join games directly through Steam.

**What's Working Right Now? (The Fun Stuff)**

This is a huge undertaking, but the foundation is already in place and playable. As of today, the mod supports:

* **Steam P2P Lobbies**: You can host a game and invite your friends directly through the Steam overlay.
* **Synchronized Movement & Animations**: See your friends run, jump, and slide around the world in real-time.
* **Synchronized Map Seeds**: When the host starts a run, everyone connects to the exact same procedurally generated level. No more bonking on different terrain!
* **Floating Nameplates**: Easily keep track of your friends (and know who to blame when things go wrong).

**What's on the Roadmap? (The ""In-Progress"" Stuff)**  
To be fully transparent, this is a work-in-progress. The core gameplay loops are next on my list. I'm currently tackling the big systems:

* Combat synchronization (enemies, damage, abilities)
* Item and weapon pickups/states
* World interactions
* Overall stability and bug squashing

A Little About Development...  
I'm a solo developer, and like many of you, I have a 9-to-6 day job. This mod is a passion project that I'm dedicating my evenings and weekends to because I believe bonking is an activity best shared! I plan to release updates and dev-log videos roughly every two weeks to show progress.

**This is also where you can make a huge difference. If you're as excited about this as I am and want to help accelerate development, any support would be incredible. If you can't donate, sharing the post or video is helpful along with liking it. Donations help me dedicate more time and resources to the project.**

Support via Cash App: [https://cash.app/rz950](https://cash.app/rz950)

**Release Plans**  
The mod is currently a WIP. Once it's in a more stable state, it will be released for free on platforms like Thunderstore and/or Nexusmods. I'll also go opensource once we're in a stable state and codes been cleaned up.

But does it actually work? Or is it just another hyped-up bottle of nothing?

I’ve spent the past few weeks researching this supplement, reading dozens of **Mitolyn reviews**, checking for **Mitolyn reviews and complaints**, and digging into what people are saying in **Mitolyn reviews Reddit** threads. This post will give you a full breakdown of what I found so you can decide if Mitolyn is worth your money—or if you’re better off skipping it.

[**>> Ready To See If Mitolyn Actually Delivers? Start Your Own 90-Day Test—Risk-Free.**](https://d79d7et9m1pjfw7kkosdzbem3u.hop.clickbank.net/)



# 💊 What Is Mitolyn?

Mitolyn is a dietary supplement formulated to support mitochondrial health. The brand claims it can improve cellular energy, mental clarity, and overall physical performance. It typically contains ingredients like:

* **CoQ10** – For cellular energy and heart support
* **Acetyl L-Carnitine** – Promotes energy metabolism and brain function
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – An antioxidant that helps protect cells
* **B Vitamins** – Supports energy levels and nervous system health

Sounds promising, right? But what are people actually saying?

# 🧵 Mitolyn Reviews Reddit: Real Users Speak Out

Reddit is one of the few places where you can find brutally honest opinions. When you search **“Mitolyn reviews Reddit”**, the first thing you’ll notice is that the community is pretty divided. Here’s what I gathered:

**👍 Positive Reddit Reviews:**

Some users claim they’ve seen real benefits from using Mitolyn. In particular, several people in mentioned:

* **Improved focus** – Especially helpful for people dealing with brain fog or mental fatigue.
* **More energy** – Users who struggle with chronic fatigue or low motivation said Mitolyn gave them a noticeable energy boost.
* **Mood support** – A few posts suggested it helped stabilize mood or reduce anxiety.

One Redditor wrote:  
*“I’ve been using Mitolyn for about 3 weeks now, and I feel like I’m finally getting through the afternoon slump without needing more coffee. Energy feels smoother—not jittery.”*

[**>> Ready To See If Mitolyn Actually Delivers? Start Your Own 90-Day Test—Risk-Free.**](https://d79d7et9m1pjfw7kkosdzbem3u.hop.clickbank.net/)

**👎 Negative Reddit Reviews and Complaints:**

On the flip side, some users were unimpressed. Searching **“Mitolyn reviews and complaints”**, I found feedback like:

* **No noticeable effect** – A lot of people said they didn’t feel any different after using it for weeks.
* **Too expensive** – Some Reddit users felt the price point didn’t match the results.
* **Mild side effects** – A few users reported headaches or stomach discomfort after taking it.

One comment read:  
*“Honestly? Didn’t do much for me. I wanted it to help with brain fog but it was just meh. Maybe it works for others, but I’m not buying again.”*

# 🔬 Does Science Back It Up?

Looking beyond Reddit, I checked into the ingredients. Most of them have been individually studied for their effects on mitochondrial health and cognitive function:

* **CoQ10** has strong evidence for supporting heart and cell health, especially in people over 40.
* **Acetyl L-Carnitine** is often used for cognitive support and may help with mental energy.
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** is a known antioxidant with some promising anti-inflammatory effects.

So, while Mitolyn’s ingredients are backed by science, whether it “works” comes down to how your body responds to the blend. That’s probably why **Mitolyn reviews** are so mixed.

# 🛒 Where Can You Buy Mitolyn?

Mitolyn is available on its official website only . Prices vary depending on the supply (monthly vs. 3-month supply), but it’s generally in the mid to high range for supplements.

⚠️ **Pro tip:** If you’re buying from third-party sellers, double-check for authenticity. Some Reddit users warned about knock-offs or expired stock on lesser-known sites.

# 📦 Shipping, Returns, and Customer Service

While looking into **Mitolyn reviews and complaints**, a few themes came up around customer service:

* **Shipping is generally fast**, especially within the U.S.
* **Customer support is responsive** according to some, but others reported difficulty getting refunds.
* **Return policy**: Some Redditors mentioned that the return window is tight, and only unopened bottles qualify.

One user said:  
*“I tried to return it after two weeks, but they said it had to be unopened. I wasn’t thrilled with that.”*

So, if you’re on the fence, it might be smart to order just one bottle and see how you react before committing to a larger supply.

# ✅ Final Verdict: Is Mitolyn Worth Trying?

If you’re dealing with low energy, brain fog, or just looking to optimize mitochondrial health, Mitolyn could be worth a try. The ingredients are solid, and there are plenty of **Mitolyn reviews** that suggest it helps—especially for people in their 30s and older.",1,1759920823.0,YouTuber,0,1.0,False

* Farsightedness (Hyperopia) and Nearsightedness (Myopia) make your eyes overwork to focus.
* If you find yourself squinting often or struggling to read small text, that’s your first red flag.

# 2. Astigmatism

* It’s not as scary as it sounds — just means your eye’s shape bends light unevenly.
* This leads to blurry vision, eye strain, and yes, the classic “I-need-another-coffee” headache.

# 3. Digital Eye Strain

* Thanks to our screens, this has become the *modern-day eye disease*.
* Long screen hours cause dry eyes, blurred vision, and tension headaches.

# 4. Eye Fatigue (Asthenopia)

* Happens when your eyes are overused — from reading, driving, or gaming too long.
* Symptoms? Burning sensation, watery eyes, and that dull, annoying pain behind your temples.

#  Step One: Accept That You Need Help

When my headaches got worse, I realized I was doing the same thing many people do — ignoring my symptoms.  
I Googled eye clinic near me, hoping to find a place that could give me answers. And that’s when I found a trusted eye specialist in Pune.

Little did I know, that one appointment would change everything about how I see the world — literally.

#  What to Expect on Your Journey to Clearer Vision

Walking into an eye clinic can feel intimidating if it’s your first time. But it’s actually simple — and surprisingly relaxing.

Here’s what my vision journey looked like:

#  1. Initial Consultation

A quick chat about symptoms, screen habits, and medical history. The doctor asked all the right questions — how often do I use screens, do I get blurry vision, and how long have I had headaches.

#  2. Eye Tests

Next came a few painless tests.

* **Visual acuity test:** Reading letters on a chart.
* **Refraction test:** The “which lens is better, one or two?” game.
* **Slit-lamp exam:** A cool microscope view of your eye.

Each test helped uncover what was really going on.

#  3. Diagnosis

Turns out, my headaches were caused by mild eye strain and uncorrected vision. Nothing serious — just something that needed care.

#  4. The Plan

The specialist recommended simple solutions:

* Blue light glasses for screen protection.
* Regular breaks using the 20-20-20 rule (every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds).
* Proper hydration and better posture.

I walked out already feeling hopeful.

# The Expert Who Made It Simple – Dr. Rachna Tiwari

Midway through this journey, I met [Dr. Rachna Tiwari](https://g.co/kgs/KKxJsCH), a highly trusted eye specialist in Pune.  
Her approach was refreshingly human. She didn’t rush through the appointment or throw medical jargon at me. Instead, she explained *why* my headaches were happening and how small lifestyle tweaks could make a big difference.

What stood out most was her clarity and empathy.  
She guided me patiently through every test and helped me understand how vision issues impact daily productivity, mood, and even sleep.

#  Life After the Right Diagnosis

Within two weeks of following her advice, the difference was noticeable.  
No more mid-day headaches. No more squinting at my laptop.  
Even my posture improved — apparently, your body adjusts when your eyes aren’t straining.

The clarity wasn’t just in my vision; it was in my confidence too. I could focus better, read longer, and actually enjoy screen time without feeling drained.

#  Tips for Keeping Your Eyes Healthy (And Headache-Free!)

If you’re reading this, chances are your eyes could use a little love too.  
Here are a few things I’ve learned:

#  1. Take Screen Breaks

Follow the 20-20-20 rule. It’s simple but powerful.

#  2. Eat Eye-Friendly Foods

Load up on carrots, spinach, fish, and eggs — they’re packed with nutrients your eyes adore.

#  3. Stay Hydrated

Dry eyes can make strain worse. Keep sipping water throughout the day.

#  4. Sleep Well

Your eyes heal when you rest. No amount of caffeine can replace good sleep.

#  5. Get Regular Eye Checkups

Don’t wait until it hurts. Visit a trusted[ eye clinic near me](https://chetnahospital.co.in/doctor/dr-rachana-tiwari/) once a year to keep your vision in top shape.

#  Final Thoughts: Clear Vision, Clear Mind

Headaches aren’t always about stress. Sometimes, they’re your eyes whispering, “Hey, I need care!”  
Finding the right eye clinic and meeting the right specialist can truly transform how you see the world — literally and figuratively.

For me, this wasn’t just about fixing vision. It was about rediscovering comfort, clarity, and focus in everyday life.  
So if you’re tired of those stubborn headaches or blurry screens — don’t ignore the signs.

Strap in for a wild, glitter-drenched, heartbreak-soaked tear through 2010s downtown New York, where the nights bleed into dawn, the boys are pure poison, and the city’s a pulsing, seductive beast.

This is Luna Valentine, a 20-something with a razor-sharp pen, a wardrobe stuffed with vintage Versace, and a hunger to be somebody, born from a childhood of chaos— broken promises, and a parents who were more ghosts than parents.

Her boundless ambition is her armor, driving her to chase fame and love despite the cracks in her foundation. It’s about being craved—for her electric words, her killer curves, her glorious chaos—and fighting tooth and nail to crave herself above all, clawing her way back from nothing to rebuild her life.

Think steamy club bathrooms, smudged lip gloss, and a playlist of The Kills and early M.I.A., all wrapped in a haze of vodka and cocaine.

**Act 1: The Sultry Hustle**

* Luna Valentine, Downtown Siren: Luna’s 26, a freelance writer churning out sizzling stories for pop culture mags and blogs, living in a crumbling Lower East Side walk-up with a closet bursting with thrifted Gaultier that hugs her like a lover. Her unstable upbringing—bouncing between foster homes, raised on uncertainty and hand-me-down dreams—fuels her relentless drive to make a name for herself. Her life’s a whirlwind of warehouse raves, art gallery hookups, and 6 a.m. bodega runs, powered by vodka to party and cocaine to keep the night throbbing. She’s got a body that stops traffic and a wit that cuts like a knife.
* The Elite Scene: Luna’s tangled up with the downtown demigods—tattooed DJs with wandering hands, models with bedroom eyes, and trust-fund bad boys slumming it in Bushwick lofts. Her Instagram’s a steamy collage of flash-lit selfies, cigarette smoke curling around her neckline, and captions that purr I’m living the fantasy, but I’m barely holding on. She’s the girl everyone wants to bed or befriend, preferably both, her ambition a beacon that outshines her shaky past.
* The Wrong Guy, Part 1: Enter Finn, a scruffy poet with a Bushwick crash pad, a devilish grin, and a talent for pinning Luna against a wall for breathless, cocaine-fueled makeouts. Their fling is a tangle of sweaty sheets, late-night coke lines in graffitied bathrooms, and fights that end with her straddling him in a cab, lipstick smeared, heart racing. Her writing gets sharper, sexier, more electric, earning her buzz in the scene as she channels her hunger to rise above her roots.
* Inciting Incident: Luna lands a major gig—a cover story for a glossy mag about the downtown scene’s decadent underbelly. It’s her shot to go from nobody to icon, to prove she’s more than the kid who grew up with nothing. But Finn’s flaky, naughty charm is messing with her head, and she’s leaning harder on vodka to loosen up and cocaine to keep up with the nightlife’s pulse. The city’s a glittering aphrodisiac, promising the stardom she’s always craved, and she’s hooked.

**Act 2: The Steamy Spiral**

* The High: Luna’s cover story is a scorcher—her words drip with the scene’s sweaty, seductive rot, proof her ambition can outrun her past. She’s the talk of the town, snagging invites to glitzier parties and bigger gigs. Enter Luca, a roguish nightclub promoter with a Soho penthouse, a body that screams trouble, and a cocaine habit that matches hers. He’s obsessed with Luna’s allure, seducing her in velvet-rope club booths and whisking her to private Hamptons villas for weekends of champagne-soaked debauchery. One night, he’s got her against a penthouse window, city lights glittering below, whispering promises that make her weak. She’s living the wet-dream fantasy—or at least the version that slays on X.
* The Fall: Luca’s a devil in tight jeans—possessive, erratic, and way too deep into the cocaine Luna’s already snorting like it’s her job. Her writing starts slipping; she’s missing deadlines, sending drafts that read like drunken rants. Her followers can’t get enough of her hot-mess persona, but her editors are done. She’s wanted for her beauty (those hips!) and her chaotic, sex-kitten energy, but her talent’s drowning in a haze of drugs and steamy trysts. The ghosts of her unstable childhood—abandonment, distrust—creep back, whispering she’ll never be enough.
* The Breaking Point: At a Fashion Week after-party, Luna loses it—too much vodka, too much cocaine, too many bad decisions. She’s caught in a scandalous moment with Luca in a club bathroom, skirts hiked up, the flash of a phone camera catching it all. It’s all over X by dawn. Her gigs vanish, Luca bolts, and her party friends scatter like roaches. She’s alone in her apartment, surrounded by empty liquor bottles, coke-dusted takeout containers, and a laptop full of unsaved drafts, with nothing left—no career, no lover, no lifeline. Her childhood fears roar back: she’s nobody again.

**Act 3: The Sizzling Comeback**

* Sober and Broken: Luna’s hit rock bottom, with nothing but the wreckage of her life and the scars of an unstable upbringing that taught her to expect betrayal. She drags herself to AA and NA meetings in grimy church basements, clutching coffee, her hands shaking as she listens to stories that mirror her own. No rehab, no trust fund, no fairy godmother—just raw, desperate grit. Sobriety is a brutal slog, every day a fight against the urge to drown her pain in vodka or cocaine, her past whispering she’s destined to fail. She starts writing again, not for anyone else, but to survive—vivid, unfiltered stories about a fictional downtown girl who mirrors her own wild heart. Her prose is still sexy, but now it’s raw with hard-won truth.
* The Climb: From absolute zero, Luna fights to rebuild, her ambition the only thing stronger than her demons. A former colleague, a quiet editor at a small indie mag, stumbles on one of her new stories and publishes it. It’s not glamorous—just a tiny byline in a niche rag—but it’s a spark, and readers feel the heat of her steamy yet soulful take on crashing and clawing back. Each word is a battle, written through sleepless nights, cravings that claw at her, and memories of a childhood where stability was a myth. She lands small freelance gigs, not for the big names, but for outlets that crave her voice. She’s saying no to 3 a.m. temptations, choosing early mornings at her desk, sunlight warming her skin like a faint promise. Every rejection, every doubt, every urge to relapse makes the climb steeper, but her ambition—forged in the chaos of her youth—keeps her moving.
* The Success: Luna’s relentless hustle catches a literary agent’s eye, landing her a book deal for a novel about a downtown vixen’s rise and fall. It’s not the glitzy comeback she once dreamed of—it’s better, because it’s hers, earned through sweat and scars from a life that started with nothing. The final scene is Luna at a downtown bookstore, reading from her novel to a small, rapt crowd, her voice sultry but steady, each word a defiance of her past. There’s a new guy in the audience—a low-key music writer with a shy smile who likes her for her words, not her wildness—but she’s not rushing into his bed. She’s standing tall, sober, and sizzling, having rebuilt herself from the ground up, her boundless ambition finally stronger than her childhood’s shadows.

Tone and Style Notes: This is a raw, electric, unapologetically sexy novel, drenched in the sensory overload of 2010s New York—pulsing club beats, the burn of cocaine, the heat of a stranger’s breath on your neck.

Luna’s narration is witty, self-aware, and vivid, painting the city as both lover and adversary. Her unstable upbringing—foster homes, absent parents—haunts her, making her recovery from nothing a grueling odyssey, fueled only by her relentless ambition.

1o1713b,https://i.redd.it/a6o6k1lcavtf1.png,Why I Think Algo Trading Is the Smartest Move I Made,"I used to trade manually — staring at charts for hours, waiting for setups that either never came or hit my stop the second I blinked. Sound familiar?

Then I got into algo trading. I’m not talking about some magical AI bot that prints money, just a set of rules coded into an EA that follows logic without getting emotional. And honestly, it changed the way I look at trading completely.

Here’s what I’ve learned so far:

* **No emotions.** The algo doesn’t get greedy, scared, or tired. It trades exactly how it’s told, every single time.
* **Consistency beats prediction.** It’s not about guessing where the market will go, it’s about executing the same edge over and over again.
* **24/5 execution.** The algo doesn’t miss setups because you were making coffee.
* **Data doesn’t lie.** Backtesting gives you a full picture of how your strategy performs over years, not just a few trades you remember.
* **You can actually live life.** Once I trusted the system, I stopped watching every candle like a hawk.

Another thing that surprised me — even small algos can outperform manual trading *if they’re tested and managed properly*. The market’s full of noise and emotions, but an algo only listens to math.

It’s not perfect. You still need good logic, risk control, and regular updates when conditions change. But if you treat it like a business, not a slot machine, algo trading can give you freedom and consistency that manual trading rarely does.

I’m not selling anything — just sharing what worked for me after years of overtrading and frustration. If you’ve been thinking about giving algo trading a shot, start small, test everything, and be patient. It’s worth it.",2,1759920272.0,SmartEdgeTrading,0,1.0,False

Well I only found out after this woman came knocking on my door telling me to get my heart checked. Oh life been losing weight bc I am under extreme trauma at the moment but now I’m literally sick worried to my stomach about this girl who not only she used to nanny for 8 damn years but this girl babysits and hangs out with my 11 year old daughter who still has issues with her food (she is living with her evil grandmother atm).. anyways my mother literally has NEVER had a conversation with me about her eating disorder, I’ve only heard her throw up, seen her never eat, she would NEVER get food anywhere only ever pick off our plates. She would only ever get like a coffee. Only ever eat candy. All sorts of shit. My weight limited me while my skinny sister was her favorite child as if she was living though her. Well I didn’t know what to say bc I literally wanted to kick her face in so when I told her this was why it was very important I was in my daughters life (my mother has been preventing this) to ENSURE MY KIDS do not develop an eating disorder and end up hospitalized like the girl living down the street from my daughter who my mother used to be a nanny for and my mother literally deflected and just asked for the gas can and funnel… like totally I just ignored me. Made me so sick after I could barely eat. Now I have to show up at these people’s home and confront the mother to talk to her about keeping my mother Away from her kids because her advice is not helpful, is very detrimental, and she literally only wants to talk about it to feel involved or to gossip. Like she acts like a 15 year old who has been in the hospital for a week bc she lost so much weight has no impact on my kid who spends time with both her and the older sister bc they live on the same damn street.

Okay so in the dream Danny was livestreaming, and I was watching him from a flat screen on a couch in a living room. He started casually promoting some porcelain dolls he was selling on Ebay (for context, I'd fallen asleep shopping for porcelain dolls) and I frantically pulled out my phone, desperate to get Dannys porcelain dolls before anyone in the live could beat me to it. 

I found the listing and called my sister, urgently trying to explain why I needed her to send me money (I guess I'm broke in my dream), and she actually did, super slay of her.

**Commodities**

Let’s move towards coffee. Coffee markets offer rich volatility opportunities around fixed-schedule USDA World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) reports, released monthly (typically the 2nd Thursday at 12:00 PM ET). These reports provide forward-looking shocks on global coffee production (Arabica/Robusta yields in Brazil/Vietnam), exports, consumption, and ending stocks, data that's unknown pre-release but consensus estimated by analysts. Remember, please check here for the analyst you read something about:

[https://www.estimize.com/rankings/equity](https://www.estimize.com/rankings/equity) 

Surprises in production shortfalls (due to Brazilian frosts (remember the EDI formula I wrote with a Korean professor in my Bayesian booklet on Amazon sold to the IMF?).

[ https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/How-research-report-mathematics-Bayesian\/dp\/B0DWS6Y9P1 ](https://preview.redd.it/65boylol6vtf1.png?width=1698&format=png&auto=webp&s=98bf8098ddb261dfb1549a22d4a7fc8b4c527bd1)

Or worse, Vietnamese droughts) or demand revisions can trigger 3-8% moves in coffee futures over 1-3 days, spilling into the iPath Series B Bloomberg Coffee Subindex Total Return ETN (JO), which tracks coffee futures with high fidelity/accuracy.

JO = [https://www.etf.com/JO](https://www.etf.com/JO)

Unlike NFP's (remember the initial options article - [https://www.reddit.com/r/RossRiskAcademia/comments/1nzob6m/options\_the\_explanation\_of\_straddles\_strangles/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RossRiskAcademia/comments/1nzob6m/options_the_explanation_of_straddles_strangles/) ? - NFP is non farm pay rolls) - intraday equity jolts, WASDE coffee surprises digest slowly due to global timezone lags (e.g., Asian traders react overnight) and weather follow-through, making 3-7 DTE options ideal for straddles/strangles to capture multi-session vol without extreme theta burn. (DTE = day to expiration).

**Macro Economic Filters - yes, for you amigo!**

Coffee volatility isn't isolated, it isn’t. Explain to me below if you think it is! It's amplified by broader economic channels, creating a ""secondary transmission"" from macro data:

***USD Strength/Weakness***\*:\* A hawkish NFP (rate hike odds up) strengthens the dollar, pressuring USD-denominated coffee exports from producers like Brazil (world's top supplier). Consensus surprise: +5% USD rally leading to -3% JO drop as export margins squeeze.

***Inflation Linkage***: Sticky CPI (fueled by wage growth) boosts ""real asset"" narratives, supporting JO bids as an inflation hedge especially if WASDE shows tight stocks-to-use ratios (<15%).

***Energy/Weather Feed-Through***: Higher oil (from employment-driven demand) raises logistics costs for coffee shipping; pair with El Niño droughts, and supply shocks compound (Vietnam's Robusta output down 10% leading to bullish vol burst).

***Global Demand Shocks***: Chinese/EU import revisions in WASDE can ""YOLO"" prices up if emerging market consumption surprises higher.

These filters help gauge if a WASDE surprise will amplify (bearish USD + bullish stocks = vol explosion) or dampen (neutral weather = muted move) JO's reaction.

**Volatility Layer: Options on JO**

JO options trade with moderate liquidity (tighter spreads than WEAT but wider than SPY), lower baseline IV (15-25%), and asymmetric responses to supply-side shocks. Enter 1-3 days pre-WASDE when IV rank climbs to 40-60%, pricing in \~4% expected moves. Techniques mirror the agri playbook but favor longer DTE for digestion time.

https://preview.redd.it/45n3dbi5fvtf1.png?width=863&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3ed4c673355fbaf7ed8dbd0023ca7c7527ad627

JO's slower intraday vol (peaks at open/close) rewards pre-positioning 1-2 days ahead, avoiding illiquid 0DTE traps.

Historical Example: USDA WASDE Report December 2024 (Release: December 12, 2024)

\[YES I know WASDE isn’t reliable at the moment\] - but that will come back, long live US retaliations of their government (im not left nor right);

[https:\/\/www.usda.gov\/about-usda\/general-information\/staff-offices\/office-chief-economist\/commodity-markets\/wasde-report](https://preview.redd.it/ew5wb4627vtf1.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=571b0fc3d15863a1a3c9dd5c0d76a9a8a6816623)

**Consensus**: Global coffee production at 170 million bags for 2024/25, with balanced stocks-to-use (+/-14%). Actual: Production revised down to 161.5 million bags (-5% surprise), driven by Brazilian frost damage and Vietnamese yield shortfalls, creating an 8.5 million bag global deficit vs. demand.

**Market Reaction:** Coffee futures (KC) surged +6.2% over two sessions (Dec 12-13), from +/-$2.45/lb to $2.60/lb, as supply tightness fueled export panic. ETF Reaction: JO opened at $54.20 on Dec 12, rallied to $56.80 intraday (+4.8%), and closed the week at $56.50 (+4.2%), reflecting futures contango unwind and retail rebalancing. 

This shortfall surprise exemplifies how WASDE can ignite vol (vol = volatility comprendre? :P)

Realized move exceeded implied (5% vs. 3.5% priced), per historical crop report studies. USDA announcements like this boost coffee futures volatility by 20-40% post-release, with effects lingering 1-3 days (more or less).

**Hypothetical Straddle Trade**

Entry: 1 day before WASDE (Dec 11), JO at $54.20. IV elevated to 28% on front-week options.

**Position**: Buy 1 JO Dec 19 $54C for $0.85 + Buy 1 JO Dec 19 $54P for $0.75.

Total debit: $1.60 ($160 per contract).

Breakevens: Upper = $55.60; Lower = $52.60.

Max loss: $1.60 (if JO expires at $54).

Post-Report Outcome: JO gaps up to $56.00 on Dec 12 (+3.7% open), call intrinsic $2.00 (plus residual extrinsic). Exit both legs at EOD Dec 12: Call $2.20, put $0.10.

**P&L**: Call +$1.35, put -$0.65 leading to Net +$0.70 (+43.8% return on risk).

If consensus hit (no surprise), JO drifts <1%, straddle decays \~$0.04/day initially, burning to $0.60 by expiry (-62.5% loss).

**Calendar Spread Example (Vol Compression Play)**

Ahead of WASDE, front-month IV spikes to 28-32% on weather hype, while back-month lags at 18-22%. Sell the froth, buy the value.

**Trade** (Dec 11 entry, JO $54.20): Short 1 JO Dec 19 $54C (IV 30%, premium $0.85 received) + Long 1 JO Jan 16 $54C (IV 20%, $1.05 paid).

Net debit: $0.20 ($20 risk).

Objective: Front IV crush post-report (to 18%) decays short leg faster than long.

Post-WASDE: Deficit surprise spikes spot vol, but IV normalizes quickly (front to 22%, back to 24%). Front call collapses to $0.40 (you buy back cheap), back holds $1.10.

**P&L**: Short leg +$0.45, long leg +$0.05 and that leads to Net +$0.50 (+250% on debit).

If vol undershoots (mild surprise), compression alone yields +$0.30 (150% return); max loss capped at debit if sustained spike.

**Theta Burn Context in Coffee ETFs**

JO options exhibit moderate theta decay (-0.03 to -0.08/day for 7DTE ATM), slower than SPY's 0DTE fire but amplified by low liquidity (wide 5-10% spreads, OI <500). Post-WASDE, if prices stagnate 2+ sessions (e.g., futures hedgers absorb the shock without ETF follow through), both legs erode gradually straddles lose 20-30% extrinsic daily as IV crushes 10-15%. This ""slow burn"" hits harder in low-vol environments (e.g., no weather catalyst), turning a $1.60 straddle to $0.80 by day 3.

***Mitigation Tactics (risk averse that is....)***

**Event Spacing**: Trade major WASDE (June/Dec biannuals for full coffee updates) over weeklies; pair with ICO quarterly stats for confirmation.

**IV Filters**: Enter only if IV rank >50% and strangle implied move <4% backtests show 60% win rate on surprises >3%.

**Exit Rules**: Close at 40-50% max profit within 48 hours of directional break; use stops at 30% loss to cap burn.

**Sizing**: 0.5-1% portfolio risk; diversify with cocoa (NIB ETF) for correlated but distinct vol (e.g., West African supply risks).

Comparative Volatility Behaviour

|| || |**Metric**|\*\*SPY (NFP)**|**JO (WASDE Coffee)\*\*| |Event Latency|Minutes|1-3 Days| |IV Spike Pre-Event|30-50%|20-30%| |Realized Move|0.5-1%|3-7%| |Theta Burn Speed|Very Fast|Moderate| |Best Strategy|0DTE Straddle|3-7DTE Strangle|

**Volatility Sources and Macro Filters**

Coffee vol thrives on non-macro priors but amplifies via them: Brazilian real weakness (USD filter) or oil spikes (transport costs) can double realized moves. Bayesian angle: Posterior vol prob = P(surprise | weather priors) × macro multiplier (e.g., high CPI sensitivity → +20% edge).

JO's constraints, and a big one, **low liquidity** and **lagged IV adjustment.**

If you seek more info on the specifics of these options mispricing and liquidity, [www.marketchameleon.com](http://www.marketchameleon.com) is a good free website to investigate. Please do use, many more are on the internet, from a 'free average joe trader this one is by the far the best one).

Mean mispricing is real: markets underprice weather convexity, so buy vol cheap pre-event via liquid proxies like Starbucks (SBUX) calls (correlated to consumer demand shocks, deeper options book). For that you can use [https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-correlations](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-correlations) as a free website, it’s very insightful.

**Where is the edge? TELL ME THE TRADE!?**

WASDE coffee data gets mispriced due to analyst blind spots on climate yields and inefficient event vol pricing especially in CPI-hot regimes where it feeds inflation flows. Your two-legged vol bet (straddle/strangle) crushes one-legged directional plays, profiting on realized > implied, regardless of up/down. Win - win.

**Where to kick off?**

Focus liquid *(else you already lose before you start)*: JO for direct exposure, SBUX calendars for proxy depth. Systematize with supply (WASDE stocks), energy (oil hedges), and inflation channels, Canada/Australia proxies (e.g., Viterra rail stocks) add global flavor, but U.S.-centric for Reddit vibes. WEAT/CORN/SOYB are ETFs aren't as strong on liquidity for example.

We now did 3 articles on option trading, which is something you might believe. Wrong. We did 3 articles on the perception of sheep herd behaviour of human beings who want to have control or a grasp of control how society works. That is based on external information. Like macroeconomic data from the government. Why Canada and Australia?

Why? Because OECD is your friend as a retail trader as well as a hedge fund or a bank trader;

Australia and Canada are must knowns for wheat traders. This tells you why wheat is important, but mostly out of Canada (and you can then think of stocks which moves it) - like the canadian rail road stocks, or Australia (like NuFarm.ASX) - a stock I’ve held in the past.

[https://oec.world/en/profile/hs/wheat](https://oec.world/en/profile/hs/wheat)

This website gives everything a macro economic trader needs.

Why straddles, strangles and calendar spreads? Because you exploit human nature. Human nature wants control and knowing whats going on. Whether it’s good or bad they don’t comprehend (for good or worse). Henceforth, these volatility boxes gives you the idea that you invest in people who shout (SELL) or (BUY), and as a volatility trader this is how you make money!

So if you are interested in wheat: canada and australia is where your focus should be; start with listed stocks in Canada;

*Disclaimer: This was spoken during my commute and kindly formatted by ChatGPT so I could just paste it here. So blame them for any elegance, not me!*
Hey everyone, I wanted to share my recent ride through the world of trademarking a game studio and a game title. Spoiler alert: it was a bit of a circus, but here’s the scoop.

So I found this highly recommended trademark service—Company A—that charged me $299 per trademark. Sounded reasonable, right? Except after I paid the $600 total, they passed me off to Company B. Company B wanted me to do a video call and share my screen to create a USPTO account with them. In other words, they basically wanted to hold my hand through something I could easily do myself.

By the time I realized that Company A did nothing but forward my application and charge me for it, I was already knee-deep. Then Company B wanted extra fees and was basically just going to click through the USPTO website with me. Needless to say, I noped out of that, got a refund on Company A, and went straight to the USPTO site myself.

Guess what? It took me like 20 minutes to create my account, verify my info, and another 10 minutes tops to submit the trademark. Doing the second one took even less time. The USPTO site was super clear, and I didn’t need a middleman. Plus, they warned me multiple times about these so-called services. Apparently, I was just paying to have my hand held through something I could do myself with a cup of coffee and a little patience.

So here’s my takeaway: if you’re in the U.S. and need a trademark, skip the extra services. Seriously, you’re making a game; you can definitely handle a few website forms. Good luck out there, and go create something awesome!

Me and this guy had this crazy chemistry for months, we work together and because of our bad home lives we decided to move in together. I love living with him! We cook food together watch shows, go out for lunch sometimes etc. in the middle of that I started to fall for him, confessed my feelings and got rejected. I’m pretty mature about this stuff and said that I really liked our connection and would start seeing it as a good friendship from now on. 

THEN his friend started to joke that I was the one for him, calling me pookie and showing up to my house with my favourite flowers! I am 22 years old and have had 2 very serious long term relationships and never in my life have I had someone remember a detail so specific like my favourite flowers, then bring them to me unprompted just to make me smile. We went for coffee one day and I realised that everything I say to him he remembers and asks me about but - girls will know what I mean here - REALLY asks my opinion and all these little details that makes me question a lot. 

We both have similar interests and joke and have fun together. The issue? I’m displaying these flowers in my shared house with my old crush … 

I see his face drop every time he sees the flowers, he always jokes about me and his friend how it’s a “really good joke” etc. 

A part of me wonders whether the guy I live with is holding back because he is scared of commitment, trying to understand his feelings and now is watching me go out and have fun? And another part of me is wondering whether I go an pursue this thing with his friend because he’s been kinder to me in the past week than almost any man has treated me.

I'm looking for love on the internet, what could possibly go wrong? 😅
Here's a little intro to tell you about myself! 😄

Appearance: 6'2"" (188 cm) tall, brown hair, greenish eyes, clean shaven, broad shoulders, loves graphic t-shirts, hoodies, cargo pants, Vans/Addidas, and nice suits, decently in shape but still have some work to do (not a gym bro, just want to be healthy) :)

Personality Type: ENFJ ""The Protagonist""

Hobbies: cooking (mostly Korean food because I'm 1/4th Korean! But I also make great dessert!), learning about history, going to new places, hiking, night time drives, car shows/meets, movies/tv/anime/kdrama/kpop, a few nerdy fandoms (something we can discuss 👀)......and last but not least.....I really like cars and racing....like a lot :3

Life Goals: In 3rd year of Instrumentation and Control Systems Engineering Bachelor's, going to do Master's in Electrical Engineering! I want to work in electrical systems in planes and vehicles for the Air Force Civilian Service! That way I can do what I love and get paid and get to travel, it's a win win :D

Romance Goals: I will be honest...I've never dated before. I never found anyone I vibed with but also I've always been very busy. But lately, I've been feeling like I finally want to open up and share my life with someone.
Someone who's kind. Someone who I can be equal partners with. Someone who will support me through thick and thin (and I'll do the same). Someone I can go on fun adventures and make a scrapbook with. Someone who loves movie marathon nights, bookstore dates, walks through museums, and the quiet corner of a coffee shop or Korean BBQ place. Someone who will put up with my corny jokes and lore dumping. Someone who tells corny jokes and lore dumps right back. Someone I'd love to spend the rest of my life showing that they mean the world to me....and that they are loved ❤

I know that sounded a bit sappy but my mom said Pride and Prejudice is my romance guide so I'm sorry I sound like an English gentleman from the 1800s 😭

I really hope this gave you a good look at who I am and that I made a good first impression! Hopefully you can see that I really want something genuine and special, and that I'm willing to work for it 😌

**tl, dr: i work for a year as project manager in a medical society, i earn 2800 brutto, i don't know which arguments to use and how much more to ask for.**

**detailed version follows** 

This is my first real job experience, both in general and in Austria: I started working about one year ago as a Project Manager in a medical society, while previously I worked only freelance or in contexts that didn't really allow salary increases - both experiences outside Austria

My colleagues mentioned that towards the end of the year, there’s usually an opportunity to negotiate a salary increase directly with the CEO. However, I’ve never done this before, and I have the feeling that if I don’t bring it up myself, he probably won’t initiate the discussion

  
I’d like to understand what’s considered reasonable or expected in Austria for a first salary negotiation, like how much I can realistically ask for and what arguments or reasonings tend to work culturally here

  
Some hard facts: 

* Right now, I earn approx 2050 netto, 2800 brutto
* I picked up things up quickly and my performance overall has been good
* I’ve received very positive feedback from both external partners and internal colleagues - they say I’m easy to work with, proactive, and bring good ideas to the table with good execution
* But I hardly ever do overtime. I mention this because I was told that our CEO often checks overhours during salary reviews. However, that’s mainly because I manage to stay focused and get everything done within my 8-hour day - no chitchatting, no coffee breaks, etc
* If it's of any relevance, I take part to company events and social gatherings
* My ideas for arguments were mentioning about my performance, motivation or maybe even talking about inflation? Does it even make sense?

I would really appreciate if you could give me your tips or share your experiences in how to bring up this topic, how much I can reasonably aim for in this situation and which arguments should I use. I really don't wanna waste this opportunity!

A noble goal. But it's not actually what these groups do, they mostly just make the autistic kids make coffees, work as waiters for corporate retreats, gardening, as well as other jobs--These kids aren't paid, in fact they pay the organizations to work (usually with their NDIS money.) It's very predatory stuff as these kids don't fully know that they are being taken advantage of and the workers of these businesses put on a very kind face, and most of these kids are just desperate to work due to believing they are burdens on the family.

Onto the more juicy shit:

There are talks that one of these businesses will get a defense contract meaning they will send the welding students to go work on the nuclear submarines Australia is making as part of AUKUS.
