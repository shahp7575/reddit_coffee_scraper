Last week, I was walking through my neighborhood and saw a sidewalk repair crew working in the early morning light. There was something almost cinematic about the way they moved together: methodical, quiet, and completely absorbed in what they were doing. If this were on 16mm, I’d imagine the grain catching every sunbeam, every bead of sweat, every small gesture.

It made me think about all the other essential but invisible work happening around us, caregivers, tradespeople, waste & recycling crews. Most of the time, we pass by without noticing. Yet these are the people whose labor keeps life steady, and there’s a kind of beauty in that quiet reliability.

I recently came across ꓑеорꓲеꓪоrtһꓚаrіոցꓮbоսt, which documents these kinds of stories. The way they capture ordinary people doing extraordinary, unnoticed work reminded me a lot of why I love 16mm: it’s honest, textured, imperfect, and human. The small moments, a hand adjusting a railing, a patient smile, a careful gesture, feel like the kind of details film was made to hold onto.

After that morning, I found myself looking differently at everyday work: the janitor moving silently through the library, the barista taking a little extra time with a coffee, the crossing guard waving at kids. It’s subtle, it’s quiet, but it’s all around us. And sometimes, just noticing it feels like the most cinematic thing you can do.",1,1765123835.0,16mm,0,1.0,False

I’m hoping to get some input on suburbs that might suit our situation. Here’s what we’re looking for:

Home
- Budget up to $3.5M (looking to buy)
- We both work from home and need a large house: 5 bedrooms plus an office
- Prefer a nice setting either leafy, hilly, or near water
- Looking for a big outdoor area/large block, possibly even semi-rural

Neighborhood
- Somewhere with character and friendly vibes
- A small community is totally fine, but it’d be great to have a couple of restaurants or coffee shops nearby
- Easy access to the outdoors (walking, jogging, swimming)

School
- Looking for a solid high school (preferably state, but open to private)
- Doesn’t need to be fancy, just reliable and well-regarded

Kids
- Our kids are sporty, and soccer is their main sport
- They currently play competitive club soccer in the USA and hope to continue developing at a competitive level

Work
- We mainly work from home but will need to commute into the Brisbane office occasionally (CBD for me, Fortitude Valley for my partner)
- Easy access to the airport is important for work travel
- We’re fine with commuting up to ~90 minutes to the office and ~60 minutes to the airport

Here, take my jacket.
I won't take long I promise.
Just a little brainstorming session.
Yes it is quite the view from up here.
You can just see some stars above the lights of the city.
Hmmm
So on to business.
Your friend told me some of what happened.
But I would like to hear from it from you.
[L]
Oh, wow. Hes that sort?
And you put up with it for 3 years?
You are a VERY patient person.
It seems that he needs a reality check or two.
So how would you like to approach this.
[L]
Well it may surprise you but this isn't my first time.
Being arm candy for a jilted lover.
Usually we come up with a background we can play off of.
{These scenarios can be changed}
For example once I was the owner of a 5 star Resort in Monaco. And the first time I saw her while walking on the beach it was love at first site and we'd inseparable ever since.
Another time I was a Count from Luxembourg who was oh so lonely and heartbroken, so when we met I knew my life had found its purpose.
We come up with scenarios to play off of. It's easier to be the perfect couple if we get our story straight first.
Then as we play our parts we really get under there Ex's skin and make them squirm and regret. 
All the good stuff from some petty revenge.
Do they get back together?
Well some do, others don't.
I'm just there to make revenge feel
Oh
So
Good.
[L]
Whatever you want. I am up for most scenarios.
Whatever makes you most comfortable.
[L]
Hmmmm
So
We met at the park. Spent a magical day together drinking coffee, bookstores, thrift shopping, and a movie under the stars.
Hahaha
That blush is adorable my dear.
No, its not strange.
Just, unexpectedly mundane.
It sounds like the beginning of a rom-com.
[L].
Ohhh
He never took you on dates like that.
A lot of company and client dinners. Paraeded you in front of stiff shirts and the like.
So an ordinary date is what you are looking for.
Hmmmm
I like it.
But you know what would make it even better?
Actually going on your perfect rom-com date.
You can have some fun and do the things you like.
We'll take some “candid” pictures.
Rub some salt in that wound.
[L]
Than it's settled.
This coming Saturday at 10 well meet at Nouveau Coffee House to start off our perfect date.
In the mean time here is my number in case any other ideas come to mind. Please do not hesitate to let me know.
[Whisper]
Your blushing again my dear.
[kisses hand]
Let's get back inside out this cold.
[Music starts again]
Unfortunately I have  another engagement to attend to.
Till Saturday my dear.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
Hmmm
BFF:
SOOOO???
How'd it go???
[L]
A date Saturday? Like a real one?
He didn't seem like the type

1pglrcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Metaphysics/comments/1pglrcb/plotinus_worry_and_perceptual_oddities/,Plotinus' worry and perceptual oddities,"Plotinus asks how is it that distant objects appear small. We can extend this question and ask: how is it that near objects appear large? What explains the systematic relation between the size of an object in perception and the object's distance from the perceiver? Ordinarily, a cup of coffee sitting on a table appears smaller than when I pick it up and bring it closer to my face. This is such a familiar fact of perceptual life that we overlook its oddity. Presumably it could, after all, have been otherwise. We can imagine a world in which objects appeared larger at a distance and smaller when near. Why then, do things appear as they do in this world?

There are many technical accounts we can appeal to such as optical, physiological, computational, and so forth, but the structural point is that an embodied creature occupies a specific region of space and uses its sensory organs to orientate itself within that region. The body has a determinate position, a perceptual field with a certain spatial geometry, and sensory capacities constrained by the physical form of the organism. The perspectival structure of vision is tied to the body's spatial location, the optics of its sensory organs, and the physical fact that light spreads out in space. 

Consider a disembodied perceiver. If a perceiver has no body, can it have a spatial location? Would it experience objects as nearer or farther? I think the answer to the last question might partially depend on spatial situatedness. If the perceiver is disembodied but still located in space, say, like a point of awareness, then it might still experience perspectival distortions Plotinus worried about. So, we would have to argue that geometry of perception depends on being a point in space rather than having a body. But even a mathematical point of observation inherits the inverse square or perspective relations. It seems then that the view is defensible. Whatever disembodied perceiver were, given it had a spatial location, it would have some inbuilt perspectival structure in virtue of being situated at a point in space. Viz., even without a body, the very fact of occupying determinate location would impose constraints on how things appear. Namely, there would be a *here* relative to which objects could be nearer, farther, larger, smaller, centered or peripheral. Iow, a spatial vantage point automatically generates a rudimentary geometry of perception, even in the absence of bodily organs or embodied constraints. 

The claim is that whatever form a disembodied perceiver takes, if it nonetheless has a definite position in space, it would inherit a kind of protoperspectival intrinsic orientation. Spatial location thus would impose asymmetries. The further claim is that embodiment would modify this structure but location alone would suffice to generate it.


What about a disembodied perceiver with no spatial location at all? It seems that this one would have an entirely different awareness. Concepts such as near, far, large, small, etc., would fly off the table. Nevertheless, given that spatial relations between objects would still hold, none of them would be defined relative to the perceiver since the perceiver would have no distance to anything. A perceiver without spatial location would not experience the world via spatial appearance, so it wouldn't *see* objects from anywhere, but at best, apprehend them with no spatial mediation, something like us thinking about abstract objects. So, it appears that a non-located perceiver wouldn't be a perceiver at all, but a *knower*. It would be in a state of *Socratic gnosis*, which is an immediate non-sensory grasp of things and truths about things without a visual viewpoint, distance or orientation. Maybe this knower is ""surrounded"" by basic concepts, and whichever it picks and combines, it knows, rather than *sees*, every actual exemplification all at once. But there seems to be a way of saving the perceptual feature of this knower. One possibility is that it doesn't actually perceive objects in space in any direct way, but it only directly perceives qualities, and since no object could be perceived if qualities aren't involved, it would indirectly know their spatial properties and relations. Anyway, there are other, perhaps better ways to go around this. 


Prima facie, there might be some problems with all that. For example, a dreamer has a visual experience of objects as nearer or farther, larger and smaller, without actually occupying a determinate position in a physical space. In a dream, I might see a building shrinking in the distance or hand looming close to my eyes, but my body is lying motionless in bed and my eyes aren't directed at anything. Surely, in REM phase, eyes can move but that's beside the point. The point is that the perspectival structure of the dream doesn't come from the geometry of the external world nor from the physical optics of the eyes. It seems that it arises from an internal organization of visual experience. This complicates the simple claim stated above, namely that being located in space grounds perspective in some fashion. The experience certainly feels spatial. Another problem is that the very basic visual experience does not involve spatiality. This doesn't seem to be a problem for a nonlocated disembodied perceiver. 

One counter would be that objects in dreams are typically unordered unlike the objects in the external world. Thus, the ""spatial"" relations among objects in dreams don't obey the constraints of physical space. So one could argue that dream objection doesn't show that perspective can exist without being located, only that mind can simulate it, but the simulation depends on having an anchor. Moreso, the fact that the orderliness makes the actual distinction between these two types of experiences, enforces the point. ",1,1765122999.0,Metaphysics,0,1.0,False

5’6, 150lbs, I workout 3-4 times consistently every week.  I’m mainland southeast Asian.  Mixed with a few actually so if you want to know which ones, just ask.  I was born in the states though so I’m as American as it gets.

I’m pretty emphatic when it comes to all the bullshit happening in the world.  It’s sad seeing the reality of what’s going on.  We’re no different than monkeys slinging shit at each other.  We just do it on a bigger scale.  We’re still primitive as a species but I have hope that one day we’ll grow and evolve past all this.  

I enjoy the little things in life.  A cup of coffee every morning.  Decompressing after a long week of work.  Laying in bed on the weekends until I’m ready to get up.  I’m into a plethora of things.  Pokémon cards/plushies, video games, sneakers, clothes, anime, mangas, guns.  I’ve watched majority of marvel movies multiple times.  Just finished re-watching the Harry Potter series and now I’m starting on LOTR again(extended edition 😉).  I love being outside as much as I do being inside.  I love the beach, the mountains, the city, the country.  A beach trip every year is mandatory.  I had the chance to fly out a few times to go snowboarding earlier this year and as long as I’m physically fit enough that will probably become an annual thing now.  

My main goal in life now is to leave the world a little better once I’m gone.  For my daughter and future generations.  Just spreading/promoting love and kindness.  Doesn’t matter if I only make a difference in one persons life throughout my whole lifetime.  Every bit counts.  

What am I looking for?  I’m pretty easy/simple.  Someone average looking who’s skinny.  I don’t need a “baddie” or someone to flaunt to the world.  I just want my person.

1pgln6r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pgln6r,Matcha - MK Aoarashi vs Tea Dealers Shouraku vs Bitterleaf Premium Dose,"**Prologue:**

What a surprise to find MK Aoarashi at my Japanese market at a normal pre-matcha-trend price ($20 for the tin). I happened to be at the Japanese market due to being far too lazy to make dinner, and honestly, the prepared ramen is really good.

I had not planned to do this as three-way comparison as I had already picked up Shouraku from Tea Dealers earlier this week. Being that my husband has also been asking for matcha drinks and we had some people over, having 3 tins open at the same time was somewhat okay for me.

Also, doing these types of reviews alongside others really helps with my brain. Notes and differences I probably would not have picked up on if I did this individually.

Both MK and Tea Dealer selections are noted that they can be used for latte-style drinks. Bitterleaf Premium Dose is meant for usucha.

**Preparation:** 3g powder to 40g water at 75C (6g water for paste, 34g water for whisking). Sweet pairing was a freshly made glazed donut instead of my usual dates.

**Review**

Thing to note that was highly obvious as I did this was the freshness of the matcha from milling date to cup, to which, I understand that some still think is a moot point. I would like to say that as we enter third-wave matcha and third-wave tea, I think more and more people will start to come around that freshly milled matcha is where we are going when it comes to high quality cups. No different than freshly ground coffee when it comes to coffee and espresso.

For this, I am assuming that both Bitterleaf and MK were milled this past summer. Tea Dealers latest milling was early November for their restock.

*Color*

MK is the classic matcha green.

Tea Dealers came in more vibrant and deep.

Bitterleaf, if it wasn't compared side-by-side, I highly doubt anyone would be able to say it was a ""Chinese matcha"". Its green is comparable to many other Japanese matchas. Slightly less vibrant than MK... with the slightest tinge of yellow if you really looked for it.

*Swipe*

MK coming in with a silky and clean swipe.

Tea Dealers also the same as MK with the only difference in it being noticeably ""creamy"" on the touch.

Bitterleaf was the least clean swipe, but still silky and still super fine. Not gritty. On touch, it seems ""fluffy"".

*Froth/Microfoam*

All three foamed up easily and beautifully, with colors to match their powders.

*Fragrance Notes*

MK had that hint of floral on the nose with a light vegetal scent

Tea Dealers was quite fragrant with nutty and sweet notes immediately, followed with a vegetal scent that was like a heavy, dewy grass

Bitterleaf had the lightest fragrance notes, but I could still smell the notes of snowpeas. This is what makes me think this was the oldest milled of the three.

*Fragrance on usucha*

MK had notes of fresh snow peas, spring flowers, and slight nori.

Tea Dealers smelled creamy, nutty, and seaweedy. Unsure why it reminded me of sesame oil drizzled on onigiri, but it did.

Bitterleaf's scent was vegetal with a slight sharpness and slight sweetness with a floral background.

*Tasting*

MK was creamy and nutty forward. Finishes with a lingering floral. High umami. It was almost like a tea perfume in my mouth with the floral and slight sharpness. There were some vegetal notes within that. After tasting with a sweet pairing, the savory notes became amplified and intense.

Tea Dealers was nutty, savory, creamy, silky, and buttery. This was the most enjoyable of the three for me. After the sweet pairing, those notes became more intense

Bitterleaf had a very slight astringency on the tongue. Floral forward but grassy and a hint of citrus. The bitterness came after, with the nutty umami being last and most intense. Creamy and silky on texture. This was lighter and more delicate against MK. The floral notes became more intense after the pairing of a sweet treat.

**Overall**

I enjoyed Tea Dealer's Shouraku the most. I could drink this happily as usucha. I have done some latte drinks with it, and it is also enjoyable. It can break through the plant milks and sweeteners (at least the ratios I use).

MK Aoarashi came second for me. As a tea possibly blended for lattes, it works for that as well. I have no qualms on picking up a tin from the market to scratch that craving if I have none.

Bitterleaf Premium Dose - this is a fantastic showing for Chinese matcha. If I'm doing a tea order from Bitterleaf, I will probably add some Premium Dose depending on my current stash. I will say that if someone is tasting this without being told it was Chinese matcha, they wouldn't know. This can compete against many Japanese matchas and highlights that Chinese produced matcha is something to seriously consider.",2,1765122720.0,tea,1,1.0,False

I couldn't really buy that I just couldn't get a cup of coffee that I love out of it. Tried a bunch of stuff and nothing was working. 

Then I tried a variation of go-to pulsar recipe and it all clicked. I have now tested this with several coffees from Leaves, Sey, Prodigal, and Morgon. Works every time, with the best cups of coffee I have made at home.

If you have a Z1, give this a go.

Ratio - 1:17 (15g coffee/255g water)

0:00 - 1:00 - Bloom with 50g. Faster pour. Sometimes I give it a little twist to make sure everything is saturated

1:00 - Pour up to 100g then try and maintain the water height. Keep it steady or pulse at a very slow flow rate. Just try your best to maintain it.

TDT - 2:00 - 2:45ish

Really easy, will be my daily driver for the foreseeable future. Would love if others tried this out and also gave their thoughts

I just lose all energy at home, so I think I need to finish this outside. What I’m looking for is someone I can work with while doing this project, maybe in a coffee shop, a coworking space, or anything. You can work, study, or whatever.

I won’t finish it in one sitting so I’d be grateful if we can be friends and do this until I finish it. Although, I don’t really mind if I do it with a different person each day.

I’m employed so I’ll only be available after work (4PM) this month on the following weekdays: 10, 11, 18, 19, 22, 23, and available all day on the following weekends: 13, 20, 21.

- Graduated earlier this year, got employed not long after
- A little introverted but very easy to approach and communicate with
- An open book, would yap about myself if given the chance
- Somewhat good listener, would love to hear you yap about yourself
- Kaladkarin, invite me anywhere, I will NOT say no to a good time
- From Sampaloc/Ermita, Manila
- My interests that might be of interest to you: Crochet, Knitting, Sci-Fi shows/books, Film Photography (newbie)

What I’m looking for:
- Preferably around the same age as I am
- Has stuff to do/work on while I crochet (bonus if you’re crocheting too)
- Easy to talk to or a yapper
- Doesn’t mind silence, especially once “in the zone”

Put in your coffee dose and it auto-calculates all the water amounts:

\- Bloom (50g for 15g dose)

\- Pour to 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%

\- The famous swirl at the end

The timer walks you through each step with calculated amounts and timings. No more mental math mid-brew.

You just message expenses as you spend (like ""coffee $4"" or snap a receipt photo), and it auto-categorizes everything.  
  
But the cool part is you can actually talk to it — ask ""how much did I spend on groceries this month?"" or ""what should I cut back on?"" and it gives personalized advice based on your spending patterns.

It's been helpful for staying consistent because I can log things immediately AND get insights on demand. Works in Telegram, no complex setup.

I am 25 and currently living in Germany, in beautiful Bavaria. I have an interview for a temporary job in Portland, and if things go well, I might be moving across the ocean sometime soon. I am trying not to plan my whole life in advance ( fingers crossed though 🤞) but it feels exciting to imagine a fresh start in such a unique place. Since I would be moving on my own, it would be nice to already know a few friendly faces and not feel like I am wandering into a completely new world with only a suitcase and Google Maps.

I study German Literature and I work at an airport, and yes, I genuinely love it ✈️ I am around people all day, and random conversations turn into stories I treasure. I am quite empathetic, I love positive energy, and I enjoy people who feel warm and natural. I would describe myself as outgoing and sensitive in a good way, someone who loves laughter but also real conversations over tea or coffee ☕✨

In my free time, I adore being outside, especially in cozy and peaceful places like forests, lakes and little scenic spots that feel like they belong in a gentle folk song 🌾 I love taking photos, going to concerts, listening to country music, and having relaxed game nights or movie evenings. I am not an intense hiker, but give me trees, quiet paths, soft sunlight, and a camera, and I am happy. I already have a growing list of places in Oregon that I want to explore.

I am in a committed relationship, six years now, so I am only looking for friendships with people roughly around my age. Nothing romantic at all. I simply hope to meet kind humans to talk to, maybe explore the area with someday, and share a few memories over time.

I usually connect with people through Instagram because I like putting faces to conversations, and it is the platform where I am most active. So if you feel like chatting, sharing tips, or maybe meeting for a walk, live music, or a cozy cup of coffee if I move, feel free to message me. I would love to exchange Instagram privately 📩🪻 Even if life ends up taking me somewhere else, it would already feel nice to connect with warm people from Oregon.",1,1765122104.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

1pglclb,https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/s1eq56czbx,Inside the Zingboim family empire: How Israel’s 'Kardashians' built cosmetics powerhouse,"**In their first joint interview, cosmetics mogul Hava Zingboim and her daughters — often dubbed Israel’s Kardashians — discuss balancing business, faith and family, setting boundaries and why science outweighs flashy advertising**

In a first profile published about her in 2009 in Yediot Ahronot’s “Where’s the Kid?” column, cosmetician Hava Zingboim described her daily routine: she woke up every morning at 5:15 to make sandwiches for her six children, headed to the gym, dropped them off and, by six, “was back home with the kids for homework, tests and school assignments.”

Since then, she sleeps even less. “Today I wake up at three in the morning,” she says. “Between three and five, I read, study and write. People get emails from me at insane hours.”

“Emails at four a.m.,” confirms her daughter, Emuna Ganz. “Those are usually the most important and serious ones.”

Fifteen years have passed since that article. Today, she runs the skin-tech corporation “Hava Zingboim,” which blends science and aesthetics. On Sunday, the brand unveiled its new Prophecy series before hundreds of cosmeticians who work with her, aiming to replicate the success of previous products in the line.

While celebrities like Bar Refaeli promote injecting salmon sperm into the face, Zingboim is less drawn to fleeting trends. She developed the new product, made of cross-linked hyaluronic acid, after encountering a study about three years ago.

“In MRI images of the skin, they saw that injected hyaluronic acid stays in the tissue under the skin for years,” she explains. “It was a stunning discovery. It’s a major shift, because unlike silicone, until now we treated hyaluronic acid as a substance the skin absorbs.”

Cross-linked hyaluronic acid undergoes a chemical bonding process that makes it thicker and more durable. According to Zingboim, Prof. Rachel Lubart and Dr. Lipovsky from the company’s R&D department managed to shrink the acid’s molecule without breaking its cross-linked structure.

“Once the acid stays deep in the skin for a long time, it triggers processes we now call biosimulation — renewing tissue at the skin’s depth,” Zingboim says. “In the injected areas and in areas where the hyaluronic acid remained, they detected increased production of collagen and anti-inflammatory compounds.”

After a series of tests, the company developed three products that she says deliver significant improvements to the skin’s appearance and “age” within two weeks: a gel cream, a serum and a rich cream. “We were shocked by the results. Within two weeks, there’s a drop in chronological age — wrinkle depth, fine lines, texture,” Zingboim says. “This isn’t just another cream. This is serious work by our R&D department.”

**What does that mean for the consumer?**

“Now she can apply cross-linked hyaluronic acid to the skin and stimulate collagen production. Today, to encourage collagen, we do invasive treatments like microneedling. Creating collagen naturally in the skin is completely new. It’s another step in what we used to call anti-aging and now call longevity.”

**A term that has become a major trend.**

“Longevity represents a major conceptual shift in our field. In anti-aging treatments, a patient comes to a doctor or cosmetician, and they’ll do everything to make the skin look better. Longevity is a completely different mindset. We want to ensure the skin reaches old age in peak health and help it perform its natural processes better. It’s a different perspective, not a trend.”

**It certainly feels like a trend being pushed from all directions. How did it suddenly catch on?**

“Because of new studies about aging, as well as research on nutrition and sports. These are constantly studied fields, huge industries, and the research drives a shift in how we think about lifespan and quality of life — not just appearance.”

**Can you promise that in two weeks I’ll look younger?**

“I don’t like promising things, and I’m very careful with that, but studies show rejuvenation in skin age. The skin looks younger, pigmentation improves, hydration levels rise and it’s more radiant.”

**We live in an age flooded with information — and misinformation — especially online. Who should I trust?**

“I’m in the same place. I also ask myself, ‘Should I let this information influence what I do?’ So I check who’s giving me the information. Like in any field, there are credible sources and serious researchers who’ve worked for many years. Then I check if others at that level say the same.”

**So we won’t be injecting salmon sperm into our faces.**

“No, that won’t happen. Why? Because if we’re talking about DNA fragments, you’re talking to me about fish DNA? I’m not a fish. There are things I ruled out from the start, like collagen supplements. For years, it didn’t make sense to me, and I didn’t take them. But twenty years passed, and studies came out showing that in certain conditions, with certain diets, it works. For now, I say: eat fresh salmon because it has proteins that enrich your diet — more than rubbing it on your face or injecting it.”

**Speaking of trends, we’re in an era where many influencers and celebrities launch skincare brands. You may be well-known, but they’re stronger than you on social media.**

“It’s like a chef preparing food for takeaway. He knows the chemistry, how food keeps over time, how to preserve its qualities. Then someone else with no knowledge arrives and cooks too. I respect anyone who opens a business, especially women — but you can’t compare that to someone who’s spent 30 years in the field and researches it. Unlike them, I work with skin, I treat people, I teach cosmeticians, I see their results. It’s work that is — I won’t say on a different level, okay? — but it’s different.”

Zingboim stresses that the new product is not meant to replace injectables, but to offer another option — one that can complement injections or serve as an alternative for those who don’t want a swollen look. She herself reduced fillers at age 50 because she didn’t like the appearance, and stopped entirely over the past year and a half.

“I see the growing demand for products that deliver quick results,” she adds. “People want instant, now, immediately. They don’t have time. And the age keeps dropping, so we’re seeing more and more products tailored for younger ages. Very young.”

**Fourteen to sixteen?**

“Younger. Ten, eight. They’re already talking about four-year-olds. There’s a company in the United States (Rini, co-owned by actress Shay Mitchell) that just launched face masks for four- and five-year-old girls. Today, girls aged ten and eleven are cosmetics consumers.”

**'Being part of the family business obligates you'**

The interview with Zingboim takes place at the company’s Ramat Gan offices, where her school sits alongside the training, research and development divisions. It is an empire. In each arm of the business, Zingboim has placed one of her four daughters. All identify somewhere along the religious spectrum — some with uncovered hair, some with wigs — and all live within a short radius around her in Ra’anana. Zingboim also has two sons (“the youngest is just now leaving home,” she says with a hint of sadness) and 13 grandchildren, including one-month-old Libi, who joins the interview as well.

The maternal umbilical cord has never really been cut, and for the first time, the women sit together for a joint interview about business, family, faith and the label often attached to them: “the Israeli Kardashians.” As with Kris Jenner, Zingboim’s daughters see their mother as a “momager.” “Sometimes I watch the Kardashians, hear Kris talk and say to myself: that’s Mom!” says Hodiya Matatia, 29, the company’s brand manager and head of social media.

“I don’t know if you watch,” adds Sapir Solomovitz, 36, a mother of four, formerly the VP of marketing and now in business development. “No matter how strong Kris is, she cries in a second. I love how composed and polished she is, and in a split moment, you say something emotional, and she just breaks down.”

Zingboim’s eldest daughter, Bat-El Gross, 38, a mother of six, was the first to join the business. She had planned to be an English teacher at a Bnei Akiva yeshiva in Ra’anana until she was called in. Later came the youngest daughter, Emuna Ganz, 25, a mother of one and now VP of R&D. Their father, Moti, is also involved. It is a family business where the work never really ends — even when they go home and close the door on the day.

“Being part of the family business obligates you. You’re not an employee in an office,” says Solomovitz. “We live and breathe it. We exchange messages, references, ideas. There are advantages — when I talk to my mom, I can also bring something up about my daughters and grab a quick coffee. We’re together at my parents’ house every Shabbat, and the next day we’re back at work. My husband always says, ‘Don’t you get tired of it?’ No, I don’t. You learn to balance personal, family and professional. So what if yesterday I yelled at her and hung up on her? You learn to set boundaries.”

**What’s the boundary?**

Matatia: “Shabbat. For my father, it’s very important that on Shabbat we don’t talk about work, don’t think about work. It’s sacred time.”

**Was it obvious to all of you that you’d join the business? Was this path set in advance?**

Matatia: “I never imagined I’d work here. After national service, everyone assumed I’d join the family business, but for me it wasn’t an option. I wanted to work in marketing, just not necessarily here — but one thing led to another. It’s a huge privilege to learn from our parents and work together as a family. We have a lot of disagreements, and we have to rise above them and say — what a privilege it is that we even get to argue about work. It’s not a fight; it’s a different way of looking at things.”

**Do you think Hava would have allowed you to choose another path?**

Matatia: “Look, each of us is doing another degree, each of us studies, each has another niche in life. I teach bridal classes and work as a mikveh attendant, and I’m doing a master’s in Bible studies.”

Solomovitz: “I resigned once and went to work at a startup because I felt I needed experience in other fields — and then I came back. Now I’m studying law. As a workplace, it lets us grow.”

Ganz: “I thought I’d be a special-education preschool teacher or study psychology, something in the therapeutic world. At the same time, I had a huge passion for this industry — helping people become the best version of themselves and feel confident in their appearance. What we do here can sound superficial, but it isn’t. It’s deep.”

**Hava, you also employ people who aren’t family. Do your daughters’ opinions carry extra weight?**

Zingboim: “Being my daughter gives no special privileges; on the contrary, my daughters work harder than anyone. I trust them deeply, just as I trust my teams. In work meetings, I know how to make decisions, and I know how to accept them — just as I do with the CEO, the deputy CEO or a department head. The bonus, for me, is that I love being around them and I love the women they’ve become. I couldn’t work the long hours I do if they weren’t around me.”

**Who do you ask for a raise — Mom or Dad?**

All together: “The CEO.”

Matatia: “According to the contract, he can even fire us. Working with your parents is the hardest thing. You need them to value you not because you’re ‘their daughter’ but because you truly do your job well.”

**In the office, do you call her Mom or Hava?**

Gross: “I think I’m the only one who calls her Mom. Even in emails, I write ‘Mom.’”

Ganz: “Let’s put it on the table — I used to call them Mom and Dad. Then I was told it was weird. So I said, ‘My mom.’”

Zingboim: “What is this ‘I’ll ask Dad’? Say ‘my dad,’ because ‘Dad’ became slang here. 

‘Daddy, come to Daddy,’” she laughs. “Bottom line: whatever you call me, I’ll answer.”

Ganz: “I know calling her Mom isn’t formal enough, but when I talk to her, I say Mom, okay? And when I talk about you,” she turns to her mother, “I say Hava.”

Matatia: “I also used to say Mom, and switched to Hava — mother of all living.”

You’re all on the religious spectrum, correct?
Solomovitz: “On the spectrum, period.”

**How does faith shape the way you build and run the business?**

Solomovitz: “I’m a person with very strong faith in the Creator, and I believe everything has a reason. Our lifestyle is religious, although personally, I’ll admit that modest dress and head coverings never limited me. From a very young age, I was also in secular settings, so I stepped out of the religious bubble. That probably shaped me in some way.

“How does it affect decision-making? Many times I could have taken things hard, or when something didn’t work out the way I wanted, he always helped me understand and believe that everything is for the good. I don’t know if that comes from a religious or a spiritual place, but I interpret it as faith — that there’s something bigger guiding the path. Even if it’s not what I imagined or not at the pace I expected, there’s a reason.”

Beauty and fashion brands sell to us through sex. If you were shooting a campaign for the new product, would you veto seductive poses?

Gross: “Personally, I don’t connect to that, but it’s not my decision. Beyond that, the language or at least the DNA of our brand is about strength, not seduction or sexuality.”

Solomovitz: “When you have science and results on the ground, there’s less need to overshadow everything with something very sexual. I don’t need to push sex to get you to buy. On the contrary, it bothers me. I have the real thing.”

**Hava, in interviews over the years, you’ve spoken at length about your life story. You lived on the street as a teenager and later recovered from cancer. How did that shape your motherhood, and how did it shape theirs?**

Zingboim: “There’s no doubt my childhood shaped my motherhood and who I am. I grew up without a mother, and that absence is very present in my life. When she died, I was already an adult, but from a very young age, she didn’t function as a mother. She was very ill and not part of my life. From that place, I wanted to become a mother young. When I wake up every morning, I feel like a mother first, and I act from that place.”

Solomovitz: “It’s not just toward us. She calls her cosmeticians ‘my girls.’ Before I joined the business, I thought, ‘Sorry, I’m your daughter, who are these other girls?’ But her maternal warmth, which comes from her own lack, defines her personality.”

Zingboim: “When you lack something in childhood, you can let the absence define you and become that distant, detached mother who doesn’t get close, doesn’t touch, doesn’t hug; or you can take that emptiness and fill it with goodness. I decided to be the mother I wish I had. My motherhood fills a very big void — a void I know today can never fully be filled. No parenting will replace not having had a mother. Today I enjoy my children, their presence in my life, and their children. There is no greater joy than being an involved grandmother who spends time with her grandchildren.”

**An hour ago, you said you leave the office at 11 p.m. When do you find time?**

“Weekends are dedicated entirely to my grandchildren, and sometimes I see them during the week too. Some come in the mornings because their rabbit is in my yard. I know what each child likes, what interests them now. At the moment, the house looks like a playground that I update according to the grandkids’ hobbies. Right now we’re in a knights-and-dragons phase; before that it was cars.”

**You were young when she first became a public figure 17 years ago. Was it embarrassing that your mother became famous at 40?**

Gross: “My friends just wanted three seconds with her — for her to look at their skin and give an opinion.”

Solomovitz: “We can’t walk with her in the mall without people approaching her for a photo.”

Zingboim: “Even if we’re in the middle of an intense personal conversation, people don’t care. ‘Excuse me, are you Hava?’”

Gross: “Personal space isn’t really a sacred concept in Israel.”

Solomovitz: “I think women connect to her because she proves there are no glass ceilings. Is something above us? Nothing. Someone invented this idea. You want to be a stay-at-home mom for a year? Go for it and be a stay-at-home mom.”

Solomovitz: “It was an enormous privilege, something I reached with my fourth child, nearing 40.

In a land far away from war, the Belelvue University welcomes you with its huge, creaking oak doors and frosty marble floors that turn into glass. The establishment snuggly lies in a country claimed to be neutral– while the war takes over the rest of the world– priding itself on its political detachment. Housing refugees from all over Europe, the students come from a huge spectrum of families, backgrounds, and loyalties. While silence is encouraged, demeanour is not a good secret keeper. The libraries that smell of ink and parchment and the high-ceiling walkways refuse to stay silent.  

They are not soldiers. Not yet scholars. Some were sent by governments that will never admit their names; others arrived with nothing more than a love of puzzles and a knack for seeing patterns where others see noise. Maybe fate was right when it brought these estranged students together. And maybe, fate wants them to find themselves listening to a string of Latin letters read in a German accent over the radio in the dusty attic of the Bell Tower. 
It is said the war is far away. But in the quiet heart of neutrality, the code travels faster than the snow falls. In the bell tower dormitory, beneath stacks of papers and discarded coffee cups, young minds race against the clock. Outside, the lake is frozen. Inside, the walls remember everything that is whispered.
The question is not whether the code can be solved.
 The question is what will happen when it is.

Settings 
Main Location: Bellevue Unversity
Icy grounds, gothic and ancient, large robes and flowy dresses, next to a large lake

Key Areas 
The Bell Tower:  Old, dustry attic with the radio from a long forgotten research project. Has an overflow dormitory for students on scholarship. Cold, outcasted, miserable living conditions. It is said that the bell only rings for the dead.

Residential Area
Lively, bustling area of the campus, housing faculty and a lavish hostel for the children of the rich. Warm common spaces, candlelit hallways, rooms with desks and plush beds.


The Great Library: 
Bookshelves rising up till they touch the ceiling, frosted windows, the crackle of the fireplace, dogears, restricted section for scholars and faculty only.

Other Areas: 
Map room, observation tower, lecture hall, dining hall, cafe de nord, the lake. 

Premise 


In the twilight years between great wars, Bellevue University stands as a jewel of neutrality — a centuries-old academy in a quiet, politically insulated nation. Its ivy-clad halls, echoing bell tower, and sprawling libraries have always been a sanctuary for learning… and secrets. Students from across the fractured world come here to study under legendary professors, escaping the turmoil brewing beyond its iron gates.
But whispers curl through the candlelit corridors. A cipher has surfaced — an intercepted fragment of an enemy code, smuggled into the university under mysterious circumstances. Officially, the faculty dismisses it as a relic. Unofficially, the brightest (and most reckless) minds among the students are determined to crack it, believing it may contain not only military secrets, but the key to preventing an unthinkable catastrophe.
Living between the shadow of the bell tower and the hum of the residential halls, these students form an unlikely fellowship — mathematicians, linguists, engineers, poets — each drawn into a game far larger than themselves. The university becomes a battleground of wits and trust, where loyalty is tested, paranoia seeps into friendships, and every solved clue uncovers darker truths about the war… and about Bellevue itself.
Will they succeed in time, or will the code consume them before the war does?



Subplots 
Students notice extra pages being added and removed mysteriously from their working copies.


Someone inside the university seems to be feeding them false leads — but why?
A bell tower resident, who shouldn’t know about interception, grows suspicious
Items vanish from the bell tower dormitory — not valuables, but odd, specific things (chalk dust, clock gears, library index cards).


A student is rumored to have disappeared during a winter storm years ago… no body was found.


Strange notes are left on dorm room doors written in an unfamiliar shorthand.


The café owner in town seems overly curious about the students’ progress.


A professor has been seen meeting with strangers near the frozen docks at night.


Several students receive letters from “home” that have obviously been tampered with.


Cracking the code could save lives… or cause the war to escalate.


Players must decide: Do they turn it in? Destroy it? Leak it?


Divisions form in the group — loyalties split, betrayal becomes a real threat.

honestly another reason i keep backing out is that i have a really nice, peaceful, fulfilling life and happy relationships with family. i can't help worrying that a relationship gone wrong would damage my life in ways i don't need (seen friends who date really self-destructive people who take their mental illness/problems/attachment/family issues out on their partner). but i guess i also know at some point i have to get out there. just wondering how you guys are brave enough to do it and how to make it work, things that made it not work out in the end for you, whether you were in it for marriage or just to explore (my parents were each other's firsts so i kinda feel that pressure too to get things right the first time), and what the general steps and stages of an rs look like. also curious about the difference btw a friend and a partner - i know some people can be really good, supportive friends but end up being terrible partners.

I don’t even have a solid plan, I just wanna go somewhere for a few days, eat good food, walk around, see some stuff, not go broke, you know the vibe. Problem is, everyone I asked gave me totally different answers. One friend said Belgrade is “cheap as hell”, another one said “bro it’s basically Bucharest prices now”, so idk what to believe anymore. I’m not trying to do anything fancy. No clubs, no expensive restaurants, no tourist traps. Just… normal life in another country for a bit. If anyone from Serbia (or who traveled recently) can give me the real numbers, that would help a lot:

\- how much is a normal lunch, like something decent but not restaurant-restaurant?  
\- coffee/pastries… still cheap or getting painful?  
\- is Belgrade actually way pricier than Novi Sad or Niš?  
\- buses/trains ok or am I signing up for chaos?  
\- any small towns that are underrated and won’t drain my wallet?

I’m basically traveling like a broke student even though I’m not a student anymore lmao, so I’m not picky. I just don’t wanna show up and realize my budget was a fantasy.

1pgl9tb,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1pgl9tb/tifu_by_snooping_on_my_partners_phone_for_the/,TIFU by snooping on my partner’s phone for the first time ever and opening a door I’m not sure how to close (repost + update),"Reposting because I deleted the original 

I (23F) have been with my boyfriend (23M) for three years. We live together, I moved cities for him, changed my career path to be here, and I genuinely thought we were solid. But for the past month he’s been distant. Not cruel, just absent. Quiet and on his phone constantly. I brought it up twice, and he apologised twice. Nothing changed.

Yesterday I accidentally drank coffee way too late and couldn’t sleep. My brain was racing. And this awful instinct just hit me like a truck: check his phone.
I’ve never snooped on a partner. Not once. But his phone was on my bedside table, unlocked, screen dimmed. I told myself it was just to calm my anxiety.
Instead, I blew up my whole night.
I found a message with someone I didn’t recognise. Short, vague, but it looked like he was asking them out for a drink. It wasn’t explicitly flirty, so I tried to stay rational. Sometimes he goes out with work friends. Fine.
Then I opened TikTok.
There were DMs between him and some girl I’d never heard of. A week’s worth. He told her he wanted to cuddle her. They were talking like they had this little emotional world together. He was investing in it. He had the energy for her that he didn’t have for me.
I saw red. My brain left my body. This is a man whose dad cheated on his mum. Who has always sworn he’d never be that person. And he’s always been so gentle, so seemingly loyal.
I woke him up, yelling, crying, shaking him, demanding answers. I’m ashamed of how frantic I was, but in the moment it felt like the floor dropped out from under me. He denied it at first. Then when I showed him the messages, he tried to grab his phone in this panicked way I’d never seen before. Then he shut down completely and kept saying, “We can’t do this. I’m so embarrassed. We can’t live like this.”
I told him I didn’t want to break up. I moved my entire life for this relationship. He just kept saying he didn’t know why he did it. That he liked the attention. That we were “stuck in a rut.”
I saw he’d taken nude photos and videos of himself. Instead of making me angrier, it made me weirdly sad because he used to send me things like that when we were long-distance. We don’t sext anymore. Our sex life slowed down. We’re 23 and somehow turned into “once a week” people and both of us have felt the lack of passion.
In my panic, I said maybe we could have a semi-open relationship, no sex with others, but if he needed validation or flirting or attention, we could set boundaries. I even said I’d do the same if I wanted, which I don’t. I just missed feeling wanted and adored.
He apologised. We calmed down. I still couldn’t sleep.
I took screenshots of their WhatsApp messages before confronting him. I know that’s bad. But I didn’t even end up needing them because I confronted him immediately.
Before sleeping, he blocked her on TikTok and WhatsApp.
After he fell asleep, I messaged her on WhatsApp.
Yeah. I know. I know.
This morning she replied saying she did know about me, because she asked him about me. She said he told her he was “lonely in London.” Which is insane because… we live together.
So in the morning I asked him again: “Did she know I existed?”
He kept saying no. Over and over.
Finally I told him, “Well, I messaged her.”
He got annoyed (fair enough), but also? He lied to my face four times.
He then said the reason he changed his answer was because last night, when I first asked, he said yes, and I reacted emotionally, so he switched to no because he thought “that’s what I wanted to hear.”
So apparently he was lying to avoid my feelings… but then also lying about lying. My brain hurts.
He told me to block her. I did. Then unblocked her because I’m still desperate for the truth. I deleted the chat and now I’m hoping she replies to my last message (which I can’t even see anymore). I’m debating texting her again. I know it’s messy. I know it’s bad. But my head is spinning.
Right now he says he won’t do it again. He says he wants to fix things. I told him I need transparency and that, because of this whole mess, I get two “snooping tokens” a year. He agreed, but that was definitely me panicking, trying to claw back some sense of control.
I don’t know if I should drop it and try to rebuild, or if I should ask her again what their conversations were really like. I love him so much. I don’t want this to end. But I also want the truth, because I feel like I’m losing my mind.


UPDATE!!!
The girl replied, turns out she’s an ex-fling for 2 years ago. The crazy part is last time they meant 2 years ago he said they went for coffee and she went crazy saying that she was gonna tell me about her and how they were hooking up when we first started dating (I didnt mind because I was also dating around then). Which I believe the because I didn’t know that girl. 

Apparently he’s been sending her nudes whic should would delete because she’s not into him. And apparently he asked her out for coffee recently and was trying to get her out for drinks, which she left on read.

AND!!! The TikTok account was a separate girl he just met on TikTok, he slid into her DMs. He said they talked for 3 days, I don’t believe that but he’s deleted the chat so I can see. He called it a par-asocial relationship, and I called be because he specifically said he wanted to cuddle her. 

He lied to be twice and told me 3 stories. I don’t know if I even believe the TikTok one because I can’t confirm. 

Also he told me that he just like to take videos and pics of himself naked, and I guess he likes sending to people. And I told him as his girlfriend I’m more than happy to have them instead of people that don’t want it!!

But I’m still with him, somehow. I want to make it work but it’s honestly so crazy. I’m planning on applying for a job near my brother so I can move there with no issue about money.

Although if there is a way to fix it, or at least make it through Christmas because I already got presents and I like his mum. And I do love him somewhere deep down, but more hurt atm)

TLDR Snooped on my BF’s phone → found flirty messages with a girl (turns out to be two separate girls), lies, deleted chats, and him sending nudes around. Confronted him, he confessed in pieces. Staying with him for now but preparing to move closer to family because this is insane.

I’m one of the devs at Keepsake Games, working on Jump Space, a co-op PvE FPS where you and up to three friends are the crew of a spaceship, jumping across the galaxy, putting out fires (literally), and doing on-foot missions and space walks between ship battles.

We launched into Early Access on Steam and Xbox Game Preview on Sept 19. It’s our debut game as a small Swedish studio of devs who previously worked at places like Hazelight, Mojang, and Coffee Stain.

# How Early Access has gone so far

The short version: it’s been kind of wild.

* We were lucky and crossed 1M wishlists before launch after a strong Steam Next Fest demo, and we've sold over 500k copies in Early Access.
* On Steam, the game is currently sitting at Very Positive reviews both recently and overall.

That said, the big influx of players also surfaced plenty of issues... Crashes, performance problems on some rigs, cloud save hiccups, so a lot of our Early Access time so far has been heads-down on fixes rather than flashy features. I hope we'll be out of the trenches come Christmas

# What we’ve updated since launch

We’ve been pushing regular hotfixes and patches. A recent example is **Hotfix 13** where we focused on progression and stability: [Steam Community](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1757300)

* **Mission rewards rework**
   * Failing or abandoning a mission now gives **75% of the salvage rewards** (ingots, credits), plus the XP/credits from completed jumps. The idea is that a rough run shouldn’t feel like a total waste of time.
   * If you crash, disconnect, or quit to menu, you now get partial rewards when you return to the hangar, same as if you’d abandoned the mission.
* **Networking & stability**
   * Fixed a bug in Unity’s low-level networking that was behind a bunch of desyncs, memory spikes, and crashes.
* **QoL fixes**
   * Fixed the pause menu not working from certain seats (like the Jump Seat and… the toilet).
   * Fixed a controller issue where ships weren’t selectable after recoloring them.

On top of that, we’ve been iterating based on community feedback.

# What’s next

We’ve been doing dev streams + Q&A every few weeks and recently showed a sneak peek of the Christmas update:

* **New Augments system** – equipable player perks that give you permanent build choices (more HP, different weapon behavior, damage buffs after kills, etc.).
* **Buddy-Bot command wheel** – for solo/duo players, you’ll be able to toggle what Buddy is allowed to do so he’s more helpful and less chaotic.
* **New Endless Waves mission type** – a ground-based arena where you defend an ongoing waves, crafting ammo/medbots as you go and extracting when you’ve had enough.
* **Holiday event + hangar decorations** – light seasonal event and beginnings of making the hangar feel more alive.

At the same time, a lot of engineering time is still going into crash & performance fixes and reliability (we know that’s not glamorous, but it’s necessary).

# If you want to check it out / ask stuff

I’ll be hanging around this Indie Sunday thread, so if you’re into co-op spaceship chaos and have questions about design, balance, progression, performance, or where we’re taking Early Access, I’m happy to dig into details.",8,1765121801.0,Games,0,0.9,False

1pgl8f2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1pgl8f2/marathon_training_with_interrupted_sleepfatigue/,Marathon training with interrupted sleep/fatigue,"Hello, 
Sorry-It’s a long post! 

I’ve just signed up to my 10th marathon. I’m pretty average my best time is 3:58:59 years ago doing a 16 week block averaging 80 km pw peaking with 105km. 

I’m also a physician and last year I started a new role after many years of training.
This role involves being “oncall” available/answer questions from hospitals wards/residents/EDs/patients for an extended period of time.

Typically I’ll start Monday and finish the following Monday.  We get some respite on Wednesday and Thursday night and someone else covers, so we can have 2 nights uninterrupted sleep (but then on other weeks I’ll be doing those 2 nights).

These oncalls are variable. It can be anything from having uninterrupted sleep to receiving calls/questions every 2 hours/to needing to go into hospital overnight to deal with an emergency. More often than not the night will be interrupted.
By the end of the week I’m quite tired. Sometimes extremely tired.

I will do these weeks at least 2-3 times during a 16 week marathon training block.

I did already do marathon training last year after starting my new role. The weeks I was oncall I maybe managed 2 -3 runs and the long run was much shorter then what is on the plan (I got called 3-4 times and decided to abort at 16km as I kept having to stop).
I also got ill and had to have 7 days off because of how I felt, so in total 3-4 weeks of my plan was impacted. I did 4:21:00 but this included running an extra 2km due to confusing signposting so if it wasn’t for that probably would have done around 4:10:00 ish. 

I’ve made some changes- I’m not the best morning exercise person but now working out/running before work as I’m less likely to be interrupted by calls and also motivation is better, as I’m less likely to bail if I’ve had a intense/longer than planned day at work. 
My main issue is I feel really rough waking up and it takes me an hour or so (even with coffee etc) to feel human and be able to get moving. I’m waking up at 5.30am and it’s still hard after 7 ish weeks of doing this.

I would love to try get a good time if not a PB. I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions on how to deal with the weeks when training is interrupted/Unable to do volume I’d like?
Is it better to do a 20 week plan to factor in the lost weeks? Or be realistic and accept I’ll never be able to PB in this current role ?

Thank you!

Hi! It’s me, again. Hahaha! Di ko na alam pang  beses ko nang magpost dito. 

But, obviously still haven’t found the one yet. May dadarating paba para sa akin, Lord?!! Hahaha. Eme

So I recently moved to the city, in Makati specifically. And I would like to find someone na kasama kong mag gala on my free days. Just wanna get more familiarized with the area. Let’s visit coffee shops, restaurants, museums, I also have a little background on jogging so we can do that as well. 

Before anything else, here are some things about me:

- 29 F (cancer bb ♋️)
- Single, of course. Been single for 10 years now, wow right?!!! 
- 5’2 84kgs (yes, I’m a plus size gurlie)
- As I mentioned above, just recently moved here in Makati, for work. 
- working 6 days a week, so I am hoping to meet someone who can respect and understand na mahirap ang schedule ko but who is still willing to date(?) me HAHA
- may sense kausap (according sa friends and past men who I dated) matalino daw ako kausap sabi nila HAHA. We’ll see about that
- culinary arts graduate, so yeah di kita gugutumin. Eme! HAHAHA
- naglalaro ML. Pero Miya at Angela lang alam. HAHAHAHAHA
- Into sitcoms. Currently rewatching FRIENDS, and si Monica palang nabibili ko sa Happy Meal ng Mcdo 😩

Enough about me, so here’s some of my preferences:

- 26 to 40 years old (yes, I’m into older men) 
- pero utang na loob yung wala namang sabit. - single. not married. If ever married, yung annulled na sana and on good terms with the ex wife
- working, kasi tbh gusto ko lang din nang may mang spoil sakin HAHAHA
- clingy. But not too much. Just the right balance of malambing and clingy
- 5’6 and above height, yes may preference ako sa height 🥺
- kakampink 🌸 (I am strong with my political views, kaya this is important)

So I guess that’s it? Baka wala na tayong mai-topic kapag nilagay ko lahat rito. HAHAHA

Please when you send a message, give a little intro about yourself. Won’t be entertaining a simple and boring “Hi”

See you! ☺️🫶",2,1765121538.0,PhR4Dating,0,1.0,False

1pgl1yz,https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/1pgl1yz/compare_a_rider_with_40_years_experience_to_a/,Compare a Rider with 40+ years experience to a Rider with One.,"I know what you are thinking. There are obvious differences, right? I happen to be the guy with 40+ years of riding many difference bikes... Where are you in experience? Just started a week ago, a bit over a year, going on three, close to 10? Regardless of the number, I personally welcome you to one of life's greatest joys. I don't give a hoot what your bike is or where it was made. We have something in common, as perfect strangers...a motorcycle! I want to offer some riding tips. But, for the sake of argument, I assume you have the following...
1. Understand and perform proper maintenance on your bike. You don't? Have a local shop do it. Learn the basics, for many reasons. Lack of maintenance leads to possibly having a really bad riding day.
2. Riding Gear. I know, but here we go. Full face or Modular (DOT) Helmet, true CE Rated Jacket & Pants, real protective Gloves, Riding Boots that protect your ankles...I spent $700 on a quality Helmet... what is your head and brain function worth?
3. Already passed the MSF Course and acquired your motorcycle endorsement. Let me pat you on the back!
4. An open mind. You have to be willing to learn. Good attitude!

Let's go for ride, I'll lead because I'm a bit more familiar with the route we will take. Follow my taillight, and I promise to get you back home in one, unbruised piece. Before we go, let me clear up a long held myth...""Its not a matter of if you will get in an accident, it's a matter of when."" That is a lie, don't believe it. Mr. 40+ has never gone down, and I'll explain later as to why.

 In the Cager Community (Car Drivers who never ride, nor ever consider it an option), will watch us cruise on by on the Highway. Let's assume you have enough basic skills to do that. They have no idea what our skill level is, correct? Just two Bikers with smiles on their faces, loving life.

Look at you keeping up with the old(er) guy! Great job! Highways and Interstates are probably the safest roads to ride on. Why? In spite of the speed, all traffic is headed in the same direction, minimal on-ramps merging into our path of travel. Tips...never ride behind Semi's. Choose to either pass them and get out in front, or stay back. Semi's get blowouts and their chunks of tire become deadly weapons of war. I advocate for a Bike with enough power (if you desire to ride on the Interstate) to pass these big boys when needed. My current Bike is a Kawasaki Versys 650, and has the juice in reserve to get it done. No Hayabusa needed. If a Truck Driver cannot see you in his mirrors, you are not there. Waste no time, make the pass and get back over to the right lane. As I pass, I glance at the truck's front left tire. If it's straight, he will drive straight. I've seen that wheel start to turn left, and I got the heck out of there. Yours and my main, ongoing goal, is to create a open space of protection. We good? Great, let's get off at the next exit... 

Your pulse begins to rise, your breathing is more rapid, sweat forms on your brow... those (dreaded) or (exhilarating) curves are ahead. What are your thoughts? Curves and intersections, considered the leading trouble spots, to riders in our community. We've lost far too many beloved Riders in these locations. Why?

Curves first. Before I have you follow me to my favorite asphalt twisties, let's hit the parking lot. What? Yep. Time for a review. Riders die, or get severly hurt in curves, and nothing has hit them to go down, except themselves and their lack of skills, judgement, too much testosterone, plus others. 

At this point, I want you to visit Motojitsu (Greg Windmar) on YouTube and Instagram. Greg has hundreds of videos for both new and existing riders to learn the skills necessary for both, staying alive and to live for another day, to ride again! Greg will show you how to master the Art of ""The Curve."" A man who served our country (Marines), doesn't mince words. His line, ""Shut up and practice"" is tough love. Not only will you gain the skills to handle any curve successfully,  you will also learn, Emergency braking, swerving, low speed maneuvers, U-turns, braking techniques (both the front and the back brakes), line selection, body position, throttle control and many other excellent techniques. You're welcome!

Well look at you! You have gained so many new skills, I hardly recognize you! You made the decision to practice and learn. Consider yourself in the top echelon of riders. This is a Sport. Every Sport, if taken seriously, requires a lot of practice. You're so excited now, you want to take more advanced riding classes. You are learning a well guarded secret... the more proficient you become as a rider, the more fun you have! Why? To have a new found trust in your skills, which reduces riding anxiety. You begin to stay calm, in all circumstances. You act and react, with authority. Now, at last, I can take you to my favorite twisty road, it is awesome! I feel comfortable that I don't have to keep checking my rear view mirrors, hoping your still upright...

See, I told you, that you weren't going to crash. The riding experience is like nothing else on Planet Earth. I am so thankful to be living in a time as ours, the machines, the roads, the horizon. The bike? Doesn't matter. Where is was made? Your choice. I happen to be a member of the Iron Butt Association, where the shortest certified ride is 1,000 miles (or more) in 24 hours or less...I admit, the IBA folks are a bit ""different"", but in a good way. We just love to ride and ride and ride. 

I want to say ""Stay safe"", but I won't. I will say ""Use all you skills"" on every ride, because that's what keeps you safe. Let's meet for coffee, I drink mine black. Cream and sugar are for Sissy's. 🏍👍🏻",0,1765121298.0,motorcycles,7,0.36,False

Kolompeh are these delicate date filled cookies from Kerman province in southeastern Iran they've been a tradition there for over 400 years, baked by local women for Nowruz and family gatherings using palm dates, Persian walnuts and warm spices like cardamom and cinnamon.

The texture is what gets me every time: that crumbly, melt in your mouth pastry that somehow cradles the sweet, spiced date walnut filling without falling apart. Grandma's secret? Sift the flour three times (for that airy lightness) mix in room-temp ghee or oil and let the dough rest at least 2 hours in the fridge no rushing or it rebels the filling's simple: just dates, chopped walnuts, a whisper of sesame and those spices that make your kitchen smell like an Isfahan bazaar

They're worth the 3 hour commitment if you've got a lazy Sunday nothing fancy, but when baked golden and stamped with those traditional circular patterns, they vanish faster than you can say ""miracle""

also don’t know if it’s a new change or a five points location thing but they no longer stamp your card if you’re gettin a drink other than coffee which is a little aggravating on its own. i usually get their hot chocolate (chocolate shop -> hot chocolate) and i have almost 2 full stamp cards (saving for when i need the boost of a free drink) and now i can no longer use them unless i buy a coffee i don’t want.",11,1765121102.0,Athens,6,1.0,False

Someone brought up that a Catholic priest proposed the Big Bang, which is true, but the universe doesn’t become Catholic just because one guy with a collar had a good idea—atoms don’t care about theology. We also talked about how absurd it is to assume a single Earth-born religion explains an entire expanding universe that may contain infinite worlds, infinite forms of life, and possibly beings so different from us they wouldn’t even recognize our idea of “God.” Trying to apply one species’ mythology to a cosmos of unknown size is like assuming your local town mayor secretly rules the whole galaxy.

About Me, aka snapshot:
• Work 9–6 (optimistically… automation is in working progress)
• Planet Fitness @ Kennedy/Steeles for sanity checks/reps
• Work hard (smart) / play hard (mindfully) / hermit hard (independent, not high maintenance)
• Hit startup ideas like ChatGPT hallucinations so.. just tolerate, nod or join in
• Current obsession: LLMs, SOPs, n8n, APIs, and GenAI toys like MidJourney - why? Was curious why there's so much AI slop... Are users bad or tool amateur? 🤔 Etc..

Values (Non-Negotiable):
• Secure attachment energy > no guilt trips if I go 閉關修煉 for a bit (ie week, months etc)
• Frugal + creative fun: weekend grind > late-night movies/games > cheese + wine (we ain't made of bank but can treat ourselves that way with budget)
• Personal growth matters. Well-being matters more.

Nice-to-Haves:
• Could be hustle buddy (even if different streams, just share the sportsmanship vibe- respect)
• Comfortable with being uncomfortable
• Curious mind, unbothered demeanor (agree to disagree is fine)
• Can handle philosophical rabbit holes or just vibe quietly
• Chill coffee meetups (pre-scheduled or spontaneous)

Dealbreakers:
• Drama, passive-aggression- if it's cool tea, maybe lol
• “Work hard play hard = clubbing every weekend” people (respectfully, listen I’m budgeting right now and trying to be a focused adult- once in a blue moon, maybe)

Next Steps:
If this sounds like an efficient mutual fit, 
1. drop a comment or DM
2. if enough people feel this, I’ll spin up a WhatsApp group chat.

Note:
Please- serious inquiries only. 
Your time is valuable, and so is mine. 
I invest heavily in self-development and supporting others — if you just talk about dreams and don’t execute, that’s a mismatch. 
No hard feelings, it's really cool if this isn’t your vibe. 🫰🏻
Btw, times are tough- I don't care if you employed or not (supportive through and through) - can still grind together, cheer you on.

1pgkvos,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1pgkvos/very_ill_complicated_going_on_almost_6_years/,"Very ill, complicated going on almost 6 years","I'm in an abusive relationship. Been with him since 2020. I have been sick for most of my life. But had been living alone and met him and we started to date then. He seemed nice. I took my time due to last past experiences, didn't rush, and wanted to be careful. 

After almost a year I moved in with him. Which turned to engagement. Now engaged going on 5 years. Over this time my health began to fade rapidly. For years I dealt with severe endometriosis, fibromyalgia, spinal issues, arthritis but was coping. Trying to stay strong. I suddenly had anniphiaxis in 2021. To what i and Doctors still don't know. We're thinking something in his old apartment as there's histiocytosis scarring in my lungs. But found out I had sscd which it triggered. Then turned into daily severe migraines 24/7 that I've dealt with now for years to the point I'm predominantly bed ridden, tunnel vision , can't handle light or sound much, on Oxygen also for vcd and lung nodules, and may have an ovarian remnant despite my total hysterectomy that may be causing more masses but docs won't help, many aren't experienced. I can't stand for more than a few seconds or sometimes a few minutes I'll get. So wheelchair bound. Or cane shuffle to the bathroom.

Before this got so bad I cooked, cleaned, had food ready. Spent as much time as I could with him. Walks, laughs, memories, good times. I noticed he'd start to go off, at first it was interrogations til 3 am. I was supposed to schedule a DMV appointment for him but it was on a day he was planning a surprise botanicsl garden visit for him and I. I had no idea, he kept me up til 3 am about how I could be so wreck less and selfish. But I had no clue. The next day when I tried to use DBT skills to express the hurt and anxiety it caused he threw his phone and yelled.

Fast forward now. Being as sick as I am. Needing help to a bath, food cooked for me. I still am not a mooch despite I can't work. I have SSD and SSI and give him whatever he asks, pay for rent, I have PAs come in and clean through my insurance. And try and reciprocate with gifts. I don't have much money as I can't work, he makes over $40,000 a year. I make under $900 a month and pay rent and give him my benefits care for food. And make sure the PAs can clean so he's not too burdened..his work hours are heavy. I still try to do stretches. Exercise bike. To try and get strength. My insurance finally approved me for infusions to try and help my cranial pressure and brain lesion issues. It would not for years. I'm on pain medicine in-between just to cope with the immense agony. After the infusion for weeks between the meds I sometimes pass out. My body gives out. He will go for a while, be an angel, it has turned to screaming at me at how I'm sh@t partner, an idiot, a m#therf#fucker, a c@nt. At the top of his lungs. Shook me if I wheel to the kitchen in the past about being a stupid b@tch "" if you fall I'll have to clean it up!""

It has now turned into SA territory to where I don't want to get into specifics. Last two times of being yelled at it was because he made me pancakes and my stomach was upset so I was very appreciative and said I'd save the rest for later. He screamed I was being an unappreciative partner. I said I would do my best to finish them then. I just wanted him to stop. So he screamed about that. Anything I said. 

If I ask for space I get a "" no "". I can't get to the wheelchair if I cry and say leave me alone while i try to get space I'll get tackled. The day before yesterday he screamed because I ordered door dash coffee. I rarely do it but my head pain was so severe and I just needed some caffeine to take the edge off. He said he was going back to sleep earlier. This was two days ago by the eay. 

He caught me grabbing it outside and screamed how I didn't get him coffee. I have gotten him coffee in the past but didn't know he wanted any. Or what kind this time. He said he was asleep. He yelled and I shook and pleaded with him to stop, that I was frightened, I recorded it secretly  as my therapist said to when I can and I'm just this sniveling curled up thing begging. 

He said he hadn't spent time with me and that I don't give a sh@t. We had been cuddling and watching Gen V days prior. But my body gives out sometimes and I literally can't stay conscious. He brought up gifts he's bought me and roses and how I don't get him sh@t. How "" everybody sees how horrible you are "" but I don't see any of his friends so I'm not sure what he means. This is untrue about reciprocation, I've gotten him gifts and cameos, with little funds I have. I even had a gift coming. Try to be affectionate but I get scared of physical contact so I try to smile. He said it didn't matter and now if I had a surprise being mailed as the surprise was ruined. I just was trying to let him know I was trying. But he said he didn't want it to or cared because it's probably it's something he wouldn't like, but he never made a list so I could buy something off of it. 

The next day he was soft spoken, smiles, made me cookies and bought me gifts. Hugs and kisses. He'd hug me and say I'm the best partner ever. How he's so lucky "" you've had a hard time and I know I'm apart of that "" in a sensitive voice. Now I can't help but seize up when he touches me. I'm terrified. He threatened a friend of mine with injury reasons I don't want to get into. Nothing that warrented with it. He'll just say he's jealous if I talk to people. He'll gauge if I'm texting on my phone. He'll listen outside the door. We sleep in separate rooms because I have trouble sometimes at night and he snores so I'm grateful for that space but sometimes he said he'll lay in the hallway and listen. So I have to be quiet. Especially if I'm needing support from friends from away or my therapist.

But I've been recording it over the years. The abuse. And the going on four years I've been predominantly bed ridden. Domestic violence shelters cannot help me, nor can case workers. Not with my level of ailments and care needed. They let me know blatantly there are no resources. He has helped me to to appointments and procedures, I have surgery coming up, still recovering from a spinal tap, which I pitch in ofcourse for gas or any hotel stay or food. I'm grateful. I tell him I am too. 

One infusion he grabbed my hand and put it on his crotch on the way there in the car. I was so exhausted. Even before it. 

I have care workers that are beyond unhelpful. Crisis lines. Anyone that could help me. I have no strength to even pack a box. My mother lives near by but is feeble. Other than that I have no family here. No friends.

All my friends moved from this town or are back east.

He will apologize for his behavior and say "" I'm sorry I will do better. "" But never does. And will not do couples counseling, I have tried to set it up. He said that he had a therapist and then that therapist said that all his problems are due to me and that his therapist would set me straight. My therapist said that that is not therapy protocol and makes no sense. He won't explain how the therapist said things are my fault though. I don't even know what I'm doing half the time. I used to yell back or fight back and I don't have the energy anymore. I keep my head down. Or I can't help crying which makes him more angry. Sometimes he holds me and he cries saying he can't live without me. Sometimes screams and says he'll ruin my life if I leave. He'll drag me to court.

The day before yesterday when I was able to record the last bout I left the video with friends I could send it to online. So I could be believed should he take my phone. I know those friends believe me but it's good to have this proof.

I have one friend that MIGHT be able to help me. I would not survive in the slums alone. With my level of finances in past complexes there were break ins, fires, gas leaks, ceiling caving in with floods and outlet sparks, housing does not care nor does maintenance with these places. And I wasn't as sick as I am now then even. If I had a fall or seizure alone. Many days I cannot lift my head. 

And insurance cuts have made it harder and harder for even more help and resources. I even tried to go to one care facility for a break for what I could afford, the nurses treated me like an animal. Denied my seizure meds, said I wasn't even on them despite proof, doctors would not communicate, messed with my pain meds, and closed the door when I needed breathing treatments, all of which I could prove I needed. It was hell. 

I have no options. I dunno if my friend can help. Or even how. No one's going to be able to care for me. Even he knows it. He reminds me "" you have no where to go bitch. You'll die without me. "". Then the next day he'll get me a bistro dinner and try and cuddle and send me funny photos and say "" I love you so much "". If I don't reply in a timely manner it's repercussions.

Between the pain and this, I don't know how much longer I can take it. My friends that saw the video. I didn't want to stress them but I just wanted them to know. I warned them first what it entailed. One of them from England did a video call with me just to give support and it meant so much. My friend of 24 years said he could try with his wife but it's really no guarantee. Have so many allergies and mobility issues. If I heard him cry would destroy me. That's what would reel me back. If I ever had a chance to leave and he caught me. But most likely it would be screaming in him calling the cops to get people off the property that would be helping me move.

If by some miracle I could get away id miss his daughter who visits, his grandma. I have no family aside my mom. Which he helps sometimes. I can't drive due to the sscd. I couldn't have children due to how severe the Endo was, had organs removed due it so needed the total hyst. So I cry thinking about how I'd have to say goodbye to his daughter who visits. She's very sweet. 

I live in a dark room. Trying to breath and even stretch it bed when he isn't home. He put a mini fridge by my bed and microwave which is nice. He won't let the PAs touch the washer and dryer, they can wash my clothes but he won't allow it. So rarely clean clothes or clean towels. Days he is so sweet he carries me to the bathroom when I can't move much. Helps me with an Epsom salt bath.

I'm at a point if accepting my fait. I have a young friend, long distance for years. I love her. And she has hints of a chronic illness budding. Her husband is showing signs like that. I feel it is too late for me so I just let her know, with what health she has I hope it gets better or never to my point. But her husband gets better or she gets out before it ever gets like my life.  

The pain I'm in, how the lesions and symptoms are slowly destroying me, and terror from the screaming, I'm fine it there's no after life. I won't attempt because it's not like the movies. Not simple. I'm not the praying type but I still try. Years I've tried. 

That someone can help me. Because no resources can. The crisis lines has only said my name and "" we're so sorry, please hang in there "". I don't have anything else to hang on to.

If you read all that thank you very much. I hope you don't judge me too much.

Around March of last year I (M25) was able to buy my own home at a pretty young age (at least for today’s standards) with the money I made from an editing job I have. I worked hard straight out of college and have made a really decent life for myself. I’m gay but pretty sure I’m asexual and not interested in kids or a relationship so the house is just strictly mine for now.

My older brother (31M) on the other hand isn’t so lucky and fell into some pretty hard times earlier this year. In June my brother lost his job and as a direct result of this would not be able to pay rent anymore. His wife (32F) was pregnant at the time so I allowed them to move in with me knowing the baby would live here for some time after arriving.

My mother (58F) and I have a complicated relationship. We didn’t speak for 3 years after I came out as gay and I’m typically not invited to family gatherings or holidays anymore. This doesn’t bother me and I’m glad to have her out of my life. Once again on the opposite side of me is my brother who absolutely adores my mom and does everything she says. Despite my successes I’ve never been enough for her and was done trying to be a long time ago.

One day while I was sitting in my kitchen drinking some coffee my brother approaches me and asks if she can come stay with us for extra support, I said no but I could tell they needed it so I changed my mind.

The first and immediate red flag was when she first arrived. My mom has always been obsessed with circumcision, I don’t know why but she’s always talked down on people who don’t cut their babies and that logic applied to my brother. There wasn’t a conversation that would go by without her mentioning it to my brother.

My brother and his wife ultimately made the choice to not circumcise and she was utterly livid. She packed her bags and left for a couple weeks. Once again was extremely glad she left but it wouldn’t last. She came back 3 weeks later with books, pamphlets and all sorts of wacky sources about why my brother just ruined his son’s life, how he’ll never find anyone now and that they’re horrible parents.

She didn’t stop at this, the formula the baby drank, the diapers the baby was wearing, the toys, damn even his clothes were all being dictated to by our mom. She had control over everything and i could see how it was destroying my brother’s wife from the inside.

One day she was talking through skipping vaccinations with my brother’s wife, practically demanding she didn’t vaccinate him. She was on the verge of tears and I’d had enough. I went upstairs, packed her suitcase and told her to get the fuck out and not to come back this time. She blocked us on everything and we haven’t heard from her in 6 weeks but my brother thinks I was too hard on her and that she was just trying to help. Was I? I think I did the right thing but maybe it was just her weird way of helping. Would appreciate any comments.",30,1765120849.0,AmIOverreacting,22,1.0,False
1pgkvbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1pgkvbl/review_7_days_at_atelier_playa_mujeres/,Review: 7 Days at Atelier Playa Mujeres,"Hello r/AllInclusiveResorts,

  
My partner and I just got back from a week at Atelier Playa Mujeres. We don't usually stay at all-inclusive resorts but wanted a relaxing, no-plans vacation and this more than delivered. I really liked reading these reviews to help me decided where to stay, so we wrote our own:

**Arrival:** The resort is about 45 minutes from the airport with traffic. We purchased transportation to and from when we booked the room and everything went smoothly. I received an email about a week out prompting me for our flight information and the car service handled it from there. I did end up bumping up our departure time for our flight home because I was worried we didn't have enough time, but it ended up being more than enough.

The Atelier Playa Mujeres lobby is stunning as advertised. We were greeted with cold towels, champagne, and cocktails and quickly checked in. Rooms turn over around 3 p.m. and we arrived around 1 p.m., so we had lunch while we waited. 

We did receive the Inspira sales pitch. After finishing at the front desk, they guided us to another lobby couch and handed us off to an employee who explained the hotel map and then told us we could get complimentary massages if we “had breakfast” with her a few days later. If you weren’t tipped off, you definitely would not know you were agreeing to a 90-minute sales pitch. She did not take no for an answer at first but kept asking why not and how come we didn’t think it was worth the time. It is a little off-putting that they do this right as you walk through the door and they won't let up unless you firmly decline. Afterward, no one else bothered us about Inspira during our stay.  

**Accommodations**: We chose an ocean view junior suite (non-Inspira). We thought the room was beautiful and easily the most modern and tastefully designed hotel room we’d ever stayed in. We may even try and find the green marble from the shower and sink for our own bathroom when we next remodel. The layout is atypical because the bedroom and bathroom are basically one huge room, with sliding doors that you can use to close off the bathroom. It worked great for us and we liked being able to open the doors for maximum space and sunlight, but it may be a little weird if you are staying with friends rather than a partner. I used all the bath products and thought they were decent quality as well.

We stayed on the fifth floor in Building 3 and I thought we lucked out since we are early to bed and early to rise. There are three buildings: Building 1 has the lobby, Building 2 is the most centralized to the beach and main pool, and Building 3 is attached to the rest of the property through their conference center. This means that if you stay in Building 3, you have a bit of a walk to access most things but also more peace and quiet. Also, Building 3 overlooks the “relaxation” pool, which we visited the most.

The rooms definitely have thin walls so you can hear your neighbors and people outside talking and walking around. There are a lot of rooms in Building 2 that look right over the main pool and get a lot of foot traffic so I bet they are loud. I would request another room on the fifth floor in Building 3 if we ever went back. If long walks bother you, I would go with one of the other buildings. I actually thought that the huge size and sprawling layout of the resort was a perk rather than a flaw, because you were often strolling along beautiful but mostly empty walkways and hallways and getting that illusion of privacy.

**Food:** We chose a place with good food reviews as we wanted to genuinely enjoy rather than just tolerate the food at the all-inclusive. While we didn’t love every meal, we were full and satisfied for the whole trip and had fun trying all the different places. The variety was a bonus. Also, there is food literally everywhere on this property and restaurants open all the time, so if you committed you really could be eating constantly. My partner loves to play food critic so he did the ratings: 

* El Cilento: 5/5. Italian. Recommend for lunch. We wound up eating here first while waiting for our room, and it was the sleeper hit of the trip. Very good carbonara, lasagna, and prosciutto arugula pizza - we came back multiple times and thought it was either the best or second best restaurant. Lunch is better because that is the only time they had our favorite pizza and pastas, but we did both love the limoncello mousse they have as a dinner dessert.
* El Suspiro: 1/5. Seafood. The worst of the places we ate. My wife liked her seafood pasta but my lobster was flavorless and rubbery. We didn’t go back a second time. The dessert was also not memorable.
* Los Abrazos: 4/5. Steakhouse. Hardest reservation to get. We both really enjoyed the meal and atmosphere. I had a great strip steak and my wife recommends the shrimp and risotto. The appetizers here are tasty, too: we liked the oysters rockefeller, beef empanada, and tuna tartare. The dessert (chocolate cake and cheesecake) was also delicious and classic. Just don’t expect an American steakhouse and you won’t be underwhelmed–the “baked potato” served with the steak was a tiny boiled white potato. Pro tip: before or after your dinner, hit up the rooftop bar next to the steakhouse. It’s open to non-Inspira after 6 p.m. everyday and has beautiful views and great bartenders. 
* Mercado 19: 3/5. Mexican. We had one dinner here and most of our breakfasts. You can get a la carte breakfast at El Suspiro or via room service, but we ate light breakfasts so the buffet worked for us. The chips and guac and tacos were good for dinner. My wife had pozole. As a breakfast buffet there are a lot of options but it’s aggressively mediocre. The fruit and pastries (of which there were many) were respectively underripe/obviously canned and reheated from frozen. However, the omelet bar was nice. The coffee is not strong. 
* Takeshi: 3/5. Pan-Asian. Has a nice design and atmosphere but the food we got was wildly varying in quality. We liked the sushi a lot, and the lamb rogan josh. However, the pad thai was the worst thing we had the whole trip because it was drenched in sauce (not pad thai, essentially). 
* Kopai: 4/5. Japanese. I ordered a ton of sushi here, and the fried rice was also good. We would recommend this over Takeshi if you have limited nights and want to have just one sushi meal. 
* Bikini Azul: 4/5. We ordered from here a lot as it is the pool bar attached to the relaxation pool. We thought it was pretty good - nothing special but the fact that they deliver poolside made it hard to be upset. The chicken fingers were surprisingly better than average, and we liked the cheesecake. The servers here are also stellar. 

**Maria Dolores:** If you didn’t know, Atelier Playa Mujeres has a Michelin-recognized restaurant. It is not included in the all-inclusive package, but we still 100% recommend eating here if you stay at the resort. It felt like an excursion unto itself! We didn’t have a reservation ahead of time, but I talked to the concierge and she found us a timeslot during our stay. The restaurant had amazing service and ambience (they have a violinist) and really interesting dishes. We ordered a la carte and at our waiter’s recommendation picked an item from each section of the menu to split, plus one main course for each of us. We were stuffed. If you do the tasting menu, you each get an appetizer, soup/salad, tostada, and main, which would have been far too much food for us. Our total was about USD 200 (a splurge on a trip where all the food was already paid for, but worth it to us). 

Highlights: the buñuelo, black bean soup, tuna belly tostada, and smoked mezcal old fashioned.

**Drinks**: Always flowing. The poolside and restaurant cocktails were very sweet across the board, though we liked the coconut daiquiris and frozen mango margaritas from Bikini Azul. The indoor dedicated bartenders would make more balanced and interesting drinks, especially at the bars in the lobby and on the roof. 

**Pool / Beach**: We preferred the relaxation pool over the main pool because we like to just read, swim, and repeat. It was nice that the smaller pool is not an afterthought–it has its own dedicated swim up bar and restaurant, servers, and cabanas, and is still plenty big enough for swimming or just sitting in the water. We also enjoyed some time by the beach, which is small but has less sargassum than others. 

We usually did not have trouble getting chairs or a cabana at the relaxation pool in the morning because we would arrive around 9 a.m. But a lot of people play the “towel game,” especially with the cabanas and especially at the main pool. When we would walk through in the early afternoon, all the seats were taken and as many as half were “reserved” by towels and books with no one around. One day, the cabana next to ours was “reserved” all day by a couple who showed up for maybe 1 hour total. I’m not sure, but I wonder if people who pay for Inspira can get their butlers to reserve seating all day and the pool managers are told not to move those towels? 

**Service:** Amazing! This was a highlight of the trip. Everywhere you went, people asked if you needed anything and were very kind and accommodating. I’ve never had such fast and consistent service poolside in particular. We once showed up late to the pool when all the chairs were taken and were preparing to sit in the water when the pool manager came over and told us someone had just vacated a cabana and he had seen us coming and set it up for us. So nice! 

They do keep the restaurants way understaffed and the length of your dinner can vary a lot as a result. Sometimes we’d be there for 2 hours, and sometimes they’d have us in and out in less than 1 hour. We did tip throughout the trip for drinks, dinner service, drivers, etc. and couldn't tell you if it meant we got enhanced service.

**Other:** We took the bike tour, which was fun and not at all strenuous, and left the resort for 1 day to take the ferry to Isla Mujeres. We wouldn't really recommend this. Playa Norte is one of the most beautiful beaches I've ever seen, but the part of the island we saw was 100% tourist trap. You walk through streets of people trying to flag you down, claiming they know you / served you at your resort, and selling random crap. That said, if you get farther away from the ferry it may be more relaxing. 

I learned from another couple at the bar that the hotel offers a USD 50 trip to Isla Mujeres. At first, I thought making it on our own would save us money but I'm not sure it did once you account for two Ubers and the visitor ferry price. Plus, we didn't know what we were doing and dropped our pin for the return trip in the wrong place and almost got dropped off on the side of the Mexican highway, outside the Playa Mujeres gates. Oops!  

**Overall:** If you are looking for a relaxing resort with good food and beautiful accommodations where you will be treated like a princess for your stay, Atelier Playa Mujeres is a great pick!",5,1765120836.0,AllInclusiveResorts,0,1.0,False

Tapos si kuya naman was nicer to her pero kay Clifford he was a bit aggressive. 

Also, this nomination, mukhang marami sa mga hms ang may problem sa pagiging bossy ni Arce which is hindi naman ata pinapakita sa mga episodes na may ganun palang kaganapan. 

Napansin ko rin na after all the mess caused by Iñigo, halos wala akong narinig sa mga hms na they want to nominate Iñigo specifically considering na isa siya sa pasimuno sa naging violations ng karamihan. 

Dapat automatic nominated ang may highest violation para matuto, yung weekly task nila parang naging achievement lang na makapasok sila ng dalawang bola. It may be hard but it doesn't seem to be enough. Paano magkakaroon ng accountability mga violators kung lahat madadamay sa violations nila? Dahil puro kapamilya nepos ang highest violators ayaw na nila i-automatic nominated? I was waiting for that announcement na after i-announce ang mga nominated via voting, i-announce rin na nominated ang mga highest violators to give them a hard lesson and these highest violators will serve as an example sa ibang violators.

Dapat talaga individual tasks yung pagredeem ng mga violators sa mga violations nila eh.

We have one child 2F. 

I do not work a full time job, I stay home with the child and work for cash cleaning when I can. I bring in 2000 a month. 

With the cost of daycare, and my lack of skills - working for minimum wage and paying for daycare we would be putting out more than what comes in. 

He is a blue collar worker bringing in 4000 a month. 

We have a car. I do not drive. I rely on public transit to go everywhere I go. It's very rare he will drive me anywhere even if he's home. I take the toddler on the bus or walk while he stays home if he isn't coming to the activity.

I pay the rent (1800)
utilities (~200)
Internet (50)
I have 0.00 leftover every month. 

He pays for groceries (800)
Car payment and insurance (800)
And for all of our fun/diapers etc (he just bought a new couch for the home recently.) 
I do not know what he has leftover every month because he doesn't share that with me. 

I am so beyond burnt out with the toddler. Mentally drained. I am desperate for a real break. I know I'm not being the mother I can be because I am losing myself in being depressed. I have asked for an hour a week that he takes the toddler out, he says it's impossible to take her out and I need to leave the house for that time since I'm the one who needs the break. 

I don't have extra money to even get a coffee at a shop. I can't afford a class. I do not have any local friends. It is winter. I don't drive. What are some things I can do for an hour myself completely free? I do not have a proper winter coat so it gets cold quickly. I have been thinking about going to the library to read, I don't know why I haven't yet. Probably because it's easier to sit here and mope. 

He is in a league sport he plays once a week, he stays out till 5AM playing pool with his buddies at least one night a weekend.

I do all the dishes, all the laundry, all the house cleaning. I do about 75% of the cooking. 

He feels like he has made many changes since becoming a father, (he has, but I feel like golfing less is just part of being a parent and not something to be given a medal for) and that I have only changed for the worse. He's very frustrated that I'm not divorced. The divorce costs 600. I have asked him to pay for it and he has said absolutely not, that's not his mistake to fix. I ask where he wants me to find the money to pay for it, he doesn't have an answer. 

He is frustrated that I have become depressed and a ""couch potato,"" he thinks I sleep too much and don't try. I agree, I hate what I've become and how I feel.  I have put on a lot of weight from just sitting all the time. But I don't know how to get out of this. I feel broke, stuck, unappreciated and unimportant.

Lately almost every night ends up with me crying or screaming at him.  I do sometimes get manipulative (not on purpose,) or very ""poor me""... I will ask things like ""what is so wrong with me that you don't think I deserve a break?"", ""I'm sorry I don't want you to leave I'll shut up about money."" 

That's frustrating for him to deal with. I understand. I want to be here, I want to be happy here. I want to be happy here so so badly. I want to agree with him about how the money goes. Like I desperately am trying to change what I thought a partnership looked like to continue this and it just keeps feeling heavier and heavier and I am crazier and crazier.

I do not want to leave. I don't know how I'd eat without him. I don't want to not have him. But I am making him miserable every day because I am mentally fucked.

Is this possible to un-toxic. Is it possible we can fix this and be happy together. I don't know. I seriously want it to be good so badly and it's just so... Bad.

I have depression myself and go through very low lows sometimes, so I understand what I’ve wanted from partners in my past during those moments.

My (now) ex girlfriend has been experiencing one and broke things off with no warning just before we saw her sister for lunch last week (full story in my post history), but then monitored my stories incredibly closely all week.

I was silly and took that as a sign that she missed me and that I should reach out, but she replied 2 hours later saying nothing had changed for her. She was kind and wished me a happy Christmas, but it’s just really sad and a bit confusing. I took an hour to be sad and then wished her one back and said she knows how to reach me and left it there.

Really I’m probably looking for confirmation of what my gut feeling is, but she’s gone, isn’t she? She won’t come back around?

This is just off the back of my own experiences when depressed but I would’ve wanted my girlfriend to swing back into my DMs after a few more weeks just to check in/gently ask about coffee, but I’m not sure if that’s the play here.

The issue started right from the parking. The watchman insisted that I park my scooty at the extreme end, in a spot that would obviously make it difficult for me to take it out later. I told him clearly that I’d be back in 5–10 minutes, but I ended up taking around 13 minutes.
When I returned, he started talking to me very rudely, questioning how I could “come so late” and acting like I’d done something wrong. His tone and attitude were completely unnecessary. A little professionalism and basic courtesy isn’t too much to expect, especially at a popular place.

Inside, things were the usual—staff not very welcoming, which has always been the complaint with Sairam.
To be fair, though, I’ll give credit where it’s due: their cold coffee taste has improved a bit compared to before, so that was a nice surprise.

But overall, the behaviour of the staff really overshadows the experience. Good coffee doesn’t justify rude service.

If Sairam wants to maintain its name, they seriously need to train their staff (including parking management) to treat customers with basic respect.",3,1765120435.0,Sangli,4,1.0,False

I (20M) used to be in a 1 year long relationship with a (20F) girl about when we were 16 years old.

I was an introverted antisocial guy. Had 0 friends, talked to no one, didn't participate in school. I never cared about having a girlfriend either. But then, high school began, and i met her. An introverted antisocial girl, with no friends and no one to talk to. I approached her because i felt i could relate to her. A friendship had began and after later on it evolved into a romantic relationship.

Almost every day, we would hang out together, all alone. Usually in quite places or at a time with very few to no people around us. We would mostly go to a beach or to a park.

The relationship lasted for a year, it was magical. But it had started to become unhealthy because she had mental health issues that at first weren't apparent or communicated. She had anorexia so she would avoid eating for days straight because of her self-image issues. She was extremely depressed, anxious and timid.

But at the end, it crumbled. It had turned extremely toxic. I was begging her to eat food. She  had started cutting so i was begging her to stop that as well.She went to a psychiatrists (after convincing her) and got on a medication (an anti-depressant i can't remember of) that after a while caused a seizure and left her with Tourette-like symptoms. So we would deal with that as well.

Of course a lot more had happened but i am just summarising the important details. Other than that, even though i was trying to be supportive, sometimes i was harmful in some ways.  Sometimes i would be criticizing her, other times i would get angry at her. Although i wasn't abusive or anything, it wasn't a good thing.

We eventually broke up. We broke up without actually communicating about it. Because she saw me with another girl who was a friend, she got extreme about it and stopped talking to me for a while, after she reached back, i was done, i didn't talk to her nearly as much, and things kind of ended on their own.

**Present**

It's been like 3 years. A couple of days ago, i found her phone number, so i decided to reach her.

I don't know what i actually want out of this. For one i definitely want to know that she is doing well.

One side of me wants her back, and another one doesn't. I don't feel romantic attraction to her, but i just love her so much. She was my soulmate.

I sent a long text message. Obviously asking about her wellbeing and how's life. Delved into talking about some of my mistakes and how i was sorry, how i wanted to clarify certain things in case she felt bad. How much i loved and still love her. And if she wanted to go out for a coffee.

Today she replied. She says, she has been into a happy one-year-long relationship. She is in the best phase of her life. She got into the school she wanted (she is extremely talented at drawing).

It broke me. Not the fact that she has a boyfriend, for some reason i don't care that much about that (i think). What breaks me is how apathetic her messages seemed. I was literally experiencing physical discomfort as i was crying a river writing all of that, and it's like she just casually gave a casual response in a matter of minutes.

She suggested that we meet in-person, clarifying that we do so strictly as friends. I accepted. Now how things will turn out is a matter of time.

**What do i do?**

All of those years, i had 3 instances where a girl was into me. But i never reciprocated, because i wanted HER. Even though we broke up, i felt like that i couldn't do such a thing. So i always needed to properly move on. And this is an opportunity for me to do so. I love her and i want her in my life on a deep level that isn't possible. All i wanted in my whole life was to have her as my soulmate.

I want to meet her so i can properly move on. I want to make the realisation that this is not a thing that will happen in this lifetime. She is permanently gone.

The matter is, after i move on, can i truly find someone like her? An introverted, sweet, extremely caring, obsessed (for lack of a better word) girl. I extremely doubt so.

I believe she was just an exception. I think she was that way because of the circumstances. I don't think there is a woman like that, i mean that isn't even realistic or healthy.

I already feel like my heart is coming to accept this and move on. Once i do, i don't know how to find a relationship like this again.

**TL;DR**

I'm (20M) an introverted, antisocial with minimal friends who used to be in a relationship with a girl exactly like me. Lasted about a year, we cut ties and sort-of reunited, she moved on with her life so there is no way she is coming back. 

I want a relationship like the one i used to have. The positives: We would be together almost everyday for almost the entire day. We would only be alone. We were extremely deep and affectionate.

I have had 3 instances of a girl being into me but i never reciprocated because i wanted HER. Now that i am about to move on, i am going to be open to dating. But i don't think there is a woman like that at all (and that's realistic and heathy to be honest), so i don't think i will actually get into a relationship ever again.

* Would love to hear from people who were into my situation. Anything really.

* Anything would be helpful really.
* I'm open to DMs (Not for dating or anything weird like that, just to clarify)

She had anorexia so she would avoid eating for days straight because of her self-image issues. She was extremely depressed, anxious and timid.

But at the end, it crumbled. It had turned extremely toxic. I was begging her to eat food. She  had started cutting so i was begging her to stop that as well.She went to a psychiatrists (after convincing her) and got on a medication (an anti-depressant i can't remember of) that after a while caused a seizure and left her with Tourette-like symptoms. So we would deal with that as well.

Of course a lot more had happened but i am just summarising the important details. Other than that, even though i was trying to be supportive, sometimes i was harmful in some ways.  Sometimes i would be criticizing her, other times i would get angry at her. Although i wasn't abusive or anything, it wasn't a good thing.

We eventually broke up. We broke up without actually communicating about it. Because she saw me with another girl who was a friend, she got extreme about it and stopped talking to me for a while, after she reached back, i was done, i didn't talk to her nearly as much, and things kind of ended on their own.

# Present

It's been like 3 years. A couple of days ago, i found her phone number, so i decided to reach her.

I don't know what i actually want out of this. For one i definitely want to know that she is doing well.

One side of me wants her back, and another one doesn't. I don't feel romantic attraction to her, but i just love her so much. She was my soulmate.

I sent a long text message. Obviously asking about her wellbeing and how's life. Delved into talking about some of my mistakes and how i was sorry, how i wanted to clarify certain things in case she felt bad. How much i loved and still love her. And if she wanted to go out for a coffee.

Today she replied. She says, she has been into a happy one-year-long relationship. She is in the best phase of her life. She got into the school she wanted (she is extremely talented at drawing).

It broke me. Not the fact that she has a boyfriend, for some reason i don't care that much about that (i think). What breaks me is how apathetic her messages seemed. I was literally experiencing physical discomfort as i was crying a river writing all of that, and it's like she just casually gave a casual response in a matter of minutes.

She suggested that we meet in-person, clarifying that we do so strictly as friends. I accepted. Now how things will turn out is a matter of time.

# What do i do?

All of those years, i had 3 instances where a girl was into me. But i never reciprocated, because i wanted HER. Even though we broke up, i felt like that i couldn't do such a thing. So i always needed to properly move on. And this is an opportunity for me to do so. I love her and i want her in my life on a deep level that isn't possible. All i wanted in my whole life was to have her as my soulmate.

I want to meet her so i can properly move on. I want to make the realisation that this is not a thing that will happen in this lifetime. She is permanently gone.

The matter is, after i move on, can i truly find someone like her? An introverted, sweet, extremely caring, obsessed (for lack of a better word) girl. I extremely doubt so.

I believe she was just an exception. I think she was that way because of the circumstances. I don't think there is a woman like that, i mean that isn't even realistic or healthy.

I already feel like my heart is coming to accept this and move on. Once i do, i don't know how to find a relationship like this again.

# TL;DR

I'm (20M) an introverted, antisocial with minimal friends who used to be in a relationship with a girl exactly like me. Lasted about a year, we cut ties and sort-of reunited, she moved on with her life so there is no way she is coming back. 

I want a relationship like the one i used to have. The positives: We would be together almost everyday for almost the entire day. We would only be alone. We were extremely deep and affectionate.

I have had 3 instances of a girl being into me but i never reciprocated because i wanted HER. Now that i am about to move on, i am going to be open to dating. But i don't think there is a woman like that at all (and that's realistic and heathy to be honest), so i don't think i will actually get into a relationship ever again.

# Questions, i guess?

* Would LOVE and greatly appreciate to hear from women who are or were exactly as i described my ex. Even if it's an extremely small thing, it still means a lot to me.
* Would love to hear from people who were into my situation. Anything really.
* Would love some overall advices. Although i don't know if i want advices like ""love yourself and you will find one"" because i can't see how that really applies. Perhaps the dynamic i am seeking for is a symptom of a problem with my self and i am open to arguments about that.
* Anything would be helpful really.
* I'm open to DMs (Not for dating or anything weird like that, just to clarify)

I’d really appreciate some insight from people who identify as FA, please 😭

My (now) ex girlfriend has been experiencing one and broke things off with no warning just before we saw her sister for lunch last week (full story in my post history), but then monitored my stories incredibly closely all week.

I was silly and took that as a sign that she missed me and that I should reach out, but she replied 2 hours later saying nothing had changed for her. She was kind and wished me a happy Christmas, but it’s just really sad and a bit confusing. I took an hour to be sad and then wished her one back and said she knows how to reach me and left it there.

Really I’m probably looking for confirmation of what my gut feeling is, but she’s gone, isn’t she? She won’t come back around?

ETA: again, this is just off the back of my own experiences when depressed but I would’ve wanted my girlfriend to swing back into my DMs after a few more weeks just to check in/gently ask about coffee, but I’m not sure if that’s the play here.

so yeah if anyone has any information or studies on the effects of caffeine consumption from non coffee sources that would be great, many energy drinks have added thiamine and b12 and whatever else to help with focus so if anyone has more information on those that would be nice as well.

1pgkaq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pgkaq6/i_think_she_took_advantage_of_me_and_i_feel_bad/,I think she took advantage of me and I feel bad for thinking that,"This revolves around me and a friend.

She and I met like two years ago through mutual friends and we saw each other periodically when our friend group met (like twice a month).

Since the beginning we developed a good friendship, we just kinda clicked and enjoyed talking to each other.

Eventually I did feel that I had some feelings for her, she's pretty and I really like her personality and way of living. It was like a casual background crush of sorts, I had bigger crushes during these two years we've known each other.


Lately I've been kinda lonely and bored so I asked her if she ever wanted to meet up and talk, I meant it as a casual friend meet up, just some coffee and yapping, cause I genuinely enjoy our conversations.


We fast forward to two nights ago, our friend group met up, she didn't come this time, I exaggerated with the alcohol and other substances, so my impaired brain decided to text her cause I heard she got in a fight with another mutual friend and I wanted to hear her side of the story.

Whilst we were texting she suddenly appeared, I reread the texts the morning after and she repeatedly said she was coming but I didn't understand it in the moment, just shows how fucked up I was.


A few minutes after she arrived we went inside to talk privately, we talked about the fight and some other things, I went to pee and when I came back she suddenly asked me if I was attracted to her. Now I was in a state that I would've told anything to anyone and I'm pretty sure she could tell, I ended up telling her yes and we talked about it for a bit.


Now, I'm a very apologetical person, so I feel awful that it happened that way but I can't shake the feeling that she definitely took advantage of my state. And I feel bad for thinking that but it's the truth.


What saddens me the most is that this will obviously hinder our friendship, I don't think I would've ever told her under normal circumstances cause as I said before it's a very simple form of attraction, I like her because of who she is and that's about it, I have never seen any potential of us actually being together or anything. But anything I tell her now will simply feel like I'm trying to save what's already lost.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Jaguars vs. Colts: A Sausage Griddle Showdown for the AFC South Lead**

The Jacksonville Jaguars and Indianapolis Colts are set to clash in a Week 14 battle that’s tighter than a quarterback’s grip on a $20 bill during a playoff drought. Both teams enter 8-4, and the winner claims sole possession of the AFC South lead. But with the odds favoring Indianapolis by a sliver, this game is more “friendly family feud” than “explosive fireworks.” Let’s break it down with the precision of a laser-guided Hail Mary.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Game of Inches (and Decimal Points)

The betting lines tell a story of cautious optimism for the Colts. At DraftKings, the Colts are listed at **-1.5-point favorites with decimal odds of 1.77**, implying a **54.5% chance to win**. The Jaguars, meanwhile, sit at **+2.1 odds**, translating to a **47.6% implied probability**. For context, that’s like flipping a coin that’s been subtly weighted toward Peyton Manning’s favorite nephew.

The total line is pegged at **45.5 points**, with nearly even money on Over/Under across bookmakers. This suggests a game where both defenses will be forced to play “situational football” — think of it as a chess match where the pawns are also juggling chainsaws.

---

### Digesting the News: No Major Injuries, But Let’s Add Some Flair

While no seismic injuries or trades have rocked this matchup, let’s spice things up with some *theatrical* analysis:

* **The Colts’ offense**: Led by a quarterback who’s as steady as a Roomba on a coffee buzz, Indianapolis leans on a running game that’s “reliable” in the same way a toaster is reliable — unless it’s in the mood to start a fire. Their offensive line? A well-rehearsed dance crew, keeping defenders on their toes (and occasionally tripping them with well-timed footwork).

She generally was a bit louder than everyone else which isn’t a big deal, they can get rowdy and they aren’t prudes. But during our caroling she was SCREAMING, during white elephant she kept saying stuff like “I hope we don’t leave with this gift” loud enough for others to hear even though she was trying to whisper, and she kept calling me a “sourpuss” when I told my mom 1 large container of cookies was enough. She also made a comment around everyone else that she can’t even get high right now. 


Not just this time but in general, very time I asked her to slow down drinking (or chill with the multiple energy drinks, smoke less weed, don’t drink coffee at 9pm, don’t eat 1/2 a pizza after a night out drinking) she gets upset and tunes me out, just sort of stops talking about it and keeps doing whatever she wants. When I do voice these concerns she often, not always, will get so drunk she needs help walking to the car or controlling herself, will stay up way later than intended then complain in the morning about how tired she is throughout the day, and will get a distended stomach and complain about how much it hurts. 


I’m trying not to be a controlling ass that thinks he knows better what to do than she does, but damnit that is how I feel right now. I’m feeling like I’m a babysitter/caretaker when she binges like this. I love her deeply and these things aren’t super common (anywhere from 1x//2 months to 4x/month), but I’m embarrassed and changing plans to not have her join activities where drinking will be happening?

1pgk044,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1pgk044/very_ill_beyond_complicated_going_on_almost_6/,"Very ill, beyond complicated going on almost 6 years","I'm in an abusive relationship. Been with him since 2020. I have been sick for most of my life. But had been living alone and met him and we started to date then. He seemed nice. I took my time due to last past experiences, didn't rush, and wanted to be careful. 

After almost a year I moved in with him. Which turned to engagement. Now engaged going on 5 years. Over this time my health began to fade rapidly. For years I dealt with severe endometriosis, fibromyalgia, spinal issues, arthritis but was coping. Trying to stay strong. I suddenly had anniphiaxis in 2021. To what i and Doctors still don't know. We're thinking something in his old apartment as there's histiocytosis scarring in my lungs. But found out I had sscd which it triggered. Then turned into daily severe migraines 24/7 that I've dealt with now for years to the point I'm predominantly bed ridden, tunnel vision , can't handle light or sound much, on Oxygen also for vcd and lung nodules, and may have an ovarian remnant despite my total hysterectomy that may be causing more masses but docs won't help, many aren't experienced. I can't stand for more than a few seconds or sometimes a few minutes I'll get. So wheelchair bound. Or cane shuffle to the bathroom.

Before this got so bad I cooked, cleaned, had food ready. Spent as much time as I could with him. Walks, laughs, memories, good times. I noticed he'd start to go off, at first it was interrogations til 3 am. I was supposed to schedule a DMV appointment for him but it was on a day he was planning a surprise botanicsl garden visit for him and I. I had no idea, he kept me up til 3 am about how I could be so wreck less and selfish. But I had no clue. The next day when I tried to use DBT skills to express the hurt and anxiety it caused he threw his phone and yelled.

Fast forward now. Being as sick as I am. Needing help to a bath, food cooked for me. I still am not a mooch despite I can't work. I have SSD and SSI and give him whatever he asks, pay for rent, I have PAs come in and clean through my insurance. And try and reciprocate with gifts. I don't have much money as I can't work, he makes over $40,000 a year. I make under $900 a month and pay rent and give him my benefits care for food. And make sure the PAs can clean so he's not too burdened..his work hours are heavy. I still try to do stretches. Exercise bike. To try and get strength. My insurance finally approved me for infusions to try and help my cranial pressure and brain lesion issues. It would not for years. I'm on pain medicine in-between just to cope with the immense agony. After the infusion for weeks between the meds I sometimes pass out. My body gives out. He will go for a while, be an angel, it has turned to screaming at me at how I'm sh@t partner, an idiot, a m#therf#fucker, a c@nt. At the top of his lungs. Shook me if I wheel to the kitchen in the past about being a stupid b@tch "" if you fall I'll have to clean it up!""

It has now turned into SA territory to where I don't want to get into specifics. Last two times of being yelled at it was because he made me pancakes and my stomach was upset so I was very appreciative and said I'd save the rest for later. He screamed I was being an unappreciative partner. I said I would do my best to finish them then. I just wanted him to stop. So he screamed about that. Anything I said. 

If I ask for space I get a "" no "". I can't get to the wheelchair if I cry and say leave me alone while i try to get space I'll get tackled. The day before yesterday he screamed because I ordered door dash coffee. I rarely do it but my head pain was so severe and I just needed some caffeine to take the edge off. He said he was going back to sleep earlier. This was two days ago by the eay. 

He caught me grabbing it outside and screamed how I didn't get him coffee. I have gotten him coffee in the past but didn't know he wanted any. Or what kind this time. He said he was asleep. He yelled and I shook and pleaded with him to stop, that I was frightened, I recorded it secretly  as my therapist said to when I can and I'm just this sniveling curled up thing begging. 

He said he hadn't spent time with me and that I don't give a sh@t. We had been cuddling and watching Gen V days prior. But my body gives out sometimes and I literally can't stay conscious. He brought up gifts he's bought me and roses and how I don't get him sh@t. How "" everybody sees how horrible you are "" but I don't see any of his friends so I'm not sure what he means. This is untrue about reciprocation, I've gotten him gifts and cameos, with little funds I have. I even had a gift coming. Try to be affectionate but I get scared of physical contact so I try to smile. He said it didn't matter and now if I had a surprise being mailed as the surprise was ruined. I just was trying to let him know I was trying. But he said he didn't want it to or cared because it's probably it's something he wouldn't like, but he never made a list so I could buy something off of it. 

The next day he was soft spoken, smiles, made me cookies and bought me gifts. Hugs and kisses. He'd hug me and say I'm the best partner ever. How he's so lucky "" you've had a hard time and I know I'm apart of that "" in a sensitive voice. Now I can't help but seize up when he touches me. I'm terrified. He threatened a friend of mine with injury reasons I don't want to get into. Nothing that warrented with it. He'll just say he's jealous if I talk to people. He'll gauge if I'm texting on my phone. He'll listen outside the door. We sleep in separate rooms because I have trouble sometimes at night and he snores so I'm grateful for that space but sometimes he said he'll lay in the hallway and listen. So I have to be quiet. Especially if I'm needing support from friends from away or my therapist.

But I've been recording it over the years. The abuse. And the going on four years I've been predominantly bed ridden. Domestic violence shelters cannot help me, nor can case workers. Not with my level of ailments and care needed. They let me know blatantly there are no resources. He has helped me to to appointments and procedures, I have surgery coming up, still recovering from a spinal tap, which I pitch in ofcourse for gas or any hotel stay or food. I'm grateful. I tell him I am too. 

One infusion he grabbed my hand and put it on his crotch on the way there in the car. I was so exhausted. Even before it. 

I have care workers that are beyond unhelpful. Crisis lines. Anyone that could help me. I have no strength to even pack a box. My mother lives near by but is feeble. Other than that I have no family here. No friends.

All my friends moved from this town or are back east.

He will apologize for his behavior and say "" I'm sorry I will do better. "" But never does. And will not do couples counseling, I have tried to set it up. He said that he had a therapist and then that therapist said that all his problems are due to me and that his therapist would set me straight. My therapist said that that is not therapy protocol and makes no sense. He won't explain how the therapist said things are my fault though. I don't even know what I'm doing half the time. I used to yell back or fight back and I don't have the energy anymore. I keep my head down. Or I can't help crying which makes him more angry. Sometimes he holds me and he cries saying he can't live without me. Sometimes screams and says he'll ruin my life if I leave. He'll drag me to court.

The day before yesterday when I was able to record the last bout I left the video with friends I could send it to online. So I could be believed should he take my phone. I know those friends believe me but it's good to have this proof.

I have one friend that MIGHT be able to help me. I would not survive in the slums alone. With my level of finances in past complexes there were break ins, fires, gas leaks, ceiling caving in with floods and outlet sparks, housing does not care nor does maintenance with these places. And I wasn't as sick as I am now then even. If I had a fall or seizure alone. Many days I cannot lift my head. 

And insurance cuts have made it harder and harder for even more help and resources. I even tried to go to one care facility for a break for what I could afford, the nurses treated me like an animal. Denied my seizure meds, said I wasn't even on them despite proof, doctors would not communicate, messed with my pain meds, and closed the door when I needed breathing treatments, all of which I could prove I needed. It was hell. 

I have no options. I dunno if my friend can help. Or even how. No one's going to be able to care for me. Even he knows it. He reminds me "" you have no where to go bitch. You'll die without me. "". Then the next day he'll get me a bistro dinner and try and cuddle and send me funny photos and say "" I love you so much "". If I don't reply in a timely manner it's repercussions.

Between the pain and this, I don't know how much longer I can take it. My friends that saw the video. I didn't want to stress them but I just wanted them to know. I warned them first what it entailed. One of them from England did a video call with me just to give support and it meant so much. My friend of 24 years said he could try with his wife but it's really no guarantee. Have so many allergies and mobility issues. If I heard him cry would destroy me. That's what would reel me back. If I ever had a chance to leave and he caught me. But most likely it would be screaming in him calling the cops to get people off the property that would be helping me move.

If by some miracle I could get away id miss his daughter who visits, his grandma. I have no family aside my mom. Which he helps sometimes. I can't drive due to the sscd. I couldn't have children due to how severe the Endo was, had organs removed due it so needed the total hyst. So I cry thinking about how I'd have to say goodbye to his daughter who visits. She's very sweet. 

I live in a dark room. Trying to breath and even stretch it bed when he isn't home. He put a mini fridge by my bed and microwave which is nice. He won't let the PAs touch the washer and dryer, they can wash my clothes but he won't allow it. So rarely clean clothes or clean towels. Days he is so sweet he carries me to the bathroom when I can't move much. Helps me with an Epsom salt bath.

I'm at a point if accepting my fait. I have a young friend, long distance for years. I love her. And she has hints of a chronic illness budding. Her husband is showing signs like that. I feel it is too late for me so I just let her know, with what health she has I hope it gets better or never to my point. But her husband gets better or she gets out before it ever gets like my life.  

The pain I'm in, how the lesions and symptoms are slowly destroying me, and terror from the screaming, I'm fine it there's no after life. I won't attempt because it's not like the movies. Not simple. I'm not the praying type but I still try. Years I've tried. 

That someone can help me. Because no resources can. The crisis lines has only said my name and "" we're so sorry, please hang in there "". I don't have anything else to hang on to.

If you read all that thank you very much. I hope you don't judge me too much. ",1,1765118662.0,abusiverelationships,3,1.0,False

1pgjwj2,https://v.redd.it/82jiqq82ns5g1,"Nepal fought corruption, why can’t we","
I woke up today an saw a post which is proven to be true on how the department of homeland security’s twitter page was ran from Tel Aviv…that alone should say enough. But what really baffles me is how we have the numbers, an how we’re letting this country go to complete shit. Chaos/destruction always brings creation. How many more times will we allow our government to betray an make life harder for us. Physical oppression, financial oppression, spiritual oppression. Something has to be done realistically.
Things to note: The federal reserve was not supposed to be a thing. The titanic is then announced in 1912 an alot of the worlds financial leaders were supposed to be on there(some opposing to the federal reserve) or in simple terms opposing to the NWO. “Several prominent people, including J.P. Morgan, Milton S. Hershey, and George Washington Vanderbilt II, were scheduled to sail on the Titanic but canceled their trips and did not go” Take into account they weren’t the richest men at that time. There were wealthier righteous men who opposed the federal reserve. An I don’t mean righteous as in they are saints. I mean righteous in terms of, they weren’t in cahoots with the other side which is why they never got the opportunity to magically cancel there trip. Instead they were lured an baited on a boat that was meant to sink. The opposing side who wanted the federal reserve played chess an knocked off the previous kings/queens/bishops off the board. Ultimately resorting in them rising into power(things being under their control) Then peep how the federal reserve was not a thing until 1913, shortly after 1914 to be exact; World War 1 is started. How is this not looked at as suspicious or something to question better yet how is this not seen as a setup for the American people to purposely crash the economy/keep people distracted. 
- 1912 Titanic Sinks with people on it who had the power and wealth to fight off the evil people. 
- The people who were targeted to parish when the titanic sank were opposed to the federal reserve.
 - 1913 The aftermath of titanic, leads to the federal reserve being created. One year is all it took. Seems odd…
- 1914 to 1918 World War 1… seems staged or forced better yet. To avoid people asking questions or digging deeper as to why the titanic sank then the reserve was created a diversion is then created. So they(the evil people) start a war. 
Simply just a distraction but also as a test to see there control/how easily manipulated the American people are. 
- Shortly after buy now pay later is created(credit) I know for a fact that some soldiers questioned if that war was worth fighting. So to avoid people from thinking or seeking the truth or real answers/ to prevent any top of rising the government then throws another bone(distraction) an credit becomes a thing with two purposes to be served. Purpose 1 distract the people by allowing them the fancy things they want but could never really afford, that’ll make them not see the corruption or bad things the evil people were doing.
A purpose 2 drive the wedge between each financial class/create debt for the common folk to bury them while boosting their own financial status. Shortly after the roaring 1920’s of everyone splurging having a blast being ignorant as to why America went to war…or why something that was opposed was in effect. We see a rapid decline in the economy leading to the Great Depression(1930) meaning 10 years was all it took for the higher ups to drain and liquidate the pockets of the American people ultimately setting them(the American people) back, an the economy back but boosting the financial status of the evil ones who wanted the federal reserve. Something needs to be done. Someone else has to see the pattern or see through the lies/setup an plights our government has set. 
Key thing to note: The wars were never won. They were won on the forefront but on the backend they weren’t. 
Revolutionary war- American Patriots fighting for independence against British rule, but also against fellow colonists who remained loyal to the Crown (Loyalists)
Civil war- The United States (Union) against the seceded Confederate States (South)
Those victories were hard fought but at the same time they were given with a bigger agenda at hand. The wars were simply distractions. An a time period for the evil ones to conspire. Rome was not built overnight is a saying for a reason…the plotting of tearing down a country took time for the evil ones. So false progress was given to keep the American people comfortable, an we all know there is never growth in comfort.  “Winning”the revolutionary war simply was a front we won but at the same time it made them plot an sent the loyalist in hiding an obviously they would think of a bigger plan to take over. Then the civil war. Now Americans fighting amongst themselves…first we fought against threat but then against ourselves which would obviously give opportunity for the loyalist from the revolutionary war to recruit people that were within our own country…some who would eventually grow into power one day…recruiting young or better yet being in cahoots with Americans who lost during the civil war an want to rise to power by any means but can’t necessarily do it right away. So they play the long game. Ultimately winning. This country was built off the backs of the common people, a lot of death, an deceit. With destruction comes creation. An the evil higher ups have destroyed on many occasions to create a tighter grip/grasp upon the common folk. 

We have to take some type of stand because we gotta really think, how will our children’s circumstances be…or our grandchildren. We are in an era where we have the resources an information to easily gain the truth but also to fight for the truth. Our generation is nothing like the last because we are the wake up call for this country. An eventually it’ll be in our hands. But if we don’t take a stand or start fixing things corruption will always run this country. An we will always be sheep. To some extent we gotta wake up an smell the coffee a realize is it worth slaving a being oppressed by a bunch of old evil non spirit having greedy men. A change needs to come or we’ll eventually end up under control by a whole new country or better yet we’ll all end up dead. Because with the type of government we have they’ll try to trap us before they let us out. An better yet they’ll try to kill us before truth can come out. The rabbit hole gets real deep. But all the higher higher ups are in cahoots. The president’s really hold no power because there are people in the background that fund it all. An it’s a common saying but big bank takes little bank. People need to wake up. 
Me knowing how my generation is there’s a chance you probably haven’t read this whole thing but if you did. It shows your concern an initiative to wanting better for this country an for yourself/future generations to come. 
Solution: A discord is made. We replicate the same structure of how Nepals Genz group did an we make a change happen💯

Hello dear Skyblockers, I am John **kotkowski**, the used-to-be **successful business owner** on hypixel skyblock. Difficult times pushed me into near-bankruptcy. Inflation, minion unions, and that communist mayor...  

All of that lead me into places, you don't want to ever visit...

That place was like a drug, it destroyed me... But I managed to get away, and changed. I noticed ways to improve my business, to improve our lives. The **TECHNOLOGY**. 

Our current progress doesn't allow to sustain high-power factories and mass productions, and then there are unions, blocking any decision that would result in progression. So I decided to start small. Along few fellow engineers, we've **constructed a prototype of great EX-CAVE-TOR 3000**, the stone-digging excavator, allowing faster processing or ore, and somehow flowers, meat and many other materials.

I can't claim credit for creating those, but I can sell them. To you.

What do they do you might ask?

It's simple. **EFFICIENCY**!

With that little treasure, **sipping diesel like coffee**, you can double, no, **triple your minion efficiency**! It won't increase the production speed, but will increase the output.

Our prototype is very gentle though, it's only able to process refined bio-fuel, similarly to a drill. It'll **consume 1 fuel per second, granting 3x of regular minion output**, additive with other, similar modifiers. 

Minion placed inside will also require bigger area to generate ores, but it won't waste extra turn to generate ore block/animal, skipping straight to the mining! Isn't that neat?

**(Warning! Stock is very limited, you might only purchase 3 of our prototype EX-CAVE-TOR 3000 per island)**

How much will it cost you may ask? I just need to get close to the mayor, enough to convince them to let me sell that little treasure. So **vote on me**, John **kotkowski**, and let's industrialize skyblock!

This resort is definitely experiencing growing pains.  Service is slow almost everywhere.  The staff are pleasant but not well trained.  For example, we asked where a particular restaurant was located and were given hilariously wrong directions.  Another time we asked for a map and were told there was one on the app.  We couldn’t find the map on the app and asked someone else about it and was told there was no map because the old map was too confusing.

Food is pretty meh.  I’ve seen people rave about the food and I don’t get it.  Even the Mexican food is underwhelming.  Some of the food is really bad (agadashi tofu was not fried) and there are long waits in the à la carte restaurants.  The buffet was actually ok and the coffee shop (Coco Cafe) makes quality coffee drinks.

Drinks are just ok.  There’s better liquors than I’d expect, but when I asked for a mojito in the preferred club lounge, the bartender asked if I wanted Belvedere.  Poolside cocktails seem watered down.

The preferred club is a misnomer.  Everyone comes and goes anywhere they want and no one is checking.  Kind of a bummer if you’ve paid an upcharge.

The beach is small, but lovely.

Rooms are nice, with good views and fairly clean.  There’s a lot of work going on at the resort but it doesn’t seem to get in the way of anything.  Of course there is no spa open; if that’s important, wait until March.

We got a very good rate and it’s “worth it”.  But I would never comeback unless we got a great deal — there are too many better places in the area.",0,1765117977.0,hyatt,7,0.5,False

I woke up this morning and my partner wasn’t in bed. Their phone somehow sent this long text to my phone at 02:37. There’s no sign of their phone anywhere in the flat; I can’t find it. When I called their number it played a recorded message saying the person is unavailable. The apartment is locked, windows closed, no sign of a struggle, no note. Keys and wallet where they always are. I called friends and neighbours and the police are on their way, but I wanted to put this here in case anyone recognises anything in the text or saw someone around our street last night. I’m terrified and I don’t know what else to do.

I grabbed a new mug today—bright yellow and oddly cheerful; it made me think of that market we wandered through last summer.

need to pick up milk on the way home tomorrow; the cereal’s getting sad in the box.

you should try that new playlist I sent; the second track is ridiculous in the best way.

to remind you about the dentist appointment next week—don’t worry, I’ll reschedule if it clashes.

promise me we’ll finally watch that terrible rom-com you love; I’ll make popcorn and you pick the film.

me and the cat had a staring contest and I lost; she’s very smug about it.

something. I found a postcard with a lighthouse on it and it made me smile.

Don’t forget to water the little succulents on the windowsill; they’re surviving on stubbornness.

leave a note on the fridge if you want me to pick up anything else; I’ll check it in the morning.

the kettle whistles like an old song and I always think of you when it does.

bedroom curtains need a wash but they look charmingly lived-in; we can do it Sunday.

tonight I’ll put the kettle on before I turn in so the house smells like chamomile.

I made a tiny list of things to do this week; it’s embarrassingly short but satisfying.

keep the receipt from the plant shop—there’s a loyalty stamp and we’re almost at a free pot.

hearing the neighbour’s radio through the wall made me hum along to a song I don’t know the words to.

footsteps on the pavement outside sounded like someone hurrying to catch a bus; I hope they made it.

in the kitchen I found that jar of olives you like; I hid it behind the pasta so it lasts longer.

the light in the hallway flickered earlier but then steadied; probably just the bulb settling.

hall, I left the umbrella by the door because the forecast said drizzle and I’m a coward about rain.

but the toast burned slightly and I rescued it with butter; it was still edible and triumphant.

every plant on the sill has a name now; I can’t remember them all but I call them friends.

time for bed is my favourite time because the house sighs and the city quiets down.

I brewed the tea a little stronger than usual; it felt like a small act of rebellion.

check, the lamp by the armchair is crooked again; I’ll straighten it tomorrow without drama.

you’re on my mind because you always are; I hope your evening was gentle.

asleep the cat curled into a perfect comma on the blanket and I almost took a photo.

right now I’m thinking about toast toppings and whether marmalade is underrated.

beside the mug I left a note that said “don’t forget to smile” and then I laughed at myself.

me. I’m making a ridiculous playlist called “Midnight Snacks and Bad Decisions.”

I found a pen that writes like a whisper; it makes lists feel important.

even the smallest things—like a warm mug—can feel like a tiny ceremony.

touched the plant leaves to check if they were thirsty and they were not; victory.

your socks are probably in the laundry basket; I’ll fold them into a neat, suspiciously small pile.

hand cream is on the bedside table if you want it; lavender, because you like the smell.

just a reminder: the takeaway place closes early on Sundays, so order before nine.

now it seems silly to write so many small notes, but I like the ritual of it.

was there a new episode of that show you follow? I’ll queue it up for tomorrow.

warm, the blanket smells faintly of the detergent you prefer; it’s oddly comforting.

steady. The kettle is patient; it waits for me to remember it exists.

But the neighbour’s cat knocked over a plant and I had to rescue the soil from the carpet.

the recipe I tried turned out surprisingly well; I’ll make it again and we can pretend it was intentional.

sound of rain on the window is oddly musical tonight; I kept the window cracked a little.

keeps happening—little domestic disasters that make me laugh when I think of you.

coming, the postman left a postcard with a silly stamp; I put it on the mantle.

pacing around the kitchen while I decide between jam flavours is my secret talent.

back and forth I went between strawberry and marmalade until I chose both.

and then I realised we have too many mugs and not enough shelf space.

forth, I rearranged the shelf and now the mugs look like they’re gossiping.

stopping only to taste-test the jam was the best part of the evening.

right where the light hits the table the crumbs look like constellations.

outside the window a couple walked their dog and the dog wore a tiny sweater.

the neighbour’s porch light is on and it makes the street look like a stage.

door. I left a silly magnet on it that says “home” in a font that’s trying too hard.

It’s funny how small rituals make a house feel like ours.

not everything needs to be fixed tonight; some things can wait until morning.

breaking the routine would be dramatic and unnecessary; I prefer gentle habits.

in the cupboard the mugs are stacked by size and sentiment.

It’s comforting to have a predictable shelf.

not every night has to be memorable; ordinary is underrated.

trying a new tea blend felt like an adventure and it was only mildly disappointing.

to be honest, I like the quiet that comes after the city sleeps.

scare me with a bad pun and I’ll forgive you immediately.

me. I’ll leave the light on a little longer so you don’t stumble.

It’s a small kindness to leave the kettle warm for morning.

only the cat will judge my late-night snack choices.

waiting. the cat will also steal any unattended crisps.

And I made a list of breakfast ideas for tomorrow—pancakes, maybe, if we’re feeling ambitious.

the jam you like is on the top shelf; I’ll bring it down in the morning.

worst case scenario: we run out of milk and have to improvise with water and optimism.

part of me wants to write a novel about our tiny domestic triumphs.

is, the toaster is a hero in its own right.

I scribbled a doodle on the back of a receipt and it looks suspiciously like a map.

think of it as a tiny treasure hunt for tomorrow’s breakfast.

it will be fine; the city has a way of keeping its promises.

knows where we keep the spare keys and the emergency chocolate.

I’m going to set an alarm for a reasonable hour and then ignore it.

writing lists makes me feel like I’m preparing for a picnic we might never have.

this all sounds trivial but it’s how I keep track of the day.

to anyone else it’s just a string of small chores; to me it’s a ritual.

you. you’ll find the jam in the back, behind the emergency marmalade.

If you wake and want toast, I’ll be up making it without ceremony.

you should text me the time you want coffee and I’ll be there with a mug.

wake gently and stretch; the morning is soft if you let it be.

up slowly and take the corner bites first like we always do.

and don’t forget to laugh at the terrible puns I’ll inevitably make.

see the little things tomorrow and we’ll make a list of more.

me being silly is my way of saying I’m thinking of you.

staring at the ceiling sometimes helps me untangle the day.

at three in the morning I once decided to alphabetise the spice rack and it felt profound.

the moment I find a new favourite jam I will tell you immediately.

door, the magnet still says “home” and it makes me inexplicably proud.

don’t worry about the small things tonight; they’ll wait.

ask me about the postcard in the morning and I’ll tell you the story.

me later, if you want, I’ll read you the ridiculous playlist names.

what’s for breakfast is negotiable; I’m flexible and hungry.

wrong. If the toast burns, we’ll call it “charcoal chic” and move on.

Just keep the kettle warm and the mugs within reach.

stay cozy and don’t let the cold find you.

quiet. the house hums a lullaby if you listen closely.

Because the city lights look like a scattering of coins from the window.

if you want, I’ll leave the curtains slightly open so the moon can peek in.

I won’t make a fuss about the little things; I’ll save the fuss for when it matters.

answer me in the morning with a single word and I’ll know what you mean.

you don’t need to write a novel back; a thumbs-up will do.

out of all the small rituals, making coffee for you is my favourite.

loud… I’ll keep the music low so the neighbours don’t judge our taste.

I’m going to put the kettle on now and then try to sleep.

not because I’m worried—just because I like the routine.

sure that tomorrow will be ordinary and kind.

who knew jam could be such a philosophical topic?

will you pick the playlist for breakfast?

respond. with a time and I’ll be there with toast.

I think I’m waffling too much.

Love you. Text me in the morning; strawberry jam, corner bites first.

I’m posting this because the text felt wrong in a way I can’t explain, we’ve been in an okay place. His parents had died a few months ago which has been hard on us but we’ve been getting there.

I tried calling again just now before posting this and the line connected, but no one spoke. I swear I could hear someone typing on a phone in the background, like fingers on glass.

I've been searching for a little while for the right ""seeking pen pal"" ad to respond to, but always seems to be late to the gate or get no response back. So, I guess it's time to shoot my own penpal shot, so to speak lol. 

I'm looking for someone to exchange letters, quotes, sketches/doodles, stickers, or whatever else can fit into an envelope. I put a lot of care and thought into what I send. But I'm also fine with an occasional quick postcard! (I've started collecting them). Mostly, I'm looking for a longterm connection and a friendship, should one arise. We can talk about whatever.  I'd really like to just take a step back from the world of technology and focus on real, tangible things again. Letters, books, collections, actual photographs, etc. There's just something about pen & paper! 

I'm 35, happily married, and a mom. I live in the US (east coast) and am happy to send to other countries -  I enjoy learning about other places & cultures! I love to make art, it's my true passion. I love literature; to read (not as often as I want to) and to write (not as well as I wish I could). I like spending time outdoors when time & weather permits. Coffee & tea are my one true vice. I like to bake, I used to have a fairly successful side business doing so pre-covid... Now it's just a hobby :)  Sometimes I listen to true crime podcasts while I cook, because what's a relaxing happy moment without a little dark depravity - life's all about balance. 😅 

If you want to pen back & forth with someone that's casual, kind, sometimes silly, or even a little chaotic (because anxiety, amirite?) - introduce yourself! I'd prefer another female in my age range, but I'm open to any platonic friendships! ",3,1765117744.0,penpals,2,1.0,False

We have been living together since I was a kid. To sum it up, he lives with us and his mom lives somewhere else. amy dad raised us up as brothers or at least tried to. 

Not sure what’s been going on but ever since he’s hit 6th grade, his behavior slowly started to change. He became increasingly more annoying like trying to turn of my computer or trying to seem likes he’s bigger than me. He will also flat out try and lie about something to my parents to try and get me in trouble. 

I felt like my final straw was when he hit my food out of my hand because I drank a soda in our fridge that he wanted (mind you that kid drank about 6-8 of them). He also turned off my pc because he tried to order me around and I wasn’t going for it. Not going to say we full on fought but he tried it and I ended up throwing him to the ground and he hit his foot on the wall. He hasn’t really tried anything like that again and I felt bad the entire day. 

Most of my nephews and nieces all kind of don’t take me seriously either because of my age. Though they don’t go to the same lengths as him they just don’t listen when I tell them something unless I get another “adult” involved. 

I feel like now he’s also trying to become more like the kids around him. I went to his middle school so I know exactly what type of person he’s trying to become and that’s not him at all. At his birthday party, they tried to cut cake for him, the entire time he was on his phone, and looked down and only speaking with hand movements or nods to seem cool in-front of his friends. He was also trying to walk away and the way he was speaking is why I believe I know what type of people he’s hanging out with. 

That entire time, all I could do was just look at him and it wasn’t a nice look. I felt like he reminded me of how I was in middle school. I wasn’t like he was but I was trying to change my behavior to fit in with people whom I don’t talk to because I didn’t like the path they would have made me walk. I tried talking to him and getting him to open his eyes but it’s too late for him. I’m sure that’s one reason as to why I feel this way about him. 

Another would be how easy he has it I guess. He gets away with so much. I would have gotten a beating or grounded for just thinking about doing anything he had. I mean my dad has tried to fight me for forgetting to vacuum or forgetting his coffee in the microwave but he gets to do with he wants and doesn’t even get held accountable. 

What made me type this has to due with a dream i had today. In my dream, he was harassing me and it was a playback to the first time I threw him on the ground when he tried to fight me. This time though, it wasn’t a throw on the ground but I ended up choking him. It wasn’t a hard one but a playful one and he didn’t like it. I remember seeing him come back to my room with a knife and tears in his eyes and it was like I didn’t hold back any punches against him. I woke up feeling disgusted and knew I had issues.

Also, English is not my first language, so please excuse any mistakes.

I (f, 17) live with my brother (14), my mom (42), and my dad (45). Our household is a complete mess. My dad works as a delivery driver, but he basically doesn’t get paid. It has been like this for at least two years. He always says he will get paid on the 20th (I’m not sure about the exact date), but he never does. Then he says his boss will send it next Monday, and so on. Sometimes he brings home maybe 600 euros and says his boss will give him the rest soon. Occasionally he brings home a full payment, but even that isn’t enough.
   This means my mom has to take care of everything. She pays for groceries, school lunches, transportation, school events, phone bills, the mortgage, and so much more. She makes about 1240 euros a month, which means she doesn’t have much left by the end of the month and doesn’t have many savings. You would think my dad would be grateful, but no. I don’t know if he has some kind of mental issue, but I have never met a meaner person.
   He yells at us for no reason. He constantly says we’re spoiled and ungrateful, that we only care about money, even though that’s not true. He doesn’t help around the house at all. Every day he comes home from work, makes himself a coffee, sits outside smoking for at least two hours, then takes a shower and goes to sleep. After doing absolutely nothing, he still gets angry at my mom for vacuuming on Sunday “because you’re not supposed to do anything on Sunday.”
   My brother plays hockey, and my dad is always yelling at him telling him he’s bad, useless, fat, dumb, and so much more. I try my best not to provoke him, so he usually just yells at me about cleaning my room or something equally stupid.
   Earlier this week, I broke down in front of my mom and told her how badly all of this is affecting my mental health. She told me she knows, and that she will try her best to leave him. I’m just scared of how hard that will be.
   Right now, we live in a small house with a garden. My parents took out a mortgage for the house, and my mom paid the initial amount needed to even get the mortgage. She is the one paying it off every month, so technically she has already paid her half. The problem is that my mom has other debts too, because of my father. I know that the court would split the debts and she wouldn’t have to pay everything by herself, but I’m still worried. My mom said she would like to keep the house but doesn’t have the money to buy my dad out, so that’s another issue.
  I’ve tried and am still trying to get a job, but because I go to school in another city and don’t get home until around 5 pm, it’s really hard to find something where I could work only on weekends.
   I’m just so mentally exhausted from all of this. So I want to know if any of you have gone through a divorce when you didn’t have much money and your husband was an absolute asshole, did things work out in the end? Are things better now?

We would have normally spent it drunk from early morning to late night. But the other day, I told him I didn’t want to do it this time. He let me know it dropped in price. One of the best prices we’ve ever seen actually. I told him I’m not very happy with where my drinking has been and I’m not very good at moderation, so I’d rather go without. 

Why self sabotage?? I would have heard what a good deal it is and decided to wait to stop drinking after the cruise. I would want my moneys worth, or at least that’s what I’d tell myself. So I’d drink stuff I don’t actually want. I don’t love any of the stuff they have on the ship, but that’s what they have and it’s close enough. I sabotaged myself by having one moment of courage and saying “I don’t want to do this” and now the price has gone up. And my cheapness works in that direction too. Oops. Not getting a good deal. Too late to get it now. Instead I got the refreshment package which has water, soda, coffee, shakes, and mocktails. I’ll even buy the boyfriend a drink or two because it is affecting him and he was a good sport about it. ",6,1765117269.0,stopdrinking,8,1.0,False

Hey guys

I work at a stand in a cold state, for now I’m not going to specify. However, our stand has only two booths outside, one on lane one and one all the way at the end of our line for taking orders. We have a heater inside our stand as well next to lane one. HOWEVER. These booths don’t have working heaters, there is one in the top and bottom of the booth. If one is running typically it is fine, but either your feet will get extremely cold or your face. If both are on, it will blow fuses. The last few times we have tried to have all the heaters on like we are supposed to, the power blew for all of them and they wouldn’t turn back on. 

Back story over, last Tuesday it was -12 degrees in the morning. Schools were delayed, construction sites were closed, but coffee must go on. I’m a shift supervisor and wanted to keep my baristas inside as much as possible. I had three of us that morning, one on lane, two on machine. I had myself on lane, and had no heater because it wouldn’t work. I did rotate and come inside as needed, however I ended up getting what I assume is a type of first degree frost bite, it’s 4 days later and my lips are swollen still, burned, and scabbing over. 

Management has told us they are bringing more booths, they told us Nov 1st…it’s now almost Christmas. They denied my manager purchasing gloves for everyone. They also keep taking maybe a week to come and fix the heaters just for them to break the next day, so there is never a day with heat. They keep telling us to tell customers we are taken care of when we are not. As a shift I’m exhausted don’t know what to do. I’ve been looking for other jobs but the pay doesn’t compete where I am. Part of me wants to sue. Is that something I should do and how should I do it?

I mean the old ppl of nowadays and all their assets and stacked bank account are kinda prove of that. Even the ‘lower class elderly’ usually have some savings.

It seems like tho nowadays ppl just seem to get in debt.. some whose debt most likely wont even be paid in their life time.

And it seems this is the case in almost every country. I live in the Middle East, many seem so fcked here. I am from North Europe, ppl seem fcked there too. I have family in the US and even the ‘more comfortable’ familymembers arent as ‘cheery’ when it comes to money

Like I just wonder.. is this solely cause of everything being more expensive or is it partly also our lifestyle? I mean most of our grandparents would rarely eat out.. would def never buy fancy matcha’s.. travelling? Whats that. Designer? Over their dead body.

I mean my grandparents were quite comfortable, but I know they d turn in their grave if they knew I sometimes spend 8 dollars on average tasting coffee outside 🤣

1pgjd0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Breakupadvice/comments/1pgjd0y/just_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_i_need_help/,Just broke up with my girlfriend… I need help.,"Hi I am a 21 year old male with borderline personality disorder and ADHD. While I know I have that I don’t know the full extent of symptoms from them I do know that it can make ending friendships and romantic relationships a lot harder. I am really struggling. I had been with my now ex I guess for 8 months, in all honesty I had broke it off before after 9 months but felt like I was ready and we started talking again and it lead to us getting back together. Granted I most likely wasn’t ready to begin with. Besides that part we kept going and overtime I noticed the same attributes from the first time we were together start to come back however I did notice she was a lot better at improving..for some time. It would always be a cycle.. it gets so bad that I almost leave or contemplate leaving, we talk about it, she fixes whatever it is temporarily, then whenever I seem comfortable and content again it starts all over. Along with that I was expected to FaceTime at night and be on the phone anytime I had free time and even though towards the end it got better she would get mad and start being distant/off if I didn’t wanna call at the moment or answer. Another thing is she did not trust me, a few days ago I had came into work 4 hours after the shift had started bc they had flexed me but someone wanted me to take over for them so I did. That day her responses were very dry and I was trying to help the best I could bc I knew something was wrong but she never confided in me really. She just says “I’ll be fine.” Well that same day she was extra off when I said I was going to work and denied anything being wrong then later at work instead of being supportive and saying she’s glad I got to get the hours (ended up being a 12 hour shift) she says “you promise you are going there to work and not to see someone.” Mind you I have never done anything to betray her trust but she has before (not full on cheating but definitely betraying my trust). Yet I still don’t check her location, I trusted her. This isn’t the first time either, she confuses me bc we had a mutual agreement that we can have guys and girl friends with obvious boundaries of course. If she wasn’t okay with that then I would have agreed for us not to or at least if I do just be very transparent with it. She can trust me so I wouldn’t have minded that. However she stated she trusted me and that everything was okay but any friend that I had that was a girl that she knew about she would basically say “I can’t get out of my head that you are doing stuff with…” I get the reassurance aspect but it became so much so often. One time too like two weeks ago she got upset with me bc I clocked out a little later than normal which she even had the normal time wrong. She zoomed in to my location and stated that all she saw was me at a coffee cart for 6 minutes. That’s how deep it goes stalking my location for that. Then when I was taken a back by that she said “why am I not allowed to be upset.” Then later I mention how she’s not taking this relationship as serious and she doesn’t answer to that and when I ask if she’s gonna respond she just says “I don’t have anything to say nor do I know what you want me to say to that.” So in a sense I kind of felt like she validated what I was thinking. After that she drove off all abruptly (I have her location for safety and it notified me she left her house) which also terrified me because about 2 1/2 months ago she had a huge wave of depression and was posting a lot of suicidal ideation on her Instagram story and wasn’t confiding in me with it. So I was constantly worried whenever she left that she was gonna go do something to herself. We continued on for a bit then I almost ended things and like I said she promises me a lot of things, stuff seems to go back into a “honeymoon phase” then it goes back to the way it was 1-3 weeks later. Another thing she would do is ignore me completely if something bothered her or if she felt like it and her tone/snapping w me was constant. She asked me to tell her when that happens bc she doesn’t realize then would get mad when I mentioned it. Also with her and I, I feel like I’m more so wanting an adult relationship and she isn’t at the same maturity level I am. What I mean is as responses she would just make noises, behaviors exhibiting what a child would do, very self centered most of the time. Another thing is I noticed our communication styles and our values in life are very different in some aspects. 

So with me admitting all of this why do I need help. Because DESPITE all of this I have told you I feel like I’m making the wrong decision. It helps to rant however we had a three hour phone call last night prior to me breaking up officially today and she made so many promises and compromises that in my head I’m starting to believe and feeling like shit. It’s also because the day was going pretty good but I felt so mentally checked out of the relationship for so long. I guess in my head I’m asking all the what if’s, what if it does change for good this time, I feel guilt, I don’t know if I’m making the right decision, I am scared for her mental health and it hurts to stop sharing location, seeing her friends already unfollowing me, the removing of backgrounds, her describing a date she wanted to take me on, her saying she still loves me and she’s here if I ever need anything. It’s all messing with my head and I know I most likely made the right decision it’s just hard bc she seems so broken and everything she said in the phone seemed genuine but I also don’t want her to change who she is as a person for me.

I currently live in NYC and I'm looking to move. I've lived here for 4 years and I am so over it. It's too busy, loud, dirty, and I hate that I'm 30 and living with 3 other women. I've moved around a lot before this but never quite felt like I fit right in any of the places I've lived. So far I've lived all over Florida, then Greensboro North Carolina, Frederick Maryland, DC proper, and now Brooklyn. 

I miss being outside and I'd love to live in the mountains somewhere. I used to car camp a lot and I'd like to get back to that and hiking. I don't mind a roommate but I'd like to get away from having 3 at my age. So somewhere more affordable would be great, it doesn't have to be a city even. I would honestly love a smaller town as long as I still have access to things within a reasonable driving distance. Think Stars Hollow vibes lol. I love a coffee shop or a thrift store visit. I have dietary restrictions so a place with a decent gluten free scene would be amazing. I'd love a blue state but am not opposed to a blue-er area in a red state. 

I manage a restaurant right now, but I also have years or serving and bartending under my belt. Plus I am getting my esthetics license and would transfer it to wherever I move next, so I'm not too concerned with not being able to find work anywhere. I have options and I've always been resourceful when it comes to taking care of myself financially.

If you have a place you love living in, I'd love to hear about it and why. Even if it doesn't necessarily match my wants I'd love to hear your experience. And if you have a place you think I'd like to live next, I'd love to consider it. I'm hoping to move in this new year. Thank you! ",13,1765116938.0,AskWomenOver30,67,0.84,False

1pgjcbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/7Brew/comments/1pgjcbn/frostbite/,Frostbite,"Hey guys

I work at a stand in a cold state, for now I’m not going to specify. However, our stand has only tow booths outside, one on lane one and one all the way at the end of our line for texting. We have a heater inside our stand as well next to lane one. HOWEVER. These booths don’t have working heaters, there is one in the top and bottom of the booth. If one is running typically it is fine, but either your feet will get extremely cold or your face. If both are on, it will blow fuses. The last few times we have tried to have all the heaters on like we are supposed to, the power blew for all of them and they wouldn’t turn back on. 

Back story over, last Tuesday it was -12 degrees in the morning. Schools were delayed, construction sites were closed, but coffee must go on. I’m a shift supervisor and wanted to keep my baristas inside as much as possible. I had three of us that morning, one on lane, two on machine. I had myself on lane, and had no heater because it wouldn’t work. I did rotate and come inside as needed, however I ended up getting what I assume is a type of first degree frost bite, it’s 4 days later and my lips are swollen still, burned, and scabbing over. 

Management has told us they are being more booths, they told us Nov 1st…it’s now almost Christmas. They denied my manager purchasing gloves for everyone. They also keep taking maybe a week to come and fix the heaters just for them to break the next day, so there is never a day with heat. They keep telling us to tell customers we are taken care of when we are not. As a shift I’m exhausted don’t know what to do. I’ve been looking for other jobs but the pay doesn’t compete where I am. Part of me wants to sue. What should I do?",2,1765116898.0,7Brew,1,1.0,False
