Napadaan lang kami ng partner ko sa marikina coffee festival kahapon. Hindi kami familiar sa mga coffee stalls doon pero madalas nakikita kong recommended dito sa subreddit mga coffee shops here. So, sumubok kami at di kami dismayado kahit 180 isa (pricey samin pero gets ko since masarap talaga). Naging prductive araw ko after drinking this hahaha sorry oa pero sa tagal ko umiinom ng coffee ngayon lang ako natuwa.

Will try Agimat and Presenta (tama ba? I forgot the name pero tapat lang ng kape bonito) at please daan kayo sa Marikina Coffe festival hanggang today na lang sila.

I'm so shook up and devastated. My 6 year old lab mix bit my 14 month old yesterday. I'm at a loss on what to do. It was completely my fault and I'm just so upset with myself. 

My dog was sleeping on the couch and I walked into the living room and placed my son on the couch for a moment. In an instant, he crawled to the dog and climbed on top of him. My dog woke up and looked a bit confused, and by the time I walked around the coffee table to both of them my dog ""bit"" my son. I use bit in quotations because it all happened too fast for me to register, but my son has a small scratch on his cheek (no skin broken). My son cried for a minuet out of shock but then was unphased. 

My 6 year old dog has never shown signs of aggression towards people, he doesnt love other dogs and has snapped at a couple of them but has never bitten another dog or person before. 

I'm at a loss. I know it was my fault. I was so diligent when my son was born, and have become so relaxed because my dog has done so well. I can't believe I set them both up for failure like this. 

On one hand I know this was provoked so I don't blame my dog, but I'm still so shocked and devastated it happened and terrified of it happening again. ",1,1729385511.0,Mommit,0,1.0,False

1g7n44f,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1g7n44f/my_crush_32f_keeps_reaching_out_while_saying_she/,"My crush (32F) keeps reaching out, while saying she uncertain about her feelings towards me","My crush (32F) and I (33M) met on tinder. We instantly had a great connection, great conversation. Same values, same hobbies, same political views etc.

After our first (great) date, she reach out to me saying she wants to see me again. She asked me out on a movie date at my place. During this date she seemed to be uncomfortable but we were able to connected on a little bit deeper level and ended up cuddling in bed. But in the morning she was back to the uncomfortable state, incapable of telling me what's wrong. I was very disconcerted. She left quite quickly, telling me that she was going to write me.

She did write, explaining that she really likes me, she wants to see me again BUT she is really unsure how she feel about me. I took it surprisingly hard and ended up telling her how I feel (that I really like her, that I'm way more disappointed that I usually am in this kind of situations etc.) It was way to soon and to intense but we talked on the phone and after a couple of days of little to no contact she proposed a drink. We had fun and she offered me to come see a movie at her place sometime.

Sometime happened to be a week later. We had a great night at her place. Great connection and Deep conversation during wish I learned about some insecurities of her and some traumatic experiences with previous boyfriends. (I will not tell the specifics here but believe me, what happened was crazy enough to make her doubt herself and everyone around her for the rest of her life.). We spent the night cuddling in her bed, this time she seemed way more calm and relaxed. But as soon as we woke up, she started being uncomfortable again. Knowing a bit more about her back story I was able not to take it personally nor overthink it. I went home really happy, thinking about the best way to make her feel safe an secure around me without being controlling or pushy and I decided to simply let her take the lead so she can go at her own pace and reassure herself. (FYI: I didn't tell her all that, just decided to act accordingly)

But after a day of no contact from her I received a message telling me that she feels guilty of not being sure about me, not being able to give me more than cuddles, that I deserve someone that is 200% in.

Telling me she feels like she extorted cuddles and love from me that she doesn't deserve and that maybe, her interest in me only come from emotional deprivation. Therefore we probably not see each other again ... for now. I tried to reassure her and said ""ok you can take all the time you need and there is no need to put pressure on, we can go slow, just spend time together and see where it goes and it's ok if it doesn't go anywhere"".

We continued talking a bit via messages and she asked me out this weekend to drink a coffee and maybe find some time to watch a movie at her place or mine. I proposed to watch the movie on Sunday night to shire her up (because she's often sad on Sunday night), at her place (because she feels more comfortable there) and told her that there is no need for me to stay the night. I also said that if she prefers an other setting she's free to re-arrange it as it feels best for her. During Friday night we talk via messages and she seemed quite happy about our upcoming ""date"" sending me kissing emojis and all (wish is new).

That brings us today, we went for a coffee and it was cool we talk about fun and unimportant things but when she left she kind of canceled, our movie night telling me that she made other plans with a friends. It was totally ok with me, until later that day when she sent me a message telling me she doesn't want me to come on Sunday because I am ""too sensitive"" and she is ""too uncertain"".

Up until now I was confident that I'm good enough (even better than her ex's), that the uncertainty only comes from her traumas (and maybe the lack of ""butterfly's"" that comes from being around the kind of toxic, dangerous and exciting dudes she's usually attracted to). But now that I'm (slowly but surely) getting attached to her, I'm also having self doubts, thinking I not good enough. I feel like the dynamic has shifted, like I am the one chasing her, asking for her attention. And that maybe she's not that uncertain anymore but she just doesn't want to make a decision that may lead to loosing me.

l'm trying to play it by ear, take it easy, spend some time together and slowly learn to know each other instead of trying to define already what king for relationship we want but even if she said it's a good idea she keeps on bringing up her doubts about us.

At one point I'm tempted to take the lead and calm her uncertainty by ""guiding her"" showing her the way, but on the other hand Knowing what I know I don't want to push her like her previous boyfriends used to.

My question is : what should I do? Did someone experience something similar and can help me understand better what's going on and how to react accordingly ?",1,1729385314.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1g7n43v,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShuumatsuNoValkyrie/comments/1g7n43v/world_looks_bleak/,World looks bleak ,"Paris France 


The touch of snow blended fell through the Paris air like a fresh thin breeze covered the ground. It was the first of December and as everyone should know, Parisians love Christmas no matter the species.  If one were to visit during the time of Valhalla they would see snow that stretches the entire realm . The wings of angels often glow the hardest during the night sky while the children run around . Every inch you would see is nothing but Christmas lights that have  enough power to out last the sun. Walking on the sidewalk staring at the children playing around is a tomboy  named Grizz.She walked quietly, her face and body covered in multiple layers of clothing so nobody could see her . She wasn't in a rush to go anywhere but didn't want to slow down.  Grizz wore dandy gentlemen's clothing. A dark brown beanie hat wrapped on her dark red hair. The brown wooly scarf wrapped around her neck.  Randgriz boots shoved through the icy ground. Adorable Christmas music sung through the Paris streets . After living here for over 200 years Grizz was still in the shadows . 


She took out a small notebook with the melody  ringing into her ears. Humming pursed between her lips .  She sat in a random Cafe , “Sir  what would you like ? “ a waitress asked with a smile on her face . “Oh just black coffee, “ Randgriz mentioned while scrolling through her phone. The waitress took a deeper look at Randgriz.  “Are …are you Randy von Grizz …” her eyes widened. “Yes ..” Randgriz deepened her voice .”My 6 year old son loves your music ! Can I please get an autograph! “ the waitress asked . “Yes,  “ Grizz agreed, writing her signature  on her notepad . 


“Randy von Grizz “


But who was Randy von Grizz 


Grizz gave the waitress her autograph making the lady smile,  “Whatever you want is in the house ! “. “Ah thanks but I would just like a black coffee “ Randgriz waved her hand . “ Really?  Nothing else ? We have a Christmas special ! “ The waitress mentioned.  “No thank you ..” Grizz shook her head “I'm not exactly hungry “. At that moment her stomach can be heard growling.  “On second thought a slice of salmon wouldn't hurt..” Grizz told her . “Oh I'm sorry we don't have salmon today “ The waitress gave  her a menu . “Okay then I'll take a ham and cheese omelet with a side of gingerbread cookies “ Grizz gave out her order . The waitress wrote it all down then left.  Grizz went back to writing her notes , she has been really quiet for the last few decades living off the money she earned while she was alive, occasionally reliving the life she once had therefore she managed to male a small claim to fame in the afterlife. Grizz green eyes looked at the window.  The sunlight falling to sleep allows  the moon to take over nightshift.  The green and red lights brighten the sky along with parents in their silly costumes . A tear left her cheek as she could only imagine the feel of winter,  the feel of the Christmas spirit that most people have . 


That she will never have that Christmas spirit as those thoughts faded long ago . There is no Santa,  there are no elves and there is no magic, just broken dreams ..just fantasies things that weren't meant to exist for her . Grizz remembers all the times her parents locked her in the bedroom because she was an “embarrassment “ to everyone.  If anything she doesn't recall having a very enjoyable Christmas at all at any point in her life , Christmas is just a  cold reminder that she doesn't have any friends or family to have fun with . 


Suddenly her phone started beeping, revealing a text message. 


“Are you sure you're ready for this job ? “


The text messages from an unknown phone number asked.  


 Grizz -“Yes, I'm a little low on money and I need the job!  “ 


Unknown number - “I must warn you my son is very ..sensitive…20 nannies have quit the longest lasting a week . I expect nothing but the best !”


Grizz - trust me I've survive on that 


Unknown number- all expenses will be paid but you have until New years to empress me 


Grizz- I will not disappoint you Mrs Chopin 


And that Randy von Grizz fate is officially sealed

1g7n3fv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g7n3fv,"Wax/nonstop ?’s: prop, overwinter, dormancy, blooms (long post w/ TLDR)","Hi there! First time poster. I try my best to do my homework before posting question, forgive me if I scrolled past a helpful related sub! Also, I hope I chose the right tag! Begonia tax included as a token of gratitude for your time, expertise, and patience 💚

My goals:

To keep my beloved begonias as houseplants over winter, or at least save my nonstops

Some background info: 

I love flowering begonias, waxes and esp nonstops. (Btw I was never into nonflowering begonias but that might have to change cause WOW you guys have so many gorgeous ones — those polka dot ones are so cool!!) So most of what I know I learned from my aunt when I was a kid, the rest is self-taught. My aunt passed shortly before lockdowns, and gardening is my way to feel close to her. If only I wasn’t such a terrible child and paid more attention. The greatest currency is time, friends. (I didn’t come to make anyone cry, I swear!) I’ve done water propping for 2 yrs now, plenty of luck with vinca vine, waxes, ornamental sweet potato vines, coleus, geraniums, spider plants, and pothos. But not nonstops!! Most of my nonstop props rotted last winter, and the few that made it didn’t survive potting. I don’t have any nonstop props this year but lots of waxes which are doing well (see plant tax for wax momma and babies). Challenges bringing them inside include crappy windows (I do have a few grow bulbs), despotic cat overlords, and a toddler. Oh, and I’m in Zone 6a, my garden is either all shade or scorching sun. We’ve only been here 2 yrs so I’m still getting to know what my yard likes. 

Here’s what I know, or what I *think* I know (clarification would be lovely!):

Wax begonias are fibrous and therefore can be houseplants with proper light/heat because they don’t have a dormancy period. Nonstops are tuberous which do have a dormancy period where they develop a tuber that stores energy for the next season, making them annuals in 6a unless overwintered by lifting the tuber or by propagation. Wax and nonstops have male and female flowers. The females are the smaller ones with yellow squigglies in the middle and the weird pod-looking thingies on the back, and plucking those along with regular deadheading on nonstops produces bigger blooms (waxes are self cleaning and technically don’t require deadheading). Proper pruning of leggy stems and wonky leaves sticking out maintains bushiness and forces energy into producing more and fuller blooms. Nonstops bloom nonstop as long as it’s warm enough, hence the name (aunt fact). They can be forced to skip dormancy if kept above 80F (aunt fact). Common issues include rot, scorching, and legginess. Propping begonias in water is fine, water prop roots are weaker than soil prop roots bc water has no nutrients like soil and that’s why you pot when roots have roots. I think that’s about it off the top of my head. I’m curious to see how much of that is actually right! 

Questions:

1. Due to limited space, light, and kid/cat factor, for potted plants, is it possible to keep my wax props in water where they are safe (knock on wood) to pot in spring? (My non-begonia props were mostly successful this summer after waiting in water all winter)
2. A) How to overwinter tubers? B) Can I actually cheat the devil and force a nonstop to skip dormancy in order to keep inside over winter? Has anybody done it?
3. Odd one here… Have any of you ever seen a weird male (I think) bloom on a nonstop where it’s kind of smaller and the yellow thingy in the middle (not a female squiggly) is actually visible and prominent, about the size of a pencil eraser with teeny yellow petal-looking thingies. (Sorry for the crappy description and no photo, cant find one on google either). If you know what I’m talking about, what the heck is that, and what’s the plant doing it for? Once one pops up, I start to see more throughout the season even with pruning. 
4. Nonstop again: Why would blooms on a nonstop shrink? My ideas are temp change later in season, inadequate light, or overcrowded container (it’s my toxic trait, and yes, my coffee can planter is likely overcrowded lol). It’s later that I start seeing these weirdo blooms. 

I think that’s finally it. If you made it this far, you’re a saint and I hope all your begonias grow old with you. For everybody else, you’re also saints and here’s your TLDR.

TLDR: Nonstop and wax begonia enjoyer wondering how to better long-term water prop; how to overwinter nonstop tubers or if it’s possible to bring inside as houseplants by skipping dormancy; explanation of weird male blooms and shrinking blooms in nonstops.

First one came, no issues. The second one, was coming from Florida, and was taking a while to arrive. I figured this was because of the hurricanes. I receive a text saying my package is delayed due to an incorrect address and they send a link. Well, I ordered the other sticker and it arrived with no issues, so I'm a bit confused, but whatever. I follow the link. Then I get another text (from an email address) saying I have a USPS parcel being held at US customs that needs to be cleared due to an incorrect zip code. Again, I'm figuring this is because of the hurricane, so I follow the link, put in my card information and am told I'm charged an extra .30 to receive my package, and I'm okay with that, cause I want my package, what's an extra 30 cents. Big mistake.

I received no alerts about suspicious activity being used on my card. I normally only use it for small purchases, I barely ever buy online, I mostly just use my card for gas, food, coffee, small things. So during my lunch break yesterday, I go to my local gas station to buy coffee like I often do, and my card gets declined.

she's very strange as a dog because she doesn't like to play with toys or chew on things, but she really loves to chase other animals (playfully) and get loved on by people. 🩷 her eating habits are just as unique because she really doesn't seem to want ANY dog food, wet or dry, and prefers hand feeding. she honestly only wants cat food! 


it's not a specific cat food either - she's eaten sheba cat paté, temptations dry cat food, royal canin dry cat food, and tiki kitten dry food. and don't worry, we're not giving her cat food on purpose. it's more like my bf's mom absentmindedly leaves the cat food in places she can get to occasionally.


we've tried several brands of dog food for her: royal canin, blue wilderness, and most recently, tiki dog. she was fed pure boiled chicken and sometimes rice at another point. i also figured that she may want to eat in a quiet, secluded place such as under the bed or under a coffee table so that she feels safe. this has sort of worked, sort of not. 


my boyfriend's mom is at her wit's end. what advice do you guys have?",1,1729384447.0,DogAdvice,0,1.0,False

So I’m not well-versed in dietary science, so please bear with me.

I’m currently on a diet, and I’ve been drinking GamerSupps for around a year or so now. In terms of health and a balanced diet, would you count GamerSupps as “just water”?

I ask because people don’t usually count coffee or Diet Coke as “water”, despite the fact that both are majority water and only have flavouring mixed in. Whenever I think of GG, I mainly just see it as a flavouring and a nutritious powder that you can add to water. It basically just makes water better and keeps you alert.

So would you count it as a healthy beverage? Just water with added nutrients, or would you count it as an unhealthy drink vis-a-vis Diet Coke, which gets complained about a lot despite its negligible calories?",0,1729384006.0,gamersupps,3,0.33,False

40f. So I’m newly back on the dating scene. Been using the apps. I met a guy a few weeks ago, we had a lot in common and decent conversation. Met up for coffee and it was nice. He was really reserved and quiet, not like I’m used to. His texting was sparse but he was a little flirty and asked me to come watch a movie at his house for our second date. I agreed, and then I didn’t hear from him for a few days.

In the meantime, I had also been talking to a guy who really blew me out of the water. We had great chemistry and were talking on the phone every night. I really liked him and he asked me out on a second date the night after my date with guy #1.

Here’s where I messed up- I am on the autism spectrum so dating etiquette is foreign to me. I ended up cancelling the date with guy #1 out of “respect” for guy #2. 

STUPID I KNOW. 

Well not even 24 hours after I cancelled on guy #1, guy #2 went full blown psychotic episode on me and turns out he has some untreated mental health issues that I had no idea about. Really threw me for a loop- like full blown manic episode. So I obviously am like I’m not hanging out with this dude or ever speaking to him again. It was scary. 

Anyways- now I of course am beating myself up over this and regretting cancelling on guy #1. I’m not trying to play anyone I just really have a hard time focusing on people if I’m dating more than one at a time. Foolish mistake will never happen again.

Guy #1 and I have mutual friends I’m sure we’d eventually cross paths again or maybe not but now I’m like should I just text him and apologize? Something funny like “tail between my legs…”? Or is that not a good idea?

Does that make guy #1 feel like second choice? I just wasn’t sure if he was into me and (so I thought) had better chemistry with guy #2. In now realizing that guy 1 was just taking things at a normal, slow pace and I took that as disinterest. 

Not sure what to do- please don’t be mean to me I really didn’t mean to hurt anyone’s feelings and I’m not trying to “play” anyone. I just need help with dating etiquette because I’m so friggin lost. ",2,1729383395.0,datingoverforty,16,0.67,False

H: 5’10” SW: 242 GW: 190

I received my 3-month supply in the mail yesterday. I was going to do my dose later in the night, but I’m a bartender and I was going to be working the closing shift (clocking out at 4am) so I decided to take my dose before leaving for work (around 5pm). Starting at 8 units, which seems standard for their tpx. I was really nervous because of the amount of people on this thread who experienced nausea and fatigue. I worked my entire 9 hour shift and felt totally fine all night!
Day 2: I had social plans and was going to be walking around the city a lot. I was once again really nervous about feeling nauseous, and I’m surprised again that I felt fine all day today! 
My appetite definitely seems to be down because all I had was yogurt, coffee, and a croissant and it truly sustained me up until I got home! I’m really looking forward to the weeks to come and hoping to see some results soon! ",4,1729382940.0,HersWeightloss,0,1.0,False
1g7mdap,https://www.reddit.com/r/June2025Bumps/comments/1g7mdap/decaf_coffee_and_chemicals/,Decaf coffee and chemicals,"Since I tend to drink coffee (at least one a day) I know more that 200mg a day isn't considered safe. Recommendations are pretty mixed, and some research says even small amounts of caffeine can cause loss (I think this is also a point of debate due to correlation not implying causation) and behaviour changes to your baby (increased ADHD, etc). I dont know to what point this is true or not, but all research agrees your baby is not as equipped as you are to handle caffeine.

So I decided to go the 'safe' route and drink minimal amounts of coffee, which means switch to decaf for my morning coffee, and maybe allow myself a fancy cappuccino in a fancy coffee place if I'm really craving one, a couple times a week.

However , my research into decaf coffee showed that most decaf is extracted using potentially carcinogenic chemicals and is best avoided altogether! There is a third method of extracting caffeine called the Swiss water method that doesn't use chemical compounds, and is considered safe.

So I wanted to let anyone considering decaf know to check the extraction method, if avoiding chemical compounds when pregnant is a concern to you.

I am a college student and a working person, who's sleep schedule is rather tight (like 4-5 hours between school and work) and recently found out that I am no longer able to go whole week without sleep like I used to. 

By that I mean when I was in high school I pulled all 5 days with no sleep to catch up on studies. And died on the weekends of course. 

A year or so, I am unable to do that as I get screwed up after 2 days. Funny thing is that I don't even have time to eat properly (tight budget) and still somehow have energy to not sleep. I don't drink coffee, don't eat too much sugar so that can't be it.. And if I don't eat like almost at all, where the hell do I get the energy from?

Also, when I try to sleep, everything just bothers me. The way the sheets fold, small noises, lights flicking outside or even how I breathe. 

Can anyone try to tell me what is happening to me? I'm considering a visit to my doctor about this, because i already lost it a few times at work..

Picture this: I'm in class, and I ask my students what they want to achieve in life. It’s usually a mix of doctors, astronauts, and professional footballers. Throughout these discussions, the magical Italian verb *volere* always makes its appearance.

---

**The quirks of *volere***

Ah, the verb *volere*. It's like that quirky uncle who doesn’t quite fit the family mold. It’s **irregular**, and trying to fit it into a neat pattern is like herding cats. But once you unlock its secrets, it’s a treasure trove of expressions.

- **Desire:** Just like when Marta says, “*voglio* essere una maestra quando grande” and her smile lights up the room.
  
- **Strong will:** Think of Angelo, as determined as a mule, declaring his resolve: ""*voglio* smettere di fumare.""

- **Demands:** Ever had a friend like Giorgio, asking you for the tenner you borrowed last month? He’d say, ""*voglio* i soldi che mi devi.""

---

**Using *volere* in conditional form**

The conditional form of *volere* is a masterclass in manners. It's like whispering sugar plums into someone's ear.

- **Polite wishes:** Imagine saying ""*vorrei* imparare a suonare il pianoforte."" It’s not that you’re demanding; it’s just a gentle hope. 

- **Soft requests:** When at a café in Rome, saying ""*vorrei* un caffè, per favore"" works wonders—try it!

When have you found yourself using *volere*? Share your tales; I’m all ears (and coffee too, *vorrei* a cup right now).",1,1729382718.0,thinkinitalian,0,1.0,False

I spent nearly a decade in broadcasting, and part of that time I worked as a news reporter. I was mentored by a few people and had the opportunity to mentor a co-op student who eventually became an announcer at the station.

Basically, I think Mitchum sucked as a mentor, but I also think Rory could have taken some more initiative. We never saw Mitchum or anyone else give her writing assignments or critique her writing. All we really see her do is go on coffee runs, file and prepare for meetings. That indicates that expectations were not clearly set out right away. He could have encouraged her to speak up more without telling her she ""doesn't have it"" literally the first time he gave her feedback.

I do agree though that she should have tried pitching story ideas or offered to cover things, but him saying she doesn't have it so soon was a bit far. And I agree her reaction was terrible.",2,1729382664.0,GilmoreGirls,2,1.0,False

I read that it’s is a custom at events like sumo matches and kabuki plays and presumably other events where there is a performance to hand these out to staff when the event sells out.

Lovely custom but I still don’t fully get why these envelopes are used for so many sumo fan articles like coffee mugs and phone holders and loads of other things.

1g7m6sm,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/1g7m6sm/if_jesus_loves_everybody_then/,"If Jesus loves everybody, then . . . .","They tell me that Jesus loves everybody. If that is the case, then Jesus loves gays, lesbians, et al, and that means everybody who loves Jesus and claims to carry Jesus in their heart should befriend a non-heterosexual human. It also means they should celebrate their gay sons and lesbian granddaughters. They should also applaud their queer nieces and trans nephews.

Some may argue that Jesus loves you most especially if you are a heterosexual who believes in him as the divine leader of virtue and spirituality. This though is not unconditional love. Rather, it is love with plenty of strings attached. It is conditional love and not the unconditional love that Jesus supposedly personifies.

A quick internet search defines unconditional love as affection without limits or conditions. Therefore, assuming Jesus honestly personifies unconditional, then he would love conservatives and liberals as well as fence sitters, libertarians, environmentalists, aboriginals, socialists, communists, and even alleged devil worshippers. Jesus would also love atheists, agnostics, secularists, freethinkers, and all remaining non religious people. He would also love gays, straights, lesbians, queers, transgender, transsexual, et al human beings simply because they are human beings. He would love all humans because he is allegedly the pure embodiment of unconditional love who all humans without exception or equivocation.

With this in mind, people who purport to love Jesus should hug a freethinking atheist homosexual. They should invite a conservative lesbian secularist to coffee and buy a transgender agnostic socialist a lunch without endeavouring to convert or condemn them. In other words, they should love everybody without exception, excuses or equivocation.

Unfortunately, some people who claim to love Jesus and claim they have accepted him into their hearts are campaigning hard against non-heterosexual humans, some are campaigning against non Anglo people, and some are simply branding their compatriots as minions of the devil simply because they hearken to another pulpit.

And then they wonder why people like me are not impressed with their organization or why we have no desire to be party to their pious arrogance.

Talk some sense into me!,"I was Medellin for a friend’s birthday last week. My friend (the birthday boy) has a friend who has lived in Medellin for six years. We will call him “Jim.” Jim is doing very well. Nice home overlooking Medellin, Black girlfriend half his age (Jim is white, we are Black and younger than Jim. Jim was a basketball coach). We are at Jim’s home and he’s asking me about myself and my life in Manhattan NY. In short, from the conversation Jim and his girlfriend can see that I earn an above average income (over $300k, I’m a finance bro). We head to a club (VIP as to not be disturbed by the s*x workers) and the girlfriend has three friends join us. Over the course of the night I connect with one of the girls. It’s fun because her English is as bad as my Spanish. The entire night we only speak in the other person’s language. Neither of us drank much and we were having a great time. Here comes the rub. Jim walks over and says “she’ll come to your room for $200 USD.” I was so disappointed. Disappointed but I’m still a guy. I said ok. On the way to the hotel she is visibly troubled. I asked several times if everything is ok. She said “yes” but I didn’t believe her. What saved the night is my hotel. The WAKE does not allow guest unless you provide the name 24hrs in advance. She was not allowed up so I added her name for tomorrow. I called her an Uber and that was that. Next day she was willing to hangout but not at my hotel. I told her she was being difficult and to take care. My last full day in Medellin she reached out with a recommendation of a beach. I asked her if we could hangout. Late lunch, early dinner? She agreed. The day was fantastic. Laughing, connecting. She was holding my arm but asking for nothing. The restaurant Pranka or Pankha was trash. Nice atmosphere but food was meh. I asked her about the racism in Colombia. The things she said pissed me off. These people are peasants and dare to judge. A country only known for drugs, cartels, a criminal, whores and coffee yet they dare judge anyone! I said let’s go to Santa Fae mall, I need to buy some shoes. Once we arrived I took her shopping. I lied to say I needed to shop but my intent was to take her shopping. She’s poor. I could see the neighborhood where the Uber dropped her off and picked her up. I bought shoes, skirts, shirts, pants and other items until she said no more. I had the Uber drop me off first then take her home. At The Wake she had the Uber wait, got out crying, hugged me and kissed my cheek. She said don’t let the distance stop us from getting to know each other. 

Of course I sampled some of the local working girls (took them to my friends Airbnb) but I didn’t even kiss this woman and she is on my mind 24/7. So far we text everyday and send videos always sure to say the other person’s name to ensure it is not some shared video with 5 guys. I’m planning to go back in January for a week. Physically she is everything I look for (I try to only date Afro-Latinas). Nothing fake about her. At some point she will ask for money. That’s not an issue for me as ALL AMERICAN WOMEN want men with money and don’t hesitate to let it be known. I can’t get her off my mind but I’m not stupid. She may have 4 or 5 other guys lined up. Also she was coming up to my room the first night for paid s*x. Unhappy or not, she was going to come up. Believe it or not I would not have slept with her that night. I would have given her the $200 and said let’s sit in the jacuzzi on the terrace. Also I had a two bedroom. She could have slept in the other room or left if she had come up and been uncomfortable. I know there is no future as I am not moving to Colombia and not sponsoring anyone,  but I can’t stop thinking about her. She claims she is not a s*x worker LOL and said she would not have asked for money (only Jim mentioned money, she never did). She also points out she didn’t come see me the next day in my hotel. Who cares. 

So what am I asking from post? Clearly Jim’s girlfriend told her friends “there’s a rich Black American from NYC here. He dates Black women. Come get your Suga Daddy. If you have to f*ck on the first night to lock him in, do it. We (Black women) are not sought after here in Medellin. Do what you have to do.” Sorry so long but I needed to provide context. I think the play was make me think $200, let me smash for free so I think I’m special and she play the long game and open the money faucet. 

Any feedback is appreciated. She has cast a spell on me. Talk some sense into me!",0,1729381901.0,Passport_Bros,14,0.5,False

1g7lz0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/1g7lz0r/planning_to_do_a_solo_day_trip_tomorrow_to/,Planning to do a solo day trip tomorrow to Vancouver… ,"I posted in here before a few months back about doing one of these in Vancouver. 

Last time I got poutine at Costco in Richmond, parked my car at the skytrain / casino garage cause someone here mentioned it was $3 for the entire day and that Vancouver is easy to travel via skytrain and buses. I then checked out whatever that mall is that’s connected to the skytrain. I also rode a bike around Stanley park for a bit and I stopped at Peaked Pies which was amazing. 

Anyway, I like to every once in a while just drive somewhere for a solo day trip to just enjoy having some time to myself to recharge. I like Vancouver because while I’m in America I’m only 3 or so hours away by car. I thought about doing a train this time so I wouldn’t have to drive so much but the trains only go to Vancouver and from Vancouver a couple times a day so I wouldn’t have as much time to explore if I did that option so I guess I’ll just be driving up again and parking in the garage again and taking the skytrain and busses everywhere. 

It’s supposed to rain tomorrow according to the weather report but I live near Seattle so that doesn’t really bother me or make me not wanna go. But I’m just wondering what spots you think I should go to while I’m there tomorrow besides where I went last time. I’m pretty open to any suggestions. 

I would specifically like to ask for recommendations for a good coffee shop, good place to get ramen, and good places to go thrifting. Clothes thrifting specifically but I’m open to other thrifting ideas also. Preferably places that would be somewhat easy to get to via skytrain or bus. Obviously I’m willing to walk a little tho if it’s worth it. Also just any other suggestions on things I should do this time of year. 

Thanks everyone. ",1,1729381641.0,britishcolumbia,5,1.0,False

I'm not planning to like place a hot dutch oven directly from the oven onto the table top, but basically I do not want to worry about acid etching from lemon, wine, etc. or water stains from a wet glass of water left too long, or placing a hot cup of coffee directly on top.

I've done way too much research on this, and I feel like I've finally found some options:

Honestly I cook a lot and sometimes elaborate meals and I just want a dining table as durable as my countertops and not have to worry. I'd love to hear about the opinions on these options. I do have trivets for the really hot stuff, but I am not interested in things like placemats and tablecloths, I just want to be able to give it heavy wear as-is except for the hot pans directly on (which will not happen).",4,1729381525.0,BuyItForLife,5,0.84,False

Oh how I miss the feeling of being in love and being loved in the purest way. 

Life can be suprising and we'll just never know where will that special someone come from. So I'm hoping mine comes across this post. 


I'm a 5'7 chubby girlie from Pasay. Like really chubby, not malaman or little bilbil. Really chubby, so if it's not your thing, please move along. 

A little about me, I work at a call center, so I'm on nightshifts, so please understand that I'm not available at nights on weekdays. I like sponty out of town trips and a sucker for the beach. You'll usually find me at coffee shops journaling or just at home watching Netflix. Trying to go out more and explore new hobbies so maybe you can introduce me to yours.

So about you, please be taller than me (just my preference). Someone who's in to chubby and likes to go out or open to trying new things. For the age, I'm more on to guys older than me (+5) or if younger (-2). And let's be honest, someone cute. 

Hit me up so we can exchange pics. Please introduce yourself, Hi Hellos might not be entertained. If we've talked before, you're more than welcome to msg again. See u in my dms 😉 ",4,1729381418.0,PhR4Dating,0,0.83,False

1g7lw8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1g7lw8k/my28f_boyfriend32m_ignored_me_in_front_of_his/,My(28F) boyfriend(32M) ignored me in front of his friends and is telling me I need a less embarrassing job (I'm a nurse). Any advice?,"Just a little background: I (28F) have been dating my boyfriend (32M) for a little over two years. When we first started dating he was so sweet and charming, always took me to nice restaurants and said the nicest things to me, and we moved in together after a year. He does sweet things all the time, like sometimes packs my lunches for work or drives me to work (I'm a nurse at a hospital in the next town over), writes sweet little notes and puts them in my coat pocket, and he even has taken me shopping for nice clothes. 

There have been lots of times that he has said things that have hurt me a little bit, but we’ve always been really good at communicating and moving through it, at least I felt that way until one day last month. He had some friends in town visiting, and we had them over, went out to dinner with them, and went to a party with some of their mutual friends that I didn’t know, but I have always liked parties and meeting his friends so I was excited. I bought a new dress for the night that I really liked, and was feeling really good about myself when the night started, but as it went on, I started feeling worse and worse. My bf ignored me the whole night. He didn’t talk to me or look at me while we were out with everyone, and walked away to talk to other people at the party really quickly when we got there. When I went over to where he was, he still wouldn’t really look at me, and walked away from me as soon as someone started talking to me and I was distracted. A couple times I put my hand on his shoulder or his arm, and he did not acknowledge me once. By the end of the night I was mortified and embarrassed. I tried to talk and be friendly with his friends and the other people that were there, but it was hurting my feelings quite a bit. We ended up going home after all of his closer friends left and he FINALLY talked to me, but just to ask if I could call us an Uber. I did, we went home, and he fell asleep so quickly while I sat in the living room trying to convince myself that it was all in my head. 

The next day was worse though. I brought up that I felt like he had been ignoring me the whole night, and he  agreed with me and admitted me that he ignored me because he had been embarrassed by me when I told his friends where I went to college (a small liberal arts college in Nebraska) and that I was a nurse (he actually said ""just a nurse""). It hadn’t even been something that I would consider being embarrassed about, but he thought it was embarrassing because almost all of the other people at the party had gone to either Harvard, Stanford, or Brown, and were in business or tech. I think I was the only person out of the 30-40 there who hadn’t gone to one of those three schools (my boyfriend also went to Harvard). 

I told him that that really hurt my feelings, not only because I had felt like he had been ignoring me and that I was right, but because I thought it was ridiculous to be embarrassed about my job. I’m really proud of my job, and I love it because I feel like I’m making a difference. He then told me that he feels like my job is a dead end job and that jobs that you can’t really progress in are kind of a waste???

He then, for some reason, continued talking. He said that I could go back to school and be like the girls that were at the party. He said they had really impressive jobs and that I could too if I switched careers. I think this is absolutely ridiculous (and when I told my friends about it, they agreed). I always knew that I wanted to be a nurse, and I spent years going to school for it. I was proud of myself when I graduated, and after I started working at the hospital I work at now I found it really fulfilling, even if it is stressful sometimes. I told him I was really happy with my job and he said he didn’t believe me because I complain about it all the time, and he referenced when someone threw up on me once and I told him about it when I got home. At the time I didn't even really feel like I was complaining, but when I think back I probably was, so I admitted he had a point about the complaining, but that I still do love my job. I then said I didn’t feel like the other people there would look down on nursing as a bad job, and that some even said that it was a great job that must really make a difference in people’s lives. He said they were just being nice and they probably don’t really think that, which kind of further hurts my feelings because he knows the people there way better than I do, so he’s probably right when he says that. 

He continued, and told me that he had hooked up with a couple of the girls that were there before we started dating, and that was why he had been ignoring me when he talked to them. This also hurt my feelings. One of them went to Harvard and the other went to Brown. They are both in business, and they were also both really nice to me, and talked to me more than my boyfriend did. Actually, at some point in the night when my bf was ignoring me and talking to someone else with his back turned, I went looking for one of those girls and was able to join the conversation she was having. One of them even complimented my dress that night, but my boyfriend said she was also probably just trying to be nice (implying that she didn't mean it). 

After a couple days he sort of came to his senses, realized that I was actually not okay with what he said, and wrote me some really long apology texts, but when we talk about it, it still is clear that he feels embarrassed by my job, and that he is still very attracted to those two girls he hooked up with before (he used the words “very attracted to”). He has never really even talked about me that way (i.e. he doesn't tell me I'm beautiful, pretty, that he likes my outfit, etc. Sometimes he will actually criticize my outfits or the way I look or how my hair is done), which didn't bother me too much before, but after this conversation, it really does.

The same friends who threw that party invited us over to a halloween party next weekend, and I'm not feeling great about it now. My bf now says that he won't treat me the same way as he did last time, and that the only reason he did was because he drunk and made a mistake, but I find that difficult to accept since he acted that way the whole night, which was many hours long, and then gave reason after reason for why he felt like the way he acted made sense to him. 

I’m wondering what I should do, because I do love him, we talk about getting married all the time, we both want kids, and we already live together. I’m really close to his family too, I just went and got coffee with his mom the other week. Another part of me is worried because this whole situation is kind of changing the way I see all of the past things he said that have hurt me that I have forgiven him for. They were always about my job, the way I looked, or dressed, or talked, or about what college I went to. Every time he says something wrong, he apologizes, but then explains why he said it, and looking back it almost feels like he's minimizing the issue and refusing to take accountability. I’m also usually not insecure, I’m really proud of the college and nursing school I went to, I met some of my best friends there, and I feel like I dress well and am attractive. But now I’m feeling bad about all of it and I think it’s because I’m actually realizing what my boyfriend thinks of me, and it kind of kills me to think he thinks so little of me. I told him this and he says that’s not true and he thinks so highly of me, but I’m just not sure how to move past this feeling. 

He is my best friend, and I can't understand how he can say all of this and not see how it's hurting me. He keeps saying he doesn't understand why I'm reacting like this, while I honestly think I'm being very calm about it all. I don't know if I am blowing this out of proportion. I’m honestly feeling pretty bad about myself, and am still embarrassed by how he treated me in front of his friends (and exes). I think what I really want is a way to make him see that what he is saying and doing is hurting me, and that how impressive I am to his friends shouldn’t be a factor in how he treats me. When we aren’t in front of people, he is usually pretty amazing and kind, with the occasional slip up (that we have always worked through) but this belittling behavior is becoming more frequent and I don’t know how to make him stop, or how to deal with how it makes me feel when he does it. I would usually talk to my best friends about this, but they are telling me to leave him and move out. I see some of their points, but I really do love him and want to make it work. Also not sure about attending the halloween party next weekend. I'm seriously considering backing out and having him go alone. 

Has anyone dealt with a similar situation before? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

tl;dr my bf ignored me in front of his harvard friends (and some exes) because I'm a nurse and he says it's an embarrassing, dead end job. Then he doubled down and said that I should get a new one. I obviously won't do that, but I want to make it work and I want him to stop hurting my feelings and belittling me. Feeling like backing out of a halloween party with the same people next week. ",13,1729381396.0,relationship_advice,84,0.81,False

1g7lvar,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1g7lvar/i_think_im_egoistical_give_me_a_reality_check/,"I think I'm egoistical, give me a reality check please.","I'm feeling really emotional over a situation that’s caused some tension between me and my boyfriend. Here’s some context: my birthday is coming up in a few weeks, and I usually don’t do anything special for it. I don’t like the attention, and while I appreciate the effort, I get a bit annoyed when I receive gifts I didn’t ask for, especially when I’ve made it clear that I’d prefer nothing if people aren’t sure what to get me.

Another important piece of context is my family dynamic. We don’t really celebrate birthdays, and our relationship is somewhat strained. My father was physically abusive to my brother and verbally abusive to all of us. Things have improved over the years, but neither my brother nor I like him much, though we tolerate him because he's family. My brother has ADHD, and I’m fairly certain my mother is also neurodivergent. Our family is deeply flawed, but I appreciate that we’re straightforward with each other. If we don’t want to do something, we say so.

On the other hand, my boyfriend’s family is extremely outgoing. While I like and appreciate them, they’re very different from what I’m used to. They meet up regularly, sometimes weekly, just to talk, and I find it a bit overwhelming. My family knows I have autism and ADHD (AuDHD), though my parents don’t fully understand the labels. Still, we have an unspoken understanding. My boyfriend’s family, however, doesn't know about my mental health struggles, as my boyfriend thinks they wouldn’t really understand, and I agree with him.

For a while, I’ve been avoiding bringing my family and my boyfriend’s family together because they’re just so different, and frankly, my family isn’t interested in these kinds of meetups. However, my mother and my boyfriend’s mother ran into each other by chance, and since his mom is so outgoing, she suggested a parent meet-up for my birthday. Neither my mom nor I declined because we didn’t want to hurt her feelings.

A day was set for the parents to meet, and while I wasn’t thrilled about it, I didn’t object. Then my boyfriend mentioned that his sister was hurt that she wasn’t invited, so now she, her boyfriend, and his grandmother are coming too. The gathering is supposed to be a typical coffee and cake meet-up, which is something my family has never done.

I asked my brother if he and his girlfriend wanted to come, but, as I expected, he found the idea awkward and declined. I was disappointed, but I understand. My mom suggested we could meet with my brother after my boyfriend’s family leaves, so it wouldn’t be as stressful. But when I mentioned this to my boyfriend, he said it would hurt his parents’ feelings. So now we’re meeting my brother on a different day.

The whole situation is frustrating. I get that my boyfriend’s family might feel hurt, but it’s my birthday, and no one asked me what I wanted. I didn’t want this gathering in the first place, and now I’m stuck organizing everything, which is stressing me out. I feel like I’m overreacting and being childish, but I’m still mad and don't know how to get out of this. It's also kind of hard for me to understand why they would be hurt, I mean I logically can understand it but in another way I don't??

I think I’m projecting some of this frustration onto my boyfriend. I’m angry that I have to hide my disdain for the situation in front of his family. Maybe I’m being entitled, but I’m also upset that I’m expected to go along with something I don’t want just to make his family happy. My boyfriend said I should just go through with it to keep them happy since they help us out with things, but I don’t see how this is related. It’s not like I asked for their help, and now I feel like I owe them something. Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for their help but I also wouldn't have died without it. It's also not like I wouldn't help them with anything, I would gladly help them if they need help to balance it out. 

It's also not like my boyfriend tries to help me. We made the compromise, that I don't open the presents in front of everyone. But I also feel like he doesn't get how stressful all of this is to me, there is a reason why I never celebrate my birthday. I also don't understand why now suddenly the sister/sister boyfriend and grandma are coming too?!

This whole situation has made me realize how much I have to suppress my true feelings to make them happy, and that really bothers me. My boyfriend is surprised by how I’m acting because I’m usually empathetic, but right now I’m confused and angry. I can't even really verbalize what's bothering me specifically. I know I’m probably being an entitled asshole, but I can’t seem to stop feeling this way.
I'm pretty sure you're going to tell my I'm the asshole, but I don't know how to cope with these feelings. ",3,1729381315.0,AuDHDWomen,1,1.0,False

I see her about once every two weeks to once every week. Well, I decided I had better ask her out soon.



Well, I go to her cashier line, and I am wearing a coffee shop shirt (lets call it coffee shop X) and she asks if I work there. I say no, as I do not, and then ask her if she has been to Coffee shop Y, my favorite one in two. She says no. Then I leave shortly. One week later, I am again in her line and I basically ask if I can have her wants to go to Coffee shop Y with me and if I can have her number. She says she cannot give her number out at work, and I say next time I see her I will give her a card with my number on it. Then she says ""don't worry we'll go to coffee shop Y together"" and I say ok. Then the next week I see her again at the cashier, but I am still shopping and shortly afterwards see her talking to the store supervisor. She is talking to him for like 10 minutes, and I finally leave. I end up coming again later that evening and see her restocking shelves. I ask how she is doing, and I get the paper with my number out of my pocket and give it to her. I tell her to text me tonight when she is off of work. I wanted to say more, but she had her hands full of things and I was kind of embarrassed, because there were like three TJ's employees right by her that she was working with kind of watching what was happening. Then I say sorry I need to get going, and I leave soon after that. She may have tried to say something but I don't know. Well, it has been almost 24 hours and still no reply. Based on things I have noticed (I am very good at discernment), I thought she possibly liked me, but I don't know. She is an introvert and shy as well. I am wondering if this means she rejected me (if she didn't write back). I am thinking of going up to her next time I see her and asking her if she ever wrote to me, or if she just wants to be friends and not date. Should I do one of these?

What step of action should I take? I am really attracted to her.

1g7lr4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueNarcissisticAbuse/comments/1g7lr4x/i_left_a_narcissistic_sociopath_friend/,I left a narcissistic sociopath friend,"At first he seemed amiable, kind of goofy and charming, he was interested in me and said we had similar interests (in the end, he was pretending to get me hooked).

I think now that all is said and done he was a narcissistic sociopath.

He spoke with no inflection, unless he felt slighted or angry. 

He was expressionless, unless someone was praising him or giving him sympathy, then he’d grin creepily for a looong time.

His laugh was a high cackle like an unhinged disney villain.

He didn’t blink. He’d stare at people in a fixed way when listening to them, and his eyes were lifeless.

He thought he was amazing and wanted praise from everyone he met one minute, or had a sob story the next. He just sucked the air from a room but people stuck to him like barnacles. He was obsessed with power.

After he’d established I was a likeable person & target, he’d run into me all over the neighbourhood way too many times to be coincidence. It was at the start and I wish I’d listened to how weird that felt. Seeing him always made me feel startled/high anxiety.

He enjoyed seeing people, particularly women and children, uncomfortable. He flirted with me inappropriately multiple times despite me saying I didn’t like it, and did to other women too. He laughed when kids hurt themselves and got mad when they were playing because they didn’t ‘shut up’.

He took care of dogs for people to look helpful/charitable but never pet them or gave praise/affection. He laughed when his childhood dog nearly drowned.

He said he had to ‘forgive himself’ for things he’d done to his younger brother as a kid, and that someone was going to find out something ‘terrible’ about him one day.

He always tested my boundaries and if I was jealous of how many female friends he had (I wasn’t).

He held more and more contempt for my intelligence, goals, opinions, and personality as time went on and wasn’t afraid to be belittling towards me.

He invalidated and dismissed my emotions, always having a worse experience in his life.

He had no empathy for anyone. He liked disturbing media & books, things that included violence, assault against women, genocide, just horrific stuff that most of us struggle to sit through. He said he ‘enjoyed the challenge’.

He gave me the silent treatment for reasons I’ve never been able to figure out because he didn’t discuss them. He’d just start avoiding me, cancelling plans, and not texting for months only to slink back in pretending nothing had happened. 

He was extremely sensitive to criticism and if he felt slighted he’d become moody, petulant, dismissive, or ignore you.

He liked to gossip about me across the room with his triangulated friends, then laugh at me for initiating a simple greeting, just to keep me on edge I guess.

His physical touch and hugs were cold AF. Just lifeless. No hello or goodbye expression on his face, just a limp ‘hey’ or ‘thanks for the company’ and an anemic hug. It was like touching a robot.

He began stalking past my house once the love bomb had ended. He did this 5 times throughout the friendship, usually a week out from when he had planned to meet me or was about to text me to see me.

*Once he stalked past on the night after we’d met up which felt extra creepy because it was so soon, and that day I’d overheard his family loudly talking about how I was ‘the girl going out with him’. He had not mentioned his family was visiting when we’d met up, nor had he talked to me about a change in his feelings towards me. He treated me like a possession by assuming more than friendship & telling his family a lie. I felt disturbed and looking back I consider this the beginning of the end.

He always had a female friend he seemed to idolize, but a different one every few months. He loved to categorize women into types.

He freely admitted to a past of cheating on exams, sneaking away during school trips, taking drugs & drink, neglecting friends & partners for weeks - just really antisocial stuff.

He had no ability to plan for the future. He was in his 30s and unable to finish a uni degree, unable to hold a job for long before moving on due to a lack of ‘balance’, and was always unsure of what he wanted. He had no goals. His favourite word was ‘maybe’. 

His ex girlfriends were all problematic in some way. If they wanted to live together, or would demand some kind of effort from him they’d go on his enemy list and he’d shut off. In speaking about them he was critical and had no self awareness of his part.

He was cheap with others and a spender with himself. Could barely buy me a coffee without being given profuse gratitude, but would buy himself records, clothes, plane tickets, trips away and brag about it. He had no fiscal or general sense of responsibility.

He never apologized for how much he ignored me and played me around. He was hyper focussed on things going his way. If they didn’t he’d get snippy and disappear. I existed in a low priority out of sight out of mind place for him.

He was afraid of other men. I surmised from his talk about them he had a difficult father and was a mamma’s boy. He had an unnatural attachment & admiration for her. He wanted all the women in his life to nurture him, yet resented it too.

He had to be the authority on everything and would negate your experience over & over until you doubted yourself. Once he tried to lecture me on what being a woman was like. Bro.

Thinking about meeting him began to feel like dread. I look back with a sense of shame I didn’t see the signs sooner. Luckily though I was able to slowly & safely back off once I realized.

When he saw I saw through him and I’d made myself as unavailable & boring as possible without confrontation, he moved on to a woman he hadn’t been able to shut up about throughout the final months of our friendship. She accommodated all his needs, was an ultimate cool girl, had money. Good luck to her.

If you made it to the end of this, thank you. I had to itemize it all because it felt so jarring and confusing at the time. He embodied a version of evil I never want to meet again. What do you think I was dealing with?

Part 16: The second day at Azur Lane.,"This Series is sister to ""Steel Valkyries"", which technically takes place before the events of ""Siren Thesis"", all within a cluster of branches where the Sirens have decided to undertake inland incursions.

Summary:

After their dinner at the Iris dorm, Doctor bethencourt and Song get ready to get onto their planned activities. For Commander Anderson, this means bringing people he can trust to ascertain how good or useful these new findings are.

[Previous part](https://www.reddit.com/r/Azurlanefanfics/comments/1g2uh4o/siren_thesis_part_153_the_third_encounter/) - 

////

The rest of the dinner at the Iris Dorm went the same way many other official dinners usually went like. The rest of the dishes were served, some small talk occurred regarding the dinner, some more talk now about personal relationships, a bit more talk about professional work. Then, thankfully to break out of that, some really great desserts were offered, at this point Song finally understood why Le Malin would go out of her lazy ways in order to come to a somewhat stuffy formal dinner, the desserts that Dunkerque made were at least worth 2 formal dinner events, 2.3 if she were to be more precise on the matter, and only if she wasn’t the person who would have to be the focus of all the talking taking place.

For that particular dinner the Doctor took the brunt of it, answering several questions as well as dialing up the charm, putting up the whole “social butterfly” act up. She had been truly grateful for that, otherwise she would face the risk of her food getting cold, with a plethora of questions being thrown her way rather than more meaningful things, like ice cream or a good puzzle.

Things had ended up in a calm note, just some more talk about the likely schedule for the next day, which was some more tests performed by Vestal, that much Song was certain would happen regardless of anything else that could be in the agenda, after all, she really had no official registration under any nation nor had she had any sort of official medical record. So far Vestal seemed to be the serious and caring kind, as such, Song estimated that she would spend the first few days trying to establish a specialized medical record, rather than performing all the tests that would bring light to Song’s true nature as well as her capabilities. Which in reality, was something that suited her just fine.

The room offered by Richelieu, within the Iris dorms, was rather comfortable. To Song it was a big surprise that the “nostalgia for home” part of her trip took place when she realized that the room was much more comfortable than what she was used to. Bigger, brighter, better furnished and a whole plethora of things that Song would never let Doctor Bethencourt forget. It was plain comical that with the power of creation at hand, the man had decided to go for minimalistic and functional décor.

 

The next morning, regardless of them being in a whole different place much different than her room at the Doctor’s facility, went by much in the same way as any other day at their facility much to her own surprise. Song was aware that the doctor was a passionate man of discipline and habits, but she didn’t think he would go as far as to continue his habits even in completely foreign places, such as Azur Lane. And for better or worse, that included the things he did for her as well.

As such, her day started pretty much the same it did every day, with the Doctor waking her up, helping her change to her comfortable day clothes, which now included a hair accessory, gifted by Richelieu. The Doctor dedicated a few minutes to having her do light stretches, being a firm believer that it was the very least one could do to keep a healthy body for a healthy mind, “Even when swamped with work, some lightening up the stress on the joints will do wonders for your day” as he was wont to say.

Their morning routine would always continue with the doctor brushing her hair while she would do some puzzles or mental exercises, small things like sudokus, word puzzles, and then some rounds of various mind games on an outdated handheld console that the Doctor simply adored. The thing was likely decades old. The new battery that had replaced at some point the original one needed a rigged custom setup and specialized hardware just to avoid firmware issues, restrictive firmware placed by the same company that abandoned the console after a few years of barely dedicated service, and a plethora of other issues. But the Doctor had the right of it, the thing had a charm of its own, and the games were simple yet properly aimed towards specific core aspects of the mind’s performance, such as memory, math, reflexes and judgmental capabilities, as such it was an acceptable part of her morning routines.

The Doctor was still going over her hair, even though she had somewhat short hair that barely reached her shoulders, the doctor would always dedicate much more time than necessary, probably because he was used to handling much longer hair. That always bothered her a little bit, an annoying weight on her chest, due to something that was completely out of her control and in which she had taken no part at all. As such, she decided she would rather focus on her mental exercises, or the Doctor would soon notice she had her thoughts elsewhere.

Her myriads of thoughts and calculations came to a halt when there was a knock on their door.

“ *Doctor? Miss Song?* ” Came a voice on the other side of the door, after the gently rapping on it

*“<Yes, we are here!>”* The Doctor gently patted Song on her head, as a manner of saying he was going to check on the door.

The doctor made his way to the door, he opened it and engaged into some small conversation with whoever was on the other side, it only took him a few moments to do a “good morning greet” and dispatch the person that had come.

“ *<It was miss Algerie, seems like Doctor Vestal came to check on you before breakfast>.* ” He told Song once he had closed the door.

As per usual whenever they were on their own, they would speak in Irisean, the Doctor’s native language. Song greatly enjoyed those private conversations, those felt like they were disconnected from their usual businesses and chores at their home, more intimate and familial.

“ *<Uh? Should we be concerned about that?>* ” Song asked, turning off the handheld device and gently putting it back onto the protective case the Doctor had for it.

“ *<Well, that depends, do you still dislike needles?>* ” He asked, wiggling his eyebrows and smirking at her.

“ *<Ugh, I could certainly do without… So, what is that about? Came to give me some shots before we could even get some food?>* ” Song pouted, the idea of becoming some guinea pig so early in the morning was not her definition of ideal.

“ *<We will see, she probably wants to get some blood tests done while you haven’t eaten anything yet, those need to be done under an empty stomach>* ” The Doctor shrugged his shoulders as he said that, putting up a brown light jacket and picking Song’s sandals, bringing those to her.

“ *<If it comes to something you don’t want to do, we can always say no.>* ”

In response, Song raised an eyebrow at the Doctor, that response seemed too easygoing and carefree for him and his usual scheming.

“ *<What am I missing? There’s something else you have foreseen>* ” Song accused him, her brows now knitted together as she was trying to figure out where would the Doctor’s mischieful fun come from.

*“<Are you familiar with the procedures to measure blood sugar levels?>* ” The doctor wiggled his eyebrows playfully.

“ *<Wha?- with my blood?! Does she plan to take a blood sample?>* ”

“ *<I’m certain we will find out soon enough>* ”

“Ugh…” Song groaned, throwing her head back against the comfortable chair, her legs waggling with ease as the chair was a bit too high for her size, paddling almost as if she was trying to shake the sense of queasiness by doing such a motion.

*What’s the point of being a living embodiment of a core concept of humanity if it involves so many bloody needles?*

*“<Are you ready, my little duckling? I think I hear her out of the door already, so I am sure she really wants to get it done before breakfast>* ” The Doctor said.

“ *<Ugh… of course it would be before I get the opportunity to get a bite of anything>* ”

 

“Ah! *Docteur* Vestal! such a pleasure to be able to meet you again, first thing in the morning!” Doctor said, dialing up the charm again.

“Good morning to you too, Doctor Bethencourt” Vestal greeted back with a minute bow of her head.

“And good morning to you too, Song” Vestal then greeted Song, which seemed much more animated and genuine, compared to her professional words towards the Doctor

“I hope I’m not intruding too much, but I thought it would be better to get blood samples for the general tests done as soon as possible, since those need to be done with at least 6 hours of fasting as a standard. Since good food is easy to come by at the base, I usually take a more aggressive approach to this” Vestal explained, while at the same losing no time and taking some of the necessary things to get started with the procedure.

Song winced at that, the doctor had simply patted her on the back, so it was entirely her call on which action to take and weigh the possibilities. Which given the personality of the Doctor, it meant that regardless of whatever she might decide, it didn’t really affect their plans.

Nevertheless, there was a certain merit in performing a blood test knowing it would be performed by a Kansen military doctor, she most likely had a wider database to compare her blood sample and probably a much more health oriented mentally when it came to the tests done. Back at her facility they had databases to compare her blood against, but given the sort of people involved and their mentalities, she was inclined to believe they were more likely able to find the genomes involved into enhancing intellect, or wisdom cube sensitivity, than to be able to tell her if she had dangerously high sugar levels, or if she had any common illness to be concerned about.

Which was another intriguing point, there could be sicknesses unique to Kansen, it would be negligent to believe there weren’t any. Yet all the information that the Doctor and Song had been able to review, either in databases available at the facility, or within the Network, those didn’t make mention of any. They had discussed this before, and had concluded that, there were in fact none in existence, which was highly unlikely, or that all sorts of Kansen’s medical records were safeguarded and given only to those that did require the knowledge. Such as a Kansen doctor.

Song sighed at that. It was obvious she had much more to gain from having her blood analyzed than from avoiding the queasiness of the experience.

“Ok, I agree. But can you make it the least painful possible?”

“I promise I will try my best” Vestal answered honestly “I have some experience when dealing with Kansen’s unique bodies, so at the very least I won’t stab a needle at you blindly.”

“Now, please take a seat and I’ll proceed to make it as quick as possible so you can have your breakfast.”

 

With the blood sample over, Song could only hold the piece of cotton to her arm and glare at Doctor Bethencourt who purposefully looked in other directions, evidently trying to avoid meeting her eyes. The thing that Song had learned from the brief procedure was that apparently everyone within her facility was mediocre at medical needlework. Her experience with Vestal had been enlightening, the work had been swift, aside from the uneasiness from seeing her blood being taken, there was nothing to it but a little pinprick that amounted to the same amount of pain as a pinch on her arm.

She was now certain that she would personally see onto training some decent medical staff once they were back home.

Vestal had accompanied them to have breakfast, she had been quickly invited to stay, and even though she had originally gently refused the invitation, she was soon found by Suffren’s sister, Foch, who had insisted on her staying. Apparently, she had originally intended to wait for them to finish their breakfast in order to get the first of another two smaller samples of blood, only a droplet according to her, to be able to establish sugar levels as well as how fast Song would process them.

It made sense, perfect sense in fact, to establish a control sample, then one after the food and a second one after a predetermined amount of time, which would be taken after she had undergone various other medical tests that had been left “for later” the day prior. Song could see how it all made sense and used her time efficiently. She didn’t like it one bit, much less the part about stabbing her fingertips with a needle, but it made sense to her.

--

Doctor Bethencourt had left Song in Vestal’s hands, after all, most of the tests could be done without his assistance at all. Plus, he was certain that he had pushed Vestal enough that she preferred to do things without his presence and that suited him just fine.

Also, there were other things for him to do, as such he asked Dunkerque who had once again assisted them on their meal, to help him contact the commander. After all, he did bring various kinds of experimental pilotable Siren-based vehicles as well as weaponry, he was sure that would be enough to keep him and everyone else occupied for at least a full day.

At some point, Zuikaku had arrived again in order to continue accompanying Song, he welcomed her and invited her to join breakfast. Just as he expected, she seemed somewhat torn about the invitation, as Vestal seemed to be ready to leave without her, the doctor gave her an easy way out, letting her know that she would be much more useful escorting Song than staying with him. She actually thanked him and left along with Song and Vestal.

Once they left, he found himself alone for a while at least, until Dunkerque came to check on him and ask him if he had enjoyed the food.

He sincerely thanked Dunkerque for their breakfast, regardless of his personal life choices, or his views on many things, he could certainly appreciate a balanced warm hearty meal as a day starter as well as perfectly made Irisian bread, which Dunkerque brought to the level in which it could be considered an art form. He invited Dunkerque to take a seat and accompany him while he waited for the response of Azur Lane’s commander. He was certain the commander would send someone for him, one way or another. As such, he decided he could use some good company and maybe make some more small talk about their home nation over a cup of coffee.

 

He really didn’t wait too long, within perhaps ten minutes two Kansen that he had yet to meet made their way inside of the Iris dorms, finding him at the table in which he was currently drinking coffee with Dunkerque. They introduced themselves briefly and professionally, which made the doctor certain that the two of them were playing the part of inner military police as well as escorts. Chapayev from the northern parliament, and Pennsylvania from the Eagle union, both wearing uniforms and colors that looked the part for said countries’ military branches, if maybe with reproachable levels of liberties on how they wore them. He invited them to take a seat and chat for a little while, which seemed to tempt them to a certain degree, but they also had their orders and they intended to keep their word true to the commander. Which was a response that the Doctor had expected.

He thanked Dunkerque again for the meal as well as the company. He honestly enjoyed the brief talk, and he felt he had to make it clear.

Within minutes they found themselves in a military car making their way to the safety warehouses by the port, where everything he had brought from his facility had been placed at. He had been requested by the commander to bring “a little bit of everything he was willing to demonstrate to them” and the Doctor was happy to oblige on that matter.

Much to his astonishment, he had been truthfully surprised when he reached the warehouse. He had found the main specialized workforce of Azur Lane, the bulins, ready to assist with moving cargo much bigger and heavier than themselves. Then again, the Doctor stopped to think properly on that specific train of ideas, that specific wording was wrong, since perhaps only Song and maybe some of the submarine girls would be smaller than the bulins, as such about anything they would carry was bigger and likely also heavier than them.

The little girls were the apparent equivalent of a competent if goofy mechanic and a super powerful tugboat all in one, taking only two of them to lift about anything in the warehouse, mostly just to keep whatever was being carried stable between the two bulins as a safety measure, since they seemed to be able to carry about anything by themselves. The Doctor was able to actually see such an example when he entered the warehouse, with two bulins carrying a shipping container, which required one on each side, evidently if only to maintain the huge container parallel to the ground. As such, it was within just a few minutes that the diminutive mechanic crew had arranged all the equipment that the Doctor had told them to pick onto trucks, even the metal containers with the siren ground drone replicas. Once everything was loaded onto the vehicles a couple of bulins got onto the trucks as well, likely in order to help unload all of the cargo once they had reached their destination.

--

The commander had arranged everything for the moment when Doctor Bethencourt would be ready, thus, when the Doctor had decided to call him the very next morning, in order to showcase the equipment he had brought, the commander only required to make a couple of calls, inform Helena that they would be doing the tests on the things Doctor Bethencourt had, and left Saratoga in charge of his office for the time being. He had somehow finished up all the paperwork that the Union aircraft carrier had given him as punishment, so he was able to count with her whole support, for the time being, until he managed to accomplish something deemed too foolish or too risky for his station.

With Helena alongside him, they both got into a military service vehicle and headed to one of the various locations they used for various tests within the base. A location that had enough flat ground, for various purposes, as well as being close enough to the sea, which was the barest base requirements for any sort of tests ever done in Azur Lane. The trip almost didn’t register to him, while Helena drove the car, he was too busy making one call after another to those within his inner circle. Even if he had plans ready to take into action which only needed so much as a push from him, he would rather still make the personal calls for those that he trusted and needed by his side.

They arrived before anyone else, which was to be expected, he took advantage of whatever free time he had managed to create to help Helena set up a command post, which for this consisted mostly of just a few desks, some chairs, a couple laptops and an whiteboard, the barebones for whatever could take place, for now at least, once Akashi and a few of the girls from the research lab arrived they would surely bring with them all manner of gadgets they would use to measure and observe the results, in reality his job was to observe and give pause to what was to take place on these tests.

They had barely managed to finish installing the whole base arrangement when they heard more vehicles arrive. Heading out of the tent to greet the new arrivals, the commander was glad to see he had the right of it, with a couple more vehicles arriving and parking right beside the one he had come in. In a blur of movement the passenger of the vehicles came out, rather than coming to salute him all of them started moving various container boxes and devices, setting them by the commanding tent, a cacophony of orders being said to some of the bulins that had came out of the vehicles, as well as some of the human personnel from Azur Lane, as soon as various orders had been given and the two Kansen in charge had made sure things were properly understood, then they made their way to greet the commander.

“Comrade commander!” Soobrazitelny cheerfully greeted. “It’s such a great thing to be called by you to try out new findings! Personally, I prefer to do the tinkering, but new discoveries must always be peer reviewed!” The northern Kansen said with her usual excitedness about science.

“Heya, Commander!” Next came Da Vinci with a clipboard on her arm “I agree! I prefer to create new tools and devices, but it is exciting to be able to examine a whole new discovery!”

“I am glad to see you here. Would it be safe to assume that Yuubari and Chkalov will remain at the lab?”

“Yes, comrade. They wanted to prepare things in case Song arrived early. Unlikely, yet there are many things they can work on while they wait” Soobrazitelny said while nodding twice.

“The two of you didn’t just dump everything on them to make your way here?” Commander Anderson was barely able to contain a smile from showing on his face, knowing full well the sort of shenanigans the more intense Kansen could get up to.

“Commander! You wound me! We won fair and square a lucky draw none of us had any way to manipulate, just to be here” Da Vinci exclaimed with obvious pretended pain on her face. Which lasted a whole second until her excitement got the best of her.

“So, what are we looking at here Commander? You mentioned Siren-like hardware, but the official report was elusive at best.” Da Vinci asked, practically bounding in place.

“That’s because that’s not the final version of the official highly classified report, that no one should have been able to read yet.” Anderson raised an eyebrow as he looked at Da Vinci.

“Comrade, there shouldn’t be secrets between friends! We are only helping each other here by making things easier for everyone!” Soobrazitelny had quickly jumped in, her arm around the commander’s shoulders and her countenance the same as if they were simply sharing stories over drinks.

The commander rolled his eyes internally at that, it meant there was a breach of security to his computer that even BT had not found, which was something he could address at this moment given that the main culprits were likely in front of him. But then again, he felt that he would rather have all his personnel working at their best and focused on what was to come, as such, reprimands and official punishments could wait. Chapayev and her Happy Polar Penitentiary were not going anywhere, after all.

“There are many things I could barely believe when I saw them, and in all honesty, I would prefer if you came with an open mind for this.” He cleared his throat as he prepared his next words, which were truly heartfelt “I need your honest opinion on what you will see. What we saw at that facility were things that if true, could change the course of the war, and perhaps not only this war, but all wars to come too. As such, I would rather tell you as little as possible and have your professional view on things”

At some point during his explanation the commander had looked at Da Vinci as well, which in turn had read the mood and had gotten closer to her researcher comrade, both of them taking the full seriousness of the commander’s words, nodding in turn and feeling like there shouldn’t be anything else to add to that, they nodded knowingly and went back to setting up the equipment that the rest of the personnel was moving from the vehicles.

 

They hadn’t quite finished the equipment arrangements when more vehicles arrived. On the first one, the commander could see Pennsylvania at the wheel, which meant that truck was the one escorting doctor Bethencourt. On another one, a truck for transporting materials and goods, he could see Akashi on the passenger seat, which meant that that particular vehicle had to have the most intriguing equipment they would be testing, the commander could always put the figurative money on Akashi being the one closest to anything that could be monetized in some way. The vehicles transporting people had stationed close to the one he had been in, while the truck had been put in front of the command tent, Akashi being the first to come out with one of the visiting Valkyrie coming right behind her.

“Commander this is so great, we get new things to experiment with and new friends to help us too, \~nya!”

Akashi said that last part while signaling to the Valkyrie who had come along with her, Buggy, the red-haired leader of the small group of Valkyries that had joined them on the mission to oversee Doctor Bethencourt’s facility.

“Ah! Good morning, Commander Anderson” The Valkyrie saluted to him and stood in place for a while.

She had stood that way with everyone looking at her, at that moment the commander recalled that the Valkyries that had come with them seemed to be rather stiff when it came to usual military conduct.

“At ease, Buggy” He said, crossing his arms, thoughtful “Has anyone given you any sort of trouble about rank or conduct?”

“Eh?! N-no, Commander!” The redhead replied, seemingly about to salute again.

“Mm? ok, then. Please remember, you are a guest and a friend here. Albeit we might ask for your assistance on certain things, it will be more in accordance to asking for a favor, rather than an order.” He informed the redhead, her brows now knit together as she seemed to be chewing on those words.

The commander was hopeful that their Valkyrie guests could feel comfortable enough before they left the base, he wasn’t completely sure if all Valkyries were so inclined to follow strict military protocol during a mission, and he really hope they just behaved more freely when in their own time. He wasn’t an expert on how the official Valkit branch worked, but he knew from firsthand experience that the Kansen would go above and beyond, and even accomplish feats that were considered impossible, as long as they had a fair work-life balance. They had much more intense personalities than most people and any unbalance or concern in their lives seemed to also weight them much more intensely.

The rest of the people had by now gotten out of the vehicles and assembled by the portable command post, the commander took a good long look at everyone present to weight their options and what could be done and what needed to be explained.",1,1729381008.0,Azurlanefanfics,0,1.0,False

out of the blue they told me they aren’t ready for a relationship and never were. they swore on a dead relative id done nothing wrong. said i’d made them the happiest they’d been since they’d been a kid (which was a very unhappy time for them due to a lot of trauma, and also i was their longest relationship and the only one to ‘ever treat them right’). 

they kept emphasising that they didn’t want to hurt me like this but also was scared of losing me so wanted me as a friend. this was 2 weeks ago and we agreed to no contact for a bit.

since then, their mum reached out asking if when i’m ready we’d meet for a coffee (she didn’t agree with him). they posted on social media him with his mates in our old common date night spots. posted things i’d already liked. posted songs i said i liked. posting posts almost identical to mine. viewing any of my messages in mutual groupchats instantly. their best and only friend messaged me asking if i’m okay then told me how my ex was without me asking (said they’re fine but need time to ‘do them’).

today, i have been informed they are back in contact with their old fling who they made fun of during our relationship saying they were embarrassed by them as this old fling was obsessed with them. this old fling would constantly try to talk to them whilst we were together. commenting on their old flings post.

i have muted their social media and removed them from my private accounts as this hurt me. my friend also removed them from the mutual groupchat we have. have they really moved on so quickly? am i doing the right thing by ignoring their posts here onwards?

1g7lo5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g7lo5z/the_kodiak_island_incident/,the kodiak island incident,"Kodiak Island, Alaska, USA—a quiet, friendly, and welcoming place for tourists. But for people like me? Living on Kodiak Island is like living on the edge every day. The only thing I have to document my experiences on this island is this dusty old Goodwill Chromebook I just bought after my five-day trip to Missouri. Now, I can record everything that happens on this deadly soil. I’ve lived here for maybe seven years, and I have a lot of stories, but I’ll share them in a different post. For now, I just want to document everything that happens here.

I don’t know how much longer I can stay here. I haven’t felt safe on this island for years, but last night—it was something else. Something I can’t explain, something that still has my hands shaking. I need to write this down while it’s fresh, before the fear swallows the details.

It started just before sundown, around 5 p.m. I was sitting by the window, drinking coffee, staring out at the treeline like I always do. There’s something about those trees that’s never felt right, like they’re hiding secrets, things I’m not supposed to see. But last night, I did see something.

At first, I thought it was just my mind playing tricks on me—light fading, shadows stretching, maybe a bear moving between the trees. We get those all the time. But this wasn’t a bear. No, it was too tall. Way too tall. And its fur wasn’t dark; it was this sickly, pale white that seemed to glow against the dimming sky. I told myself it was nothing, just fog catching the last of the light, but deep down, I knew better. I could feel it. Something was watching me.

I leaned closer to the window, squinting into the dusk, hoping I was wrong. That’s when it moved. Not like an animal—there was no hesitation, no fear. It moved deliberately, like it wanted me to see it. It stepped out from behind the trees, and I swear, my heart stopped. It stood on two legs, towering, its body covered in long, matted fur that clung to its skin in clumps. Its face—god, I don’t even know how to describe it. Like a bird, but wrong. So wrong. Its eyes... they were fixed on me, unblinking, like it could see straight into my soul.

I froze. I’ve faced some dangerous things on this island—bears, storms, the isolation—but nothing like this. My mind screamed at me to run, to hide, but I couldn’t move. I was trapped in its gaze, as if I’d been swallowed by the cold air outside. It didn’t move toward me, didn’t growl or make any sound. It just stood there, watching, its eyes never leaving mine.

I don’t know what came over me, but I grabbed a handful of rocks from the porch and threw them as hard as I could. I don’t know why. What did I think a few rocks would do against something like that? They hit the ground near its feet, but it didn’t even flinch. It just... raised its hand. And that’s when I saw it.

Thick, purple liquid oozed from its fingers, dripping onto the ground with this low, sickening hiss. The smell hit me like a punch to the gut—putrid, rotting, like something long dead. My stomach churned, and I nearly gagged. But I couldn’t look away. I was locked in this silent, awful exchange, just me and that thing.

And then it did something I’ll never forget. It smiled. Not a normal smile. Its beak, or whatever you want to call it, curled unnaturally, as if it knew exactly how terrified I was. I could feel my skin crawl, the hair on the back of my neck standing straight up. Every instinct screamed at me to run, to get inside, but my feet were glued to the ground, my heart slamming against my ribs.

I don’t know how long we stood there, me frozen, it dripping that awful liquid, but suddenly I snapped out of it. I don’t even remember turning, but I found myself sprinting back into the house, slamming the door shut so hard the walls shook. I locked every window, every door, double-checked the locks—my hands trembling so bad I could barely manage it.

I looked at the clock. It was 5:08. I had only been outside for a couple of minutes, but it felt like an eternity. My heart was racing, my mind spinning with questions I didn’t want the answers to.

I didn’t sleep much after that. How could I? Every time I closed my eyes, I saw its face, those eyes, that smile. I stayed up until exhaustion took me, and when I finally woke up this morning... the window was open. And smeared across my door, in thick, dripping streaks, was that same purple liquid. The smell still lingers in the air.

It’s watching me. I know it is.

I can’t shake the feeling that something’s coming for me. Last night was bad enough with that pale, bird-like thing at the treeline, but what I saw today? It’s on a whole other level. And the worst part? I didn’t even see all of it. Just enough to know I’m in deep, deep trouble.

It started around 4:30 p.m. I was still trying to convince myself that maybe the creature from last night was just some strange animal, maybe a trick of the light, but deep down, I knew better. It’s been seven years on this island, and things have always been... off. But today, it was different. Much worse.

I heard it before I saw it. A dragging, scraping sound coming from the woods, slow and deliberate, like something was pulling itself through the dirt. It was louder than anything I’d heard out here before—heavier. I didn’t want to check. I should’ve stayed inside, but I couldn’t stop myself. My curiosity got the better of me. I needed to know what it was. I grabbed my flashlight and stepped outside, already feeling the chill in the air, like the island was warning me to stay put.

The woods were darker than they should’ve been. Clouds had rolled in, and everything felt... wrong. Still, I walked closer to the treeline, sweeping my flashlight over the underbrush, searching for movement. That’s when I saw it—scales. Huge, shiny, black scales, catching the last bit of light from the dying sun.

I froze. Whatever those scales belonged to, it was big. Really big. I could hear it moving, slow and deliberate, but I couldn’t see all of it. Just the shifting glint of scales as they disappeared behind trees, as if the creature was staying just out of view on purpose.

My flashlight flickered, and for a second, I thought I’d lose it completely, but then the light stabilized—and that’s when I saw **them**. Two eyes, staring at me from just beyond the trees.

They weren’t like any animal’s eyes I’ve ever seen. They were too large, glowing faintly in the darkness, like embers in a dying fire. Deep yellow, with a strange intelligence behind them. They didn’t blink, didn’t shift away. Just locked on me. Watching. Waiting.

The rest of the creature—its body, its face—was hidden in the shadows. I could only make out the shape of its head, broad and looming, but it was like the darkness clung to it, like it didn’t want to be seen. But those eyes—they burned through the black, pinning me where I stood.

I felt this wave of nausea hit me, like its gaze alone was enough to make me sick. I didn’t understand how, but I knew, deep down, that this thing wasn’t just watching me. It was sizing me up. I could feel its focus on me, almost like it was trying to decide if I was worth the trouble. My heart was pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears. I couldn’t look away.

It didn’t move closer, not yet. But I could see its scales shifting again, just beyond the reach of my flashlight, massive and smooth, catching the dim light like polished stone. The way it moved was almost hypnotic, slow and deliberate, like it knew it didn’t need to rush. It was in control.

Then, it let out this low, rumbling sound, like a growl, but deeper. I could feel it in my bones, vibrating through the ground beneath my feet. The trees shuddered around me, leaves falling like a soft rain. The sound wasn’t loud, but it was enough to make the hair on the back of my neck stand on end.

I took a step back, my legs shaking, the beam of my flashlight wobbling. That’s when I saw it—just the briefest glimpse of its face. Not the whole thing, not even enough to describe, but just a flash as it shifted in the shadows. It had a face, alright. I’m sure of it. But what I saw... it was wrong. It was too smooth, too sleek, like it wasn’t finished, or like it was wearing a mask. And its mouth—god, I only caught a second of it, but it was enough. The way its jaw hung open, too wide, like it could swallow me whole in one bite.

I stumbled back toward the house, nearly tripping over my own feet. I couldn’t keep my eyes off the creature, even though the darkness was swallowing it whole again. Those eyes, though. They never left me. They glowed faintly, like embers, burning into me even as I backed away.

Just before I slammed the door behind me, I heard it again—the scraping sound. Louder this time, closer. Whatever it was, it wasn’t in a hurry. It didn’t need to be. It knew where I was. It wasn’t hunting like an animal. No, this thing was patient. It knew I’d come out again eventually.

Once inside, I locked the door, though I know it won’t make a difference. If it wanted to get in, it could. Easy. I’ve been pacing ever since, trying to figure out what I saw. I can’t shake those eyes, those terrible, yellow eyes, watching me from the shadows. I didn’t even see its full form, and that’s what scares me the most. I saw just a fraction of it—a glimpse—and it was enough to make me sick with fear.

What happens when it decides to show the rest of itself?

I think that pale creature from last night was just a warning, a test. But this? This is different. This one feels like the real threat. And I don’t know how long I have before it decides to come back.

Missouri feels like another planet right now. I would give anything to be back there, where the only things watching you are the stars. But here... here it feels like the island itself is alive, like the trees and the ground and the sky are all in on some terrible secret.

And I’m stuck right in the middle of it

Seriously though, at least half of the k-cups I buy have damaged/compromised packaging as shown on the right of the photo. The coffee brewed with pods that have that loose, deflated top always taste awful to me. At best, it tastes stale. At worst, it tastes like sawdust and dirt.

Other than opening every box on the grocery store shelf until I find one with k-cups that are intact, or going through the hassle of returning every other box for a replacement that will likely be defective as well, I don't know how to avoid this.

1g7lll7,https://www.reddit.com/r/hospice/comments/1g7lll7/guidance_and_thoughts/,Guidance and Thoughts,"I found this sub on accident when I was scrounging the internet for any information and was so thankful for the people who made long posts about their journey. I want to give back for anyone else going through this same experience.

To give a little context, my mom was dx with stage 4 metastatic melanoma and stage 3 lung cancer back in April 2024. They weren't sure which one had metastasized or what had triggered it. A few years prior, her doctor had found a spot on her lung, but it wasn't growing so they were just watching it. Of course that was the spot that manifested into cancer. There was some concerns that her RA medication had triggered it, but it's still unknown. 

In 2019, my stepdad (her partner of 18 years) had congestive heart failure and a week after he came home from the hospital, she went to the store to get him something and he had died of a heart attack. She tried CPR, but it was too late. After that, in 2021, she came to live with me. In 2023, my childhood cat of 18 years had passed away from metastatic lung cancer, although we hadn't known it until it was too late. Both times, I wasn't present - I had just seen my stepdad and teased him about his hair, and I was out of country when my cat had to be put down. I had promised my mom she wouldn't be alone when she died because of those experiences. 

My mom didn't tell any of us kids that her cancer was incurable, but my aunt knew. She was at the first oncologist appt, I was just at the following ones. She had texted me last week telling me that my mom was dying and that I should be there more and make sure she had a dignified death. I broke down crying, spent that whole Thursday crying, and on Friday, talked to my mom and apologized for everything I felt guilty about. I told her I didn't have anyone outside of her, that I loved her, and missed her and felt like I ran out of time to give her all the nice things I wanted. She said, ""You did a good job. We all just try to do what we can with the time we have."" And then she hugged me and cuddled me, but she didn't cry. She told me that she was going to quit the chemo infusions because they made her too sick and affected her quality of life too much. That was my sign that she had known all along that she was dying. 

Last Sunday, a week after her second round of chemo/immunotherapy and only 2 days after I had that talk with her, she had a stroke. She had just been talking to my partner only 20 minutes before and I was still in bed. She cried out his name and he rushed downstairs to find her collapsed on the floor. I woke up from hearing his panicked voice and when I saw her unable to move her arm, I immediately called 911. The last thing she said to me was, ""Can you get my cats inside?"" before she became nonverbal. 

She was taken to a trauma room where they said they found tumors all over her brain, which had caused the stroke. My mom had been having headaches for a month until then, but we thought it was just a side effect of the chemo. She ended up in ICU for a day and half. She wasn't verbal, but she could still understand and was able to communicate by raising her arm. An oncologist said we could give her radiation to her brain, but she'd feel nauseous and it might affect her memory. I asked my mom if she wanted that and she raised her hand ""no."" The other options were to put her on a feeding tube and do invasive surgeries. She said ""no"" to all of those, as well. We opted to put her on comfort care, so she was moved to a comfort care unit. 

The first full day she was in the comfort care unit, the doctors got me and my brothers together and explained that she would only have days to live. They didn't foresee her having even a week left. We asked my mom if she wanted to go home and she raised her hand ""yes."" We asked her if she wanted to go back to my house and the answer was ""yes,"" so we immediately got ready to discharge her on home hospice. Altogether, she was only in the hospital for 3 days. Everything happened very fast. 

As soon as my mom got back to my house, she seemed utterly at peace. She got to pet her cats and say goodbye to them. Up until the night she was at the house, she was very cognizant of us. As soon as she saw me walk in the room, she would lift her arm and pull me into a tight hug. She dragged me into her hospital bed to cuddle her. She would do a lopsided grin at a joke or huff out a laugh. She declined fast when she got home and we all knew she had been holding on just to get there. 

She had already begun to have Cheynes Stokes breathing. On Tuesday, it was 8-second pauses between breaths and a respiratory rate of 10ish breaths per minute. At 6 pm on Wednesday when she was at home, it was at 15-second pauses with a respiratory rate of 5-7 breaths per minute. When awake, she had begun to make this groaning/choking/gagging sound while breathing that started to turn into a hoarse breathing when asleep (not quite death rattle yet). I called the nurse line to make sure that was normal and they said she was ""imminent"" and cautioned that she might pass during the night. 

She developed intense terminal agitation around 10 that night. I called the nurse line again and they had me do 20 mg of morphine, 10 mg of lorazepam, and 20 mg of haloperidol since the minimum amount wasn't enough. It was an hour until my mom started to settle. She was constantly wanting to remove her clothes and be naked, she would roll over onto her chest and made me worry she was going to suffocate herself. My brother eventually calmed her by laying next to her and cuddling. She kept wanting to cuddle, dragging us into the bed with her and then shoving at us to get away to strip all the covers and clothes off her. She still recognized us, would still make eye contact, but you could tell she was sad. Throughout all of this, especially at the hospital, you could tell when she was crying on the inside. Her mouth would clench and she would shake like she was crying. It broke my heart. 

She would go through phases of sleeping and then waking up extremely agitated. On the third round of agitation, it was 6:15 am on Thursday and I went to check on her. Her feet were ice cold, her hands were hot. She was staring up at the ceiling, glassy eyed with her mouth agape. It was terrifying. I called out to her and her head moved, but her eyes stayed fixed on the spot. I called out to her again and she finally made eye contact. I told her, ""It's okay, I'm right here. You're not alone."" She looked at me, and then after that, her eyes were half-lidded. It was like she had just disappeared. 

I didn't feel like her symptoms were being managed well enough by my brother and I, and I was worried she was uncomfortable. I kept looking all over the internet for a timeline and everything pointed to her being close to the end. I called the hospice line again and at 9 am, the hospice nurse came and we decided to transfer her to the hospice facility. They helped make her comfortable, sat her up and gave her medication for the drive there. Her breathing had developed more of a rattle by then. 

At 11 am, she was transferred to the hospice facility that was, like the hospital, only a mile away. They cleaned her up, applied cream to her bottom where it was red, tucked her into her blankets that I brought with her from home, and made sure she was cozy. The nurse there told me that she thought she'd only have hours to live. I stayed with her until 1ish when my brother arrived to go get coffee and changed. When I got back, it was around 2 and in that short time I was gone, she had begun to develop the death rattle. A half hour later, white foam began to come up from her throat. My brother ran from the room, he thought she had died by then. 

I'll admit, I didn't want to be there once the death rattle started. I started panicking and hyperventilating, I prayed for courage to stay in the room. I had promised I would be here for her last breath and wouldn't leave her alone. It was such a horrifying sound and it scared me. 

My mom had wanted me to go to college for music, for singing, so I sang to her for awhile before putting on some calming music on my phone. My aunt arrived around 2:45-3 pm. The nurses came in and sponged her mouth and gave her more morphine, turned her on her side to be more comfortable. After they left, I crawled into the bed behind her and curled up to rest against her. 

At 5ish, the nurses came back in and turned her on her other side so she was facing me. No more rattling, but a crackling sound now. Her lower jaw moved every time she took a breath. They were shallow, gasping breaths like a fish out of water. The chaplain came around 5:40 to give her last rites. By that time, my uncle was there. 

Between 6-6:50, me, my aunt, and uncle sat reminiscing about my mom, my grandpa, and memories. The nurse gave her a last bit of morphine around 6:45. Neither of my brothers could be in the room. It was too hard for them. At 6:50, my brother texted us saying there was a full moon. I texted back ""That's a good omen."" And then, I told my aunt thank you for texting me last week. I said, ""I'm really glad that I got the chance to talk to my mom, to tell her everything that I've been thinking so I wouldn't have any regrets. If you hadn't texted me, I wouldn't have been able to tell her all the things I needed to say to her."" Just as my aunt was saying that she had regrets when my grandpa died, my mom's eyes slid open and then she took her last breath. 

Losing your mom at 30 brings on an unholy level of ""what-ifs,"" regrets, guilts, and thoughts than if I had lost her in my 40s or 50s. She didn't get to see me get married or publish a book or have kids. She was there for the other successes, like graduating college and buying my first house, but I knew she wanted to see me in my wedding dress (she saw it, at least, after I bought it). Outside of 3 years, I've lived with my mom my whole life and even those 3 years I missed her so much. I've never not had her around. I've always taken care of her, I was there the other 2 times she was in the hospital and now I feel so empty, having nobody to take care of and care for me in return. 

I've been living in my own personal hell for the past week, but the hospice team helped me immensely those last 2 days and this sub helped so much in understanding what was happening with my mom. The hospice nurse put it very aptly when I chose to transfer her to the hospice facility: ""People think that bringing someone home will be that Hallmark movie moment - you bring them home, you hold their hand, and then they pass away, but it's not always like that."" Death was nothing like I thought it was and I was wholly unprepared for it. Ironically, much of the things that happened to my cat happened to my mom. The loss of mobility, the glassy eyes, the breathing - it was the only reason I knew I should be counting respiratory rates and pauses. Cancer acts disgustingly similar regardless of your species. 

I hope that my story helps someone out there make sense of what's happening to their loved one, like the many stories on here helped me when I was sitting in my room at 3 am.",1,1729380550.0,hospice,0,1.0,False

My partner is leaving her job as it has become insufferable for her mental health. She has been signed off for a month and in that month is activily looking for a replacement. If she cannot find a replacement after that month she is planning to hand her her notice in. I am trying to prepare for the worst case scenario and would appreciaite some insight into what we are doing.

I am ""assuming"" that we may go a few months without any income from her side (which is unlikely but again, pays to be prepared for the worse case). I want her to get better and take time if she needs it.

Here is some data on the worst case situation

My income: £2770 (up to £2850 from Dec)

Credit card debt: £800 (no interest for 14 months).  
Emergency fund: £1450

Essential expenses (mortgage, bills etc): £1950  
Weekly spend (food, travel, ongoing dental costs and coffee 2-3x a week to get us out of the house and socialising for mental health): £35 a day, so £1085. This is a pessimistac take, based on a weekly Tesco shop, my commute and an added 20% for ""other"".

This gives a total outgoing of £3035 which is a £265 deficit each month. We can use the emergency to bridge this gap? I suppose this is what it is for.

This would allow us to live for a good few months (6ish) if we NEEDED to (which is excessive).  
The real bummer is no savings, no paying off crdit card debt and chipping away at the emergency fund.

Would other people approach this in a similar way?

1g7llca,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1g7llca/ive_created_this_to_help_all_sibo_sufferers/,"I’ve created this to help all Sibo Sufferers, predominantly hydrogen dominant.","

When you have any kind of Sibo the small intestines unfortunately suffers greatly. Abdominal bloating after a meal is for many people one of the worst symptoms. Pain arising from Sibo, whether it be diffuse central abdomen/lower right abdominal/right hip flexor/right shoulder pain are usually a massive warning sign from you’re body for help. 
Different muscles groups in the body end up picking up the slack and overcompensating for the underlying inflammed/distended digestive tracked.
You’d be surprised the amount of people that urgently get sent to hospital with suspected appendicitis due to lower right abnormal pain which in fact is actually due to a dysfunctional/inflammated illecocal valve. 

*However there are plenty of things you can do to help yourself to get relief & cure yourself and stay Sibo free.

#1. LowFodmap diet will help you to avoid fermentable problematic foods (This should only be temporary) Apps on mobile/books available. There are other diets i.e carnivore, however this can be extreme and hard to follow for some. When it comes to eliminating certain foods everyone is different, but just know that Sibo and food intolerances overlap, but both collerate to ones individual gut microbiome. 

#2. Consume organic raw cabbage juice 250ml one or two times daily that you juice yourself. It’s loaded with intestinal healing compounds. Taste wise it’s initially like drinking plain water but at the back end you get a cabbage aftertaste. It doesn’t store well in the fridge and any milk will become tainted so juicing daily is recommended. marshmallow root is also a good gut healer.

#3. Get a GI map done at a lab so you know in-depth you own gut flora, then you know what is in excess, what’s missing etc. A GI map will also highlight any possible parasites and if they are found carrying out a parasite cleanse will help. This can be done ideally with herbals but also pharmaceutically.

#4. Research culturing your own homemade bacterial yogurts specific to your own needs. Plenty of studies have shown this to be hugely powerful at treating Sibo without the need for pharmaceutical antibiotics. It’s proven to cure hydrogen Sibo patients with 90% efficacy. 

#5. Don’t snack between meals and try and have a five hour cut off period between eating and going to sleep. Eat slow and chew each mouthful forty times before swallowing. Make mealtimes as stress free as possible. Don’t eat until full, leave room within the stomach with each meal. Try and get enough sleep and listen to your body when it needs more rest. Try and stick to a circadian rhythm, both sunsets and sun rises are equally marvellous. 

#6. Most people jump straight to antibiotics or herbs to treat Sibo, however I believe it’s important to heal the intestinal junctions and make some valuable life changes first. Sibo is a major cause of leaky gut so this is just simple common sense. Sodium Butyrate A short chain fatty acid & Phosphatidycholine which helps regenerate new cell division. Both amazing!

#7. Mega dose vitamin B1 thaimine TTFD or Benfotaimine specifically (start slow and increase over time) a starting dose of (50mg building up to 100mg) along with a good quality B complex. It’s important to also take a magnesium/potassium & selenium/molybdenum to support. Hydrogen Sibo is predominantly lose stools so vitamin deficiency’s are almost guaranteed. That being said replacing extra lost fluid and replenishing electrolytes is important. You may find a massive improvement in symptoms just from these steps alone. Always aim for best quality Liposomal vitamins. No fillers and no unnecessary junk.

8#. The vagus nerve plays a major role so having weekly saunas, swimming sessions, Vitamin D&K from the sun/supplementation, massages, breathing exercises and supplementing CDP Choline. Yoga and dance are both beneficial for the digestive tract/the brain gut connection. Stress management is crucial! Find ways to reduce stress and make life changes if necessary. This can be work related changes if stressful, emotional stress is top of the stress pyramid so be mindful of toxic relationships with friends/lovers/family and adjust accordingly. REDUCING STRESS SHOUlD BE YOUR NO.1 GOAL!!! Ultimately make time to relax the mind body and spirit. Being at one with nature whether that’s locally or in a holiday environment is so beneficial. Touch the tree, walk along the beach, swim in the lake, put your hands in the mud… all good for stress reduction, calming the mind and stimulation of one’s  microbiome. Try and surround yourself with positive people and partake in healthy activities with them ideally in a group. This next one is a contentious issue and although I’d never condone tobacco smoking, many indigenous tribes have smoked tobacco for hundreds of years to elevate health conditions. My thinking is that raw nicotine stimulates the vagus nerve which in turn can bring mild relief from some gastrointestinal disorders. I know countless Sibo sufferers that have made the personal decision to take up vaping nicotine and have reported life changing relief specifically from the extreme fatigue & brain fog symptoms of Sibo. However nicotine is highly addictive and I personally do not advocate it, but felt it only right to share my findings in a non judgmental way. I have also heard reports of orally micro dosing pure THC oil having a positive impact on the vagus nerve and the entire cerebral central nervous system, bringing balance and creating kind of a calming effect and much needed reset. However this again is known to be mildly both mentally and physically habit forming. 

9#. Killing off the Hydrogen bacteria, you can use pharmaceutical Rifaximin (Two week course) or take oregano oil in a teaspoon of olive oil however this needs to be (4weeks) Just be aware that both methods cause ‘Die off’ and can make you feel worse initially. Nobody wants to develop Sifo or Candida off the back of trying to eliminate hydrogen/methane Sibo, taking a high quality Turmeric Curcumin 95% can reduce this chance. If you are suffering IMO or methane Sibo be mindful that the antibiotic ‘Neomycin’ comes with higher risks especially if you already suffer from tinnitus which in some cases can not only make it worse but irreversibley worse. It’s a black list antibiotic for a reason so familiarise yourself with the possible risks. Also supplemental NAC N-Acetyl-Cysteine for its biofilm busting properties/activated charcoal will also help rid the bad bacteria. It’s worth noting that there are plenty of herbs to treat Sibo which have been found to be equally effective at treating this disorder. However I’d caution using more than two specific anti microbials at one time. And remember four weeks, no missed doses, correct dosages are essential! Elemental liquid diets are very effective at staving the bacteria, however it’s worth noting that some people find they lose a significant amount of weight from carrying out this diet. Which for those that can’t afford to lose such weight over a short two weeks it might not be ideal. It can also be just as difficult as doing a strict carnivore diet, which has also been shown in clinical trials to be effective at treating Sibo if done for minimum two weeks with no deviation. In both these diets the bacteria lay dormant, cease to multiply and within time die off and are then expelled.

10#. Figure out why you developed Sibo in the first place. This for many is the hardest. The vast majority can be traced back to a food poisoning event. Check that you are producing enough stomach acid with the baking soda water test. If it’s low, supplementation with a little lemon juice or apple cider vinegar in water before meals to stimulate your own acid production. I do not recommend supplementing with Betaine HCL with regards to specific hydrogen Sibo or hydrogen dominate until you have eliminated most if no all the bacteria or done a negative breath test. Digestive bitters can also help with low stomach acid. Check that your gallbladder is working correctly. Light coloured stools along with undigested food are a sign of both low stomach acid and bile issues. 
A product called ‘beets flow’ can help bile flow normally again likewise coffee enimas & colonic water irrigations carried out by a clinician. Check that the illeococel valve isn’t dysfunctional. A lot of intestinal bloating stems from this muscle becoming weak and not opening and closing as it should. Most people suffer for many years with Sibo and normally the dysfunctional valve is most often a symptom not a direct cause. But regardless you want it back working as its intended. There are YouTube videos relating to self help massages to help strengthen this muscle. Remember swimming works every muscle group. Like previously mentioned, the vagus nerve is a key component. 

11#. Once in remission it’s very important to add the right probiotics in quickly and consistently (Natural foods n drinks are best) kimchi, sauerkraut, Kiefer etc. Most importantly you want to make sure you have a small intestinal composition that includeds - Lactobacillus Reuteri, Lactobacillus Gasseri, Bacillus Subtillus, Bacillus coagulans. These are target specific to prevent relapsing. If you don’t the bacteria that wasn’t eradicated from the large intestine will migrate back up into the small intestine and run a muck unchallenged in turn causing a relapse in symptoms if left unchecked. 

12#. Don’t be mad with general medical doctors, because the vast majority just learn off outdated textbooks which unfortunately have been influenced by cash hungry big pharma. Just know that some poor Sibo patients have to endure endoscopys/colonoscopys, numerous blood tests, fecal tests, numerous hospital and GP visits all to be told when alls said and done that there’s nothing obviously wrong and in turn General Practitioners suspect neurological issues and offer lifelong prescriptions of amitrptyline because of an outdated Australian study with regards to it relieving neuropathic pain and IBS (again outdated umbrella term) symptoms in some cases. Amitriptyline is a powerful Tricyclic antidepressant which can be very difficult to discontinue with severe discontinuation syndrome and there are now also a long term usage link associated with dementia.
Even the general doctors that do have a slight understanding of Sibo or the microbiome won’t go off script out of fear of being struck off. Just know this is an epidemic of huge magnitude that’s currently flying under the radar as it were, not effecting thousands of people, it’s millions of people worldwide. That’s not to say their aren’t great functional & neuropathy doctors out there that are compassionate and willing to help for a small fee. However unfortunately some choose to try and profoundly profit off of the back of  other people’s misery and they will ask for an extortionately high fee to help. Important Quote “If you are not your own doctor you are a fool” 
– HIPPOCRATES 

13#. Research the microbiome it’s fascinating! To think that each persons gut microbiome flora is individual to us and goes all the way back to birth and not only that but how and where we were born, all the choices we make throughout our lives and the knock on effects is mind blowing. fundamentally it’s still very Misunderstood medically and you could draw a comparisons to the vast oceans us as humans have yet to fully explore, yes we’ve mapped it but we haven’t explored the majority of it. Dr David Williams ‘Super Gut’ is a great first book to read. 

*** Most importantly*** Avoid processed foods!! Think of a takeaway or a processed meal as a cheat meal meal on a Friday night with family & friends, but the rest of the week you eat clean. Avoid seed oils, limit sugar consumption, wide array of fruits again in moderation, Wash all fruit n vegetables, Eat organic as much a possible, gluten if you can tolerate it in moderation, carbohydrate percentage have to be balanced with healthy fats & proteins, drink plenty of fluid daily, drink more warm water as opposed to ice cold water from the fridge…The Chinese have been doing this for centuries as they understand the benefits of warm fluid aiding digestion. avoid GM foods, Your local green grocery & butcher should be your best friend! Low fat supermarket meat’s are more processed, Aviod anything artificial & check product descriptions for hidden ingredients, Avoid taking oral anti -inflammatorys unless absolutely necessary…Same with ppi’s & antacid medicines, purified chlorine free water, red meat isn’t the enemy… in fact it’s loaded with gut healing L-Glutamine amongst other things just like the cabbage juice. avoid antibiotics like the plague unless absolutely necessary!!! If you have a sinus infection or tonsillitis, tough it out, because the majority of cases are viral in nature and antibiotics do near zero to help/clear infections unless they are bacterial in nature. All that happens is they wreak havoc on your own microbiome and make you more prone to intestinal issues going forward.

I used to be able to fall asleep fairly easily and stay asleep all night. 
Lately I cannot get to sleep and when I do I am waking up after a few hours and struggling to get back to sleep.
I know it’s a combination of perimenopause and general misery with my life right now but I just want some relief.

My current lifestyle:
44F, 170cm, 71kg. I don’t smoke or use drugs, I only drink 1-3 glasses of wine a couple of times a month
I’m a Single mum, have been single 8 years and am at the stage where I’d like to meet someone but I have no luck with dating. That has made me a little sad and deflated lately.
I have an office job I hate. I don’t like sitting in front of a screen all day. I recently asked to reduce my hours to a 9 day fortnight, hoping a day off once a fortnight will make me feel a little less miserable. It’s not stressful work, just boring. I’m looking for a new job.
I work out 4 days a week at the gym. I have to do it after work as I can’t fit in a morning workout with kids at home that need help to get ready for school.
I do a strength training program, I lift heavy weights then do some ab work or high intensity sprint training.
On days off from the gym I often do Pilates at home, rollerskating with my kids, hiking, paddle boarding or kayaking. I’m always very active.
I have one day of rest each week with no intense exercise.
I eat a high protein diet, and I’m currently on a cut, eating 1400cal a day, with around 120g protein. It’s mostly eggs, chicken, lean beef, Greek yogurt and heaps of veggies. I rarely use protein powder to supplement.
I have a coffee at 7.30am and another at about 2.30pm.  The afternoon coffee never used to keep me awake so I don’t know why it would start affecting me now. 
I take ashwaganda, theanine and creatine in the morning, and magnesium glycinate and tryptophan at night. When I really struggle to fall sleep I take melatonin but it’s not working for me any more.
I get up at 7am and go to bed around 10.30pm. I try to stop looking at screens by 10pm but I don’t always achieve that. I shower right before bed and read a book for 15-20 minutes before I sleep. I sleep on my back.

I know that I’m very unhappy with my life at the moment. I hate my job, I don’t have many friends or a social life, I don’t have a great relationship with my mother and I’m a bit lonely. But I don’t think I’m clinically depressed. I still have hope and I’m making plans to improve my life by looking for a new job, considering starting my own business, improving my fitness and losing weight and making travel plans. I have goals and I’m motivated so I don’t feel like I need any medical attention for depression. It’s just my life situation. Also I have been in a lot of therapy in the past and I’ve never found it particularly helpful. I have neither the time or money for it these days (I’m in Australia- it’s expensive here)

I am a person who loves helping others, I take initiative, pride in my work and overall I just enjoy making other people happy. Whether that's my family or at work if a team member needs help with something, I will do whatever I can to assist and solve the problem. I thrive in chaos and enjoy solving problems as they arise, it's always been where I shine.

My background is in project management and I've helped run million dollar jobs. I have 15+ years experience in this kind of environment and I've mainly been in the construction, HVAC and automotive sector.

When I applied for my current job the description was very much a match for what I'm used to doing. Monitoring projects, budgets, dealing with subcontractor and material vendors, all with the express purpose of finishing a project on time and within budget.

I was hired to partner with another woman who had worked for the company for over 25 years and she tended to be someone that wasn't very approachable with the people she worked with and that made it difficult to be effective for the team.

Over the course of my 1st year there she refused to show me anything project/system related and I politely offered help and even mentioned that I was hired to help ease the burden of the overwhelming tasks she dealt with on a daily basis. She would not budge. As a result, I focused on the things I could control and made processes better when none existed and left her to continue her course of work on her own.

Then she quit with no notice and left me to pick up the pieces of a job I was never fully trained to do in the first place. I wasn't worried, I'm resilient and adaptable and I was able to make adjustments as needed. 

The company was implementing a new system and she was one of the people who represented our plant and was supposed to learn and then teach others how to use it. When she left I took her place, having little to no knowledge of the previous system and I then had to self teach myself this new system in addition to creating training to teach others. 

Even then, I wasn't deterred, I know my capabilities and I know when something is too much, this wasn't it. So I spent the next 1.5 years digging into this new system, writing training documents for those affected within the department and giving training, as needed. 

However, when she left it created a void in any relationship I could of had between program managers, engineers, department heads etc.. and as a result all of those people took on those responsibilities for themselves because I believe she had burned them so many times that they either didn't want to deal with me because I was too new at the time or they were worried they would have the same problems. 

As a result, the job responsibilities I have left can be done by either a shipping or billing clerk. Nothing wrong with either of those positions I'm just grossly overqualified to do those tasks. 

In addition, a few months ago my boss took me into a conference room and said to me that I interject myself into issues where I don't belong and I should just stick to doing the job responsibilities I have now. He is constantly telling me he's worried that the teams will start seeing me as someone difficult to work with which I believe is a fear created from my predecessor, but I'm not her and I have never acted like her during any of my work encounters. 

Here are the examples he gave regarding stepping outside my job description:

1. We physically combined two locations together and in the new location I was trying to figure out where the office supply cabinet should go since it's my responsibility to maintain the supplies. I was told just to worry about my desk and forget about helping with the move. I should also note they were okay with me packing up and moving the ENTIRE inventory department and setting it up so this was just an extra portion of my job that I didn't believe would be overstepping. 

2. I organized travel for an international employee coming in from Japan and when I asked if they had sufficient transportation from the airport to their hotel, I was told just worry about the airfare and none of that other stuff was my concern. 

3. An engineer came to me to provide her with a job # so she could charge her time. There was a problem with the project in the system and I emailed accounting to solve it for her, so she could do her job. I was told I shouldn't have sent the email and should have told the engineer to just email accounting to fix it. I couldn't give her a number because of a problem within the project, that portion IS part of my job.

Now that you have the background, here is my problem. I'm being paid decent money to do WAY less than I'm capable of doing and many people are telling me to just accept it.

The pay is good, it's 10 minutes from our house, my children's school and the work/life balance they have is decent as well but...

I feel like I'm being told to just stay in my lane but I know my worth and what I'm capable of doing and it feels hollow to show up every day, take advantage of pay from am employer who realistically doesn't know what they need for staffing and I'm incredibly bored with the tasks I have left.

So what do I do? Look for another job? Be okay with the severely downgraded version of my job and just continue to take advantage? It doesn't feel right to me and I know I'm capable of more and I want to help other companies and people be successful.

I genuinely love seeing others be successful and if I can help them in any way to get them there, then I'm all for it but I'm mostly ignored and never given anything of substance to do. I generate POs, sort the shipments that come in, make sure the coffee and office supplies are stocked and help on the events committee.  

None of that is who I am professionally and it feels hollow working there. 

Your thoughts would be greatly appreciated and I hope those who read to the end has a lovely day themselves. :)

","I've been reflecting on the complexities of navigating health insurance and financial aid in the U.S. For instance, many people aren't aware that earning just $1 over certain income thresholds can disqualify them from ACA subsidies. However, strategies like contributing to an IRA can help lower taxable income and regain eligibility for those subsidies.

This situation is especially challenging for lower-income individuals, who often lack the time and resources to explore these options while managing their daily expenses.

I recently came across a coffee shop owner in New York making around $40,000 a year. He lives with his mother and primarily operates his business from a small space there, allowing him to write off many expenses. Despite the high cost of living, his low reported income enables him to access free health insurance and other benefits, effectively minimizing his tax burden.

I invited my friend/coworker to what we thought was a Halloween cocktail “class” at a new fine-dining restaurant in our area. She agreed, so I went ahead and bought the two tickets for $75  that would apply to our bill at the end. Closer to the date, more info comes out that it’s just a special reservation to order from a specific cocktail menu while dining. Still, sounded cool. I sent her a few screenshots with the menu + pricing and she seemed excited as well. 
Day of our reservation—We went shopping before dinner and she offered to drive. I bought her coffee, she bought me a couple cheap pre-game drinks at a dive bar. At dinner, we drank 1 cocktail each, split an appetizer, split dessert, and each ate an entree of equal price. Total was $180 ($150 in food with price of tickets factored in + $30 tip). She agreed to send me money on Venmo to cover her half since it seemed easier to put it on one card and I already had my wallet out. I told her to just cover her half of the food ($75) and I’ll cover tip ($30) since she bought me a few drinks earlier and drove. She didn’t pay me at dinner despite having her phone out, that’s fine— I don’t want to be pushy. Fast forward two days, nothing. I sent her a friendly text saying something on the lines of “Hey, let me know if you need my Venmo account, blah blah” and apologized for taking her to an expensive place as I began to worry if I roped her into a pricey dinner when she might’ve expected more of an interactive cocktail class. I still haven’t heard from her. Should I have offered to cover dinner since she paid for a few things earlier and drove us around that day? Maybe I’m a bad friend for pressuring her into an expensive dinner, but I also feel like I gave her ample time to let me know if she objected to the idea or wanted to spend less. Now I just feel AWKWARD… I wonder if I was tacky by texting her a reminder and now I worry about our friendship :( ",2,1729379396.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

In the last year our friendship fizzled out a bit because I tried helping her a lot but she didn’t help herself.

Her health was bad & she wasn’t taking care of herself. I know mentally she wasn’t doing well too, but it took a lot of me so I decided to distance myself. 

We talked occasionally, and she’d usually call me when she needed something.. i kept turning down favors lately cause i felt like ive spent so much energy & emotions & money trying to help her.. she called me 2 weeks ago saying she’ll come over but I wasn’t in my hometown.. i told her i missed her. We talked a bit then hung up because my phone was dying.

She called me last week twice (2 days in a row) I didn’t recognize her number 💔 then when I checked I knew it was her & said I’ll call her later. I didn’t know she was in the hospital.

I know now she wanted me to come see her and bring her the baklava she loves and the coffee i make. I didn't know it was her number.. i cant help but think that she needed me and i wasnt there.

I cant get over it and guilt is eating me up. I cant believe shes gone. I feel her presence i can hear her voice, i see her sitting in her usual spot in my living room. I cant believe shes gone. Why did i give up on her? Why wasnt i more sympathetic? 

I wish i was more there for her. Everyones trying to make me feel better by telling me that i did more than i had to.. but why didnt i answer? 💔 ",3,1729379340.0,GriefSupport,2,0.81,False

I observed this interaction while I was at a long-standing UES deli and grocery this morning waiting for my bacon egg and cheese to be made.

A well dressed guy comes in and goes up to the deli counter, which is also where they make the coffee drinks, and says to the man behind the counter ""hey can you just give me a little cup with some half and half in it?""  The man behind the counter  - who, fwiw, is like a manager - is a little confused but eventually says ""we actually sell half and half, you can get a quart over there in the cooler."" The guy says ""no I don't need a quart, I just need a little, come on I come here all the time, can't you just give me a little bit in a cup?""

After some back and forth like this, it became clear to the guy that the man behind the counter was not going to give him any free half and half.  So then he pulls out a dollar from his pocket and says ""I'll give you a dollar."" The man behind the counter says no.  So the guy goes ""All right I guess, thanks anyway."" And he leaves.

","Hi there I'm 21 male. Almost 2 months ago my doc prescribed me Trazodone to help get me sleepy for bed. 

Ever since starting the med I've noticed something strange during the day. 

During the day I take Concerta (ADHD meds). Helps wake me up as if it's coffee, making me feel energized and helps me to focus and get work done. After 4 to 5 hours after taking them and having their usual effects kick I'm suddenly hit with a wave of tiredness. I suddenly loose all motivation and focus to work on homework. But I also get a weird feeling in my throat. 

The best I can explain this feeling is as if I'd just drank sprite (or soda). That after effect of drinking sprite making the back of my throat feel tingly. 

But it's that throat feeling, followed later with the feeling like I'm gonna burp a little but never do. After that then it's the feeling of mucus or something in my throat, then it goes away. 

This happens during the afternoon/evening. If it happens before I go to bed (around 11pm I get ready for bed) and I take Trazodone the effect goes away. It's weird.Ithe throat feeling doesn't feel like a tight feeling. I haven't changed my diet habbits for months so it can't be that. I've never had this feeling with allergies, so I don't think it's that either. I was on 50mg 2 weeks ago, started 100mg 2 weeks ago. Been on Trazodone for 6 weeks now.

I know no one here can give me an ""official diagnosis"". I know that only my doctor can do that. I thought I'd ask here while I wait for my doctor to get back on Monday. 

So is this a common side effect? What might this side effect be? ",1,1729378647.0,sleep,1,0.6,False

At the shop I tried their Compa Hermosa Pink Bourbon Watermelon (not pictured). Right off the bat I smelt the watermelon and the first sip tasted like watermelon. It was the first time I ever had a flavor note be so pronounced in a cup. 

I’m fairly new, a few months into my pour over journey, and couldn’t justify (yet) a $38 bag of coffee. Instead I went with their Koke Honey. I asked for their general recipe that they use before locking it in and they recommended 18-19g of coffee and 320g of water. 

I brewed my first cup the moment I got home. I did my typical hybrid method but followed their dosing. 

• 19g coffee & water temp at 200° (93° C)

• 0-:15 60g bloom

• :45 - 1:15 60g bloom 

• 1:15 -1:45 200g pour. Closed switch and immersed. 

• 1:45-3:00 opened and let it draw down. 

First cup was light, floral and had a faint smell of fruit. 

I think my next attempt I might try 19g and 280g of water. 

Worth trying if you’re in the area. I will be definitely buying more from them in the future. ",11,1729378596.0,pourover,0,0.92,False
