Back in the spring I bought  a used 2021 flagstaff 228se from a dealer. Had some issues so I took it back for repairs(under warranty thankfully) so now I've finally got to take it out. I'm not sure I understand the electrical in it though. Seems like none of the plugs or fridge will work without the inverter being on. Is that normal or is there a bypass switch like the older popups? I know I'm getting shore power because the battery is reading 100 percent and the fridge ran all night. What's weird to me is it cant seem to handle a coffee pot without tripping a GFI but my 30 year old colman could do it no problem. Am I missing something stupid?

1n40196,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1n40196/ward_boundary_change_im_fuming/,Ward boundary change - I'm fuming,"Okay, I'm PIMO, of a sort. Everyone knows I dont believe and no longer consider myself Mormon, my family and ward members included. I still attend on Sundays because that's where my wife is and what's important to her and we have a small but incredible ward who are genuinely welcoming and helpful to our young family (these people do exist, I swear). For me, the community of our ward continues to be enough of a reason to go (though second hour i sit in a cafe sipping coffee usually).

HOWEVER 

It's stake conference weekend and at the leadership meeting (I heard through the grapevine very quickly) that they're disestablishing our ward and merging it with the slightly larger but struggling main ward in the stake centre. This came as such a surprise that apparently our bishop was finding out at the same time as everyone else. 

Why am I mad you ask? Isn't the shrinkage fantastic?? Yes, but...

1. We now have a 25 minute drive to the other side of town instead of a five minute drive 
2. We have 3 kids aged 6 and under and church starts at 9. They have before and I'm sure will yet again refuse to change the start time. Instead of being somewhat stressed every week and arriving late, we'll now have the privilege of getting up even earlier on Sunday and wrangling kids like it's a school day.
3. The changes are immediate. No chance to meet again as our little ward community, no chance to say goodbye or thanks to leaders who have helped us, including financially, for the past 3+ years. We didn‚Äôt even know that last week was the last time we'd meet together as a ward. 

That's all frustrating enough, but the kickers is 

4. No consultation, no feedback process. It's 'trust us, we know what we're doing' which is code for, shut the fuck up and don't ask questions, this is what Jesus would want. The hubris of these men to make major decisions that affect our lives and not consult, not give notice, not provide support, but to expect us to turn up on Sunday, raise our hands to sustain leadership and never ask questions is so on brand. I've already spoken to close friends and family, but they're all Mormon and all apologists who say 'Yes it will be hard, but I trust the men who say they've worked hard and agonised that they are doing what's best'. I don't. I think they're incompent or inconsiderate or some measure of both. 

For fucks sake, when I heard about it i posted on the stake facebook page about who we could talk to about concerns, and the post was promptly deleted. I was then messaged privately and told I would be put in touch with stake leaders. They will pat me on the head, tell me to pray about it, and go on my way. I wont pray cause no one's listening, but it wouldnt matter because if I got a different answer, it would be the wrong one. You see, you have to pray until you come to the same conclusion as the leadership has - that's how the get unfettered obedience and license to make changes unchallenged. And then no one can say anything, because if youre opposed you're possessed by Satan. 

The ONE good thing about this church is the community my family and I actually love and thrive in, and they're ripping that away without second thoughts. Oh and guess what? They're building a temple here. And guess what else? After they combine our ward with the other one at the stake centre? The weekly attendance is expected to sit at around 150. Who the fuck will be manning this temple?? I get why logistically they're merging, but their approach is so myopic it's infuriating. 

My wife is crushed btw. I don't know that it'll bring her further out, but even she was grumbling that this decision was made by men who don't have the burden of childcare to consider when making these changes. She doesnt know how right she is. No woman would have been consulted. The backbone of the church, but the lack of dicks means no godly superpowers apparently. Apparently at the meeting during the announcement one leader joked about being sensitive to widows who will complain about having to drive an extra 20 minutes. Hilarious, if it weren't true, but who cares about mothers and widows, they just need to exercise more faith.

When it's just you and me and our cat and dog, I promise‚Ä¶ you'll be doted over like you've never been before. I'll be making your coffee *exactly* how you like it, opening your car door, making you things, giving you random kisses, pats on the butt, pulling you into my arms, hand on your knee while we watch TV, and, yeah‚Ä¶ whispering sweet nothings into your ear at every opportunity‚Ä¶

But, for now‚Ä¶ I have to resort to words.  
The problem with words, though, is‚Ä¶  
I don't ever know what's gonna come out.

Sometimes I sit down aiming to write you the tenderest, sweetest little ""I see you there, you lovely little thing"" note‚Ä¶ but what comes out is an ode to your butt. Sometimes, the reverse happens‚Ä¶ I *think* I'm gonna write you something that's gonna leave you reaching into your nightstand drawer for whatever might happen to be safely tucked away there‚Ä¶ but what comes out is my heart spilling its whole entire self to you, just reveling in the astonishing warmth of the love I have for you.

But sometimes‚Ä¶  
Nothing.

That's when you get those ""Hey, baby, pretty zonked tonight‚Ä¶"" letters. You know the ones‚Ä¶ maybe feeling a bit dull, a bit forced‚Ä¶

But, baby. Baby. That's not a reflection of how I feel about you, never not ever. *That* never stops, *that* is a never ending fountain of pure unfiltered love. Unfortunately, just‚Ä¶ the creative centers aren't always at their best. Those would be the nights that I would just hold you and play with your hair. The nights I'd give you soft kisses and nuzzle into your neck. Those are the nights I'd love you softly, tenderly, catering to any need you might have‚Ä¶ My voice maybe may not say much, but my hands *would*.

I know this isn't what you meant, but I'd already been thinkin' about it anyways.

I've also been thinking about the past few months‚Ä¶ the vulnerability‚Ä¶ baby, when you started blossoming for me like that‚Ä¶ opening up your petals as to the morning sun‚Ä¶ showing me so much more of you than most, maybe even more of you all at once than anyone‚Ä¶

Baby, *anyone* would be afraid after that. The most securely attached person in the world would still have the vulnerability hangover to end all vulnerability hangovers after that, love. And I should have seen it earlier‚Ä¶ should have been more prepared.

I know we can't avoid *every* storm, but baby I'm working on my weather radar. And my navigation skills. Learning how to better fly on instruments.

Maybe you didn't listen much to that one song I sent you not long ago‚Ä¶ wouldn't blame you, it's, um‚Ä¶ there is a softer version out there, but‚Ä¶ baby‚Ä¶ all I wanted you to hear was

*I can't promise that things won't be broken, but I swear that I will never leave.*

Maybe you're not used to this, sweet love, and you know? Neither am I‚Ä¶ But that doesn't make it any less real, any less true, or any less genuine.

There's something about us, babe.  
And the universe *cannot* get away with keeping it from being.

I won't let it.

School just started for the D1s and is back in full swing for everyone else, which means the posts start rolling in: *‚ÄúThis is so hard. I‚Äôm exhausted. I don‚Äôt know if I can make it.‚Äù*

I get it. I‚Äôve been there. Hell, I am there. I wrote a post a while back about failure and how it shaped me. Not many things in my life have come easy. (Trust me, part-time law school while still working as an OMS. Fun idea on paper‚Ä¶ until you are up at 4:00 writing case briefs.)

But here‚Äôs the thing: **what did you expect?** Easy? Dental school is not designed to be easy. Neither is law school. Neither is life. And that is okay. Actually, it is awesome, you will have a skill that is hard to obtain for many. Difficulty does not mean you do not belong. It means you are in the process of becoming stronger than you were yesterday. My law school professors tell me, *‚ÄúYou are supposed to fail.‚Äù* Back in dental school, it felt like perfection was the only acceptable outcome, especially if you had a removal prosth instructor like mine. That is part of what pushed me toward OMS, I hate prosth.

Right now, I have a D2 son grinding through school, he says he is actually going to class, while I am grinding through law school briefs. I keep reminding both of us: **This too shall pass.** Exams pass. Pre-clinics pass. Professors grilling you until you sweat through your scrubs? That passes too.

Yes, you will be tired. Yes, you will wonder if you are cut out for it. And yes, you will scroll Reddit instead of finishing your notes (hi, guilty). But lean into it. Work hard. Nobody is handing you that DDS/DMD or JD for free, and when you finally walk across that stage, you will know you earned every bit of it.

And do not forget, this is coming from the guy who literally passed out during his first real patient procedure. If I survived that, you will survive your histo exam and ADEX boards. One day, you will laugh at how stressed you were about it. I failed my first clinical boards (patient had a panic attack), and now I am a board member and examiner with ADEX. I'm better because I failed. 

So, to whoever needs this today: **You got this.** Take a breath, grab some coffee, and keep going. Be well and try to enjoy the holiday weekend.

1n4003q,https://www.reddit.com/r/FromWaste_ToAbundance/comments/1n4003q/bokashi_fermentation_the_probiotic_foundation/,Bokashi Fermentation: The Probiotic Foundation (Excerpt from chapter 6),"Bokashi composting is probably one of the most valuable Tier 1 systems because it processes all organic waste including food scraps that traditional composting cannot handle effectively, while creating multiple outputs that support biological systems throughout the Center.

**Understanding Bokashi Biology and Benefits**

Bokashi fermentation uses beneficial microorganisms to process organic matter through anaerobic fermentation rather than aerobic decomposition. This process preserves nutrients while creating beneficial bacterial populations that enhance soil biology, plant health, and even aquaponics system stability.

The fermentation process teaches biological timing, environmental control, and beneficial microorganism management while handling organic waste that would otherwise require disposal or create odor problems in traditional composting.
Simple Bokashi Setup and ManagemManagementent

**Required Materials:**
* Airtight containers (plastic buckets with tight-fitting lids work well)
* Bokashi bran or beneficial microorganism inoculant
* Organic waste materials (kitchen scraps, plant trimmings, etc.)
* Drainage system or spigot for liquid collection

**Fermentation Process:**
Layer organic waste materials with bokashi bran in airtight containers, pressing layers firmly to exclude air while ensuring adequate inoculant distribution. Seal containers tightly and allow fermentation to proceed for 2-3 weeks while collecting liquid that accumulates.

The fermentation process should produce sweet, slightly alcoholic odors without putrefaction smells that indicate improper fermentation. Successful bokashi fermentation preserves food structure while creating beneficial biological activity.

**Managing Different Organic Materials:**
Food scraps including meat, dairy, and other materials that traditional composting cannot handle effectively work well in bokashi systems. Vegetable trimmings, fruit waste, and plant materials ferment incredibly easily while providing diverse nutrition for beneficial microorganisms. Mixing different organic materials creates balanced fermentation while maximizing waste processing capacity.

**Integration Throughout Center Systems**

**Liquid Fertilizer Production:**
Bokashi liquid provides excellent plant nutrition when diluted appropriately while containing beneficial microorganisms that enhance soil biology and plant health. Understanding proper dilution rates (typically 1:100 or greater) ensures plant benefits without over-fertilization.

Bokashi liquid application to aquaponics systems should improve both fish health and plant growth while providing biological enhancement that supports system stability and productivity.

**Mushroom Substrate Applications:**
Fermented bokashi materials provide excellent mushroom substrate that can often be used immediately without pasteurization, dramatically simplifying mushroom cultivation while expanding substrate options beyond coffee grounds and cardboard.

Understanding how bokashi fermentation creates conditions that favor beneficial fungi over harmful microorganisms builds expertise in biological competition while teaching contamination prevention through biological methods.

**Bokashi Recipe Formulations**

**Bokashi Mother Culture: Complete Microorganism Integration**

The development of sophisticated bokashi mother cultures using materials produced entirely within Integration Centers represents the pinnacle of beneficial microorganism management, where crawfish processing waste, kelp cultivation, and sugar production combine to create probiotic solutions that exceed commercial alternatives while demonstrating complete resource utilization principles.

**Complete Center-Produced Mother Culture Formula:**
For 800ml batch (optimal for small-scale production):
* 800ml filtered water (from Center biochar/bone char filtration systems)
* 40g probiotic culture (from existing kefir or commercial starter)
* 28.56ml blackstrap molasses (from sugar beet processing operations)
* 4g crab/crawfish shell meal (from aquaponics processing)
* 4g Himalayan pink salt (mineral enhancement and preservation)
* 4.8g light malt extract powder (from grain processing systems)
* 20-24g kelp meal (from marine aquaculture or sustainable sourcing)
* 4g gypsum (calcium sulfate for optimal bacterial nutrition)

**Enhanced Processing Protocol:**
Combine all ingredients in clean glass containers while maintaining temperatures between 75-85¬∞F using waste heat from energy systems. The crab shell meal provides chitin and calcium that enhance beneficial bacteria development while kelp meal supplies trace minerals and growth factors that optimize probiotic population diversity and activity.

Allow fermentation for 7-10 days while monitoring for healthy bacterial development indicated by pleasant, slightly sour aromas and visible bacterial activity. The resulting mother culture provides starter material for ongoing bokashi production while creating liquid fertilizer concentrates that enhance soil biology throughout Center operations.

**Bokashi Recipe #1: Coffee Ground and Brewery Waste Integration**

This foundational bokashi formulation utilizes readily available waste streams from coffee shops and breweries while creating superior fermentation substrate that demonstrates complete organic waste utilization through beneficial microorganism enhancement.

Bokashi Substrate Composition:
* 30% spent brewer's grain (high protein content and fermentation nutrients)
* 20% used coffee grounds (nitrogen source and biological enhancement)
* 43% cardboard (carbon source and structural matrix)
* 5% biochar (beneficial microorganism habitat and pH buffering)
* 2% gypsum (calcium and sulfur supplementation for optimal biological activity)

**Fermentation Protocol:**
* Bokashi substrate fermentation: 4-6 weeks anaerobic processing
* Moisture management: 60-65% moisture content for optimal fermentation
* Temperature control: 65-75¬∞F for beneficial microorganism activity
* Container sealing: Airtight storage preventing contamination and maintaining anaerobic conditions

This formulation creates premium growing substrate while eliminating disposal costs for coffee shops and breweries, demonstrating how waste stream coordination benefits multiple businesses through regenerative resource sharing.

**Bokashi Recipe #2: Advanced Straw Pellet Formulation**

Complete Ingredient Formulation (1kg dry volume base):

**Primary Components:**
* Straw pellets: 720g (72% of total dry volume) - carbon source and structural matrix
* Biochar: 80g (8% of total dry volume) - biological enhancement and pH buffering  
* Peat moss: 200g (20% of total dry volume) - acid source and moisture retention

**Enhancement Additives:**
* Organic 7-5-7 fertilizer: 100g (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium supplementation)
* Crawfish shell meal: 100g (chitin source and calcium enhancement)
* Blackstrap molasses: 30-60ml (immediate energy for beneficial microorganisms)
* Bokashi starter culture: 50g (beneficial microorganism inoculation)

**Processing Instructions:**
Straw Pellet Preparation:
Soak compressed straw pellets for several hours until complete moisture absorption and expansion, creating loose straw matrix suitable for fermentation processing.

**Dry Ingredient Integration:**
Combine expanded straw pellets, biochar, peat moss, organic fertilizer, and crab shell meal in large mixing container while ensuring even distribution throughout the mixture.

**Molasses Integration:**
Dissolve blackstrap molasses in warm water (approximately 1 cup) before adding to dry ingredients, ensuring even distribution of energy sources for beneficial microorganisms.

**Moisture Optimization:**
Gradually add water while mixing until mixture achieves 60-70% moisture content - mixture should feel moist without dripping excess water when squeezed firmly.

**Beneficial Microorganism Inoculation:**
Sprinkle bokashi starter culture throughout mixture while mixing thoroughly, ensuring even distribution of beneficial microorganisms for optimal fermentation.

**Fermentation Management:**
Pack mixture tightly into fermentation containers or sealed bags, maintaining anaerobic conditions in dark, warm location (60-80¬∞F) for 1-2 weeks until sour fermentation smell indicates completion.

Here's my 600 hours update. I made a 300 hr update you can find in my profile. 

Background: I feel like the level 5 road map description generally fits my current listening abilities. I studied Spanish in school (middle, high school, one semester in college) 15+ years ago. Brief periods of self-study over the years. Started DS in April with 50 initial hours. I also started using Duolingo at the same time and am currently halfway through the Spanish course. 

300-600 hours: I gradually started incorporating more native content on Youtube. In the past 100 hours I‚Äôm probably getting 80-90% of my input outside of DS. When I started watching native content I needed to be watching the video, slow down to .9, and sometimes put Spanish subtitles on.  Now at 600 hours, videos where it‚Äôs just one person talking to the camera are typically no problem, but rapid exchanges, lots of slang, and fast-talkers are still a challenge.

The main channels I was watching were: 
Rose Bennet 
Luisito Comunica 
31 Minutos 

I feel these three are on the easier end from a ‚ÄúCI‚Äù standpoint. Other channels I watched some of and will probably watch more of going forward: Leyendas Legendarias, No Hay Tos, Historia Para Tontos,  PutoMikel, The Wild Project, Lethal Crisis  

Wins: There are an increasing number of native content videos / channels I can watch without feeling like I‚Äôm ‚Äútrying‚Äù overly hard to follow along, or at least, I am only occasionally losing the thread of the speaker, even if I don't understand every word.  At 50 hours I tried watching 31 Minutos, thinking it would be beginner-friendly (its got puppets, it must be an easy kids show‚Ä¶), but I barely understood anything, even slowed down. Now it‚Äôs something fun to put on  in the morning when I‚Äôm waking up and making coffee . While I‚Äôm obviously still not at 100% comprehension all the time, it feels like its only a matter of more input before my vocab and brain processing speeds catch up a bit more. Another win, if you can call it that, is I don't feel as intimidated trying new/ harder stuff. 

Goals for level 5: My listening goals are to improve my understanding of ‚Äúreal-world‚Äù conversations and focus on more casual podcasts. I haven‚Äôt been reading or speaking yet, but plan to start in the next couple hundred hours. I hope to hit 1000 hours by the end of the year, though I no longer feel a sense of urgency to hit an arbitrary amount of input by an arbitrary date. 

Final thoughts: Interestingly, there seems to be two opposite approaches often shared here when you hit motivation / progress wall - move up or move down in difficulty. I'm in the move up in difficulty camp. If it means you are more interested and engaged then dropping a bit of comprehension % is a small price.  That said, everyones backgrounds and brains are different, so they're isn't a correct answer. I also don't think it probably really matters what you choose to listen to, as long as you keep going!

That's all for now! I'd be happy to hear your suggestions for books, italki tutors, new channels / shows etc!

I (37F) met this guy (40M) on Facebook. We hit it off great, exchanged numbers, and started texting everyday. We shared lots of personal stuff with each other and after about 1.5 to 2 weeks of talking we decided to go on a lunch date. Well he had been joking about me coming to his work to bug him so I decided two days before the date that I was gonna bring him some coffee to work as a surprise. This was also because I was nervous and wanted to see him before our date to ease nerves during our date. So I took him a coffee and we talked for like an hour and a half. He even texted me after and told me that he really wanted to kiss me. So we continued to talk to each other for the next two days and when Friday came around he had to cancel the date because of a migraine. I believed him because he said previously that he gets military disability for migraines and PTSD. So we rescheduled for the next Wednesday. That weekend he had his daughter and I was having my daughter‚Äôs birthday party, but we still talked a ton. This included a conversation Saturday night that started after he texted me that he was thinking about me and just wanted me to know that. Then we talked for an hour and decided that we really wanted to see each other again before Wednesday, so we agreed to meet at the mall on Sunday after he dropped his daughter off. We met there and walked around for a while talking. He held my hand, then put his arms around me and kissed the top of my head. At one point I kissed him on the cheek and he smiled. We eventually made our way outside to a bench because the mall was closing soon and as we sat talking, he kissed me. Then we spent the next 20 minutes just kissing. After that we went to his car and hung out for a bit because the mall was closed. We spent another maybe hour just talking and kissing. No sex happened just A LOT of really good kissing. He even referred to me as his soon to be girlfriend. When we eventually parted ways I texted him to tell him I was falling for him and he said he was falling for me too. Then we texted a bunch. He had to work the next two days so he couldn‚Äôt text as much, but when he did text he told me that his day was going rough. He works as a security officer at a hospital, he‚Äôs also an army veteran. The second day he worked, which would have been Tuesday, he texted me at one point near the end of his shift and said he had to physically fight a woman and she scratched him. He didn‚Äôt talk much after that. I texted him that night to let him know I was excited about our date the next day. When Wednesday came he texted me this ‚ÄúGood morning.  I am sorry i haven‚Äôt been talking as much.  Last two days were rough and today is a particularly bad day too.   I am trying to muster through it, and I do want to see you today.  Just trying to get through this mental stuff right now.  Again I am sorry about this.‚Äù I have not heard from him since. I did send a few follow up texts just to check on him, but I don‚Äôt want to be too punchy if he‚Äôs dealing with some stuff. I do know how bad mental health issues can get. I guess my question is: do you guys think he is just taking time to recover from his mental health state, or was this the world‚Äôs most f‚Äôed up way to ghost someone?",1,1756555612.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

In the morning I have coffee with almond or soy milk, and sometimes even some collagen. I wait until somewhere between noon and 2 PM to have my first meal, and then wrap things up around 9 or 10 PM. This is not true TRE -- I am having around 100 - 150 calories in that morning coffee (sometimes with collagen.) However, I have noticed some real benefits to this approach, such as that I'm not constantly thinking about food, have great focus and energy, and if I'm at a restaurant -- I seem to be satisfied sooner and don't really have cravings for the extra French fries on my child's plate, dessert, etc. I have tried TRE before and have been strict! nothing but black coffee until the window opens and during those times I struggled. I would think about food ALL morning and then kind of overdo it when the window opened. I wanted to share in case this helps anyone struggling with doing it the really strict way. Yes, I know, I'm like not achieving autophagy, but I have lost weight (yay!) and my resting heart rate has gone down. I have not taken my BP but I would bet that has gone down, too. But the best part is really just fewer cravings -- I am able to eat about 400 - 500 calories less in a day without feeling like it's very hard. ",6,1756555598.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

The checklist also reminds me to mention where extra towels are stored, how the coffee maker works, and that bizarre sound the refrigerator makes at 2am that isn't a burglar. What makes this effective is how specific it is to my home's peculiarities. After using this system for a year, guests consistently mention feeling more comfortable, and I've eliminated those awkward middle-of-the-night texts asking how to operate basic household features.

TW harassment, stalking and mental health.

Over 10 years ago I worked at a cafe in a supermarket in my home town. We would sell food, coffee and sweet treats (brownies, flapjacks and muffins). We had cleaners that worked for the supermarket that would help to keep the cafe clean aswell. 

One afternoon shift, there was me, the team leader (Macey) and the cook (Adam). I was out in the sitting area doing some cleaning, wiping tables and clearing rubbish when one of the store cleaners came up to do the floor and glass cleaning. I went behind the counter and done some more tidying behind there while he worked. 

After 10 minutes, he finished his work and asked to use a pen. I handed him my pen by holding the lid, he then stroked my hand while keeping eye contact. I was shaken he gave me the creeps. As he gave my pen back he held it with no room for someone to take it back without hand contact again. I took it without comment or looking at him and when he left I told Macey and Adam exactly what happened.

When I came back for my next shift three days later, out cafe manager (Rob) was in and he asked to talk to me about what happened. Apparently Macey had told him about that shift and Rob needed my part of the story. Apparently, the cleaner had came back everyday asking about ""the lovely blonde lady"" and where was I? 

At the point everyone was put on alert and Rob asked if I wanted to take it further, of corse I did, we then went to the manager of the supermarket about the situation. She explained that they'd talk to the cleaner and tell him that the other cleaners would deal with the cafe from now on and he couldn't get up there.

For two weeks I didn't see him or hear about him, untill three weeks after the incident, when I was told he was fired.

Apparently, for them three weeks he'd make excuses to go to the cafe, he'd either ""forget"" something in the closed cafe and try to go in, or try to clean the cafe when he knew he wasn't aloud in there anymore.

The last straw, he was seen at 4am, stood in the empty car park ""directing traffic"". We found out after he was fired that he had a mental illness and had stopped taking his medication after he met me. He wanted to ""be himself"" for me.

Hey everyone! üôå

So, here we are ‚Äî after lots of late nights and endless brain-storming sessions, **the day has come**! You‚Äôre finally ready to launch your faceless business, right? ü§© It‚Äôs both exhilarating and scary, isn‚Äôt it? Trust me, you‚Äôre not alone! 

As we dive into this exciting world of automation, I wanted to share a **3-step growth automation guide** that‚Äôs practically a treasure map for us. Seriously, I‚Äôm super excited to spill the beans on this before someone patents it. üòú

**Step 1: Identify Your Niche**  
I get it‚Äîthis might sound like a no-brainer, but hear me out.  
- Think about what you‚Äôre passionate about. 
- Who are your peeps? What problems can you solve for them?  
- Aim for the sweet spot where your interests and their needs meet. 

*Example*: I‚Äôve seen some killer faceless brands in everything from quirky animal memes (hello, cat lovers!) to digital productivity hacks. Find that golden nugget!

**Step 2: Build Your Arsenal**  
So, now that you know what you wanna do, here‚Äôs where the fun begins: automation tools! üõ†Ô∏è  
- Consider utilizing AI content creators for social posts, blogs, and emails.  
- Use a scheduling tool to keep your content flowing without you having to babysit it. 

Not to sound like a salesperson, but if you haven't checked out **this helpful guide** [here](https://whop.com/howtoai/?a=liveitupdeals), it‚Äôs got some gems for you to kick off the automation process. Just picture yourself sipping coffee while your content works in the background! ‚òïÔ∏è

**Step 3: Engage & Evolve**  
This step is crucial! Don‚Äôt just sit back and relax as you launch your empire.  
- **Connect with your audience**: Respond to comments, ask for feedback, and build that community.  
- **Analyze your metrics**: Use tools to track which content hits the right note and which... let's be real... flops. 

Okay, can we just take a moment to appreciate how much time this saves you? You‚Äôre not just building a business; you‚Äôre crafting your empire while wearing pajamas! ü•≥ 

Now, a little light-hearted reality check:  
- Ever launch something and realize your audience prefers cat videos over your insightful blog? üôà We‚Äôve all been there! It‚Äôs all part of the journey!

So, here's to all of you faceless warriors gearing up to conquer your ceaseless ambition. Remember, it's all about leveraging the tools, boosting your creativity, and maybe, just maybe, stealing a few hours of sleep! üòè

I‚Äôve been a long-time listener, but this is my first time posting on Reddit‚Äîso if there are any mistakes, I‚Äôm sorry in advance. English isn‚Äôt my first language, so there might be some grammar issues. :) And this a throwaway because its very deep and personal :)

Now, onto the story‚Äîit‚Äôs going to be a long and bumpy ride, so buckle up.

I (F, 26) am currently studying. I‚Äôm the only one in my entire program who wears a hijab. So, if you know, you know‚Äîit was very challenging to make friends, even though I was born in this country but don‚Äôt look like the majority.

Over time, I met some very kind expats. Compared to my friends, I‚Äôm more religious‚ÄîI don‚Äôt drink, for example‚Äîso it‚Äôs been difficult to find a community where I feel fully accepted for who I am, especially in this completely new phase of life.

Bear with me, this information will be important later.

I grew up in a very cult-like environment. Shame and guilt were instilled in me from a very young age, and things didn‚Äôt get any better as I grew older. I experienced SA from my father at a very young age. I didn‚Äôt receive any support from my mother, and I had to continue living with him for many years. As a result, PTSD, depression, and suicide attempts ended up on my ""bingo card.""

The only legal way to move out at 15/16 in my situation was to attend a very strict religious boarding school run by nuns (or something similar). Yeah, it sounds like a bad telenovela‚ÄîI know, I‚Äôm sorry.

After that, I moved to a few different countries. Then COVID hit, and I had to move back in with my family. My mental health took another huge hit.

So now you know the bigger picture.

Today, I‚Äôm working toward my master‚Äôs degree in a very challenging program. I‚Äôm proud of myself for that‚Äîbut mentally, things aren‚Äôt great. Still, ‚Äúfake it till you make it‚Äù has kind of become my profession at this point.

So now here is were i might fucked up very big . 

I met this friend (M 26) at the beginng from the semester. We occasionaly hang before class o went afterwards to lunch. He was a very kind soul and always surrounded by people. So hung more often with him and his friends and we grew closer over time. I met my new community and had a great time and we lived all at the campus so saw every studednt on a regular bases, as well him. So to be nice i invited him for a coffee if we were sitting there or when were grabbing some food. Over time felt kinda weird vibes but couldnt understand it completly. Now looking back i understand that he kinda seperated me from his friends. I invited him like every other day to sit with my friends but he never invited be outside of my ""bubble"" and try to seclude, i think.

During the exam phase, we studied together with the group and often sat down late into the night. It felt supportive and motivating.

But then, I hit a very dark place. I went through a really bad depressive episode‚Äîlike, really, really bad. I was barely functioning, and everything felt overwhelming. Before that happened, we‚Äôd had some deep, heart-to-heart conversations and had grown closer as friends. I trusted him, so I opened up and told him my whole story in a very vulnerable position.

But telling him everything didn‚Äôt really help me. I think saying those things out loud actually triggered me more‚Äîit dragged me even further down. In the days after that conversation, I completely dissociated. I wasn‚Äôt really talking, I wasn‚Äôt living‚ÄîI was just surviving hour by hour, battling through every moment.

He could tell something had changed. But the truth is, he became a trigger for me. I started trying to avoid him. Every time I looked at him, I relived everything I had shared‚Äîover and over again.

And I know that‚Äôs very unfair to him. But at that point, I was barely hanging on mentally. I couldn‚Äôt tell the difference between reality and the flood of PTSD-driven emotions and memories. 

I was still able to hang out with my other friends because they were blissfully unaware of everything. With them, I could pretend‚Äîkeep things light, act ""normal."" But with him, it became so heavy.

He had this urge to check in on me all the time‚Äîasking if I was okay, looking at me across the table like he was waiting for something. He wanted to have these big, emotional talks, to connect deeply‚Äîbut I just couldn‚Äôt handle it. It felt overwhelming, like I was being pulled back into everything I was trying so hard to survive. 

He kept asking if we could talk‚Äîevery time we saw each other. And slowly, he started trying to pull me away from the group I felt safe with. I don‚Äôt think he did it in a malicious way, but it made everything harder for me.

At some point, I asked him clearly: please don‚Äôt ask me anything right now, and give me space. I needed room to breathe‚Äîto exist‚Äîwithout being pushed into emotional conversations I wasn‚Äôt ready for.

He‚Äôs a big overthinker and a very anxious person. But when I told him that I didn‚Äôt want to talk about anything because I was dissociated and that my only goal was to pass the exam, he took it as a very personal attack. 

About two months ago, I applied for Erasmus but didn‚Äôt get any response. We talked about it casually, and I mentioned that I had applied mostly for fun and wasn‚Äôt really in the right headspace to actually go‚Äîeven if I got accepted.

All my friends joked about it in a light, friendly way, saying I was ‚Äúsneaky‚Äù and ‚Äúmoving in the shadows.‚Äù It was all in good fun. But *his* reaction was really disturbing.

First, he turned bright red. Then he suddenly shouted, **‚ÄúI hope you don‚Äôt get accepted,‚Äù** and immediately after that, he went pale. This happened in public‚Äîon campus, right next to a big group of people. I didn‚Äôt know how to react. Honestly, I got a bit scared.

All of that happened within two days‚Äîafter I had asked him for space. I couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore. It felt like he was overstepping my boundaries completely, so I started avoiding him. I didn‚Äôt talk to him or even look at him when we were sitting at the same table.

After that, I heard from a very good friend that he got into a fistfight‚Äîapparently right after hearing the news that I might actually be going on Erasmus. It sounded like he thought I was doing it on purpose, and the fight happened in traffic, of all places.

Every time I saw him, I got a really bad feeling in my gut.

That feeling lasted for about a week, and then the semester break started.

But now‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what to do.

So i did ignore him completly and if he askes i say that everything is fine between us and didnt communicat with him at all. 

So lovely redditors AITHA ? and what should i do ? U advise r very welcome. ",2,1756554764.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False
1n3zoc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1n3zoc0/ftd_fixations_bad_social_behavior/,"FTD fixations, bad social behavior","This week on America‚Äôs favorite show, ‚ÄúFixations with Mom,‚Äù the theme is random men on the bus! 

My mom has FTD. Stage 4 on her best days, 5 on others. Worse aphasia, confusion, frustration, both impulse control and judgment are gone. Meanwhile her body is doing fine (minus incontinence and arthritis she aggravates by walking way too much‚Äî 8 to 10 miles per day on paved trails around her neighborhood.) This isn‚Äôt exactly wandering, she doesn‚Äôt get lost (yet)‚Äî she‚Äôs been doing this for MANY years safely and it‚Äôs an important routine. She‚Äôs very weight/fitness fixated, she was a model in earlier chapters of her life. Of course she no longer understands why her arthritic knee is swollen at the end of the day. 

She lives on her own but I‚Äôm there every day. She‚Äôs on Medicaid but qualified for long-term care. She‚Äôs in this horrible gray area time before she inevitably ends up in a nursing home. I have arranged in-home care part time while I‚Äôm at work and I handle all other things‚Äî I cook meals, her stove is unplugged, etc. We seemed to be in a good rhythm for a bit. Her apartment (HUD‚Äî there‚Äôs no money) is on the campus of a retirement community. We are lucky because it‚Äôs safe and she has access to a few amenities. There‚Äôs a campus bus she can ride, and she goes to the store to get her ‚Äúgroceries‚Äù (mostly candy and yogurt). As she‚Äôs worsened she‚Äôs gotten weirder with other people‚Äî and here we go!! She has developed a fixation on a 90 year old guy on the bus! 

Within the past week she asked (on the bus) to live with him. He was flabbergasted and of course said no. Because the bus picks him up at his house she knew where he lived. She walked to his house, showed up on two occasions over separate days, rang the doorbell, asked to live with him. He said no again. Yesterday I guess she went to his house and found the door unlocked. He‚Äôd stepped out for a quick coffee at his neighbor‚Äôs. She entered his home without permission and when he got back she was inside sitting on his bed. He lost it (of course, can you imagine!?) and she left, but he‚Äôs very rattled. He reported to the campus housing office that he feels unsafe and that if she interacts with him again he‚Äôs getting the police involved. 

I convinced the campus bus driver not to pick her up anymore, but god, I know she‚Äôs going to lose it when he drives past her building without scooping her. I‚Äôm worried how that could escalate. 

Her doctors and social workers say she is definitely not ready for a nursing home bed. She‚Äôs still very active, very social. She gets rides to church, participates in several church groups. When confronted about this misbehavior she denied it, but she‚Äôs always been a liar. Eventually she admitted that she had indeed been to his house a few times. 

What on earth do I do now? Any thoughts? Guidance? I‚Äôm at a loss on this one.

1n3zmyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeStressTest/comments/1n3zmyx/should_you_trust_the_abrkdog_anti_barking_device/,Should You Trust the ABRKDOG Anti Barking Device for Dogs?,"I've been using the ABRKDOG B0DSHMY86W anti-barking device daily for a few weeks now, and it‚Äôs definitely been a mixed bag of experiences. As someone who juggles life with a high-energy dog that seems to enjoy barking at air, I was genuinely excited to try this out. This handheld pet gadget promises to curtail excessive barking with ultrasonic technology, a built-in laser for training, and a flashlight feature for safety. It sounded like the answer to my morning coffee being interrupted by surprise barking marathons. But like any product, it comes with its highs and lows.

**Design and Portability**  
Straight out of the box, this thing looks slick. Its white finish is clean, its compact size fits easily in your pocket or the palm of your hand, and at just 2.89 ounces, it won‚Äôt weigh you down during long walks. This makes it perfect for quick grabs when your dog gets too enthusiastic about alerting the whole neighborhood. Durability-wise, the construction feels solid, though I wasn't overly confident it would survive a drop on concrete. On the plus side, it‚Äôs easy for both teenagers and adults to use, but younger kids might find the controls a bit tricky to manage without supervision.

**Ease of Use and Features**  
Using the anti-barking device is pretty intuitive. The high-frequency ultrasonic sound, adjustable for sensitivity, is claimed to catch your dog's attention and curb barking. I liked being able to tweak the settings to better match my dog‚Äôs reactions. The built-in laser for training was another nice touch, especially when paired with verbal commands. As a bonus, the LED flashlight is great for evening walks‚Äîit genuinely feels like a life-saver for making my dog visible in the dark. However, my German Shepherd was skeptical of the laser‚Äôs appeal. While it grabbed his attention briefly, treating it as more of a curiosity than a behavior correction tool, I couldn‚Äôt honestly say it changed habits in any lasting way. 

**Strengths**  
- Compact and lightweight design, fitting easily into pockets  
- Adjustable ultrasonic frequency, allowing for tailored setups  
- Versatile features including a flashlight and laser pointer  
- USB Type-C charging ensures quick recharges, saving time  

[Check ABRKDOG B0DSHMY86W price on Amazon.](https://verycosy.com/p/b0dshmy86w/)

**Weaknesses**  
Like any device promising miraculous behavior solutions for pets, it‚Äôs not perfect. The ultrasonic feature depends heavily on your dog's temperament. For instance, my more stubborn pup completely ignored it, while my neighbor‚Äôs milder Golden Retriever responded instantly. Another issue I faced was the limited range. Advertised as effective up to 30 feet, I found success mostly within a 10-15 foot range‚Äîsomething to keep in mind if you have a larger yard or want to use it on long outdoor walks. Lastly, the battery‚Äôs longevity wasn‚Äôt mind-blowing. It‚Äôs adequate if you remember to charge it often, but it won‚Äôt get you through an entire weekend away unless you have access to power.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The ultrasonic range feels shorter than advertised  
- Limited effectiveness on more stubborn dog breeds  
- Battery life could use a boost for extended outings  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other anti-bark gadgets like the PetSafe Ultrasonic Bark Control, this anti-barking device offers a few extras, such as the laser pointer and flashlight. However, the PetSafe model delivers more consistent ultrasonic effectiveness over a slightly broader range. Alternatively, the MODUS Ultrasonic Dog Bark Deterrent offers a similar handheld design with strong customer satisfaction for responsiveness but lacks the multi-functional features present in this product. Balancing the laser and flashlight perks against slight inconsistencies in reaction strength ultimately depends on what‚Äôs most important to you.

**Value Assessment**  
For the price, it‚Äôs a decent investment. You get a reasonably well-rounded device featuring an ultrasonic trainer, laser pointer, and flashlight in one unit. Yes, it might lag behind in terms of consistency, but the versatility makes it a suitable choice for those looking to tackle multiple concerns with their pet‚Äôs behavior. It won‚Äôt replace proper training, though, which played a big role in my overall perception.

1n3zhn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n3zhn7/the_inner_fire_that_transforms_setbacks_into/,The Inner Fire That Transforms Setbacks Into Success,"
Life has a peculiar way of testing us. Just when we think we've figured everything out, reality throws us a curveball that leaves us questioning our abilities, our worth, and our direction. But here's something fascinating: the very same force that can make us stumble is also the one that can lift us higher than we ever imagined.

## The Hidden Power Within Every Setback üí™

Think about the last time something didn't go your way. Maybe you didn't get that promotion, your business idea fell flat, or a relationship ended unexpectedly. In that moment, you probably felt defeated, maybe even a little lost. But what happened next? If you're like most people, something inside you started to stir ‚Äì a quiet but persistent voice saying, ""This isn't over.""

That voice? That's your inner fire speaking.

## What Exactly Is This Inner Fire? üî•

This isn't about mystical energy or cosmic forces. We're talking about something much more practical and observable: your sense of self, your pride, your refusal to accept defeat as final. It's the part of you that says, ""I am more than this setback."" It's your identity pushing back against circumstances that threaten to diminish you.

Some people call it pride. Others might label it stubbornness. But when channeled correctly, it becomes the most powerful comeback fuel you'll ever find.

## How Disappointment Becomes Rocket Fuel üöÄ

Here's where things get interesting. Every loss, every rejection, every moment when life says ""no"" to you, it's actually adding fuel to an internal engine. Think of it like this:

**The Pressure Cooker Effect**: Just as pressure transforms simple ingredients into something extraordinary, life's disappointments create internal pressure that can propel you toward achievements you never thought possible.

**The Proof Mechanism**: When someone or something suggests you're not good enough, capable enough, or worthy enough, your inner fire immediately starts gathering evidence to prove otherwise. It becomes obsessed with demonstration.

**The Clarity Creator**: Nothing clarifies what you really want like being told you can't have it. Sudden clarity about your goals and desires emerges from the fog of disappointment.

## Real-World Applications: Turning Fire Into Action üíº

### In Your Career
Next time you face a professional setback, instead of dwelling on the disappointment, ask yourself: ""How can I use this experience to become undeniably valuable?"" Maybe that rejection letter becomes motivation to acquire new skills. Perhaps being passed over for promotion pushes you to start your own venture.

### In Relationships
When personal relationships don't work out as expected, your inner fire can drive you toward becoming the person you've always wanted to be. Not to win someone back, but to prove to yourself that you're capable of growth and transformation.

### In Personal Projects
That failed attempt at learning a new language, writing a book, or starting a fitness routine? Your inner fire remembers every abandoned goal and whispers, ""We're better than this."" Use that energy to approach the challenge with renewed strategy and determination.

## The Daily Practice of Harnessing Your Inner Fire üéØ

### Morning Momentum
Start each day by acknowledging one thing you want to prove ‚Äì to yourself, not to others. It could be as simple as ""I can maintain focus for three hours straight"" or as ambitious as ""I can build something meaningful.""

### Setback Reframing
When disappointment hits, give yourself exactly five minutes to feel the frustration. Then ask: ""What does this situation want to teach me about what I'm truly capable of?""

### Evidence Collection
Keep a running list of times when you've overcome challenges. Your inner fire burns brighter when it's fed with reminders of past victories, no matter how small.

### Channel the Energy
Physical activity is one of the fastest ways to transform frustration into forward momentum. When your inner fire is burning hot, use that energy for a workout, a challenging project, or tackling something you've been avoiding.

## The Science Behind the Comeback üß†

Research in psychology shows that people who view setbacks as temporary challenges rather than permanent defeats tend to bounce back stronger. This isn't just positive thinking ‚Äì it's about activating what researchers call ""psychological reactance.""

When we feel our freedom or capabilities are being threatened or questioned, we naturally push back. This reaction, when properly directed, becomes the driving force behind remarkable comebacks.

## Avoiding the Pitfalls ‚ö†Ô∏è

Your inner fire is powerful, but like any force, it needs proper direction:

**Don't Let It Burn Others**: Use your energy to build yourself up, not to tear others down. Revenge might feel satisfying temporarily, but it ultimately wastes the very energy that could fuel your success.

**Avoid Reckless Risks**: The fire can make you feel invincible, leading to poor decision-making. Channel intensity into strategic action, not impulsive choices.

**Stay Grounded**: Remember that this fire should serve your long-term growth, not just your immediate emotional needs.

## The Long Game: Building Lasting Resilience üèóÔ∏è

The most successful people aren't those who never face setbacks ‚Äì they're the ones who've learned to consistently transform setbacks into comebacks. They've developed a relationship with their inner fire that's sustainable over decades.

### Sustainable Intensity
Instead of burning bright and burning out, learn to maintain a steady flame that can sustain you through multiple challenges and victories.

### Wisdom Through Repetition
Each comeback teaches you something new about your capabilities. Over time, you develop an unshakeable confidence that comes not from never failing, but from repeatedly proving you can recover.

### Building Others Up
As you master the art of the comeback, you naturally become someone who can help others discover their own inner fire. This creates a positive cycle that benefits everyone around you.

## Your Next Steps Forward ‚û°Ô∏è

Right now, today, you have the opportunity to start viewing your challenges differently. That project that didn't work out, that goal you haven't achieved yet, that situation that's been frustrating you ‚Äì these aren't evidence of your limitations. They're fuel for your fire.

Here's what you can do immediately:

**Identify Your Current Challenge**: What's one area where you feel you haven't lived up to your potential?

**Feel the Fire**: Instead of suppressing the frustration or disappointment, acknowledge it. That discomfort is your inner fire trying to get your attention.

**Create Your Proof Plan**: What specific actions could you take to demonstrate your capabilities in this area? Make them concrete and measurable.

**Start Small but Start Today**: Take one small action that moves you toward proving what you're capable of.

## The Timeless Truth üé≠

Throughout human history, the greatest achievements have come not from people who never faced adversity, but from those who learned to transform adversity into advantage. This pattern doesn't change with technology, culture, or time ‚Äì it's a fundamental aspect of human nature.

Your inner fire isn't just a temporary emotional response to disappointment. It's your built-in system for ensuring that no setback has the final word in your story. When you learn to work with this force instead of against it, you discover that every loss really can become the foundation for a greater comeback.

The question isn't whether you have this fire ‚Äì you do. The question is whether you'll learn to use it constructively, consistently, and consciously to create the life you actually want.

Remember: every master was once a disaster who refused to let the disaster be their final chapter. Your inner fire is waiting to write yours. üî•

In a world where conformity often feels like the safest path, there's something revolutionary about embracing what makes you different. Your quirks, unconventional thoughts, and unique perspectives aren't flaws to hide‚Äîthey're superpowers waiting to be unleashed.

## The Conformity Trap We All Face üé≠

Every day, we're bombarded with messages telling us how to look, think, and behave. Social media feeds show us the ""perfect"" life, workplaces reward those who follow the script, and society often celebrates the average over the exceptional. It's no wonder so many people spend years trying to fit into boxes that were never meant for them.

But here's the truth: the very things that make you feel out of place might be exactly what the world needs.

## Why Different Minds Change the World üöÄ

Throughout history, the people who've made the biggest impact weren't the ones who blended in. They were the outliers, the questioners, the ones who saw possibilities where others saw problems.

Think about the entrepreneurs who built companies from their garages, the artists who created movements, or the innovators who solved problems everyone else accepted as unchangeable. They all had one thing in common: they refused to let their differences become limitations.

## Your Daily Uniqueness Audit ‚ú®

Start recognizing your unique traits with these practical steps:

**Morning Reflection:**
Take five minutes each morning to identify one thing you do differently from others. Maybe you solve problems in an unconventional way, or you notice details others miss.

**Embrace Your Natural Rhythms:**
If you're most creative at midnight while others are morning people, work with your natural flow instead of fighting it.

**Document Your Unique Perspectives:**
Keep a journal of moments when your viewpoint differs from the crowd. These aren't signs you're wrong‚Äîthey're indicators of your unique value.

## Turning Differences into Daily Advantages üí™

Your uniqueness isn't just something to celebrate‚Äîit's something to strategically leverage:

**In Your Career:**
- Volunteer for projects that align with your unique strengths
- Share your unconventional ideas during brainstorming sessions
- Position yourself as the go-to person for your particular expertise

**In Relationships:**
- Stop apologizing for your interests and passions
- Find communities where your differences are valued
- Be the friend who brings fresh perspectives to conversations

**In Problem-Solving:**
- When everyone else is stuck, your different approach might be the breakthrough
- Trust your instincts even when they go against popular opinion
- Use your unique background to connect dots others can't see

## The Courage to Stay Different ü¶ã

Embracing your uniqueness requires courage because it means accepting that not everyone will understand or appreciate you. Some people might try to dim your light because it makes them uncomfortable with their own choices to blend in.

**Building Your Confidence:**
- Surround yourself with people who celebrate your differences
- Practice saying ""I see it differently"" instead of staying silent
- Remember that discomfort often signals growth

**Dealing with Criticism:**
- Distinguish between constructive feedback and pressure to conform
- Use criticism as data, not as a verdict on your worth
- Remember that the most innovative ideas often face the strongest resistance

## Your Difference is Someone Else's Solution üîë

Every problem that exists today will be solved by someone thinking differently. Your unique perspective might be the key to:

- A business challenge your company is facing
- A creative project that needs fresh eyes
- A social issue that requires innovative approaches
- A personal struggle someone in your circle is experiencing

The solutions you see clearly might be invisible to others precisely because of your different vantage point.

## Practical Steps to Amplify Your Uniqueness üìà

**Start Small:**
- Share one unconventional idea in your next team meeting
- Wear something that reflects your personality instead of following trends
- Take a different route to work and notice what others miss

**Think Bigger:**
- Apply for opportunities that seem ""not quite right"" for your background
- Start a project that combines your unusual mix of interests
- Teach others about something you know that most people don't

**Go All In:**
- Build a career around your unique combination of skills
- Create content that only you could create
- Become known for your distinctive approach to common challenges

## The Ripple Effect of Authenticity üåä

When you fully embrace your differences, you give others permission to do the same. Your courage to be authentic creates a ripple effect that extends far beyond your immediate circle.

Children notice when adults are genuinely themselves. Colleagues feel safer sharing their own unique ideas. Friends become more comfortable expressing their true thoughts. Your authenticity becomes a catalyst for others to discover and embrace their own uniqueness.

## Living Your Truth Every Day üåà

Being different isn't a one-time decision‚Äîit's a daily practice. Some days it will feel natural and empowering. Other days, the pull toward conformity will feel overwhelming. Both experiences are normal.

The key is remembering that your differences aren't just random quirks‚Äîthey're part of your unique contribution to the world. Every time you choose authenticity over approval, you're not just being true to yourself; you're offering the world something it can't get anywhere else.

Your perspective, shaped by your unique experiences and natural tendencies, is irreplaceable. The world doesn't need another copy of someone else‚Äîit needs the original you.

So tomorrow morning, instead of asking ""How can I fit in better?"" ask ""How can I contribute my unique value today?"" The answer to that question might just change everything.

Remember: in a world full of copies, being an original isn't just a gift‚Äîit's a responsibility. Your differences aren't mistakes to fix; they're features to celebrate and leverage.

The world is waiting for what only you can offer. The question isn't whether you're different enough‚Äîit's whether you're brave enough to let that difference shine.

Have you ever wondered why some people seem to effortlessly create the life they want while others remain stuck in patterns they desperately wish to change? The answer isn't found in luck, privilege, or secret formulas. It lies in understanding three fundamental elements that act as the bridge between where you are and where you want to be.

## The Reality Check We All Need ü™û

Let's be honest for a moment. Most of us have dreams, goals, and visions of a better tomorrow. We imagine ourselves healthier, wealthier, happier, or more fulfilled. Yet when we look at our current reality, there's often a significant gap between our aspirations and our actual circumstances.

This gap isn't a punishment or a sign of failure. It's simply the space where transformation happens. Think of it as the construction zone where your future self is being built, piece by piece, decision by decision.

## The First Key: Your Mental Framework üß†

Your mental framework is essentially how you perceive and interpret the world around you. It's the lens through which you view challenges, opportunities, setbacks, and successes. This internal operating system determines whether you see obstacles as roadblocks or stepping stones.

**Practical Daily Applications:**

**Morning Thought Audit** ‚òÄÔ∏è
Start each day by observing your first thoughts. Are they oriented toward possibilities or limitations? Instead of jumping straight into your phone or rushing into the day, take three minutes to consciously choose thoughts that support your goals.

**Reframe Exercise** üîÑ
When something doesn't go as planned, ask yourself: ""What can this teach me?"" or ""How might this redirect me toward something better?"" This isn't about forced positivity‚Äîit's about training your brain to look for useful information in every situation.

**Evidence Collection** üìù
Keep a simple note on your phone where you record daily evidence that you're capable of change and growth. Did you choose a healthier meal? Have a difficult conversation? Learn something new? These small acknowledgments rewire your brain to expect success rather than failure.

## The Second Key: Directed Attention üéØ

In our hyperconnected world, attention has become our most valuable currency. Where you consistently direct your attention literally shapes your reality. Your brain cannot effectively pursue multiple priorities simultaneously‚Äîit needs clear direction.

**Practical Daily Applications:**

**The One-Thing Morning** üì±
Before checking any device, identify the single most important task that will move you closer to your desired life. Complete this task first, even if it's just for 15 minutes. This practice trains your brain to prioritize what matters over what's urgent.

**Attention Inventory** ‚è∞
Set three random alarms throughout your day. When they go off, simply note what you're thinking about and what you're doing. This awareness exercise reveals where your attention actually goes versus where you think it goes.

**Environmental Design** üè†
Structure your physical environment to support your goals. If you want to read more, place books in visible locations and move your phone to another room. If you want to exercise, lay out your workout clothes the night before. Your environment should make good choices easier and poor choices harder.

**Digital Boundaries** üì≤
Create specific times for consuming information that doesn't directly serve your goals. This might mean checking news only once per day or setting specific hours for social media. Your attention is finite‚Äîguard it like the precious resource it is.

## The Third Key: Sustained Action üîÑ

Consistency isn't about perfection‚Äîit's about persistence. It's the compound interest of personal development. Small, consistent actions create exponential results over time, while sporadic intense efforts typically lead to burnout and abandonment.

**Practical Daily Applications:**

**The Two-Minute Rule** ‚è±Ô∏è
Identify actions that move you toward your goals and can be completed in two minutes or less. Do these immediately when you think of them. Reply to that important email, do ten push-ups, write one paragraph, make that phone call. These micro-actions build momentum and confidence.

**Progress Tracking** üìä
Create a simple daily check-in system. This doesn't need to be complex‚Äîeven a basic calendar with checkmarks works. The key is making your progress visible to yourself. What gets measured gets managed, and what gets celebrated gets repeated.

**Failure Recovery Protocol** üõ°Ô∏è
Develop a specific plan for getting back on track when you inevitably miss a day or make a poor choice. Instead of abandoning your efforts entirely, have a predetermined ""reset"" action that gets you back into your routine immediately. This might be a five-minute walk, reading one page, or doing one positive action for your goal.

**Weekly Reviews** üìÖ
Spend 10 minutes each Sunday reviewing the previous week and planning the next. What worked? What didn't? What adjustments need to be made? This regular recalibration prevents you from drifting off course without realizing it.

## The Synergy Effect: When All Three Align ‚ö°

The magic happens when these three elements work together. Your mental framework determines what you believe is possible. Your directed attention ensures you're working on the right things. Your consistency turns those small daily actions into life-changing results.

Consider Sarah, a marketing professional who felt stuck in her career. Her mental framework shifted when she stopped viewing her job as ""just paying bills"" and started seeing it as a training ground for her future business. She directed her attention to learning one new skill each month related to entrepreneurship. Her consistency showed up as dedicating 30 minutes each morning to building her side project before work.

Within two years, Sarah had transitioned from employee to successful business owner. The gap between her desired life and actual life closed not through dramatic changes, but through the steady application of these three principles.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them ‚ö†Ô∏è

**The Perfection Trap**
Many people abandon their efforts after the first mistake or missed day. Remember: consistency means getting back on track quickly, not never falling off track.

**The Comparison Game**
Your journey is unique. Someone else's timeline, methods, or results have no bearing on your potential for success. Focus on your own progress and trust your own process.

**The All-or-Nothing Approach**
Life happens. There will be days when you can only manage 10% of your usual effort. Ten percent is infinitely better than zero percent. Maintain forward momentum in whatever way possible.

**The Motivation Dependency**
Relying on motivation alone is like depending on the weather for transportation. Build systems and habits that work regardless of how you feel on any given day.

## Making It Sustainable for Life üå±

The most powerful aspect of these three keys is their sustainability. Unlike complex systems that require perfect conditions to work, this approach adapts to real life circumstances. Whether you're dealing with job changes, family responsibilities, health challenges, or simply the natural ebbs and flows of motivation, these principles remain applicable.

**Start Small, Think Big** üå∞
Begin with the smallest possible version of each element. Maybe your mental framework shift starts with one positive thought each morning. Perhaps your focus improvement begins with just ten minutes of distraction-free time. Your consistency might start with one tiny action per day. Small beginnings prevent overwhelm and build the confidence needed for bigger changes.

**Celebrate Small Wins** üéâ
Acknowledge every step forward, no matter how small it might seem. Each moment you choose growth over comfort, action over procrastination, or possibility over limitation, you're literally rewiring your brain for success. These celebrations aren't frivolous‚Äîthey're essential fuel for long-term change.

**Embrace the Process** üõ§Ô∏è
The gap between your current life and desired life isn't a problem to be solved quickly‚Äîit's a space to be experienced fully. Every day in this space is teaching you something valuable about yourself, about what you truly want, and about what you're capable of achieving.

## Your Daily Bridge-Building Toolkit üß∞

**Morning Questions** (2 minutes):
‚Ä¢ What kind of person am I becoming today?
‚Ä¢ What deserves my best attention today?
‚Ä¢ What one action will move me forward today?

**Evening Reflection** (2 minutes):
‚Ä¢ What did I learn about myself today?
‚Ä¢ How did I grow today, even in small ways?
‚Ä¢ What will I do tomorrow to continue building my bridge?

**Weekly Calibration** (10 minutes):
‚Ä¢ Am I moving in my intended direction?
‚Ä¢ What adjustments need to be made?
‚Ä¢ How can I make next week even better?

## The Ripple Effect: Beyond Personal Change üåä

As you consistently apply these three keys, something remarkable happens. Your transformation begins to positively impact every area of your life and everyone around you. Your improved mental framework helps you handle relationships more skillfully. Your better attention management makes you more present with family and friends. Your consistency demonstrates to others that change is possible.

You become living proof that the gap between dreaming and achieving can be bridged through simple, consistent application of timeless principles. This isn't about perfection or dramatic overnight changes‚Äîit's about steady, sustainable progress that compounds over time.

## The Long View: Building Something Lasting üèóÔ∏è

These three keys‚Äîyour mental framework, directed attention, and consistent action‚Äîcreate a foundation that supports growth throughout your entire life. Unlike quick fixes or trendy approaches, this method becomes stronger and more effective with time.

Twenty years from now, you'll still benefit from a growth-oriented mental framework. Fifty years from now, the ability to direct your attention skillfully will be even more valuable in whatever technological landscape exists. A hundred years from now, if humans live that long, the power of consistency will remain unchanged.

You're not just changing your current circumstances‚Äîyou're developing capacities that will serve you for decades to come. Every day you practice these keys, you're making deposits in an account that pays dividends for life.

## Your Bridge Starts Today üåÖ

The gap between your current life and your desired life isn't a chasm to leap across in a single bound. It's a bridge to be built, step by step, decision by decision, day by day. You have everything you need to begin construction right now.

Your mental framework is already operating‚Äîyou just need to become more conscious of it and gradually adjust it to support your goals. Your attention is already going somewhere‚Äîyou just need to become more intentional about directing it. You're already doing things consistently‚Äîyou just need to align those consistent actions with your desired outcomes.

The bridge to your dream life isn't built with perfect conditions, unlimited resources, or ideal timing. It's built with whatever materials you have available today, starting exactly where you are, with exactly what you have.

Your transformation doesn't require you to become someone completely different. It requires you to become more consciously and consistently yourself‚Äîthe version of yourself that makes choices aligned with your deepest values and highest aspirations.

The gap between where you are and where you want to be isn't a judgment on your worth or a prediction of your future. It's simply the space where your greatest growth and most meaningful achievements are waiting to unfold.

Your bridge starts with your next thought, your next choice, your next action. The life you want isn't just a distant dream‚Äîit's a daily practice, one decision at a time.

1n3zav6,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n3zav6/breaking_free_from_the_echo_chamber_why_your/,Breaking Free from the Echo Chamber: Why Your Circle Shapes Your Character üåü,"

Have you ever wondered why some people seem completely oblivious to their harmful behavior? Why they continue patterns that hurt others without batting an eye? The answer often lies not in their individual moral compass, but in something far more subtle yet powerful: the environment they've chosen to surround themselves with.

## The Mirror Effect of Our Social Circles ü™û

Picture this scenario: You walk into an office where everyone arrives late, takes extended lunch breaks, and openly complains about clients. A new employee joins this team. What do you think happens? Within weeks, they're likely adopting the same behaviors, not because they're inherently lazy or unprofessional, but because this has become their new normal.

This phenomenon extends far beyond workplace habits. When destructive patterns become the standard operating procedure in our social circles, our brain's natural tendency is to adapt and conform. We stop questioning behaviors that would have once made us uncomfortable because they've become background noise in our daily experience.

## The Comfort Zone of Collective Dysfunction üò¥

There's an odd comfort in shared dysfunction. When everyone around you handles stress by lashing out, avoids difficult conversations, or treats service workers poorly, these behaviors stop feeling problematic. They become just ""how things are done"" or ""how people naturally react.""

This collective blind spot creates a protective bubble where harmful actions get reframed as normal responses to life's challenges. The person who screams at their family during stressful times doesn't see it as abuse if their friends do the same. The individual who gossips destructively doesn't recognize the harm if it's the primary form of entertainment in their social group.

## The Power of Perspective Shift üîÑ

Here's where personal awareness becomes your superpower. When you step back and honestly examine your actions through fresh eyes, you begin to see patterns that were invisible before. This isn't about harsh self-judgment or guilt trips. It's about developing the courage to ask uncomfortable questions:

- Are my reactions helping or harming my relationships?
- Would I want to be treated the way I treat others during conflict?
- Are my daily choices moving me toward the person I want to become?

This kind of honest self-reflection can feel uncomfortable initially because it challenges the convenient narratives we've constructed about our behavior.

## Building Your Personal Quality Control System ‚öôÔ∏è

Think of developing awareness like installing a quality control system in your mind. Just as factories have checkpoints to catch defective products before they reach customers, you can create mental checkpoints that catch harmful patterns before they damage your relationships.

Start small with daily moments of pause. Before responding to frustration, take three seconds to consider your options. Before joining in negative conversations, ask yourself if this is how you want to spend your mental energy. Before making excuses for behavior that doesn't align with your values, pause and consider what a person you admire would do instead.

## The Ripple Effect of Conscious Choices üåä

When you begin making more intentional choices about your actions and reactions, something interesting happens. You naturally become less tolerant of environments that pull you toward your worst tendencies. You start gravitating toward people who challenge you to grow rather than enable your limitations.

This shift isn't always easy. Sometimes it means having difficult conversations with longtime friends about changing dynamics. Other times it means spending less time with people who consistently bring out negative patterns in your behavior.

## Practical Steps for Daily Implementation üìã

**Morning Intention Setting**: Before checking your phone or diving into daily tasks, spend two minutes considering what kind of energy you want to bring to your interactions today.

**The 24-Hour Rule**: When you feel triggered by someone's behavior, give yourself 24 hours before responding. This simple delay often provides enough space for your initial reaction to settle into a more thoughtful response.

**Weekly Relationship Audit**: Once a week, briefly review your recent interactions. Ask yourself: ""Did I show up as the person I want to be in my relationships this week?"" Notice patterns without judgment, then make small adjustments.

**Environment Evaluation**: Monthly, assess whether your regular environments (workplace, social groups, online communities) support or undermine your growth. Are you surrounding yourself with people who inspire better behavior or enable your worst habits?

## The Long-Term View üî≠

The beautiful thing about developing this kind of awareness is that it compounds over time. Small daily choices to pause, reflect, and choose better responses create momentum that builds into significant life changes. You become someone who naturally attracts healthier relationships and opportunities.

Years from now, you'll look back and realize that the decision to step outside your comfort zone and honestly examine your patterns was a turning point. Not because it led to perfection, but because it led to continuous growth and increasingly authentic connections with others.

## Breaking the Cycle for Future Generations üå±

When you choose to break negative patterns, you're not just improving your own life. You're creating a different example for everyone who interacts with you. Children who witness adults taking responsibility for their mistakes learn that accountability is normal. Friends who see you choosing growth over comfort are inspired to examine their own patterns.

This is how positive change spreads through communities, one conscious choice at a time. Your decision to develop awareness and surround yourself with people who support your growth becomes a gift that extends far beyond your immediate circle.

## The Freedom in Honest Self-Reflection üïäÔ∏è

There's tremendous freedom in admitting that some of our behaviors haven't been serving us well. This admission isn't a character flaw; it's the starting point for genuine transformation. When we stop defending patterns that aren't working, we create space for new, healthier approaches to emerge.

The goal isn't to become perfect but to become more conscious. Every moment offers a fresh opportunity to choose responses that align with who you're becoming rather than who you've been.

Remember, the people around you are mirrors reflecting back your own patterns and possibilities. Choose your mirrors wisely, and be willing to adjust when the reflection shows you something you're ready to change.

Your future self will thank you for the courage to look honestly at today's patterns and make different choices tomorrow.

Ease of use is important as she will be using it. For the grinder it has to be something with a hopper as she doesn‚Äôt want to measure anything out. I was thinking something that‚Äôs grind by weight to make us both happy. I think I‚Äôd like to move away from a Breville to something that‚Äôs a bit more quality feel and pleasant on the eye.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Coleman Wong vs. Andrey Rublev: A David vs. Goliath Showdown with a Side of ""Why Not?""**

Let‚Äôs cut to the chase: **Coleman Wong** is a 21-year-old Hong Kong qualifier ranked **173rd** who‚Äôs defied the odds to reach the US Open third round. **Andrey Rublev**, the 15th seed, is a former top-5 player with a game so smooth it could polish a diamond. Yet here we are, with Wong as a **9.0 underdog** (decimal odds) and Rublev a -106 favorite. Yes, the math says Rublev has a **94.3% implied chance to win**. But hey, *‚Äúmath doesn‚Äôt account for Hong Kong‚Äôs collective hopes being channeled into one 6‚Äô1‚Äù frame.‚Äù*

### The Stats That Make You Snort Coffee:

* **Wong‚Äôs Journey**: Beat #71 and #85 seeds. His coach‚Äôs advice? *‚ÄúJust go for it. Rublev melts down.‚Äù*
* **Rublev‚Äôs Weakness**: A ‚Äúlack of versatility‚Äù (thanks, coach Allemby). If Wong can exploit his backhand, maybe Rublev will forget how to serve.
* **Spread**: Wong is +6.5 games underdog. To cover, he‚Äôd need to win **at least 7 games more** than Rublev. *Spoiler: That‚Äôs basically asking Rublev to nap during the third set.*

### The Odds Breakdown:

* **Moneyline**: Rublev at **-106** (decimal 1.06), Wong at **+900** (decimal 9.0).
* **Spread**: Wong +6.5 at **+191**, Rublev -6.5 at \*\*-2

Has anyone else fallen down the ‚ÄúGet Paid to Click Captchas‚Äù rabbit hole lately? Because I just had a wild ride and feel like my brain got a software update. üëÄ

You know those TikToks where people say you can literally get paid just to click captchas for new apps? I thought it was a meme. Nope‚ÄîI‚Äôve now met ‚Äúapp testing gateways.‚Äù And I have QUESTIONS.

First of all: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**

Why do these sites look straight out of a science-fiction hacking movie?

- They claim it‚Äôs ‚Äúuser validation.‚Äù 
- You finish a task, then a suspiciously simple captcha pops up.
- Suddenly, they dangle P****ayment screenshots and testimonials in your face.

BUT HERE‚ÄôS THE KICKER: It‚Äôs all done through these bizarre ‚Äúgateways‚Äù that make you feel like you‚Äôre starring in Mr. Robot. Has anyone ACTUALLY gotten paid?

- I mean, someone break it down for me:

   - Do these apps even track your ‚Äúwork?‚Äù 
   - Where‚Äôs the money, Lebowski? 
   - Why does every ‚Äúsuccess story‚Äù send you back to **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**?

Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚ÄîI‚Äôm not anti-side hustle. I live for building income streams from my phone! But this? It‚Äôs too much:

- I spent 30 minutes on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**.
- All I did was chase an endless loop of simple tasks, captchas, and pop-ups about ‚Äúclaim your reward.‚Äù
- After all that, it still asks you to complete more ‚Äúoffers.‚Äù

Let‚Äôs be real:

- If these ‚Äúapp testing captchas‚Äù pay you, how much is it‚Äîone shiny dollar? A cent? 
- Is it all just data-harvesting wrapped in hype?

Anyone else think the ‚Äúgateways‚Äù just test how much patience you have before giving up?

Am I paranoid for thinking this is some weird IQ test? Or, like, maybe they‚Äôre using our clicks to train their bot armada, and we‚Äôre unpaid interns? üòÇ

Confused and surprised, for real!

If you‚Äôre reading this and thinking, ‚ÄúWAIT, maybe it‚Äôs legit‚Äù‚Äîplease, I NEED YOUR SUCCESS STORY. Show me that sweet payout receipt from **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**.

Otherwise, tell me: What‚Äôs the weirdest thing you‚Äôve ever done online for $5? Was it this? Am I alone on planet Captcha hell? üåçüì≤

We‚Äôre planning a trip to Bali this October (Oct 12‚Äì24) with our 2-year-old daughter. We‚Äôve already traveled quite a bit with her (Thailand, USA, Canada, Portugal), so we‚Äôre comfortable being on the move, but we still prefer a pace that balances exploration and downtime.

As travelers, we usually go for authentic experiences, small guesthouses, and local vibes over big resorts. We‚Äôre also hoping to¬†**avoid the super ‚ÄúInstagram-famous‚Äù spots**¬†(if we wanted long lines for a swing, we‚Äôd go to Disneyland üòâ).

Here‚Äôs the rough plan we‚Äôve put together, aiming for culture + nature + some beach time, while keeping things family-friendly:**Itinerary**

* **Oct 12‚Äì17: Ubud (5 nights)**
   * Rice terraces 
   * Temple visits 
   * Traditional dance performance 
   * A few slow days just enjoying the guesthouse/pool/markets
* **Oct 17‚Äì20: Munduk (3 nights)**
   * Guesthouse with mountain views
   * Coffee & spice plantations
   * Short hikes to waterfalls 
   * Twin Lakes viewpoints 
* **Oct 20‚Äì24: Final stop (4 nights)**We‚Äôre undecided between:
   * **Sanur**¬†
   * **Canggu**
   * **Nusa Lembongan**¬†‚Äì for the island vibe

**Questions:**

1. Does this look like a good balance (Ubud ‚Äì Munduk ‚Äì beach)?
2. With a toddler, what would you recommend for beach time ?
3. Any accommodation recommendations in these areas?

Picture this: You're in a meeting, and when tensions rise, one person suddenly becomes quiet, avoids eye contact, or finds urgent reasons to step away. Sound familiar? We've all encountered someone who seems to vanish the moment disagreement appears. Understanding and working effectively with conflict-avoiding individuals isn't just workplace psychology‚Äîit's a life skill that can transform your relationships everywhere.

## Understanding the Conflict Avoider's Mind üß†

Conflict avoiders aren't cowards or lazy team members. They're often highly sensitive individuals who experience disagreement as genuine stress. Their nervous systems may interpret raised voices or heated discussions as actual threats, triggering fight-or-flight responses that make them want to escape rather than engage.

These individuals often possess remarkable strengths: they're excellent listeners, natural mediators when tensions aren't directed at them, and frequently serve as the emotional thermostat of teams, sensing when group dynamics feel off before others notice.

## Early Warning Signs to Watch For üëÄ

Learning to identify conflict-avoidant behavior early prevents frustration and miscommunication. Look for these patterns:

**Verbal Indicators:**
- Frequent use of phrases like ""I don't know,"" ""maybe,"" or ""whatever you think is best""
- Sudden topic changes when discussions become intense
- Agreeing too quickly without offering genuine input
- Speaking in increasingly quiet tones during disagreements

**Physical Behaviors:**
- Stepping back or creating distance during heated moments
- Fidgeting, checking phones, or looking toward exits
- Crossed arms or other protective postures
- Difficulty maintaining eye contact during tense conversations

**Work Patterns:**
- Missing meetings where difficult decisions will be made
- Sending emails instead of having face-to-face conversations about problems
- Delaying responses to messages about contentious topics
- Taking on extra work rather than saying no directly

## The Foundation Strategy: Create Safety First üõ°Ô∏è

Before attempting any specific techniques, establish psychological safety. Conflict avoiders need to feel secure before they can contribute meaningfully to difficult conversations.

**Lower the Temperature:**
Start conversations in relaxed environments. Coffee shops often work better than conference rooms. Bright, open spaces feel safer than closed offices. Even your tone of voice matters‚Äîspeak slightly slower and softer than usual.

**Use ""We"" Language:**
Instead of ""You always avoid these discussions,"" try ""We seem to get stuck when these topics come up. How can we work through this together?"" This shifts from accusation to collaboration.

**Acknowledge Their Perspective:**
Say things like, ""I know these conversations can feel intense,"" or ""I appreciate that you prefer harmony in our team."" This validates their feelings without judgment.

## Practical Techniques That Actually Work ‚ö°

### The Preview Method
Give conflict avoiders advance notice about difficult conversations. Send a brief message like: ""Tomorrow's meeting will cover the budget concerns Sarah raised. I'd love your thoughts on the marketing allocation beforehand if you're comfortable sharing them.""

This allows them to process information privately and prepare responses without feeling ambushed.

### The Written Bridge Technique
Encourage initial responses through writing. Many conflict avoiders express themselves more clearly in text than in spontaneous verbal exchanges. Use collaborative documents, anonymous suggestion boxes, or even simple email exchanges to gather their input before group discussions.

### The Proxy Power Play
Sometimes conflict avoiders will share concerns privately but won't voice them publicly. With their permission, you can raise their points in group settings: ""Several team members mentioned concerns about the timeline. Let's discuss how we might address these.""

### The Options Approach
Instead of asking open-ended questions like ""What do you think we should do?"" provide specific alternatives: ""Would you prefer we tackle this project in two phases or extend the deadline by a week?"" This reduces anxiety by limiting choices and removing the pressure to generate solutions from scratch.

## Daily Life Applications üè†

**At Home:**
When planning family vacations, don't put conflict avoiders on the spot with ""Where should we go?"" Instead, research three options and ask, ""Which of these sounds most appealing to you?"" This works for everything from dinner choices to major decisions about home renovations.

**In Social Groups:**
When organizing group activities, send private messages to conflict-averse friends asking for input before group discussions. This ensures their preferences are considered without forcing them to advocate for themselves publicly.

**With Romantic Partners:**
Establish regular check-ins during calm moments rather than waiting for problems to escalate. Use phrases like, ""How are you feeling about our communication lately?"" instead of bringing up specific complaints during arguments.

## Advanced Strategies for Persistent Patterns üöÄ

### The Structured Disagreement Method
Create formal processes for handling disagreement that feel safe and predictable. This might involve:
- Setting specific times for difficult conversations
- Using written agendas that outline topics in advance  
- Implementing cooling-off periods between raising issues and discussing solutions
- Establishing ground rules that prohibit interrupting or raising voices

### The Strength-Based Assignment System
Assign conflict avoiders roles that leverage their natural abilities while gradually building their comfort with tension. They might excel at:
- Gathering information from all parties before decisions
- Following up on agreements after difficult conversations
- Facilitating discussions between others (when they're not directly involved)
- Documenting decisions and ensuring everyone understands outcomes

### The Gradual Exposure Approach
Like treating phobias, slowly increase conflict avoiders' comfort levels with disagreement. Start with low-stakes decisions where their input matters but consequences are minimal. Gradually progress to more significant issues as their confidence grows.

## What Not to Do: Common Mistakes to Avoid ‚ùå

**Never Force Direct Confrontation:**
Putting conflict avoiders on the spot during heated moments will likely cause them to shut down completely. They need time and space to process before contributing meaningfully.

**Don't Interpret Silence as Agreement:**
Just because someone doesn't argue doesn't mean they agree. Always circle back privately to confirm understanding and gather genuine input.

**Avoid Making It About Weakness:**
Phrases like ""You need to toughen up"" or ""It's just business"" dismiss their legitimate emotional experience. Their sensitivity often correlates with valuable interpersonal skills your team needs.

**Don't Enable Complete Avoidance:**
While respecting their style, ensure conflict avoiders still participate in necessary decisions. Find alternative ways for them to contribute rather than letting them disappear entirely.

## Building Long-Term Success üìà

Working effectively with conflict avoiders requires patience and consistency. These relationships improve gradually as trust develops. Focus on small victories‚Äîmoments when they share an opinion, ask a clarifying question, or stay present during a difficult conversation.

Celebrate these moments privately. A simple ""I really appreciated your perspective in today's discussion"" can reinforce positive behavior without making them uncomfortable with public attention.

## The Ripple Effect of Understanding üåä

When you successfully engage conflict avoiders, everyone benefits. Teams become more inclusive because quieter voices are heard. Decision-making improves because you're gathering input from different personality types. Overall group dynamics become healthier when everyone feels psychologically safe to participate.

These skills also make you a more effective leader, parent, friend, and partner. Understanding how different people process stress and disagreement helps you communicate more effectively across all relationships.

## Creating Your Personal Action Plan üìã

Start small with one conflict-averse person in your life. Choose someone whose avoidance pattern affects you regularly‚Äîa team member, family member, or close friend.

Begin by observing their specific triggers and responses. What topics do they avoid? What environments make them most comfortable? How do they prefer to communicate when stressed?

Then implement one technique consistently for several weeks. The preview method often provides the quickest results because it's easy to execute and immediately reduces their anxiety.

Track what works and what doesn't. Each conflict avoider is unique, so techniques that work brilliantly with one person might need modification for another.

## The Future-Proof Nature of These Skills üîÆ

Regardless of how technology evolves or workplace cultures shift, humans will always have different comfort levels with conflict and confrontation. These fundamental personality differences transcend cultural trends, generational changes, and technological advances.

Understanding how to work with diverse communication styles will remain valuable whether you're collaborating with artificial intelligence, managing virtual reality teams, or navigating relationships in ways we haven't yet imagined. The core principles‚Äîcreating safety, providing options, respecting different processing styles‚Äîwill adapt to any future context.

## Moving Forward with Confidence üí™

Remember that working with conflict avoiders isn't about changing them into aggressive communicators. It's about creating conditions where their natural strengths can emerge while ensuring important issues get addressed.

Every conflict avoider you encounter offers an opportunity to practice patience, creativity, and inclusive leadership. These interactions stretch your communication skills and make you more versatile in all your relationships.

The investment of time and energy required to understand conflict-averse individuals pays dividends far beyond any single conversation or decision. You're building skills that will serve you throughout your career and personal life, creating more harmonious relationships and more effective collaborations.

Start today with one small change in how you approach the conflict avoider in your life. Notice their response, adjust your approach, and watch how this seemingly simple shift can transform your most challenging relationships into sources of unexpected strength and insight.

1n3ywjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/laravel/comments/1n3ywjf/building_a_robust_field_type_system_for_custom/,Building a Robust Field Type System for Custom Fields v2,"**TL;DR**: Rebuilt the field type architecture from scratch to eliminate boilerplate, add intelligent automation, and provide graceful error handling. Went from 10+ required methods to a fluent configurator API that generates working code in 30 seconds.

# The Problem That Started It All

After maintaining 30+ field types for [Custom Fields](https://custom-fields.relaticle.com/v2/introduction) V1, I kept running into the same issues:

* **Massive boilerplate**: Every field type required implementing 10+ interface methods
* **Manual option handling**: Choice fields needed custom logic for user-defined vs built-in options
* **Fragile system**: Deleting a field type class would crash any page displaying those fields
* **Poor DX**: Creating new field types took hours of copy-paste-modify cycles

The breaking point came when I realized I was spending more time maintaining the field type system than building actual features.

# Design Principles

I established four core principles for the v2 rewrite:

# 1. Convention over Configuration

Smart defaults with clear escape hatches. The system should work perfectly out-of-the-box but allow customization when needed.

# 2. Composition over Inheritance

Instead of rigid abstract classes, use fluent configurators that compose behaviors. This prevents the ""deep inheritance hell"" problem.

# 3. Fail Gracefully

Production systems can't crash because a developer deleted a field type class. The system must degrade gracefully and continue functioning.

# 4. Generate Working Code, Not TODOs

Commands should create immediately functional code, not skeleton files full of placeholder comments.

# The Architecture

# Configurator Pattern

The biggest change was moving from interface-based to configurator-based field types:

https://preview.redd.it/plv16lxa25mf1.png?width=3680&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3511a3ee6c0b807ecf411f7a429ecb2e55d0f6e

The configurator approach:

* **Encodes best practices**: You can't accidentally create invalid configurations
* **Reduces cognitive load**: Method chaining makes relationships clear
* **Prevents mistakes**: Type-safe configuration with IDE support
* **Enables intelligent defaults**: Each configurator knows what makes sense for its data type

# Intelligent Feature Application

The real breakthrough was solving the closure component problem.

In v1, closure-based components were ""dumb"" - they only did what you explicitly coded. Class-based components got automatic option handling, validation, etc., but closures missed out.

V2's `ClosureFormAdapter` changed this

https://preview.redd.it/tozdx0r935mf1.png?width=3680&format=png&auto=webp&s=29f92867c1b360d9ec10a37a28909609f81a3e3f

Now developers can write simple closures and get all the advanced features automatically applied.

# Graceful Degradation

One of the biggest production issues was fields becoming ""orphaned"" when their field type classes were deleted or moved. The entire admin panel would crash with ""Class not found"" errors.

The solution was defensive filtering at the BaseBuilder level

https://preview.redd.it/jr5h0lp235mf1.png?width=3680&format=png&auto=webp&s=dab99889d373e70c906e806b4f568e9a9f218adb

This single change made the entire system bulletproof against field type deletion.

# The withoutUserOptions() Design

This was the trickiest design decision. Initially, I thought:

* Single choice = built-in options
* Multi choice = user-defined options

But real-world usage broke this assumption. Users needed:

* Single choice with user-defined options (custom status fields)
* Multi choice with built-in options (skill level checkboxes)
* Both types with database-driven options (country selectors, tag systems)

The solution was making `withoutUserOptions()` orthogonal to choice type. It controls **WHO** manages the options, not **HOW MANY** can be selected:

https://preview.redd.it/wix7obsl25mf1.png?width=3680&format=png&auto=webp&s=837733e2b43b175abe0a028e901e5d8ebe1dbb92

This single flag unlocked infinite flexibility while keeping the API simple.

# Interactive Generation

The generation command showcases the philosophy:

https://preview.redd.it/nxlq3r2o25mf1.png?width=3680&format=png&auto=webp&s=1273d65cc368e40c8712c396f9ca92ab6934dbcd

The interactive prompt shows data type descriptions:

* **String** \- Short text, identifiers, URLs (max 255 chars)
* **Single Choice** \- Select dropdown, radio buttons
* **Multi Choice** \- Multiple selections, checkboxes, tags
* etc.

Each selection generates the appropriate:

* Configurator method (`text()`, `singleChoice()`, `numeric()`)
* Form component (`TextInput`, `Select`, `CheckboxList`)
* Smart defaults (validation rules, capabilities)

# Real-World Impact

# For Package Maintainers

* **90% less boilerplate**: field types went from \~200 lines each to \~50 lines
* **Consistent behavior**: Shared configurators eliminated behavioral drift between field types
* **Bulletproof error handling**: No more production crashes from missing field types

# For Package Users

* **30-second field type creation**: Generate ‚Üí customize ‚Üí register ‚Üí done
* **Automatic feature application**: Write simple closures, get advanced features
* **Clear extension patterns**: The configurator API guides you toward best practices

# The Philosophy

The best APIs are the ones that get out of your way. They should:

* **Make easy things trivial** (basic field types)
* **Make complex things possible** (dynamic database options)
* **Make wrong things difficult** (invalid configurations)
* **Make debugging obvious** (clear error messages and graceful degradation)

This field type system achieves all four by being opinionated about structure while flexible about implementation.

# Key Takeaways

1. **Fluent APIs reduce cognitive load** \- Method chaining makes relationships obvious
2. **Automatic feature application** \- Systems should be smart enough to apply features without explicit configuration
3. **Defensive programming pays off** \- Always assume things will be deleted, moved, or broken
4. **Generation > Templates** \- Create working code, not skeletons
5. **Orthogonal design decisions** \- `withoutUserOptions()` works with any choice type because it solves a different problem

Building developer tools is about eliminating friction while maintaining power. This field type system does both.

I did kwiziq quiz recently and have been placed at A1 level. Don‚Äôt think I will subscribe as the cost is too high.

I also started Anki 5000 most common words deck but find that super boring and unrelated words and words are just chucked at you without context and found it difficult to remember. But I do like the fact that there is IPA pronunciation so it helps.

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age.

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful.

Hey guys,

 I‚Äôve recently launched a Substack newsletter called¬†*The Daily Edge for Man*‚Äîa space dedicated to helping men sharpen their mindset, stay grounded, and build momentum in everyday life.

It‚Äôs not about hustle culture or toxic positivity. It‚Äôs about real, practical insights that help you show up stronger‚Äîfor yourself, your family, and your goals. Each post is short, actionable, and designed to give you a mental edge without the fluff.

Topics include:

* Morning mindset resets
* Navigating stress and self-doubt
* Building habits that actually stick
* Motivation that doesn‚Äôt feel cheesy

If you‚Äôre into personal growth, mental clarity, or want a solid read with your morning coffee, check it out. I‚Äôd love your feedback or ideas for future posts.

Let‚Äôs build something strong together.

I don‚Äôt feel the same way about him in fact, I see him more like a younger brother (he‚Äôs a year younger than me). I don‚Äôt usually hang out with boys at uni, and whenever they make plans for lunch or dinner, I politely decline to keep my boundaries clear. This guy, though, texts me every other day asking to grab coffee or hang out. I always make up an excuse because I don‚Äôt want things to get awkward. I even told him directly once not to expect me to hang out like that. The thing is, I know he likes me, and I don‚Äôt want to give him false hope. It wouldn‚Äôt be fair. Now that we‚Äôre on summer break, he‚Äôs been sending me reels that clearly have a flirty vibe or hint that he likes me.

1n3yg5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n3yg5r/the_power_of_repeatable_success_why_building/,The Power of Repeatable Success: Why Building Systems Beats Setting Goals,"

Ever wondered why some people seem to effortlessly achieve success after success, while others struggle to maintain momentum even after reaching their targets? The answer lies in understanding a fundamental difference between two approaches to achievement: the goal-oriented mindset versus the system-oriented mindset.

## üéØ The One-Time Winner vs. The Consistent Champion

Picture this: You decide you want to lose 20 pounds. You set this as your goal, work hard for months, and finally achieve it. Celebration time! But then what? Without a sustainable framework in place, many people find themselves gradually returning to old habits, eventually gaining the weight back.

Now imagine a different approach. Instead of fixating on the 20-pound target, you focus on building a system of healthy daily habits: walking for 30 minutes each morning, preparing nutritious meals on Sundays, drinking water before each meal, and getting 7-8 hours of sleep nightly. 

The difference? The first approach celebrates a single victory. The second creates a foundation for lifelong success.

## üîÑ Understanding the Systems Advantage

Systems thinking transforms how we approach improvement in every area of life. Rather than banking everything on achieving a specific outcome, we concentrate on perfecting the process that naturally leads to desired results.

### Why Goals Can Actually Hold You Back

**The Motivation Trap**: Goals depend heavily on motivation, which naturally fluctuates. When enthusiasm wanes, progress stops. Systems, however, run on habits and processes that function regardless of how motivated you feel on any given day.

**The Plateau Problem**: Once you reach a goal, there's often an unconscious relaxation. You've ""made it,"" so why keep pushing? This leads to backsliding and the frustrating cycle of achieving and losing the same results repeatedly.

**The Pressure Paradox**: Goals can create anxiety and stress, especially when progress seems slow. This pressure can actually inhibit performance and decision-making, creating the opposite effect of what you intended.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building Your Success Systems

The beauty of systems lies in their adaptability and compound effects. Here's how to implement this thinking in various aspects of your daily life:

### üíº Professional Development

Instead of setting a goal to ""get promoted within two years,"" build a system around continuous improvement:

- Dedicate 20 minutes each morning to learning industry-relevant skills
- Schedule monthly coffee meetings with colleagues from different departments
- Keep a weekly journal documenting challenges overcome and lessons learned
- Volunteer for one cross-functional project each quarter

This system doesn't just aim for one promotion‚Äîit creates a pattern of growth that leads to ongoing career advancement throughout your professional life.

### üí∞ Financial Wellness

Rather than setting a goal to ""save $10,000 by year-end,"" create a financial system:

- Automatically transfer 20% of each paycheck to savings before you see it
- Review and categorize all expenses every Sunday evening
- Research and implement one new cost-saving measure monthly
- Spend 15 minutes weekly learning about personal finance through podcasts or articles

This approach doesn't just help you save once‚Äîit builds wealth-building habits that compound over decades.

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Health and Fitness

Move beyond ""run a marathon by December"" to establishing a fitness system:

- Take a 10-minute walk after each meal
- Prepare healthy snacks every Sunday for the upcoming week
- Choose stairs over elevators whenever possible
- Replace one processed food item with a whole food alternative each week

These habits create lasting health improvements that extend far beyond any single fitness achievement.

### üìö Knowledge and Skills

Transform ""read 50 books this year"" into a learning system:

- Read for 15 minutes every morning with your coffee
- Listen to educational podcasts during commutes
- Join or create a monthly discussion group around topics that interest you
- Apply one new concept from your reading to a real-life situation each week

This creates a lifelong learning habit that continuously expands your capabilities and perspective.

## ‚öôÔ∏è The Mechanics of Effective Systems

### Start Small, Think Big

The most sustainable systems begin with actions so small they feel almost trivial. Want to build a reading habit? Start with one page per day. Interested in meditation? Begin with two minutes of quiet breathing. These micro-habits create momentum without overwhelming your existing routine.

### Focus on Consistency Over Intensity

A 15-minute daily walk beats a 3-hour weekend hike when it comes to building long-term fitness habits. Consistency trains your brain to accept new behaviors as normal parts of your routine, while sporadic intense efforts often lead to burnout and abandonment.

### Design for Your Real Life

Effective systems account for your actual schedule, energy levels, and constraints‚Äînot an idealized version of your life. If you're not a morning person, don't build a system that requires 5 AM wake-ups. Work with your natural rhythms and existing commitments.

### Build in Flexibility

Life happens. Good systems include built-in adaptability. Maybe your daily 30-minute workout becomes a 10-minute stretch session when you're traveling, or your weekly meal prep becomes picking up pre-cut vegetables when work gets crazy. The key is maintaining the pattern, even if the specific actions vary.

## üé™ Systems in Action: Real-Life Examples

### The Writer's Daily Practice

Instead of aiming to ""write a novel,"" many successful authors build a daily writing system: 500 words each morning before checking email, regardless of quality or inspiration level. This system produces not just one book, but often multiple books over time, along with improved writing skills and creative thinking.

### The Networker's Monthly Coffee

Rather than setting a goal to ""expand professional network,"" some people create a system of reaching out to one new professional contact monthly and scheduling a brief coffee chat. Over time, this builds a robust network naturally, without the pressure of immediate outcomes.

### The Investor's Weekly Habit

Instead of trying to ""make money in the stock market,"" successful long-term investors often follow a system: investing a fixed amount weekly regardless of market conditions, spending one hour monthly reviewing their portfolio, and annually rebalancing their investments. This approach leverages time and compound growth rather than trying to time the market.

## üöÄ Making the Mental Shift

Transitioning from goal-focused to system-focused thinking requires a fundamental shift in how you measure success and progress.

### Celebrate Process Wins

Instead of waiting for outcome-based victories, acknowledge and celebrate consistency in your systems. Completed your morning routine for seven straight days? That's worth celebrating. Stuck to your learning system for a month? Recognize that achievement.

### Measure Leading Indicators

Focus on metrics that predict future success rather than just tracking end results. If you're building a health system, track days you prepared healthy meals rather than just weight loss. If you're developing professionally, measure skills practiced rather than just promotions received.

### Embrace Patience

Systems thinking requires a longer-term perspective. Results might not be immediately visible, but the compound effects of consistent action create exponential improvements over time. This patience actually reduces stress because you're not constantly evaluating whether you're ""winning"" or ""losing.""

## üåü The Compound Effect of Systems

The true power of systems becomes apparent over extended periods. Each day of following your system builds upon the previous day, creating compound improvements that far exceed what any single goal achievement could provide.

Consider someone who builds a system around personal finance: saving 15% of income, learning about investments for 20 minutes weekly, and reviewing expenses monthly. After five years, they haven't just reached one financial goal‚Äîthey've developed expertise, built wealth, and created habits that will continue generating benefits for decades.

Compare this to someone who sets a goal to save $5,000 in one year, achieves it, celebrates, then returns to previous spending patterns. The first person creates lasting change; the second achieves temporary success.

## üé≠ Addressing Common Concerns

### ""But Don't I Need Specific Targets?""

Systems can absolutely include specific milestones‚Äîthey're just not the primary focus. Think of these targets as check-in points that help you evaluate and adjust your system rather than ultimate destinations. If your fitness system isn't moving you toward improved health markers, you refine the system rather than abandoning it.

### ""This Seems Slower Than Goal-Setting""

Initially, yes. Systems often produce results more gradually than intense goal-focused efforts. However, they also tend to produce more sustainable and ultimately more impressive long-term outcomes. The person who builds strong systems often surpasses the achievements of goal-setters within a few years while maintaining those results permanently.

### ""How Do I Stay Motivated?""

This question reveals the beauty of systems‚Äîthey're designed to function without relying on motivation. By building habits and processes, you reduce the mental energy required to maintain positive behaviors. The system becomes part of your identity and routine, running almost automatically.

## üí° Practical Implementation Steps

### Week 1: Audit Your Current Approach
- List your current goals in different life areas
- Identify which ones you've achieved and later lost
- Notice patterns in your motivation and consistency

### Week 2: Choose One Area for System Building
- Select the life area where improved consistency would have the biggest impact
- Identify the smallest daily or weekly action that would contribute to improvement
- Design this action to fit naturally into your existing routine

### Week 3: Start Your First System
- Begin your chosen micro-habit
- Track consistency rather than outcomes
- Notice how it feels different from goal-focused efforts

### Week 4: Refine and Expand
- Adjust your system based on what you've learned
- Consider adding a complementary habit
- Begin thinking about systems for other life areas

## üéØ The Long-Term Vision

Imagine yourself five years from now, having consistently followed well-designed systems rather than chasing individual goals. You've become someone who naturally maintains excellent health because healthy choices are simply part of your routine. Your skills and knowledge have grown exponentially because learning is woven into your daily life. Your relationships are stronger because you've systematically invested time and attention in them. Your finances reflect years of consistent, intelligent decisions rather than sporadic efforts.

This isn't fantasy‚Äîit's the predictable outcome of choosing systems over goals.

## üîÆ The Timeless Truth

The distinction between goals and systems isn't new, though our fast-paced world often obscures this wisdom. Ancient philosophers understood that character is built through daily practice, not singular achievements. Master craftspeople knew that excellence comes from perfecting process, not from completing projects.

This principle will remain relevant centuries from now because it's based on fundamental aspects of how humans learn, grow, and maintain positive changes. Technology may evolve, society may transform, but the power of consistent, well-designed systems to create lasting improvement will endure.

## üéâ Your Systems Journey Begins Today

The most beautiful aspect of adopting systems thinking is that you can start immediately, with whatever you have, wherever you are. You don't need perfect conditions, extensive resources, or complete clarity about the future. You just need to choose one small, positive action and commit to repeating it consistently.

Remember: you're not trying to win once and stop. You're building the capacity to succeed repeatedly, in ways that compound and strengthen over time. This approach transforms not just what you achieve, but who you become in the process.

The choice is yours: pursue the temporary satisfaction of goal achievement, or build the foundation for a lifetime of continuous growth and success. One path celebrates reaching the destination; the other ensures you keep moving toward ever-greater heights.

Which approach will you choose for your journey ahead? üöÄ

I then have a professional services business that rents from the LLC.

About 2000 sq feet of the office is under-utilized and is fully set-up with 10 cubical desks, 4 hot desks and 2 private offices. We are planning on opening a co-working hub with the under-used space. We have pin based keyless systems on the exterior doors (ability to provide temp, time based access), easy parking, a guest wi-fi system, monitors in all the work stations, a single serve fancy coffee machine that can do coffee, tea, expresso, etc. 

My gut says the co-working space could lower the operating cost of my professional services firm by covering most of what it pays in rent to the real estate LLC, and maybe even utilities and consumables. My COO is concerned it will be distracting to our billable staff as there is no way to close off the co-working area as the bathrooms and kitchen are on the side with the firm. 

Has anyone done something similar? What are the pros and cons of converting half of our office into co-working? My goal is to get beta testers in for 6 months at a reduced rate so we can test the concept before getting aggressive. 

My research shows comparable set-ups in the area are charging $300/month + for unassigned seating and those are downtown spaces where parking is limited/expensive. ",1,1756550477.0,CoWorking,0,1.0,False

We split our stay between an Airbnb in Canmore and the Fairmont Lake Louise. We had visited Banff before (September 2023, during larch season), but coming back in summer was a whole new experience.

The Airbnb we stayed in Canmore was in Spring Creek - a great spot to stay in. Walking distance into the centre, amazing views outside the building and walking distance to Beamers (new fav coffee spot). Fairmont Lake Louise was also a dream. Upon arrival we were informed that they had upgraded us to a Lake view room which was amazing - still can't get over that view!

The weather was perfect. We had blue skies and warm sunshine every day. That meant we could take a dip in Lake Louise (very cold but amazing!), go paddle boarding in Canmore and eat outside every evening. The area was busier for sure but didn't impact our trip in anyway, I just made sure to book restaurants for dinner in advance!

We also visited Kootenay National Park and Golden Skybridge (zipline, coaster and skybridge).

Now back in England and we‚Äôre already desperate to return. The Canadian Rockies has our hearts and I'd do anything to go back!!!

**Other than hikes, the activities we did included:**

* Cycling Banff golf course loop
* Paddle boarding
* Bow River float tour
* Polar plunge in Lake Louise
* Canoeing
* Canmore golf driving range
* Golden skybridge, zip line and mountain coster
* Cycling Canmore to Banff (Banff Legacy Trail)

**P.S restaurants we visited and recommend include:**

*Canmore*

* Rocky Bagel Mountain Company
* Bridgette Bar
* The Wood Restaurant and Lounge

*Banff*

* Nourish Bistro
* Bluebird

No manual UI coding required - go from Figma design to functional Rust UI in seconds!

¬†

**Usage Guide**

How Button Detection Works

The plugin automatically detects elements as buttons if their name:

    Ends with .button (e.g., ""Play.button"")
    Contains ""button"" anywhere (e.g., ""PlayButton"")
    Contains ""btn"" anywhere (e.g., ""menu_btn"")

**Button Types**

Text Buttons: Text elements with button names become transparent clickable buttons

Visual Button Groups: Groups/frames with button names export as PNG backgrounds with invisible clickable overlays

¬†

¬†**Requirements & Dependencies**

1. ImageLibrary Plugin (Recommended)

Install ImageLibrary on your Rust server for better performance:

* Faster image loading
* Memory caching
* Better server optimization

1. PNG Hosting (Required)

You must upload exported PNG files to a publicly accessible location:

* Web server (recommended):¬†[http://yourserver.com/ui-images/](http://yourserver.com/ui-images/)
* Dropbox public links:¬†https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/...
* GitHub Pages/CDN:¬†https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/...
* Local server (testing):¬†[http://localhost/images/](http://localhost/images/)

¬†

I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about how overwhelming ‚Äúdiet advice‚Äù can be ‚Äî keto, vegan, intermittent fasting, paleo, whole foods, supplements‚Ä¶the list never ends. But sometimes it‚Äôs the *simplest changes* that end up making the biggest impact.

For me, it was **cutting out sugary drinks**. I didn‚Äôt realise how much soda and packaged juice were draining my energy (and adding empty calories) until I switched to just water, herbal tea, and the occasional black coffee. Within a couple of weeks, I felt less bloated, slept better, and even noticed my skin clearing up. That one tiny shift felt way more doable than an entire ‚Äúdiet plan.‚Äù

So I‚Äôm curious:  
üëâ What‚Äôs one *small, sustainable diet change* that‚Äôs made a noticeable difference for you ‚Äî energy, mood, sleep, fitness, or just overall health?  
üëâ Bonus: Did it stick long-term, or did you eventually go back to old habits?

Would love to hear everyone‚Äôs experiences ‚Äî might inspire some easy swaps for those of us trying to improve our nutrition without going overboard. üå±",1,1756550100.0,u_Future-Process-8450,0,1.0,False

Me and my friend are based in Abu Dhabi and we‚Äôve been dreaming of starting a book club, 
and we‚Äôd love to find fellow readers to join us!

We‚Äôre imagining cozy, engaging meetups where we:
‚ú® Share our thoughts on books (from classics to contemporary, fiction or non-fiction)
‚ú® Exchange recommendations and hidden gems
‚ú® Have relaxed conversations over coffee/tea (and maybe snacks üëÄ)
‚ú® Build a little community of book lovers right here in the UAE

We‚Äôre flexible on how it shapes up, whether that‚Äôs monthly meetups, themed reads, or even a mix of in-person and online discussions.

If you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs been wanting to read more, discover new authors, or just geek out over books with like-minded people, drop a comment or DM. Let‚Äôs make this a space for stories, ideas, and friendships.

üìç Location: Abu Dhabi (but open to people from nearby too!)
