It's been 3 months since the last update and honestly, time flies so fast! But I'm back with what I think is the biggest interface overhaul City Game Studio has ever seen. Version 1.23.0 just dropped and I'm genuinely excited about this one.

**What's new?**

The mod system got a complete makeover. Loading is faster, more stable, and now you get these neat color-coded seals that tell you exactly what a mod does to your game. Blue means it improves your experience, yellow means it helps but breaks balance, and red... well, red means run! I spent way too much time on this but mod creators finally have proper feedback on what their mods actually do to the game.

Staff management was completely rebuilt from scratch. You can now select employees across multiple pages, transfer them between studios with a few clicks, and HR can actually balance your studios automatically. It's one of those ""why didn't I do this sooner"" moments.

The interface itself got a major facelift - everything from game creation to console management is more colorful and intuitive. I even hand-drew all the console icons because why not add some nostalgic flair, right?

https://i.redd.it/ellw77qzr79f1.gif

Save files now use compression (finally!), so listing your games is much faster. Plus threading for loading means no more coffee breaks while waiting for your save to open.

Oh, and there's this completely ""useless but essential"" company summary panel that shows all your achievements, best-selling games, and random stats. It's the kind of feature that sounds boring but you'll probably spend way too much time looking at.

**What's coming next?**

v1.24 is going to be all about competitors, and they're getting mean. I'm reworking their difficulty system - they'll be more aggressive, flood the market based on game difficulty, and some might even undercut your game engine prices just to mess with you. There's also this annoying bug where new competitors can be bought for $0 that I really need to fix!

The next update is actually scheduled for September 17, 2025. I'm dropping the date early because there's a special event planned, but I'm keeping that under wraps for now üòâ

If you've been on the fence about City Game Studio, this update really does make everything feel fresh. Managing multiple studios while competitors try to destroy your empire has never felt this smooth.

Whatever happened in the past three years, bury it and forget it, got it? Don't think being the daughter of duke's estate means someone's going to back you up!""

""There never was anyone before, and there sure won't be in the future."" Athena Monson's face was expressionless, her voice hollow. She nodded meekly, not daring to defy the steward.

Leaning against the wall for support, she slowly made her way out of the camp.

She had once lit up Pidence City with her dazzling dance. Now her knees, ruined from years of injury, could barely hold her weight. Without medicine, even her skill in healing was useless.

Just outside the camp, she heard someone call her name. Flinching, she lifted her head hesitantly.

What met her eyes was a majestic steed, a royal gift, and astride it sat the Marquis of Somers‚ÄîMichael Osborne. The famed war god himself.

He sat tall and poised, broad shoulders tapering to a lean waist, his face strikingly handsome. He still carried that same air of noble elegance.

This was the man she had loved for three long years. She had seen this scene in her dreams countless times‚Äîhim finally coming to take her home.

Her eyes filled with tears, and she opened her mouth to speak, but no words came.

Because it was him‚Äîhe was the one who had thrown her into this hellish camp, ordering others to ""teach her a lesson.""

The cold indifference in his eyes made her already shattered heart tremble again.

""I can take you home,"" Michael said, looking down at her from his horse, eyes like ice, his tone as sharp as a blade. ""But tell me‚Äîdo you finally admit you were wrong?

""If you hadn't poisoned the pastries back then, Willow wouldn't be living with a chronic illness. She still needs daily medicine. You only suffered three years of punishment‚Äîshe'll suffer for the rest of her life. You owe her forever!""

When Athena remained silent, Michael snapped, ""Answer me! Do you admit your guilt?""

The sudden sharpness in his voice made her jump. Reflexively, she shut her eyes, wrapped her arms around her head, and crouched down, crying out, ""I admit it! I was wrong! I'll never do it again!""

But the lash she expected never came. Only then did she remember‚Äîhe was the Marquis of Somers. A man like him would never lower himself to beat someone like her.

Still, she truly had been wrong. She was wrong to care. Wrong to love. Wrong to give her heart to people who treated it like nothing.

When she'd first been thrown into the camp, she still clung to a shred of hope.

She had thought, 'My fianc√© can't really be that heartless. He has protected me since our engagement‚Äîrisking his life, even, to spare me from harm.

'And my parents in the duke's estate‚Äîsurely, they would come for me. I have been framed.'

But she waited. And waited. And what came instead was nothing but torment‚Äîmerciless, day after day, at the hands of the soldiers.

She was a noblewoman, not a camp whore. They didn't dare touch her, which only made them more creative in how they broke her.

Sometimes, they beat her with slender whips made specifically for disciplining women‚Äîtools that cut deep and left her flesh in tatters. Other times, they stripped her naked and tossed her into the snow.

They were waiting for her to beg. To give in. To offer her body in exchange for a bite of food or a few days of peace.

But she never did. So their torment grew nastier, more degrading, every time.

Eventually, she stopped fighting back‚Äînot out of obedience, but because she no longer had the strength to resist.

""Athena, what game are you playing now?"" Michael frowned, his tone sharp with disdain.

He wondered, 'Three years of discipline, and she's ended up this pathetic?'

The once-glowing beauty of her face was gone‚Äînow it was sickly pale and hollow. Her waist, once soft and full, had thinned so much it looked like it might snap under a strong breeze.

He thought, 'Trying to act pitiful? I am not falling for it. I personally ordered my men to take good care of her. There is no way she's truly been mistreated.'

Turning away, Michael dismounted. He reached out a hand toward her. ""Get in the carriage.""

But she recoiled like a wounded animal, clutching her head, eyes blank, voice trembling as she pleaded, ""No‚Ä¶ please don't‚Ä¶ don't touch me‚Ä¶""

""That's enough,"" he snapped. ""Still pretending to be pitiful?""

His voice turned colder. ""What, is this your way of making me feel guilty?""

Athena slowly came back to herself. Her voice was dry, hoarse. She gave a hollow laugh, laced with self-mockery.

In front of Michael‚Äîor her parents‚Äîshe had never once had the right to feel wronged.

If they'd ever truly felt guilty, they wouldn't have waited until now.

Thirteen years ago, her birth parents finally brought her home to the duke's estate. That was when she found out the truth‚Äîshe'd been swapped at birth.

The greedy couple who raised her had traded her away and left her to suffer five bitter years.

She'd thought that returning to her real family meant love and acceptance. But what she got instead was coldness.

Her parents and brothers barely looked at her.

Whenever Willow Monson‚Äîthe girl who'd lived her life‚Äîfelt sad or neglected, they rushed to comfort her, as if she were the real daughter.

Little by little, Athena was pushed aside.

They constantly reminded her, ""You're the older sister. You should be the mature one. Be patient with Willow. Don't fight. Don't compete.""

Wanting so desperately to belong, Athena did as she was told. She gave way in everything, always stepping aside for Willow.

Three years ago, she even made pastries by hand to try to please her.

But Willow ended up poisoned‚Äîvomiting blood.

Their parents were furious. They said Athena's years away had corrupted her to the bone. Said she wasn't worthy of being their daughter.

Egged on by Willow's whispers, they decided to send her away‚Äîbanished from Pidence City forever.

Even the brothers who once adored her said, ""Willow might've enjoyed your life for over a decade, but she's innocent. How could you use such cruel tactics just to win attention? We don't have a sister as heartless as you!""

No matter how Athena tried to explain, no one believed her. Not once.

The moment Willow shed a tear, the blame fell on Athena.

In the end, it was Michael who stepped in to stop them from sending her away.

But he didn't save her. He simply had her quietly dumped in the military camp‚Äîbelieving that after enough suffering, she'd finally learn her place.

A gust of wind lifted the tangled strands of Athena's hair, revealing her emaciated, unrecognizable face.

Michael scowled. ""Get up. We're going back to the estate.""

Athena tried, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she crumpled to the ground again.

Michael turned back, his eyes flashing cold steel. ""If you'd rather not go back‚Ä¶ then drag yourself back into that camp.""

# 2.Chapter 2 Realize Your Mistake?

Athena lowered her gaze, gritted her teeth, and forced herself to stand. She didn't say a word as she clumsily climbed into the carriage, using both hands and knees.

Her legs throbbed with pain, barely able to hold her, and she looked completely wretched.

Michael turned away, refusing to watch. He had assumed three years of punishment would be enough to wear down her spirit, but the moment they met again, she was already trying to play the victim‚Äîputting on a show to win his sympathy.

If it hadn't been for that person's orders, he wouldn't have come for her at all.

What baffled him was why someone of such high rank would even notice Athena‚Äîlet alone give an order about her the moment he returned to Pidence City.

Michael was the first to get out of the carriage. Without a glance back, he instructed his men, ""I have business back at camp. After you drop her off, get rid of the carriage‚ÄîI don't want to see it again. It's filthy.""

Filthy. The word hit her like a slap. Athena's chest ached with a dull, sinking pain. She sniffed quietly, face devoid of emotion, and stepped down from the carriage.

Outside the towering red gates of the duke's estate, a woman was already waiting. The moment she saw Athena, she rushed over, eyes full of urgency.

But the first thing she said was, ""My sweet daughter, it's been three years. Have you finally realized your mistake?""

""I have,"" Athena replied flatly.

Her mistake had been wanting love too much. This time, she would sever those ties‚Äîfor good. Just‚Ä¶ not yet. Not while Margaret Monson, her grandmother, still needed her care.

Eloise Monson looked at Athena, her daughter‚Äîso thin and pale, her eyes distant‚Äîand her expression faltered.

Three years of hardship had changed Athena completely. Just one look was enough to make her heart ache.

No matter how deeply Athena had erred, she was still her daughter‚Äîstill her flesh and blood. And she had clearly paid the price.

""It's good you understand now,"" Eloise said softly. ""You mustn't be so willful again. Come on, get up."" She reached out to help.

But Athena immediately stood up on her own and took a step back, putting distance between them. Her eyes were guarded, cautious.

Eloise's heart twisted. ""You blame me for being too harsh? But I did it for your own good‚Äîfor your future! What mother doesn't want the best for her child?""

Her eyes turned red, her voice trembling with a hint of tears. ""Don't hold it against me‚Ä¶""

Her face was full of sorrow, as though she were the one who'd suffered for three years.

Athena stood there, unmoved, making no effort to bridge the gap between them.

Just then, a slender figure stepped gracefully out of the manor and gently supported Eloise's arm.

""Mother, Athena's just come home. She's probably overwhelmed. Don't be upset if she seems distant‚Äîgive her a little time, all right?""

The girl was delicate and fair, with porcelain skin and a sweet, innocent smile.

She turned to Athena and extended her hand, her eyes wide with sincerity. ""Athena, I don't hold anything against you. Let's forget the past, okay? We're still family‚Äîwe should love each other, just like before.""

Her smile was as gentle and harmless as ever.

Athena almost laughed out loud. After everything she'd endured, she wondered, 'Do they really think a few nice words can just wipe it all away?'

""Love? Between you and me?"" Disgust flickered in her eyes.

That was when someone finally lost patience.

""Willow's already gone out of her way to be kind to you, and you're still acting like this? What's wrong with your attitude?""

Nicolas Monson had just come from court, still in his crimson official robes. He swung off his horse and walked over, clearly irritated.

""You think you're the only one who's suffered these past three years? Do you have any idea what Mother's been through? She's lost sleep night after night, her hair's turning white!

""If it weren't for Willow taking care of her and fulfilling your duties, who knows what would've happened?""

Nicolas had seen the whole scene earlier‚ÄîEloise's joy quickly deflated, Willow's soft voice met with Athena's cold rejection.

Nicolas thought, 'And all because of three years of punishment? What right does she have to act wronged? Willow almost died.'

Eloise frowned at Nicolas, her son, clearly disapproving. ""Don't exaggerate. She just got back. As her big brother, you should be gentler with her. Don't scare her.""

""Mother, you don't need to defend her. The Monson family owes her nothing. She's the one who made the mistake. And because of her, our entire household's reputation suffered.

""Everyone in Pidence City knows the Duke's family raised a vicious, manipulative girl. And Willow? She never complained‚Äîshe's done everything she could to protect this family.""

Nicolas still hadn't calmed down.

""Athena! Willow even covered for you‚Äîshe told everyone you never poisoned her, just to protect your name. Shouldn't you be grateful?"" he continued.

When Athena said nothing, his voice rose sharply. ""Say something! Are you mute now?""

Athena blinked, struggling to hold back the sting in her eyes.

Once upon a time, Nicolas had been different. Unlike her second and third brothers, he had been the one who truly cared for her.

He once told her he'd split the love he gave Willow and give half to her‚Äîand for a while, he meant it.

When the servants looked down on her, he gave out thirty lashes on her behalf. On her birthday, he carved a jewel pendant for her by hand. When she was sick, he stayed by her side through the night.

But all that kindness vanished the moment Willow acted hurt.

Love that could be so easily withdrawn‚Äîthat kind of love, she no longer wanted.

The air between them turned stiff with silence.

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""What's done is done. Let's go inside‚Äîyour father and grandmother are still waiting.""

Nicolas scoffed and gave a dismissive wave of his sleeve as he turned toward the estate.

After a few steps, he looked back, his voice suddenly soft. ""Willow, come here.""

""Yes, Nicolas."" She smiled sweetly, casting a glance at Athena. She said nothing‚Äîbut somehow, it said everything.

Athena was used to it by now. She had always been the outsider in this family.

She had already made up her mind: she would let go. Let Willow have all of it‚ÄîMichael, her parents, her brothers.

But even with that resolve, watching this unfold still made her throat tighten and her eyes sting.

# 3.Chapter 3 Oversized Clothes

Eloise led Athena through the gates of the estate, turning to the servants as they entered. ""Take Lady Athena to wash up first. After that, she'll go pay her respects to Lady Margaret.""

Then she looked at Athena with a gentle smile. ""Your grandmother's getting on in years. Her health hasn't been great‚Äîshe's been relying on herbal tonics these past few years. When you see her, be sweet and respectful, and don't bring up anything about the last three years. It'll only upset her.""

Athena nodded quietly.

Margaret had always been the most fair-minded person in the family‚Äîbut she was too old now to involve herself in household affairs.

Seeing Athena accept her words without protest, Eloise finally relaxed a little.

She continued, testing the waters, ""You're eighteen now‚Äîof marriageable age. What happened in the camp... let's not mention it again. If word gets out that you spent the last three years living among soldiers, day and night, people will start talking.

""That kind of gossip could ruin your chances of a good match. I've already come up with an explanation. We'll say you were away recuperating, and now you've just returned.""

Athena's face remained calm. She gave a soft ""Yes,"" then followed the maid assigned to her.

But after a few turns, she realized something was wrong. This wasn't the way to her old courtyard.

She asked, and the maid smiled brightly as she explained, ""Lady Willow has been in poor health for years. The doctor said the trees in your courtyard were too damp and affected her health. So they were all cut down.

""To help her recover, they leveled your courtyard and merged it with hers. They even diverted hot spring water to the new space for her treatment. But don't worry, Lady Eloise had this new courtyard cleaned and prepared for you before your return.""

The maid said it as if it were completely normal, perfectly reasonable.

As if everyone had conveniently forgotten that Athena was the true daughter of the house‚Äîwhile Willow was merely adopted.

The maid led Athena to a small, modest courtyard and pushed the door open. ""You'll be staying here from now on, Lady Athena.""

The space was much smaller than her original quarters, and with no greenery in sight, it looked bare and lifeless.

Two unfamiliar maids stepped forward and bowed. ""Lady Athena.""

Athena didn't recognize either of them. After three years away, most of the household staff had changed.

One had a round face, the other an oval one. Both were attractive and sharp-eyed‚Äîclearly selected for looks and cleverness.

""I'm Siena Hotham.""

""I'm Aliza Crofton.""

Together, they echoed, ""Hi, Lady Athena.""

Athena gave a small nod and motioned for them to rise.

Then she asked, ""Where are Thalia and Macy?""

Those had been her personal maids before she was sent away. But once she entered the military camp, all news of them vanished.

The maid smiled and replied, ""Not long after you left, they both got married. I imagine they're living quiet, peaceful lives now‚Äîlooking after their husbands and raising children.""

Athena nodded. A peaceful life sounded good. Far better than serving others for the rest of your days.

The thought brought a faint sense of ease. She stepped inside.

The table was already set. The meal was generous‚Äîfour dishes and a soup‚Äîbut the plates were no bigger than a clenched fist.

She began to eat. One plate of pasta disappeared in just a few bites.

Her brows knit slightly. ""Is there more?""

Siena looked momentarily stunned, then quickly nodded. ""Yes, of course, I'll get it right away.""

Watching her eat so fast, Aliza spoke up gently, ""Lady Athena, please slow down. You'll upset your stomach if you rush like that.""

Athena's fork paused in mid-air. She had nearly forgotten‚Äîthis wasn't the military camp anymore.

This was the duke's estate. No one here was going to snatch her food. No one would dump kitchen slop onto her plate.

The pasta was fragrant. The dishes were fresh. And the meat‚Äîit was real bacon. Not rat. Not snake.

Siena returned with two more plates of pasta.

Athena ate quickly and without grace. There was nothing delicate or refined in her manners‚Äîshe looked more like a starving beggar than a noble daughter.

Siena opened her mouth several times to speak but held her tongue each time.

After the meal, the servants had already prepared hot water for her bath. Siena and Aliza followed her in. ""Lady Athena, allow us to help you bathe,"" Siena offered politely.

""That won't be necessary. You can leave."" Athena said.

Siena hesitated, clearly unsure.

Aliza added with concern, ""If Lady Eloise finds out, she'll punish us for not serving you properly‚Ä¶""

Athena didn't speak. She simply looked at them‚Äîcalm, expressionless.

There was no anger in her eyes, no emotion at all. But the chill behind that blank gaze made both girls shiver.

Without another word, they backed out of the room and quietly closed the door behind them.

Only then did Athena step behind the screen and begin undressing.

Her body was gaunt, skin stretched tightly over bone. Her once-fair skin was now covered in bruises‚Äîsome new, others long faded.

If she hadn't known medicine, she would have died in that place.

After washing, she reached for the fresh clothes laid out on the rack. The fabric was fine‚Äîsoft, warm, and tailored to fit.

But on her starved frame, the robe hung loose and shapeless, making her look more like a walking skeleton than a noble daughter.

""Lady Athena, Lady Eloise and the Lady Margaret are waiting,"" Aliza reminded her from outside.

Athena nodded and made her way toward Starling House.

In just three years, the duke's estate had changed so much.

She paused at the edge of the pond, lost in thought. ""What happened to the lotuses?"" she asked.

""Lady Willow said there were too many mosquitoes in summer,"" Aliza replied. ""So Lord Nicolas had them all removed.""

Athena thought, 'Of course. Willow‚Äîagain.' Athena felt a familiar ache in her chest.

When she had first arrived at the estate, she tried so hard to win everyone over.

She had planted those lotuses herself, hoping to make wine from the blossoms and gift it to Nicolas.

He had laughed at her back then. ""You're my sister. There's no need for all that. But if it makes you happy, I'll help you plant them.""

The proud, aloof heir of the house had actually gotten his hands dirty‚Äîfor her.

At the time, Athena had thought, 'So this is what it feels like to be cherished.'

But now‚Ä¶ it was clear. Whatever kindness they'd shown her didn't come close to how they treated Willow. Not even a tenth of it.

She arrived at Margaret's quarters. The room was already full.

Eloise looked toward the door‚Äîand frowned. She wondered, 'Why does the robe look so oversized on Athena?'

# 4.Chapter 4 The One To Blame

Before Athena could say a word, Nicolas stepped forward, blocking Margaret's view.

""Athena! Are you doing this on purpose?"" he snapped. ""Three years weren't enough to teach you some manners? Still playing your little games? You've really let me down!""

""I told you to present yourself properly. What are you wearing?"" His expression was full of disapproval, his tone unconsciously laced with the stern authority of a Justice Ministry official.

He looked at her like she was standing trial. ""If you've got complaints, direct them at me. Why come here and put on a show in front of Grandmother? Are you trying to make her feel sorry for you? Do you want to upset her so badly she falls ill?""

Athena almost laughed out loud.

She raised an eyebrow, her smile cool and detached. ""The clothes? Lady Eloise picked them out. What did you expect me to wear‚Äîwhat I came back in from the military camp?""

That shut him up. For a moment, Nicolas was at a loss. She had called Eloise ""Lady Eloise""‚Äînot ""Mother.""

Only then did it hit him: ever since Athena returned, she hadn't regarded him as brother once either.

A flicker of unease crept into his chest. The harsh words caught in his throat and never made it out.

His gaze narrowed, a thought nagging at the back of his mind. 'It's only been three years‚Ä¶ how did she waste away like this?'

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""That was my oversight. Don't be too hard on Athena.""

Nicolas stepped aside, allowing Athena to enter.

Margaret's eyes lit up the moment she saw her.

""Come here, come,"" she called, voice trembling slightly. ""Let me take a good look at you.""

That warmth, that longing in her eyes‚ÄîAthena felt her nose sting. She stepped forward and let Margaret take her hands and look her over from head to toe.

""How did you get so thin?"" Margaret pulled her into a hug, holding her tightly, voice choked with emotion. ""My sweet girl‚Ä¶ you've suffered. It's all my fault. I'm too old, too useless‚Ä¶ I couldn't protect you‚Ä¶""

Athena knew how things had gone. Back then, Margaret had stood by her, even if it meant alienating the rest of the family. Her health had already been fragile.

The fact she'd made it through these years at all was a miracle. If not for the empire's strict laws, no one knew what would've happened‚Ä¶

She wrapped her arms around Margaret, and whispered through a tight throat, ""Grandmother.""

Just one word‚Äîand Margaret broke down completely, tears streaming down her face.

Off to the side, Eloise watched the reunion, a pang of bitterness tightening in her chest.

Athena had been home for some time now‚Ä¶ and still hadn't called her ""Mother.""

She dabbed at her eyes with a silk handkerchief, playing the part of the grieving parent.

Willow stepped up, gently hugging her. ""Don't be sad, Mother. Athena's home now."" Her voice was soft, comforting, obedient.

Eloise looked down at her beloved Willow and felt deeply comforted.

She nodded, eyes still wet, but a faint smile tugging at her lips. She thought, 'At least Willow understands.'

But just as she started to feel at ease, that smile froze.

Margaret's voice, quivering and confused, rang out, ""What's going on?""

Athena's once delicate fingers were now covered in scars‚Äîblackened bruises and jagged welts. When she lifted her sleeve, old knife wounds and fresh burns marred the skin along her arms.

Margaret's gaze faltered. She couldn't bear to look any longer. ""She was sent to do labor‚Ä¶ how did she end up like this?""

Eloise looked genuinely shocked. ""These injuries‚Äîhow did they happen?""

Surrounded by concerned faces, Athena buried the emptiness in her eyes and replied softly, ""They came from the overseers at the camp, of course‚Ä¶""

Gasps rippled through the room. Athena's lips curled into a faint, mocking smile. ""I was there to work, not to be treated like a young lady. Getting beaten was just part of the routine.""

She didn't say more. Even recalling it made her stomach turn.

But her few words had already shaken everyone to the core. They thought, 'Beaten‚Äîfor three full years. How has she even survived?'

Margaret's hands trembled as she clutched Athena's. ""How could they? How dare they? You're the duke's daughter! That camp was under your fianc√©'s command‚Äîhow could anyone there lay a finger on you?""

Athena's smile grew, cold and biting. ""Because someone gave the order.""

Nicolas's face turned red with fury. ""You really are useless. You let them beat you like that and didn't even fight back?""

Athena's voice stayed flat, almost detached. ""Do you think a place like that gave me the right to speak, let alone resist? Being quiet and obedient meant fewer beatings. That's the reality.""

She looked directly at him, that faint smile still on her lips. ""Isn't that what you wanted, Lord Nicolas? For me to behave? To finally be 'taught a lesson'? Well, I've learned it. I'm quiet now. Isn't that what makes you happy?""

Nicolas stared at her in silence.

She was smiling, yes‚Äîbut it never reached her eyes. She hadn't said a single word of accusation, yet the guilt hit him like a knife to the chest.

His expression began to soften, just as he opened his mouth to speak‚Äîwhen Willow's voice suddenly broke in.

""This is all my fault. I'm the one who should be blamed. If my body weren't so weak‚Äîif I hadn't reacted badly to the medicine‚ÄîAthena never would've been punished.

""I was never meant to belong to this family anyway. Maybe‚Ä¶ maybe I should go live in the countryside with my birth parents‚Ä¶""

She dissolved into sobs, her voice quivering with each breath. Tears streamed freely down her face, as if she were the one who had suffered.

Immediately, Eloise rushed to her side, flustered, gently stroking her back. ""There, don't cry, darling. You'll make yourself sick.""

Nicolas jumped in too, alarmed. ""You know how fragile your health is‚Äîwhat are you doing, crying like this? If I'd known, I never would've let you come. Now look what's happened.""

Then he turned, casting a sharp look at Athena. As if to say, ""Why do you have to show those wounds? Now Grandmother is heartbroken, Willow is in tears, and Mother is riddled with guilt.""

Before long, everyone in the room was fussing over Willow‚Äîoffering her coffee, passing her medicine, soothing her with kind words.

And Athena? She stood there alone, forgotten, as if she were nothing more than a bystander.

But of course‚Ä¶ she wasn't a bystander. She was the cause. The reason for their guilt, their worry, their pain. The one to blame.

# 5.Chapter 5 Should Leave You There

Just then, the Duke of Suffield‚ÄîHenry Monson‚Äîwalked into the room.

His commanding gaze swept over everyone before lingering for a moment on Athena. Then, turning to Margaret, he bowed respectfully. ""Mother.""

Margaret quickly waved him up. ""No need for that, get up.""

After he rose, Nicolas and Willow both greeted him warmly. ""Father.""

Only Athena, calm and detached, said, ""Duke of Suffield.""

That one phrase froze the air in the room.

Henry frowned, as if he hadn't heard her right. ""What did you call me?""

A hint of anger crept into his expression.

Athena lowered her eyes and repeated softly, ""Duke of Suffield.""

Smack! The sound of the slap echoed through the hall as Athena's head snapped to the side.

""You ungrateful thing. Three years in the camp, and you still haven't learned a single ounce of humility?"" he roared.

He continued, ""Calling me 'Duke of Suffield'‚Äîwhat, you trying to cut ties with the family? If you still don't know your place, go back to the military camp and stay there! We don't need a disgrace like you in this household!""

Eloise rushed forward, throwing her arms around Athena protectively. ""Enough! If you have to hit someone, then hit me!""

Margaret rose to her feet, trembling with fury, and lifted her cane to strike Henry.

Tears streamed down her face as she shouted, ""Do you have any idea what she's been through these past three years? And now, right in front of me, you hit her? You might as well be hitting me!""

She had only just started to mend Athena's wounded heart. And now, with a single slap, he'd torn it wide open again. He was her father. Her biological father.

Margaret tried to fight for her‚Äîbut her cane never landed. The moment she raised it, servants rushed in and stopped her. She didn't even touch his robes.

Athena stood silently off to the side, watching the chaos unfold, her expression cold and unreadable.

She thought, 'So this is the family that promises never to hurt me again. How absurd.'

Eloise turned in a panic to check Athena's face‚Äîbut before she could, a sudden cry rang out. It was Willow.

Everyone turned. A thin trail of blood was trickling from her temple.

The room fell dead silent.

Henry's face twisted in alarm as he called out, ""Quick! Call the physician!""

Nicolas's eyes were red, his brows deeply furrowed. He looked like he'd rather have taken the injury himself. He said, ""Why would you rush in like that? What if it scars? She can handle it‚Äîshe's used to it. But you? You're delicate. You shouldn't be hurt like this‚Ä¶""

Willow's voice was soft and trembling, her eyes filled with tears that clung to her lashes. ""I was just scared Father might get hurt‚Ä¶ I didn't even think. I just moved.""

When Willow spoke, Henry's heart ached even more.

Everyone in the room hovered around Willow, fussing over her.

Meanwhile, Athena stood quietly to the side, her cheek visibly swollen‚Äîyet no one paid her any attention.

She said nothing. A flicker of cold amusement passed through her eyes.

When Henry slapped her, Eloise didn't even flinch.

But the moment Willow was accidentally hurt, that same ""mother"" had panicked like her life depended on it.

Anyone watching would've thought Willow was her real daughter.

Henry, still full of concern, didn't forget to glare at Athena.

He said, ""If it weren't for you, none of this would've happened. Honestly, we never should've brought you back thirteen years ago. Should've left you where you were.""

Nicolas also gave her a disapproving look‚Äîbut when he saw the bruise on her face, he hesitated, and swallowed his words.

""Enough. That's enough. All of you, out,"" Margaret said with a headache brewing behind her temples.

""Yes,"" the others responded, withdrawing.

Margaret gently took Athena's hand and began applying medicine to her swollen cheek herself.

She said, ""Athena, don't hold it against your father. He's got a temper. But from now on, I won't let anyone hurt you again.""

Looking into Margaret's loving, weathered eyes, Athena couldn't bring herself to say the sharp words that had been sitting on the tip of her tongue.

""Of course not,"" she replied, forcing a quiet smile.

Margaret sighed. She wanted to say more, but fatigue overtook her. She waved Athena off to rest. ""We'll talk later.""

After helping Margaret lie down, Athena finally returned to her courtyard.

She had barely sat down when a familiar voice called from outside. ""Athena, are you asleep?""

Irritation flickered across Athena's face. She signaled for Siena to open the door.

Eloise stepped inside. Her gaze landed immediately on Athena's swollen cheek. She walked over, her voice gentle. ""Does it still hurt?""

Athena stared at her, silent, as if asking a question without words.

Eloise quickly realized how foolish her concern must have sounded. She hurried to continue, ""Athena, I brought you some wound medicine from Harmony Apothecary. This one's made by a famous physician‚Äîit's the best.

""The healer's been missing for three years now. His medicine is nearly impossible to find. Use it sparingly‚Äîit'll fade your bruises in less than a month.""

She reached out, tucking a loose strand of Athena's hair behind her ear. ""Athena, I've let you down. I didn't protect you when you needed it. If you're angry, blame me. Just‚Ä¶ don't take it out on anyone else.

""From now on, I'll treat you right. I promise.""

She pressed the medicine jar into Athena's hand. Athena opened it‚Äîand saw right away that it was half empty.

She knew this medicine. She was the one who produced it. She knew exactly how much was supposed to be in a full jar.

Of course. It had been used already. Passed down to her only after someone else didn't need it anymore.

Eloise noticed her silence and felt a sting of disappointment.

Athena hadn't always been like this. She used to smile at everything she was given. Used to sweetly call her ""Mother,"" like it meant something.

Now, she was distant. Cold. A stranger.

'Willow would never act like this,' she thought. 'That child is so thoughtful, so gentle.'

""Well, I'll let you rest. I'll stop by again tomorrow,"" Eloise said.

Athena stood. ""Take care, Lady Eloise.""

She made no move to walk her out. Eloise hid her disappointment, turned, and left with slow, unsteady steps.

Athena watched her go, a faint crease forming between her brows.

She thought, 'If not for Margaret's illness‚Ä¶ I wouldn't stay in this house another day.'

Reina gave Alpha Dominic everything, her heart, her loyalty, and five years of her life. But the moment she finally carried his child, she discovered the cruel truth. He never loved or wanted her. He had been secretly poisoning her, ensuring she would never bear his heir. And now, his mistress, Selena, is carrying his child instead.

Betrayed and broken, Reina refuses to be the weak Luna they all expect her to be. She won‚Äôt beg or cry. She will rise.

The only problem is that Dominic isn‚Äôt willing to let her go.

When he realizes the fire he thought he had extinguished is now burning hotter than ever, he does the one thing she never expected.

He begs.

But is it too late? Or will Reina destroy him before he gets the chance to ruin her again?

\--

I held the pregnancy test in my hand, staring at the two pink lines as I walked out of the pack healer's cottage. After five years of marriage to Alpha Dominic, I was finally pregnant. My heart was filled with happiness as I placed the test into my purse.

I'd already stopped by the gift shop in town, picking up the watch he'd been eyeing for months. The saleswoman had wrapped it beautifully with a silver bow which was his favorite color.

As I pulled out my phone to text Dominic that I was coming to surprise him, it buzzed with a notification. An unknown number had sent me several videos. Curious, I pulled over and opened the first one.

There was Dominic, his arms wrapped around a beautiful golden-haired woman, Selena. His ex-girlfriend, the daughter of the neighboring Alpha. The woman he'd sworn meant nothing to him anymore.

He was smiling at her, looking at her the way he used to look at me.

With trembling fingers, I played the next video. They were kissing and his hands were tangled in her hair. The timestamp showed it was from yesterday.

I started the car in a daze and drove home. When I pulled into our driveway, I noticed an unfamiliar car parked near the side entrance, the one that led directly to our bedroom.

I slipped into the house quietly, following the sound of voices until I reached the hallway outside our bedroom. The door was slightly opened, and I could hear them clearly.

""So you mean Reina hasn't suspected anything?"" Selena's voice came through the door.

""Not yet.‚Äù Dominic replied with a cruel chuckle. ‚ÄúShe's too busy trying to get pregnant while I've been taking those fertility-suppressing herbs for the past five years.""

""That's genius of you,"" Selena purred, ""but how then did I get pregnant with your child if you've been taking herbs?""

My heart stopped immediately. Pregnant? Selena is pregnant?

""I stopped taking them when you came back,"" Dominic said proudly. ""I wanted you to have my pup, not her. I could never bear having a child with her.""

""Just as it should be,"" Selena said smugly. ""We'll finally be together as true mates should.""

‚ÄúI'm going to dissolve our bond,"" Dominic declared. ""Reina will understand it's for the best. The pack needs stronger heirs than she could ever provide.""

""But what about her mother?"" Selena asked. ""Do you think she'll ever know the truth about her? That her mother was framed for betraying the pack?""

My head snapped up. My mother had been banished from the territory five years ago, accused of leaking territory maps to the rogues. I had never believed she was guilty.

""That you were the one who actually leaked our territory maps to the rogues?"" Dominic laughed coldly. ""No one would believe it. Her mother was banished years ago. Everyone's forgotten about her.""

""It worked perfectly,"" Selena said. ""With her mother gone, Reina had no family left. She was so desperate for love that she fell right into your arms.""

The pregnancy test slipped from my fingers and clattered to the floor. A small burst escaped my lips before I could stop it.

The conversation inside immediately stopped. I scrambled to pick up the test and ran down the hallway to my private study, closing the door quietly behind me. My whole body trembled as I sank to the floor, tears falling down my face.

Everything had been a lie. Every touch, every kiss, every promise. The man I had given everything to had been plotting against me all along. He had taken my mother from me and now he planned to take my future as well.

I heard his footsteps in the hallway, coming closer. Quickly, I wiped my tears and straightened my clothes. I slipped the pregnancy test into my pocket just as he opened the door.

""Luna?"" he called out. ""Are you alright? I thought I heard something.""

I forced a smile. ""I'm fine,"" I said softly. ""Just a bit tired.""

Relief flooded his good-looking face. He crossed the room and pulled me into his arms, kissing my forehead tenderly. ""You work too hard,"" he murmured against my skin. ""You should rest.""

I let him hold me, let him believe I was still his naive and trusting Luna.

""I love you,"" he whispered, and I wondered how many times he had practiced those words to make them sound so sincere.

""I love you too,"" I lied, my mind already racing with plans.

He kissed me once more before leaving, promising to check on me later. As soon as the door closed, I let the tears fall freely again. But these weren't tears of despair. These were tears of rage and of determination.

My hand moved protectively over my stomach. This child deserved better and mother deserved justice.

Alpha Dominic had taken everything from me but now I would take everything from him.

Starting from his precious Selena.



CHAPTER 2

I was walking toward the garden when I heard Dominic's voice from his study.

""I miss you too,""His tone was warm and intimate in a way it never was with me. ""I can't wait to see you tonight.""

My claws extended out but I forced them back. I took a deep breath, and pushed the door open with a bright smile pasted on my face.

Dominic turned quickly, his phone disappearing into his pocket. ""Luna. I didn't hear you coming.""

""Pack meeting reports,"" I said, holding up a folder I'd grabbed from my office. ""Who was that?""

""Alpha Marcus from the Southern Ridge,"" he lied smoothly. ""Pack alliance discussions.""

I nodded as if I believed him. ""How's it going?""

""Good,"" he said, coming closer to wrap his arms around me. ""I need to head to their territory today for formal negotiations. I'll be back tomorrow night.""

I leaned into his embrace and murmured. ""Be safe.""

""Always am."" He kissed the top of my head. ""I've got something worth coming back to.""

After Dominic left, I waited exactly thirty minutes before making my move. I had to find evidence of the herbs he'd been taking, something concrete to prove his betrayal.

I entered our bedroom and went straight to his nightstand. Nothing in the drawers but books and a watch. His closet revealed nothing suspicious either. I moved to the bathroom, searching through his toiletries and medicine cabinet. Still nothing.

I returned to the bedroom and knelt beside the bed. There, underneath, was a small wooden box I'd never noticed before.

Inside were dozens of empty vials, each labeled with the same script: \*Fertility Suppressant ‚Äì Take Daily\*. There was a single vial still half-full of liquid.

""Perfect,"" I whispered, slipping the half-empty vial into my pocket.

But I needed more than just this. The vial would prove his deception about our inability to conceive, but I needed evidence about my mother or Selena's betrayal of the pack.

As night fell, I got into my car and drove toward the outskirts of our territory, to a place I hadn't visited in years‚Äîthe home of Mira, my mother's closest friend and the pack's former Beta female before my mother's banishment.

Before I could even knock, the door swung open.

""Reina,"" Mira exclaimed, her eyes widening as she took in my presence. ""What happened?""

""I know the truth,"" I said simply. ""About my mother. About what Dominic did. About everything.""

She pulled me inside quickly, checking the darkness outside before locking the door behind us. ""How much do you know?"" she asked.

""Enough to destroy them,"" I replied. ""But I need your help.""

""You have it,"" she said. ""I've been waiting for this day.""

We spent hours huddled at her kitchen table. Mira still had connections‚Äîwolves loyal to my mother who had never believed the lies, warriors who had been forced out of the pack when they questioned my mother's banishment. She had names, locations and promises of support.

There's something else you should know,"" Mira said finally. ""Your mother... she's alive.""

""What?"" I whispered. ""But Dominic said‚Äî""

""Dominic lied,"" Mira cut in sharply. ""After her banishment, she went to the Northern Crescent pack. They gave her sanctuary. She's been waiting and gathering support. Waiting for you to learn the truth.""

Tears spilled down my cheeks‚Äîthe first I'd allowed myself since discovering Dominic's betrayal. ""Take me to her.""

""Not yet,"" Mira cautioned, squeezing my hands. ""It's too dangerous. Dominic has spies everywhere. But soon.""

She released my hands and walked to a small drawer, extracting a sleek black phone. ""Untraceable,"" she explained, handing it to me. ""When you're ready, call the number saved in it. Your mother will answer.""

I clutched it like a lifeline, this connection to the mother I'd thought lost forever.

Dawn was breaking when I left Mira's cabin with resources gathered and a network of allies at my disposal. But I made one more stop before returning home.

The pack healer's cottage stood silent in the early morning light. I didn't bother knocking. I pushed open the door to find Elena already awake, mixing herbs at her table.

‚ÄúLuna Reina!"" she exclaimed, nearly dropping her mortar and pestle.

""I know what you did,"" I said coldly. ""The fertility suppressant herbs for Dominic and the treatments for him.""

""I don't know what you're talking about,"" she stammered, but her hands shook.

I pulled the vial from my pocket. ""This. You've been making this for years.""

The healer's face paled. She set down her mortar and pestle with shaking hands. ""I was merely following the Alpha's orders.""

""And what about your oath to protect all pack members?"" I stepped closer. ""Did that mean nothing when you helped him keep me childless? When you helped Selena conceive his child?""

""What do you want from me?""

""Nothing,"" I said, raising my phone. ""I just wanted you to admit it.""

Her eyes widened as she realized I'd been recording our entire conversation.

""What will you do?"" she whispered.

""That depends,"" I said. ""Are you loyal to the Alpha... or to the mother of the true heir to Silver Moon pack?""

She blinked rapidly. ""Wait‚Äîyou're pregnant?""

""Apparently the Moon Goddess intervened,"" I replied coolly. ""Or should I say, he got careless. So what's it going to be?""

She hesitated only briefly before kneeling. ""I serve the true bloodline. Your child is the rightful heir.""

""Then help me with a potion to mask my pregnancy from everyone‚Äîincluding Dominic until I'm ready for the truth to be known.""

She moved to her shelves immediately, gathering ingredients. ""It will be done, Luna.""

I returned to the pack house just as the sun fully rose, hearing Dominic car in the driveway. He was back early. Perfect.

I smoothed my dress, applied fresh lipstick and positioned myself in the kitchen. The front door opened. ""Luna?"" he called out. ""I'm home early. Missed you too much.""

I smiled at my reflection in the kitchen window, watching the dangerous woman I was becoming.

""In here,"" I called back sweetly. ""I've been waiting for you.""

CHAPTER 3

Dominic appeared in the doorway, his face lighting up at the sight of me. In three long steps, he crossed the kitchen and wrapped his arms around me.

""I missed you so much,"" he whispered against my hair.

I returned his embrace, ignoring the way my wolf recoiled inside me. As he held me close, I caught the unmistakable scent of rosewood and jasmine perfume clinging to his skin. Selena's scent.

I pulled back while keeping my smile intact. ""How was your trip? I thought you said you'd be back tomorrow night.""

""The negotiations went faster than expected,"" he replied, brushing a strand of hair from my face. ""Alpha Marcus was very... accommodating.""

I nodded, pretending to believe the lie. ""That's wonderful. Are you hungry? I made your favorite.""

His eyes brightened. ""Starving.""

I served him a plate of the venison stew I'd prepared earlier, watching as he devoured it with enthusiasm. I sat across from him, nursing a cup of tea and waiting.

""Speaking of news,"" Dominic said between bites, ""we're going to have a guest staying with us for a while.""

I raised an eyebrow. ""Oh? Who?""

""Selena,"" he said. ""Her father's territory is dealing with some rogue attacks near their borders. I offered our protection until things settle down.""

I gripped my teacup tighter, the glass nearly cracking under my fingers. ""You mean your ex will be staying here? In our home?""

""Former ex,"" he corrected. ""Now she's just an ally. Her father is an important pack leader, Reina. We need their allegiance.""

I took a sip of tea to hide my reaction. How much more would they infiltrate my life? How much longer would they mock me under my own roof?

I forced myself to take a deep breath. ""When will she arrive?""

""In two days,"" he replied, pushing his empty plate away. ""I need to head out for another pack meeting. Can you prepare the blue guest room for her?""

I nodded, watching as he stood, dropped a quick kiss on my forehead and left without another backward glance.

After Dominic left, I went to the guest bedroom at the far end of the house. If Selena was going to stay with us, I wanted her as far from our bedroom as possible. I changed the linens and placed fresh towels in the adjoining bathroom.

As I smoothed down the comforter, I pulled out the untraceable phone Mira had given me. My thumb hovered over the single number saved in its contacts. Not yet, I told myself. I needed more evidence and more allies. When I struck, it would be decisive.

I slipped the phone back into my pocket and continued preparing for our unwelcome guest.

Two days later, I heard a car pull into the driveway. I stood at the top of the grand staircase, watching as the front door opened.

Selena entered and stood in the doorway, surveying our home like she already owned it. She was still the same as I remembered‚Äîbeautiful, with her long golden hair cascading over her shoulders.

""Reina,"" she said. ""It's been so long.""

""Selena,"" I replied coolly. ""Welcome to our home.""

She glanced around with her calculative gazs. ""Where's the Alpha? He said he would receive me personally.""

The way she said ""personally"" made my blood boil, but I maintained my composure.

""He had an urgent matter to attend to,"" I lied. ""He should be back soon. Would you like something to drink while you wait?""

""Water would be fine,"" she said dismissively, moving past me to enter the living room. She sat on the couch, my usual spot and crossed her legs, looking completely at home.

I brought her water, setting it on the coffee table without a word. Finally, the sound of Dominic's car broke the tension. The front door opened, and he appeared, his eyes immediately seeking out Selena.

I stood, intending to greet my husband as any dutiful Luna would, but he walked right past me. He crossed the room and pulled Selena into a tight embrace that lasted far too long.

""You made it safely,"" he said with genuine concern. ""I was worried.""

Selena smiled up at him. ""The journey was fine. Though my hands are hurting from carrying my bags. They're still outside.""

Only then did Dominic seem to notice me standing there, watching their reunion with anger. He had the decency to look slightly embarrassed.

""Reina,"" he said. ""Could you help Selena bring her bags in? Put them in the blue guest room.""

I stared at him, unable to believe what I was hearing. My husband, the Alpha, was asking me,his Luna to act as a servant for his mistress.

CHAPTER 4

I forced a smile masking the rage burning through me.

""Of course,"" I said with a practiced smile. ""I'd be happy to help our guest.""

Selena smirked as I walked past her to the front door. Outside, three large suitcases sat by her car, as if she was planning to stay for months rather than weeks. I grabbed the smallest one first, not wanting to strain myself in my condition.

One by one, I carried the heavy suitcases up the stairs and down the hall to the blue guest room. My arms ached by the time I finished, but I refused to show weakness.

""Is there anything else you need?"" I asked pleasantly as Selena entered the room.

""I think I can manage from here,"" she replied, making a dismissive gesture with her hand. ""You can go now.""

I nodded and closed the door behind me, but I didn't leave.There was something very suspicious in her bag,and I trust my Instinct.

Instead, I listened, hearing the click of the lock. Perfect. I waited in the hallway, counting seconds until I heard the shower turn on in the bathroom.

Silently, I unlocked the door using my master key and slipped back inside. I moved quickly to the largest suitcase and unzipped it carefully.

The zipper slid open silently, revealing neatly folded clothes on top.I pushed them aside and froze. There, carefully wrapped in cloth, was a large bundle of dried purple flowers‚Äîconsecrated wolfsbane, the most potent form that could weaken even an Alpha. Beside it lay a silver dagger, its handle inscribed with ancient runes known to cause excruciating pain to our kind.

My hands trembled as I reached deeper into the suitcase. Underneath a layer of silk scarves, I found it,a folded map of our territory. I spread it open carefully. Red circles marked strategic points‚Äîour guard posts, patrol routes, and most alarming of all, the underground tunnels known only to pack leadership.

""What are you planning?"" I whispered, quickly pulling out my phone to snap pictures of everything. I sent them to Mira with a simple text: Found these in Selena's luggage. She's planning something.It's worse than we thought.

Her response came seconds later: Not surprising. Keep watching. Stay safe.

From my pocket, I retrieved the tiny listening devices and cameras Mira had given me. I worked swiftly, placing one under the nightstand, another in the closet, and a third behind the mirror. Just as I finished, I heard the shower turn off.

I froze, my heart pounding in my chest. There was no time to reach the door. I dove under the bed, tucking myself into the shadows just as the bathroom door opened. Selena's bare feet padded across the hardwood floor. She moved to the suitcase I'd just searched, and I held my breath, certain I'd been discovered.

But she merely grabbed some clothes and returned to the bathroom. I didn't waste the opportunity. I slipped out from under the bed and out the door, closing it silently behind me.

My next stop was Dominic's study. I planted devices in the bookshelf, under his desk, and inside the small clock on the [wall.As](http://wall.As) I finished, I heard footsteps approaching. I quickly positioned myself at the desk, pretending to organize papers as Dominic entered.

""What are you doing in here?"" he asked, his voice sharp with suspicion.

I looked up innocently. ""Just organizing your schedule for the week. I wanted to make sure you had time for the border patrol reports tomorrow.""

He seemed to accept this, his posture relaxing. ""Always so thoughtful,"" he murmured, but there was no warmth in his voice. ""Dinner should be ready by seven,right?""

""Of course, Alpha,"" I replied.

Dinner was a masterclass in pretense. I sat at my usual place at the end of the table, while Dominic and Selena engaged in their conversation about pack politics, old friends, and shared memories. They barely acknowledged my presence except when they needed something passed to them.

""The venison is excellent, Reina,"" Selena commented, her tone suggesting surprise that I could accomplish something so basic.

""Thank you,"" I said, smiling. ""It's Dominic's favorite.""

""Oh, I know,"" she replied with a knowing look. ""He always did prefer his meat rare and fresh.""

The double meaning wasn't lost on me. I maintained my smile even as my wolf snarled within me.

""More wine, Selena?"" I offered.

""Please,"" she replied, holding out her glass. As I poured, her free hand slipped beneath the table to rest on Dominic's thigh and he didn't move away.

After dinner, I excused myself, claiming a headache. Neither seemed particularly disappointed by my departure.

In our bedroom, I changed into my nightgown and sat at my vanity, brushing my hair with precise strokes. The door opened, and Dominic entered.

""Is your headache better?"" he asked, not quite meeting my eyes.

""Much,"" I lied. ""How is our guest settling in?""

""She's comfortable,"" he said, removing his watch. ""I'll be working late in my study tonight. Don't wait up.""

I nodded, watching him grab clothes from the dresser before disappearing into the bathroom. When he came closer, he kissed my forehead and left.

I waited thirty minutes before retrieving my tablet from its hiding place in my drawer. I connected my tablet to the hidden cameras, and hit play.

I was about to give up for the night when Selena's phone rang. She answered it immediately with her voice barely whispers.

""Yes, everything is in place,"" she said. ""The Luna suspects nothing.""

I leaned closer to my screen, straining to hear.

""He actually bought the lie about me being pregnant ,"" she continued with a laugh. ""He believes it. Men are so easily fooled when they want something to be true.""

My hand instinctively moved to my stomach, where my own secret grew stronger each day.

""Once I'm officially announced as his new mate, we'll implement the next phase,"" Selena continued. ""The pack will be ours by the full moon. My father's warriors are ready.""

There was a pause as she listened to whoever was on the other line.

""And the Luna?"" Selena's voice turned cold. ""If she becomes a problem, I'll handle her personally. No one will question if she has an... unfortunate accident.

I turned off the tablet, my heart hammering in my chest. They weren't just planning to humiliate me or push me aside, they were planning to kill me if necessary. And they weren't just after my position,they wanted the entire pack.

As I set the tablet down, a floorboard creaked behind me. I whirled around to find Selen standing in the doorway, her eyes fixed on the screen showing her room.

""So,"" She said, her voice deadly calm as she closed the door behind her. ""You've been spying on me.""



CHAPTER 5

I slipped out of bed at dawn, leaving Dominic sleeping soundly. His arm had been across my body all night, though his dreams had called out Selena's name twice.

The kitchen had always been my sanctuary. I prepared a hearty breakfast‚Äîeggs, bacon, and fresh blueberry pancakes that Dominic loved. My hands worked automatically while my mind plotted.

""Playing housewife so early?"" Selena's mocking voice broke the silence.

I didn't turn around. ""Good morning, Selena."" I said pleasantly, turning back to the gas cooker. ""Sleep well?""

She came closer, wearing nothing but one of Dominic's shirts that barely reached mid-thigh. My claws threatened to emerge, but I forced them back.

""Terribly,"" she sighed dramatically. ""The guest room bed is so uncomfortable. Maybe I should ask Dominic if I could sleep somewhere more... suitable.""

My hand tightened around the spatula. ""I'm sure we can find you a better mattress.""

She moved closer, her rosewood scent invading my space. ""Don't pretend you don't know what's happening, Reina. I've seen the way you look at us.""

I kept my focus on the eggs. ""I'm not sure what you mean.""

""Dominic doesn't love you,"" she said bluntly. ""He never has. You were just convenient after I left.""

The spatula clattered against the pan. ""You need to stop.""

""Why?"" she challenged. ""Because you can't handle the truth? That your marriage is a sham? That your mother was right to betray‚Äî""

The sound of my palm hitting her cheek echoed through the kitchen. Selena's eyes widened in shock, then narrowed with malice.

""You little nuisance,"" she hissed, her hand flying to her reddening cheek just as heavy footsteps approached.

Dominic appeared in the doorway, his expression darkening as he took in the scene. ""What the heck is going on?""

Before I could speak, Selena burst into tears. ""I was just trying to be friendly,"" she sobbed. ""I told her how much I appreciated her hospitality, and she attacked me!""

Dominic's eyes flashed dangerously as he turned to me. ""Is this how you treat our guests? Our allies?""

""She's lying,"" I said, my voice surprisingly steady despite my racing heart. ""She was insulting our marriage.""

Selena hid her face in his chest, her body shaking with false sobs. ""I thought we were friends, Reina. I don't understand why you hate me.""

Dominic's arm tightened around her. ""Apologize to Selena. Now.""

I felt my wolf raging inside me, demanding we challenge them both. But the tiny life inside me needed protection more than my pride needed satisfaction.

""I'm sorry, Selena,"" I managed, the words tasting like ash. ""I misunderstood the situation.""

Dominic nodded curtly. ""Finish breakfast. We have pack business to discuss.""

He guided Selena to a seat at the table, his hand lingering on her lower back. I turned back to the stove, my hands trembling with rage.

Later that afternoon, I slipped away to Mira's cabin, passing through the woods unnoticed by Dominic's patrol guards.

""It's worse than we thought,"" Mira said after reviewing the photos I'd taken. ""These marks on the map,they're planning an attack through the northern border.""

""When?"" I asked.

""A day after the full moon. Fifteen days from now."" She pointed to a date marked on the map. ""They need Dominic weakened before then.""

""The wolfsbane,"" I realized. ""She's poisoning him slowly.""

Mira nodded. ""You need to be careful. The dose that weakens him could kill your child.""

I placed a protective hand over my stomach. ""What should I do?""

""Continue gathering evidence,"" she advised. ""But we need to make contact with Alpha Mark of the Northern Crescent. He's been sheltering your mother and he's also our strongest potential ally.""

She handed me a small vial of clear liquid. ""This will protect your baby from any wolfsbane that might find its way into your food.""

As I left Mira's cabin, my phone buzzed with a text from the pack's Beta: Emergency meeting called. All council members required.

I hurried back to the pack house, slipping in through the kitchen entrance.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

After the emergency meeting, I made my way to the pack archives housed in the basement of the main building. The elderly archivist, Joel, looked up in surprise as I entered.

""Luna Reina,"" he greeted me warmly. ""What brings you here today?""

""Research,"" I replied. ""I need information about pack law regarding Luna succession.""

His eyebrows rose. ""An unusual request. May I ask why?""

""Just refreshing my knowledge,"" I said smoothly. ""Could you also pull the records from five years ago? Particularly regarding my mother's trial?""

Joel hesitated. ""Those are sealed by Alpha's orders.""

I leaned forward. ""Joel, how long have you known my mother?""

""Twenty years,"" he replied softly. ""She was a good woman,right?.""

""Then help me now,"" I whispered. ""Please.""

He studied my face before nodding slowly. ""Wait here.""

Joel disappeared into the stacks then he returned, placing an ancient leather-bound book and a sealed folder before me. ""Be careful, Luna,"" he murmured. ""These are dangerous waters.""

I opened the book to find the answer I needed‚Äîand something else entirely. Inside was a handwritten confession signed by Dominic, detailing exactly how he and Selena had framed my mother for treason.



CHAPTER 6

I woke up struggling for air, my hands clutching my stomach. Something was very wrong.

A sharp pain radiated through my [abdomen.My](http://abdomen.My) nightgown was damp with sweat as I stumbled to the bathroom, careful not to wake Dominic who slept soundly, oblivious to my distress.

Once inside, I locked the door and sank to the floor, my vision blurring as another wave of pain hit me. Was I losing the baby? Panic surged through me as I fumbled for my phone.

""Healer Elena,"" I whispered when she answered, my voice strained. ""Something's happening. The baby‚Äî""

""Where are you?"" she asked sharply.

""Bathroom. Can't let Dominic see me like this.""

""I'll be there in fifteen minutes.I'll use the servants' entrance."" She hung up without another word.

I managed to pull myself up, splashing cold water on my face. In the mirror, my reflection was frightening‚Äîpale skin, dark circles under my eyes. I changed into fresh clothes and slipped out of the bathroom.

Dominic hadn't moved. I crept past our bed and down the back stairs, each step sending fresh waves of pain through my body.

The night air was cold against my skin as I made my way to the servants' entrance. Elena was already waiting with a medical bag in hand.

""Inside,"" she whispered, helping me through the door. ""The examination room. Quickly.""

We moved through the silent house, pausing at every creak and shift of the old floorboards. Finally, we reached the small room where Elena treated minor pack injuries.

""Lie down,"" she instructed, closing the door behind us.

I obeyed, wincing as she pressed her hands against my abdomen. Her brow furrowed in concentration as she worked, mixing herbs and checking my vitals.

""What's happening?"" I asked, my voice breaking. ""Am I losing the baby?""

Elena's expression was grim. ""Not naturally, no.""

""What do you mean?""

""There's wolfsbane in your system,"" she said quietly. ""Not enough to harm you significantly, but enough to threaten the ..."" ,gesturing to my baby.

My blood ran cold. ""Wolfsbane? How?""

""It was in your food or drink. Diluted and carefully administered."" She mixed something in a small cup. ""Drink this. It will counteract the effects.""

As I took the bitter liquid, realization dawned. ""Selena served us tea this afternoon. Said it was a special blend from her territory...""

Elena asked,. ""Does she know you're \~?.""

""No? I've been taking the concealment potion‚Äî""

Elena checked my pulse again. ""The baby should be safe now, but you need to be more careful. Don't consume anything she offers you.""

I closed my eyes, anger replacing fear. ""She wants to kill my baby.""

""Or she wants to expose your pregnancy before you're ready,"" Elena suggested. ""Either way, you're in danger now.""",1,1750918427.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

At my wedding ceremony with Maxwell Ferguson, his secretary sent him a message: Maxwell, my turtle is on a hunger strike, and I‚Äôm a little worried about its health.

Without a second thought, Maxwell walked out, leaving me alone at the altar. Humiliation washed over me as whispers and stares from the guests closed in like a noose.

I confronted him later, my voice shaking with disbelief.

He shrugged. ‚ÄúIt was just a wedding.‚Äù

‚ÄúChelsea‚Äôs turtle might die if it doesn‚Äôt eat,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a life!‚Äù

Then, as if I were the unreasonable one, he snapped, ‚ÄúWhy are you being so cruel?‚Äù

That night, I opened my phone and saw his latest social media post: a picture of two hands intertwined, captioned‚Äî

A forced marriage is nothing compared to time spent with my little turtle.

Without hesitation, I commented: Congratulations. Wishing you and that shameless woman a long and happy life together.

Then I dialed the number I‚Äôd never forgotten and asked,

‚ÄúYou once promised to marry me. Does that offer still stand?‚Äù

‚Äî‚Äî

The groom ditching the wedding was something the Fergusons had never seen before.

""Just some nobody orphan girl with a pretty face. No wonder Maxwell ditched the wedding.""

""Who'd want a girl with that kind of background, let alone someone from the Fergusons?""

""I wonder when Maxwell will get tired of her and let me have a go. That face, that body, tsk tsk tsk.""

The looks people gave me were a mix of pity, mockery and barely concealed lust.

I clutched the bouquet tightly in my hands. The Fergusons looked down on my background so much that even my wedding dress was a defective one thrown out by the bridal shop.

Annabelle said I should know my place, that someone as lowly as I should be grateful to marry into the Fergusons. She said having even one decent dress was more than I deserved.

""Suzanne, have you contacted Maxwell?"" The elegant and wealthy woman below the stage shot me a disgusted look.

My heart trembled and the scars on my back began to ache again. I gripped the hem of my dress, not knowing what to do and whispered.

""Mom, he hasn't replied.""

Annabelle's brows furrowed deeply.

""If Maxwell isn't here, then this farce ends now. We'll discuss the wedding again some other time.""

I snapped my head up, staring at her in disbelief. She dismissed the wedding I had dreamed of for so long as a farce.

""An orphan with no parents, brought into the Fergusons by Katherine and still so ungrateful.""

""Maxwell has met plenty of flirtatious women like her; no wonder he prefers someone sweet and innocent like Chelsea Sadler.""

The words from below the stage pierced my heart like sharp swords. I didn't know how I dazedly returned home. When I pushed open the door, I saw Maxwell sitting on the sofa.

""Chelsea's turtle went on a hunger strike today, so I went to the pet hospital to look.""

""Did anything go wrong with the wedding?""

I looked up at him. His shirt was disheveled, his neck covered in love bites and he hadn't even zipped up his pants. He looked utterly satisfied.

As if he noticed my gaze, Maxwell deliberately pulled his collar down, showing a few scratches on his collarbone.

""Chelsea's so delicate. Just a few rounds and she already scratched me like this,"" he said with a tone of complaint and pride.

I was the adopted daughter-in-law brought home by Katherine Ferguson. Since I was young, I was taught to obey Maxwell. He wouldn't even allow me to make any noise during intimacy because he found it annoying.

""She's not like you. She is delicate and fragile. She can't handle all those wild moves.""

Maxwell mostly used me for release when he was with me and all sorts of props filled the room.

But he only had tenderness towards Chelsea, unwilling to hurt her even a little.

Countless times after, I would be covered in injuries, bleeding nonstop and Maxwell would only coldly leave a ""how boring"" before leaving the room.

The doctor said I had a ruptured corpus luteum and couldn't engage in strenuous activities anymore. When Maxwell found out, he angrily scolded me for being delicate.

He had initially planned to take Chelsea hiking. Still, because she was weak, Maxwell wanted me to go and carry water and equipment for them.

""You're tough as nails, yet you can't even handle a hike?"" Maxwell's angry voice seemed to ring in my ears again.

""Today was supposed to be our wedding,"" I said, trembling as I looked at him.

His face stiffened and he irritably put out his cigarette.

""It's just a wedding.""

""Chelsea's turtle could die if it doesn't eat. That's a life, you know.""

""Suzanne, when did you become so cruel?"" He didn't even spare me a glance as he turned and walked upstairs.

I didn't even notice when the tears began to fall.

The Maxwell of the past would give his own room to me, a newly arrived orphan; knowing I was allergic to strawberries, he wouldn't allow any strawberries to appear in the Ferguson household; when others called me an adopted daughter-in-law, he broke that person's leg with a kick.

Now, all those exceptions belonged to his little secretary, Chelsea Sadler.

Ding!

The special notification sound on my phone rang. Since I came to the Fergusons, Maxwell had pinned my contact and set it to special notifications.

I clicked open the notification and saw Maxwell had posted a picture on social media. Two hands intertwined with the caption: A forced marriage can't compare to spending time with my little turtle.



Chapter 2

Beneath the photo were comments from our mutual friends.

""Maxwell, aren't you scared your little wifey will get mad if you post this?""

""Max and Chelsea's bathwater is fetched bucket by bucket by that adopted daughter-in-law. What's there to be scared of with a woman like that?""

Maxwell liked those comments and replied.

""What's the fun in someone who comes crawling the second I crook my finger?""

My mind was buzzing and the screen before me blurred.

I suddenly rushed upstairs, not even feeling the bruise on my leg from hitting the coffee table. My hand, which was about to knock, froze in mid-air because of the words inside.

""Max, will Suzanne be angry if you post something like that?""

Maxwell's voice was helpless and doting.

""She's just an adopted daughter-in-law. What right does she have to be angry about?""

""Your current task is to get pregnant with my child. When the time comes, I'll have her be your postpartum nanny to care for you.""

Chelsea seemed to say something else, making them both laugh.

But I couldn't hear anything anymore. I pushed open the door and met Chelsea's teasing gaze in the video.

""Max, your little wife is getting jealous of us.""

Maxwell also turned his head to look at me, his brows furrowed with displeasure.

""Suzanne, have you forgotten all your manners? Don't you know to knock first?""

""I should've just let those thugs take you that day. Then the Fergusons wouldn't have ended up with such a troublemaker.""

His words made my face turn pale instantly.

I was brought to this home by Katherine when I was seven years old. At that time, I was being harassed by a group of hooligans who preyed on children.

They dragged me into an alley. Their slimy, disgusting hands roam over my body.

Inside his luxury car, Maxwell suddenly spotted me. Seeing how pitiful I looked, he begged Katherine to save me.

Maxwell was my savior, so I tried my best to obey him no matter what he asked me to do.

When he and Chelsea booked a hotel room without protection, I braved the heavy rain to bring them what they needed.

Chelsea disliked that the Props packaging was soaked by the rain and she cried and demanded that I apologize; otherwise, she would go home and not be with Maxwell.

Maxwell couldn't let her leave in the heat of the moment. He forced me to kneel and bow to Chelsea, threatening to send me to those beast' beds if I didn't.

I knelt outside the hotel with a wet body. I bowed continuously as I listened to their intimate voices.

A kind-hearted person passing by couldn't bear to see me like that and gave me her coat.

The next day, when Maxwell came out with Chelsea in his arms, he saw me passed out in the hallway, covered in a drenched coat.

Chelsea kindly helped me, but screamed and pushed me away when she touched the wet coat.

My knees were scraped and the wounds on my legs were smeared with mud.

Maxwell didn't even glance at me, only tenderly holding Chelsea's hands and said to me fiercely.

""Take whatever you want, but if you dirty Chelsea's hands, you'll pay for it.""

""Max, what cheap men are you talking about?"" Chelsea's delicate voice pulled me back from my memories.

Maxwell glanced at me, then noticed Chelsea looking at me curiously. With a doting smile, he said.

""Back then, some thugs dragged her into an alley. If it weren't for me, she'd probably be the top girl at a nightclub by now.""

""Well, you'd better apologize properly to Suzanne. You've really messed with her career prospects.""

Maxwell and Chelsea laughed, giving me teasing looks.

""Maxwell, don't push it."" My vision blurred with unshed tears, my nails digging into my palms as I lifted my gaze to meet his.

The deepest wound in my heart was casually turned into a joke for Chelsea to smile at.

As soon as I said that, Maxwell's expression changed. He stormed to the door, grabbed me by the hair and dragged me in front of the phone, forcing me to face Chelsea on the video call.

""Suzanne, Chelsea was just joking around. Don't be so aggressive.""

""Apologize.""

I didn't move. I stubbornly straightened up.

Maxwell grew angry as well. He slammed my head onto the ground. I lost my balance and knelt awkwardly in front of the phone. My hair was disheveled, my face covered in tears, looking like a lunatic.

I didn't remember how I got out of that room. All I could recall was the sound of Maxwell and Chelsea laughing.

""Why don't those beasts bother someone else?""

""Max, looks like your little wife is pretty popular with men.""

I slid down the wall, slowly collapsing onto the floor. I covered my mouth tightly to keep from making a sound. My eyes were so full of tears that I couldn't see anything clearly.

I pulled out my phone and searched my contacts until I found the old chat history.

\[I've changed my mind. Let's get married.\]



Chapter 3

The reply came almost instantly. I threw the buzzing phone aside, forced myself to my feet and returned to the room.

The door flew open in the middle of the night with a loud bang. Maxwell stormed in and yanked me out of bed.

""Get up. Chelsea's here to apologize.""

Before I could even fully wake up, he dragged me into the living room.

Chelsea was all dressed up and glowing. When she saw me, she smiled warmly and pulled me down to sit beside her, pushing a box into my arms.

""Suzanne, I shouldn't have said those things about you.""

""Max said you love strawberry cake. I made this one myself as a peace offering.""

Only then did I look down and realize what I was holding: a cake smothered in strawberry sauce.

""I don't want it."" I slapped the cake out of her hands.

The edge of the cake box grazed Chelsea's hand, leaving a small red mark on the back of her hand. Her eyes instantly welled up with tears.

""Max, I didn't know Suzanne didn't like this.""

She spoke between sobs, large tears rolling down her cheeks.

Maxwell hurriedly hugged Chelsea to his arms and slapped me in the face.

""Suzanne! Don't push it.""

""Chelsea went out of her way to make this for you and this is how you repay her?""

He didn't hold back. I collapsed to the floor, my ears ringing.

After a long moment, I slowly got up, pressing a hand to my face.

""I'm allergic to strawberries, Maxwell. Did you forget?""

When Chelsea wasn't around, Maxwell strictly forbade anything strawberry-related in the house. He was always afraid I'd accidentally eat some.

For a second, a flicker of hesitation crossed his face. But the sound of Chelsea softly sobbing made him glare at me even more fiercely.

""Stop making excuses. You're just doing this to make things difficult for Chelsea.""

""I don't believe one bite would kill you.""

Chelsea tugged at his sleeve, speaking gently.

""Max, if Suzanne doesn't want to forgive me, that's okay. Let's forget it.""

Her pitiful tone only made Maxwell angrier. He pointed to the mess of cake on the floor.

""Eat Chelsea's cake. If you do, I'll pretend none of this ever happened.""

I looked up at him in disbelief. He didn't even glance at me, gently patting Chelsea's back to comfort her.



Chapter 4

My hand trembled as I reached for the cake on the floor, but Maxwell kicked it away.

""You ruined Chelsea's good intentions and you still have the nerve to eat it with your hands?""

I took a deep breath and lay down next to them, biting a piece of the cake with my mouth.

The strong taste of strawberries instantly filled my entire mouth. I subconsciously wanted to throw up, but Maxwell covered my mouth.

""You're not allowed to leave a single bite. Otherwise, I'll send you to those beasts' beds.""

Thinking of the people who had dragged me into the alley when I was little, my body shuddered violently. I desperately swallowed the cake in my mouth.

""Max, look, Suzanne looks like a dog.""

""Do you think she also flattered those beasts like this?"" Chelsea's piercing laughter entered my ears.

I only felt an unbearable itching on my neck and arms. Dense red rashes appeared on my exposed skin.

I have a severe strawberry allergy. Even a little bit will cause a reaction.

After finishing the entire cake, I could barely breathe. My brain was severely oxygen-deprived and I couldn't see anything in front of me.

""Dramatic.""

Maxwell kicked me. Seeing that I didn't react, he also started to panic. He wanted to call an ambulance, but Chelsea stopped him.

""Max, didn't you say Suzanne is best at pretending to be pitiful to gain sympathy?""

""Maybe she's just faking it now.""

""Max, go to my house to see the little turtle. It hasn't eaten again recently.""

Maxwell glanced at me, hesitated momentarily and then left the villa with Chelsea.

When I woke up again, I was in a hospital room, the oxygen mask on my face making me feel disoriented.

Just before I passed out, the housemaid had found me and sent me to the hospital.

""I'm sorry, Miss Sullivan. We couldn't save your child.""

The doctor's words completely stunned me.

""What child?""

The doctor frowned and shook off my hand.

""You have a severe strawberry allergy. The baby was already three months old.""

""Because you ingested too many strawberry products, the baby couldn't be saved.""

The way the doctor looked at me was like looking at an irresponsible mother.

How could I have Maxwell's child?

We clearly always took precautions. Only once, when he had a fight with Chelsea and came back wanting to vent his frustration at night.

My face paled. Just as I was about to speak, Maxwell pushed open the door and interrupted me.

Looking at my pale face, Maxwell frowned.

""Suzanne, how can you be so useless that you can't keep a child?""

""Because you lost the baby, Chelsea has already fainted from guilt.""

""If anything happens to Chelsea, I'll hold you responsible.""

Seeing that I didn't speak, Maxwell grabbed the doctor and was about to leave, saying as he walked.

""Doctor, hurry up and check on my girlfriend. She's been unconscious for three hours.""

Then, he turned his gaze to me.

""You're strong. A miscarriage isn't a big deal. Go apologize to Chelsea when she wakes up later.""

Seeing that I still didn't move, Maxwell yanked me off the hospital bed and dragged me to the next room.

A sharp pain came from my lower belly. Cold sweat poured from my forehead.

""It hurts,"" I whispered, my face pale. The wound from the miscarriage was tearing open again, leaving a trail of blood behind me.

Maxwell didn't even pause. He shoved me in front of Chelsea's hospital bed.

Chelsea had just woken up. She looked at me and shrank back in horror, diving into Maxwell's arms.

""Apologize to Chelsea.""



Chapter 5

I bit down hard on my lip, trying to endure the pain shooting through me.

""I'm sorry, it's all my fault.""

If I didn't give in to Maxwell, who knows how much more humiliation I'd have to suffer from them.

Chelsea covered her mouth in surprise, then gave me a gentle smile.

""Suzanne, it's not completely your fault that you lost the baby. I'm partly to blame, too.""

Maxwell wrapped his arms around her protectively.

""Chelsea, this has nothing to do with you. It's her body that's weak.""

I couldn't even count how often I'd heard him say that.

Whenever Chelsea hurt me over the years, she pretended to apologize. Maxwell never even listened to my side of the story. He always blamed everything on me.

She once stole a multimillion-dollar contract from the Fergusons and accused me of taking it. Because of her, the entire family hated me. Even Katherine died from the stress.

I didn't know how long I knelt there before the silence was broken by a knock on the hospital room door. Maxwell stood up and kicked me.

""Go bring the food in.""

I stumbled to bring the meal in, blood still dripping steadily down my legs.

Chelsea shifted as I approached the bedside, whether intentionally or not, knocking the scalding hot soup from my hands.

The arm that was already flushed red instantly blistered and a few drops of soup splashed onto Chelsea's hair.

Maxwell reacted instantly, shoving me to the floor and tenderly taking Chelsea's hand.

""Chelsea, does it hurt?""

Tears welled up in Chelsea's eyes as she shook her head, her gaze falling on me.

""I'm fine. You should go check on Suzanne.""

Only then did Maxwell remember that I was the culprit who had hurt Chelsea. He called the bodyguards in.

""Lock her in the basement. Don't let her out without my orders.""

The word ""basement"" made my mind go blank. I lunged forward and clung to Maxwell's pant leg, begging.

""It was all my fault! Please, don't send me down there!""

My forehead was already bleeding from hitting the floor repeatedly. Maxwell sneered coldly.

""Those men should teach you some manners.""

My face paled. Every time I disobeyed him, Maxwell would lock me in with those thugs who had once tried to assault me.

The bodyguards dragged me to the basement. Soon after, several familiar voices drifted in from outside.

I trembled, shrinking into the corner, terrified of making any sound betraying my presence.

""Well, well, looks like Miss Sullivan got tossed aside by Mr. Ferguson again, huh?""

""If you'd just come with us back then, you wouldn't suffer like this now.""

Their slimy gazes roamed over my body and their hands reached for my chest.

The basement door burst open with a bang, followed by a few muffled screams from the men above.

I cautiously looked up and seeing that familiar face brought a wave of relief before I lost consciousness.

The next time I saw Maxwell and Chelsea was at the City Hall.

""Suzanne? Who let you out?""

Maxwell frowned. In the past, when he ""punished"" me, no one had ever dared to plead for me, let alone release me privately.

""Suzanne, are you here to congratulate Max and me?"" Chelsea looked at me smugly.

""Suzanne, even if Grandma's last wish was for me to marry you, I would never be with you."" Maxwell glanced at me, scoffing.

""Would following me here make me change my mind? You're not even worth one of Chelsea's fingers.""

I smiled and raised my hand, the ring on my finger catching the light.

""I'm not here to stalk you. I'm here to get married.""



Chapter 6

Maxwell's expression shifted, his eyes fixed in disbelief on the dazzling ring on my finger.

""Married? Who did you marry?""

""You're just a childhood sweetheart I've grown tired of. Who in this circle would want you besides me?""

I watched Maxwell's growing agitation with a cold gaze, then chuckled.

""Judging by the looks of it, you two are also here to get married. Congratulations on your upcoming wedding.""

A flicker of panic crossed Maxwell's face and he subconsciously loosened his tightly clasped hand with Chelsea.

""Max."" Chelsea's eyes instantly turned red and she tugged at Maxwell's sleeve, looking utterly wronged.

""That ring ‚Ä¶ it's fake, isn't it?""

""Suzanne, are you trying to use this to make me change my mind?""

My gaze fell on the bracelet on Chelsea's wrist.

It was a wedding gift Katherine had given to Maxwell and me before she passed away.

The day before our wedding, Chelsea complained about not having any jewelry.

Maxwell had searched everywhere for bracelets and bangles, but Chelsea was unsatisfied.

Chelsea spotted the bracelet on my wrist when he asked me to deliver chicken soup to them.

Upon hearing that it was a gift from Katherine, she burst into tears, claiming that the Fergusons didn't want to acknowledge her.

They would rather give a family heirloom to a lowly orphan like me than to her.

I had knelt and bowed repeatedly, but Maxwell couldn't console her

Perhaps annoyed by her incessant whining, he yanked the bracelet off my wrist and gave it to Chelsea.

""You're just a poor orphan we kindly took in. You're not worthy of something this valuable as Chelsea is.""

I cried and told him it was the only keepsake I had left from Katherine.

He casually tossed a cheap piece of jewelry that Chelsea didn't want into my hands.

""Someone like you should be grateful you have anything at all. If you keep making trouble, you can leave the Fergusons' residence.""

As I was leaving, I saw Chelsea throw the bracelet aside like it was garbage.

That night, I received an anonymous message.

\[The thing you begged so hard for is something I can toss away without a second thought.\]

\[That old hag never wanted Max and me together, but now that she's dead, it's time for you to get out too, a little orphan.\]

The message included a picture of the bracelet and a pile of condoms thrown in a toy with suspicious-looking liquid on them.

As if sensing my gaze, Maxwell guiltily shielded Chelsea's hand.

""Suzanne, stop making a scene. I won't hold your past mistakes against you anymore. Just go home and behave. The position of Mrs. Ferguson is still yours.""

The moment he said that, Chelsea's face darkened, her eyes glaring at me with resentment.

My past mistakes?

His words made me laugh out loud in disbelief. Just as I was about to retort, my phone buzzed.

A pleasant male voice came from the other end of the line.

""Suzanne, do you need me to come help you?""

I smiled shyly and said softly.

""No need, hubby. I can handle this myself.""

The person on the other end seemed surprised by my address and after a moment of silence, a soft chuckle followed.

""Alright, I'll wait for you outside, wifey.""

Hearing his last word made my ears burn.

Just as I hung up, a large hand grabbed my wrist.

I looked up to see Maxwell's eyes bloodshot, staring intently at me.



Chapter 7

""Who's the guy you're having an affair with?""

Sensing that something was off, Chelsea quickly grabbed Maxwell's arm.

""Maxwell, didn't you say Suzanne loves to lie the most?""

""I bet she hired an actor to try and get your attention. That ring looks totally fake.""

Chelsea's gaze landed on me and she sneered.

""Suzanne, even if Max doesn't like you, you're still part of the Fergusons.""

""Hiring someone to put on a show like this is just pathetic. You're making a fool of the entire family.""

Maxwell gave me a doubtful look and then his expression shifted as if he suddenly understood. He let go of my hand and smirked.

""Suzanne, did you go this far just to make me jealous?""

""Fine, I'll go home with you tonight. Stop making a scene here.""

I stared at him, speechless. Then, I calmly pulled out a marriage certificate from my bag.

""Take a good look. I'm already married.""

""So please, Maxwell, stay away from me. I'm a married woman now.""

I made sure to emphasize the words ""married woman."" Maxwell's face visibly paled.

""Married?""

I shot him a cold glance, having lost all patience to argue with them. I turned to leave, but a force yanked my wrist, causing a sharp pain.

""Let go! Who allowed you to touch my wife?""

Just then, a man's cold and ruthless voice sounded behind me.

He was about to say something when he froze on the spot upon seeing the person behind me, his hand trembling as he released my wrist.

Yet they still choose the 10R because it‚Äôs doesn't use Lidar and that's ""the future"". I don‚Äôt really understand those statements.

In my experience ‚Äî for example with the S7 MaxV ‚Äî once a new model comes out, older ones receive no further meaningful updates. And when I look at posts, it still seems like the 10R is actually slower when it comes to navigation and cleaning. (even after updates)

The only real benefit I see is the docking station. Maintenance seems a bit easier, but that‚Äôs about it. In one review, the 10 performed better at mopping; in another, the 10R was slightly ahead.

I also don‚Äôt get how important mopping actually is. If I spill coffee on the floor, I clean it up myself ‚Äî I don‚Äôt wait for the robot to take care of it.

1lkskf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1lkskf5/my_coldhearted_husbands_regret_from_heartbreak_to/,My Coldhearted Husband‚Äôs Regret ‚Äì From Heartbreak to Healing,"Elara Vance stepped out of the car, her heart racing with anticipation. After three weeks apart from her family, she had flown to Andoria on her birthday, hoping to surprise Damien and Cora. The sprawling Thorne estate loomed before her, its grand fa√ßade a stark reminder of the wealth and power of the family she had married into.

""Welcome home, Mrs. Thorne,"" the housekeeper, Mrs. Gable, greeted her at the door with a warm smile.

""Thank you, Mrs. Gable. Where are Damien and Cora?"" Elara asked, removing her light jacket.

Mrs. Gable's smile faltered. ""Mr. Thorne is at the office. He mentioned he would be late today. Cora is in the playroom with her tutor.""

Disappointment settled in Elara's chest, but she pushed it aside. ""I'll go see Cora then.""

Walking through the familiar hallways, Elara paused outside the playroom door. Laughter drifted out ‚Äì her daughter's voice mixed with the tutor's. She entered with a bright smile.

""Cora, sweetheart! Mommy's here!""

Her six-year-old daughter looked up from her craft project, surprise rather than joy crossing her features. ""Mommy? I thought you were in New York.""

""I came to spend my birthday with you and Daddy,"" Elara explained, kneeling beside Cora's chair.

Cora's attention quickly returned to her project ‚Äì a handmade card decorated with glitter and stickers. ""Look what I'm making!""

""It's beautiful, sweetheart. Is it for Daddy?"" Elara asked, eager to connect.

""No, it's for Auntie Vivi. She's taking me to the zoo tomorrow!"" Cora exclaimed, her eyes lighting up.

Elara's smile froze. Vivienne Dubois ‚Äì Damien's not-so-secret mistress and, painfully, Elara's half-sister. ""That's... nice of her.""

""She's the best! She always brings me presents and takes me fun places,"" Cora continued, unaware of the knife twisting in her mother's heart.

""I see,"" Elara managed. ""Well, I'm here now. Maybe we can do something special together?""

Cora shrugged. ""But I already made plans with Auntie Vivi.""

The tutor, sensing the tension, discreetly excused herself.

Elara took a steadying breath. ""Cora, it's my birthday today. Don't you want to spend some time with me?""

Cora looked up, a flicker of guilt crossing her face. ""Oh. Happy birthday, Mommy."" She hesitated, then returned to her card. ""Can I finish this first? It's really important.""

More important than me, Elara thought bitterly. She stood, forcing a smile. ""Of course, sweetheart. I'll see you at dinner.""

Retreating to the master bedroom, Elara unpacked her suitcase with methodical movements, fighting back tears. She had hoped this trip would be different ‚Äì that maybe, just maybe, her husband and daughter would remember her birthday, would want to celebrate with her.

Her phone buzzed with a message from Damien: ""Working late. Don't wait for dinner.""

No acknowledgment of her arrival. No mention of her birthday. Just another dismissal.

Hours later, Elara sat alone at the dinner table, picking at her food as Cora chatted excitedly about her day with the tutor and her plans with ""Auntie Vivi.""

""Daddy said he might come to the zoo too, if he finishes his meetings,"" Cora announced.

Elara's fork clattered against her plate. ""Did he? That would be nice.""

""Uh-huh! We're going to have ice cream after, and Auntie Vivi said I could stay up late to watch the new princess movie!""

Elara nodded, her throat tight. ""That sounds wonderful, darling.""

After putting Cora to bed, Elara waited in the living room. The grandfather clock ticked away the minutes, then hours. At midnight, the front door finally opened.

Damien entered, his tall frame silhouetted against the doorway, surprise registering on his face when he saw her.

""You're still awake,"" he stated, loosening his tie.

""It's my birthday,"" Elara said softly.

His expression didn't change. ""Is it? I apologize for forgetting. Happy birthday, Elara.""

Seven years of marriage, and he couldn't remember the date. Seven years of loving him, and he couldn't muster even a hint of warmth.

""Thank you,"" she replied, her voice hollow.

""I have an early meeting tomorrow. Goodnight."" He turned toward the guest bedroom he had been occupying for months.

""Damien,"" she called after him. ""I was hoping we could have lunch together tomorrow. Since you missed dinner tonight.""

He paused. ""I'll check my schedule.""

The next morning, Elara woke early, determined to salvage something from this trip. She chose her outfit carefully ‚Äì a blue dress Damien had once commented on years ago ‚Äì and styled her hair with extra care.

Passing by Cora's room, she overheard her daughter talking on the phone.

""I can't wait to see you, Auntie Vivi! I wish you could be my mommy instead.""

Elara froze, her hand on the doorknob. The words pierced through her like physical pain.

""My real mommy is here, but she's always sad. Daddy doesn't smile when she's around. I like it better when it's just us with you.""

Backing away silently, Elara retreated to her room, the cruel words echoing in her mind. She sat on the edge of the bed, staring blankly at the wall as tears streamed down her face.

At noon, she composed herself enough to check if Damien would keep their lunch date. His assistant answered.

""I'm sorry, Mrs. Thorne. Mr. Thorne had a change of plans. He left the office an hour ago.""

Elara thanked her and hung up. On impulse, she drove to Damien's favorite restaurant. As she approached the entrance, she saw them through the window ‚Äì Damien, Vivienne, and Cora, laughing together at a corner table. The perfect family portrait, with no space for her.

Something hardened inside Elara. Seven years of hoping, waiting, trying. Seven years of watching her husband love another woman ‚Äì her own half-sister. Seven years of losing her daughter's affection to that same woman.

Enough.

She drove back to the estate with newfound clarity. In the home office, she drafted a divorce agreement ‚Äì fair, generous even. She had no interest in Damien's money or properties. She wanted only what was rightfully hers, including shared custody of Cora.

When she finished, she sealed the document in an envelope and left it on Damien's desk with his name written in her elegant handwriting.

""Mrs. Gable,"" she called, finding the housekeeper in the kitchen. ""Please ensure Mr. Thorne receives this when he returns.""

Mrs. Gable's eyes widened slightly at Elara's calm demeanor. ""Of course, Mrs. Thorne. Will you be here for dinner?""

""No,"" Elara replied, her voice steadier than it had been in years. ""I'm leaving now. Please have my luggage brought to the car.""

Outside, the driver waited by the sleek black car. ""Where to, Mrs. Thorne?""

Elara looked back at the mansion one last time, at the gilded cage she had willingly entered seven years ago.

""To the airport,"" she said firmly.

It was time to reclaim her life.

...

Damien Thorne pulled into the driveway of his estate, the sleek black car coming to a smooth stop. Beside him, Cora bounced in her seat, still bubbling with excitement from their day out.

""That was the best day ever, Daddy!"" she exclaimed, unbuckling her seatbelt with practiced ease.

Damien smiled at his daughter. ""I'm glad you enjoyed it, princess.""

As they entered the grand foyer, Mrs. Gable approached them, her expression unreadable. ""Welcome home, Mr. Thorne, Miss Cora.""

""Mrs. Gable,"" Damien nodded, handing her his coat. ""Any calls?""

""Mrs. Thorne was here earlier today,"" she replied, her tone carefully neutral.

Cora's eyes widened. ""Mommy was here? Did she leave already?""

""Yes, Miss Cora. She left for the airport about two hours ago.""

Damien frowned slightly. ""I wasn't aware she was planning to visit.""

""She said it was a surprise,"" Mrs. Gable explained. ""She seemed quite upset when she left.""

Cora shrugged, already losing interest. ""Good. I didn't want her to ruin our plans with Auntie Vivi tomorrow.""

""Cora,"" Damien admonished gently, though without much conviction. He turned back to Mrs. Gable. ""Did she say why she was upset?""

""No, sir."" Mrs. Gable hesitated before adding, ""But she left this for you."" She handed him a cream-colored envelope with his name written in Elara's elegant handwriting.

Damien took it, turning it over in his hands with mild curiosity. ""Thank you, Mrs. Gable.""

""Daddy, can I watch my movie now?"" Cora asked, tugging at his sleeve.

""Of course. I'll be in my office if you need me.""

Damien walked to his study, envelope in hand. He placed it on his desk, intending to read it after checking his emails. Elara was probably just upset about him forgetting her birthday. It wouldn't be the first time she had written him a letter expressing her disappointment.

Before he could open it, his phone rang. Vivienne's name flashed on the screen.

""Vivienne,"" he answered, a smile warming his voice.

""I was just calling to say how much I enjoyed today,"" her sultry voice came through. ""And to confirm our plans for tomorrow.""

""Of course. Cora can't stop talking about the zoo.""

""I can't wait. And what about tonight?"" she asked suggestively.

Damien glanced at the envelope, then pushed it aside. ""I can be there in an hour.""

""Perfect. Don't keep me waiting too long.""

After the call, Damien gathered what he needed for the night. The envelope lay forgotten on his desk as he left, his mind already occupied with thoughts of Vivienne.

\---

Morning sunlight filtered through the blinds of Elara's apartment in the city. She had purchased it years ago as an investment property, never thinking she would one day use it as her escape.

The space was sparsely furnished but elegant, much like Elara herself. She had spent the night methodically unpacking the essentials she had brought from New York ‚Äì clothes, toiletries, a few cherished books.

Sitting at her dining table with a cup of tea, she opened her laptop and logged into her bank account. With steady hands, she transferred just over three million dollars from her personal account to a new one she had created yesterday.

It was money Damien had given her over the years ‚Äì ""spending money,"" he had called it. Money she had barely touched, preferring to earn her own salary as head of his secretarial team.

""It's not about the money,"" she whispered to herself, closing her laptop with finality.

Her phone vibrated with an incoming call. For a heartbeat, she wondered if it might be Damien, finally noticing her absence. But the screen showed Chloe's name instead.

""Hey,"" Elara answered, her voice steadier than she expected.

""You did it, didn't you?"" Chloe asked without preamble. ""You finally left him.""

""Yes.""

""God, it's about time!"" Chloe's relief was palpable through the phone. ""Where are you now? Do you need anything?""

""I'm at my apartment in the city. I'm fine, Chloe."" Elara's gaze drifted to the unpacked boxes. ""Better than fine, actually.""

""Have you heard from him yet?""

""No. I doubt he's even noticed I'm gone."" The truth of that statement didn't hurt as much as she thought it would.

""What about Cora?""

Elara's heart tightened. ""I usually call her every night when I'm away. I didn't call last night.""

""And?""

""And nothing. No missed calls. No messages asking where I am."" Elara took a steadying breath. ""It's clearer than ever that I'm not needed in that house.""

""You're doing the right thing, El. It's time you put yourself first for once.""

After ending the call, Elara showered and dressed with care. She chose a simple navy blue dress that she hadn't worn in years ‚Äì something professional but distinctly not part of her ""Mrs. Thorne"" wardrobe.

She had one more tie to sever.

\---

Thorne Industries occupied the top floors of a gleaming skyscraper in the heart of the financial district. Elara had worked there for the past five years, rising to head of the secretarial team through genuine talent and dedication, despite the whispers about nepotism.

She bypassed the executive elevators she usually took with Damien, instead joining other employees in the main lift. A few gave her curious glances ‚Äì Mrs. Thorne rarely came in without her husband, and never dressed so... ordinarily.

Marcus Cole, the Human Resources Director, looked up in surprise when she knocked on his door.

""Mrs. Thorne! I wasn't expecting you today.""

""Please, call me Elara,"" she said, taking a seat across from him. ""I won't be Mrs. Thorne much longer.""

Marcus blinked, clearly caught off guard. ""I... see.""

She placed a sealed envelope on his desk. ""My resignation, effective immediately. I've already prepared detailed handover notes for my team.""

""This is quite sudden,"" Marcus said, picking up the envelope cautiously, as if it might burn him. ""Does Mr. Thorne know about this?""

""He will soon enough."" Elara's smile was small but resolute. ""I've accumulated quite a bit of vacation time. I'd like to use that instead of working through a notice period, if that's acceptable.""

Marcus nodded slowly, still processing. ""Of course. That's perfectly within company policy.""

""Thank you. I've already cleared out my desk."" She stood, extending her hand. ""It's been a pleasure working with you, Marcus.""

He took her hand, his expression a mix of confusion and concern. ""Likewise, Mrs... Elara. If you don't mind my asking, what do you plan to do now?""

For the first time in years, Elara smiled without restraint. ""I'm going back to where I belong.""

As she left his office, Elara felt a weight lifting from her shoulders. Seven years of trying to be the perfect wife to a man who didn't want her. Seven years of dimming her own light to accommodate his indifference.

No more.

Her phone vibrated in her purse. She checked the screen ‚Äì Julian Croft, her old college friend and business partner, the man she had abandoned her dreams for when she married Damien.

""Perfect timing,"" she murmured, answering the call as she stepped into the elevator. ""Julian? Yes, it's done. I'm coming home.""

The elevator doors closed on Elara Vance ‚Äì not Thorne ‚Äì standing tall, her face set with quiet determination as she descended away from the empire her husband had built, toward the life she had once forsaken.

...

Marcus Cole stared at the resignation letter long after Elara had departed. He had witnessed the cold dynamic between Damien Thorne and his wife for years. The countless times she had waited patiently outside his office door. The way her face would light up with hope at just a moment of his acknowledgment. The inevitable disappointment when that moment never came.

He slipped the envelope into Damien's inbox, knowing full well it might sit there for days before being noticed. Damien Thorne rarely checked items that didn't come with urgent flags from his assistants.

Marcus remembered when Elara first joined Thorne Industries. Despite being the CEO's wife, she had started at an entry-level position, refusing special treatment. Her intelligence and dedication had quickly propelled her up the ranks to head of the secretarial team.

All of it, Marcus knew, had been for Damien's attention. Attention that never materialized.

His intercom buzzed. ""Mr. Cole, Mr. Thorne is requesting the quarterly projections.""

""I'll bring them right in,"" Marcus replied, gathering the requested documents.

When he entered Damien's office, the CEO barely looked up from his computer.

""Just leave them there,"" Damien said, gesturing vaguely to the corner of his desk.

Marcus placed the folder down, noticing the unopened cream-colored envelope still sitting where Mrs. Gable had left it yesterday. Beside it was Elara's resignation letter, also unopened.

""Will Mrs. Thorne be joining you for the charity gala next week?"" Marcus asked, testing the waters.

Damien's brow furrowed slightly. ""I assume so. Why?""

""No reason,"" Marcus replied. ""The event coordinator was asking about final headcounts.""

Damien nodded dismissively, already refocused on his screen. Marcus left quietly, deciding against mentioning Elara's resignation. The man would discover it soon enough.

\---

Elara placed a potted peace lily on her kitchen counter, adjusting it until she was satisfied with its position. Sunlight streamed through the windows of her apartment, illuminating the space she was gradually making her own.

Her phone chimed with a text from Chloe: ""Lunch tomorrow? Need all the details!""

Elara smiled, typing back a quick confirmation. She set her phone down and surveyed the groceries she'd just purchased. For the first time in years, she had bought only what she liked, without considering Damien's preferences or Cora's picky habits.

The thought of Cora sent a pang through her heart. Three days had passed since she'd left the Thorne mansion, and she hadn't received a single call from her daughter. Not even to ask where she was.

She pushed the painful thought aside and began putting away her groceries. The refrigerator looked pathetically empty with just her items, but there was something liberating about it too. This space was entirely hers.

After finishing, Elara settled on her couch and picked up her phone again. She scrolled through her contacts until she found the number she needed.

""Hello, Sandra? It's Elara Vance,"" she said when the call connected. ""Yes, it's been a while... I was wondering if you could reserve a ticket for me for the TechFuture Exhibition next week? I'm planning to attend this year.""

She listened to the response, a small smile forming on her lips. ""Yes, that's right. I'm coming back to YodaVision. Julian and I have discussed it... No, I'm not with Thorne Industries anymore.""

The conversation continued as Elara confirmed details about the exhibition. When she hung up, she felt a surge of excitement. The tech world had been her passion before marriage, before she'd set aside her dreams to be Damien's perfect wife.

The rest of her day passed in a blur of productivity. She organized her home office, contacted old colleagues, and reviewed the latest developments in artificial intelligence that she had missed during her years away.

That evening, she realized she hadn't checked her personal email all day. She opened her inbox to find it disappointingly empty of any messages from Damien or Cora. Not even to ask where she was or why she hadn't come home.

Elara closed her laptop with a sigh. It shouldn't surprise her, but somehow the complete silence still stung. Had she really meant so little to them that her absence didn't even warrant a question?

\---

In Andoria, Cora's face crumpled as Vivienne zipped her suitcase closed.

""Why can't you stay longer?"" Cora pleaded, trailing after Vivienne as she moved around the luxurious hotel suite.

""I have to get back, sweetie,"" Vivienne replied, checking her reflection in the mirror. ""I have important meetings that can't wait.""

""But I don't want you to go!"" Cora's voice rose to a wail. ""It's not fair!""

Damien entered from the adjoining room, his expression softening at the sight of his distraught daughter. ""Cora, we've talked about this. Vivienne has responsibilities back home.""

""Then I want to go home too!"" Cora stomped her foot. ""I hate it here without Vivi!""

Vivienne knelt down, brushing Cora's hair back. ""I'll see you again soon, I promise. And you still have your daddy here.""

""It's not the same!"" Tears streamed down Cora's face. ""I want to go home now!""

Damien exchanged a glance with Vivienne before lifting Cora into his arms. ""Actually,"" he said calmly, ""we're going back next week.""

Cora's sobs quieted. ""Really?""

""Yes,"" Damien confirmed. ""I've already made arrangements to wrap up business here early.""

""Will you be at our house when we get back?"" Cora asked Vivienne eagerly.

Vivienne smiled, her perfectly manicured hand resting briefly on Damien's arm. ""I might just be.""

Damien's phone vibrated in his pocket. He shifted Cora to his other arm and checked the screen. It was Marcus Cole. He declined the call, making a mental note to check in with him later.

""Now, let's get Vivienne to the airport,"" he said, setting Cora down. ""And if you're good, we can get ice cream afterward.""

As they left the suite, Damien's thoughts turned briefly to the work awaiting him back home. Not once did he wonder about Elara. Not once did he consider what he might find upon his return.

The elevator doors closed on the three of them ‚Äì Vivienne elegant and composed, Cora still sniffling but calmer, and Damien unaware of the seismic shift that awaited him back home.

In her apartment across the ocean, Elara continued her quiet revolution, preparing for a future she was finally brave enough to claim for herself. A future that would soon collide with the past she thought she had left behind.

...

Cora clutched her phone tightly, her thumb hovering over her mother's contact. She had already ended the call once, and now guilt gnawed at her. Dad and Vivienne were chatting in the next room, their voices a low murmur through the hotel wall.

She flopped back on the bed with a sigh. Mom would definitely ask questions. And if Cora mentioned Vivienne was coming back with them, Mom would get that tight look on her face‚Äîthe one where her smile didn't reach her eyes.

Her phone buzzed suddenly. Mom calling back.

Panic flared in Cora's chest. She silenced the phone and shoved it under her pillow. The screen glowed briefly before going dark.

""Cora? Are you packed?"" Her father's voice called from the doorway.

She sat up quickly. ""Almost done, Dad.""

Damien stepped into the room, his tall figure casting a shadow across the carpet. ""Good. Vivienne's driver will be here soon.""

""I can't wait to get home,"" Cora said, excitement bubbling up again. ""And Vivi's really going to visit us there?""

Her father's face softened slightly. ""Yes, she'll be staying at the house for a while.""

""Mom won't like that,"" Cora mumbled before she could stop herself.

A flicker of irritation crossed Damien's face. ""Your mother doesn't dictate who visits our home.""

Something about his tone made Cora look down. She knew things weren't good between her parents. They barely talked anymore, and when they did, the air felt cold and heavy.

""Have you spoken to your mother today?"" Damien asked, his voice neutral.

Cora shook her head quickly. ""No. She's probably busy with work stuff.""

He nodded, seeming satisfied with her answer. ""Finish packing. We leave for the airport in thirty minutes.""

When he left, Cora pulled out her phone again. Three missed calls from Mom. She bit her lip, then turned the phone off completely.

\---

Elara stared at her silent phone, anxiety building with each unanswered call. It wasn't like Cora to call and hang up. What if something was wrong?

She paced her apartment, debating whether to call Damien. Their agreement had been minimal contact except regarding Cora, but surely this qualified.

Before she could decide, her phone rang. Hope surged until she saw Mrs. Gable's name on the screen.

""Hello, Mrs. Gable,"" she answered quickly. ""Have you heard from Cora? She called me but hung up, and now she's not answering.""

""Miss Cora is fine, ma'am,"" Mrs. Gable assured her. ""I just spoke with her. They're preparing to leave for the airport.""

Relief flooded through Elara. ""Thank you. Did she say why she called me?""

""No, ma'am. But children are fickle with their attentions,"" Mrs. Gable said kindly. ""Will you be needing anything from the house today?""

Elara shook her head, then remembered she was on the phone. ""No, thank you. I'm all settled in the apartment now.""

After hanging up, she walked to her window. The city sprawled below, busy and indifferent to her worries. She'd made the right choice leaving, she reminded herself. But moments like these‚Äîwhen the distance between her and Cora felt vast‚Äîmade her doubt.

Her doorbell rang, startling her from her thoughts.

Her neighbor, Clara Hayes, stood in the hallway holding a plate of cookies. ""Thought you might like something homemade,"" she said with a warm smile.

Elara accepted the plate gratefully. ""That's very kind of you.""

Clara waved dismissively. ""It's nothing. I remember how it was starting over on my own after my divorce. Sometimes a friendly face makes all the difference.""

They chatted for a few minutes before Clara excused herself. Elara placed the cookies on her counter, oddly touched by the simple gesture. It had been ages since someone had done something nice for her without an agenda.

\---

Later that afternoon, Elara's phone chimed with an email notification. Crestwood College was celebrating its centennial next week. Her alma mater. The place where she'd first fallen in love with artificial intelligence‚Äîand where she'd met Julian.

On impulse, she decided to visit the campus. Perhaps walking those familiar paths would help quiet the restlessness inside her.

The university hadn't changed much. Ivy still clung to the old brick buildings. Students lounged on the grass, absorbed in their devices or conversations. Elara felt a pang of nostalgia as she passed the computer science building where she'd spent countless hours coding and theorizing.

""Elara? Elara Vance?""

She turned at the sound of her name. A tall man with dark-rimmed glasses was staring at her in disbelief.

""Julian,"" she breathed, recognizing him instantly despite the years.

Julian Croft's face broke into a wide grin. ""I thought that was you! What are you doing here?""

""Just reminiscing,"" she said, suddenly self-conscious. ""The alumni email about the centennial made me nostalgic.""

""Well, this is perfect timing. I've been meaning to reach out to you."" His eyes sparkled with excitement. ""Have time for coffee? The old caf√© is still there.""

Twenty minutes later, they sat at a corner table in the campus caf√©, steaming mugs between them. Julian hadn't changed much‚Äîstill animated when he talked, hands gesturing to emphasize his points.

""So, YodaVision has expanded into predictive healthcare AI,"" he explained. ""The algorithms we started developing in grad school? They're the foundation for systems now being tested in hospitals across the country.""

Pride swelled in Elara's chest. ""That's amazing, Julian. You've accomplished so much.""

""We started it together,"" he reminded her. ""Your theoretical framework was revolutionary. I've just been building on it."" He paused, studying her face. ""Why did you leave, Elara? You were the visionary between us.""

The question hung in the air. Elara traced the rim of her mug with her finger. ""Marriage. Life. Choices that seemed right at the time.""

""And now?""

She looked up at him. ""Now I'm getting divorced.""

Julian's expression softened. ""I'm sorry.""

""Don't be,"" she said quickly. ""It's been a long time coming.""

A silence fell between them, comfortable despite the years apart.

""What will you do now?"" Julian finally asked.

Elara shrugged. ""Start over, I suppose. Though where, I'm not sure. The tech world moves so fast. I've been out of it for six years.""

Julian leaned forward, his eyes intense. ""Come back to YodaVision.""

""What?"" The suggestion caught her off guard.

""I'm serious. We need you. The company needs you. We've grown, but we've never found someone with your vision.""

Elara shook her head. ""Julian, I wouldn't even know where to begin. The field has advanced so much‚Äî""

""You'll catch up,"" he interrupted. ""You were always the quickest learner I knew.""

""It's not that simple,"" Elara protested. ""I've been working as a secretary, for God's sake. My skills are rusty at best, obsolete at worst.""

""So you'll refresh them,"" Julian countered. ""Look, we have a project right now that could benefit enormously from your perspective. It's a perfect re-entry point.""

Elara felt a flutter of something she hadn't experienced in years‚Äîexcitement mingled with fear. The idea of returning to AI work was both thrilling and terrifying.

""I don't know,"" she said honestly. ""What if I can't do it anymore? What if I've lost whatever talent I had?""

Julian reached across the table, covering her hand with his. ""You haven't. Talent like yours doesn't disappear.""

""Six years is a long time,"" she insisted. ""The industry has changed completely.""

""But the fundamentals haven't. And neither has your mind."" Julian squeezed her hand before withdrawing. ""Just come tour the lab. Meet the team. No pressure, just see what we're working on.""

Elara hesitated, memories of her last days at YodaVision flooding back. She'd left to focus on her marriage to Damien, believing it was the right choice. What a fool she'd been.

""What position would I even fill?"" she asked, her voice small.

""Head of Research and Development,"" Julian replied without hesitation. ""The role has been waiting for you.""

""You can't be serious."" Elara stared at him. ""You've kept a C-suite position open for six years?""

""Not officially open,"" he admitted. ""But no one's been right for it. Not the way you would be.""

The confidence in his voice made something shift inside her. Could she really do this? Return to the field she'd abandoned, take leadership of cutting-edge research? The thought was simultaneously exhilarating and terrifying.

Julian watched her, patient but eager. ""Say yes, Elara. Come back where you belong.""

She opened her mouth, but fear froze the words in her throat. The enormity of what he was offering‚Äîa chance to reclaim her former passion, her expertise‚Äîcollided with the crushing self-doubt that had grown during her years with Damien.

""But I... I..."" Her voice trailed off, revealing the depth of her uncertainty. Could she really step back into that world after so long away? Or would she fail spectacularly, confirming what a part of her had feared all along‚Äîthat she had sacrificed her brilliance for a marriage that had never truly existed?

...

Elara sat frozen across from Julian, his offer hanging between them. Once, she would have jumped at this opportunity without hesitation. Now, doubt clouded her mind like a thick fog.

""Elara?"" Julian leaned forward. ""Talk to me.""

She took a deep breath. ""It's been so long, Julian. I gave up everything for my marriage. What if I can't get it back?""

""The Elara I knew wouldn't ask that question."" His eyes held hers steadily. ""She'd roll up her sleeves and prove everyone wrong.""

A flicker of the old fire stirred in her chest. ""That Elara disappeared years ago.""

""I don't believe that."" Julian tapped the table between them. ""The work you did on neural network applications was revolutionary. That brilliance doesn't just vanish.""

Elara stared into her coffee cup. For years, she'd suppressed her ambitions to be the perfect wife and mother. A wife Damien barely noticed. A mother Cora increasingly pushed away.

""What would I even bring to the table now?"" she asked quietly.

Julian pulled out his tablet and showed her the company's latest projects. ""We've expanded, but we're struggling with the intuitive interface algorithms you were developing before you left.""

As he explained their challenges, Elara found herself instinctively analyzing the problems. Her mind raced with potential solutions, connections forming like they used to years ago.

""You could approach it from a different angle,"" she said without thinking. ""If you restructured the decision trees to incorporate emotional intelligence patterns...""

Julian grinned. ""See? Still brilliant.""

Warmth spread through her chest‚Äînot from embarrassment, but recognition. This was who she used to be. Who she could be again.

""When would you need me to start?"" The words surprised even her.

Julian's eyes widened. ""Is that a yes?""

She straightened her shoulders. ""It's a maybe. I need to think about logistics.""

""Take the weekend,"" Julian said quickly. ""But I want you in the lab on Monday. Just to look around, meet everyone. No pressure.""

Elara nodded slowly. ""I can do that.""

As they said goodbye outside the caf√©, Julian hugged her. ""It's good to see you again, Elara. The real you.""

His words echoed in her mind as she walked across campus. The real her. Had she been living as someone else these past years?

Her phone buzzed. A text from Eleanor Thorne: ""Family dinner this Sunday. Mandatory attendance.""

Elara sighed. Eleanor's ""mandatory"" family dinners were becoming more frequent since Elara moved out. An obvious attempt to force her and Damien together.

Before she could respond, another message appeared‚Äîthis one from Sabrina Thorne, Damien's sister.

""Are you at Crestwood? Leo's friend thought he saw you.""

Elara frowned. Leo was Sabrina's son who attended Crestwood. How typical of Sabrina to keep tabs on her.

""Yes, visiting my alma mater,"" she replied simply.

Three dots appeared immediately. ""Meet me at the alumni center. I'm here for a committee meeting.""

It wasn't a request. Elara considered ignoring it, but decided against creating unnecessary tension. With renewed confidence from her conversation with Julian, she headed toward the alumni center.

Sabrina stood outside, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, tapping her designer heel impatiently. When she spotted Elara, her eyebrows rose.

""What are you doing here?"" she asked without preamble.

Elara kept her voice even. ""Hello to you too, Sabrina.""

""Don't you have work? Or are you still taking that 'break' from Thorne Industries?"" Sabrina made air quotes around the word ""break.""

""I'm exploring other opportunities,"" Elara replied.

Sabrina snorted. ""Like what? You've been Damien's secretary for years.""

""I was head of the secretarial department,"" Elara corrected. ""And before that, I was in artificial intelligence research.""

""Right."" Sabrina clearly didn't believe her. ""Well, since you're here, you can do me a favor. Leo's been complaining about cafeteria food. Could you make him those dumplings he likes? I'll have him stop by the house tomorrow.""

The old Elara would have agreed immediately. But Julian's words rang in her ears: ""The real you.""

""I'm afraid I can't,"" she said firmly. ""I have plans tomorrow.""

Sabrina blinked, clearly surprised by the refusal. ""What plans?""

""Personal ones."" Elara shifted her purse strap. ""Besides, I've moved out temporarily, as you know.""

""Temporarily,"" Sabrina echoed with a raised eyebrow. ""Is that what we're calling it?""

Before Elara could respond, two elegantly dressed women approached Sabrina.

""There you are!"" one of them called. ""We're about to discuss the donor wall.""

""Coming,"" Sabrina replied, then gestured vaguely toward Elara. ""This is... a friend. Elara.""

A friend. Not sister-in-law. Not even by her full name. Just ""a friend.""

The slight was calculated, designed to diminish her. Six months ago, it would have worked. Today, it merely reinforced her decision.

""Nice meeting you,"" Elara said pleasantly to the women. ""I need to get going. I have a business meeting to prepare for.""

She walked away before Sabrina could respond, her stride purposeful. With each step, her resolve strengthened. She pulled out her phone and dialed Julian.

""It's Elara,"" she said when he answered. ""I'll take the job. No need to wait until Monday.""

Julian's whoop of joy made her smile. ""That's the best news I've had all year! I'll email you the paperwork tonight.""

As she ended the call, a weight lifted from her shoulders. For the first time in years, she was making a decision solely for herself. Not for Damien, not for the Thorne family reputation. For Elara Vance.

\---

Two weeks later, Damien Thorne pulled into the driveway of his mansion, Cora chattering excitedly in the passenger seat.

""And then Vivienne said we could go riding again next weekend!"" Cora bounced in her seat. ""Do you think Mom will want to come too?""

Damien tensed slightly at the mention of Elara. ""Your mother isn't much for horseback riding.""

""She could watch,"" Cora insisted. ""I want to show her how good I am now.""

He didn't respond as they entered the house. Mr. Finch, the butler, greeted them in the foyer.

""Welcome home, sir. Miss Cora,"" he said formally. ""How was your trip?""

""The best!"" Cora declared. ""Where's Mom? I want to tell her everything!""

Mr. Finch hesitated. ""Mrs. Thorne isn't here at present.""

Damien frowned. ""Where is she?""

""Mrs. Thorne left on a business trip shortly after you departed,"" Mr. Finch explained. ""She called to check on Miss Cora several times.""

""A business trip?"" Damien repeated. ""What business trip?""

""I'm not privy to the details, sir,"" Mr. Finch said carefully. ""But she mentioned it would last approximately two weeks.""

""Two weeks?"" Damien raised an eyebrow. Elara had never taken a business trip in their entire marriage. Her work at Thorne Industries certainly didn't require travel.

""When will she be back?"" Cora asked, disappointment evident in her voice.

""I believe tomorrow or the day after, Miss."" Mr. Finch turned to Damien. ""Would you like me to try reaching her?""

Damien considered this. Two weeks was an unusually long absence for Elara, who typically revolved her schedule around Cora's needs. Still, he supposed she was entitled to whatever this was‚Äîperhaps some retreat related to the temporary separation she'd requested.

""No need,"" he said dismissively. ""I'm sure she'll be in touch when she returns.""

""But Dad,"" Cora protested. ""I want to tell her about the horses now.""

""You can tell her when she gets back,"" Damien replied, already checking his phone for emails. ""Go unpack your things.""

As Cora reluctantly headed upstairs, Mr. Finch cleared his throat.

""Sir, if I may... Mrs. Thorne seemed different before she left.""

Damien looked up sharply. ""Different how?""

""More..."" Mr. Finch seemed to search for the right word. ""Determined.""

""Determined,"" Damien repeated flatly.

""Yes, sir. And she took quite a few of her personal belongings.""

Damien processed this information silently. Their separation had been Elara's idea‚Äîa ""temporary arrangement"" to give them both space. He had agreed easily enough, seeing no reason to object. Their marriage had been one of convenience from the start.

""Alright,"" he said simply, turning toward his study. ""Have Mrs. Powell prepare dinner for six. Vivienne will be joining us.""

""Very good, sir,"" Mr. Finch replied.

As Damien walked away, he felt a fleeting twinge of something unusual‚Äînot quite concern, but a vague discomfort with the situation. Elara had always been predictable, dependable. This sudden two-week absence without detailed explanation was out of character.

He dismissed the thought almost immediately. If Elara needed space, so be it. It changed nothing about his plans or priorities.

Still, as he settled behind his desk, Damien found himself staring at her empty chair across the hall in the small office she sometimes used at home. For the briefest moment, he wondered exactly what kind of ""business"" had taken her away for so long.

Then his phone rang with an important call, and the thought vanished entirely.",1,1750917689.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Background:

6+ years in various domains - devsecops, pentesting, OT

Materials:

- OSG 
- Boson 
- QE
- Official CISSP test papers
- Prabh Nair coffee shots

Exam was tough , it had a lot of questions/sections which I felt I was not prepared for. Reading and re reading it thoroughly helped me answer a few. Mine was IAM heavy, multiple back to back questions on IAM and threat modeling concepts. SDLC was tested multiple times but indirectly. There were a lot of questions which needed knowledge of multiple domains. In the end I was able to clear it at 100 with 45 mins left.

I am really happy that finally I am able to write my success story ! Looking forward to a great and stress free weekend.

1lksjwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonfictionbookclub/comments/1lksjwo/how_i_went_from_reading_0_books_to_50_books_a/,How I went from reading 0 books to 50+ books a year (without speed reading bs),"wo years ago i was one of those people who bought books and let them collect dust. had a whole shelf of ""books i'll read someday"" that never got touched. now i'm reading 4-5 books a month and actually retaining what i read. here's how i cracked the code:

the mindset shift that changed everything:

* stopped trying to read ""impressive"" books and started reading stuff i actually wanted to read. turns out enjoying what ur reading makes u want to read more (who knew)
* realized reading 10 mins a day consistently beats reading 3 hours once a week. consistency > intensity
* gave myself permission to quit books that sucked. life's too short for boring books, there's literally millions of other options
* started treating books like netflix - if i'm not hooked in the first 30 pages, i move on. no guilt, no forcing it

the practical systems that actually work:

* always have 3 books going: one physical, one audiobook, one ebook. different moods, different formats
* bought a kindle paperwhite and it changed my life. reading in bed without disturbing anyone, built-in light, holds thousands of books
* started using library apps (libby is a game changer). free books delivered to ur phone, what's not to love
* created a ""books to read"" note in my phone. when someone recommends something or i see an interesting title, i add it immediately

the habit stacking stuff:

* read while drinking my morning coffee. 15-20 mins every day, no exceptions
* audiobooks during commute, walks, doing dishes, working out. turns dead time into reading time
* keep a book in my bag always. waiting for appointments, delayed flights, random free moments = reading opportunities
* read for 10 mins before bed instead of scrolling. better sleep + more books, win-win

the environment hacks:

* made reading more appealing than my phone. comfy reading spot, good lighting, put the phone in another room
* started going to bookstores/libraries just to browse. being around books makes u want to read them
* joined a book club (online one bc social anxiety). having to discuss books makes u actually think about them
* unfollowed book reviewers who made me feel bad about my reading choices. read what u want, not what's ""supposed"" to be good

the retention tricks:

* started keeping a reading journal. not fancy, just a few sentences about what i learned or thought about each book
* began taking notes while reading (especially non-fiction). kindle makes this super easy
* started telling people about books i'm reading. explaining stuff to others helps cement it in ur brain
* created a ""book graveyard"" list of books i didn't finish. helps me remember what didn't work and why

the advanced stuff:

* learned about different reading speeds for different content. skim self-help for main points, savor fiction for experience
* started reading book summaries AFTER finishing books to see what i missed. helps improve comprehension over time
* began choosing books based on what i'm dealing with in life. relationship issues? read about psychology. career stress? read about productivity
* discovered ""book sprints"" - dedicating a whole saturday to finishing one book. surprisingly effective for shorter books

the counterintuitive stuff:

* stopped setting yearly reading goals. pressure killed the enjoyment, made it feel like work
* started re-reading favorite books. repetition with favorites > constantly consuming new mediocre content
* began reading multiple books in the same topic area. reinforces concepts and gives different perspectives
* learned that it's okay to read ""easy"" books. young adult fiction counts, graphic novels count, everything counts

what didn't work:

* speed reading courses - just made me anxious and killed comprehension
* forcing myself to read before bed when i was exhausted - just made me hate reading
* trying to read only ""important"" books - boredom killed the habit before it started
* reading in noisy environments - couldn't focus, got frustrated, gave up

went from maybe 2-3 books a year to 50+ books. not just reading more, but actually enjoying it and remembering what i read. brain feels sharper, conversations are more interesting, and i have way more perspective on stuff.

curious what the biggest barrier is for most people. i fixed mine and read a lo this year. hoped you liked this post",5,1750917645.0,nonfictionbookclub,1,0.86,False

Blair was so grateful to be home. She just didn‚Äôt understand the demon that had possessed her boss during their recent business trip. He had driven everyone hard. They arrived home one day earlier than planned, but she was glad to be away from him.

She had expected to return to the office with him. To her surprise, he gave her the rest of the afternoon off. Maybe he‚Äôd decided they both needed a break. That was fine by her.

Lately, he‚Äôd been a real shithead. Short-tempered and demanding. When he dropped her off at her front door, she almost flipped him the bird. She paused, unsure whether he‚Äôd catch the gesture in the rear-view mirror.

Roman had this uncanny ability to sense everything. It was almost like he had eyes in the back of his head. You‚Äôd think being gorgeous would make him a bit easier to work with. But no. If anything, it made him more of an ass. He was hot, and he knew it. Most everyone always fell at his feet trying to please the man.

She didn‚Äôt know what was going on. Roman had seemed more irritable in the past few months. He‚Äôd been rubbing her the wrong way. Of the two years she‚Äôd worked for him, these last two months had been the worst. If he didn‚Äôt pay her so well, or if she didn‚Äôt need the job so badly, maybe she would tell him where to go.

Blair shook her head. That wasn‚Äôt true. Despite his sometimes shitty attitude, Roman did look after his staff. The benefits at Kingston‚Äôs were great. People put up with more for the right perks.

The office offered excellent medical and dental coverage. There was always childcare within the building, and the company was cutting back on maternity leave. It was a win-win for Kingston.

Blair picked up her case and headed for the front door of the townhouse she shared with her cousin Laura and her fianc√© Dan.

She checked her watch as she reached the front door. Dan wouldn‚Äôt be home for a few hours. She planned to surprise him with a romantic dinner.

Laura was rarely home at night, always out partying. Her cousin was a model-not a supermodel, but still gorgeous. She knew how to make the most of it. Blair, on the other hand, wasn‚Äôt interested in clothes or makeup. She was more into books.

They had both moved to the city for different reasons. Laura to follow her modeling career and for Blair, it had been a chance to work for a great company like Kingston Industries. Under normally the great man himself Roman Kingston. The company had their fingers in so many pies, Blair was never bored. Even when Roman was being his most demanding. She loved her job.

Fishing for her keys. She juggled her briefcase, handbag, and suitcase. Once the key was in the lock, it turned easily. Blair pushed the door open. Stepping inside, she put her handbag and suitcase down at the bottom of the stairs. Before heading into the lounge room where she kept a desk. Sitting her briefcase on top.

Blair turned to make her way to the kitchen, pondering what to prepare for dinner. As she walked past the foot of the stairs, a sudden noise from upstairs caused her to halt in her tracks. Was there someone else in the house? Had she returned home to an intruder? Filled with panic, Blair took a step towards the front door, ready to flee.

However, at that moment, she realized something. Laura. Unlike Blair and Dan, Laura didn‚Äôt adhere to their typical working hours. She often slept late and stayed out until the early hours of the morning. It wasn‚Äôt the first time Blair had found her slumped on the front steps as she was leaving for work in the morning. Blair wasn‚Äôt sure if she should call out now. What if it wasn‚Äôt her cousin?

Her eyes scanned the room for something to defend herself with‚Ä¶ just in case. Her gaze landed on her late father‚Äôs baseball bat, which she always kept near the front door when she was home alone at night. It made her feel safer.

She grabbed the bat, weighting it in her hand for a moment. Before she set foot on the stairs, she paused, wondering if any of them creaked. She couldn‚Äôt remember. Taking a deep breath to steady her racing heart, Blair ascended the stairs slowly, step by step.

When she reached the landing, she stopped, straining to listen.

‚ÄúPlease be Laura. Please be Laura, and not some masked man waiting to jump out at me,‚Äù she muttered under her breath.

The hallway stretched ahead, with four doors. Three led to the bedrooms, and one opened to the shared bathroom. The only door ajar was the one to her and Dan‚Äôs bedroom. The others were shut. But to get to her bedroom, she‚Äôd have to pass the other doors.

That‚Äôs when she heard it, the unmistakable sound of a giggle from Laura, followed by a low, male groan. Relief flooded her chest. It wasn‚Äôt a burglar. Laura had brought someone home.

Just as Blair was about to turn away and leave, she heard the voice of the man Laura was with.

‚ÄúGod, yes,‚Äù the voice groaned.

Blair froze, her heart pounding. No. It couldn‚Äôt be.

‚ÄúLaura, you‚Äôre so fucking hot,‚Äù Dan‚Äôs voice came from their bedroom.

Her eyes widened. Dan. In their bed. With Laura. Blair‚Äôs stomach lurched.

This couldn‚Äôt be happening. She moved quietly down the hall until she stood outside her bedroom door, praying this was all some kind of terrible misunderstanding.

With a trembling hand, she pushed the door open.

The sight that greeted her was like a punch to the gut. She staggered backward, her mind unable to process what she was seeing.

There, in the middle of the bed, was Dan, flat on his back, with Laura straddling him, completely naked. She was moving up and down on him, her hands gripping his chest hair. From this angle, Blair could see Dan‚Äôs cock thrusting in and out of Laura. It felt like she was watching a scene from a porn film.

Dan‚Äôs hands gripped Laura‚Äôs waist and ass, guiding her movements.

‚ÄúErr, yes, fuck me harder,‚Äù Laura moaned.

Blair lifted a hand to her mouth to stop herself from crying out. No, no, no, no.

Dan‚Äôs grip tightened on Laura‚Äôs ass, spreading her cheeks wider.

Blair had never seen Laura naked before, not that it mattered when she was currently riding Blair‚Äôs fianc√©.

How could she do this? They had both watched Laura‚Äôs father, Peter, cheat repeatedly on Laura‚Äôs mother, creating a toxic home life. Blair had lived with them after losing her parents in a plane crash ten years ago. She had thought if anyone would understand the devastation of betrayal, it would be Laura.

This had to be a nightmare. Blair pinched herself, hard, as the sting registered immediately. Not a nightmare.

Dan had always hated Laura. He‚Äôd called her a slut. Mocked her outfits. Said she was shallow, incapable of real conversation.

Was it all a lie? Had he been jealous of the men in her life? Was that why?

One thing was certain, Dan‚Äôs mother, Paula, would never accept Laura as a suitable wife for her son.

But none of that mattered now. What was she supposed to do? How did someone handle this? It was like a scene from a B-grade movie.

She couldn‚Äôt pretend she hadn‚Äôt seen it. She didn‚Äôt want Dan anymore‚Ä¶ not now, not after this. Taking him back would be disgusting.

How long had this been going on?

They had been living together for five months. Dan had moved in with her and Laura to save money before the wedding. Had he been fucking Laura the whole time?

‚ÄúLaura, you are so goddamn tight,‚Äù Dan groaned, arching his back.

‚ÄúIs my pussy better than Blair‚Äôs?‚Äù Laura asked, riding him harder.

Blair‚Äôs heart stopped. Did she know Blair was standing here? Had she asked that on purpose?

Blair bit into her hand to keep from making a sound. She had given Dan her virginity. He had known what that meant to her. Knowing that he had done this.

She hadn‚Äôt even planned to be home today. She had wanted to surprise him.

The surprise had been on her.

She felt sick. A cold sweat broke over her skin.

Her other hand came up, gripping the doorframe for balance. Something solid pressed against her palm. The bat.

For a fleeting second, she thought about using it. Smashing the bed, the nightstand, the both of them. But she wasn‚Äôt that person. She rested the bat against the doorframe just in case she changed her mind and used it on them.

So instead, she straightened her spine. Let the rage steel her so when she finally spoke, her voice was calm. Icy, emotionless.

‚ÄúWhile you two finish up, should I cook dinner?‚Äù

# Chapter Two

‚ÄúFuck me.‚Äù Dan's head came up off the bed as he pushed Laura off his body. Blair could see the horror on his face when he saw her standing at the door. He‚Äôd been caught with his pants down, or off, as it was in this case. Laura scrambled across the bed, pulling a blanket over her naked body. Her face was filled with shock, showing her cousin hadn‚Äôt known of Blair‚Äôs presence. The expression she wore was incredibly real and impossible to fake.

‚ÄúNo thanks. Looks like Laura has taken care of that for you.‚Äù Blair was surprised how calm she sounded. When all she truly wanted to do was scream and shout and throw things. What would it accomplish? She would still have a broken relationship.

‚ÄúBlair! What are you doing home today?‚Äù Dan‚Äôs cock was wet and laying limp against his leg. Having his fiance walk in on him mustn‚Äôt be a turn on, it would seem.

Blair lifted an eyebrow at him. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you are worried about? Might be an idea to cover up.‚Äù

Blair was watching Dan with narrowed eyes. She had loved him, but the person she saw now was ugly to her. It didn‚Äôt matter anymore that he was very attractive. To her, he was ugly. No one should cheat on someone they claimed to love. Even if someone had held a gun to her head, she would have refused. It was a shame Dan hadn‚Äôt felt the same. As far as she could see, Laura hadn‚Äôt needed to force him. Hearing them talk during the act had told her that.

Blair put the bat down, resting it against the wall near the door. Just in case. She told herself that she wouldn‚Äôt use it, but who knew? Crimes of passion that had to have come from somewhere. Normal everyday people committing a crime in the heat of the moment. So it was safer if she put it down. Blair then crossed her arms across her chest. Looking back to see Dan had gotten off the bed and was pulling on his work pants.

She flicked her eyes to Laura. The bitch now had a smug look on her face. It had replaced the look of shock. Why?

Blood was roaring in her ears as she came to terms with the total destruction of her personal life. She never wanted to see him again, but she and Dan both worked for Kingston. She had applied first. Dan hadn‚Äôt joined the company until a year later.

Blair decided then and there she would not be leaving her job. It was her only concrete thing she could hang onto, then she was keeping it. It wasn‚Äôt like they work directly together.

Dan took a step towards her, reaching out his hand. ‚ÄúBaby..‚Äù

Blair took a step back. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare touch me?‚Äù Not only could she not stomach it, but who knows where that hand had been?

The venom in Blair's voice brought him up short. He turned to look at Laura before returning his eyes to her face. Blair knew she was pale. Who wouldn‚Äôt be?

‚ÄúYou have to believe me. This was a one time thing. It will never happen again. It meant nothing.‚Äù Dan pleaded with her.

Blair could see the look on Laura's face. Even before seeing it, she knew he was lying. Dan had a tell. When he lied, his right eyebrow would go up. Before today, the lies had never been a big deal, just little things. Had she noticed it when he had talked about Laura in the past? Blair wasn‚Äôt sure. Because sometimes the sub-conscious mind could even fool ourselves.

‚ÄúDo you know Dan? It doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Blair angled her chin up as her nails dug into her palm. ‚ÄúThis one time was all it took.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat.. No, Blair baby please, I love you.‚Äù Dan tried to take her in his arms.

Blair moved quickly, picked up the bat, and swung it so the end pressed up against his chest, pushing him back and holding him at bay. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even think about it.‚Äù

Dan looked down at the bat, raising his hands back at his shoulder level. ‚ÄúPlease, she seduced me. You know what a slut she is. I was missing you.‚Äù

They both heard the gasp from the bed. Before Laura responded. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs lying Blair. This has been going on for months. Soon after, he moved in.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up, you dumb bitch.‚Äù Dan turned to yell at her. Before saying to Blair. ‚ÄúShe is lying.‚Äù

Blair shrugged. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter. It only took the one time Dan.‚Äù She nudged him with the baseball bat. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call Laura a dumb bitch. I may never forgive her for this, but you were the one in a relationship, Dan, not her.‚Äù Blair could see Laura sliding out of the bed, scrambling around for her clothing, still holding the sheet to her breasts. ‚ÄúIf you think she is a slut, what the fuck does that make you?‚Äù Blair knew she would not feel clean even if she had ten showers. This was going to take time.

Blair knew she couldn‚Äôt deal with anymore right now. She needed to leave before they were both dressed. She needed to think, to process. Turning on her heel, she ran down the stairs. Quickly grabbing the suitcase, handbag. Blair only just remembered the briefcase as she was about to leave through the front door.

‚ÄúYou stupid slut, why did you have to say anything?‚Äù Dan‚Äôs angry voice came from upstairs

Blair rushed to her desk, picked up the briefcase and stood at the front door, ready to leave. Knowing once she walked through it, she wasn‚Äôt coming back. She had no idea where she was going, but anywhere was better than here.

Following Dan‚Äôs insult came Laura's high-pitched squeal. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a slut Dan.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou and your big mouth. You wanted this to happen, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù Dan accused.

Blair could hear the tears in Laura's voice. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt mind my mouth when it was sucking your cock.‚Äù

‚ÄúShh.‚Äù Dan was worried she was hearing their argument. ‚ÄúYou set me up, didn‚Äôt you? You knew she was coming home.‚Äù

‚ÄúDan I didn‚Äôt know.‚Äù Laura cried.

If she stayed any longer, both of them would have gotten dressed and then they would come down here, and she didn‚Äôt want another confrontation.

Taking a deep breath, Blair stepped through the front door, not looking back even as she heard Dan calling her name from inside the house.

# Chapter Three

Blair waved down a taxi. She shoved open the taxi door and climbed into the backseat as quickly as she could, intent on getting out of here as fast as possible. She felt like getting drunk. But if she went to a bar alone during the day, that would be inviting trouble. She could feel the tears as they slid unchecked down her face. She had held herself together while she had confronted Dan and Laura.

‚ÄúWhere to?‚Äù the driver asked, his voice cutting through the fog in her brain.

Where to? Good question.

Home wasn‚Äôt an option. Sutton and Keira were at work, and she didn‚Äôt want to sit in their empty apartment, replaying the image of Dan tangled in her cousin‚Äôs sheets. She needed a drink. But sitting alone in a bar in the middle of the afternoon? That felt like waving a white flag.

She hesitated, then rattled off the address of her office. At least there, she could pretend to be productive. Maybe even figure out what the hell to do next.

The taxi pulled away from the kerb and she exhaled, trying to steady herself.

The driver looked at her in the rearview mirror. ‚ÄúThere are tissues in the center compartment if you need them, hon.‚Äù

The driver‚Äôs voice was gentle, like he‚Äôd seen enough women cry in his backseat to know when to speak and when to keep quiet.

Blair grabbed a handful. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù She said before cleaning her face as best she could. It wasn‚Äôt like she wore a lot of makeup. So she might as well clean her face.

Her phone began to ring. Dan.

She still pulled it out of her to check. Her stomach clenched as she stared at the screen, his name glowing in bright white letters.

She could just imagine the first words he would say.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not what it looks like, Blair.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can explain.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, just let me talk to you.‚Äù

Lies. Excuses. The same bullshit men always spewed when they got caught.

She set the phone to silent and shoved it back into her bag.

By the time the taxi pulled up in front of the towering glass and steel structure of Kingston Industries, her makeup was beyond saving. She reached into her purse, dug out a crumpled twenty, and handed it to the driver.

‚ÄúBe honest,‚Äù she said, forcing a smile. ‚ÄúDo I look like a woman who just found out her fianc√© is screwing her cousin?‚Äù

The driver hesitated, giving her a careful once-over. ‚ÄúYour eyes are a little red, honey, but it‚Äôs hardly noticeable.‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúAre you going to be okay?‚Äù

The unexpected kindness nearly undid her.

She swallowed the lump in her throat and nodded. ‚ÄúYeah. Better to find out now, right? Just a little dump on the road of life.‚Äù She wasn‚Äôt sure who she was trying to convince the taxi driver or herself.

After paying the driver in cash, she climbed out of the taxi, hoisted her suitcase onto the curb and took a deep breath. Blair checked her phone screen to see Dan had called her six times and left six messages on her voicemail. Uninterested in what he had to say for himself, she slid the phone away in her handbag.

Blair turned toward the towering glass and steel structure of Kingston Industries. Roman had bought the building five years ago. The top eight floors belonged to Kingston, the lower three rented out to smaller businesses. With the way the company was expanding, she wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they took over the whole thing eventually.

She walked inside, adjusting her bag on her shoulder.

‚ÄúMiss Warner, Can I help you?‚Äù Blair blinked. Maggie, one of the receptionists, had stepped out from behind the lobby front desk, her gaze flicking over Blair.

Maggie stepped forward, taking the suitcase from her. In the same hand, she was still holding the bat. Blair had completely forgotten that she was even holding it in her hand.

Blair had walked into the office looking like she was about to commit a felony. She was relieved, though. It was something she wouldn‚Äôt need to retrieve later.

Blair exhaled, relieved. ‚ÄúThanks, Maggie. Can I leave everything here while I freshen up?‚Äù She was surprised her voice sounded so... normal.

‚ÄúOf course, Miss Warner.‚Äù Maggie‚Äôs eyes darted to the bat again.

‚ÄúBlair, please. How many times do I have to tell you?‚Äù Roman preferred first names, but some staff-especially the newer ones-struggled with that.

More with Roman than with her.

Maggie smiled, taking the suitcase, briefcase, and bat.

Blair headed across the foyer to the restroom.

Inside, she went straight to the mirrors. The cab driver hadn‚Äôt just been kind. She really didn‚Äôt look that bad. She pulled a makeup wipe from her bag and cleaned off the last remnants of mascara. A quick dusting of powder, some lip gloss, a little eyeliner.

She pinched her cheeks. People always said that added color, but she didn‚Äôt see a difference.

Her blue eyes were still a little red, but there wasn‚Äôt much she could do about that. She pulled out a brush, freed her long, wavy blonde hair from its bun, and redid it neatly. Good enough.

She left the restroom, retrieved her belongings from Maggie, and headed to the elevators. As she waited, she tried to recall Roman‚Äôs schedule. Did he have any meetings this afternoon?

Then it hit her. He shouldn‚Äôt have been home today. So no meetings were scheduled in his calendar.

She sighed. Her brain was fried. But walking in on your fianc√© shagging your cousin would do that to anyone.

The thought made her frown.

How often had they been doing this? Dan had been at home during a workday. She traveled occasionally for work, but not that often. If their affair had been going on for months, they had to have been meeting up on company time.

The elevator arrived. A woman she didn‚Äôt recognize stepped in with her.

Blair offered a polite, strained smile. When the woman got off at the second floor, Blair leaned back against the wall, staring at nothing.

Should she tell Roman about Dan? It would feel like sour grapes-tattling just because he cheated. But he was also ripping off the company. No way could he get home, have sex with Laura, and get back to the office during a lunch break.

The elevator dinged open. Blair inhaled deeply before stepping onto the executive floor.

Kara, the receptionist on the executive floor, looked up. ‚ÄúHey, Blair. I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be in today.‚Äù

Blair smiled. ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt planning to be, but I figured I‚Äôd get a jump on the meeting notes for Roman. Is he in?‚Äù

Kara shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, he left a little while ago. Called to have his calls held.‚Äù

Blair almost sagged in relief. She wouldn‚Äôt have to face him just yet.

‚ÄúThanks, Kara.‚Äù

She went to her office, shut the door, and sank into her chair.

Blair rested her head on the desk. Shit. She felt like a wrecking ball had just split her world in two.

How could he? But even worse than that, how could Laura?

The childish problems they had all had as kids, Blair had thought, they had grown out of that. Laura had always been a spoiled brat. Taking what wasn‚Äôt hers.

The problem was her parents, Blair‚Äôs aunt and uncle, doted on her and gave her everything she wanted. But when they had moved to the city two years ago, Laura hadn‚Äôt been that bad or by now Blair would have moved in with her sisters. She hadn‚Äôt when Sutton had come back from Europe because her sister Keira had just finished university. Keira had moved in with Sutton. She would have felt guilty leaving Laura on her own to move in with her sisters. What was the point, anyway? She and Dan had planned on getting a place of their own once they were married.

Lifting her head, Blair looked down at the ring on her finger. The engagement ring Dan had given her.

It wasn‚Äôt big. She hadn‚Äôt wanted big. She would make sure he got it back. He could sell it. Because she was sure Laura would want a big flashy ring. She had made fun of Blair‚Äôs ring.

Taking it off, Blair was about to throw it across the room. No, just in case it went missing. Opening the top drawer of her desk, Blair dropped it in, slamming it shut. She needed a drink. Standing, Blair went into Roman‚Äôs office, where she knew he kept a bottle of scotch. She wasn‚Äôt much of a spirit drinker, but anything would do.

Roman office was a statement of the man himself. Everything was big, strong, and masculine. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget intimidating.‚Äù Blair said to the empty room.

Going to his desk, she opened the bottom drawer and pulled out the bottle of scotch that Roman kept there. Taking it, she sat down on his Chestfield lounge near the window. She opened the bottle and took a drink. Almost coughing it back up. ‚ÄúHoly shit, this shit burns.‚Äù Blair knew it was an expensive bottle Roman only liked the best.

The problem was, it was straight. Why did he like this shit straight? This time, when she put the bottle to her mouth, Blair made sure to sip it this time. Nope, that didn‚Äôt help. But it wasn‚Äôt as bad as the first drink. So she had another. Laying her head back against the lounge. She had come here to think. What was her next move?

Lifting her hand so she could see the dial on her watch, Blair saw it was 3:15pm. She couldn‚Äôt call Sutton or Keira. Not yet. Let them get home from work. Blair planned to ask Sutton and Keira to assist her in organizing getting her stuff from the apartment. Although she didn‚Äôt want to put too much pressure on her older sister, Sutton. She was six months pregnant, and it hadn‚Äôt been an easy pregnancy.

Men. Why were they assholes? First, her boss for being so arrogant and intimidating and sometimes rude. Then Dan, who had been cheating on her with her cousin Laura for months. How low was that? Then there was Luca, the father of Sutton‚Äôs baby. Who had left her high and dry and pregnant?

Then she would see about crashing at their place until she could find somewhere. Their place wasn‚Äôt big enough for three adults and a baby. When it arrived. But it would be great to spend some time with her sisters. Eat ice cream and talk shit about men.

Although Sutton didn‚Äôt even talk about the man that had gotten her pregnant. It was a topic she refused to discuss. Even when their aunt Viv and uncle Peter had demanded answers. Blair lifted the bottle again to her mouth. Only she and Keira knew his first name.

The phone started ringing on Roman‚Äôs desk. Blair tried to ignore it, but as soon as it stop ringing it started again. Blair shifted to the edge of the lounge, rising to her feet. The room seemed to tilt ever so slightly, prompting a quick ‚ÄúOops.‚Äù to escape her lips.

After regaining her balance, she made her way over to the phone and lifted the receiver.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù she greeted into the handset. Not very professional, she thought.

‚ÄúRoman please.‚Äù Blair knew the voice. It was Claire Robertson. Roman‚Äôs little piece of fluff. It was the best way to describe Claire. She had this stupid girly voice that set Blair‚Äôs teeth on edge.

‚ÄúRoman isn‚Äôt here.‚Äù Blair put a hand on Roman‚Äôs desk to help stop the swaying of the room.

‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù Claire asked.

‚ÄúHow the hell should I know?‚Äù Blaire was surprised by her answer. Shit, where had that come from?

‚ÄúYou are his secretary.‚Äù Blair could hear the anger in the other woman‚Äôs voice.

‚ÄúYes, but I‚Äôm not his keeper and I sure as hell don‚Äôt own a crystal ball. Call or message his mobile.‚Äù Blair was over this conversation.

‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt answering his mobile hasn‚Äôt for days.‚Äù Claire whined.

Blair‚Äôs lips parted slightly. Oh.

That was Roman‚Äôs move. He didn‚Äôt argue, didn‚Äôt make dramatic exits. He just started to avoid before making a clean break. If Claire hadn‚Äôt heard from him in days, it was over. She just didn‚Äôt know it yet.

The little devil on her shoulder made her do it. But Blair couldn‚Äôt help the next words. ‚ÄúWell, one of two things has happened. Either you‚Äôre about to get dumped, or he‚Äôs dead. Either way, flowers will be involved.‚Äù

Blair sighed when she heard the shocked gasp from the other end of the phone, the scotch warming her veins, and loosening her tongue. ‚ÄúLook, Claire, let‚Äôs be honest. He‚Äôs not marriage material. Find someone new.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt wait for a reply, just hung up and dropped the receiver back into place.

She collapsed back onto the Chesterfield, lifting the bottle to her lips again.

Her own problems resurfaced to haunt her. How was she so blind? How did she not pick up on the signs? She wasn‚Äôt an idiot. Dan was a salesman. He had sold her the dream of happily ever after. She had just been blind to the cracks in their relationship.

Not only that, it looked like she had been missing something in her sex life. If what she had witnessed between Dan and Laura was any indication of how the act should be. She enjoyed it well enough, but it wasn‚Äôt something that made her cry out like Laura had been doing. Was that to stroke his ego? Should she have been doing that? The thing was, she didn‚Äôt know.

Dan had been her only lover. It had been his job to teach her.

Blair sighed, lifting the bottle again-only to pause when she noticed two tall, blurry figures standing in front of her.

Wait. No. Not two. Just one.

Blair squinted. ‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

She tried to sit up, bringing the bottle to her mouth, but before she could take another sip, it was plucked from her hand.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she protested. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs mine. If you want one, go find your own.‚Äù

She blinked, trying to focus.

The man standing in front of her-the one holding the bottle-came into view.

‚ÄúRoman?‚Äù

‚ÄúBlair,‚Äù he said, his voice unreadable. ‚ÄúWhat have you done to yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she said, slurring slightly, ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs... pretty obvious. As you can see, I‚Äôm getting shit-faced.‚Äù She reached for the bottle. ‚ÄúNow give it back so I can finish the job.‚Äù

Roman stepped away, placing the bottle on his desk. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôve had enough.‚Äù

Blair frowned. ‚ÄúYou know... sometimes you can be an asshole. No-most of the time.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do believe you‚Äôre going to regret this tomorrow.‚Äù

Then, to her surprise, he sat down beside her.

# Chapter Four

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not just an asshole, but a shithead too... always thought so,‚Äù Blair slurred, her tongue feeling too heavy in her mouth. She knew she shouldn‚Äôt be saying this, but she couldn‚Äôt stop herself.

Roman chuckled, leaning back. ‚ÄúI think I should get you some coffee.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äô want it.‚Äù Blair waved a hand dismissively, nearly hitting herself in the face. ‚ÄúI want... a man that ain‚Äôt a cheatin‚Äô rat.‚Äù Her eyes drifted over him, and despite her best efforts, she noticed-really noticed-how attractive he was. ‚ÄúDid you... did you ever cheat on your ex-wife?‚Äù

She‚Äôd met Jessica once. It hadn‚Äôt been a pleasant experience.

Roman‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt change, but his voice softened. ‚ÄúNot all men cheat, Blair.‚Äù

‚ÄúW-why‚Äôd she leave you then?‚Äù Her head tilted as if she were trying to piece together a puzzle.

‚ÄúThere are a lot of reasons marriages fall apart,‚Äù Roman said, dragging a hand down his face. ‚ÄúNot all of them have to do with cheating on the man‚Äôs part.‚Äù

It took Blair a moment to process that. Then her eyes widened. ‚ÄúShe cheated on you?‚Äù she whispered, as if it were some great secret. ‚ÄúWas she an idiot?‚Äù

Her boss was gorgeous-thick dark hair, intense gray eyes, chiseled cheekbones. And his body... well, from what she could see, it was fine. Not that she‚Äôd ever been interested before. She‚Äôd always been with Dan. Had been with Dan.

Roman reached over, gently lifting her chin with two fingers when her mouth fell open. ‚ÄúI worked a lot. Some would say I drove her to it.‚Äù

Blair blinked at him, then shook her head, making herself dizzy. ‚ÄúThass not an excuse... nope... no, no, no.‚Äù She dropped her head back onto the couch, exhaling loudly. ‚ÄúShould get a divorce before that... cheaters... all of ‚Äòem...‚Äù

Roman studied her with an amused expression. ‚ÄúYou know, this is the most I‚Äôve ever seen you relax around me.‚Äù

Blair lifted a hand lazily. ‚ÄúThass ‚Äòcause you‚Äôre... you‚Äôre normally soooo difficult to deal wit‚Äô‚Äù she muttered, barely able to get the words out.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt apologize for that.‚Äù His lips twitched. ‚ÄúI expect the best. That‚Äôs why this company is where it is today.‚Äù

Blair made a sound that was half a grunt, half a laugh. ‚ÄúSuppose so...‚Äù Her head felt heavy, her thoughts sluggish.

Roman let her sit in silence for a moment before asking, ‚ÄúWhat happened, Blair?‚Äù

She turned her head to look at him, her vision slightly unfocused. ‚ÄúI was an idiot.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy? Because you trusted the wrong person?‚Äù

Blair let out a shaky breath. ‚ÄúDan an‚Äô I grew up together, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt.‚Äù

She nodded. ‚ÄúI... I was always going home... back home, all the time, when I moved to th‚Äô city for this job. He... he got a job at Kingston‚Äôs, and I was happy ‚Äòbout it. Now I wish he wasn‚Äôt here.‚Äù Her voice wobbled, but she refused to cry. Not again. Not for Dan.

‚ÄúSo, the wedding‚Äôs off?‚Äù Roman gestured to her bare finger.

Blair lifted her hand, staring at it for a second before letting it flop back onto her lap. ‚ÄúYep. We didn‚Äôt even have a date set.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho was holding it up?‚Äù

She blinked at him. Why was he askin‚Äô so many questions? Why was he bein‚Äô so... nice? ‚ÄúMe. He wanted to get married last year. I wasn‚Äôt ready.‚Äù

Roman‚Äôs eyes narrowed slightly. ‚ÄúWhy? If you loved him, why did you want to wait?‚Äù

Blair shrugged, though it was a little sloppy. ‚ÄúIf what I saw t‚Äôday was anythin‚Äô to go by...‚Äù She trailed off, frowning. Maybe... maybe she‚Äôd always known somethin‚Äô was off. There was no passion. No fire. She‚Äôd loved Dan, but maybe not the way she was supposed to love the man she was gonna marry.

Right now, she wasn‚Äôt even sad. Just... angry.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù Roman pressed, his voice gentler now.

Blair‚Äôs face scrunched up as she remembered. ‚ÄúSaw him,‚Äù she slurred. ‚ÄúH-havin‚Äô sex with... ugh.‚Äù She waved a hand, unable to finish the sentence.

Roman‚Äôs jaw tensed. ‚ÄúI see.‚Äù

Blair stared at him for a long moment, her head swimming with thoughts she couldn‚Äôt quite hold on to. Then, suddenly, she reached out, grabbing his tie between her fingers.

Roman froze.

Blair stared at the fabric, tracing the pattern with unfocused eyes. She didn‚Äôt know why she did it. Maybe ‚Äòcause she needed to know. Needed to feel something different.

Without another thought, she pulled at the tie, closing the space between them, and pressed her lips to his.

For a moment, he didn‚Äôt move. But then‚Ä¶ Heat. Raw, consuming heat.

Blair gasped into his mouth, the shock of it searing through her. Her hands flew to his shoulders, gripping the fabric of his shirt, desperate to hold on to something solid.

This was different. So different.

Roman pulled back, breathing hard, his gray eyes dark with something unreadable. ‚ÄúBlair,‚Äù he murmured, voice rough. ‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt-‚Äú

She cut him off with another kiss, moving closer, pressing against him.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù she whispered, her voice trembling.

She needed to forget.

And she wanted‚Ä¶ to feel.

# Chapter Five

Her heart pounded in her chest. Just by his kiss was enough to tell her there had been something wrong with her relationship. Dan had been the problem all along. She didn‚Äôt even love Roman. Found him to be all too arrogant. But what she was feeling from just his kiss was more than she had felt with heavy petting when Dan touched her. Blair pulled back to stare at him.

Her boss raised an eyebrow. His expression... Blair was trying to put a word to it. ‚ÄúBlair, is everything alright?‚Äù His voice was calm, but there was a flicker of something else in his eyes‚Ä¶ something that made her stomach twist. Was it amusement? Hunger? She wasn‚Äôt sure, but she didn‚Äôt care. Not right now. Her mind was whirling with her own emotions. She could feel the heat between her legs and how wet she had become from one kiss.

Blair wasn‚Äôt sure if she should be ashamed. She had been with Dan and only Dan. Now she was getting all hot and heavy with her boss.

She leaned in closer. She still held his tie, her grip on it tightening. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ need to know,‚Äù she whispered, her voice trembling slightly. ‚ÄúIf‚Ä¶ if this is normal.‚Äù

His lips quirked into a half-smile, and he tilted his head, studying her with those piercing gray eyes. ‚ÄúNormal for what?‚Äù he asked softly, his tone almost teasing. He reached forward to run his fingers down her face. His eyes followed their movement.

Blair bit her lip, her mind racing. How could she explain this? She couldn‚Äôt just blurt out that she‚Äôd seen her fianc√© fucking someone else‚Ä¶ that she didn‚Äôt even feel jealous about it now or overly heartbroken. She was angry, mad and shocked that she hadn‚Äôt picked up on the affair. No, she couldn‚Äôt say it, but she didn‚Äôt want to come across‚Ä¶. What? Something that wouldn‚Äôt make her sound like a complete flake or shallow. She needed to see if something was wrong with her. She needed to feel wanted.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how to describe it,‚Äù she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúBut I need you to show me.‚Äù

The look in his eyes was so hot that she could feel the heat of them scorch her, and he reached up, gently prying her fingers off his tie. But instead of pulling away, he wrapped his fingers around hers, holding them tightly.

‚ÄúShow you what, Blair?‚Äù he asked, his voice low and smooth, like silk. It caused goosebumps to appear on her arms.

She swallowed hard, her breath catching in her throat. Every nerve in her body was on fire, her pulse racing as she stared into his eyes. ‚ÄúEverything,‚Äù she said finally, her voice firm despite the way her hands were shaking. ‚ÄúI need to know if I‚Äôm normal. If‚Ä¶ if I feel the way I should.‚Äù

He studied her for a long moment, his thumb brushing lightly over the back of her hand.

‚ÄúBlair, I‚Äôm not sure this would be a good idea. You have been drinking. Tomorrow you could regret this and with the amount you have drunk. It might seem like I took advantage of you.‚Äù

Blair wanted to know, and Roman was a skilled lover. She got up from the lounge and walked over to his desk, heart pounding in her chest, which echoed with the same throbbing of her core. Picking up his gold pen and the notepad on his desk. Quickly she wrote a statement before signing it, then went back to where he was, standing in front of him between his legs. She looked down at him as she handed him the notepad.

Silently, he took the pad from her, not taking his eyes from her face. Turning the notepad around. He watched her with an intent gaze before he dropped his eyes. He read aloud what she had scribbled down. ‚ÄúI, Blair Warner of sound mind, give permission for Roman Kingston to fuck me, Blair Warner, in any which way he so chooses. Signed Blair Warner. At least you know what day it is.‚Äù

Roman dropped the pad beside him on the lounge, then lifted his eyes to her face again. ‚ÄúIn any which way I choose, Blair. You could be playing a very dangerous game here.‚Äù Roman settled back on the lounge, putting his hands on his knees. She saw his fingers clench and turn white as if he was stopping himself from reaching for her. The sight of him and the deepening sound of his voice only increased her need. Sending shivers down her spine. Blair pressed her thighs together. She felt like moaning.

‚ÄúAre you sure about this, Blair?‚Äù he asked, his voice soft but serious. ‚ÄúOnce we start, there‚Äôs no going back.‚Äù

She hesitated for a moment, her mind reeling with doubts. What was she doing? This was insane. She was about to throw herself at her boss, a man who had always been professional, always kept his distance. And yet‚Ä¶ there was something he made her feel‚Ä¶ even in this madness.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure,‚Äù she said finally, her voice steady despite the tremor in her chest.

He nodded, his expression darkening before lifting a hand to touch her, ‚ÄúKneel in front of me,‚Äù Not giving her time to question him, he guided her onto the floor.

Before he leaned forward, putting his hands behind her head, and removed the pins and hair band from her hair. He ran his fingers through the long blonde length that reached her bottom. ‚ÄúFuck, I knew you had long hair, but this is a wet dream.‚Äù Blair never wore her hair out at work. He played with her hair for a moment longer as he spread it out over her shoulders. ‚ÄúTake your jacket off.‚Äù

Blair bit her lip. She only had on a camisole under the jacket that had a built in shelf, so she wasn‚Äôt wearing a bra.

‚ÄúBlair, however I choose, remember? Do it.‚Äù There was a growl in his voice that did things to her insides.

Blair undid the two buttons of her light jacket, pulling it off her shoulders and down her arms, then off. Letting it drop behind her, uncaring.

He sucked in his breath when he saw her nipples were hard and pressed against the thin fabric of the cami. Lifting a hand from his knee, he rubbed a finger over one beaded nipple. ‚ÄúPretty. Do you normally come to the office without a bra?‚Äù",1,1750917590.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1  
  
All of Manhattan knew about the PECULIAR TRADITION in the Forrester family, New York's wealthiest dynasty‚ÄîEvery new bride had to spend her wedding night alone in the family chapel, praying until dawn. Only those who emerged unharmed the next morning were considered blessed by the Forrester ancestors.  
  
What once had been just a formality turned into a nightmare when Callum Forrester, the current heir, took a bride.  
  
His bride was found dead in the chapel, her throat slashed with a gruesome wound, her limbs grotesquely twisted.  
  
Every security camera was reviewed, but the footage clearly showed no one had entered the chapel that night except the bride herself.  
  
Later, Callum married seven more times over the years, and horrifyingly, each bride met the same fate on her wedding night in that chapel.  
  
Police investigations yielded nothing conclusive, and each death was eventually ruled a suicide.  
  
Rumors spread throughout Manhattan‚Äîsome claimed the Forrester estate was haunted, others whispered about dark rituals. No family would risk sending their daughter there anymore.  
  
But today, I stood before Mrs. Forrester in a crimson dress, my posture graceful yet determined.  
  
""Mr. Forrester is exceptionally handsome,"" I said. ""I've admired him from afar for years. I'm willing to be his ninth wife.""  
  
I looked her directly in the eyes. ""Don't worry. Your ancestors may not have liked the others, but they'll certainly like me.""  
  
\---  
  
My family ran a small bakery on York Avenue.  
  
Before dawn each morning, my sister would help our parents with the work‚Äîkneading dough, preparing fillings, making pastries, brewing coffee. She excelled at everything and never let me help.  
  
""Melody, you're meant for academics,"" she would say. ""Just focus on your studies.""  
  
""We'll support you all the way to success!""  
  
Eight years ago, on the day I was announced as Manhattan's valedictorian.  
  
My sister, dressed in a pristine white gown, shyly boarded the luxurious wedding car sent by the Forrester family.  
  
Everyone envied her good fortune. While serving coffee one morning, she had somehow caught the eye of Callum Forrester, heir to the family fortune, and was now marrying into wealth and privilege.  
  
I was happy for her too, not because of the Forrester fortune, but because of the shy, joyful look on her face before she left:  
  
""Melody, don't worry about me. Callum is truly kind, and his family has been welcoming,"" she said, holding my hands. ""I need to fly higher so you can go further. You'll always be the sister I'll protect with everything I have!""  
  
That night, I dreamed my sister had a beautiful baby who called me ""Auntie"" in the sweetest voice while clutching my shirt.  
  
But the next morning, the shocking news of my sister's death shattered our world.  
  
I raced to the Forrester estate, arriving just as they carried her out on a crude stretcher.  
  
My sister's once delicate hands were now bruised and gray. Her fingertips were bloody, all ten nails forcibly torn off, the flesh raw and mangled.  
  
Despite everyone's attempts to stop me, I yanked back the sheet covering her.  
  
Her death was horrifying‚Äîa gaping wound across her throat, her body twisted unnaturally, her eyes bulging like a fish's.  
  
Her pristine white gown was soaked through with blood, a pool of it staining the stretcher beneath her.  
  
I felt the world spinning as I collapsed to the ground.  
  
But then I heard my father's sickeningly servile tone as he kowtowed to Callum.  
  
""This terrible incident must be Victoria's fault‚Äîshe simply wasn't worthy of the Forrester ancestors' blessing.""  
  
""Mr. Forrester, you're young and successful. You'll definitely find a much better wife in the future. Please don't waste your grief on someone so worthless!""  
  
Though we weren't wealthy, my father had always been kind to us sisters, never speaking harshly to either of us.  
  
When relatives once mocked him for having ""worthless daughters,"" he had grabbed a kitchen knife and confronted them.  
  
Now I couldn't believe these words were coming from his mouth.  
  
""Who would've thought I'd marry a mental case? Killing herself in the chapel on our wedding day‚Äîwhat terrible luck!""  
  
""Get rid of her quickly. The sight is giving me a headache.""  
  
Callum's face was dark with annoyance, showing no grief or pain as he turned to leave.  
  
My sister treasured life above all else and had promised to protect me forever‚Äîhow could she possibly have committed suicide?!  
  
Red-eyed, I moved to confront them, only to be struck hard across the face by my father.  
  
""It's your sister's fault for not being fortunate enough to marry into such a good family!""  
  
""Stop embarrassing yourself and come home with me now!""  
  
I saw stars from the impact as my father dragged me away amid the whispers and stares of onlookers.  
  
The incident caused an uproar throughout Manhattan, prompting a special investigation team from the state.  
  
Shockingly, the conclusion matched Callum's claim‚Äîmy sister had committed suicide.  
  
The Forrester estate had stringent security, and all surveillance footage was perfectly preserved. The recordings clearly showed that after my sister entered the chapel, no one else went in. The audio recordings captured even the sound of mosquitoes flying but recorded no screams.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Outside the chapel doors and windows, everything remained peaceful until the next morning when Callum and his mother opened the door and discovered my sister's body.  
  
The medical examiner carefully checked every suspicious detail and ruled out homicide.  
  
Everyone calmly accepted this conclusion‚Äîeveryone except me.  
  
After spending the summer break crying, I enrolled at Princeton University as planned.  
  
Not because I cared about my future, but because it had been my sister's greatest wish for me.  
  
I abandoned the popular finance major and instead chose the obscure field of criminal investigation.  
  
After completing my undergraduate studies, I continued with a combined master's and doctoral program. I studied harder than anyone, terrified of missing any knowledge that might help me solve the mystery of my sister's death.  
  
Eight years later, I returned to Manhattan again.  
  
Much had happened with the Forrester family during my absence. After my sister, Callum had married seven more wives.  
  
These seven women came from vastly different backgrounds, with varied appearances and personalities.  
  
Yet each bride had died by apparent suicide in the family chapel on her wedding night.  
  
Particularly noteworthy was the eighth wife, married just six months ago‚ÄîDarla Thompson, a butcher's daughter from the marketplace. She weighed nearly 300 pounds and was strong enough to knock out a grown man with one punch, with a notoriously volatile temper.  
  
Her father had gambling debts of $500,000, and the Forresters, desperate for a bride, had promised her $20 million in cash and ten commercial properties in Marina City if she survived the night.  
  
Darla tried‚Äîbut didn't make it out alive.  
  
Callum had attempted to persuade his family to abandon the chapel ritual, but Mrs. Forrester insisted it was a tradition passed down through generations that could not be broken.  
  
This led to rumors spreading throughout Manhattan‚Äîsome said the Forrester estate was haunted by malevolent spirits determined to end the family line; others whispered that the Forresters were sacrificing brides to feed otherworldly beings in exchange for their incredible wealth.  
  
Whatever the truth, no family across the country was willing to send their daughter there anymore.  
  
Yet on my second day back in Manhattan, I dressed in a striking crimson dress, applied flawless makeup, and appeared at the Forrester estate's entrance.  
  
""Tell your mistress I'm willing to be Callum Forrester's ninth wife.""  
  
News of my request to marry Callum spread through Manhattan like wildfire.  
  
Though Manhattan wasn't small, gossip traveled faster than any virus.  
  
""I heard Melody Vincent just returned yesterday and is already offering to marry Callum Forrester. Both sisters are just gold-diggers!""  
  
""Poor Mr. Vincent‚Äîhe used to brag about how brilliant his daughter was, but look at her now, falling at the feet of money just like her sister.""  
  
""Money aside, those Forrester rumors should give anyone pause. Looks like the Vincent family might lose both daughters to that cursed place!""  
  
Everyone in Manhattan branded me as a shallow gold-digger.  
  
The fact that I was a Princeton graduate with a doctorate made the contrast all the more shocking and thrilling to them.  
  
Inside the Forrester estate, Mrs. Forrester had me brought to her.  
  
""Melody Vincent, do you truly want to marry my son?"" she asked, studying me with interest.  
  
""More certain than gold is pure!"" I replied with a smile.  
  
""Everyone knows Mr. Forrester is refined, gentle, and friendly‚Äînot to mention his net worth recently surpassed ten billion. What reason could I possibly have not to like him?""  
  
Mrs. Forrester responded with a cold laugh.  
  
""I knew you couldn't genuinely care for Callum!""  
  
The disgust in her eyes was unmistakable.  
  
But I knew she had no choice.  
  
""Look, I'm not gonna beat around the bush,"" she said.  
  
""You haven't forgotten what happened to your sister in our family chapel eight years ago, have you?""  
  
""During the eight years you've been away, a new bride has died in that chapel each year. What makes you think you'll live longer than they did?""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Mrs. Forrester's piercing gaze fixed on me.  
  
I smiled faintly.  
  
""Don't worry, Mrs. Forrester. I'm different from those ordinary women. Your ancestors may not have liked them, but they'll certainly approve of me!""  
  
I stared back at her with proud confidence.  
  
She studied me for a long time before finally nodding in agreement.  
  
""Go prepare yourself. Only by surviving tonight can you prove you're different from the others!""  
  
She dismissed me with a wave.  
  
I smiled, knowing all truths would be revealed tonight!  
  
When I returned home, my parents were already waiting.  
  
""What madness is this? Who gave you permission to agree to marry Callum Forrester?!"" My father's face was flushed with anger.  
  
My mother anxiously wiped away tears, her eyes filled with sorrow as she looked at me.  
  
But as I faced my father, I felt nothing.  
  
""Since when have you cared who I marry?"" I asked, staring into his eyes.  
  
""What nonsense! Why wouldn't I care? Don't you know about the Forrester rumors? Going there is practically suicide! Are you trying to put me and your mother in an early grave?""  
  
My father desperately tried to make me see reason.  
  
But I only coldly asked: ""If you truly cared, you wouldn't have let Victoria die in vain back then.""  
  
My father's entire body trembled, his lips quivering.  
  
""Melody, don't speak to your father like that. Your father‚Ä¶"" my mother began.  
  
""Shut up!"" he snapped harshly when my mother tried to defend him.  
  
Then he glared at me intensely.  
  
""Fine, since you've made your decision, I won't interfere anymore.""  
  
""From this day forward, you are no longer my daughter!""  
  
My father drove me from the house despite my mother's desperate pleas, but he remained unmoved.  
  
After leaving, I bowed deeply toward my parents' home.  
  
""Dad, Mom, your daughter has been unfilial.""  
  
""If I can uncover the truth, I promise I'll return to care for you properly!""  
  
I whispered before turning toward the end of the alley.  
  
Callum's wedding procession was even more extravagant than eight years ago‚Äîa line of Rolls-Royces that anyone would envy.  
  
""Well, that's it for the Vincent family line!""  
  
""All those years of fancy education, and that Princeton doctorate isn't worth squat, is it?""  
  
The neighbors lining the alley had all come out to mock me with their cruel taunts.  
  
Yet I boarded the car without hesitation.  
  
The procession moved slowly, taking half an hour to reach the vicinity of the Forrester family chapel.  
  
But when we were still about five hundred yards from the chapel, the driver refused to go any further.  
  
""Miss Vincent, may God be with you. We wouldn't go near that place even if you killed us,"" the driver said, turning to me.  
  
I nodded slightly, then got out and looked ahead.  
  
Perhaps it was the poor weather, or perhaps the area truly was heavy with malevolent energy, but the summer night suddenly felt bone-chillingly cold.  
  
The dark alley ahead resembled a path to hell, yet I walked forward with determined steps.  
  
A few minutes later, I stood before the Forrester family chapel.  
  
The door creaked open, and Mrs. Forrester stood in the entrance beckoning to me.  
  
Perhaps it was her overly pale makeup, but I couldn't shake the impression she resembled a paper effigy.  
  
Mrs. Forrester thrust a prayer book into my hands.  
  
""Go. Recite the prayers,"" she instructed coldly.  
  
""Read them through once, then again. I advise you not to fall asleep‚Äîotherwise... well, who knows what might happen.""  
  
Her eyes held a strange mixture of contempt and pity as she looked at me.  
  
Beside her, Callum emerged from the chapel with several others.  
  
He glanced at me dismissively.  
  
""Your sister was much prettier than you, but it doesn't matter now. I'd marry a pig if it survived the night!""  
  
Callum's face was filled with arrogance.  
  
I silently clenched my fists.  
  
I remained convinced that Callum had done something to my sister!  
  
Now my enemy stood before me, yet I could do nothing‚Äîthe frustration was unbearable.  
  
""May I enter now?"" I asked, looking at Mrs. Forrester.  
  
She didn't speak, merely gesturing for someone to open the inner doors of the chapel.  
  
I walked step by step toward the unknown abyss, my heart growing heavier with each step.  
  
The door slowly closed behind me.  
  
As the last sliver of light disappeared, I found myself in complete darkness.  
  
Whoosh!  
  
Suddenly, candles on the walls ignited, their flickering light making everything around me seem eerily distorted.  
  
My heart raced involuntarily, especially when I first glimpsed the portraits of Forrester ancestors on the walls‚Äîmy fear reached its peak.  
  
Ahead, memorial tablets were arranged neatly, with a prayer mat placed on the floor.  
  
I took a deep breath, gathering my courage to approach, kneeling on the mat.  
  
Then I opened the prayer book, trying to calm myself.  
  
But just as I prepared to begin reciting, something suddenly occurred to me.  
  
""Let me out! Let me out right now!""  
  
""I know what's happening!""  
  
""I know why all those brides died mysteriously!""

1lksgqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1lksgqu/the_billionaire_backs_me_up_a_revenge_love_story/,The Billionaire Backs Me Up ‚Äì A Revenge Love Story You Can‚Äôt Miss,"Chapter 1 - A Vow Shattered, A Price Demanded



The pale morning light filtered through my curtains as I admired the wedding dress sketches scattered across my desk. Six years of loving Julian, and in three days, I'd finally be Mrs. Grayson. I traced my fingers over the intricate lace design I'd spent months perfecting‚Äîmy masterpiece as both a bride and a designer.



My phone shattered the peaceful moment, vibrating violently against the nightstand. Cherry, my assistant at Ashworth Bespoke, rarely called this early.



""Hazel, I'm so sorry to disturb you,"" she said, her voice tight with tension. ""Julian just came by the studio and took the wedding dress.""



I sat up straight, confusion clouding my mind. ""What? Why would he do that?""



""I don't know. He just said it was urgent and that you knew about it."" Cherry's voice quivered. ""I tried calling you first, but he insisted it was fine.""



A cold sensation crept up my spine. Julian knew the tradition‚Äîthe groom shouldn't see the dress before the wedding. ""It's okay, Cherry. I'll handle it.""



I immediately dialed Julian's number, my heart pounding against my ribs.



""Julian, where are you? Cherry said you took my wedding dress.""



The silence on the other end stretched painfully before he finally spoke. ""I'm at Memorial Hospital.""



""Hospital? Are you okay?"" Panic surged through me.



""I'm fine, but... Hazel, we need to talk.""



Something in his voice made my stomach twist. ""What's going on?""



""The wedding... it's canceled.""



The words hit me like a physical blow. I gripped the edge of my bed, suddenly dizzy. ""What are you talking about?""



""It's Ivy. She's been diagnosed with terminal cancer. Stage four. The doctors say she has three months at most.""



Ivy. My half-sister. The daughter of the woman who had destroyed my mother's life.



""What does that have to do with our wedding?"" I whispered, already dreading the answer.



""Her dying wish... she wants to marry me, Hazel."" His voice cracked. ""How can I deny a dying woman her last wish?""



The room seemed to spin around me. Six years together, countless blood donations to help Julian with his rare blood disease, and he was throwing it all away for Ivy?



""You're canceling our wedding to marry my stepsister?"" I could barely force the words out.



""Half-sister,"" he corrected gently. ""And yes. I'm sorry, Hazel. I never meant to hurt you.""



Memories flooded back‚ÄîIvy's mother, Eleanor, seducing my father while my mother was pregnant with me. My father abandoning us, my mother spiraling into depression until she took her own life. Ivy and Eleanor moving into our family home while I was relegated to the servants' quarters. My father using my mother's family business as a dowry to win Eleanor's hand.



""This isn't just about a wedding, Julian. You know what she and her mother did to my family.""



""People change, Hazel. She's dying."" His voice hardened. ""Look, I know this is difficult. I'm prepared to compensate you‚Äîfifty percent of Grayson Enterprises.""



""Compensate me?"" I choked out. ""Like I'm a business transaction?""



""Be reasonable. Think about what that stake could do for your fashion line.""



Something snapped inside me. The tears that had been threatening to fall dried up, replaced by a cold, clear fury.



""Where is my wedding dress now?"" I asked, my voice surprisingly steady.



""At Ivy's. She's having it altered.""



Of course she was. Ivy had spent our entire childhood taking everything that was mine‚Äîmy father's love, my inheritance, my home. Now she was taking my fianc√© and wearing my handcrafted wedding dress while doing it.



""I see."" I hung up without another word.



I sat motionless, staring at the wall. The dress I'd poured my heart into, the wedding I'd dreamed of since I was a little girl, the man I thought loved me‚Äîall snatched away in an instant.



My phone buzzed again. My best friend Victoria.



""Have you heard?"" she demanded without preamble.



""Just now.""



""That absolute piece of garbage! And Ivy‚Äîusing cancer as an excuse to steal your man? Classic her.""



""He offered me half his company as compensation,"" I said numbly.



""Half? That cheap bastard should give you the whole damn thing! After all you've done for him?""



Victoria's outrage ignited something in me. She was right. For six years, I'd been Julian's blood donor, literally keeping him alive with my rare Rh-negative blood type‚Äî""panda blood,"" as the doctors called it. I'd nursed him through his illness, built my career around our future together, and this was how he repaid me?



I thought of my mother, how she'd withered away after my father's betrayal. How Eleanor had paraded around in my mother's jewelry, slept in my mother's bed, while my mother faded into a shell of herself.



I would not become my mother.



""Hazel? Are you still there?"" Victoria's concerned voice pulled me back.



""I'm calling him back,"" I said decisively.



""Good! Tell him exactly where he can shove his fifty percent!""



After hanging up, I dialed Julian's number again. He answered on the first ring.



""Hazel, I'm glad you called. I know this is a lot to process‚Äî""



""Julian,"" I cut him off, my voice cool and steady. ""I've considered your offer.""



""You have?"" Hope tinged his voice. He'd expected me to fall apart, to beg and plead.



""Yes. It's unacceptable.""



""Hazel, please be reasonable‚Äî""



""Give me the entire company, and I'll give up the position of bride."" The words flowed with surprising ease. ""If you agree, come back tonight, and we'll sign the agreement.""



Silence stretched between us. I could almost see his shocked expression.



""The... entire company? Hazel, that's my family legacy.""



""And marrying me was supposed to be your future. You've made your choice. Now I'm making mine."" I paused. ""Tonight, Julian. Either come with ownership papers, or don't come at all.""



I ended the call before he could respond, surprising myself with my newfound steel. The devastated bride was gone. In her place stood a woman who refused to be discarded without extracting a proper price.



The ball was in his court now.

...

Chapter 2 - The Fianc√©'s Final Insult



I spent the day in a haze of anger, meticulously packing Julian's things into boxes. Six years of shared life reduced to cardboard containers lined up by the door. His favorite coffee mug. Those hideous plaid pajamas I'd always threatened to burn. The silver cufflinks I'd given him for our first anniversary.



With each item, I unearthed memories I was determined to bury. My hands worked mechanically while my mind kept replaying Julian's betrayal over and over.



""Your wedding dress looks better on Ivy anyway,"" I muttered sarcastically, tossing his prized golf trophy into a box with less care than it deserved. The satisfying crack it made as it hit his college diploma frame brought me a fleeting moment of joy.



Just before seven, the doorbell rang. I smoothed down my black dress‚Äîdeliberately chosen to look like I was attending a funeral‚Äîand opened the door.



Julian stood there looking haggard, but it was the woman behind him who caught my attention. Mrs. Landon, Julian's mother, her lips pursed in disapproval as she surveyed me.



""Hazel,"" Julian said, his expression a practiced mix of guilt and resolve. ""You remember my mother.""



""Mrs. Landon,"" I nodded coolly, stepping aside to let them in.



""I thought we'd moved past the formality, dear,"" she said with a thin smile. ""You used to call me Mom.""



""That was before your son decided to marry my sister instead of me,"" I replied sweetly. ""Please, come in. The boxes by the door are Julian's things.""



Julian winced. ""Hazel, I know this is difficult‚Äî""



""Is that the agreement?"" I cut him off, pointing to the folder in his hand.



He nodded, following me to the dining table. His mother trailed behind, her heels clicking disapprovingly on my hardwood floors.



""I can't believe you're doing this, Hazel,"" Mrs. Landon said as we sat down. ""After everything our family has done for you. Julian gave you your start in fashion, introduced you to all the right people‚Äî""



""Mother, please,"" Julian interrupted, but I was already leaning forward.



""What your family did for me?"" I asked, my voice dangerously soft. ""You mean besides Julian using my rare blood type to keep himself alive for the past six years? Or perhaps you're referring to how he's currently wearing the wedding tux I designed while planning to marry my sister?""



Mrs. Landon's face flushed. ""You're being unreasonable. Ivy is dying‚Äî""



""So you keep telling me."" I turned to Julian. ""The agreement?""



Julian slid the folder across the table. I opened it, scanning the documents that transferred ownership of A&G Bespoke entirely to me. Our jointly founded fashion company would now be mine alone. It felt hollow‚Äîa business victory that couldn't patch the hole in my heart.



""It's all there,"" Julian said. ""As you demanded.""



""Not quite everything,"" I said, placing the documents down. ""There's the matter of my wedding dress.""



Julian blinked. ""What about it?""



""I want one million for it.""



Mrs. Landon gasped. ""One million dollars? For a dress? Have you lost your mind?""



I kept my eyes fixed on Julian. ""That dress took me six months to design and create. Italian silk, French lace, hand-sewn crystals. It's an Ashworth original worth every penny.""



""This is extortion,"" Mrs. Landon hissed.



Julian held up his hand to silence his mother. ""It's fine. I'll transfer the money.""



""Julian!"" his mother protested.



""No, Mother. She's right."" He pulled out his phone, making the transfer with a few taps. My phone dinged with the notification, and I checked it before continuing.



""Now,"" I said, leaning back in my chair, ""I believe we're done here.""



Julian shifted uncomfortably. ""Actually, there's one more thing.""



Of course there was. I raised an eyebrow, waiting.



""Ivy... she was hoping you might let her have the wedding jewelry set as well. The one you had custom-made to match the dress.""



I stared at him in disbelief. The jewelry set‚Äîa diamond and sapphire necklace, earrings, and bracelet I'd designed myself. The sapphires matched my eyes exactly.



""She's dying, Hazel,"" Julian added quietly. ""It would mean the world to her.""



""What exactly does she want my jewelry for when she's going to be dead in three months?"" I asked coldly.



Mrs. Landon gasped again. ""How dare you speak about your sister that way!""



""Half-sister,"" I corrected, just as Julian had done to me on the phone. ""And she's made my life hell since we were children.""



Julian leaned forward, his eyes pleading. ""Hazel, I know things haven't been easy between you two, but people can change. Ivy has changed. The illness has made her reflect on her life.""



I almost laughed at his naivety. ""Has it? Or is she just continuing her lifelong hobby of taking what's mine?""



""Please,"" Julian whispered. ""I'll make it up to you. After... after Ivy passes, we could still have our future together. An even grander wedding, I promise.""



The silence that followed was deafening. I stared at him, unable to process what I'd just heard.



""You think,"" I finally said, each word sharp as glass, ""that after you marry my sister in my wedding dress, I'll just wait patiently for her to die so we can pick up where we left off?""



Julian had the decency to look ashamed, but he pressed on. ""I still love you, Hazel. This doesn't change that. It's just... it's the right thing to do for someone who's suffering.""



I felt something break inside me‚Äîthe last thread of affection I'd been clinging to. This wasn't just betrayal; it was delusion of the highest order.



""Julian,"" I said, my voice surprisingly steady, ""you are truly the most pathetic man I've ever known.""



""Now see here‚Äî"" Mrs. Landon began, but I silenced her with a look.



""Fine,"" I said, turning back to Julian. ""Another million for the jewelry set.""



""Two million dollars for jewelry and a dress?"" Mrs. Landon sputtered.



""Two million dollars is a small price to pay for stealing someone's fianc√© and wedding,"" I countered.



Julian nodded, making the second transfer without argument. My phone pinged again.



I signed the company transfer agreement, pushing it back across the table. ""You pay me the money, and tomorrow, I will personally deliver the full set of jewelry to the hospital, and visit my good sister while I'm at it.""



A flash of uncertainty crossed Julian's face. He knew my relationship with Ivy well enough to be concerned about what such a visit might entail.



""Hazel, maybe I should‚Äî""



""No,"" I cut him off firmly. ""You've made your choice, Julian. Now live with it."" I stood up, signaling the end of our meeting. ""Take your boxes on the way out. I won't be home tomorrow to let the movers in.""



Mrs. Landon looked like she wanted to say more, but Julian took her arm, guiding her toward the door.



""Thank you, Hazel,"" he said quietly. ""I know this isn't easy.""



I didn't respond, just watched as he awkwardly gathered the first load of boxes. At the door, he paused, looking back at me with those eyes I once thought were sincere.



""I really do love you,"" he said. ""I always will.""



I met his gaze steadily. ""Goodbye, Julian.""



After the door closed behind them, I sank onto the couch, staring at my phone. Two million dollars. A small fortune that did nothing to fill the void his betrayal had left.



Tomorrow, I would see Ivy. My half-sister who had spent her life trying to take everything from me. Who was now supposedly dying, yet still found the energy to steal my wedding, my fianc√©, and now my jewelry.



I picked up the small velvet box containing the sapphire set, opening it to see the stones gleaming in the lamplight. They were exquisite‚Äîand perfect for what I had planned.



I smiled for the first time that day. If Ivy wanted my jewelry so badly, I would be delighted to give it to her personally. And unlike Julian's ridiculous fantasy, I had no intention of waiting around for her to die before reclaiming my life.



Tomorrow, the real reckoning would begin.

...

Chapter 3 - A Wedding Stolen, A Fury Unleashed



The satisfying slam of the door behind Julian and his mother wasn't nearly enough. The moment they stepped outside, I sank to the floor, my body trembling with rage. Six years. Six years I had given Julian Grayson, and this was how he repaid me.



My dog, Bentley, a gentle golden retriever who usually avoided conflict, sensed my distress and padded over. His warm body pressed against mine, offering silent comfort.



""You're the only male I can trust,"" I whispered, burying my face in his soft fur.



The doorbell rang again. I jerked my head up, fury rekindled.



""What now?"" I hissed.



Through the peephole, I saw Julian standing there alone, shifting nervously from one foot to another.



""Hazel?"" he called through the door. ""I forgot my watch collection.""



I glanced at the expensive box sitting on the side table‚Äîthe one containing the luxury watches I'd gifted him over the years. Something dark and vengeful rose inside me.



""Oh, you want your watches?"" I shouted back.



I grabbed the box, yanked the door open, and thrust it into his startled hands. Then I reached for the papers we'd just signed.



""And here's our agreement,"" I snarled, flinging the papers in his face. ""Take it all and get out of my life!""



""Hazel, please‚Äî""



""Bentley,"" I commanded, pointing at Julian. ""Sic him!""



My usually docile retriever, picking up on my rage, started barking furiously. Julian stumbled backward in alarm as Bentley lunged forward, stopping just at the threshold.



""You're crazy!"" Julian gasped, retreating down the steps.



""I'm crazy? You're marrying my dying sister in my wedding dress!"" I screamed after him. ""Get off my property before I let him loose for real!""



I slammed the door again, hearing Julian's hasty retreat. The adrenaline coursing through me was both exhilarating and exhausting.



""Good boy,"" I whispered to Bentley, who immediately returned to his gentle self, licking my hand as if in apology for his brief ferocity.



Sleep eluded me that night. By morning, I was operating on pure vindictive energy. The two million dollars sat in my account like blood money. I dressed carefully in a crimson blouse and black skirt‚Äîwar colors. My makeup was flawless, armor against the day ahead.



My phone rang as I was gathering my purse. My father's name flashed on the screen. I contemplated ignoring it but decided to face him head-on.



""Hello, Father.""



""What the hell do you think you're doing?"" Harrison Ashworth's voice boomed through the speaker. ""Julian called me. You set your dog on him?""



I laughed coldly. ""Bentley didn't touch your precious almost-son-in-law. Unlike Julian, he knows the meaning of loyalty.""



""You listen to me, girl,"" my father growled. ""Ivy is dying. The least you can do is show some compassion.""



""Compassion?"" The word tasted bitter. ""Where was Ivy's compassion when she stole my fianc√©? Where was your compassion when you let your new wife drive my mother to depression?""



""Don't you dare bring your mother into this! Eleanor has been nothing but good to you‚Äî""



""Good to me?"" I interrupted incredulously. ""She's been trying to push me out of your life since day one! And now her daughter is marrying my fianc√©, and you're defending them?""



""Ivy deserves some happiness in her final months,"" he insisted. ""And Julian's doing the honorable thing.""



""The honorable thing would have been for him to stay faithful to me,"" I snapped. ""But don't worry, Father. I'm coming to the hospital today to give Ivy my blessing‚Äîand my wedding jewelry.""



""You are?"" His suspicion was palpable.



""Four o'clock. Don't be late."" I hung up before he could respond.



At the hospital, I marched through the sterile hallways with purpose, the velvet jewelry box in one hand and another, larger bag in the other. I paused outside Ivy's private room, hearing voices within.



""She's always been jealous of you,"" Eleanor's unmistakable voice drifted through the partially open door. ""Even as a child, she resented that you were prettier, more talented.""



I bit back a laugh. The delusion was astonishing.



""She's probably celebrating that I'm dying,"" Ivy's weak voice replied. ""She never wanted a sister.""



""That's not true, darling. But she's always been difficult, just like her mother. Harrison should never have married that woman.""



My blood boiled at the mention of my mother. I'd heard enough. I pushed the door open with more force than necessary, making Eleanor jump.



""Hazel!"" she exclaimed, her hand fluttering to her throat. ""We didn't hear you come in.""



""Clearly,"" I said dryly. ""Please, don't stop on my account. You were saying something about my mother?""



Eleanor at least had the decency to flush. Ivy lay in the hospital bed, looking pale and thin, but her eyes still held that calculating light I knew too well.



""I brought you something,"" I said, approaching the bed. I placed the velvet box on her lap. ""Your fianc√© paid quite handsomely for this.""



Ivy opened the box, her eyes widening at the sapphire and diamond set. ""They're beautiful,"" she murmured, lifting the necklace.



""Yes, they are,"" I agreed. ""Custom-designed to match my eyes‚Äînot yours. But I suppose that's fitting. Julian never could see clearly.""



The door opened again, and my father entered, followed closely by Julian. Their expressions shifted from surprise to wariness when they saw me standing by Ivy's bed.



""Hazel,"" my father acknowledged stiffly. ""I didn't expect you so soon.""



""I had another gift to deliver,"" I explained, holding up the second bag. ""A traditional Chinese custom to drive away bad luck.""



Before anyone could react, I pulled out a string of firecrackers from my bag and lit them with a small lighter. The rapid popping filled the room as I tossed them onto the floor.



""What are you doing?"" Eleanor shrieked, jumping back.



The smoke detectors wailed in response, and seconds later, the sprinklers activated, drenching everyone in the room. Ivy screamed as water soaked her hospital gown and bedding. Julian lunged forward to shield her, getting equally drenched.



""Hazel, have you lost your mind?"" my father roared, his expensive suit now ruined.



I stood calmly in the downpour, water streaming down my face. ""Just bringing good fortune to the happy couple,"" I said sweetly.



Nurses and security rushed in, evacuating patients from nearby rooms. In the chaos, I was escorted out, but not before catching Ivy's look of pure hatred. It warmed my heart more than any firecracker could.



Two hours later, after Ivy had been moved to a new room and everyone had changed into dry clothes, I returned. This time, hospital security eyed me suspiciously.



""I'm just here to talk,"" I assured them, hands raised in mock surrender.



Inside the new room, the atmosphere was frigid. My father stood protectively by Ivy's bed, while Julian sat in a chair, head in his hands. Eleanor glared at me from across the room.



""You're lucky they didn't arrest you,"" my father hissed.



""It was an accident,"" I replied innocently. ""Chinese weddings traditionally include firecrackers. I was just honoring the cultural significance of marriage.""



""This isn't funny, Hazel,"" Julian finally spoke, looking up with bloodshot eyes. ""Ivy could have gotten seriously ill from that stunt.""



""Oh? I thought she was already seriously ill,"" I countered.



Ivy reached for Julian's hand. ""It's okay,"" she said weakly. ""She's just upset. I understand.""



""Don't pretend to understand anything about me,"" I said, my voice dangerously low. ""Let's get one thing straight‚ÄîI know exactly what you're doing, Ivy. You've been trying to take everything from me since we were children.""



""That's not true!"" she protested, tears welling in her eyes. ""I've always looked up to you!""



""Is that why you're marrying my fianc√©?"" I asked coldly.



""It just happened,"" Julian interjected. ""We didn't plan it‚Äî""



""Oh please,"" I scoffed. ""Nothing just happens with Ivy. Every move is calculated.""



""She's dying, Hazel!"" My father's voice cracked. ""Can't you find some compassion?""



""Like the compassion you showed my mother?"" I fired back. ""Or the compassion Ivy showed when she cut up my prom dress? Or when she spread rumors that I slept with my design professor to get good grades?""



Ivy had the audacity to look shocked. ""That was years ago! I've changed!""



""Have you?"" I pulled out my phone, showing them the screen. ""Then explain this Instagram post from last week, where you're posing in my wedding venue‚Äîwith my wedding planner!""



Julian paled. ""What?""



""Oh, didn't she tell you? Ivy's been planning this for months. The cancer diagnosis just gave her the perfect excuse.""



""Is this true?"" Julian asked Ivy, whose face had taken on a calculating look.



""Of course not,"" she said quickly. ""I was just... exploring options. I never thought‚Äî""



""She didn't just steal my fianc√©,"" I interrupted, addressing the room. ""She's taking my entire wedding. Same venue, same date, same dress design‚Äîeven the same damn cake flavor!""



A heavy silence fell over the room. Julian looked confused, my father uncomfortable, and Eleanor defiant. Ivy's mask slipped for just a moment, revealing a glint of triumph in her eyes.



""Well,"" she finally said, her voice soft but unmistakably smug, ""it seemed a shame to waste all your hard work. And since we're family, I thought you wouldn't mind sharing.""



Julian squeezed her hand, nodding. ""That's right. We're keeping it in the family, Hazel. Your efforts won't go to waste.""



I stared at him, incredulous at his blindness. My fingers curled into fists at my sides as I fought to maintain my composure.



""What's it like?"" I asked, my voice dripping with contempt. ""Keeping the benefits within the family?""

...

Chapter 4 - A Slap, A Call, and the Unthinkable Proposition



The room fell silent at my question. I could see the gears turning in Julian's head as he processed my words, trying to determine if I was really suggesting what he thought I was.



""Hazel,"" Julian finally said, his voice strained. ""You're upset. I understand‚Äî""



""Do you?"" I interrupted, taking a step closer. ""Do you understand that for six years, I gave you my blood? That I watched you suffer through your illness, held your hand through treatments, and postponed my own dreams to support yours?""



Julian's face paled. He couldn't meet my eyes.



My stepmother Eleanor stepped between us, her perfectly manicured finger pointing at my face. ""That's enough! You've caused enough trouble today. How dare you come in here with those... firecrackers and soak my daughter? She's fighting for her life!""



""And I was fighting for mine for six years,"" I countered. ""But none of you seemed to care about that.""



The door opened, and my father stormed in, his face flushed with anger. He must have stepped out earlier and just returned, drawn by the commotion.



""What's going on here?"" he demanded, taking in the tense scene.



Eleanor immediately turned to him, her expression morphing into one of distress. ""Harrison, Hazel is upsetting Ivy again. After everything she's already done today!""



My father's eyes hardened as he looked at me. ""I warned you to behave yourself.""



""Or what?"" I challenged, feeling reckless in my anger. ""You'll disown me? Cut me out of your will? Been there, done that.""



His jaw clenched. ""You ungrateful‚Äî""



He raised his hand, and I braced myself for the slap that had been years coming.



But the blow never landed. Julian had moved between us, catching my father's wrist mid-air.



""Harrison, don't,"" Julian said firmly. ""This isn't helping anyone.""



My father yanked his arm free, pointing at me. ""Get her out of here. Now.""



Julian turned to me, his expression pleading. ""Hazel, can we talk privately?""



""There's nothing to talk about,"" I said coldly.



He grabbed my arm as I turned to leave. ""Please, just five minutes.""



I looked down at his hand on my arm, then back up at his face. With deliberate slowness, I raised my own hand and slapped him hard across the cheek. The sound echoed through the hospital room.



""Don't ever touch me again,"" I hissed, then walked out, head held high.



I was shaking by the time I reached the parking lot, adrenaline coursing through my veins. I fumbled with my keys, dropping them twice before managing to unlock my car. Once inside, I gripped the steering wheel until my knuckles turned white, fighting back tears that threatened to spill.



My phone rang. Victoria's face flashed on the screen. I took a deep breath and answered.



""Hey.""



""Where are you?"" Victoria demanded. ""I've been trying to reach you all day!""



""At the hospital,"" I replied, my voice steadier than I felt. ""Or just leaving it.""



""Hospital? Are you okay?""



""I'm fine. I just paid Ivy a little visit.""



There was a beat of silence. ""Tell me you didn't murder her.""



Despite everything, I laughed. ""No, but I did set off firecrackers in her hospital room.""



""You WHAT?""



I filled Victoria in on everything as I drove to her family's restaurant, The Imperial Garden. By the time I pulled into the parking lot, she was both horrified and impressed.



""You're insane,"" she said when I finished. ""Completely insane. I love it.""



Victoria was waiting at our usual corner booth, two glasses of wine already poured. She stood when she saw me, pulling me into a fierce hug.



""You look terrible,"" she said bluntly, examining my face.



""Thanks. That's just what I needed to hear.""



""You know what I mean."" She pushed a glass toward me. ""Drink.""



I obeyed, taking a long sip of the rich red wine. ""Julian wants to talk,"" I said, setting the glass down.



""Of course he does."" Victoria rolled her eyes. ""What's there to talk about? He's marrying your sister in your wedding.""



""Stepsister,"" I corrected automatically.



""Whatever. Blood relations don't seem to matter much to him anyway."" Her eyes narrowed. ""What else aren't you telling me?""



I sighed, knowing I couldn't hide anything from her. ""They're getting married in three weeks. At my venue. In my dress design.""



Victoria's mouth fell open. ""You're kidding.""



""I wish I was."" I took another sip of wine. ""Ivy's been planning this for months. The cancer just gave her the perfect excuse.""



""That manipulative bitch."" Victoria's hand tightened around her glass. ""And Julian? He's just going along with it?""



""He's convinced himself it's the noble thing to do."" I laughed bitterly. ""Giving a dying woman her last wish.""



Victoria pulled out her phone.



""What are you doing?""



""Calling that spineless excuse for a man."" Before I could stop her, she had Julian on speaker.



""Victoria?"" Julian sounded wary.



""You pathetic bastard,"" she greeted him cheerfully. ""I just heard what you did to Hazel.""



""It's complicated‚Äî""



""No, it's really not. You're leaving a woman who gave you her blood for six years to marry her dying stepsister. That's not complicated; that's despicable.""



""You don't understand‚Äî""



""What don't I understand? That you're weak? That you couldn't stand up to a manipulative woman and her equally manipulative mother? That you threw away six years for what... guilt? Pity?""



There was silence on the other end.



""Nothing to say?"" Victoria continued. ""Good. Listen carefully. If I ever see you near Hazel again without her explicit permission, I will personally make sure every high-end restaurant in this city knows exactly what kind of man you are. You'll be eating fast food for the rest of your miserable life.""



She hung up before he could respond.



I stared at her, equal parts mortified and grateful. ""You didn't have to do that.""



""Yes, I did."" She refilled our glasses. ""Now, what's the plan?""



""Plan?""



""For revenge, obviously.""



I sighed, suddenly feeling tired. ""I don't know if I want revenge anymore. I just want to move on.""



""Bullshit,"" Victoria said flatly. ""I saw what you did with those firecrackers. You want revenge. You're just afraid to admit it.""



Before I could respond, my phone rang. Julian. I showed Victoria the screen.



""Speak of the devil,"" she muttered.



After a moment's hesitation, I answered, putting it on speaker. ""What do you want?""



""We need to talk about the company transfer,"" Julian said, his voice all business. ""And finalize our divorce.""



My heart twisted at the word ""divorce,"" even though we'd only been engaged, not married. But after six years together, it felt like a marriage in all but name.



""Fine,"" I said coldly. ""When?""



""Tomorrow morning. My office. Nine o'clock.""



""I'll be there."" I hung up without waiting for his response.



Victoria raised an eyebrow. ""What company transfer?""



""He's giving me MG Designs as compensation,"" I explained. ""It's a failing fashion house, but the brand still has some recognition. With work, I could turn it around.""



""And you're accepting this? Like some kind of payoff?""



I shrugged. ""It's better than nothing. And it gives me a head start on my own business.""



Victoria didn't look convinced, but she didn't argue further.



The next morning, I dressed carefully in a tailored black suit that I'd designed myself. Professional, elegant, and utterly impenetrable. Julian wouldn't see an ounce of vulnerability from me today.



His office was exactly as I remembered it‚Äîsleek, modern, and soulless. Julian was waiting with his lawyer, documents spread across the conference table.



""Hazel,"" he greeted me, rising to his feet. ""Thank you for coming.""



I nodded curtly, taking a seat across from him. ""Let's make this quick.""



For the next hour, we went through the paperwork for the transfer of MG Designs. Despite everything, Julian was fair with the terms, ensuring I had complete control of the company and its assets.



""Now for the divorce,"" I said when we finished, pushing the signed papers aside.



Julian glanced at his lawyer, who cleared his throat. ""Actually, since you're not legally married, it's simply a matter of terminating the engagement. However, given the circumstances, Mr. Grayson thought it prudent to formalize the separation.""



""Let's go to the Civil Affairs Bureau now,"" I suggested, wanting this chapter of my life closed as quickly as possible.



Julian nodded, dismissing his lawyer. ""I'll drive.""



The ride to the bureau was silent and tense. I stared out the window, deliberately keeping my body turned away from him.



At the bureau, we took numbers and waited. When our turn came, we approached the desk together.



""We'd like to file for divorce,"" Julian explained to the clerk.



The woman looked up from her computer. ""Do you have an appointment?""



""No,"" I replied. ""We thought we could do it today.""



She shook her head. ""I'm sorry, but you need to schedule an appointment first. And there's a mandatory 30-day cooling-off period after filing.""



""Thirty days?"" I repeated, my stomach sinking.



""Yes, that's the law,"" she confirmed. ""The earliest appointment I have is next Wednesday. After that, you'll need to wait thirty days before the divorce can be finalized.""



I did the mental math quickly. That would mean we'd still be legally married when Julian and Ivy had their wedding.



""Is there any way to expedite the process?"" Julian asked.



The clerk looked sympathetic but firm. ""No, I'm afraid not.""



We scheduled the appointment and left, the silence between us even heavier than before.



""This is a problem,"" I finally said as we reached his car.



Julian hesitated, then looked at me with an expression I couldn't quite read.



""Maybe it's not,"" he said carefully.



""What do you mean?""



He took a deep breath. ""Maybe we don't need to get divorced at all.""



I stared at him, sure I had misheard. ""Excuse me?""



""Ivy's prognosis isn't good, Hazel. Six months, maybe less."" His voice was soft, almost tender. ""After she's gone... maybe you and I could try again.""



My mouth fell open as the full implication of his words hit me. He was suggesting we remain married while he married my stepsister, waiting for her to die so we could reunite. The sheer audacity of it left me speechless.



""Are you actually serious right now?"" I finally managed, my voice barely above a whisper.



Julian reached for my hand, his eyes earnest. ""I still love you, Hazel. What I'm doing for Ivy... it's just to give her some happiness in her final days. But you're the one I want to spend my life with.""

...

Chapter 5 - An Unthinkable Request and a Bitter Accusation



""Are you actually serious right now?"" I stared at Julian, unable to believe what I was hearing. The audacity of this man to suggest we stay married while he married my stepsister, then reunite after her death.



His eyes were pleading, hand still reaching for mine. ""Hazel, please understand‚Äî""



I slapped his hand away. ""Don't touch me. Don't you dare touch me.""



""I'm just trying to make this right!"" Julian's voice cracked with desperation.



""Make it right?"" I let out a bitter laugh. ""You want to marry my dying stepsister in my wedding, using my designs, while staying married to me, then come back when she's dead? And you think that makes anything right?""



His face flushed. ""When you put it that way‚Äî""



""There's no other way to put it!"" I was shouting now, not caring who heard. ""You're disgusting. Both of you.""



""Ivy is dying!"" Julian raised his voice to match mine. ""Don't you have any compassion?""



That was the final straw. I slapped him across the face, harder than I had at the hospital. The sound echoed in the parking lot.



""Don't you dare lecture me about compassion,"" I seethed. ""I gave you my blood for six years. I postponed my dreams for you. I nursed you through your illness. Where was your compassion when you canceled our wedding? Where was your compassion when you let Ivy steal everything I worked for?""



Julian rubbed his reddening cheek, eyes downcast. ""I didn't think‚Äî""



""That's right. You didn't think. You never do."" I turned away from him. ""This conversation is over. I'm filing for divorce next week, with or without you. And don't ever contact me again except through lawyers.""



I walked away, my heels clicking on the pavement. For once, Julian didn't follow.



Once in my car, I took a deep breath. I needed to call Grandma Helen and Aunt Rebecca to explain what happened. They had been so excited about the wedding.



""Hello, sweetheart!"" Grandma's cheerful voice answered after two rings. ""How are the final wedding preparations going?""



My throat tightened. ""Grandma... there's not going to be a wedding.""



Silence fell on the other end. ""What happened?"" Her voice was suddenly much sharper.



I told her everything‚ÄîJulian's betrayal, Ivy's manipulation, even the firecrackers. By the end, I could hear Aunt Rebecca in the background, swearing colorfully.



""That absolute weasel!"" Aunt Rebecca was now on speakerphone. ""I'll fly back right now. Let me at him.""



Despite everything, I smiled. My mother's family had always been fiercely protective.



""No need,"" I assured her. ""I've handled it. The wedding's off, and I'm moving forward.""



""What about your design business?"" Grandma asked practically. ""Wasn't it tied up with his company?""



""He's signing over MG Designs to me. It's not doing well, but I can turn it around.""



""Of course you can,"" Grandma said firmly. ""You're Catherine's daughter.""



My eyes welled with tears at the mention of my mother. ""I miss her.""



""She would be so proud of you,"" Aunt Rebecca said softly. ""Standing up for yourself like this.""



After promising to keep them updated, I hung up and drove straight to my new office. Ashworth Bespoke‚Äîformerly MG Designs‚Äîwas now mine. The paperwork had been rushed through, probably Julian's guilty conscience at work.



The staff seemed uncertain as I walked through the doors. News traveled fast, and they surely knew about the canceled wedding.



""Good morning, everyone,"" I announced, standing in the center of the main workspace. ""As you may have heard, I am now the sole owner of this company, which will now be called Ashworth Bespoke. I look forward to working with all of you.""



A few hours later, my assistant knocked on my office door. ""Ms. Ashworth? Mr. Grayson is here to collect his personal items.""



I nodded stiffly. ""Let him in. I'll step out.""



Julian entered as I gathered my things to leave. Our eyes met briefly, but I looked away first, refusing to engage. I walked past him without a word, chin high, back straight. He didn't try to speak either.



I was reviewing fabric samples in the conference room when my assistant appeared again, looking uncomfortable.



""Ms. Ashworth? There's a Ms. Ivy Ashworth here to see you.""



My stomach dropped. What could Ivy possibly want now?



""Send her in,"" I said after a moment's hesitation.



Ivy shuffled in, looking frail. Her once-glossy hair hung limp around her pale face, and she leaned heavily on a cane. The sight should have invoked sympathy, but all I felt was suspicion.



""What do you want, Ivy?"" I asked coldly.



She lowered herself carefully into a chair across from me. ""Thank you for seeing me, Hazel.""



""Cut to the chase. I have work to do.""



Ivy looked down at her hands. ""I have a favor to ask.""



I laughed harshly. ""A favor? You steal my fianc√© and my wedding, and you have the nerve to ask for a favor?""



""Please, just hear me out."" Her voice was soft, fragile. Always the perfect victim. ""Julian and I are getting married next week.""",1,1750917329.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

I didn‚Äôt know Vegas could dream. Not in the way people do, those restless, scattered dreams with flashes of old regrets and future longings, but in the way machines might. Deep grooves etched into a forgotten mainframe. Locked loops that replay tragedy as ritual. Code that doesn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs code, singing silently beneath layers of neon and blood. Something had stirred the city‚Äôs oldest dreaming, and I was caught in the ripple again.

The Ten of Swords still stayed with me. And I don‚Äôt mean metaphorically. The card won't leave. Some nights I wake up choking on it, tasting its damp paper edges against my tongue, like a tooth I didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd lost. Other times, it's there behind my eyelids when I blink, tattooed in negative light, folded like a pyramid, always damp with something that is not quite water. I burned a city‚Äôs worth of memory to stop Reno Mallory, and the deck didn‚Äôt forget. The deck just paused. Now it was dealing again.

The new call came from Prophet Rex, an Elvis impersonator who lives in a scorched trailer behind the Neon Museum. He's not a prophet in the biblical sense. But in Vegas, prophecy is a game of pattern recognition and confident delivery, and Rex is a master. He told me he‚Äôd heard the city murmur. He said something had slipped loose. Something vital. Someone had reshuffled the Lovers.

Not just any Lovers card. The Lovers. Number Six of the Major Arcana. The soul-card of linked destinies and crossroads, of union and parting, of blood-oaths sworn beneath false moons. It‚Äôs the engine behind every hasty wedding, every balcony suicide, every matching tattoo half remembered from a drunken night on Fremont Street. The Lovers powered all the chapel lights on the Strip and the divorce courts in Henderson. Now it was gone. Or worse‚Äîrewritten.

I told Rex I was out of that game. I‚Äôd paid my debt. I‚Äôd cut my strings. He just looked at me with that crooked Elvis grin, winked, and said I already knew better. And he was right. Because when a Major goes missing, the city bends. And this one bent hard.

Within hours, people were falling out of love like bad investments. Vows unraveled in midair. Rings cracked and disappeared from fingers. Marriage licenses burned themselves in county records. Magicians found their assistants walking away in the middle of routines. Bartenders forgot the names of their long-lost flings. Entire relationships collapsed like shoddy card houses built too close to the edge. It wasn‚Äôt chaos exactly. It was something worse. It was narrative subtraction. The Lovers weren‚Äôt just missing. They‚Äôd been rewritten, stripped out of the cosmic spread.

Only one group had the means to do that.

The Oracle Syndicate.

They weren‚Äôt ghosts. And they weren‚Äôt precisely human anymore either. The Oracle Syndicate is what happens when people sleep too long under cursed motel blankets with mirror lined ceilings. They‚Äôre dreamers who never fully woke up. The city melted into them, or maybe they melted into the city. It doesn‚Äôt matter anymore. What matters is that they believe in Vegas as a dreaming machine. A vast engine that converts stories into power. The hotels are gears. The tourists are kindling. The stories are currency. And like any good syndicate, they wanted control.

Word was, they‚Äôd tried to bring Reno Mallory into the fold once, back when he still had a stage show and a heartbeat. He refused. He wanted to build his own deck, not serve anyone else‚Äôs draw. That didn‚Äôt end well for either of us.

Now the Oracle Syndicate wanted me.

They left signs.

At the Flamingo gift shop, a Queen of Hearts drawn in lipstick on a mannequin‚Äôs face. At a roulette table in the basement of the shut-down Tropicana, a dead showgirl splayed like a ritual offering, sequins arranged into a Tarot circle, the Lovers conspicuously absent. And finally, the clearest invitation: a gold coin inside my coffee cup at the Peppermill. It bore a heart split by lightning and three words stamped across the edge, Second Draw.

You don‚Äôt ignore a draw like that. Not in this city. Not when the deck‚Äôs already got your scent.

I followed the thread through the city‚Äôs broken spaces, static zones where time flickers and memory loops in strange spirals. The Stardust parking lot, haunted by music from a lounge act that never existed. The silent fountain behind the Venetian that only runs if someone nearby has recently drowned. And finally, the Chapel of Unnamed Vows, a ruin where rings vanish and names go mute and promises dissolve into smoke.

There, I met her.

They called her the Heartbinder. She wore a veil made from discarded wedding photos, brittle and sun-bleached, and smelled of scorched champagne and motel heartbreak. They say she used to work the counters at a chapel on Industrial Road, back in the 1960s, until she saw too many broken oaths and finally became one herself. She didn‚Äôt blink when I approached. She didn‚Äôt have to.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been unmoored,‚Äù she said. Her voice wasn‚Äôt cruel, just tired. ‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre still the Fool. But the deck‚Äôs moved on.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat am I now?‚Äù I asked.

She took my hand. Turned it over like a dealer stalling for drama. Her fingers were cold, but not dead. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre becoming the Magician. Tools in hand. Symbols at your back. Power misunderstood.‚Äù

And I hated that. Because the Magician doesn‚Äôt just play the game. He sets the table. He makes the rules dance. He manipulates the spread and pretends it‚Äôs fate. If I was the Magician now, it meant the city wasn‚Äôt just testing me.

It was offering me control.

And that‚Äôs always the first trap.

I found the Oracle Syndicate under the Bellagio. Literally under it. There‚Äôs a vault from the original construction, long sealed off, that was said to be cursed by the first floor manager to die there. I cracked it open with a counterfeit key and a prayer to something older than neon. Inside, I found a hall of broken mirrors, each one showing the Strip from a different decade. Men in leisure suits, women in sequined gowns, armies of ghosts drinking martinis and dealing cards into the dark. The Syndicate stood in a circle of salt and static. Their leader, Bellwether, wore a dress made of misprinted dice and teeth pulled from retired dealers. She looked like an accident waiting to become a religion.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been drawing too long,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou touched the core. You‚Äôre warping the structure.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt come here for theory,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI came for the Lovers.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt hesitate. She reached into her sleeve and pulled out a card. But it wasn‚Äôt Tarot. It wasn‚Äôt even magic. It was a photograph.

Two people.

Mallory.

And me.

Sitting in a booth at the Peppermill. Laughing. Wearing rings.

‚ÄúYou were the Lovers,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBefore the rewrite.‚Äù

I stared. My memories resisted, scrambled, then relented. Mallory‚Äôs hand on mine. A shared promise beneath neon rain. And a vow that someone must‚Äôve erased, then rewritten into this story.

‚ÄúWe bound the Lovers to the future,‚Äù Bellwether continued. ‚ÄúThe past was rotting. Too many broken loops. Vegas needed a new narrative. One where the arc bends forward.‚Äù

And I saw what they were doing.

They weren‚Äôt just stealing cards anymore. They were evolving the deck. Replacing stagnant ghosts with dynamic roles. Giving the dead not closure, but transformation. Mallory had tried to torch the old spread. The Syndicate was planting a new one in its ashes.

And maybe, just maybe, I didn‚Äôt hate it.

But I don‚Äôt trust Vegas miracles. They always cost more than the receipt says.

So I took the Lovers card and left.

Now I carry it in my coat pocket, tucked behind the pyramid-folded Ten of Swords. Two cards. One of pain. One of promise. Both incomplete.

I still work the backrooms. Still deal for clients no one living remembers. Some bring cards that hum with blood. Others play with scraps of dream. A few gamble their names.

Vegas doesn‚Äôt end.

It shuffles.

And every time I cut the deck, I wonder what new role the city‚Äôs about to cast me in.

Because I‚Äôm not the Fool anymore.

And I‚Äôm not the Magician yet.

I‚Äôm somewhere between.

And the deck is watching.

New hand. New draw. The table is set.

It's that weird pain you get in your back teeth when you first bite into unripe fruit or berries. Not the same as dry mouth from bitter foods‚Äîthat happens every time, doesn't affect your teeth, and isn't painful at all. I could just describe it like that in my text, but that would be too wordy for my tastes‚Äîno pun intended.

I'd describe *–æ—Å–∫–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞* as a sudden, sharp(ish) pain in the lower molars and jaw. It's not just a shock or an ongoing soreness, though: it almost feels like there's something twisting and pulling on the roots. While uncomfortable, it's usually not bad enough that you couldn't maintain a politely bland expression. At most, the pain level is like taking a bite of ice cream right after a sip of coffee (though the location and quality of the pain is obviously different).

Some people get *–æ—Å–∫–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞* from first bites or sips of *anything* that's even slightly sour / acidic. Sometimes, overly sweet things can trigger it as well, but it can be pretty random. It's just that initial taste, though, and goes away in under a minute. Apparently, drinking water can help minimize the risk of this happening and make it go away faster.

As I said, it's *not* the same as that dry mouth sensation you get from bitter stuff like overbrewed / too-strong black tea or, again, unripe fruit‚Äîespecially the kind that's supposed to be sweet when ripe. In Russian, they say that whatever gave you this dryness sensation ""ties your mouth in knots"" (–≤—è–∂–µ—Ç —Ä–æ—Ç), which is a really good way to describe it. I think it's the tannins in the food / beverage, but don't quote me on that. 

I'll try to highlight the differences. *–û—Å–∫–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞* happens in the back of the mouth, in the teeth and jaw, whereas this tangy dryness sensation is all over the mouth and *isn't* painful at all. *–û—Å–∫–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞* can also be pretty unpredictable, where the same foods can be fine one day and painful the next. This mouth-drying bitterness happens pretty much every time, though, and doesn't go away if you don't dilute the bitterness, either with a drink of water or with something sweet.",1,1750916928.0,translator,2,0.67,False

Maybe it's your breath hitching in your throat.

Maybe it's the sound of your own heartbeat turning into thunder. Or maybe it's the way the ground suddenly feels like it's tilting beneath your feet, and you're just... falling.

I wasn't supposed to be home tonight. My work trip to Boston was meant to last four days‚Äîstiff suits, bland hotel breakfasts, investor pitches. But I finished the presentation in half the time. Two days flat. Efficient. Strategic. I was proud.

I imagined Nathan's surprise when I walked through the door, maybe even a little turned on. I wanted to be spontaneous again. The wife who used to wake him with kisses, not reminders about dry cleaning.

So I went all out.

Merlot from the overpriced wine shop on 13th. The silky black nightgown he once said made me ""too tempting to function."" My heels in one hand, the wine in the other. My heart humming with hope, as I crept down the hallway of our apartment building, imagining the smile on his face.

The door creaked open with a gentle push. The living room, dim and bathed in the soft golden hue of the lamp, was wrong. Jazz played through the speakers. Nathan didn't even like jazz.

Something felt off.

I walked inside, my bare feet making no noise on the cold marble floor. The wine clinked softly in my hand as I moved closer ahead. The anticipation in my heart was strong‚Äînothing like the gladness I'd visualized.

Then I heard it.

A moan.

Low. Deep. Female.

I froze. My mind scrambled for an explanation. A movie? His phone? Maybe he fell asleep to something inappropriate? But then I heard his voice‚Äîclose, groaning.

And her again. Louder. More urgent. More intense

I dropped the wine.

The bottle broke, the red liquid content bleeding onto the marble floor like a wounded artery. I didn't even batter an eye.

Something inside me went dead.

I moved toward the bedroom, barely breathing. Each step felt heavier than the last. My fingers brushed the wall, searching for something solid to hold onto. But even the familiar texture of the paint felt foreign beneath my skin.

The door was slightly open, glowing with a sliver of golden light that spilled into the hallway like a secret. From inside, I heard it‚Äîsoft gasps, breathless and intimate. The rhythm of bodies moving in synchrony.

Whispers of pleasure, like prayers at an altar of desire.

I wanted to turn back. To pretend I was still outside with the wine, still holding onto hope like a fool with a gift in my hand and love on my tongue. But something pulled me forward.

The truth, maybe.

Or the cruel part of my heart that needed to know.

I pushed the door open.

And my world... stopped.

Time didn't slow‚Äîit fractured.

There he was. Nathan. The man who had once sworn his forever into my hands beneath the soft petals of springtime roses. The man whose laughter had filled our home, whose touch had once been the only thing that quieted my racing mind.

Now he was a stranger.

Naked. Moving. Drowned in the kind of s\*\*\*\*l drive that was supposed to belong to us‚Äînot borrowed, not stolen, not given away like an unbearable song. His back arched, muscles taut beneath a sheen of sweat dripping on his exerted body.

His hands held firmly to the sheets like he was holding onto life itself, knuckles white, desperate. And his mouth‚Äîoh My God‚Äîhis mouth was pressed into her soft delicate neck, tracing down her skin with a reverence that killed something sacred on my inside.

She held unto him as though they were meant to be, her body a perfect expression to his lustful desires. Legs tangled at his hips, hands holding unto his backside. She moved with him‚Äîfluid, fevered, soft‚Äîas if they had rehearsed every moment, like their bodies had desperately wanted to be in sync for far too long.

I stood stupefied, eyes wide open and mouth ajar. My lungs failed me, my body a vessel of nothing but shock and disbelief. The air around me felt too thin, too unconducive.

The sound of their intimacy, once soft, now rumbled in my ears, drowning out the pounding of my heart.

I didn't let tears drop down my cheek. Not yet. Tears required belief, and all I had was disbelief‚Äîpure, undiluted, suffocating. As though it was all a dream.

And then‚Äîshe turned.

Not fully. Just a part of her head, her eyes catching mine over Nathan's shoulder.

For a second, the world stopped spinning. Her face was a blur, but her eyes‚Äîshock, recognition, fear‚Äîflickered in them.

In a frantic movement, she shoved Nathan off her limbs, scrambling to cover herself. Nathan blinked, confused at first. His body still lost in pleasure, his gaze following hers‚Äîuntil it landed on me.

Everything changed in an instant.

He whispered my name, but it was too late. The damage had been done. The room, once ours, was now haunted, and I was the ghost.

""Don't,"" I choked, the words barely scraping past the rawness in my throat.

Nathan moved toward me, his eyes frantic, pleading. His mouth opened, but nothing came out. The woman‚Äîher‚Äîhad already fled, disappearing into the night.

I hadn't seen her face, but the memory of her desperate flight was burned into my mind, her body twisting as she scrambled to escape what she knew was about to happen. Something fell off from her body.

I didn't even notice the woman's hasty departure at first, too stunned by the scene in front of me.

But what fell off...

A silver bracelet‚Äîher silver bracelet‚Äîlay abandoned on the marble floor, like a cruel reminder of everything I hadn't wanted to know.

I reached down with trembling fingers, the cold metal biting into my skin as I grasped it, the weight of it pulling me back into the moment. The bracelet was still warm with the heat of her skin. It felt wrong in my hand‚Äîforeign, yet too familiar.

Nathan stepped forward, his face a mask of panic and regret. His voice cracked as he tried to find words, but they faltered before they could take shape. ""Jane... please, you didn't see her face."" His eyes darted between me and the floor, as if searching for some way to undo what had already been done.

""I... I can't tell you who she is. I‚Äî"" His words trailed off, a choked breath replacing any attempt at explanation.

His hesitation‚Äîhis complete lack of clarity‚Äîcut deeper than anything he could have said. The silence that followed was worse than any confession. It was the absence of understanding, the failure to recognize the depth of the damage.

I wanted to shout at him, to fling the bracelet at his chest and demand answers. But my body betrayed me. The only thing I could do was clutch the bracelet tighter, feeling the cold metal dig into my palm, grounding me in the wreckage of a life I never thought would fall apart. At least even if it would not in this manner.

Without uttering a word, I turned, each step heavy, like the floor itself was resisting me, pulling me back to that fractured moment. But I had to go. The dreadful silence in that room was too much, and as I stepped further away from him I knew deep within me that this situation was one that I couldn't salvage.

The one thing left in my palm was the cold, familiar bracelet‚Äîthe one that had fallen off the mystery woman.

# Chapter 2

(Jane's POV)

I didn't remember how I made it down the stairs‚Äîor how I ended up outside, the city's breath slapping me in the face. I think I ran, but my legs moved on their own. The cold night air whipped against my skin, but I didn't care.

I just kept going‚Äîbecause if I stopped, the weight of what I'd seen would crush me.

Taxi lights blurred by. Somewhere behind me, I thought I heard Nathan call my name‚Äîbut maybe it was in my head. I didn't look back.

I flagged down a taxi, told the driver to take me to the Musk Hotel. The ride was short. When we arrived, I paid the fare and walked straight to the entrance without hesitation. The doorman opened the brass-trimmed doors, and I stepped into another world‚Äîa cleaner, quieter one than the wreck I'd just left behind.

The lobby shimmered with light. Chandeliers hung like smug little stars, oblivious to my unraveling. My heels clicked against black marble, each step aching.

I pulled my coat tighter‚Äînot for warmth, but to keep from falling apart.

""Good evening, ma'am. Welcome to the Musk Suites. Do you have a reservation?"" the concierge asked with a polite smile.

I almost laughed. Reservation? As if anything in my life was planned.

""No,"" I said quietly. ""Just... an executive room. Somewhere secluded.""

He typed quickly, avoiding my eyes. Maybe it was the way I looked‚Äîcocktail dress, streaked mascara, the emptiness in my voice. Either way, he asked no questions and handed me the keycard.

Minutes later, I was inside a suite with giant windows overlooking the city.

Lights sparkled from distant towers, but I felt hollow. I dropped my purse, slid down the wall, and sat there‚Äîgasping. Not crying. Just gasping for air.

The silver bracelet burned in my palm.

I'd held it so tightly that it left angry impressions on my skin. Slowly, I uncurled my fingers and stared at it‚Äîsleek, delicate... familiar. I'd seen it before.

This wasn't some stranger's jewelry.

No, the woman who wore this‚Äîshe was someone I'd known.

Inside the band, etched in faint script, was a single word.

""To J. ‚Äì Forever.""

Forever......

The word echoed through my mind like a bad joke.

I let out a subtle laugh, then flinched at the sound. It was too loud. Too hurtful.

I stood and crossed the room, pouring myself a glass of water with shaking hands.

Then, without further thought, I dropped the bracelet on the golden hotel linen like it was an intriguing object. I stared at it, as though by so doing I would jug my memories as to whom it belonged to. Nothing came. No flashes. No revelations

Who was she?

What kind of woman slept with another woman's husband and left behind a token like a signature?

I paced through the right corner of my bed. Then stopped. Then sat. Then stood again.

""Get a grip of yourself, Jane,"" I muttered to myself. ""Think.""

But my thoughts were scattered‚Äîfragments of moments I didn't want to relive.

Nathan's eyes.

The way he hadn't chased after me.

The c\*\*\*k in his voice when he said, ""I can't tell you who she is.""

He was protecting her.

Why?

Maybe I should've paid closer attention to the woman as she fled‚Äîwatched how she moved, what she wore, anything that could've helped me identify her. But I hadn't. I was too overwhelmed, too broken in the moment to see clearly. And now all I had was a bitter question that refused to let me be.

I grabbed my phone, my fingers hovering over Nathan's name. I wanted to return his calls. I wanted to scream until he gave me answers. But what if he didn't? What if he gave me more silence?

No.

The screen lit up again‚Äîhis name flashing for the seventh time that night. He had been calling non-stop since I walked out. Each call I ignored was another nail in the coffin of what we once shared. I couldn't bring myself to answer. Not yet. Maybe never again.

Let him sit in the silence this time.

I needed to think. Strategize.

I opened the hotel's vanity drawer and pulled out a notepad. I wrote down the inscription. ""J."" That didn't narrow it much‚ÄîJanet, Jessica, Jasmine, Joanna. It could be anyone.

But the bracelet looked expensive and finely crafted. Custom-made. The clasp was unique, almost vintage. I took a photo, then flipped it over and studied the engraving again.

I needed help.

But who would I even tell?

I had no best friend to call.

My sister had been missing for over four years now‚ÄîI had no idea where she was, or if she was even still alive.

The irony hit me so hard, I nearly laughed.

No best friend. No sister.

No one.

The thought twisted my stomach into knots, so I pulled out my laptop and began a desperate search‚ÄîGoogling jewelry designers with similar clasps, scrolling through pages of images and obscure artisan websites.

Nothing matched. Nothing turned up in the first few minutes.

And I was already running on fumes.

A sharp knock on the door jolted me.

My heart leapt into my throat.

I wasn't expecting anyone.

""Room service,"" came a muffled voice.

""I didn't order anything,"" I said, my voice stern.

A brief pause. Then, ""Compliments of the Musk Suites. A small refreshment tray for our exclusive guests.""

I hesitated, then cracked the door open just enough to see a young man in a crisp uniform standing there with a silver tray. I stepped aside, letting him in, my eyes never leaving him as he placed it gently on the table.

""Need anything else, ma'am?""

""No. Thank you.""

He left with a polite nod, and I sank into the chair, staring at the untouched arrangement of fruit and sparkling water. Tucked beneath the edge of the glass was a folded note. My breath caught.

I picked it up.

But it was just a printed welcome message. Generic. Harmless.

I let out a shaky breath. I was getting paranoid.

I covered my face with both hands and groaned. Then I whispered, trying to anchor myself to something that made sense.

""Okay. Tomorrow. You'll go to that custom jewelry store on Freedom Drive. Someone has to know where this bracelet came from.""

Even as I spoke it aloud, the words felt like a fragile thread‚Äîsomething to cling to in the wake of everything that had unraveled.

But the ache was already setting into my bones.

A slow, gnawing grief. Not just for the betrayal.

But for the life I thought I had‚Äîthe marriage, the trust, the warmth of knowing someone and being known.

Gone.

I lay on the bed in the soft dim light, the bracelet beside me on the pillow. Its surface gleamed like a secret in the dark. I stared at the ceiling, listening to the muted hum of the city outside the window, wishing I could silence the storm inside me.

At some point, when sleep refused to come, I whispered the question that had been clawing at me since the moment it all fell apart.

""Why me?""

The silence didn't answer.

Only the bracelet shimmered in response.

Just as I reached for it again, my phone buzzed on the nightstand.

Nathan.

This time, it wasn't a call. It was a message.

Jane,

I know you won't take my calls, and I understand why. I don't deserve your voice after what I did. I don't know what to say that could ever undo what you saw, what you felt.

But please believe this‚ÄîI am sorry. From the deepest part of me. Not just for the act, but for the lies, the silence, the pain I caused you.

I've been sitting here, drowning in guilt, knowing I can't fix it. And maybe that's the worst part‚Äîrealizing I destroyed something beautiful because I was too weak to face the truth myself.

Maybe it's best we go our separate ways. Maybe the divorce will give us both the peace we can't seem to find together anymore.

But I will always regret this. And I will always remember you as the best part of my life.

Please take care of yourself. You deserve more than I ever gave.

‚ÄîNathan

I stared at the screen long after the message faded.

Hot tears streaming down my cheeks...........

# Chapter 3

(Jane's POV)

I stared at the screen long after the message faded, spit trailing down my mouth as hot tears streamed down my cheeks, smudging the already ruined mascara. My fingers clenched around the phone, knuckles aching.

""Maybe the divorce will give us both the peace...""

The words hung in the air like the stench of something decayed.

It was one thing to be lied to, to walk in on the man you swore you could vouch for buried in someone else's arms. But this?

This was him giving up.

And maybe that was what hurt the most.

Not the act itself‚Äî

But how easily he was unwilling to take responsibility for his actions.

If anyone should be asking for a divorce, it ought to be me. I'm the one who's been hurt here.

I paced the room like a woman on the brink‚Äîsix steps to the window, six steps back. The city glittered beneath me in a thousand indifferent lights, each mocking my unraveling sanity. Just outside my door, the faint murmur of heels clicking and laughter echoed through the hallway.

""Girl, I swear Club Mevron is just a block from here,"" one woman's voice drifted through the corridor.

""Ugh, thank God. I need a drink and a distraction,"" another giggled.

I stood stupefied. Club Mevron. A block away.

A distraction.

It wasn't a plan. It was an impulse. And right now, that was all I had.

I didn't think‚Äîdidn't want to. I grabbed my clutch, slipped into the red cocktail dress I'd never worn, and left the hotel like my sanity depended on it.

The night air slapped me in the face, but it was better than the heaviness weighing down inside me. The doorman barely glanced up as I stepped onto the sidewalk and followed the pulsating sound of bass and laughter down the street.

Five minutes later, I pushed through the gilded doors of Club Mevron.

The bass thrummed through the walls like a second heartbeat. Velvet lounges, silver-trimmed tables, and mirrored ceilings gave the place an illusion of grandeur‚Äîlike money had dressed up pain and called it a party.

I slipped into a booth at the far end. The red dress clung to me firmly, putting my curves on full display. I didn't care how many people stared. Let them. Let them wonder what kind of woman comes alone to a place like this‚Äîeyes dead, lips tight.

""Double gin. No lime,"" I told the bartender when he stopped in front of me.

He raised an eyebrow, probably noticing the damage. ""Rough night?""

I laughed‚Äîhollow, sharp. ""You could say that again.""

He didn't press. Just nodded and slid the glass toward me.

I downed the first sip like it owed me something. The burn hit hard, and I welcomed it. It was familiar, the kind of pain I could control. I wasn't the type to drink like this, but right now, my body felt like a stranger's.

Within minutes, two men approached. Slick suits. Colognes that screamed distaste.

""Hey there, pretty thing,"" the first one drawled. ""What's a beauty like you doing all alone tonight?""

""Plotting a murder,"" I said flatly.

They laughed‚Äîone nervously, the other still cocky. ""Feisty. I like that.""

""I don't like you,"" I snapped, eyes flashing. ""Now run along before I pour this drink on your stupid face.""

They got the message. Mumbled something about 'crazy women' and drifted away.

I ordered another drink.

""You really do know how to clear a room.""

The voice came from behind me‚Äîdeep, amused, male.

I turned.

A man stood there, tall, rugged in a suit that didn't try too hard. He didn't smile like the others. He watched me like he already knew the story.

""And you are?"" I asked, eyebrow raised.

""Andrew,"" he said. ""Andrew Dole.""

The name clicked in my head like a drawer I'd long forgotten slamming open.

""Nathan's friend?"" I asked, blinking harder now, trying to focus on the man sitting across from me.

The club lights shimmered off the whiskey in his glass, off the sharp edge of his jawline. Everything about him was too put-together for someone supposedly estranged.

He gave a wry smile, the kind that suggested history‚Äîdeep, bitter, complicated. ""Used to be. Childhood friend, yes. 'Estranged' would be the polite term now.""

I narrowed my eyes. ""And you just happened to be here tonight?""

""No,"" he slid into the booth without asking, the scent of something expensive and dangerous trailing behind him. ""I saw you walk in. Recognized you immediately. Couldn't resist.""

I scoffed. ""Well, congratulations. You found the broken wife.""

""No,"" he said, voice softer, deliberate. ""I found the woman he didn't deserve.""

That silenced me.

I stared at him. He stared back.

Something in the way he looked at me‚Äîsteady, unflinching‚Äîmade me feel seen in a way Nathan never had, not even on our best days. And that terrified me. ""How much do you know?"" I whispered, my voice barely above the pulse of the music.

He tilted his head, eyes dark with something unreadable. ""Not enough to have all the pieces... just enough to know you shouldn't be here alone.""

I narrowed my gaze. ""That's not an answer.""

He shrugged, sipping his drink. ""Nathan and I haven't spoken in years, but people talk. And when they do, they talk to me. Your name came up. Rumors. Whispers. Something about a woman storming out of the Frank estate......""

I blinked back another wave of dizziness‚Äîequal parts alcohol and emotion. ""So what, you came to play knight in shining armor?""

He leaned in, close enough for his cologne to drown the rest of the room. ""No. I came because I know exactly what betrayal tastes like. And because I figured... you might want someone who understands. Even if only for tonight.""

He smirked, the kind that made it impossible to tell if he was flirting or scheming.

""By the way, I have a proposition for you.""

That pulled me back to full alert. ""A proposition?""

He swirled the amber liquid in his glass, eyes never leaving mine. ""More like a contract. Between you and me. One that could change everything‚Äîif you're willing to play.""

I tilted my head, the gin buzzing beneath my skin. ""I'm listening...""

He leaned in, elbows on the table, his voice smooth but firm. ""We get married. For two years. Publicly. Legally. The whole deal.""

I blinked. Then laughed‚Äîa short, breathless sound. ""You're joking.""

""I'm not.""

""You want to marry me?"" I asked, barely believing the words coming out of my mouth.

""Not out of love,"" he said quickly, eyes never leaving mine. ""This is strategy. Optics. Leverage.""

""Against Nathan?""

""Partly,"" he admitted. ""But it's more than that. You need protection right now‚Äîreal protection. Nathan's got resources, connections, lawyers who would bleed you dry in a real divorce. I have more power than he realizes. We use my name, my assets, my reputation. You become untouchable.""

I stared at him, my mind racing back to Nathan's text. ""And in return?""

He didn't flinch. ""You help me break into the circle Nathan's spent years protecting. His investors, his board, his empire. He's not as clean as he pretends. I've been gathering proof. But I need someone close to him.

Someone he still watches... obsesses over.""

""Me,"" I murmured.

He nodded. ""You were always the part of his life he couldn't fully control. Now, you'll be the key to bringing him down.""

My stomach swirled with the alcohol and the weight of his words. ""So... I'd be your pawn.""

""No,"" he said softly, brushing a strand of hair from my face with an ease that sent a flutter through my throat. ""You'd be my partner.""

I stared at him, stupefied. ""Two years?""

""Two years,"" he said. ""After that, we part ways. Cleanly. No pressure. No strings. But by then... you'll be standing stronger than ever.""

For a moment, neither of us moved.

Then Andrew reached for my hand‚Äînot boldly, but gently, like he was testing if I'd flinch.

I didn't. ""Why are you doing this?"" I whispered, my voice barely above the pulse of the music. ""You barely know me.""

He didn't break eye contact. His thumb moved in slow, feather-light strokes over my knuckles, grounding me in a moment I hadn't expected to need.

""Because I've been where you are,"" he said quietly. ""And because... I think you deserve someone in your corner. Someone who isn't trying to fix or claim you. Just‚Äîsee you.""

My throat tightened.

A part of me wanted to pull away, retreat into the safety of sarcasm or silence. But another part‚Äîone weary from pretending to be okay‚Äîleaned forward.

Our lips met, tentative at first. No urgency. No fire.

Just warmth.

Just human.

He cupped my jaw, fingers trailing behind my ear, and I let myself sink into the kiss‚Äîsoft, steady, like the kind that whispered you're safe here.

For one breathless moment, Nathan didn't exist.

The betrayal didn't exist.

Even the bracelet

I'd found didn't exist.

It was just him and me.

And the quiet question hovering between us.

But just as I let myself begin to breathe‚Äî

BUZZZZZ.

The phone vibrated on the table, loud against the polished glass.

I glanced down.

\[CALLER ID: JULIA\]

My breath caught in my throat.

No.

No, no, no.

This had to be a dream.

# Chapter 4

(Jane's POV)

Moments earlier, I'd left the club in a haze. The music still pulsed faintly in my ears, but it was Andrew's proposition that refused to let go. It looped in my head like a drunken lullaby‚Äîuninvited, inescapable.

A contract.

A public strike. A calculated blow to Nathan's pride. Not just emotional revenge, but surgical. Wounding. And the worst part? It tempted me. Andrew had walked me back to the suite, his presence hovering like a ghost behind me, silent but thick with unspoken words.

I could barely recall the elevator ride. My thoughts were already unraveling.

At the door, he paused.

""I'll leave you to think about it, Jane."" His voice was soft, a thread of understanding beneath the edge.

""You know where to find me.""

I nodded‚Äîor maybe I didn't. I couldn't be sure. Once inside, I shut the door and sagged against it, as if the room itself might collapse under the weight I carried. My heels hit the floor with a sharp thud. I didn't bother turning on the lamps.

The room's overhead light blinked on automatically, sterile and too bright, washing over me like an interrogation. I reached for the bottle of wine on the nightstand. Half gone.

With clumsy fingers, I poured another glass, barely catching the spill as it sloshed over the rim. I took a deep gulp, then another. My lips were already stained, my tongue too loose in my mouth. Everything was warm. Fuzzy.

The wine didn't dull the ache in my chest. It only made the questions louder.

What the hell was I doing?

I collapsed onto the bed, face pressed to the pillow. Maybe I cried. Maybe I just laid there breathing hard. The alcohol made it hard to tell.

My body felt like it was floating, but my mind was drowning‚Äîdragged under by everything I didn't want to face.

Nathan. The lies. The end of us.

And Andrew's offer, whispered like sin in a dark booth, now echoing like a dare.

I turned my head and stared blankly at the desk across the room. My vision blurred, cleared, blurred again. Something glinted there. Caught my eye.

The bracelet.

God. That damned bracelet.

It was half-hidden beneath a notepad, but I saw it. I felt it. A small, twisted reminder of a woman I still hadn't identified.

The woman who ran. The woman Nathan had touched like he used to touch me.

I sat up‚Äîtoo fast. The room tilted, spinning sideways in a lazy spiral. I laughed under my breath, low and bitter.

Of course I was drunk.

But not drunk enough to forget that‚Äîthe way he touched her‚Äîthe way he used to touch me.

I thought Nathan's breakup text would be the end. The end of the pain. The questions. The search.

But I was wrong. So very wrong.

I stumbled toward the desk, one hand brushing the wall for balance. When I picked the bracelet up, it was ice against my fingertips. Delicate. Ornate. Too familiar.

I held it up. Squinted. My head buzzed as I turned it over in my palm. The pattern. The clasp. It tugged at Something about the bracelet tugged at me‚Äîburied deep in memory, like d√©j√† vu wearing someone else's face.

Then the weight of it hit me, full-force, like a bad aroma curling around my spine.

Had I seen it before?

No... Had I worn it before?

The question snaked through my foggy mind, refusing to let go. And then my phone buzzed again.

I jumped.

It lit up on the nightstand beside the half-empty wine glass, the vibration slicing through the silence.

Julia.

Again.

I blinked at the screen, disoriented. For a second, it felt like I was dreaming agian‚Äîlike the alcohol had conjured her from the depths of my guilt, my questions, my rage.

I had tried to pick up earlier, back at the club. But the line cut. When I called back, it rang once, then nothing. Dead air. Unreachable.

Now, her name was blinking at me again.

My thumb hovered above the screen. My heart stuttered. We hadn't spoken in four years.

.

I called her back.

""Jane?"" Her voice was tentative, breathy, like a child testing water with her toes.

""Julia..."" I whispered. ""Are you okay?"" A long silence stretched between us. ""I think we should talk. Face to face.""

\*\*

And now, I stood at the open-air atrium of the Victoria Galleria, watching shoppers pass with the kind of ease I hadn't known in weeks. Caf√© Brago sat nestled in the corner, with jasmine hanging from the trellis and soft acoustic music floating from the speakers. It was the kind of place Julia would choose.

Pretentious, but private. She was already there. White blouse. Pale denim. Sunglasses perched atop a chestnut-colored bob she hadn't worn when we were twenty-five.

Her posture was almost... fragile. And when she saw me, she stood quickly‚Äîtoo quickly‚Äîand her smile wavered like it didn't quite belong on her face. ""Jane,"" she breathed. I didn't speak at first. I just stared. Four years without a single word. Not a birthday call. Not even a postcard. And yet... her arms opened. I stepped in.

Not because forgiveness came easily. But because part of me needed this too‚Äîneeded to remember that I had family. That something once broken might not be shattered. When we sat, it was stiff. Awkward. We ordered coffees just to have something to stir.

""You look..."" she trailed off.

""Tired?"" I offered. She smiled faintly. ""Stronger."" ""You still live in the city?""

""Coming from you, that sounds like a strange question.""

""I didn't even know you were back,"" I said. ""I thought you were in Spain.""

""I was. Madrid. Then Barcelona. But I came home six months ago.""

Six months. I blinked. ""You didn't think to call?""

Her face flinched. ""I did. A thousand times. I just... didn't.""

I didn't press it. I stirred my coffee. ""I'm sorry about your marriage,"" she said after a beat. ""I heard... something happened?""

My eyes flicked up to hers. ""Yeah. Something.""

""I won't ask if you don't want to talk about it.""

""Thanks."" I paused. ""But yeah. I came home early from a trip and caught Nathan in bed with someone.""

Julia went still. The straw in her drink stopped moving.

""I'm so sorry,"" she said, softer now. ""God. Jane...""

""Don't be. It's done."" ""Do you know who it was?"" I shook my head. ""She ran. All I got was a glimpse and this bracelet.""

""Bracelet?"" Her voice cracked the tiniest bit. I reached into my bag and pulled it out.

Silver. Feminine. Still cold somehow, like betrayal had left its fingerprints on it.

She stared. I watched her face for any sign. Any reaction.

But all I got was a long blink and a nod.

""Pretty,"" she said, her voice just above a whisper. ""Delicate.""

""Makes me sick to look at it,"" I muttered, slipping it back into my bag.

We talked for a while longer. About Mom. About growing up. About how things fell apart between us after Dad's funeral. It was strange. Surreal. Like patching up cracks in a wall that was still on fire.

Then she checked her watch.

""I should go,"" she said. ""I have‚Äî""

""Julia,"" I cut in. She looked up. ""I'm glad you called.""

Her eyes glistened. ""I almost didn't. But I couldn't carry it anymore.""

""Carry what?""

Her lips parted.

She hesitated.

And then‚Äî

""The bracelet is mine""

""I was the one,"" she whispered. ""In the house. That night. With Nathan.""

# Chapter 5

(Jane's POV)

""I was the one,"" Julia muttered. ""In the house. That night. With Nathan.""

The clink of glasses, the hum of quiet conversations, and the soft jazz floating from the ceiling speakers all seemed to collapse into a heavy silence. The air inside Caf√© Brago thickened, pressing in around me until I could only hear the slow, thunderous beat of my heart, pounding louder than everything else.

I stared at her.

Not blinking. Not breathing.

The coffee in my cup had become cold, barely touched. My fingers trembled slightly over the porcelain handle, but I remained motionless. My joints have failed me. My body clenched as if to keep me from cracking wide open.

Julia's eyes did not look at mine.

They drifted just below, on the table, on the floor, or anywhere else but my face.

I opened my mouth, but words failed me. Julia shifted in her seat. She appeared... lighter, as if she had just unloaded a boulder. My pain, it seemed, was her freedom.

""I should go,"" she said, reaching for her bag.

Is that it? What? No explanation? No apologies?

Could it be that I'm dreaming?

I still couldn't speak. My tongue felt like sandpaper, my chest locked tight in a corset of disbelief.

She stood. Straightened her White blouse. Her hands fidgeted for a second before she glanced toward the caf√© exit.

""I only came to offload the weight of what I've done.""

She turned.

And just like that, she left.

I didn't follow her. I didn't call out. I just sat there, frozen, watching as she walked away. She didn't look back. Not once. Her dress caught the wind like a whisper, trailing behind her as she walked away.

I sat still, trapped in the aftermath of her revelation, until a sweet voice broke through the fog.

""Ma'am... Are you alright?""

I blinked. A waitress stood by the table's edge, concern on her brow, her tray loosely held at her side. She must have noticed me sitting there, motionless, long after the last sip of coffee had gone cold.

""I‚Äî"" My voice caught in my throat.

I swallowed hard. ""Yes. I'm good.""

She didn't look convinced, but she nodded anyway and stepped away with quiet understanding.

I reached for my purse with hands that barely felt like mine. Sliding a few bills onto the table‚Äîfar more than the coffee was worth‚Äî I rose slowly, as if my body had aged in minutes, each movement stiff with the weight of her confession. My coat felt heavier now as I cinched it tightly around me, as if it could protect me from the reality that had just broken quietly between two cups of coffee.

Then, without looking back, I walked out of Caf√© Brago and into the thinning afternoon, the city swallowing me whole.

I didn't know where else to go but back to The Musk Hotel‚Äîthe one place that had become both a torment and a refuge since the day everything fell apart. I barely recalled the elevator ride to the executive wing of the hotel. My body moved on its own, numb fingers pressing the button, eyes fixed on the glowing numbers as they ascended‚Äîeach floor a quiet scream echoing inside my head.

The familiar faded-gold hallway. The smell of musk and soft pine that gave the hotel its name. My hand trembled as I unlocked the door and stepped into the room, the soft thud of the door behind me finally snapping the silence.

She was the one. Julia.

My twin. My blood. My mirror.

I sat on the edge of the bed, staring at the floor, with the bracelet‚Äîher bracelet‚Äîstill nestled in my bag like a silent traitor. My chest felt hollow, as if someone had scooped the air out and left just weight. It wasn't anger. Not yet. Just a dense, unwinding anguish that began in my stomach and expanded outward, slowly and heavily.

I leaned back on the cushions, staring at the ceiling. That's when the memories began to rush in.

We were eight the first time Julia tricked me and laughed about it for hours. I had a presentation at school, and she swapped my cue cards with a handwritten list of boy names and ""secret crushes."" I stood in front of the entire class, reading it out loud‚Äîutterly confused, until I saw her in the back row, doubled over in laughter.

""Why would you do that?"" I had cried later that day, humiliated.

Her answer was a shrug. ""You take things too seriously, Janey. It was funny.""

No apology. Just a smile, like she lived in a different moral climate than the rest of us.

When we were thirteen, I remember us sitting in the attic of Grandma Kathrine's old beach house during summer. We were painting our nails black and talking about the future.

""I want to be famous,"" Julia had said, waving her wet fingers. ""Not like a movie star, famous. Just... impossible to forget.""

""You already are,"" I replied.

She smirked. ""No. You are. You're the golden girl. Always polite. Always safe. Teachers love you, boys worship you. I'm just... the sidekick with attitude.""

""You're not a sidekick.""

""Maybe,"" she'd said, leaning back. ""But I'd rather be the villain than the shadow.""",1,1750916870.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

""Joanna, a barren woman like you is just a worthless wife who can‚Äôt even fulfill the basic role.""

Vanessa strutted over in her four-inch heels and kicked my shin with the pointed toe. ""Don't you even think the Hamptons are wasting a lot keeping a worthless woman like you?""

""Well, Mrs. Hampton, aren't you embarrassed occupying the position you don't deserve?""

""Women like you are just a complete waste of space...""

I fought back my rage and stared directly into Vanessa's heavily made-up face: ""You're just a secretary. Don't you think you're way out of line here? Since when did an outsider have the right to interfere in the Hampton family's business?""

Three years ago, the Collins family was on the edge of bankruptcy, and the Hamptons stepped in to save us.

I'll never forget the image of my father kneeling before George Hampton, begging for help.

The Hampton family's terms were crystal clear‚ÄîI had to marry Nicholas Hampton.

""Joanna's smart, she's got a good head for business. She'll make the perfect Hampton wife."" George Hampton had said at the time.

It was both gratitude and a transaction.

The Hamptons needed my business talent, and the Collins family needed financial backing.

For my father's sake, I married Nicholas Hampton.

Over these years, I'd helped Nicholas triple the company's performance and successfully took Hampton Group public.

Mrs. Susan Parks, our housekeeper, couldn't stand watching this anymore. She stepped forward and grabbed Vanessa's arm: ""Miss White, the Hamptons pay you good money. Why can't you just do your secretary job? This family's personal stuff ain't none of your business.""

Vanessa jerked her arm away and shrieked: ""Mind your own business, you old bat!""

Mrs. Parks stumbled backward but continued trying to reason with her: ""Miss White, you need to have some conscience. We've all seen what Mrs. Hampton's done for this family. You got no business messing with their marriage!""

""Shut up!"" Vanessa raised her hand to strike Mrs. Parks. ""How dare a servant try to lecture me?""

I quickly stepped forward to block her, saying coldly: ""Vanessa, Mrs. Parks has been with this family for twenty years. Even Mr. Hampton respects her. Touch her and see what happens if you dare.""

Right then, George Hampton came downstairs with a dark expression, taking in the chaotic scene in the living room, his brow furrowed deeply.

""What the hell is going on!"" George barked, his gaze sweeping over Vanessa's arrogant face. ""Susan, throw this cocky secretary out of my house!""

But Vanessa showed no fear. Instead, she stepped forward, prominently displaying her belly: ""I'd like to see anyone dare to touch me!""

She smugly rubbed her stomach. ""Mr. Hampton, take a good look‚ÄîI'm carrying the Hampton heir!""

The household staff began whispering among themselves.

""Mrs. Hampton's been here three years and nothing. Maybe she really can't have kids?""

""Shh, keep it down! But I mean, look at her belly‚Äîshe's definitely pregnant.""

""I mean, she wouldn't dare act this bold unless she was carrying a Hampton baby, right?""

""Look how cocky, bet she really is having a Hampton baby!""

Hearing these murmurs, Vanessa's lips curved into a arrogant smile.

She deliberately pushed out her slightly rounded abdomen and looked at me provocatively: ""Hear that? Even the staff can see what's obvious, but you're still living in denial.""

She turned to address the staff, raising her voice: ""When I officially become the Mrs.Hampton, everyone here today is getting double pay!""

The staff immediately grew restless, and several were already flashing obsequious smiles at Vanessa.

This made Vanessa even more smug. Her red-lacquered fingernails gently caressed her belly: ""Some people's time playing house is about to be over.""

George's face turned ashen. He stared intently at Vanessa's protruding belly with this scary, murderous look.

Chapter 2

""Enough!"" George suddenly roared, immediately silencing the staff.

Vanessa flinched at the outburst but quickly straightened her spine: ""Mr. Hampton, what do you mean? I'm carrying your‚Äî""

""Shut up!"" George slammed his fist on the coffee table, making the cups rattle violently. ""You think I don't know my own son's condition?""

He turned to look at me, a flash of guilt in his eyes: ""Joanna, the Hampton family owes you.""

I stood there, coldly watching this absurd scene unfold.

The truth was, we discovered we couldn't have children in our first year of marriage.

Nicholas and I had visited the best hospitals both domestically and abroad. The results were always the same.

The problem was with Nicholas‚Äîhe suffered from azoospermia and would never be able to get a woman pregnant.

George knew all about it.

He had even locked the medical reports in his study drawer, terrified it would get out and damage the Hampton family's reputation.

Now, watching Vanessa flaunt her belly so arrogantly, I just found it laughable.

Either she was lying, or this child couldn't possibly be Nicholas's.

I let out a cold laugh and picked up the prenatal report from the table, waving it slightly: ""Miss White, this piece of paper only proves you're pregnant. Doesn't prove it's a Hampton baby.""

George's expression turned dangerously dark as he pounded the table: ""This is insane! How dare you try to deceive my family!""

Vanessa's face went deathly pale. She bit her lip and pulled out several photos from her phone: ""Mr. Hampton, just look at these...""

The photos clearly showed Nicholas and Vanessa naked in bed together, dated three months ago.

Vanessa's eyes reddened as her voice trembled: ""That night Mr. Hampton was drunk and insisted on pulling me into‚Äî""

Suddenly, My mother-in-law Marianne rushed over and grabbed my hand, tears streaming down her face:

""Joanna, dear, I'm so sorry! All these years you've suffered in silence! What the Hampton family owes you, I'll never be able to make up for!""

She suddenly spun around and grabbed a cup from the coffee table, hurling it at Vanessa: ""You shameless bitch! How dare you treat my daughter-in-law this way!""

Vanessa dodged it smoothly, and the cup shattered at her feet. She shrieked: ""You old hag! Where was this anger when your son was sleeping with me?"" She deliberately pushed out her belly. ""Now you wanna play the saint?""

""Bullshit!""

Marianne trembled with rage, pointing at Vanessa's nose: ""A trashy piece of work like you? My son wouldn't give you a second look! Why don't you take a good look at that botched plastic surgery job you call a face!""

Vanessa sneered and pulled out another stack of photos from her purse, throwing them on the table: ""Take a good look, old hag! Here's your precious son in my bed!""

The photos clearly showed intimate shots of Nicholas and Vanessa together.

I calmly looked at the photos, feeling completely unmoved.

Actually, I'd discovered Nicholas's affairs within the first month of our marriage.

Over the years, he'd cycled through woman after woman. I'd grown numb to it long ago.

The only reasons I hadn't divorced were gratitude for George's role in saving the Collins family years ago, and because Marianne treated me like her own daughter.

Every time Nicholas got caught in some scandal, Marianne was always the first to defend me.

""I've seen plenty of photos like these,"" I said flatly. ""Miss White, you think these alone will secure your place in the Hampton family?""

Vanessa's expression shifted: ""What‚Äîwhat do you mean?""

Marianne gripped my hand tightly, her voice choked with emotion: ""Joanna, I failed to raise my son properly.""

I shook my head and pulled out a document from my purse: ""This is Nicholas's medical report from last year, clearly documenting his condition."" I looked directly at Vanessa. ""You sure that baby's really his?""

Chapter 3

Marianne was trembling with rage, pointing at Vanessa and screaming: ""You shameless bitch! Faking photos wasn't enough‚ÄîNow you're trying to scam the Hampton family with some bastard kid?""

George walked over to me with a dark expression and patted my shoulder: ""Joanna, don't worry. From today, you'll inherit everything the Hampton family owns.""

He cast a cold glance at Vanessa. ""As for those who don't know their place, they won't see a single penny!""

Hearing George say he would leave all the Hampton assets to me, Vanessa panicked: ""No! Nicholas promised me! He said as long as I got pregnant, I'd become Mrs. Hampton, and everything would belong to my son!""

""You can't do this to me! I'm carrying the Hampton family's only heir!""

She frantically beat her own stomach: ""Open your damn eyes and see the truth! This is the Hampton family's future inheritor!""

Then she turned to me, her eyes filled with venom: ""You barren bitch, what right do you have to inherit the Hampton fortune? My son is the Hampton family's only heir!""

Suddenly, she dropped to her knees in front of George: ""Mr. Hampton, you can't be so heartless! This is your own grandson! Once the baby is born, you'll see immediately that he's a Hampton!""

As she spoke, she pulled out a stack of ultrasound photos from her purse and scattered them toward everyone: ""Look! This child's nose and eyes are identical to Nicholas's baby pictures!""

Among the ultrasound photos Vanessa had thrown, a paternity test report unexpectedly fluttered to the ground.

Marianne was quick to snatch it up.

""What's this?"" Marianne squinted, and her face suddenly went pale. ""George, look at this!""

George took the report, and there it was in black and white: ""Paternity Test Results: Fetal DNA matches Nicholas Hampton with 99.99% certainty, confirming biological relationship.""",1,1750916731.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False

1lksa0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/1lksa0q/star_trek_and_neurodivergent_representation/,Star Trek and Neurodivergent Representation,"Marked Spoiler just in case

There are a few things I want to say in this post so I'll probably break it up into a few parts. TL;DR is at the end because, but I'd prefer if you read the whole thing because 1. you're cool. and 2. I actually spent a while trying to word this all correctly lol. 

1. There are a very significant amount of neurodivergent coded characters, and specifically, autistic coded characters in Star Trek, especially compared to other media (even media that prides itself on representation often falls short on that of disability rep, I've seen). The first that come to mind for me are Data, Spock, Odo, and the Doctor. I myself am neurodivergent, and the ND-coded characters have always spoke to me. I finally had proper representation that wasn't TRYING to be good. It was just...representation. And while I think that there are definitely parts that aren't super well done, overall, the disability/ND rep is pretty awesome!
2. However, at least in the shows I've watched (TOS, TNG, most of DS9, VOY, and SNW), only one female character stands out as intentionally autistic coded and that's Seven. And, don't get me wrong, she's great representation, just like the rest, but it just annoys me. The experiences of neurodivergent women and are so vastly different from those of neurodivergent men, and there's a single character to demonstrate it? I don't know, it just...bothers me. And, as I've said, this aspect of Seven's character is awesome, we see her experiences and traits that could be attributed to neurodiverence and how they compare to the traits that characters in the show like The Doctor or even Tom have. But still, I just feel like there's so little ND women in Star Trek which just seems...unrealistic. And, yes, I know it's a sci-fi show and Voyager especially is very unrealistic but regardless, fiction has always and will always be a reflection of the real world and how we wish or don't wish it was and bla bla bla dystopia George Orwell Ray Bradbury books 1984 bla bla bla can you tell I've read a total of 1 dystopian novels and it wasn't Fahrenheit 451 (you get my point). Anyway, my point is, the concept and the plot might not need realism, but the characters and their relationships to one another do.
3. Finally, now that I've rambled I just want to tell you a character I think was a HUGE missed opportunity for ND rep.
 Janeway. I really don't know if I'm crazy but she comes off as very obviously neurodivergent. Specifically OCD, ADHD and Bipolar Disorder. The latter feels a bit more obvious I think. She is impulsive, she tends to take a like...actually insane amount of risks, she tends to make very drastic decisions without actually considering the effects (there are tons of examples but my favorite is Equinox. I also just really like that episode lol). There's points where she becomes incredibly isolated and depressed (though I guess you could just attribute that to her being thousands of light-years away from everything that she loves), and also. The coffee. That's like a ritualistic thing for her. That's more of a stereotypica
l trait of someone who js ND but it's a trait nonetheless. Unless I interpreted her coffee obsession wrong. I also think it would've been interesting to have a neurodivergent character in a position of power and see how they handle it and deal with the pressure. I think that Janeway's way of dealing with pressure is definitely explored by the show, but through the lens of a neurodivergent woman, I think it would've been much more interesting and powerful.


And thats all basically. I just thought this would be an interesting thing to discuss, even if people online are constantly talking about Star Trek and it's representation, I think (emphasis on THINK) I'm bringing a new concept to this sort of discussion. I'm curious if you guys have any characters you see as ND/ND coded that I didn't mention 

TL;DR:
Read the intro. I know you can do it.
1. Star Trek has good ND rep, but there are definitely valid criticisms. 
2. There are a surprising lack of ND women in Star Trek. Even so, Seven is a great piece of representation and contrasts well with other ND characters in Voyager. 
3. I think Janeway was a missed opportunity for ND rep.

Palate: medium body, dry again a lot of actual wood, bark, plethora of tannins giving this grapeskin and actual dry oak flavor, bad coffee, dry earth which slowly amplifies on each sip, additional hints of red and black fruit here and there.

Finish: long, very dry the tannins, wood, and earth are everywhere.

The M. Chapoutier Varonniers i just had was sweeter and better overall, here the dry oak (whisky oak) stands out. I don't have good history with Chateau Gris. Anne Krebiehl from Wine Enthusiast gave this a 94 in 2020, James Suckling gave this a 93 in 2020, Jancis Robinson gave this a 16.

I was on a vacation last week in Germany. I took off at Hannover and had a layover in Istanbul yesterday, alone.

When I was waiting the flight in Hannover, I saw a girl very gorgeous and she was alone too. I cannot help but looked at her multiple times because she was just perfect, and I felt like she looked at me multiple times as well. I do not want to be silly but at least I did not feel any hositility from her body language.

But I am a shy and stupid guy so I did not do anything at Hannover airport and just hating myself during the flight.

After the plane arrived at Istanbul, I went to the transfer gate and thought I will be regreting for life but then I saw her coming too. We were the only persons in that plane who went to the transfer gate.

She walked slowly near me, at least not escaping from me. Since we looked at each other multiple times, I thought she would not walk too close to me if she felt uncomfortable.

But I am a shy and stupid guy so I still did nothing. I did not have confidence and I did not have such experience talking to a unknown pretty girl, especially in English.

She went to STARBUCKS just besides the transfer gate. My flight was in 2 hours, and I was sleepy and needed a cup of coffee, so I went to that STARBUCKS too, considering if there is any chance I could talk to her. Just as I said I am not a native English speaker so I had to consider how to act good to her if I was going to do it.

But I am a shy and stupid guy so I did nothing untill my flight was really about to go. I even sat far from her in STARBUCKS.

Finally I packed my luggage up and walked to her. ""Would you mind talking for a while?"" Perhaps it is a stupid start for an English speaker but I was too nervous to come up with another cool one. ""What?"" she did not listen well so I said again. ""No."" she said, smiling, looking at my eyes, shaking her head very slowly.

But I was too nervous, so I was disppointed hearing that NO, and I asked, ""no?"" ""no."" she said again. I thought I was rejected so I said sorry and just walked away, toward my flight, maybe would never see this dream girl again in the rest of my life.

I was disappointed but relaxed THEN, because actually she did not want to talk, so I should not have worried about it for hours.

But the moment when I was boarding, I suddenly recalled that what I asked is ""would you mind"", and a negative answer to this question should be positive.

I am not sure if I am an asshole because I am not a native English speaker. Maybe she did mean rejection, but I am regreting I did not confirm again using another sentence like ""so you just want to be alone?"" or something else.

My friend and I (who shall remain unnamed (for fear of an angry mob tearing him to shreds), were studying in the library today. He leaned forward, his coffee breath burning off my nose hairs better than any laser hair removal service could ever hope to. He uttered the dreaded words, ""I got a B in Gen Chem."" 

Let me just say this, premed family. I nearly dropped my custom coffee mug that says, ""future podiatric neurosurgeon"" all over my custom monogrammed sweater with ""Dr \*insert my name here\* on the breast pocket!

My face became red as a tomato, and I screamed at him so loud that every window within a five-mile radius was shattered. How could he even CONVERSE with me?! I mean, a B!A B, for God's sake! My friend sank into the floor like a trash bag full of pudding and sheepishly wiped the blood away from his earlobes. It was at this point that I told him that the only possible course of action was to change one of those majors that those who are part of the premed master race (like yours truly) suck our teeth and chortle at while we sip our brandy (from our custom mugs that read ""I'm going to be a doctor, hold your applause,"" of course.)

My friend told me that getting a few B's isn't a bad thing, to which I laughed at him. I mean, I'm a rising sophomore and I already have 10 quintillion clinical hours, 5000 publications, a letter of rec from the president of the USA and the People's Republic of China, respectively, a 5.0 gpa and a 600 MCAT. \*Chuckles\* like, you're gonna have to do better than that, buddy. Maybe learn to astral project like Doctor Strange, so you can keep up with your studies, hmm..?

Yeah, that's what I thought. So anyway, he burst into tears and tried to run into traffic, but my aura as a premed (future urinary cardiologist hospital administrator doctor) stopped him from being hurt. But I'll talk to my other friends, and we're cutting him from the friend group. 

The disturbing part is that no matter how hard I scrubbed my hands, I can't get his stench of failure off of me. What should I do, premed family? Should I amputate my arm? And if I do, can I count it as clinical hours?",14,1750914939.0,premed,5,1.0,False

Also imagine if the concepts could influence the character.

Just saying that this is dripping with angst potential if the concepts can almost force the player to feel something. Even with the characters we have, imagine if Doug just touches the player and immediately they become weighed down with the dread of the world.

I‚Äôm going through a tough breakup and could really use some outside perspective. It‚Äôs been almost 7 months since we broke up, and I‚Äôm still struggling to move on. We were together for a year, and the relationship had its share of highs and lows.

Now before I tell you the story I want to say a few things. I feel that she didn't do any of this out of malice, but instead was just emotionally immature. 

I really feel that things were getting better after we had discussions. And I really loved her regardless of what I'm going to say. And I feel she really loved me too.


So here we go:

I met her at a time when she was going through a rough phase in life. She had just moved away from home to a new city and was low-key depressed. Somehow I felt we had a deep connection in some ways and instantly got attracted to her. Initially we became friends and then eventually started dating. First month was really good but then things started showing up. She started acting very differently and we fought often and misunderstood each other a lot. There were red flags early on that I saw and ignored. For instance, she asked me to choose between her and a friend she had issues with. I tried to understand her point of view and ended up cutting that friend off. Later, she asked me to stop meeting another friend who lived in the same house as the first, suggesting I meet her outside or inform her beforehand if I go to her house. But every time I went there, it led to a fight, and eventually, I stopped talking and going to her place.

There were instances where she had an issue with me going out with just my guy friends and she feeling that it was not fair and misogynistic. (Although she was okay with hanging out just with her girl friends) Eventually she got better. I tried to explain my need for space and balance, but she wasn‚Äôt very receptive. Over time, I found myself losing touch with my own life and ended up always spending time with her, running errands, helping out, doing what I could to be a good partner. Yet, I often felt neglected and criticized for even small mistakes.

I brought this up to her, told her how I was feeling unappreciated and like I was giving more than I was receiving. We had a big discussion where I told her she needs to show some gratitude, and to be fair, she did seem to try a little after that. She stopped snapping as much, and was less mean, though it still came out during fights.

But things continued to feel emotionally unstable. She sometimes accused me of using her for her body, and when I asked why she saying that?, she said it was because I wasn‚Äôt responding the way she wanted during an argument. She‚Äôd yell at me, use harsh words, and I began to feel like I was constantly walking on eggshells. I started seeking her approval for everything, trying not to set her off.

Even though I felt disrespected and neglected at times, I didn‚Äôt speak up honestly. I just swallowed those feelings to keep the peace. The thing is, she was a different person with others. She was sweet, well-liked, and surrounded by genuinely kind friends. This made me question myself, wondering if I was the one who just couldn‚Äôt understand her and was causing the tension.

I tried being there for her in all capacity: cooked, went grocery shopping, planned dates, helped her with studies, But small things were blown out of proportion. One time, she came over after work and was upset I hadn‚Äôt prepared dinner yet. Another time, I made her coffee with honey and she got mad that I didn‚Äôt know her preferences. I helped her with cooking and dishes at her place, while she often didn‚Äôt even wash her own plate at mine. I could go on, but that‚Äôs not the point. The point is that I was trying to hold space for her without letting her feel too much, but it was breaking me.

The moment that really broke me was when I fell seriously ill and had to go to the ER. I needed her the way I had been there for her when she fell sick in the past. But she was out of town. I told her what was going on, and though she did check in via text and calls, it felt just convenient, like it was on her terms. Maybe I expected too much, but I felt deeply neglected and taken for granted.

I still didn‚Äôt express much, but she sensed something was wrong and asked about it. I opened up, and she said she‚Äôd be there fully once she was back. The next day, she texted me sweet messages saying she loved me, but I was at the doctor and saw them through notifications but didn't reply right away. Four hours later, when I finally opened my phone to respond, the messages had been deleted. I called her, no response. I texted her asking what she deleted, and she replied, ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter anymore.‚Äù

That hit me hard. I didn't say anything after that. And then, she didn‚Äôt check in for three days, though she kept sending me memes on Instagram. On the third night when she was coming back, she texted me to leave her keys in my apartment‚Äôs foyer. No ‚ÄúHow are you feeling?‚Äù just instructions. That cut deep. I left the keys as she asked and sent her a photo. She replied saying someone might take them and that she‚Äôd be there in 20 minutes. When she arrived, we exchanged no words.

Later that night, she video-called me, which I didn‚Äôt pick up. I called back and said I was sleeping, let‚Äôs talk tomorrow. We didn‚Äôt talk the next day. I saw her at a shopping center while I was out getting her a birthday gift (I hadn‚Äôt been able to earlier because I was bedridden). Later, she claimed that if I was well enough to be out, I must‚Äôve been faking how sick I was. But the truth was I was still unwell.

She didn‚Äôt reach out for another week. On the 8th day, she texted, and we got into a fight. She accused me of ghosting her over unsent texts and being childish. I asked to meet in person. She said she was busy and postponed it for a few days.

By the time we met, I was emotionally drained. I ended the relationship. I even called her best friend, holding back tears, to ask them to look out for her. Whereas she texted me to collect my stuff from her place. When I said I‚Äôd send someone, she started texting me that I didn't do the right thing and eventually sending a heartfelt letter about how much I meant to her. I met her, and she apologized for not checking in while I was sick, but insisted she didn‚Äôt know I was still suffering. But I was too hurt by then.

About 15 days after the breakup, I checked in on her. She told me she didn‚Äôt want to talk and needed space, which I respected.

We both went back home for a month, and after returning, I ended up moving into the same living space as her (I had already signed the lease). We saw each other often, but I never initiated contact. She reached out once to say hi, and another time when she was sick, I asked how she was. But that was it.

Now, six months have passed. We're both about to leave this space. I reached out to her in good faith, hoping for one last conversation, not to argue or blame, but just to talk, to acknowledge what we had. She said she‚Äôd let me know. Then ghosted me.

Here‚Äôs the thing: I‚Äôve started to wonder whether I‚Äôve just been seeing things through my own lens. Maybe I could have handled the breakup more maturely. Maybe if I had communicated my feelings clearly during the relationship, things wouldn‚Äôt have ended like this. She didn‚Äôt always know how I felt. Maybe I should have given her another chance to explain herself and work things out? 

I feel that if we kept working on it it could have evolved into something great 

During my time apart I have realized a lot of things about me and I have forgiven her for everything because I feel it was not intentional. She was a good human just unaware and naive.

The weird part is, writing all this down, I still feel like I was the problem. That I didn‚Äôt communicate, didn‚Äôt stand up for myself, let my ego get in the way. A part of me still wants to go back because I genuinely valued her.

 It‚Äôs been 15 days since I reached out. I‚Äôve tried moving on these past six months, but I keep falling into the spiral of thinking maybe I wasn‚Äôt good enough. Maybe I didn‚Äôt try hard enough. Maybe I‚Äôm being unfair and failing to understand her side. And I'm missing out on a really wonderful person.

So I‚Äôm asking you folks: Please challenge my perspective. Was I wrong somewhere? Was she immature but growing, and I just didn‚Äôt give it time? Or am I just being a fool?

If you read through all of this, thank you so much for listening. I‚Äôd genuinely appreciate your thoughts. 

How do I stop feeling like I lost someone really special? Because despite everything, I love her and  still admire the person she is. And I keep wondering do I go back with accountability? Or do I finally let go? And how?",1,1750914372.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Janson 501 washed

I‚Äôll probably end up buying two out of the three

Hey RetirementReady fam! üåü 

Let‚Äôs talk about something that's probably been on all our minds‚ÄîSocial Security. I mean, who doesn‚Äôt want to wring every last drop of goodness out of those hard-earned benefits? It's like finding an extra fry at the bottom of the bag‚Äîall the more reason to celebrate! üçüüí∞

So, how do we make sure we're maximizing our benefits? AARP has some killer strategies that can help us work smarter, not harder. And trust me, a little planning now can mean a lot later. Here‚Äôs the lowdown:

- **Timing is Everything**: Did you know that if you claim too early, you might leave thousands on the table? üéØ Waiting just a few years can increase your monthly benefits significantly. Think about it; would you rather have a few extra bucks now or a nice nest egg later on?
  
- **Earn More Before You Claim**: If you're able to work a little longer, you can boost your average income. Higher lifetime earnings = higher benefits. Plus, what can we say? More time in the workforce means more chance to keep those brain cells sharp and make more friends (and coffee runs) in the office! ‚òïüë©‚Äçüíª

- **Spousal Benefits Matter**: Plan together, and don't overlook spousal benefits! Sometimes it's worth it for one partner to claim later to maximize the couple's total benefit. You‚Äôve worked hard for those together, so strategize like a power couple! üí™‚ù§Ô∏è

- **Know Your Options**: Don't just settle for the standard claiming age! There are other options like delaying benefits or even switching strategies. Mix it up a little‚Äîsocial security isn't a one-size-fits-all!

- **Plan for Life Expectancy**: Honestly, who knows how long we‚Äôll live these days? (Here‚Äôs hoping for those 100+ year celebrations!) Delaying claiming can be beneficial if you're aiming to live a long, fulfilling life.

Now, a little something to ponder: *How different will your retirement look if you took a few extra steps to claim smarter?* ü§î 

By knowing these strategies, you‚Äôre not just planning for Social Security; you‚Äôre empowering yourself to lead the lifestyle you want as you age. After all, it‚Äôs all about living life to the fullest, right? 

Oh, and speaking of empowerment, if you want more insights like this, check out [this link](https://mavely.app.link/e/TuANm4vQCSb). It‚Äôs a cool resource that can help you choose how you want to live as you age!

Just looking for some advice regarding my cockatiel. 

I‚Äôve had him almost 6 years and love him to bits and he‚Äôs the best thing to happen to me in years, but the last few years he‚Äôs become an extremely hormonal bird. Some of his behaviours include 

- constantly seeking caves or sneaking under couches etc 

- obsessed with his own shadow so I we have to often leave lights off so his shadow isnt casted on walls or floors. 

- he knows almost every location he can see himself. This include oven glass, bathroom mirror, any device screen, coffee machine etc. and flies to those locations all the time. 

-if I put him away when horny he often just spews up seeds excessively 

Some of the things we have tried doing is

-putting him away for a few hours but the minute he‚Äôs out he goes seeking again. 

- no longer allowed in the bathroom while we shower. 

-sometimes putting a towel on the cage. Also doesn‚Äôt work 

-putting him in the spare room with the door closed. 

-putting him to bed at 6pm most days even in summer so he things it‚Äôs winter. Also doesn‚Äôt work 

We don‚Äôt plan to get rid of him because we love him so much but just not sure how to get this behaviour under control. 

He wasn‚Äôt always like this and he use to sit and enjoy our company a lot more but no longer seems to.

1lkr9zm,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Classic-Event7772/comments/1lkr9zm/fort_worth_kitchen_remodeling_transforming_the/,Fort Worth Kitchen Remodeling: Transforming the Heart of Your Home,"

Kitchen remodeling is more than just a renovation‚Äîit‚Äôs a reinvention of one of the most essential spaces in a home. In Fort Worth, where style meets Southern charm, kitchen remodeling has become a top priority for homeowners looking to enhance both their home‚Äôs value and their daily living experience. Whether you're aiming to modernize a dated layout, create a more functional cooking area, or design a gathering spot that brings people together, investing in Fort Worth kitchen remodeling can breathe new life into your home.

**Why Kitchen Remodeling Matters in Fort Worth**

The kitchen is often referred to as the heart of the home, and for good reason. It‚Äôs where meals are made, memories are created, and families connect. In Fort Worth, where hospitality is a way of life, having a kitchen that reflects warmth, functionality, and style is a must. From traditional ranch-style homes to newer builds, homeowners throughout the region are turning to kitchen remodeling projects to better align their spaces with their lifestyles.

Fort Worth kitchen remodeling isn‚Äôt just about aesthetics. It also addresses practical needs like improving traffic flow, maximizing storage, enhancing lighting, and increasing energy efficiency. With the area‚Äôs diverse architectural influences and evolving design trends, there's no shortage of inspiration when it comes to creating a kitchen that blends beauty with purpose.

**Design Trends in Fort Worth Kitchen Remodeling**

Every remodeling project starts with a vision, and in Fort Worth, popular kitchen design trends reflect both timeless charm and contemporary convenience. Some of the leading trends include:

**Open Concept Layouts**  
Many homeowners in Fort Worth are opting to tear down walls and create open-concept kitchens that flow into adjacent living and dining areas. This layout encourages a more social environment and makes smaller homes feel larger and more connected.

**Natural and Earthy Tones**  
Neutral palettes with warm undertones‚Äîthink soft grays, beiges, and creamy whites‚Äîare dominating kitchen color schemes. These shades create a calming atmosphere and pair beautifully with natural wood finishes, stone countertops, and farmhouse-style d√©cor.

**Custom Cabinetry and Storage Solutions**  
Smart storage is a critical component of successful kitchen remodeling. Homeowners are increasingly seeking custom cabinetry that includes built-in organizers, pull-out shelves, deep drawers, and hidden appliances to maintain a clean, uncluttered appearance.

**Luxury Materials and Finishes**  
From quartz countertops to hardwood floors and custom backsplashes, Fort Worth kitchen remodeling projects often feature high-quality materials that elevate the look and feel of the space. Matte black hardware, brushed gold faucets, and statement lighting fixtures are common finishing touches.

**Energy Efficiency and Sustainability**  
Homeowners are more environmentally conscious than ever. Kitchen remodeling in Fort Worth frequently incorporates energy-efficient appliances, LED lighting, low-flow faucets, and sustainable materials such as bamboo flooring or reclaimed wood.

**Functional Upgrades for Better Living**

A well-designed kitchen goes beyond appearances; it enhances how you live. Here are a few popular upgrades homeowners in Fort Worth are integrating into their kitchen remodels to increase functionality:

**Improved Lighting Systems**  
Layered lighting designs are replacing old-school overhead fixtures. Ambient lighting, under-cabinet lighting, and accent lights work together to brighten up the space and highlight architectural features.

**Walk-In Pantries**  
Modern families need storage that works. A walk-in pantry provides an organized space to store dry goods, small appliances, and kitchen essentials without crowding countertops and cabinets.

**Multipurpose Kitchen Islands**  
Kitchen islands are now central hubs for cooking, dining, and even working from home. Fort Worth kitchen remodeling trends include oversized islands with integrated sinks, seating, and charging stations to meet a variety of household needs.

**Upgraded Ventilation and Plumbing**  
Older kitchens often struggle with insufficient ventilation or outdated plumbing. A remodel presents the opportunity to replace worn pipes, improve air quality with upgraded range hoods, and ensure all systems meet current codes and standards.

**The Impact on Home Value**

One of the most compelling reasons homeowners invest in Fort Worth kitchen remodeling is the positive impact on resale value. The kitchen is a focal point for prospective buyers, and a recently remodeled kitchen often serves as a major selling point. According to data from sources like Remodeling Magazine‚Äôs Cost vs. Value Report, kitchen renovations consistently rank among the top home improvements for return on investment.

Buyers are willing to pay more for a home that features updated cabinetry, modern appliances, ample storage, and stylish finishes. Even for homeowners who aren‚Äôt planning to sell immediately, a kitchen remodel provides a sense of pride and enjoyment that adds immeasurable value to daily life.

**Challenges and Considerations in Kitchen Remodeling**

While the rewards of remodeling are great, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge that kitchen remodeling is a significant undertaking. Planning is key. Before starting your project, consider the following:

**Budgeting and Prioritization**  
Set a clear budget and determine which elements are most important to you. Whether it‚Äôs high-end appliances, custom cabinets, or imported tiles, knowing your priorities will help you allocate funds effectively.

**Timeline and Disruption**  
A full kitchen remodel can take weeks or even months, depending on the scope. Prepare for temporary inconvenience by setting up an alternative cooking area and minimizing disruption to your household.

**Design Cohesion with the Rest of the Home**  
While you may be tempted to go bold with your kitchen design, ensure it complements the style and flow of the rest of your home. A cohesive aesthetic improves the overall impression of your space and maintains visual harmony.

**Code Compliance and Permits**  
Kitchen remodeling projects that involve plumbing, electrical work, or structural changes often require permits. Make sure everything complies with local building codes to avoid costly delays or fines.

**Creating a Timeless Design**

While trends come and go, a timeless kitchen design will always hold its appeal. Classic elements like subway tile backsplashes, shaker-style cabinets, neutral color schemes, and natural stone countertops offer enduring beauty. When planning your Fort Worth kitchen remodeling project, consider mixing trendy elements with timeless foundations to create a space that feels both current and everlasting.

This approach allows for easier updates in the future. For example, bold cabinet colors or trendy hardware can be changed out without overhauling the entire space, saving money while keeping your kitchen fresh.

**Conclusion: Elevate Your Home with Fort Worth Kitchen Remodeling**

If your kitchen feels outdated, cramped, or simply no longer serves your needs, it might be time to reimagine what‚Äôs possible. Fort Worth kitchen remodeling gives you the chance to transform your space into something that supports your lifestyle, reflects your taste, and adds long-term value to your home. Whether you're entertaining guests, preparing meals, or enjoying quiet mornings with a cup of coffee, the right kitchen design can make all the difference.

A thoughtfully remodeled kitchen invites joy, connection, and efficiency into your daily life. From layout and lighting to materials and color palette, every choice plays a role in creating a space that truly feels like the heart of your home. So if you're ready to take the next step, start dreaming, start planning‚Äîand start cooking up something amazing.

I know game developers are supposed to contact before promoting anything, but I‚Äôm just here to ask for some opinions and get some outside perspective.

So as stated above, if anybody actually sees this post, I want some opinions. I‚Äôve already detailed out a good portion of the ‚Äústory‚Äù to the game, involving you as the MC purchasing a store in a fictional city to develop a business as a fashion designer / consultant. I like the idea of you settling into the community over time, and I‚Äôm thinking of even adding in some romanceable NPCs. I don‚Äôt want to say too much right now, but that‚Äôs the gist of it. Now I‚Äôm looking into mechanics and playstyle. Those of you who have been wanting a fashion game, what kind of playstyles would you like to see?

I have three main ideas for this. 

The first one, best way I can think to put it is something like ‚ÄúCoffee Talk‚Äù or ‚ÄúGood Pizza, Great Pizza.‚Äù You have a customer come into the shop with a request, and you fulfill it, unlocking more options as time goes on. This would make the storyline very linear, and I almost fear that it could get boring this way? But I also feel like I could figure out a way to keep it interesting, I don‚Äôt know.

The second way I was thinking is a bit more in the style of ‚ÄúPotion Permit‚Äù or ‚ÄúWytchwood.‚Äù Obviously this would be in a more urban setting, but I thought it would be cute to have a little bit of world exploration. I wouldn‚Äôt want to make the game too grindy, because it would be a fashion game first, but I thought it would be cute to find a way to have the player actually crafting clothing items. This could even be through a side scroller instead, but I‚Äôm not too positive on how detailed this would get.

The final way is in a style similar to ‚ÄúWitchy Life Story‚Äù or even ‚ÄúMonster Prom.‚Äù So more of a visual novel style that gives you the ability to visit multiple locations for things such as material gathering or relationship developing with NPCs. This is the one I‚Äôm leaning towards the most, because I think it would be a good blend of the two and a bit less complicated to make.

His bride was found dead in the chapel, her throat slashed with a gruesome wound, her limbs grotesquely twisted. Every security camera was reviewed, but the footage clearly showed no one had entered the chapel that night except the bride herself....","Chapter 1  
  
All of Manhattan knew about the PECULIAR TRADITION in the Forrester family, New York's wealthiest dynasty‚ÄîEvery new bride had to spend her wedding night alone in the family chapel, praying until dawn. Only those who emerged unharmed the next morning were considered blessed by the Forrester ancestors.  
  
What once had been just a formality turned into a nightmare when Callum Forrester, the current heir, took a bride.  
  
His bride was found dead in the chapel, her throat slashed with a gruesome wound, her limbs grotesquely twisted.  
  
Every security camera was reviewed, but the footage clearly showed no one had entered the chapel that night except the bride herself.  
  
Later, Callum married seven more times over the years, and horrifyingly, each bride met the same fate on her wedding night in that chapel.  
  
Police investigations yielded nothing conclusive, and each death was eventually ruled a suicide.  
  
Rumors spread throughout Manhattan‚Äîsome claimed the Forrester estate was haunted, others whispered about dark rituals. No family would risk sending their daughter there anymore.  
  
But today, I stood before Mrs. Forrester in a crimson dress, my posture graceful yet determined.  
  
""Mr. Forrester is exceptionally handsome,"" I said. ""I've admired him from afar for years. I'm willing to be his ninth wife.""  
  
I looked her directly in the eyes. ""Don't worry. Your ancestors may not have liked the others, but they'll certainly like me.""  
  
\---  
  
My family ran a small bakery on York Avenue.  
  
Before dawn each morning, my sister would help our parents with the work‚Äîkneading dough, preparing fillings, making pastries, brewing coffee. She excelled at everything and never let me help.  
  
""Melody, you're meant for academics,"" she would say. ""Just focus on your studies.""  
  
""We'll support you all the way to success!""  
  
Eight years ago, on the day I was announced as Manhattan's valedictorian.  
  
My sister, dressed in a pristine white gown, shyly boarded the luxurious wedding car sent by the Forrester family.  
  
Everyone envied her good fortune. While serving coffee one morning, she had somehow caught the eye of Callum Forrester, heir to the family fortune, and was now marrying into wealth and privilege.  
  
I was happy for her too, not because of the Forrester fortune, but because of the shy, joyful look on her face before she left:  
  
""Melody, don't worry about me. Callum is truly kind, and his family has been welcoming,"" she said, holding my hands. ""I need to fly higher so you can go further. You'll always be the sister I'll protect with everything I have!""  
  
That night, I dreamed my sister had a beautiful baby who called me ""Auntie"" in the sweetest voice while clutching my shirt.  
  
But the next morning, the shocking news of my sister's death shattered our world.  
  
I raced to the Forrester estate, arriving just as they carried her out on a crude stretcher.  
  
My sister's once delicate hands were now bruised and gray. Her fingertips were bloody, all ten nails forcibly torn off, the flesh raw and mangled.  
  
Despite everyone's attempts to stop me, I yanked back the sheet covering her.  
  
Her death was horrifying‚Äîa gaping wound across her throat, her body twisted unnaturally, her eyes bulging like a fish's.  
  
Her pristine white gown was soaked through with blood, a pool of it staining the stretcher beneath her.  
  
I felt the world spinning as I collapsed to the ground.  
  
But then I heard my father's sickeningly servile tone as he kowtowed to Callum.  
  
""This terrible incident must be Victoria's fault‚Äîshe simply wasn't worthy of the Forrester ancestors' blessing.""  
  
""Mr. Forrester, you're young and successful. You'll definitely find a much better wife in the future. Please don't waste your grief on someone so worthless!""  
  
Though we weren't wealthy, my father had always been kind to us sisters, never speaking harshly to either of us.  
  
When relatives once mocked him for having ""worthless daughters,"" he had grabbed a kitchen knife and confronted them.  
  
Now I couldn't believe these words were coming from his mouth.  
  
""Who would've thought I'd marry a mental case? Killing herself in the chapel on our wedding day‚Äîwhat terrible luck!""  
  
""Get rid of her quickly. The sight is giving me a headache.""  
  
Callum's face was dark with annoyance, showing no grief or pain as he turned to leave.  
  
My sister treasured life above all else and had promised to protect me forever‚Äîhow could she possibly have committed suicide?!  
  
Red-eyed, I moved to confront them, only to be struck hard across the face by my father.  
  
""It's your sister's fault for not being fortunate enough to marry into such a good family!""  
  
""Stop embarrassing yourself and come home with me now!""  
  
I saw stars from the impact as my father dragged me away amid the whispers and stares of onlookers.  
  
The incident caused an uproar throughout Manhattan, prompting a special investigation team from the state.  
  
Shockingly, the conclusion matched Callum's claim‚Äîmy sister had committed suicide.  
  
The Forrester estate had stringent security, and all surveillance footage was perfectly preserved. The recordings clearly showed that after my sister entered the chapel, no one else went in. The audio recordings captured even the sound of mosquitoes flying but recorded no screams.  
  
**Chapter 2**  
  
Outside the chapel doors and windows, everything remained peaceful until the next morning when Callum and his mother opened the door and discovered my sister's body.  
  
The medical examiner carefully checked every suspicious detail and ruled out homicide.  
  
Everyone calmly accepted this conclusion‚Äîeveryone except me.  
  
After spending the summer break crying, I enrolled at Princeton University as planned.  
  
Not because I cared about my future, but because it had been my sister's greatest wish for me.  
  
I abandoned the popular finance major and instead chose the obscure field of criminal investigation.  
  
After completing my undergraduate studies, I continued with a combined master's and doctoral program. I studied harder than anyone, terrified of missing any knowledge that might help me solve the mystery of my sister's death.  
  
Eight years later, I returned to Manhattan again.  
  
Much had happened with the Forrester family during my absence. After my sister, Callum had married seven more wives.  
  
These seven women came from vastly different backgrounds, with varied appearances and personalities.  
  
Yet each bride had died by apparent suicide in the family chapel on her wedding night.  
  
Particularly noteworthy was the eighth wife, married just six months ago‚ÄîDarla Thompson, a butcher's daughter from the marketplace. She weighed nearly 300 pounds and was strong enough to knock out a grown man with one punch, with a notoriously volatile temper.  
  
Her father had gambling debts of $500,000, and the Forresters, desperate for a bride, had promised her $20 million in cash and ten commercial properties in Marina City if she survived the night.  
  
Darla tried‚Äîbut didn't make it out alive.  
  
Callum had attempted to persuade his family to abandon the chapel ritual, but Mrs. Forrester insisted it was a tradition passed down through generations that could not be broken.  
  
This led to rumors spreading throughout Manhattan‚Äîsome said the Forrester estate was haunted by malevolent spirits determined to end the family line; others whispered that the Forresters were sacrificing brides to feed otherworldly beings in exchange for their incredible wealth.  
  
Whatever the truth, no family across the country was willing to send their daughter there anymore.  
  
Yet on my second day back in Manhattan, I dressed in a striking crimson dress, applied flawless makeup, and appeared at the Forrester estate's entrance.  
  
""Tell your mistress I'm willing to be Callum Forrester's ninth wife.""  
  
News of my request to marry Callum spread through Manhattan like wildfire.  
  
Though Manhattan wasn't small, gossip traveled faster than any virus.  
  
""I heard Melody Vincent just returned yesterday and is already offering to marry Callum Forrester. Both sisters are just gold-diggers!""  
  
""Poor Mr. Vincent‚Äîhe used to brag about how brilliant his daughter was, but look at her now, falling at the feet of money just like her sister.""  
  
""Money aside, those Forrester rumors should give anyone pause. Looks like the Vincent family might lose both daughters to that cursed place!""  
  
Everyone in Manhattan branded me as a shallow gold-digger.  
  
The fact that I was a Princeton graduate with a doctorate made the contrast all the more shocking and thrilling to them.  
  
Inside the Forrester estate, Mrs. Forrester had me brought to her.  
  
""Melody Vincent, do you truly want to marry my son?"" she asked, studying me with interest.  
  
""More certain than gold is pure!"" I replied with a smile.  
  
""Everyone knows Mr. Forrester is refined, gentle, and friendly‚Äînot to mention his net worth recently surpassed ten billion. What reason could I possibly have not to like him?""  
  
Mrs. Forrester responded with a cold laugh.  
  
""I knew you couldn't genuinely care for Callum!""  
  
The disgust in her eyes was unmistakable.  
  
But I knew she had no choice.  
  
""Look, I'm not gonna beat around the bush,"" she said.  
  
""You haven't forgotten what happened to your sister in our family chapel eight years ago, have you?""  
  
""During the eight years you've been away, a new bride has died in that chapel each year. What makes you think you'll live longer than they did?""  
  
**Chapter 3**  
  
Mrs. Forrester's piercing gaze fixed on me.  
  
I smiled faintly.  
  
""Don't worry, Mrs. Forrester. I'm different from those ordinary women. Your ancestors may not have liked them, but they'll certainly approve of me!""  
  
I stared back at her with proud confidence.  
  
She studied me for a long time before finally nodding in agreement.  
  
""Go prepare yourself. Only by surviving tonight can you prove you're different from the others!""  
  
She dismissed me with a wave.  
  
I smiled, knowing all truths would be revealed tonight!  
  
When I returned home, my parents were already waiting.  
  
""What madness is this? Who gave you permission to agree to marry Callum Forrester?!"" My father's face was flushed with anger.  
  
My mother anxiously wiped away tears, her eyes filled with sorrow as she looked at me.  
  
But as I faced my father, I felt nothing.  
  
""Since when have you cared who I marry?"" I asked, staring into his eyes.  
  
""What nonsense! Why wouldn't I care? Don't you know about the Forrester rumors? Going there is practically suicide! Are you trying to put me and your mother in an early grave?""  
  
My father desperately tried to make me see reason.  
  
But I only coldly asked: ""If you truly cared, you wouldn't have let Victoria die in vain back then.""  
  
My father's entire body trembled, his lips quivering.  
  
""Melody, don't speak to your father like that. Your father‚Ä¶"" my mother began.  
  
""Shut up!"" he snapped harshly when my mother tried to defend him.  
  
Then he glared at me intensely.  
  
""Fine, since you've made your decision, I won't interfere anymore.""  
  
""From this day forward, you are no longer my daughter!""  
  
My father drove me from the house despite my mother's desperate pleas, but he remained unmoved.  
  
After leaving, I bowed deeply toward my parents' home.  
  
""Dad, Mom, your daughter has been unfilial.""  
  
""If I can uncover the truth, I promise I'll return to care for you properly!""  
  
I whispered before turning toward the end of the alley.  
  
Callum's wedding procession was even more extravagant than eight years ago‚Äîa line of Rolls-Royces that anyone would envy.  
  
""Well, that's it for the Vincent family line!""  
  
""All those years of fancy education, and that Princeton doctorate isn't worth squat, is it?""  
  
The neighbors lining the alley had all come out to mock me with their cruel taunts.  
  
Yet I boarded the car without hesitation.  
  
The procession moved slowly, taking half an hour to reach the vicinity of the Forrester family chapel.  
  
But when we were still about five hundred yards from the chapel, the driver refused to go any further.  
  
""Miss Vincent, may God be with you. We wouldn't go near that place even if you killed us,"" the driver said, turning to me.  
  
I nodded slightly, then got out and looked ahead.  
  
Perhaps it was the poor weather, or perhaps the area truly was heavy with malevolent energy, but the summer night suddenly felt bone-chillingly cold.  
  
The dark alley ahead resembled a path to hell, yet I walked forward with determined steps.  
  
A few minutes later, I stood before the Forrester family chapel.  
  
The door creaked open, and Mrs. Forrester stood in the entrance beckoning to me.  
  
Perhaps it was her overly pale makeup, but I couldn't shake the impression she resembled a paper effigy.  
  
Mrs. Forrester thrust a prayer book into my hands.  
  
""Go. Recite the prayers,"" she instructed coldly.  
  
""Read them through once, then again. I advise you not to fall asleep‚Äîotherwise... well, who knows what might happen.""  
  
Her eyes held a strange mixture of contempt and pity as she looked at me.  
  
Beside her, Callum emerged from the chapel with several others.  
  
He glanced at me dismissively.  
  
""Your sister was much prettier than you, but it doesn't matter now. I'd marry a pig if it survived the night!""  
  
Callum's face was filled with arrogance.  
  
I silently clenched my fists.  
  
I remained convinced that Callum had done something to my sister!  
  
Now my enemy stood before me, yet I could do nothing‚Äîthe frustration was unbearable.  
  
""May I enter now?"" I asked, looking at Mrs. Forrester.  
  
She didn't speak, merely gesturing for someone to open the inner doors of the chapel.  
  
I walked step by step toward the unknown abyss, my heart growing heavier with each step.  
  
The door slowly closed behind me.  
  
As the last sliver of light disappeared, I found myself in complete darkness.  
  
Whoosh!  
  
Suddenly, candles on the walls ignited, their flickering light making everything around me seem eerily distorted.  
  
My heart raced involuntarily, especially when I first glimpsed the portraits of Forrester ancestors on the walls‚Äîmy fear reached its peak.  
  
Ahead, memorial tablets were arranged neatly, with a prayer mat placed on the floor.  
  
I took a deep breath, gathering my courage to approach, kneeling on the mat.  
  
Then I opened the prayer book, trying to calm myself.  
  
But just as I prepared to begin reciting, something suddenly occurred to me.  
  
""Let me out! Let me out right now!""  
  
""I know what's happening!""  
  
""I know why all those brides died mysteriously!""

Top Picks:

1. 1 Million EDT ‚Äì This is the best scent profile I‚Äôve ever tried. It has good longevity and decent projection. While the projection isn‚Äôt outstanding, the scent itself is truly impressive.

2. Afnan Supremacy CE ‚Äì Opens with smoky vibes and dries down nicely. It didn‚Äôt live up to the hype I saw in reviews, but it still does the job and feels classy.

3. Rasasi Hawas ‚Äì Some people might think it‚Äôs overrated, but after trying many other perfumes, I realize Hawas is actually quite good. It‚Äôs a great value-for-money fragrance.

Mid Tier:

1. Kayan Classic & Cammero Homme Intense ‚Äì These two smell quite similar, though I personally prefer Cammero. It‚Äôs slightly better and also more budget-friendly.

2. Bleu de Chanel ‚Äì A sophisticated office scent. I placed it in the mid-tier because although it smells refined, it‚Äôs overpriced for a fragrance with such a common DNA.

3. Versace Eros ‚Äì The scent profile is nice and bold. Some people compare it to ""Godfather"" (the local scent), which can be disappointing given its price point.

4. Club de Nuit Intense Man Pure Parfum (CDIM PP) ‚Äì Starts with a smoky pineapple vibe. I personally didn‚Äôt enjoy it much, though it‚Äôs popular with others, so I‚Äôm placing it in the middle.

Not So Impressive:

1. Azzaro The Most Wanted ‚Äì It‚Äôs not bad, but very easy to replicate. I own a clone that smells almost identical. Despite its fame, it‚Äôs pricey, and for that reason, I rate it lower.

2. Lattafa Asad ‚Äì Initially, I liked it, but the scent is very spicy‚Äîalmost like ""dant manjan"" (herbal tooth powder). It‚Äôs not a mood-lifting fragrance and not universally appealing.

3. Afnan 9PM ‚Äì Despite the hype, I found it pretty average. It opens with a fruity vanilla scent, but it doesn‚Äôt really catch people‚Äôs attention. The dry-down is better, though.

4. Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa ‚Äì Too dense for Indian weather. It's sweet with a strong coffee note, but feels more suitable for women. It‚Äôs a bit overwhelming.

Final Note:

So far, I haven‚Äôt found a perfume that truly stands out for me. My first buy was Gucci Flora (can‚Äôt recall the exact version), and it was amazing. Everything after that was just okay or disappointing. I often had to apply a lot just to get a mild scent, and still, people said they couldn‚Äôt smell anything on me. I think the Indian climate plays a big role‚Äîfragrances don‚Äôt last long here.
I‚Äôm still on the hunt for that one perfect scent that will uplift my mood and make a noticeable impact. The journey continues.

31f, 5'6"" 123lbs. No drugs, meds or drinking. 

I'm going to start at the beginning. 

*Feb 2025*
- Sudden pain in mid back, different from my usual low back pin. Both arms became numb from shoulder down, lasted a few minutes. 45-50 minutes later numbness returned and lasted all evening until sometime in the night (woke up and it was gone) 
- increased urination and feeling of need to go with either small amount coming out again or sometimes nothing coming out.

I figured I'd pinched a nerve in my back and went to my GP. I work a physical labour job and wanted to be sure I was physically sound to continue. My dr told me she does not think it is a physical ""pinch"" or anything, that she suspects neurological reasons. She mentioned MS and said I was the average age for diagnosis. She said it is too early for MRI so to wait until red flag symptoms (eye pain that does not get better, bowel incontinence, numbness that lasts for days). 

- Around Feb until now have been EXYREMELY tired. 

- weight loss since Feb 136lbs to 123lbs, less interest in food. 

- very sensitive to heat this year, few hours out in the sun is causing me to have heat exhaustion/stroke symptoms quickly out of relation to others around me. 

*Sunday June 22 2025*

- was at my sons soccer tournament, it was hot but I was in shade. Suddenly partway through his game a part (or maybe full vision I was too flustered to close each eye independently and check). When I looked at his face, I only saw half. When I held both hands up I could not see my right hand. I could not see right hand when on phone, half the letters disappeared until left eye glazed over them. Lasted 30-40minutes and then turned into erratic waves in that eye. Wind came due to a storm and the eye issue went away. No migraine symptoms like pain or nausea. No sensitivity to light. 

*Tuesday June 24, 2025*

- began urinating between 3-30 minutes. Strong urges to go. No pain or burning. 

By 11am I went into walk in and got urine test and swab. Dipstick urine came back clear but was sent off for further testing. Will hear back tomorrow or Friday. By 1:45pm I was tracking how often I was going pee. I will include tracking info in a comment. From 1:45-10:05 was 21 times. 

Today I had a optometrist appointment due to the eye issue. Nothing showed on eye and dr exclaimed she thinks it was neurological. She asked about any other symptoms and I described what I am laying out now. She said I need to push for imaging and I should try to move my appointment up (it is on July 4).

I called my dr clinic and asked to move my appointment but they are totally full she asked my symptoms and I explained and she said I should consider ER visit. I did not go to ER as I don't feel like I am in danger currently or an actual emergency. 

Today from 7:34am to now (9:26pm) I have gone 32 times. 

This is NOT happening when I sleep - I can sleep through night as normal. But waking hour have been hell. Today I even had leakage without even noticing and have now been wearing pads. 

I have no idea what to do.

Just a quick update ‚Äî this offer is only valid for a few more days, and after that, the discounts will be reduced significantly or return to the original cost.

Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of the current Coursera Plus deals by region:

* [Global ‚Äì 50% Off](https://imp.i384100.net/c/3542565/3057183/14726)¬†‚Üí Pay¬†$199¬†for 1 year

I‚Äôve been using Coursera Plus for over a year now, and trust me ‚Äî it‚Äôs absolutely worth it, especially with these current discounts where you're saving up to $200.

Think about it: for just $199, you get unlimited access to most Professional Certificates and Specializations for a whole year ‚Äî many of which typically cost **$49/month** individually.

But it‚Äôs not just about saving money. Coursera Plus comes with additional perks I‚Äôve personally experienced:

**1. Easily Switch Between Programs**

This is one of the best benefits. If you start a program (say, the Google Cybersecurity Certificate) and find it too basic, you can easily switch to another one (like the IBM Cybersecurity Analyst program) without paying extra ‚Äî something you can't do when buying a single course.

**2. Wide Variety of Courses**

Coursera covers a wide range of subjects ‚Äî business, computer science, data science, humanities, engineering, and more. This allows you to explore new interests or grow in your current field.

Whether you're aiming to grow your career, pick up in-demand skills, or just explore something new, Coursera Plus is a smart investment.

These deals are live for a few more days, so if it aligns with your goals, don‚Äôt wait too long.

It‚Äôs one of the best chances to level up your learning and earn multiple certificates over the next 12 months.

Happy Learning :)

1lkqurh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1lkqurh/the_black_eyes/,The Black Eyes,"I have had trouble connecting with people for a long time. I was autistic in the early 2000s in Texas. The understanding of autism back then wasn‚Äôt as bad as it used to be, but it‚Äôs still laughably inept when compared to today. My elementary school principal forced me to be on medication for me to be allowed to attend school. We went through a handful of medications, almost all of which left me in some kind of zombified state. I guess that was a good result for my principal, whose method of dealing with autistic kids was to throw them in a corner and ignore them. However, it didn‚Äôt work for my mom, who fought tooth and nail for me to be allowed to go to school unmedicated. I was autistic, but I had it to a minor degree. However, my principal insisted I had to be on some kind of medication, hence why we went through so many. The final medicine I was on was some experimental thing. I don‚Äôt remember much about what I was like on that medicine, I just remember it caused me a major seizure that led to a week-long coma. The principal was fired shortly after that.

Now, before anyone gets the wrong idea: my autism isn‚Äôt why I have a hard time connecting with people. Sure, it didn‚Äôt help, but I know people who adjust quite well. No, what made it hard for me was that since the seizure, I can no longer see people‚Äôs eyes.

More accurately, I only see black voids where people‚Äôs eyes should be. I don‚Äôt even see my own eyes when I look in the mirror. Since I woke up from my coma, people were no longer human. All I saw were demons. I wasn‚Äôt great with eye-contact even before the seizure, but after I was actively avoiding it at all costs. My parents sent me to a therapist to try and figure out why I was so jumpy. Being locked in a room for an hour every week with a black-eyed monster staring me down and pretending to care left a mental scar on my emotional development. I never spoke a word during these meetings. I know my parents were just trying to help. This is the first time I‚Äôm telling anyone about my condition.

When I turned 19, I met a woman named Kenzie. For the first time since I was a child, I could see someone‚Äôs eyes. Kenzie‚Äôs were a beautiful golden hazel color, which accented her beautiful smile. We met at my first job. I was a dishwasher, and she was a waitress. She had a fiery personality and argued with the cooks a lot. However, she was very kind to me. She would thank me every time she would bring me an empty stack of plates. I was smitten with her. Whenever she shot that hypnotic smile my way, I would fall more and more in love.

It took almost six months for me to work up the courage to ask her on a date. To my absolute surprise, she accepted. During the lead up to our date, I had convinced myself that she didn‚Äôt think of this as a date, that we were just going out as friends. However, I was quickly proven wrong when I saw how she dressed for our outing. She wore fishnets, a short black dress, and combat books. Her make-up was flawless, her lips were painted a glossy pink, and her gorgeous eyes were surrounded in lavender eye-shadow and glitter. Her black hair, which she normally wore in a ponytail for work, was worn loose and cascaded down her shoulders.

She took my arm, holding me close. She was so warm. I forgot what I had planned for a bit. I remembered I was supposed to take her to see a movie. It was my mom‚Äôs suggestion. We went to see Avengers. I remember how much she was squealing during that scene Avengers assembled, and the camera circled around the group while the music swelled dramatically. I wish I could have enjoyed it as much as she did. I tried to match her enthusiasm, but I found it tricky. All the people on camera just looked like monsters to me. The only character I could connect with was Hulk. All the characters looked like monsters given my condition, but Hulk was a monster already so it ironically looked less terrifying from him. I guess that‚Äôs why I like the Hellraiser movies so much. The monsters look like monsters, so the eyes look normal for them.

After the movie, I took Kenzie home. She gave me my first kiss. I swear, my heart could have burst out of my chest when it happened. I could taste her lipstick for about an hour after the kiss, which turned out to be bubblegum. I found myself staring into her hazel eyes, basking in the intimate aura. This was something I never thought I would feel comfortable doing.

We dated for a few years before marrying in our mid-twenties. The service was small, with just our immediate family attending. On my side were my parents and my little brother, who was my best man. I honestly half-considered inviting no one. My condition had made my relationship with my family rather strained. On Kenzie‚Äôs side was just her older sister, who showed up to the event in ratty, smelly clothes. It looked like she hadn‚Äôt bathed in a while. During the afterparty, her sister seemed to spend most of the time at the buffet just scarfing down whatever she could, and pocketing everything else. I don‚Äôt remember Kenzie talking to her sister at any point except for shortly before she left.

We went to a small bed and breakfast for our honeymoon. I asked Kenzie about her sister. She explained her sister had some issues with drugs and was living on the streets. Kenzie stayed with my parents until she and I were able to find our own place. It was a rent-to-own house, two stories, with a nice back yard. It seemed way out of budget for the two of us, but Kenzie insisted she had it taken care of. Indeed, we never seemed to be late on our rent, and we never went hungry.

Every month, Kenzie would leave to visit her folks. It left me with some time to myself. I did enjoy some alone time, but I missed her dearly whenever she left. I asked how come she didn‚Äôt take me with her. To my shock, her lips went thin and her eyes twitched. She seemed positively livid for a split second before returning to her normal self. It was so bizarre. It was like she was an entirely different person. She told me that her parents were old fashioned and would hate my guts. That was enough for me. Besides, they would probably freak me out with their lack of eyes. Still, it was very odd so see Kenzie so angry, even if it was only for a short time. I hate to admit it, but I was rather scared of my wife.

Over the course of a few years, I noticed something strange. Once in a while I would see Kenzie just sitting on the couch staring at nothing. It would only last for a few moments at a time, but it sent chills down my spine, for when she spaced out like this, her eyes were voids just like everyone else. The most recent time I saw this happen, I tried approaching her. She looked up as I stepped forward. She scampered away like a frightened animal, locking herself in the bedroom. She came out a few moments later apologizing profusely. After this, she would spend an hour at night locked in the bedroom. Sometimes I could hear crying on the other end of the door.

For the longest time I thought this was normal. Afterall, given my condition, Kenzie was pretty much the only one who I could talk to. However, I started to feel like something was wrong. I tried doing my own research online about what was going on with Kenzie. I couldn‚Äôt find much about what could be the matter with the woman I loved. I wanted to help her, I wanted to make the hurt go away. I got the idea in my head that maybe something going on with her parents was what was wrong with her.

I know now what I did next was wrong. I‚Äôve talked to people about it since then and they‚Äôve explained what I did was honestly kind of messed up. However, I didn‚Äôt see it like that at the time. I hid a burner phone in her car when she went to visit her parents and used the GPS tracker to see where she went. I had an external battery pack on it so it wouldn‚Äôt run out of juice. I wanted to see where her parents lived so I could confront them on my own. I recognize now that this was an invasion of privacy. I wasn‚Äôt thinking about it like that. I just saw it as the next logical step.

She drove for a while. She was usually gone for a week at a time, and she spent the whole first day driving. They must have lived a long way away. That must have been why they didn‚Äôt attend our wedding. While she drove, I tried my best to find her sister online. I thought that maybe she would have some insights about what was happening with Kenzie. I know she was homeless, but I figured she may have used the computers at a library somewhere to maybe use social media, or try and find a job.

I realized I never got her sister‚Äôs name. I tried checking anyone who shared Kenzie‚Äôs maiden name, but couldn‚Äôt find her sister. Then again, the picture on her social media would probably be old and most likely before she became homeless so I wouldn‚Äôt recognize her. I checked a few women with the same last name, but none of them listed Kenzie as a sister. I gave up after searching online all day.

That night, I checked the GPS. To my surprise, the car was stopped by some woods. I searched online to see if there was a hotel or a retirement home out there. There was nothing. I watched as for three days the car remained stationary. I wondered if perhaps her parents were like those weird hermits who live off the grid you sometimes hear about. I thought about them living out there in a cabin and living off the land. It sounded a bit cool, but was not something I would want to do. Still, I had a destination.

Since Kenzie took care of the essentials, I had a fair bit of money saved up, even with my low-paying dishwashing job. I bought a ticket to some horror movie convention out of state. It was something I wanted to go to anyways and it gave me an excuse to leave the house alone when Kenzie came back. It was on the way and I planned on actually going so it wasn‚Äôt exactly lying, I was just leaving out the main reason I was heading out. She was a bit upset that I didn‚Äôt want to bring her along, but I told her I just wanted some time to myself. I promised her I would bring her along to the next convention. She was happy with that and began planning out what costume she would wear to it.

I packed my stuff and headed out, taking the route Kenzie had taken. I packed some hiking boots, some glow sticks and a flashlight. I didn‚Äôt imagine I would be at her parent‚Äôs house for very long. I had to figure out what was going on with Kenzie, I just hoped talking to them would help me along with that. I shuddered at the thought of their black eyes staring me down, but I continued regardless.

I reached the woods at about midnight. I had just gotten off the phone with Kenzie. She wanted to check up on me. I noticed a choked note in her voice as if she had just finished crying. I felt a knot in my stomach when I heard it. Part of me wondered if she was crying because of me. I know how much I missed her when she was gone, perhaps she was feeling the same for me. That made me anxious. I squirmed a bit in my seat as we spoke. I promised I would be back soon.

I stepped out of the car, shining the light around the trees. They looked pretty normal, so I wasn‚Äôt worried. They were just trees after all. As I delved further into the woods, I dropped glow sticks so that I could find my way back like Hansel and Gretel. I kept practicing what I would say when I reached my destination. I didn‚Äôt know where exactly this house would be. I just hoped the old man wouldn‚Äôt try shooting at me, or if he did then he would stop when he heard who I was. I kept an eye out for traps. I heard weird loners would keep traps to alert them of intruders. As expected, I found a trip wire hooked up to a contraption that would make a loud noise if I stepped on it. Maybe it would be a good idea for them to find me rather than the other way around.

I examined the trap a bit closer, checking to see if there was something that would shoot me if I stepped on it. Nope, it looked totally normal. I kneeled down, and yanked on the cord. The trap made a loud bang that echoed throughout the woods. My ears rang, I had forgotten to cover them in my stupidity. I just stood there and waited. I would call out as soon as I heard movement. I leaned against a tree, shining my flashlight upwards so they would see me easier. My heart raced as I waited, worried about meeting these people.

Every second felt like an hour. I kept checking the time on my phone. Ten minutes passed. I wondered if that loud noise didn‚Äôt wake them. I didn‚Äôt know how old they were, or how heavy of sleepers they were. I frankly knew nothing about them. I called out as loud as I could, trying to catch their attention. Still though, I got nothing. I decided to venture further in. I kept calling out as I walked, trying not to set off any other traps. I kept an ear out for any response.

Eventually, I reached a small hut. It looked rather rickety, and poorly taken care of. It smelled awful. I wondered if the place was partly put together with dung, I know some places used that as a legit building material. I doubted any inspectors would approve of this place. The house was surrounded by a wire fence with wooden posts. The posts were covered in fungus and looked rotten. As I drew closer, I smelled a lot of rust. Surely these people would have woken up by now. I was a flashlight right at their house. They had to have been awake by now. I called out. There was no response.

I knocked on the door. I was wondering if the place was abandoned. However, I didn‚Äôt know what Kenzie would be doing out here if that was the case. I shone the flashlight into a cracked window of the hut. All I could see was broken furniture and cobwebs. It didn‚Äôt look like anyone lived here. However, it did look like someone was here recently. There were clear spots in the dust on the floor and some of the cobwebs were hanging loose as if they had been pulled out of someone‚Äôs way. My mind was racing, wondering just what Kenzie did out here. The traps were maintained rather well. If no one lived out here, that meant Kenzie had to have been the one dealing with the traps.

I half considered going inside to explore. However, I didn‚Äôt really want Kenzie knowing I was here. A single trap going off could be explained by either mechanical failure or an animal. However, me going in there would definitely leave some signs someone was here. Perhaps she would think her sister was here, she was homeless after all. This would be a convenient place to sleep. I was just about to move to the door to open it when I saw something that made my stomach sink. There was blood on the floor. It looked like a smear mark, like something had been dragged. I followed the smear with my flashlight. The smear ended suddenly at what I assumed was a trap door. I could see a rusted handle.

I rushed to the car and called the police. I told them what hotel I would be going to and waited for an officer to meet me there. From the hotel I was taken to a police station to answer questions. They didn‚Äôt tell me what was going on, but they seemed deadly serious. I told them everything, including the admittedly creepy part where I tracked my wife. I would have made up something to cover up that part but I couldn‚Äôt think of a reasonable excuse as to how I knew about the hut.

They left me in the interrogation room for a few hours until one of the officers sat across from me to explain what was going on. There were several corpses under the trap door, all of which had human bite marks. My heart sank into my stomach as the realization that my world was falling apart hit me. The only woman I could truly connect with was a monster. I didn‚Äôt want to believe my love was so evil. I felt the color fade from my cheeks and I locked eyes with the officer. This act was instinctive. Even with the officer‚Äôs blackened eyes, I could see a softness in his expression. He seemed sympathetic to me.

He asked if I wanted to talk to Kenzie so I could get some closure. I don‚Äôt know if something like that was standard procedure but I didn‚Äôt think too much about that. I agreed, wanting to hear from her. She was led into the interrogation room, her hands and feet were cuffed. Tears were streaming down her cheeks, and her eyes were pitch black. She was chained to her chair so she couldn‚Äôt escape or try to attack me. Kenzie didn‚Äôt squirm. She didn‚Äôt respond to my questions, she just sat there. After a few minutes, she smiled at me. Her chin was trembling. She seemed almost relieved.

I began to scream and berate her. I needed to know why she did what she did. I needed to know who she really was. That woman in that room wasn‚Äôt the woman who I fell in love with. I didn‚Äôt know who she was. I had to be pulled out of the room as I kicked and squirmed. They took me to the waiting area for me to relax for a few minutes. One of the female officers asked if I wanted coffee to help me relax. She squeezed my shoulder gently, trying to make me feel more comfortable. Police station coffee is notoriously bad, but it was better than nothing. I nodded in agreement, before looking up at her. Her eyes were a golden hazel. She gave me a little smirk and a wink.
