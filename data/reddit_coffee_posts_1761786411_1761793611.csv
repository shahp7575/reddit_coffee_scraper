I’m into music that sounds like heartbreak wearing sunglasses (TV Girl, NBDH, etc.), late-night thoughts that turn poetic against your will, and humor that’s equal parts dry and slightly unhinged.

If you can go from sarcasm to philosophy without a gear shift, or you’ve ever stayed up too late just thinking, we’ll probably get along.

Not looking for small talk. Just something that doesn’t feel factory-made.

DMs are open, bonus points if you’ve got taste, a sense of irony, and at least one unresolved existential crisis.

1ojosi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/married/comments/1ojosi9/my_totally_normal_neighbors_got_into_swinging_and/,My totally normal neighbors got into swinging… and the ending was not what anyone expected 😳,"So I live in a small apartment complex where everyone pretty much keeps to themselves. My neighbors, are this super normal married couple friendly but quiet. Never any drama, never any loud parties, nothing.

Then one night a few weeks back, I hear them arguing. Not yelling like crazy, but loud enough to catch a few words. The wife said something like, “It was just something I said when I was wasted, I never thought you take it serious,” then he  said, “You’re the one who brought it up.” Then some back and forth but nothing crazy

About a week later, though, they had a few people over some music, laughing, you know the usual. Then it got quiet for a long time. I didn’t hear arguing, just… quiet. Let’s just say the vibes were different.

Fast-forward a few days, and boom another fight. This one was rough. She was cursing something like, you are Fing him now?!” and  , “I'm not the one planed this, it just happened! Then the wife stormed out.

Here’s the wild part: they didn’t split up. A few days later, I saw them out on their balcony drinking coffee together, laughing like nothing ever happened. Guess they worked it out somehow.

Can’t lie, though — every time I pass their door now, I kinda wanna know what chapter they’re on. This building’s starting to feel like a Netflix show.

1ojoqhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1ojoqhk/to_my_mika/,To my Mika,"Hi.

I don’t really know how to reach out to her anymore, but I know she’s a reader here, so maybe she’ll see this.

Just call me DX (M25). She’s Mika (F22). Everything started way back in 2019. I was bored one night, opened Omegle, and there was this random girl who just had this calm energy that made me stay. We talked for hours, then exchanged t*leg*am username. From there, we just clicked. We talked almost every day. She was still in senior high school then, while I was already in college. We’d talk about school, stress, or just basically everything.

We stayed in touch until 2021. Then one day, she just disappeared. Hindi kami nag away. She just stopped replying. She ghosted me. It honestly hurt more than I expected, but I moved on. Or at least I thought I did.

Then October 2022 happened.

I was hanging out with a mutual friend and guess who showed up — her. It felt surreal seeing each other in person after years of just chatting. Since we’d shared photos before, recognizing her was easy. That night, we exchanged soci*ls again, and this time, we started hanging out. A lot. Turns out, we were in the same university, so seeing each other became part of our routine. Coffee after class, random food trips, dates and we even travel outside city. I started falling for her again and maybe even harder this time.

One night, I told her that I wanted to court her. She hesitated. She said she wanted to focus on graduating with latin honors and wasn’t sure if being in a relationship was a good idea. I told her I understood and that I wouldn’t get in the way of her studies.

Still, we kept seeing each other. Sometimes, she’d drop by my c*ndo. She’d bring her friends along, which I understood because she just didn’t want to be alone with me. I did not complained. I was just happy she was there.

But 2023… That was the year I messed everything up.

I became impatient. I wanted more from her. More time, more attention, more commitment — and when I didn’t get it, I started to drift. I made stupid choices. I let temptation win. I talked to other girls. I told myself it didn’t mean anything, but it did, because it broke whatever trust Mika had in me.

Then came my birthday. She told me she might not make it because of a presentation, so I wasn’t expecting her. But she showed up unannounced and caught me doing it with someone.

She didn’t cry. She didn’t yell at me. She just stood there, looking at me like she didn’t know me anymore. Then she turned around and left. That blank look on her face was worse than any slap or scream.

After that, I tried everything to make things right. I went to her apartment. I messaged her every day. I even waited for her outside her building. For two months, I kept trying. But she wouldn’t give me another chance. She was done.

Life went on, but I kept spiraling. I got into another relationship and tried to convince myself I’d moved on but it didn’t last. I even got the girl pr*gn*nt, but we l*st the baby early on.

Then, April 2025, I saw Mika again. She looked really different. I can even tell that she's genuinely happy. Healthier. Freer. It hit me that I was no longer part of that version of her life and that I never would be again.

Still, I couldn’t stop myself. I tried reaching out, but she had already blocked me on everything. I switched numbers just to see if she still used the same one, and when she replied, I felt this rush of hope. I reached out too much, though. I crossed lines again. I made her uncomfortable.

She ended up filing a bl*tt*r against me. And honestly, I don’t blame her. Because the truth is she doesn’t owe me anything anymore. Not her time, not her forgiveness, not even her attention.

I know I ruined the best thing that ever happened to me. And this post is probably the last thing I’ll ever say to her.

To Mika,
I miss you. I’m sorry. For everything. You were the most genuine, loving person I’ve ever known. I took that for granted, and I lost you because of it. If I could go back in time, I’d choose to love you better with more patience, more respect, more honesty. You’ll always be the one that got away. If it’s not you, then it’s no one. I just hope one day, you’ll remember me not for my mistakes, but for the times we were happy.",1,1761793202.0,letters,1,1.0,False

So I met this girl through a friend, at first I really didnt think to much about it, till a few weeks we started to talk a lot more and pretty much figured out we had a lot in common. Shes way out of my league lmao and I honestly i thought i was just lucky. She started to talk about me to her friends that how I am such a great guy and how I treat her so well and etc and tbh I thought i was going well with her, we kissed one night and we held hands and so far everything was great. We used to go out every weekend, either to eat or just at a local coffee shop to study together and pretty much we used to do all those stuff you'd do as couples. I always used to drop her to car and always gave her a kiss on the cheek I really didn't wanna force out anything and I decided to take things slow. I also had planned out on asking her out but before that she like started showing a lot of mixed signals and I go so confused and I just had to ask her about it. Turns out she gave me ""I dont know what I want, I dont think im ready for a relationship rn"" then somehow she managed to spill that she was also talking to 3 other guys besides me but that I've been the one that treated her the best.  Shittiest night ever after hearing that from her, I stopped talking to her for a couple of days anddd uhh yeah we broke no contact after a week and here we are again. I set my distance at first and im sure she realized that I did, and somehow that got her mad for some reason that we arent talking as much and doing stuff together. We're still talking and hanging out a bit, but im not giving her the attention I used to give her. Last week, she asked me about this other girl that was clearly hitting up on me while I was at a party with a friend we have in common, she clearly got mad and jealous when she layed her head on my should  and she was like ""wtf is wrong with this girl, only I can do that"" I was so confused. Besides that I got on call with her earlier cuz she so dry today while we messaged, and now she went out with another guy ik and I can alr tell hes my oldself lmao, I really dont know what to do, i still do like her like a lot but at the same time i feel like theres this ""what if"".

1ojoki1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ojoki1/i_17f_had_an_argument_with_my_dad/,I (17F) had an argument with my dad,"I (17F) got a new retainer yesterday and I “lost” it this morning. My dad drove me to school I took it out to drink a coffee and placed it in the side door and even took a note about where it was in my phone. When I went back for it, it was gone for whatever reason and I can’t find it.

My dad got angrier than I’ve seen him in a long time and yelled at me that I “better find it” and to “fuck off” until I do (be out of his sight). It’s setting him off to even look at me now that I’ve lost my retainer and I don’t really see any solution to this. It’s not about the cost of a new one, he is genuinely losing his shit over the fact I lost it. 

He has a history of getting angry like this and screaming at me over objectively small issues, but this situation occurred after a period of time where I thought he was getting better at being my dad. It was the first time he’s screamed at me and insulted me in many years. He actively tries to avoid cursing and disrespecting me when screaming at me, so it really caught me off guard. 

What should I do to mend things with my dad? I’m not sure how I should even approach him. He usually screams at me and lectures me and then that’s that and he’s back to being stable and acts like it never happened within minutes, but this time it feels a lot more tense. Getting a new retainer is honesty not an issue at all and can be easily paid for, but he’s very adamant on me finding the one I have already have. I understand he has a lot of mental health issues and he himself is aware of his anger, but sometimes I think he’s not trying to change either. 

I get how this can seem like a stupid teenager to parent argument, but any advice would be helpful, thank you!! ",2,1761792699.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

In order to provide all members of the community an opportunity to view the reply by the Moderator team, we copied it for this standalone post and sharing it below.

\++++++++++++++

For those newer here or not familiar- this space is envisioned as visiting your favorite coffee shop/ tea house/ bar, meeting with friends - acquaintances around a table, and sharing about our life while sipping your beverage (personally I would choose tea).

Did you know Reddit mostly has younger people on it? We are making inroads with our community and elsewhere (anyone visit [r/generationjones](/r/generationjones/) recently?). But need your help too. Please do to tell friends/ family about Reddit and hopefully us- a worldwide peer community of people that retired at age 59 or later (and those almost there and at least fifty years old).

Most people on Reddit prefer to lurk, some actively comment in discussions, and few (like OP) occasionally post our conversations. The volunteer Moderators rarely provide content in our subreddit. We curate mostly to combat spam, remove posts that do not meet our membership criteria (just today we had … I am 31 years old and hoping to…), and cutdown on duplication of topics. This is in addition to working hard on the backend to make that posted conversations Come Alive by facilitating our discourse according to our guideline rules. And it shows. In addition to being seen as one of the most civil communities on Reddit .. we have grown into one of the largest communities of our kind - on the internet.

But back to the question. **Simply, the posts in our community are a reflection of what is submitted**.

So, we encourage all that are reading this, if you want to share .. be it on the light-side like the vehicle post we have now or more difficult such as the brave widower late last week.. and yes even topics like the ones OP has suggested,

**be the change**

You will be contributing to building up our community to be a more realistic cross section of all of us. But it can only happen if YOU make it so.

Are you ready to move from commenter (or lurker) to conversation starter? Here are the steps: First make sure you have Hit the Join button on the landing page (if not yet - do it now). While there, review the guideline rules to familiarize yourself with them. Next, you click on the Create Post (+) box. Do provide a title about a sentence long that reflects what you want to talk about and in the body expand on that in a simple paragraph, or more :) Lastly, hit the Post button. That is it!

And we All hope you do.

Thanks again OP and to everyone for making this, a community.

My husband just got a job opportunity in Stamford and, well… call us Jon Snow because we know nothing about Connecticut or honestly the entire eastern U.S. We’re both born and raised in a southern Colorado mountain town, so we’re used to: 

high elevation (over six thousand feet), a very dry climate (humidity? never heard of her), and, weather mood swings that go from “flip-flops” to “frozen tundra” in an hour.

I’ve read through a bunch of posts here but didn’t quite find one that matches our situation. So I’m hoping for some local wisdom from anyone who’s been through a similar move or just knows the area well.

We’re mostly wondering about:

1. Family-friendly culture — are people chill, community-oriented, etc.?
	
2. Good publicly funded stuff — libraries, museums, parks?
	
3. Locally owned food/coffee spots — he’s a coffee snob, but in a humble way.
	
4. Best schools/school districts — we have a little one whose education really matters to us. And I work in a school district. 

Please prepare me for what kind of chaos to expect. I am definitely looking forward to better public transportation. Colorado severely lacks in that department. The concept of being able to take a train to another city baffles me. Colorado is extremely car dependent!",2,1761792606.0,StamfordCT,0,0.75,False

Just another working professional looking for more reasons to get our the house...

Bit about me, moved here from the UK 3 years ago, work as an enginner (shocker) recently laid off but got myself incorporated so working on my own consultancy business. Love cats and used to volunteer with them and was into strength training for a number of years but took a year break roughly but recently got into boxing to get the weight back down. Pretty well travelled, educated and well spoken.

Not really looking for anything too demanding? Pretty busy with my own business, just looking for chill people to chat too over coffee or to try out new restaurants. I do enjoy chilling at home or working in cafes. Would be cool to meet other ambitious people to relate too but im pretty open minded.

 Ive been working from home for 6 years and most of the people ive worked with have been based in the states so meeting people here has been a continuous journey.

If you know what peep show is that is a big plus, also have a guilty pleasure of OSRS and I love board games, I have Nemesis lockdown and exploding kittens myself...

hello!  I used to feel full of potential.  I graduated salutatorian from a christian classical academy, and got a 32 ACT score.  i was particularly good at reading and loved doing volunteer work (i founded a volunteer club, student directed a musical, etc).  after high school, i followed the direction my parents wanted me to, and studied theology.. but after leaving their religion, I dropped out of college with my Associates degree in Theology 

I’ve since been completely directionless. I worked at a restaurant for years, but it was physically demanding.  then i worked at a library, which i loved, but it didn’t pay much.  i was a grant administrator for a non-profit, which was demanding and full of office gossips.  i was even hired as a teacher, but the workplace was full of bullies. i’m currently a manager at a coffee shop, and struggle with the physical and social demands ( i do have chronic illness and social anxiety disorder, but i push through it).  i feel like i’m wasting my potential since i did so well in school.  i want a job that feels like a career and actually feels right for me.  as far as i can tell, the ideal career would be interesting, pay well, and have a peaceful work environment.  any advice on where to look?

I’d like to commission a poster for a short film my boyfriend made as a Christmas gift this year. He loves 80s movies so I'm thinking it'd be cool if it was in that hand-drawn style, especially given the black, white, and neon colors in the film.

I think Stranger Things is a great reference point but also originals from the era like The Goonies and Fast Times at Ridgemont High that feature ensemble casts. Stylized, caricatured figures are totally fine/encouraged! Digital is fine too as long as it achieves that light-hearted, 80s hand-drawn look.

Here is the link to the film, it's about 10 min long and has a cast of about 10 people: [https://vimeo.com/941500529](https://vimeo.com/941500529)

More Details:

* Include film title: Anyone Need Coffee?
* Include: Written and Directed by Jared Pockalny
* It'd be great if you could also include the same ""Official Selection"" graphics you see in the thumbnail with the film festivals it made it to (Dumbo Film Festival, 2025; Canada Shorts - Canadian & International Short Film Fest., 2024). You could keep them simple.
* Deliverable: high-res digital file (PNG/TIFF, 300 DPI, printable \~18x24”)
* Budget: **$150 max**
* Timeline: I'd need the final file by **December 4th**
* Payment: Venmo, Paypal, or Zelle

If interested, please reply with a link to your portfolio / examples and a rough idea of whether this is doable in my budget. Open to suggestions. Thanks so much!

Im in a bit of a weird situation. Had to leave my previous communal house rental and now rent an in-law unit from my ex’s dad. He doesn’t live here, he rents the large chunk of the house (3bed 1bath) to a crazy lady in her 60s and I get the in-law which was a garage and enclosed patio for 1200 a month. Month to month agreement. 
When I got here, the unit barely had heat (1 duct) and stayed freezing from march to mid April because the patio was not insulated. He had to lend me two electric heaters but the lady next door complains the electricity bill is too high. So he attempted to insulate the patio only to find mold growing in the walls. He tore it down and turned it into a bedroom (It used to be a studio like situation before). 

He told me he had to redo the vinyl floor in the now kitchen/living room/bathroom because the lady’s washer had a leakage way before I moved in and there’s mold under them. A lot of the panels have lifted off the ground and separated, especially in the bathroom. 
The floor/wall trims are not attached to the wall and bugs come up them but he won’t fix them. 
Now in the bedroom the vinyl floor panels have come apart and he’s been notified months ago but won’t fix it. 
I had to force him to install a heater in the bedroom because it was freezing but the rest of the house is still cold. 
He said he’d get an AC during the summer and had me waiting for months only to not answer my texts when I asked for it last time. He saw the AC and called me stupid bc he said he would get one multiple times and I just had to be patient but it had been more than 3 months. 
Even the electricity is weird. My appliances (coffee machine and microwave) sometimes trip breakers and I have to go to the main side of the house to fix the issue. If I have the bedroom heat on and use the microwave, it either trips or won’t heat up my food. 
My gas stove has regulation/valve issues and I’ve come home to a house full of gas, no propane left in my tank, and unable to call fire department because he doesn’t have the proper permits and blames me for the gas leaks when my knobs have been on the off position and I’ve had gas stoves my entire life. 
The roof leaks and there’s stains all over the roof. He also stated he needs to fix it before it caves but that he doesn’t have the money which I know is a lie because he owns multiple properties with really high rents and he collects cash so he doesn’t have to deal with taxes. He constantly works and according to his daughter “has a million dollars” and refuses to pay taxes and get permits for things to cut corners. 
He builds and fixes everything by himself with “YouTube university” as his training. Even “flips” cars and resells them cash for a very high profit. 

He claims I have it good bc he didn’t charge me a security deposit and he let me paint the apartment the color I wanted and set up a fire pit in the back yard. That he’s not holding me here with a 6 or 12 month contract like “scummy landlords”

I recognize some people have it worse than me. I’m in the hunt for a new job and new living situation, but how can I get my landlord to do his job?

About a week ago I posted here asking for advice because, as a foreign student in Singapore, I was struggling to land any internships. I just wanted to say a massive thank you to everyone who shared tips, encouragement, and reality checks — it really helped me push through.

I’m super excited to share that I just landed my first internship at Carlyle AlpInvest as a PE Analyst for H1 2026.

Since I know a lot of people here are grinding through the same process, here’s my quick breakdown of what worked for me:
	•	Outreach matters (a lot): I sent ~1,500 emails, which led to 100+ calls and 50+ coffee chats. Don’t think of a coffee chat as the end goal — the goal is to get something out of it (a referral, an intro to someone else, or enough goodwill that they’ll push for you).
	•	Momentum > perfection: The key for me was slowly but surely convincing enough people within the same team that I was worth interviewing. It’s less about one golden chat and more about building influence across multiple touchpoints.
	•	Build your own narrative: If you can’t get an internship, do something on your own. Work on a project, learn a new skill, and find a way to showcase it. That makes a huge difference.

Things that didn’t matter:
	•	My GPA (it wasn’t great, they didn’t ask).
	•	Whether I was in a “prestigious” NUS club (I wasn’t, they didn’t care).
	•	Previous buy-side/IB internships (I had none, but I showcased my skills in other ways).

I’m posting this partly as a thank you, and partly as proof that even if you don’t tick all the “ideal” boxes, you can still break through if you’re persistent and creative.

Happy to answer questions if anyone’s curious — and good luck to everyone still grinding. It can happen.

“Lila” was another drawing of my dad’s. Not from the books, but something I got him to draw up for me. I wanted to give her a nice gift and I figured with his ability he could capture how I saw her. He really did. He was strangely hesitant at first, but to be fair at that point he was strange about everything. It’s probably long gone now, that was years ago. But now here she is, calling me. “Lila?” Was all I could get out, feeling like a weirdo for immediately knowing it was her. If you hadn’t noticed by now I try to keep a pretty nonchalant attitude about most things. I don’t mean to, it just happens. Growing up without a mother, my father being a terrible drug addict, moving away at 19, strange alien creatures in my house, whatever else. Most things didn’t affect me, but not her. She made me feel different.

I was right, it was her. She asked me how I was doing while also shuffling around the conversation of what happened with my dad. It felt kind of nice, the first conversation where I felt like someone close actually cared to know if I was okay. I let her know I was alright, cleaning out the old house and that I appreciated the call. That was about it, the call was only a few minutes and ended after she told me how she knew I was in town. Her boyfriend saw me earlier in town, guess she is still driving around in that musty car. Yeah, I didn’t get much done that day. Everything I looked at made me feel lost like there was no real place to start. I didn’t want to make piles of keep or trash, I didn’t want to keep any of it. At most the kitchen got cleaned, and I moved everything out of my bedroom. Turns out the cheap motel wasn’t very cost efficient for a college dropout that works retail.

Let me make that one thing clear. I’m poor. Or, was poor. I couldn’t afford to keep staying at the motel and realized that very fast. My plan was to sell the house, even though it was depressing to live in, it also had a good few acres of land that might help me stay on my feet for some time. Please don’t tell me I should’ve sold the old books, I couldn’t if I wanted to. The rights to everything still belonged to the writer somehow. It was a ton of legal crap I didn’t understand. So technically all of that was owned by Mark Frary. But also technically it was all burnt to ashes so whatever. Long story short, I was broke so I decided to stay in the house while I was cleaning it out. My goal was a good night's sleep and I did not get it.

I forgot how cold the house would get. It wasn’t insulated and all the small noises of the outside world were ringing in my ears. The small tapping of the tree limbs on the window, the wind howling and knocking the porch swing around, the loud roar of cars racing down the distant highway, echoing through the forests, the metal mail slot lifting up and falling again. It kept me up, kept me tossing and turning until I saw the sun shine through the blinds. I had worn the same clothes, even keeping my shoes on, not knowing if I’d catch a spare shared of glass while making morning coffee. But while making the coffee it wasn’t a piece of glass on the floor, but a letter. At the front door. FAN MAIL.

I assumed it simply because it couldn’t be anyone else. I cancelled my dad’s mail, no one ever came around for anything, and while growing up most mail was fan mail. I picked it up and started to read it while making my coffee. It was a pretty generic letter, nothing too personal, so I’ll let you read it too.

“Hi. To whoever receives this, I’m so sorry for your loss. If you need anything I would absolutely be there for you! I’m sorry if this is weird, I’m a huge fan of the MatchBox series and also, If you’re reading this, I love your father’s work! My favorite story will always be “Don’t Be Scared” and the way that the images throughout the book showed “The Snaret” and how it affected everyone’s lives. It really helped me find my own   Will to keep going through the hard times. It did a lot for me, and I really hope it’ll Help you the same way it helped me. It also inspired me to create something You might like, if you’re a fan of his work, that is. I was brainstorming one day and My mind went to a beautiful woman, someone that let herself to The Snaret. My Finest Creation, I didn’t know what to name her so I figured you could give it a shot. I stapled it to this letter to make sure it didn’t get lost! Answer me back. I need an update on what you named her!!”

Honestly wasn’t the strangest letter we ever received, but definitely a contender for top 10. I read the letter again. I didn’t know what they were talking about. What was “The Snaret?” I didn’t remember it from any of the stories I had read, but to be fair I stopped keeping up with them once I moved away. I flipped the page away to see the next, folded piece of paper stapled to it. I unfolded it while preparing myself for a crappy copy paste of one of my dad’s drawings. It wasn’t that. It was a perfect recreation. It WAS “Lila”. Like it was almost 10 years ago. Down to the freckles on her nose, the imperfections she had that I always loved. Whoever sent this either found that drawing somewhere wanting to pass it off as their own… or they really were inspired and perfectly recreated the drawing of her. I don’t know which one is more concerning; someone digging through Lila’s trash that happened to be a super-fan of my dad; or someone being able to draw my ex perfectly without, hopefully, ever seeing her before.

I tried to find out who sent this letter, maybe a name somewhere or an address considering they wanted me to write them back. The most I could find was a “P.s. Mark Frary is a moron” so I didn’t have much luck.",2,1761791956.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

He asked me to move in and I definitely see that in our future (not rushing, but it feel like time). I also love his little house. It’s small but has great bones - good woodwork, nice layout, and the yard is this wannabe gardeners dream. That said, my boyfriend isn’t that interested in being “handy”. Overall it just gives young man cave vibes, except it’s a whole house. There are mirrors and lights that haven’t been hung, beds without frames, no rugs, and the furniture that he does have, while comfy and kind of expensive, aesthetically I HATE. Same with placement of most furniture. I saw the Zillow of the house (when we first started dating - girls gotta make sure she’s not going to some sketchy place) and the house looked so nice!!! Like furniture and layout was great (not my style exactly) but looking like a family could live there.

So my question is to what degree can I move in and make changes? He owns the house and I don’t know what my payment situation would be. I’d love to buy some new furniture and paint some walls, decorate to make it feel more homey. Boyfriend has a little bit of trouble with change. He’s let me come bring a few things I got for free from work (rug/coffee table) but it took convincing- and that was free stuff! I don’t want to overstep but also I don’t want to live there and have it look like a single messy dude lives there. How do I approach this without overstepping or hurting his feelings??

1ojoar7,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1ojoar7/title_and_link_plz/,Title and link plz,"Husband moved his friend's pregnant widow in. I called Dad to cut funds and divorce.

Less than a month after the funeral, my marriage quietly began to crumble.
“My best friend is gone, and his wife is pregnant. She has no one to rely on.”
Ethan Lawford stood at the door with Clara Lewis beside him, his voice calm—too calm.
“She’ll stay here for a while. I promised Lewis I’d take care of her.”
He carried her luggage in himself, the same hands that used to hold me when he came home late from the firm.
Now they carried another woman’s life into our home.
At first, she was quiet. Fragile.
Then she began to fill the house with her presence.
She brought him coffee at midnight, murmuring, “You’ve been working too long, Ethan. You need rest.”
She lingered at the office doorway when he drafted case briefs, her eyes soft, full of grief and gratitude.
And every time, Ethan looked at her with that same patient sympathy—
the kind that used to belong to me.
I wasn’t naive.
I used to be a lawyer too. I recognized every emotional manipulation she deployed.
The evidence was all there—motives, opportunity, execution.
But what hurt most wasn’t her tactics.
It was that Ethan never once objected.
He gave her the guest room first. Then he gave up our bedroom.
And me? I became the stranger walking past two people who shared whispered grief behind closed doors.
Three years ago, I’d quit my position at my father’s investment firm to support Ethan’s career.
I funded his dream of opening his own law office.
Now, standing in the same home built from my father’s money, I watched him give it all away—to her.
I dialed a number with shaking hands.
“Dad,” I said, voice low but steady. “I want a divorce.”
There was a long silence. Then Charles Jameson’s voice came through—measured, dangerous.
“What did he do?”
I told him everything. The midnight visits, the cups of coffee, the shirt she wore, the sympathy he offered.
When I finished, my father said simply:
“Good. Do it. You don’t need permission. Remember—the Lawford firm exists because of my funding. I can pull it overnight.”
When I hung up, I felt an eerie calm.
As if disappointment had already prepared me for this ending.
The woman staring back at me in the mirror wasn’t the gentle wife who ironed Ethan’s shirts.
She was colder now. Sharper.
That night, I slept in the study.
The next morning, I walked into the kitchen—and stopped.
Clara stood at the counter wearing one of Ethan’s shirts, humming softly as she poured coffee.
It was my shirt. The one I bought him the day he won his first major case.
She turned, smiling lightly. “Good morning, Sarah. Didn’t sleep well? I heard you stayed in the study.”
I stared at that shirt, every word she said scraping against my patience.
“Take it off,” I said flatly.
Her smile faltered. “What?”
“I said take. It. Off.”
My voice carried the precision of a verdict.

1ojoa8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ojoa8l/i_froze_during_intimacy_the_red_flag_that/,I Froze During Intimacy – The Red Flag That Signaled My Relationship's End,"54M here – the chaser who turned 8 years of ""us"" into a regret-fueled wake-up call. Early on, things got intimate, and I froze mid-moment: Body tense, mind blank, her touch suddenly feeling like pressure. She pulled back, eyes flashing hurt (""What's wrong with me?""), and I mumbled ""nothing,"" but inside? Shame tsunami. Blamed stress, but it kept happening – that disconnect where vulnerability turned to walls. We powered through with ""it's fine"" talks, but it eroded us quiet-like. Spoiler: It wasn't ""just a phase""; it was the crack where trust leaked out, foreshadowing her ""space"" exit. If you've frozen in the heat (or watched your partner do it), you're not broken – but ignoring it? That's the silent killer. I wish I'd named it sooner; here's my hindsight advice from the ashes.

Grinding therapy post-split, I saw it as fear's freeze response – old wounds (past rejections) hijacking the now. If intimacy's hitting pause for you, here's the no-BS path to unpack without the fallout:

**Name It Without Blame – The Talk That Saves or Signals**  
Don't dodge: Pick a non-bed moment (coffee run, walk) and own it soft: ""Hey, I froze last time – it's my head stuff, not you. Can we chat boundaries?"" Listen first – her hurt's valid too. My ex shut down (""Just fix it""), which screamed imbalance. Green flag: Curiosity (""What can I do?""). Red: Accusation (""You're broken""). Pro tip: Frame as team – ""How do we make this safe?"" Builds bridges; deflection burns 'em.

**Unpack the Freeze – Your Solo Reset**  
It's often deeper: Anxiety (performance pressure), trauma echo, or resentment buildup. I journaled triggers (""Feels like I'm 'proving' worth""), then layered in breathwork (4-7-8 technique: In 4, hold 7, out 8 – calms the nervous system fast). Therapy gold: EMDR for stuck spots. Start small: Solo practice (self-touch sans judgment) rebuilds safety. For me, it took months, but post-NC, intimacy with myself (and later, my wife) felt electric, not electric chair.

**When It's the Endgame – No Contact as Your Thaw**  
If talks loop to ""try harder"" without mutual work, it's a sign: Frozen moments mirror frozen hearts. Don't chase ""fix us"" – go NC to thaw solo. Block the guilt-scrolls, stack wins (gym flows > forced sparks). I replayed our freezes as ""not enough""; NC flipped it to ""enough for me."" If they circle back? Test with transparency (""Therapy's my non-negotiable""). Real heal? Effort matches words.

That freeze wasn't failure – it was my body's ""pause for plot twist."" Now? Grateful for the redirect to connections where touch feels like home. You're worthy of ease, not effort alone.

Ever frozen in the moment, and what cracked it open for you? Share – no shame, just solidarity.

**TL;DR:** Froze during sex? Name it team-style, unpack triggers with breath/therapy, NC if no mutual thaw. It's a trust signal, not a sentence – rebuild for real sparks.

Some days, the weight of quizzes, activities, and deadlines makes me just want to disappear or quit entirely. But one thing I’ve realized: there were times I went to class with zero knowledge, yet just by showing up, that zero somehow became fifty or even 80 on some days. And that’s enough reason for me to keep going.

It’s always scary walking into school knowing what’s waiting for me, but at the end of the day, okay lang pala? The day passes, the pressure fades, and somehow I survive again. Then comes exam day, it always feels like being trapped inside a pressure cooker, but the relief after? Grabe. Unmatched.

It’s a repeating cycle of struggle, survive, repeat..and little by little, I’m learning to adjust. Med school has taught me that it’s not just about being smart pala talaga. It’s about endurance and courage as well. Because sometimes, showing up is already half the battle.

But lately, I’ve been struggling with one thing: staying awake. 😅

Doctors and seniors always say that losing sleep is part of med school and that I’ll have to sacrifice sleep if I want to survive. But honestly, I just can’t. My body needs 8 hours of sleep, minimum. Even coffee doesn’t work anymore. Kahit anong pilit ko, di na talaga kaya ng katawan ko ang puyat.

Instead, a select few are chosen to feed them intentionally.

	My neighbor, Mrs. Chapman, was one of the deer feeders. I used to think she was intimidating. There was no fence between her yard and ours, so after we’d moved in, my mother would chat with her while sipping her morning coffee. Mrs. Chapman spoke in a flat, humorless tone. Her eyes did not convey any particular feeling, unless my mother laughed, then a fleeting smile would cross her face. Her nails were short and chipped, her hands had thick calluses and thin, white scars. They talked about the weather, the mole hills in the lawn, the beautiful flowers around town. If you asked Mrs. Chapman, she could find a way for just about anything to be the deers’ fault.

	“They took down the soccer goals at the park. Damn deer must be getting tangled in the nets again.”

	“It's rutting season. That’s why your tires are flat.”

	“The window at the butcher’s shop is broken. Those damn deer.”

	“Why don’t they get rid of them?” My mother once asked. “Surely they’re not worth the trouble?”

	“You don’t hurt Ramsey deer,” said Mrs. Chapman. That was the answer anyone gave when it came to the deer. Like a bad football team, people would openly hate the deer until confronted about them. Our neighbors would shake their fists at toppled recycling bins and downed power lines, but at town hall meetings, they’d espouse the environmental benefits of the deer and the ethics of hunting. No, you don’t hurt Ramsey deer. Those are *our* deer. 

	The first time I saw a Ramsey deer up close was in the fall of 2010. I’d crashed into my yard and flopped into a freshly raked pile of leaves, certain that nothing was more difficult than middle school pre-algebra. The sky was streaked with orange and pink. The days were getting shorter, and I hadn’t gotten used to the early arrival of night yet.

	The first signal was the sniffing. Something huffed and puffed nearby, a sound deeper than what I’d heard my dog do. Then came the pawing and stomping. The deer had seen me and were curious. Two does filed out of the woods politely, and I sat in awe of their red pelts. I’d never seen deer with coats like this before; faint black streaks stretched over their haunches just like the stripes on a tiger. A stag came out next, velvet fur still covering his magnificent antlers. It was early in the season yet; their antlers would eventually shed that fur and be smooth.

	The deer looked directly at me. Their eyes were remarkably feline: forward-facing and round. The male stalked closer, faint scars criss-crossed his snout. I backed away slowly as he drew nearer. His yellow eyes reflected the street lights and seemed to glow menacingly. His lips curled—I hadn’t known they could do that—and revealed rows and rows of hooked teeth with deep orange enamel.

	“Alice.”

	The deer dropped its predatory stance. The does pricked their ears towards someone behind me. I scooted all the way backwards until my back hit Mrs. Chapman’s legs.

	“The deer! They’re—“

	Mrs. Chapman tutted at me and pulled me up by my backpack. “Stand tall, it’s alright.”

	I would’ve begged to differ, but Mrs. Chapman had already dropped a large, slightly damp cube into my hands. It was larger than my entire fist, and it dripped red juice down my wrists. Large flakes of salt coated it like breading on chicken. “You ever fed a horse before? Hold your hand out flat.”

	“Are you crazy?” I squealed. The deer all bared their teeth at the sound. I tried to hide behind Mrs. Chapman, but she held me firmly in front of her.

	“If you give them food, they’ll associate you with something good. Hold out your hand.”

	I watched one of the does prowl closer, sniffing the air curiously. I looked back at Mrs. Chapman, expecting her face to be inscrutable. Instead, she had the same smile she wore when joking with my mother. Subtle, but confident and kind. 

	The doe came closer. I shut my eyes and slowly extended my hand, expecting the scrape of teeth. A long, course tongue lapped at my fingers. Mrs. Chapman tutted at me for not holding my hand flat enough. I stiffened my elbow and held the cube up higher. Soon, all three creatures were lapping at my offering. I opened my eyes just in time for one of the does to delicately pluck the cube from my hand. She pranced away and shook her head, more deer-like than predatory. Mrs. Chapman tossed more cubes indelicately towards the other two, and the stag stupidly rammed his antlers into the dirt in his hurry to get one.

	I lowered my arm as Mrs. Chapman pointed to the ground. “Look.”

	The first doe had lain down, her yawn revealing many rows of teeth with a few missing canines. She lowered her head, and beneath her nose sprouted fresh, green grass. Beneath the other doe’s hooves, batches of verdant moss erupted from deadened grass. The stag, having finally retrieved his food, pulled his antlers out of the dirt, and in their place was a spray of delicate bean sprouts.

	Over time, I noticed more of what other people had to say about the deer. “I hate having them in my yard,” said the old man at the bakery. “But my garden’s never looked greener.” One of my classmates, a puny little girl, wrote a paper about her hero, Mrs. Chapman, who wrestled a soccerball from a deer’s mouth and returned it to her with a bouquet coming out of its seams. My own mother told me never to go outside while the deer were out, yet she cooed at a striped and spotted doe from the porch one evening.

	Today, there is a very tentative peace between the deer and the people. More people have signed up to feed the deer, but the complaints against them grow harsher and harsher each year. New construction has had to be cancelled due to ruminant interference. People have moved away. Parks are empty long before sunset. But as I sit on the porch watching a snaggle-toothed fawn wobble through its parents' trail of sprouts and buds, I can’t help but extend a cut of meat, and hope for beautiful blooms to follow.",1,1761790701.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

Together, they represent the basic sounds of the Japanese language.

* **Hiragana (ひらがな)** is used for native Japanese words, grammar particles, and verb endings. You’ll see it in everyday sentences, children’s books, and most beginner materials.
* **Katakana (カタカナ)** is mainly used for foreign words, loanwords, onomatopoeia, and emphasis — like italics in English. For example, *coffee* becomes **コーヒー (kōhī)** in Katakana.

Both systems share the same set of sounds but use different characters. Learning them is the first big step toward reading and writing Japanese — they form the foundation before you move on to **Kanji (漢字)**, the characters borrowed from Chinese.",1,1761790658.0,DailyKana,0,1.0,False

Fwd from Campaign for Southern Equality:
We will be giving away free grocery store gift cards at our Resource & Resilience Center this week. A lot of folks in our community are feeling the impact of losing SNAP benefits during the government shutdown, and we hope these gift cards can help our community out during this difficult time (cards will be available until supplies run out). 

The event will take place Thursday 10/30  from 11AM - 5PM at 20 Oak Street in Asheville. We hope to see you there!

For Tennessee Neighbors, here's a list of free pantries 
 https://netfoodbank.org/findapantry/

Feel free to DM me here and I'll try and get to it ASAP if you have something to add or want to get connected with my friends and my friend's friends and me.

If you have money you want to give to a group that's directly paying out grants to SNAP beneficiaries, 
Friends of friends from WV in the org New Disabled South put out a form to collect requests and got back over $2.7 million dollars worth of requests with a budget of $36k, so I reckon they could use the support and will get it to the folks that need it:

www.newdisabledsouth.org/donate

Bounty and Soul has a long history of getting folks high quality fresh produce every week, and we share a few volunteers with them at my day job @ Asheville Habitat. Can't speak personally to their financial situation at the moment,  but I'm confident they could use the support as well:

https://bounty-soul.givecloud.co/product/giving/make-a-difference-donate-today

I'm a 8+ year volunteer with Mutual Aid Disaster Relief and we've been running food and household necessities, ACs (in the summer) and heat fuel & firewood support to neighborhood distro sites since the storm hit (and a bunch of us are from here, and we ain't leaving!)
MADR has a Feed The People Program we use to make direct purchases of groceries and deliveries all over the US (and increasingly internationally)
Most of the fundraising efforts at the moment are centered around Hurricane Melissa Reaponse in the Caribbean and the 6.9 magnitude earthquake in Cebu City in the Philippines so we're spread pretty thin but remain active in the WNC region.
If you add 'feed the people' in your donation note, I can personally attest to it being allocated to meet food insecurity needs

Check on your neighbors, grab an extra couple cans of beans next time you're at the supermarket if you can afford to and pop 'em in a lil' free pantry.

We'll get through this together!

1ojnud1,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertykitchen/comments/1ojnud1/diy_bottled_coffee_replacement/,DIY Bottled Coffee Replacement,"When finances were better, I was a big fan of Java Monsters and pre-bottled, pre-canned coffees, and also of visiting coffee shops, which of course, added up a lot. I realized I was getting 1-2 per week, and that that wasn't best when our finances were rapidly declining, but I've started making my own bottled coffees and thought I would share the recipe in case anyone else wants to try.

You will need:

* Some sort of bottle. I was lucky enough to snag some 7-oz sized bottles that I really like for replicating the bottled coffee feel in a mini size, but you can literally just re-use bottles you have from other beverages if you need to, or make it in a mug. I just like bottles because it feels the same as the pre-made stuff, drinking and convenience-wise.
* Non-fat dry milk. You might end up getting this if you utilize a food pantry, so if you've been staring at it unsure how to use it, highly recommend this option if you've been missing coffee.
* Instant espresso. This is by far the most expensive part of the whole process, but it really does break down affordably. I like Nescafe Gold Espresso, get what you like, but Nescafe Gold is like... 50 servings for $10? It breaks down to being like 20 cents per serving.
* Your choice of sweetener. Sugar works fine. Those torani syrups work fine. Chocolate or caramel sauce from the dollar tree for 1.25 work fine. No sweetener at all if you don't like flavored/sweetened coffee works fine. Pick what's in your budget and in your home.

Here's how you premake them (recipe is for a 7-8 oz bottle, but if you have a larger bottle, obviously double or triple it).

\-Add your sweetener of choice to the bottle to your desired sweetness. When I have access to fancy coffee syrup, I add 1 pump, when I don't, a splash of flavored creamer or a half teaspoon sugar is good, but literally just sweeten to desired amount.

\-Add in 1 rounded teaspoon of instant espresso (tbh, this is where I vary, because to get the monster-like flavor and jolt, I actually do a half tablespoon, but this will mean fewer servings for your money).

\-Add in 3 Tablespoons powdered milk.

\-Fill bottle to almost full, leaving just a tiny bit of room for shaking. Shake, toss in the fridge, and re-shake before you drink it.

I've found that they taste good for roughly a week.

Notes:

**Obviously, this is more expensive than just drinking plain coffee and water.** However, if you are going from an expensive bottled coffee or coffee shop habit to this, it *is* a big money saver and will help you a lot with cutting that expense, especially if your trigger point is the grab-and-go nature of a bottled coffee. This is not for the ""just brew a cup of coffee"" crowd.

**Obviously, this isn't the most ""nutritious"" way to use powdered milk.** But again, if you are used to having a bottled coffee, and it is this, or watching the powdered milk sit on your shelf because you're not sure how to use it or if you'll like it, this is a good way to overcome any texture concerns or any flavor concerns by fully masking the flavor.

**Obviously, use what you have.** If you have brewed coffee, do a different ratio and play with it. If you don't like sweet coffee, don't sweeten it. If you want it thicker, add more milk powder or add powdered creamer. If you suddenly get a windfall of creamer from your local food pantry (one time, we got 16 bottles of pumpkin spice creamer because it was going into winter and stores were taking them off the shelves, so they donated literally a thousand+ bottles to the local food pantry of a perishable item, so we worked with pumpkin spice creamer for a while in these). If you have a soda bottle, don't worry about buying fancy aesthetic glass bottles on Amazon or whatever. Rinse and reuse, make it your own, have fun.

Tbh, for me, this has been the most effective in kicking my bottled coffee habit and also making me realize how much I was spending on coffee to begin with. Like, I'm not the millennial ""If you'd simply cut out your daily starbucks, you could buy a house"" kind of person -- it is literally not that kind of savings -- but if you're like ""finances are tight, where is my little treat?"" the way I am, this is a viable option. 1 can of Java Monster is $2.50 here. For the price of 5 Java monsters, I can have a bottled coffee every day for 2 months. It's not an elimination, it's a swap to something that is more budget-friendly, while still keeping your daily little treat.",4,1761790564.0,povertykitchen,0,1.0,False

Afterward, we went back to BIL & SIL’s house for cake and presents. We had the cake and the adults were having coffee and chatting, while my niece and her brother played in the other room. I hadn’t realized how late it was getting but finally went in to give my niece her presents. When I did, I found she had opened them and was reading one of the books I got her. I was shocked and asked why she had taken them out of my purse. She immediately looked embarrassed and apologized, but said we were taking so long and they were poking out the top. I told her that was no excuse and took the presents back. She teared up but seemed to understand. My husband, BIL and SIL came in the room and asked what was going on. I told them. Immediately, SIL starts yelling at my niece, telling her to go to her room and saying they’re taking away the gifts they gave her that morning. Niece apologizes again and runs up to her room, sobbing. My husband tries to talk his SIL down and is looking at me for help, but I back SIL up. BIL (husband’s brother) is pretty quiet through the whole thing.

At home, my husband told me I was wrong to make such a thing of it and I should’ve tried to defend our niece. His arguments:

1.    Our niece has never done anything like this before, which is true. She is usually a very polite and respectful kid. Her parents are strict and don’t play around with this kind of stuff.

2.    We were taking a long time to get to gifts. And he says that looking back, a lot of the night was spent on the adults and not my niece. Which, again, may be true.

3.    It was her birthday. In his eyes, we could’ve handled it quietly and talked to her about not doing it again, especially as she apologized.

My perspective is that while the above all may be true, it may be a hard lesson she has to learn. She’s 11, not 2. Her brother is younger than her and has never tried this either, so it’s a good lesson to him as he witnessed it. The next day, our niece sent us a handwritten apology letter and now I am starting to feel like maybe I went too far. AITA?",0,1761790391.0,AmItheAsshole,197,0.49,False

I go over to the pot. It's full and the brewed grounds are still steaming so it's safe to assume the coffee was recently made. Should be no issue. I bring the coffee over and tell him the he's in luck since a batch was recently made. He becomes skeptical and gives it a taste. He makes a face and says it not fresh and that he can tell since he drinks it all the time. Before I can offer to remake it, he ask if I put it in the microwave. I get serious and tell him we never reheat the coffee because it's a health and safety issue. I go ahead and offer to remake the coffee but then he decides that the coffee is okay and says I don't need to.

He says he'll take my word for it about the coffee being fresh and says that the taste might be the bottom of the pot being burnt. I tell him we don't use glass pots anymore and the warmers have been deactivated since the thermal pots are enough to maintain the coffee temp. He takes the coffee and leaves. I don't get why he even made a fuss about the coffee in the first place. It was obviously still fresh and still steaming. If he didn't like the taste, I could have made a new pot with no issue since he was going to have to wait for it anyway since he requested it it be made fresh. To also imply we reheat the coffee in the Q-oven felt insulting. Rant over. ",3,1761790332.0,McDonaldsEmployees,6,0.8,False

I built [StormAP.ai](http://StormAP.ai), an AI tool that using Copilot and Cloude Sonnet 4.5 turns your brainstorms into interactive mind maps, deep dives, and even full articles. It's all about exploring ideas visually without the chat clutter.

But here's the cool part: A fellow Redditor suggested letting users *edit directly into the AI's generated responses* and *link separate bubbles across maps*. Boom – instant remote concept association! That's how breakthroughs happen, right? Connecting unrelated dots like ""quantum physics + coffee recipes"" sparks wild innovation.

Just implemented it, and it's game-changing. Thanks, u/[gipsee\_reaper](https://www.reddit.com/user/gipsee_reaper/) – you rock! If you're into brainstorming, check it out at [StormAP.ai](http://StormAP.ai) and tell me what you think. Free to try!

1ojnqr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CutAndFrame/comments/1ojnqr3/stop_crying_over_missing_imovie_your_ultimate/,Stop Crying Over Missing iMovie: Your Ultimate Windows Alternative,"Okay, real talk: you fire up your Windows laptop, ready to slap together a quick video, and it hits you - iMovie doesn’t exist here. Not a trace. Your Mac friends are dropping cinematic transitions like they’re throwing confetti at a wedding, while you’re stuck staring at Windows Movie Maker like it’s 2003 all over again. If you’ve ever wished for a legit iMovie Windows alternative, trust me, you’re in good company.

Here’s the thing: iMovie video editing software is beloved for a reason. It’s clean, intuitive, and somehow makes you feel like a Hollywood editor even if your most professional video to date is a shaky clip of your dog doing… dog things. But don’t panic - the Windows ecosystem has grown up, and you don’t have to cry into your coffee over missing Apple perks.

Here’s my personal iMovie Windows Alternative list that I consider to be truly right.

**👍Shotcut / OpenShot** – Free, open-source, and surprisingly capable. Multi-track editing, transitions, and color tweaks are all there. Not glamorous, but functional - kind of like discovering a slightly nicer, less judgmental version of your first crush. You’ll stumble, curse at some menus, but eventually, you’re cutting clips faster than you thought possible.

**👍DaVinci Resolve** – Okay, this is the one for people who secretly enjoy torturing themselves with pro features. Free version is great, pro version is borderline ridiculous. It’s a steep learning curve, but if you want full control over color, audio, and effects, it’s worth the brain burn. And let’s be real - feeling like a mini-Hollywood editor while your first video is just your roommate spilling cereal is priceless.

**👍HitFilm Express** – Another free gem. Handles layers, effects, and basic compositing like a champ. Perfect for anyone who wants to level up from “cut, paste, export” to “I might actually post this on YouTube without embarrassment”.

Here’s the weird part: switching from iMovie can feel terrifying at first, but it’s also liberating. You can customize nearly everything, install plugins, tweak formats - and Apple isn’t silently judging you for using 1080p instead of 4K. You will crash a few times, curse at the interface, maybe even accidentally export a 2-hour black screen file at 1080p… but when you finally hit play and everything works, it feels like winning the lottery.

**How I Actually Get Stuff Done**

* Import your clips - yes, all of them, even the blurry ones.
* Drag onto the timeline and begin cutting. Avoid overthinking; perfectionism is your enemy here.
* Add transitions and effects sparingly. Remember, you’re not Michael Bay (yet).  
* Export in the format you need. Watch it. Celebrate small victories, like avoiding a blue screen or realizing you didn’t accidentally delete the audio.

Keep calm! Windows editors might not hold your hand like iMovie, but that’s part of the charm. You learn a few hacks, discover shortcuts, and eventually, you’re editing like a pro - or at least, like someone who won’t publicly shame themselves with a glitchy YouTube video.

Switching from iMovie to a Windows editing tool isn’t painless, but it’s freeing. You might miss the simplicity at first, sure. But when you realize the amount of control you have - layering clips, mixing audio, tweaking color - you’ll start thinking, “Maybe I don’t need iMovie at all.”

So Reddit, I gotta ask - what’s your go-to iMovie Windows alternative? Do you prefer Shotcut, DaVinci Resolve, or Movie Maker? Have you had any hilarious crashes, accidental exports, or moments that made you question your life choices mid-edit? Share your war stories - I’m always looking for sanity-saving hacks and a good laugh.",1,1761790278.0,CutAndFrame,0,1.0,False

I can't believe this moment is finally here – my SaaS product is generating revenue, and I’m over the moon! 🌕

A Little Backstory

I started this journey with just an idea. A small, scrappy prototype built during late nights, fueled by endless cups of coffee (and a few mental breakdowns 😅). Honestly, I doubted myself a million times. Who would care about my product? Who would even pay for it?

You know the one – ""You've received a payment of $19."" It took me a second to process, and then it hit me like a freight train.

What My Product Does

The product is Its a software solution that is useful for at least a few reasons I can think of:⁠

1. Its a reddit tool that helps you find the best unmoderated subreddits for you to promote yourself or to claim these subreddits. The database containing the subreddits is constantly updated. Another feature is allowing you to see the best time to post in any sub.
2. Can be used to find abandoned subreddits with active, engaged members but no moderation team. By claiming these subreddits, you take control of a ready-made community in your niche—perfect for building authority, driving traffic, or even monetizing through ads, affiliate links, or memberships. Or if you're just passionate about the topic and want to run it yourself :)
3. ⁠Don’t want to take ownership, you can still use the database to identify subreddits relevant to your niche and post your content, products, or services here.
4. You get the best time to post in a subreddit, this ensuring the best visibility of the post.


Why This Means So Much to Me

I’m not some big startup founder with investors throwing money at me. I don’t have a fancy office or a huge team. It’s just me, grinding every day, figuring things out as I go. This $19 is so much more than just money – it’s validation. It’s proof that someone, somewhere, found enough value in what I’ve built to actually pay for it.

What’s Next?

For me, this is just the beginning. Now that I know people are willing to pay, it’s time to double down. More features, more marketing, and maybe even more subscriptions? Let’s see how far this can go.

# Why the CEO's Yes Means Nothing If You Haven't Met Trevor from Finance

Dear Political Navigator,

There's a spreadsheet on my computer called ""Deal Deaths 2019."" Row 47 still makes me wince.

**Company**: Fortune 500 manufacturer **Champion:** CEO (enthusiastic) **Budget:** Approved ($8M) **Competition:** None (sole source) **Close probability:** 95% **Actual outcome:** Dead

**Cause of death:** Trevor

Who's Trevor? Excellent question. I asked the same thing when the deal died.

Trevor, it turns out, was a Level 3 Financial Analyst. On the org chart, he was somewhere between the coffee machine and the car park. His email signature didn't even include a title. But Trevor had something more powerful than a C-suite corner office: everyone's trust.

For fifteen years, Trevor had built every financial model for major purchases. When executives said ""run the numbers,"" they meant ""ask Trevor."" When the board wanted validation, they wanted Trevor's spreadsheet. When procurement needed ammunition, they called Trevor.

I never met Trevor. I didn't know Trevor existed. Until Trevor's model showed our payback period was ""questionable,"" and my done deal became a dead deal faster than you can say ""stakeholder mapping.""

This is the story of how I learned that power and authority are distant cousins who rarely speak—and why the most influential person in any enterprise deal is usually someone whose name you can't pronounce and whose job title you don't understand.

**The Beautiful Lie of the Organisation Chart**

We've all been there. First day of the sales cycle. You pull up the company's organisational chart like a treasure map. ""There's the CEO! There's the CFO! If I can just get to them, I'll close this deal!""

Adorable. Also, completely wrong.

The org chart is corporate fiction—a bedtime story we tell ourselves about how decisions get made. It's like using a map of London from 1605 to navigate modern traffic. Sure, the Thames is still there, but good luck finding your way to Heathrow.

Here's what the org chart shows:

* Who reports to whom
* Who gets blamed when things go wrong
* Who has the nicest office
* Who gets invited to board meetings

Here's what it doesn't show:

* Who everyone asks for advice
* Who knows where the bodies are buried
* Who the CEO calls at 10 PM with problems
* Who can kill your deal with a raised eyebrow

Real power in enterprise organisations flows like water in an M.C. Escher painting—upward, downward, sideways, and occasionally in dimensions that shouldn't exist.

**The Five Types of Power That Actually Matter**

After the Trevor Incident (yes, it deserves capital letters), I became obsessed with understanding organisational power. Here's what twenty years and thousands of deals have taught me:

**1. Positional Power: ""The Obvious Suspects""**

* **Who has it:** C-suite, VPs, Directors
* **What they control:** Budgets, approvals, signatures
* **Why it matters:** They can say yes
* **Why it doesn't:** Anyone can say no
* **How to spot them:** Look for the corner offices and executive assistants

**The Reality:** These people have the authority to approve deals, but rarely have the power to push them through. They're like the Queen in chess—theoretically powerful, practically limited.

**2. Expert Power: ""The Deep State""**

* **Who has it:** Architects, analysts, specialists.
* **What they control:** Feasibility and risk assessment.
* **Why it matters:** They define what's possible.
* **Why it's dangerous:** They speak in technical terms that terrify executives.
* **How to spot them:** Look for the people everyone says, ""check with…""

**The Reality:** One technical architect saying ""this won't scale"" kills more deals than all CFOs combined. I once had a deal murdered by a security analyst who'd been there three months. Three months! But he had ""CISSP"" after his name, and that was enough.

**3. Relationship Power: ""The Shadow Network""**

* **Who has it:** Executive assistants, long-term employees, internal consultants
* **What they control:** Access, information flow, informal influence
* **Why it matters:** They shape opinions before meetings happen
* **How to spot them:** They know everyone's kids' names and coffee orders

**The Reality:** The CEO's executive assistant has more influence over your deal than most VPs. Why? Because she controls the calendar, sees every email, and has been giving her opinion for fifteen years. Ignore her at your peril.

**4. Cultural Power: ""The Tribal Elders""**

* **Who has it:** Company veterans, culture carriers, unofficial historians
* **What they control:** What's considered acceptable
* **Why it matters:** They define ""how we do things here""
* **How to spot them:** Their offices are museums of company history

**The Reality:** Every company has someone who's been there since the IPO/founding/merger. They might be a mid-level manager now, but their opinion carries the weight of history. When they say, ""We tried something similar in 2008,"" everybody listens.

**5. Information Power: ""The Data Wizards""**

* **Who has it:** BI analysts, data scientists, spreadsheet maestros
* **What they control:** The numbers that justify (or kill) decisions
* **Why it matters:** Executives trust data more than vendors
* **How to spot them:** They're invited to meetings despite having no official role

**The Reality:** Remember Trevor? These people build the models that make or break your business case. They're the ones who decide if your ROI is ""conservative"" or ""aggressive,"" if your assumptions are ""reasonable"" or ""optimistic.""

**The Real Organisation Chart: A Field Guide**

Here's what the actual power structure looks like in most enterprises:

**The Inner Circle** (2-3 people)

* The CEO's actual trusted advisors
* Rarely matches the official executive team
* Often includes one surprising wildcard
* Makes the real decisions over coffee, not in boardrooms

**The Kitchen Cabinet** (5-8 people)

* Unofficial advisory group
* Mix of internal and external voices
* Includes at least one veteran who ""knows everything""
* Where ideas get pre-approved or pre-killed

**The Operators** (10-15 people)

* The people who actually run the business
* Middle management heroes nobody knows
* Control implementation reality
* Can sabotage any initiative through malicious compliance

**The Network Nodes** (3-5 people)

* Super-connectors who know everyone
* Information brokers
* Political weathervanes
* Can build or destroy consensus

**The Wild Cards** (1-3 people)

* Rising stars being groomed for leadership
* Board members' favourites
* Founders/early employees with special status
* People with dirt on everyone

**How to Map the Real Power Structure**

Forget LinkedIn Sales Navigator. Here's how to actually map influence:

**The Coffee Question**

""If you needed honest advice about this decision, who would you grab coffee with?""

The names that come up repeatedly? That's your real buying committee.

**The Veto Question**

""Who could kill this project if they wanted to?""

These people need to be neutralised or converted, regardless of title.

**The 2 AM Question**

""If this went horribly wrong at 2 AM, who would you call?""

That person has more influence than any org chart will show.

**The History Question**

""Who's been here longest in this area?""

Institutional knowledge equals institutional power.

**The Success Question**

""If this works perfectly, who gets the credit?""

The person positioning for credit is often driving the decision.

**The Coalition Building Playbook That Actually Works**

Here's my framework for building a coalition that closes deals:

**Phase 1: Intelligence Gathering (Weeks 1-2)**

**Never ask:** ""Who are the decision makers?"" **Always ask:** ""Help me understand how decisions like this typically get made here.""

Map every name mentioned. Pay special attention to:

* Names mentioned with reverence (""Oh, you should really talk to Sarah"")
* Names mentioned with caution (""Well, James will have opinions"")
* Names mentioned repeatedly by different people
* Names mentioned with no title (""Check with Dave"")

**Phase 2: The Approach Sequence (Weeks 3-6)**

**Start with the Sceptics:** Counter-intuitive? Yes. Effective? Absolutely. Converting your biggest doubter creates momentum. Plus, sceptics often have the most influence—that's why they're comfortable being sceptical.

**Then the Experts:** Get technical validation before the executive presentation. Nothing kills deals faster than an executive asking their architect, ""Will this work?"" and hearing silence.

**Follow up with the Veterans:** Respect institutional knowledge. These people have seen vendors come and go. Honour their experience, and they'll honour your solution.

**Recruit the Rising Stars:** Align with future power. They're hungry for wins and willing to champion bold moves.

**Finally, the Executives:** Present consensus, not concepts. By the time you reach the C-suite, the deal should be 80% done.

**Phase 3: The Momentum Machine (Weeks 7-10)**

Create wins for everyone:

* Give sceptics credit for identifying risks
* Let experts design technical approaches
* Have veterans share the historical context
* Let rising stars present to leadership
* Make executives look visionary

Document everything:

* Email confirmations of support
* Meeting notes with agreements
* Technical validation documents
* Risk mitigation plans
* Success metrics agreements

**Phase 4: The Political Architecture (Weeks 11-12)**

Design the deal to manage politics:

* Clear wins for every stakeholder
* Protected territories for the territorial
* Growth opportunities for the ambitious
* Risk mitigation for the conservative
* Glory for the glory-seekers

**Tales from the Political Trenches**

**The Competitive Miracle:** Lost a deal to a competing vendor. Six months later, their champion left. We maintained the relationship with the Trevor-equivalent (a BI analyst named Rachel). When implementation failed, Rachel called me. The deal was reopened, and we won it because we'd invested in the invisible network.

**The Veto Gotcha:** We spent six months courting the CTO. We had a perfect technical fit. The budget was approved. The deal died because we’d never met the CEO's chief of staff, who had unofficial veto power over all technology decisions. Now I always ask: ""Who's the CEO's most trusted advisor?""

**The Toyota Triumph:** We discovered that the real power belonged to a quality engineer who'd been there 30 years. We spent three days in Japan learning about their production system from him. He became our champion. The deal closed in record time because ""Yamamoto-san trusts him.""

**The Political Navigation Phrase Book**

Here are the exact words that have saved deals worth millions:

**For the Threatened Middle Manager:** ""Your expertise becomes more valuable with this system, not less. You'll move from managing tasks to managing strategy.""

**For the Sceptical Veteran:** ""You've seen everything. What would need to be different this time for you to believe it could work?""

**For the Ambitious Rising Star:** ""Someone's career is going to accelerate because of this project. Why shouldn't it be yours?""

**For the Nervous Expert:** ""Your technical approval carries more weight than any executive's. What would you need to see to stake your reputation on this?""

**For the Political Executive:** ""How can we structure this so you get credit for the vision while being protected from the risk?""

**The Uncomfortable Truth About Enterprise Politics**

Here's what nobody will tell you: Enterprise sales is 20% solution fit and 80% political navigation.

You're not selling to a company. You're selling to:

* The executive worried about their legacy
* The manager worried about their job
* The analyst worried about their credibility
* The veteran worried about their relevance
* The rising star worried about their trajectory

Each person needs a different version of winning. Your job is to design a deal where everyone can claim victory.

**Your Political Audit Challenge**

Take your most important deal. Map the following:

1. **The Official Power:** Who's on the org chart?
2. **The Actual Power:** Who really influences decisions?
3. **The Hidden Power:** Who haven't you met but keeps being mentioned?
4. **The Opposition:** Who loses if you win?
5. **The Coalition:** Who wins when you win?

Then answer: What would Trevor think of your deal?

Because I guarantee you, there's a Trevor in every deal. The question is whether you'll find them before or after they find you.

**The Eight-Million-Dollar Epilogue**

Remember that Fortune 500 deal Trevor killed? Two years later, I was back. But this time, I started with Trevor.

We spent three hours understanding his model. Incorporated his feedback. Had him present the financial analysis to the board. When executives asked, ""What do you think, Trevor?"" he said, ""This is the most robust business case I've seen.""

Deal closed at $12M. 50% larger than the original.

At the contract signing, the CEO said, ""Trevor really believes in this."" That's when I knew I'd finally learned the lesson: In enterprise sales, the org chart is fiction, but Trevor is always real.

Until next week, when we explore the trust equation and why being the smartest person in the room is the fastest way to lose the deal.

Navigate wisely,

Gari Johnson

i hate my coworkers because they don’t know what they’re doing and i can’t do my job without getting info from them first. i felt so alienated which made me start looking for a new job.

i’ve had enough of it at the end of aug when my manager was gone for two weeks for vacation and no one was responding to me. i had to also wait for my manager to get back in order for me to do my job. i always get anxious talking to my managers manager because she’s so smart and i feel like she just doesn’t have the patience for people who don’t understand something right away. the way she talks about external parties makes me believe she probably does the same within the company. but i make so much mistakes in front of her because i overthink.

so i talked to my manager and opened up about my frustrations of me switching to a different role. she said and she knows i just don’t like what i do anymore because she could tell with my work and performance that i didn’t like the job. so she had no choice to put me on PIP to hold me accountable for my work and i couldn’t get back my old role because the rest of the team is fine.

now, i started lexapro in sept and turns out, my job isn’t so bad and my manager is trying to do everything she can to make sure we are moving along without any bottlenecks. i have the motivation to finish my work and i was even able to work on other projects i’ve been holding off on. then i was just passively applying for jobs and i heard back from a few. 

i found this job with a higher title, better pay with less hours of work and easier work as well. the thing is, i would give up my remote job, go hybrid and drive 45 mins. the company i am interviewing for have older people and i would be standing out a lot as a californian living in the midwest. i get along with my manager and my coworkers are all around my age. they travel a lot, while these people are more settled with their family and live a simple life. honestly, my main goal is to get out of the corporate world and start a coffee shop, so ultimately, i just want to get in, and get out.

i also just think about how privileged i am to even have this choice and to even keep this job for 3 1/2 years. 

but my point is, lexapro just changed everything and i wish i got on it sooner😭😭😭 i was on it before but it made me so drowsy and i hated it. then my therapist suggested to take it at night and my psych said that’s fine but to just monitor my symptoms. 

i used to get so hot at night, had a few nightmares, lost my sex drive and i still get interrupted sleep. but i feel so much better at work and i have less anxiety 🥲 the good outweighs the bad and i think it’s worth it i suppose.

idk. vent over. i am seeing my therapist tomorrow. thanks for reading <3

1ojnccs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ojnccs/how_to_get_rid_of_excessive_yawning_once_and_for/,How to get rid of Excessive Yawning once and for all?,"Hello all,

I struggle with the aforementioned condition. *I don’t think i struggle with anxiety?* But I do get random tremors sometimes throughout the day, and I have had chest problems in the past where I’ve had to go to the ER 3 times in the span of 7 years. None of these were “serious enough” to require follow up care. Just random. Twice in college when I was out of school and chilling in my dorm. Once when I was home by myself when no one was home—and I actually thought that I could die. All of these events 24 and under.

Outside of that, I am for the most part a  healthy 30 yr old male, and weigh 210 at 6’1. However, whenever it’s time to engage in reading, studying, or any type of learning of any kind, my brain and body just immediately rejects it. I can’t go more than 10 minutes without my first yawn. And once that first yawn comes in—especially if I’m trying to read a book, or a light magazine, the next yawn comes immediately after, and then another and then another and then another. It should be noted that if i immediately go to YouTube; TikTok; or any other video/tv mechanism, all of that fake tiredness and yawns go away.

I have actually charted myself. And my max yawns in one hour were 44! I come totally vulnerable seeking free help, because I can’t afford a doctor right now. But when I was in the military a year ago, they did a brain scan, I went to a behavior specialist, they really went above and beyond and did a whole bunch of tests on me… and didn’t find anything. The last thing they were going to do was a sleep study, but that required a “special authorization” off base to a “regular doctor”, and the higher ups in the medical clinic weren’t willing to sign off because it wasn’t “mission critical” and didn’t “affect my job” (since I was getting out in 6 months).

Even though I disagreed with that BS at the time, there wasn’t anything I could do. I never realized this at first that I was struggling because I  have had large bouts and time, between the time that I first entered college (2013) and the time I graduated (2019). I never was a poor student, but didn’t read a lot growing up on my own, because I lived in a chaotic household. I chalked being tired all the time in college to my early morning (7:45) clases and never connected it to the possibility that it could be another condition.

But now looking back, as I prepare for another journey— Law School, and having finished my military time; this bout of excessive yawning has returned with a vengeance.

To preface, I have averaged 8hrs of sleep since getting out of the military. I study when I wake up with a light breakfast taking breaks in-between. I exercise regularly. I have no “disabilities”, save for maybe—whatever this condition is. I have tried coffee, stimulants, sleep, naps, running, cold showers, and any and most things that you could think of, and all have failed :(

When I study today; I use speechify and read along with the audio. I also do this with kindle books and the Libby app. What this allows is that, if I do yawn, I am still progressing forward in the text through listening, and can easily return to the information; rather than before where I had to struggle and waste time finding my place when  two more yawns  were coming within that same minute. My eyes still get watery. The yawns still don’t stop. On the rare occasion that it does stop, and this is RARE, I have to do this audiobook/yawning process for two and half to three hours MINIMUM. After that sometimes, my brain allows me 1 hour of reading unencumbered. But if I’m studying for a long period of time, this simply is not realistic.

I feel completely hopeless because I feel like a crazy person explaining this to other people. It’s such a hidden condition, but it’s depressing that there is no one true solution to this problem.

It’s impossible or very difficult to study for the LSAT because I can’t just speechify the books I’m reading and doesn’t stimulate test day conditions at all.

If you’ve read this far: you have a special place in my heart. Thank you in advance.

TLDR: I have had excessive yawning I believe since I was young. Didn’t realize it then. No diagnosis. But impossible to be productive vis-a-vis learning any new material that requires reading. Please help. Nothing conventional has solved my problem.",1,1761789174.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

I love him deeply and I know he loves me too. I’m currently 13 weeks pregnant with twins. We already have two kids (ages 8 and 6). I’ve been crying a *lot*. Like all the time. My husband says I even cry in my sleep sometimes. It started when we told the kids the babies’ genders. Were having a girl and a boy. My daughter and son were both upset with the idea of having a brother and asked me if I could ask the doctor to change him to a girl. This made me unreasonably sad, and since then I’m like a waterfall. I cry about the lightingu in our kitchen, the temperature of our indoor pool, dropping my engagement ring behind the toilet, the smell of baby lotion…literally everything feels so moving and I see how hurt my husband gets by seeing me so constantly distraught.  I feel guilty about the emotional exhaustion of constantly having to calm me down. 

We both work from home usually, and we spend most of our time together. Even on our busiest days, we’ll join for lunch at least. That means he’s always around for my crying, and he always feels the need to make it better. Which is great. But i can see it’s wearing on him. 

An old friend of  mine from college has been in town for a couple weeks for a work thing, and he and I met up to get coffee three days ago. We caught up and then during it, I got really emotional when he asked me about my pregnancy. We’ve already named the babies, and my husband chose the girl name, which has a really beautiful meaning for us. I got choked up and cried in front of my friend which is totally out of character. But he’s really sweet and we used to be really close for years. We only lost touch because he moved overseas. He let me vent and I didn’t feel like a burden to him, so I did. I confided in him, though it’s nothing my husband doesn’t know or hasn’t heard a million times. But I was able to get everything out all at once without him trying to fix it or taking on so much emotional labor himself. I felt good. 

Anyway, I came home after coffee and I didn’t cry at all for the rest of the day, even when stuff that would usually really upset me (well…pregnant me) happened. My husband kept looking at me weird, like I was a zoo exhibit or something. When we got into bed he asked me what happened and why I suddenly wasn’t crying. He knew I went to get coffee with my friend but I didn’t necessarily know if that was related to my feeling better, so I just said I didn’t know. 

Fast-forward to today. It’s been three days since then. I haven’t cried, and I’ve gone to see that friend during his lunch break each day, during which we talk about what’s bothering and upsetting us and it feels cathartic by the end of it. My husband is still completely vexed by what’s changed and I told him that I’ve been talking to my friend about stuff at lunch, but he got upset about this and said that I’m only supposed to confide in my husband, and that’s the point of a marriage. I know this is how he feels and always has, and generally it’s worked for us, but right now I feel like he’s annoyed with my constant tears and like I’ve been burdensome by bringing every little problem to him. He feels like I’m not being faithful if I bring my problems to anyone but him though. I have no idea what to do or what to think. I love my husband and I see his point but I also think this situation is a lot more nuanced than he’s letting it be.  ",0,1761789113.0,Marriage,24,0.5,False

My husband and I are attending a cousin’s wedding in El Real de San Vicente, Spain (about 1.5 hrs from Madrid) in mid-July 2026. We live about 45 minutes south of Rotterdam and plan to drive all the way from the Netherlands to Spain, making a proper road trip out of it!

Here’s our *current plan*:

**Outbound route:**  
📍 *Starting point:* Klaaswaal, NL  
➡️ **Stop 1: Épernay, FR** – 6h drive (with lunch + coffee break) → **2 nights**  
➡️ **Stop 2: Tours, FR** – 5h drive → **1 night**  
➡️ **Stop 3: San Sebastián, ESP** – 8h drive → **3 nights**  
➡️ **Stop 4: Madrid, ESP** – 7h drive → **1 night**

**Main:**  
➡️ **Stop 5: El Real de San Vicente, ESP** – 1.5h drive → **2 nights** (wedding)

**Return route:**  
➡️ **Stop 6: Madrid, ESP** – 1.5h drive → **1 night**  
➡️ **Stop 7: Biarritz, FR** – 7h drive → **3 nights**  
➡️ **Stop 8: Poitiers, FR** – 8h drive → **1 night**  
➡️ **Stop 9: Rouen, FR** – 6h drive → **1 night**

🏠 **Back to Klaaswaal, NL** – 7h drive

We’re aiming for a **good mix of sightseeing, relaxation, and manageable driving days**, but I’d love to hear what you all think:

* Do these stops make sense geographically and time-wise?
* Are there any *better alternatives* for some stopovers (especially on the way back)?

Thanks so much! Any advice from those who’ve done long EU road trips would be super appreciated ❤️",0,1761788606.0,roadtrip,0,0.5,False
1ojn3p0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ojn3p0/excessive_yawning/,Excessive Yawning,"Hello all,

I struggle with the aforementioned condition. I am a healthy 30 yr old male, and weigh 210 at 6’1. However, whenever it’s time to engage in reading, studying, or any type of learning of any kind, my brain and body just immediately rejects it. I can’t go more than 10 minutes without my first yawn. And once that first yawn comes in—especially if I’m trying to read a book, or a light magazine, the next yawn comes immediately after, and then another and then another and then another. It should be noted that if i immediately go to YouTube; TikTok; or any other video/tv mechanism, all of that *fake tiredness and yawns* go away.

I have actually charted myself. And my max yawns in one hour were 44! I come totally vulnerable seeking free help, because I can’t afford a doctor right now. But when I was in the military a year ago, they did a brain scan, I went to a behavior specialist, they really went above and beyond and did a whole bunch of tests on me… and didn’t find anything. The last thing they were going to do was a sleep study, but that required a “special authorization” off base to a “regular doctor”, and the higher ups in the medical clinic weren’t willing to sign off because it wasn’t “mission critical” and didn’t “affect my job” (since I was getting out in 6 months).

Even though I disagreed with that BS at the time, there wasn’t anything I could do. I never realized this at first that I was struggling because I  have had large bouts and time, between the time that I first entered college (2013) and the time I graduated (2019). I never was a poor student, but didn’t read a lot growing up on my own, because I lived in a chaotic household. I chalked being tired all the time in college to my early morning (7:45) clases and never connected it to the possibility that it could be another condition.

But now looking back, as I prepare for another journey— Law School, and having finished my military time; this bout of *excessive yawning* has returned with a vengeance.

To preface, I have averaged 8hrs of sleep since getting out of the military. I study when I wake up with a light breakfast taking breaks in-between. I exercise regularly. I have no “disabilities”, save for maybe—whatever this condition is. I have tried coffee, stimulants, sleep, naps, running, cold showers, and any and most things that you could think of, and all have failed :(

When I study today; I use speechify and read along with the audio. I also do this with kindle books and the Libby app. *What this allows is that, if I do yawn, I am still progressing forward in the text through listening, and can easily return to the information; rather than before where I had to struggle and waste time finding my place when  two more yawns  were coming within that same minute*. My eyes still get watery. The yawns still don’t stop. On the rare occasion that it does stop, and this is RARE, I have to do this audiobook/yawning process for two and half to three hours MINIMUM. After that sometimes, my brain allows me 1 hour of reading unencumbered. But if I’m studying for a long period of time, this simply is not realistic.


I feel completely hopeless because I feel like a crazy person explaining this to other people. It’s such a hidden condition, but it’s depressing that there is no one true solution to this problem.

It’s impossible or very difficult to study for the LSAT because I can’t just speechify the books I’m reading and doesn’t stimulate test day conditions at all.


If you’ve read this far: you have a special place in my heart. Thank you in advance.



TLDR: I have had excessive yawning I believe since I was young. Didn’t realize it then. No diagnosis. But impossible to be productive vis-a-vis learning any new material that requires reading. Please help. Nothing conventional has solved my problem.",1,1761788530.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I'm a bit nervous posting this, but I spent the last few months (aka way too long lol) building something I wish existed: a curated database of actually good local cafes around the world.

When I travel, I hate arriving in a new city and Googling ""coffee near me"" only to get chains and tourist traps, so I wanted to find the spots where locals actually hang out, you know the ones with good vibes, real espresso, and maybe a decent pastry.

**What I built:** [bestlocalcafe.com](https://www.bestlocalcafe.com/) \- A searchable database of cafes across cities, slowly expanding from a few targeted regions (some cities have placeholders just as a self-reminder to continue adding.) You can search by location or browse by city, though I'm sure there are a ton of features I've not even begun to think about..

I'd love to hear some feedback as this is all brand new to me (I've never made a website, nor really knew what I was doing.. just kind of imagining things I'd like to see.)

Some asterisks to mention - most of the site is fully functional, though ""Features and Amenities"" needs some work as there are a lot of generic placeholders (I'd love to see what folks really want marked in these!) Also as mentioned, many cities are left out of the running which will be added in slowly!

Of course, at home I have a wife, six kids, three cats, and a regular parade of interruptions; at work I’m a department chair who tries to maintain an open-door policy; and I’m not really ready to be my coffee shop’s first VR guy.

My Nanna, my mum’s mum, was a hoarder. It was pretty confronting for my mum when she had to clean out my Nanna’s house after Nanna died. It was all hidden in wardrobes, but there was just *so much crap*. And she was a very typical hoarder: didn’t let anyone in the house, would freak out if you tried to come in, wouldn’t let you see her stuff, etc. 

My mum is the opposite. Every now and then she gets to a point where she suddenly needs to throw everything away. She starts going through the house section by section, figuring out what to take to the op shop. And she’ll take other peoples stuff (mine and my dad’s) without double checking, even if it’s something we use (she wanted to through out one of my coffee mugs, luckily I saw it before she did. She also threw out all of my dad’s “old” clothes without him knowing). 

And if you call her out on it, she guilt trips you about how much stuff you have. If you like something and want to keep it, she’ll yell at you to “move on” from it. It’s like she can’t handle keeping anything for too long. 

It’s just the lack of trust and boundaries. I feel hyper protective of my stuff because she wants to get rid of it all, and I never know if she’s going to toss it or not. I don’t really know what to do. ",5,1761788062.0,hoarding,4,1.0,False

Maybe we can go to an arcade, or go bowling. I would be open to going to a sporting event, but I normally don't watch sports much. I’m single, and if we click I would be open to see where things go.

I’m an Armenian-American guy who loves great food, music, and good company. I’m a foodie, a Shiba Inu enthusiast, and a Yankees fan. I sometimes root for the Dodgers but I am not a dodger fan. I love penguins, but I picked the Shiba calendar over the yearly penguin calendar. My usual coffee mug is a SeaWorld or NYPD Mug. 

I like comedy and action, TV shows and movies. I enjoy playing video games and watching anime, mostly I listen to LitRPG audio books. I enjoy a vast variety of music especially City Pop, Classic Rock, Irish Punk, Harry Belafonte, Jimmy Buffet, Viza and Reggae. Three of my favorite movies are Kung Fu Hustle, Blazing Saddles, and The Blues Brothers


 Most of my video games are single-player, but I’m open to trying multiplayer if you’re on Steam, especially if you play fallout 76.
  
Games I like: Borderlands 1&2, Dave the Diver, Skyrim, Yakuza 0, GTA Vice City, Sleeping Dogs, Fallout 76, Hogwarts legacy.

Anime I like: The GetBackers, Dr. Stone, The Way of the Househusband, Record of Ragnarok, Cells at Work, Cells at Work code black, Thermae Romae Novae, Delicious in Dungeon, and Mashle.

I'm extremely introverted so it's hard to make new friends, and I think I prefer people similar to me(and similar age as well) since we might get each other more. I'm also a massive nerd and I do like my maths and physics and I've had so many maths memes I want to send to someone but can't coz I don't know anyone who does maths or physics. Also want to game with someone(I mainly game and do physics, but I also do normal activities like archery, climbing, running, batminton, gym). Also just want someone I'll just vibe with immediately, just wanna skip the awkward small talk at the start while dodging in and out of do I talk more or not stuff. Ik it's not realistic, but its a nice comfort thought. I think as a massive introvert I'm just very bad at small talk, especially with new people. Whereas with people I already know I can talk about the stuff I want to talk about and be familiar and make talking easier and actually enjoyable and not tiring.

Basically if you think that when we start talking and the vibe is immediately like the picture below, then you're the right person. Come chat.

Between dealing with some toxic coworkers and it being around the time my dad committed suicide two years ago, I’ve been in a really bad head space. I still get random depressive episodes because of it. I went to therapy after his death, but had to stop recently because work has been so busy.

Usually, I’m able to stay functional, but something triggered me the other day and I completely spiraled at work today. I called out sick for tomorrow, it’s the first time I’ve ever done that. I know my manager and coworkers have noticed a change in me lately, I’m usually joking around, laughing, and eating lunch with everyone, but I’ve been pretty withdrawn. Today was especially rough, and I’m sure my boss noticed, he even got me my favorite coffee and bagel, I’m
assuming to cheer me up.

I feel bad for bringing negative energy into the workplace, but I just can’t seem to shake this slump. Should I explain why I’ve been acting differently, or would that be too much? Should I just stay quiet unless he asks? I only ask because, while my boss is nice, he often talks about “lazy” workers, and I don’t want him to get the wrong impression of me.

My husband agreed to take off work to stay with him for the day - but he says he didn't vomit again or act sick in any way. Did he get car sick? Food poisoning? Dizzy from an ear infection? I have no idea and it's probably best I don't think about it much (though I hope it doesn't happen again tomorrow for both our sakes).

I'm proud that I still drank my coffee and ate my lunch at work. I still hugged him and played with him when I got home. And I still cleaned the puke out of my car (joy). Am I washing my hands like crazy? Absolutely. But I don't know, seems like a win for the most part.

6. 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle)

Concept: For many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes. Identify and focus on that vital 20%. Top 1% Prompt:

Act as a strategic business consultant. I am applying the 80/20 Principle (Pareto Principle) to my work.

Please analyze this list and:

Identify the 'Vital 20%': Which 1-3 items on this list are likely to generate 80% of my desired results (my desired result is \[e.g., 'revenue', 'career growth', 'personal satisfaction'\])?

Identify the 'Trivial 80%': Which items are consuming most of my time but yielding few results?

Your task is to:

Motivate: Give me a short, powerful reason why this method works (hint: visual progress, loss aversion).

Set Rules: Help me define the exact, non-negotiable, minimum requirement for 'getting the X' for the day. (e.g., 'Is 15 minutes of focused practice the goal? What if I only have 5 minutes? Does that count?')

Present the output clearly, with each task sorted into its quadrant.

19. Task Batching

Concept: Group similar ""shallow"" tasks together (like email, admin, or errands) and do them all in one dedicated time block. Top 1% Prompt:

Act as an efficiency expert. My to-do list is a mix of deep work and shallow tasks, and context-switching is killing my focus.

1ojmpbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ojmpbu/advice_on_flirtinggauging_interest_in_more/,Advice on flirting/gauging interest in more neutral settings,"To preface, 23M, have been in multiple relationships & ONS. However, I feel I'm honestly terrible at flirting/being forward without explicit interest being expressed first. Pretty much all my relationships/hookups have been from the woman being very forward with me and making the first move. Obviously I want to get better at this, and have gotten better, but I still struggle in more neutral settings, like class (my current dilemma) vs dating apps/the bar where it seems acceptable to be more forward and flirty at first (still struggle more than I'd like even in those settings).

I have a lab with this woman (24) in my group once a week, I've also missed a few labs/shown up late and usually run off right after to work on my homework that is due in my next class. So we haven't talked much, but we're definitely the most talkative in our group. I'd say I'm generally social and have good energy and joke a decent bit in class. I am definitely physically attracted to her and I like her personality and energy from what I can see in our lab.

The other day, she was walking a bit behind me leaving class, and I struck up a conversation with her. As we were walking past the cafeteria, I asked her if she'd like to grab coffee. I offered to pay (casually enough, just asked what she wanted after I ordered, but to show slight interest ig? She said it was fine, which I would expect from either a friendly encounter or an encounter that could have potential interest but being impromptu). Long story short, we ended up talking a decent bit and going to a few different places on campus over the next 4 hours until we had different classes to go to. I found we actually had a lot in common, and shared a lot of the same values, and I very much enjoyed talking to her. We did talk about some more personal topics as well. And I'd say eye contact and energy was good.

We left off a bit suddenly (didn't realize she was going into a specific door + both of us pretty adhd). I have her number being in a lab group chat with her, so a few hours later after my class, I decided to follow up, to say I had a good time to indicate interest while trying to keep it casual enough as to not make it seem creepy since I never directly asked for her number. I pretty much just said it was nice getting to talk to her more, since we left off a bit suddenly, and I appreciated the help with something/snacks, keeping it lighthearted. She replied later that night saying she enjoyed it and was glad we got to talk more outside of our lab.

I feel with a lot of the people I get into relationships with have kinda just built by back and forth exchange of information, and I compliment/flirt more as I grow more comfortable (feel it goes both ways). But I understand the need to flirt more to make intentions clear, especially in more neutral environments. And of course it's nice for the tension it builds. However I also feel more uncomfortable trying to be forward as a result of that. I tried to get some basic touch in (touching her thumb asking what happened, asking her to touch my collarbone and guiding her hand to a point on it), but that was probably all I'd consider maybe flirty outside of good energy/eye contact and personal convos. I was honestly a bit out of it from the first day on a higher dose of medication that makes me more emotionally flat/serious, which didn't help.

Some more info I feel is relevant: I don't want to accidently come across as just being friendly, and our major is like 9:1 men to women, so I could understand if it's possible she could just be excited to make friends in classes, as direct flirting/upfront intentions is really what clearly defines being more than friendly for both parties.

Apologies for the extremely long-winded post, I'm a serial overthinker as you can tell. Any advice regarding how to flirt better and gauge interest in situations like these without being creepy? And any advice on if what happened so far could be read one way or another? Should I just go ahead and ask her on a date this weekend, or is that too soon, and should I talk/flirt to her more on our class day/try to establish more casual hangouts at first?",1,1761787423.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1ojmm7g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ojmm7g,R3BEL CRT PORTABLE NES Skin now updated for MANIC. Complete with OVERSCAN!,"**\[R3BEL CRT PORTABLE\]** for iOS!  [\[R3BEL CRT PORTABLE\] for Manic Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/116_D8ROw87y8ecyToN83y2FD5AMxTGnO?usp=sharing)

These are CRT style skins that have been updated to be compatible with MANIC EMU. Using Manic's built in CRT Filters to distort the game screen you can create a bubble style screen similar to the old CRT televisions. They are definitely not perfect CRT's, but they do simulate it pretty well.   


**MANIC UPDATE NOTES:**

1. Moved the control buttons (D-Pad and the A+B Buttons) slightly higher for better ergonomics and less hand cramping. 
2. Added animated button support. Visual button presses on screen which helps with screen recording.
3. Added an additional A+B Combination button which is positioned directly between the A and B buttons. This helps with actions like keeping sprint held down while jumping in Mario by sliding your thumb from one button to the other.
4. Removed all CoreImage Screen Filters due to compatibility with Manic. Alternatively you can use the built in CRT Screen filters that Manic offers. I personally use the ""CRT v2"" filter and ""Canonical"" color palette. However this skin should still work without any filters applied.  
5. Removed the reflective bezel that is available on the Delta Emulator version. Again this is due to Manic's compatibility with Core Image filters. 
6. This version is NOT COMPATIBLE with Delta Emulator.

 

**RELEASE NOTES:**

1. The CRT PORTABLE versions have complete control sets to play on the go
2. Currently only available for NES on MANIC EMU
3. iPhone versions, only supports edge-To-Edge iPhones (no home buttons)
4. In addition to the labeled quick utility functions there is also a hidden ""FFW"" button on top of the game screen/display 
5. There are also invisible combination buttons (A+B) located just around the AB Cluster and positioned between the A and B buttons  

**OVERSCAN:**

* This Manic version has a single overscan which is cropped in by 8pixels on the sides and about 2 pixels on the bottom. Top 0, Bottom 2, Left 8, Right 8  
   * *If you have any requests for specific games to crop out the black borders that these do not work for. Please let me know.*  

As always, feedback is always welcome. Good, bad, or ugly. all is welcome ;)

1ojmm44,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ojmm44/something_hatched_in_the_nickel/,Something hatched in the Nickel,"Hello. The past three days since that night have been a swirl of packing, making calls, talking to managers, moving out and in, and trying to barely think about what happened, but I’m going to post this as a little insurance. That’s if I can even type it all out—every creak of flooring and every door slammed in my building feels like death.

I’m going to change the names around, but someone very close will reveal this is real if my company tries anything. I don’t think they really would, but I’m on such an edge right now I couldn’t get the thought out of my head. So here I am.

My name’s Riley, and I work as a night watchman. I’ve been trying to make a music career work, but the money hasn’t exactly been flowing. My bass player Mule—his real name’s Stan, but he carries our heaviest equipment so we call him Mule—and I got the job together, and for the last five months, it’s been great.

We’d work shows from evening till night, then we’d go to work and make our rounds talking about the band. The worst thing that ever happened was just stuff like snakes or birds tripping alarms. All of this is to say I would have been content to keep the routine for years, until Wednesday night.

The company I work for is pretty big and owns a lot of blue-collar sites, and the one I was working at is a nickel refinery. We don’t have many of them in the US, but the one I worked at is a pretty busy one. Anyway, we were probably halfway through our shift. Mule was in the parking lot, and I was heading up onto a catwalk above a pile of raw nickel. We were playing this game where one of us hums a song and the other has to guess the band.

“Hm hm hm… hm-hm-hm hm hm hm”

“It’s Queen, ‘Another One Bites the Dust.’”

Mule would usually throw me the basics. It sounds like a boring game, sure, but when it’s dark and every gust of wind or fallen leaf makes you jump, it helps ease your nerves. I was passing along the catwalk, losing to Mule as he guessed a Soundgarden song, when I started absentmindedly kicking bits of nickel.

Filtered rocks piled out from a sieve a little ways off the walk, but bits would still fall onto it. They would scrape across the metal and make a dull sound below:

*S*c*r*e*ec*h

**Thud**

Mule was checking out a truck for a second, so I was all alone. In those moments between words, you really have to force off any nerves and just pretend like you’re in control. I came to another rock:

S*c*r*e*ec*h*

**Thud**

When I say pretend to be in control, I just mean you have to throw off the “technicallys.” Technically, someone could be sneaking up behind me, but technically, if I turn my back, whoever’s waiting ahead could take their shot. Another rock:

*S*c*r*e*ec*h

**Thud**

The best you can do is just keep forward, hold your nerves, watch, and hope. I heard a bang of metal somewhere far off, and I began to listen in close. There was a final rock:

S*c*r*e*ec*h*

**Th-crack**

Hissssssss

My attention snapped below. I tried to tell myself that it was a snake, but a snake couldn’t hiss loud enough to hear from a catwalk. Besides, this noise was different.

“Hey Mule, I heard something weird. I think there’s some animal in the facility, I’m gonna go check it out.”

“Okay, sounds good. That truck was fine, by the way, someone just forgot to roll their windows down. I swear, man—”

He rambled on, but even with Mule talking, the silence was thicker. Sounds like the rattling of the stairs was actually eerie again, but I was still able to pretend it was nothing important.

I wasn’t too sure after I saw a large chunk of nickel, split in half, oozing with a grey, pungent slime that led away.

I radioed in and explained to Mule.

“...Really?”

“Yeah, man, come down here and look at this shit.”

Despite my instincts, I threw a look over my shoulder.

“I don’t want to deal with this alone. I think I might go ahead and radio in to the others.”

Mule and I were only junior watchmen, so we just got a taser and outside watch. The senior watchmen actually had guns and were assigned to the file rooms.

“Well, you know the rules—we only radio if something’s wrong.”

“Seems like something's wrong to me!”

“*Sigh.* Yeah, I meant like if we actually see something. I mean… what’s to say it’s not just some hibernating reptile or something?”

“Bro, it came out of solid rock.”

“Listen, just wait there. I’m heading your way. You’re in the East wing, right?”

“Yeah, I’ll be waiting here.”

Three agonizing minutes passed by as I waited. Three minutes of jumping at birds flying off, staring and darkly theorizing at the slime, and barely breathing to keep quiet. I almost had a heart attack when I was struck by Mule’s flashlight for the first time.

“What took you so long?!”

“Calm down, man, it’s not—*Whoa.*”

Mule flashed his light over the rock. I saw the fear creep its way over his face, but then he fought against it.

“Look, Riley, this is definitely freaky, but it’s our job to deal with stuff on our own before calling for backup.”

I stood there locking eyes with him, shifting on the spot. He had a point, sure, but I wish I’d had the spine to tell him no. Probably wouldn’t have changed anything, but still, it would’ve been better.

“You remember what happened to Jane? She had one false alarm, and they put her off duty for a week!”

“Okay. Okay, fine.”

I scanned around. Whatever was leaking out of the nickel only went a few meters beyond it.

“The trail leads down that way, but there’s a fork south and north. I’ll take south, alright?”

Mule scanned around a bit, trying to seem in control, before answering.

“Okay, sounds good.”

I remember getting some of my confidence back after regrouping with Mule. It really began to be feasible in my mind that this was some rare animal we hadn’t heard of. We went on our separate paths, and the paranoia began to eat over me once more. My radio sparked up:

“Hmmmmm hm hm hmmmhmm hmm—”

“Look! Now’s not the fucking time.”

“Alright, man, calm down. We’ll get this over with first.”

“Good, and besides, that was ‘Wayward Son,’ and you made it obvious.”

I found nothing—just some high-dollar equipment that wasn’t locked up. After I set it in its place, I radioed in.

“Mule, I’m not finding anything on my end. It probably is some kind of lizard or something. I’ll keep looking, but—”

“Riley,” he was speaking in a shaky whisper, “I found something. It looks like some kind of husk.”

“...What does it look like?”

“It’s like—oh shit!… WAIT W-WA—AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!”

The radio pierced my ear with static, but I didn’t bother to turn it off as I ran back the way I came, taser out. I found a break room trailer with the door open, but all was silent. I began to make my way over to the door, but suddenly a streak of shiny grey-black came hissing out of the darkness. I fired my taser the moment I saw it, without aiming first, and I put up my hands to brace. It hit me with more force than I expected from something so small, and I felt a wet, searing pain run over my arm. I dropped onto my back, and whatever it was ran off farther into the facility.

I was trying to catch my breath, but the pain in my arm was taking it away. I ran into the trailer and flipped the light on, but pain or not, the macabre and disgusting sight of Mule froze me for a moment. I ran over to the sink and ripped off my jacket and ran my arm under hot water.

Across my left forearm was a grey, shimmering slime, and though it was cold as ice, its acidity burned like hot steel. I only got hit with some residue off its body though, so I was able to wash it off. It hurt me to do so, but after I was done, I turned around.

There are many scenes from that night that will haunt me, but seeing Mule, laid out over the coffee table, eyes and mouth agape, in a petrified scream as the rest of his body was melting into shimmering goo and red slush, will hurt me for years to come. Even the band pins on his coat were melting—those were his favorite.

I went back outside and picked up the radio I’d dropped. I found it, too, had gotten a slash of acid, and was subsequently buzzing and chirping uselessly.

I had two options: hole up in the trailer and hope it didn’t come back, or make a break for the security office. My nerves were too shot to think clearly, but hours of loneliness with Mule’s disintegrating corpse was still a hard sell. Besides, I still had a job to do.

I started walking. Each breath and step felt like trying to soundlessly drag a bag of metal pans. At that point, it didn’t matter what the noise was; it made me jump and stand still all the same.

I wouldn’t say I’m not brave. I had respect from the other security workers, and I’ve handled myself well, but what are you supposed to do? Stay calm in the face of some unknown thing that’s as fast as a wasp and melts skin?

I began to pick up on a trail that, much to my nausea, was in the direction I was headed. Scenes like forklifts seared down to a third, discarded bits of flesh, and sickening pieces of molted grey skin began to pop up. I kept on, until I saw a reflective mound ahead.

One of the other watchmen, Ted, had been attacked. All that was left of him was bone, a few stray scraps of flesh, and his radio. I almost marveled at how fast this thing could pick someone apart while I clicked it on.

“Hello, this is Riley. Something’s loose in the facility, and I need help. I’m just outside the office, so meet me down here.”

No response. I set it on SOS and kept walking, but I soon heard a noise. It reminded me of a dog eating kibble, and when I rounded the corner, I saw it.

Most of it was just a dark grey silhouette, but I could make out many details. Somehow it had grown to be at least three meters. Its body was long and covered in shiny hairs that looked sharp as needles. Its arms—there had to be at least seven pairs—were busy probing over a pile of raw nickel. I watched it consume pounds and pounds of nickel as leftover flesh flicked off its sharp body. I was just standing there, peeking around an excavator, when my radio suddenly sounded.

“Hey, Rile—”

I snapped it off and ducked under the machine. The noise had ceased, and it became deathly quiet. Silent as it was, I could still hear it inching towards me. Under a half moon’s light, I could barely see the bottom of it over the long rubber wheels. Time had slowed down. Acid saliva dripping down seemed to take minutes, multiple legs piercing the soil beneath felt like hours, and then, when it was only a couple meters away, I began to hear its high-pitched hum.

“RILEY! WHERE YOU AT?”

“Tracker says he’s just over there.”

It sounded like my supervisor and some of the other senior watchmen. My heart sank when the thing flipped around and rushed towards them.

There was nothing I could do. I just sat there as my ears were barraged by the sounds of screams, a terrifying insectoid warble, and gunshots. When I heard the crunching of bone, I nearly began to cry.

The feeding was over quick, and I suppose it had forgotten about me because everything was silent before long. It still took some time to drag myself out though. Once more I was faced with a choice: stay there and wait to be hunted, or make for the security office where they lock our phones up for a shift. I chose the latter, and I suppose the guilt of my cowardice helped push me forward. I’ll spare you the details of the “leftovers,” but it’s enough to say the number of bodies only left me and some scattered junior watchmen.

I found the office undisturbed as I quickly bolted the door behind me. There’s a main tracking system that shows where each radio is in the facility. To my surprise, one of them—Leonard’s—was heading straight for the office. It then hurt me dearly to realize it was only me and him left. As the first light of day shone through the blinds, Leonard came smashing into the office door, and I think I almost gave him a heart attack when I unbolted it and popped out at him.

“AHHH!”

“It’s me, man, calm down!”

“R-RILEY! This fucking thing, it attacked me and Chris, and—”

“I KNOW, I KNOW! Just breathe and keep quiet, man!”

I pulled him in and locked up. We sat there unloading on each other.

“I can’t believe Mule’s dead, Riley.”

“I—I know.”

My thoughts turned to him. Rotting in that trailer, when we should be getting off to go sleep right now. I thought of our dreams, all our plans. Taken away. The only thing I could do for him now was to try and get this thing caught.

“Leonard, keep watch. I’m gonna go get my phone to call the cops.”

My hands were still shaking, so it took a few tries to get the combination lock off, but once I did, I dialed 911 faster than you can imagine. As I was beginning to explain things to a tired operator, Leonard’s face made me pause. He looked mortified.

I knelt down beside him and separated the blinds. There, at the end of the yard, we saw it. It was over twelve meters long and it was climbing over the fence, dragging a pair of legs with it. And, not far behind, something small followed. Something with shiny hairs and dozens of legs.

Once it was gone, the whole night and its implications finally dawned on me. These monstrous killers were loose, and I freed them. Someone else would have eventually, sure, but still. They could kill anyone in their way, guns apparently didn’t work on them, and they were breeding.

We kept our frozen position on that couch for hours until everyone arrived. After that, it all feels like one long sleepless dream. The company couldn’t have this out, so I guess some deals were made, because the next day the cops were reporting that a machine accident had taken out all the watchmen together in the office—all but me and Leonard.

I was in no state to perform, my best bandmate Mule was gone, and so my music career was certainly not high on my priorities. Besides, with all the stress and lack of sleep, I could barely think as they shoved papers and NDAs under my nose. I could lose my job, or I could take a serious pay raise on the other side of the country. I don’t know if it was the right decision, and I don’t know if going back on my word and posting this is either. But I still don’t want some suit deciding I’m not worth the risk and snuffing me out. Hopefully, this post protects against that.

I’m not sure where life is taking me now, but at least it’s away from that town, with those things. Maybe this all amounts to nothing but the death of a few good men—my good friends—but maybe those things are multiplying.

If they are, then be ready to hide.

1ojmkmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Lost-Manner5574/comments/1ojmkmn/how_to_rebuild_a_las_vegas_brand_after_a_pr/,How to Rebuild a Las Vegas Brand After a PR Disaster (and Come Back Stronger),"Let’s be real — when a business in Las Vegas (or anywhere, really) takes a public-relations hit, it can feel like the brand’s reputation is permanently scarred. Whether it’s a social-media blowup, a bad news article, or a flood of negative reviews, the aftermath can impact **trust, search rankings, and revenue** all at once.

But here’s the good news: rebuilding a brand after a PR disaster is absolutely possible — if you understand how **SEO**, **Online Reputation Management (ORM)**, **Digital PR**, and **Positive Branding** work together. Think of them as the four pillars of recovery.

Below is a breakdown of how to systematically rebuild digital trust, reputation, and visibility after things go wrong — written for business owners, marketers, and PR professionals who want to do it right.

# 1. Step One: Accept, Audit, and Assess

Before you rebuild, you have to **measure the damage** — not just emotionally, but digitally.

Run a full **Google audit** on your brand name and associated keywords. Search the following:

* Your business name
* Your business name + “reviews”
* Your business name + “scam,” “complaints,” “lawsuit,” or “ripoff”
* Key executives or owners’ names

Open every result on **pages 1–3** of Google (because yes, people do click that far when there’s drama). Note which results are:

* Negative or inaccurate
* Neutral or controllable
* Positive or brand-owned

This creates your *reputation map*. The goal of the next steps is to **push negative results down** while **flooding the web with positive, credible, optimized content**.

# 2. SEO: Rebuilding Your Digital Real Estate

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) isn’t just about ranking for keywords like “Las Vegas coffee shop” — it’s also about **controlling your narrative**.

When someone Googles your name after a PR disaster, the search results become your new homepage. SEO is how you take it back.

**Here’s how to use SEO strategically:**

**a. Own your brand keywords again.**  
Re-optimize your website, social-media bios, and press materials for branded search phrases (e.g., “Your Business Las Vegas,” “YourBusiness.com reviews”). The goal: make sure Google sees *your* site as the most authoritative result for your own name.

**b. Create new content ecosystems.**  
Publish educational, useful, locally optimized blog content that naturally earns links and engagement. For example:

* “How We’re Improving \[Industry\] Standards in Las Vegas”
* “Community Partnerships We’re Proud Of”
* “Behind the Scenes: Our Updated Sustainability Practices”

This new content helps Google associate your brand with expertise and community value — not controversy.

**c. Build backlinks strategically.**  
Earn backlinks from **local Las Vegas media**, tourism blogs, or industry associations. Backlinks signal trust and authority to Google. The more trusted sites that link to you, the more positive pages will outrank older, negative press.

# 3. ORM: Online Reputation Management — The Shield and the Sword

While SEO builds your digital footprint, **ORM** defends it. ORM is a mix of technical strategy and psychology — it’s about **controlling what people find and how they feel when they find it**.

Key ORM tactics after a PR event:

**a. Create and optimize multiple digital assets.**  
Google gives high authority to platforms like:

* LinkedIn
* YouTube
* Medium
* Crunchbase
* Yelp
* Google Business Profile
* Local news outlets

By optimizing profiles on these sites with consistent branding, updated bios, and fresh content, you occupy more search real estate — pushing negative links down.

**b. Generate new, authentic reviews.**  
Never fake reviews. Instead, build a **legitimate review-response system**:

* Ask satisfied customers for honest feedback.
* Respond publicly and calmly to negative reviews.
* Highlight resolved issues and gratitude for constructive criticism.

This transparency builds credibility — and Google increasingly favors active, engaged profiles over ignored ones.

**c. Monitor continuously.**  
Set up Google Alerts for your brand name, executives, and product names. ORM is ongoing. You can’t fix a reputation once and forget it — you have to maintain it. The faster you spot new mentions, the faster you can respond constructively.

# 4. Digital PR: Rewriting the Narrative

Once your SEO and ORM foundations are set, **digital PR** becomes your offensive play. It’s not about covering up what happened — it’s about **changing the story** through legitimate, earned media.

**a. Identify new, positive story angles.**  
Ask: *What’s genuinely new, improved, or different since the crisis?*

* Did you change leadership?
* Launch a new community program?
* Improve customer service protocols?
* Support a local Las Vegas charity or event?

Frame these updates as newsworthy, not self-congratulatory. Journalists appreciate accountability, progress, and human stories more than PR spin.

**b. Pitch to credible outlets.**  
Reach out to **local media** (Las Vegas Review-Journal, 8NewsNow, KTNV, Vegas Magazine) and **industry blogs**. Provide clear, transparent updates about what’s changed and how you’ve improved operations.

**c. Use digital press releases for SEO.**  
Distribute optimized press releases (through services like PRWeb or EIN Presswire). Include your brand name and city in the headline and meta description — e.g., “Local Las Vegas \[Industry\] Business Launches New Community Initiative.”

Each release adds new, high-authority results to Google’s index, slowly replacing outdated stories.

# 5. Positive Branding: The Long Game

Positive branding is where emotional repair happens. Even if your SEO and PR work perfectly, people won’t truly trust you again until they feel something new about your brand.

**Here’s how to rebuild that emotional equity:**

**a. Focus on transparency and humility.**  
Post genuine updates on your website and social channels. Share what you’ve learned, what you’ve changed, and how you’re moving forward. People forgive honesty; they punish spin.

**b. Reinvest in community.**  
Las Vegas is a community-driven city — partnerships, sponsorships, and visible acts of goodwill go a long way. Support local nonprofits, arts events, or sustainability efforts. Document your involvement with authenticity (photos, blog updates, or short videos).

**c. Leverage storytelling.**  
Humanize your brand. Instead of hiding behind corporate language, highlight your people. Feature employees, share behind-the-scenes moments, celebrate customer success stories. Every authentic story online creates another positive page in search results.

**d. Visual rebranding (optional).**  
Sometimes, a PR disaster is an opportunity to evolve visually — refreshed logo, new brand palette, updated mission statement. But this should come *after* foundational repairs, not as a smokescreen. A new look should represent real progress.

# 6. Putting It All Together

Here’s how SEO, ORM, digital PR, and positive branding interlock:

|Element|Role in Recovery|Outcome|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**SEO**|Builds and optimizes digital assets for branded searches|Pushes negative results down and reclaims online visibility|
|**ORM**|Manages existing online mentions and reviews|Prevents new issues and builds trust|
|**Digital PR**|Creates new positive press and link authority|Rewrites the public narrative|
|**Positive Branding**|Restores emotional connection|Converts awareness back into loyalty|

When combined strategically, these systems form a **self-reinforcing feedback loop**.  
Good SEO supports ORM. ORM supports PR outreach. PR builds backlinks that strengthen SEO. Positive branding gives all of them authenticity and staying power.

# 7. The Timeframe and Expectation Reset

A realistic reputation rebuild usually takes **6–18 months**, depending on:

* Severity of the incident
* Domain authority of negative coverage
* Consistency of new content creation

But if you stay consistent — posting monthly blogs, issuing quarterly press updates, engaging locally, and actively monitoring search results — you can turn even a serious PR disaster into a long-term credibility win.

Rebuilding after a public-relations meltdown isn’t about pretending the past never happened. It’s about showing that you *learned, improved, and evolved*. In Las Vegas, where brands live or die by perception, owning your narrative through smart digital strategy isn’t just survival — it’s transformation.

You can’t erase the internet, but you can *outgrow* it.

I am a 25 year old male supporting my girlfriend through schooling while working full time and things have been pretty stressful as you might expect. I’ve been in crypto since 2019 and bought into bitcoin ($300) for the first time in 2019. Unfortunately sold that as I really didn’t know much about what I had even bought as I was 17 years old and hearing about people getting rich lol. 

Well, something similar happened to me recently and it has caused me to completely think about many things differently. 

I got into trading meme coins…. Ugh I know. Listen, there are people that can do this professionally and properly and PNL their way up to 100xs and can handle that type of risk management. I definitely CANNOT. And I’ve come to the acceptance that I might never be. And that is OKAY. It was hard seeing so many influencers saying “you are right around the corner” and drawing me back in until I had enough with revenge trading and just gave up on it. 

Man I felt stupid. I had wasted $500 on quite possibly some of the stupidest digital assets money can buy. I lost sleep from this. How could I be so foolish? How could I have lost so much control? How could I risk so much in pursuit of greed? 

I know in the world of trading, 500 might be an entry for some people. For me it just hurt. I felt pushed back in being a good future provider, money management and thinking I had control. I felt like I had nobody to talk to that would understand.

I then started looking back into Bitcoin. I know this sounds like the stupidest thing I could do after what felt like such a heavy loss for me, but for me… it just showed me how broken fiat is… I understood something, financial stability doesn’t come from sweating over absurd parabolic charts, or quickness, or greed. It comes from planing, planting seeds, patience, and being 
resourceful.

I fully believe, as long as the internet is around, Bitcoin will be a literal golden asset. As we see the middle class slowly die, I feel like the future higher wealthier class will be making big deals through Bitcoin, and the rest of the population will be moving to stable DeFi like coins as an adoption of the official currency. It just makes simple sense. And I see it with the rich and their recent attitude towards crypto as a whole. Bitcoin is limited. Bitcoin is simply genius.

Some of you might be rolling your eyes at me, either because I sound nuts, or I’m late to the party. But I’ve started treating the fiat I own differently. If I don’t get a coffee in the morning, I buy Bitcoin. Any money given to me 
For birthdays or Christmas, Bitcoin. Bonuses at work Bitcoin. I’ve started keeping a physical journal of every single Bitcoin purchase I make, the date and the price. To keep track of time periods, to keep my spending in check and to look back on. I’m working on getting 3 separate physical cold wallets and spreading my asset in case if anything happens but at the end of the day I have a really really really positive outlook on this and I really really think this is it. I think this is the asset that sets us up all for a few generations. 

Trading meme coins might have been the stupidest, genius, ridiculous, expensive way to get on this path I’m currently on, but it has given me more optimism, hope, and healthy habits for me and my girlfriends future. 

I’m buying and NEVER selling. 

Love you all and I’m so stoked to be apart of this with you guys.

A few years ago, I didn’t think I’d ever recover.  
The mornings blurred into nights, and guilt came disguised as “I’m fine.”  
Deep down, I knew something had to change—before I lost everything that actually mattered.  

That’s when I walked into addiction counseling for the first time, clutching a paper cup of coffee and a lot of fear.  
What happened next didn’t just help me heal—it gave me my life back.  

So yeah, *this is why I wrote* **Addiction Counseling: A Path to Recovery and Healing** — because if I could find a way back, I believe others can, too.

### What Counseling Really Taught Me (that no one told me before)
- **Recovery isn’t a straight road.** It’s a messy, zig-zag journey full of “two steps forward, one step back.” Progress hides in the tiny wins you barely notice.  
- **Willpower isn’t enough — connection is.** I used to think being strong meant doing it alone. Wrong. Real strength comes from admitting you need others.  
- **You can’t heal what you don’t face.** My counselor once said, “Denial protects you… until it destroys you.” That line changed how I saw honesty — not as weakness, but survival.  

---

### Why I Wrote the Guide
After my one-year milestone, people started asking *how* I did it — what worked, what didn’t, and how to actually stay on track. I wanted to answer those questions in one place, without sugarcoating the pain or glamorizing the process.  

Inside **Addiction Counseling: A Path to Recovery and Healing**, I go deep into:  
- Building a personalized recovery plan that *actually fits your life*  
- Rewiring self-talk and breaking emotional dependency cycles  
- Finding counselors who won’t waste your time  

It’s raw, practical, and straight from lived experience — not theory.

I made this guide to remind people that healing is human — and yes, it’s possible.

Using a throwaway for privacy, but I'm so lost and would like to ask for outside perspective.

I, and my fiancé, have been together for 4 years. We are engaged. For most of that time, he has been the most amazing, loving partner I could have asked for. I truly believed he was my person.

However, things started to unravel after we got engaged, which also coincided with a very stressful health / life event. During an argument, he called me really horrible, degrading names.  This had never happened before (I'd also never called him out of his name) so I was shocked and was ready to leave him as I found this behaviour to be unhealthy. He profusely apologized, said he was really stressedand promised he would never do it again, he didn't know it would hurt my feelings as badly as it did. He did it again a few months later but I forgave it. The final straw that led to our initial breakup was when I discovered he had a muted chat with a woman whose name I had never heard before. I say this because we are very open about each other's friends (or so I thought) and spend a lot of time in each other's friend groups so this was very odd for me. I know I was wrong, but I looked. Just to preface that I'd never searched his phone before despite us knowing each others passwords. He'd forgotten his phone at home and the friend he was supposed to meet with texted him, and I wanted to respond with a message that he left his phone at home but decided against it, however when closing this notification is when I saw the chat with the woman. Some messages were deleted, it was clear they had been meeting up without me knowing. He had never mentioned her to me, while I was always open about all my friends, introduced him to all of them and encouraged that they get to know each other, and always let him know when I was meeting them and where.

When he arrived home, I first apologised for the violation of privacy. I genuinely felt really bad for doing this because I didn't want him to lose trust in me, after which I confronted him about the messages, which at first he  refused to explain because I had violated his privacy. The next day, he admitted she had sent him explicit photos, which he claims he told her to never do again. But he continued to meet her privately, claiming it was innocent because he ""wasn't interested"" and he didn't ask for the explicit photos despite me mentioning that this behaviour coming from a ""friend"" was grounds to end a relationship, and that he crossed a relationship boundary by not cutting her off or distancing himself from her for disrespecting our relationship. He mentioned having few childhood friends (which apparently she was) so having those longer relationships meant something to him.

After that, we separated for 2 months. It was awful for me and him. He was apparently so depressed he couldn't eat or sleep, lost a lot of weight, and I took that as a sign of how much he loved and missed me. When we decided to reconcile, I made a point of us being completely honest about what we did during the break. I told him I went on 1 date, to be transparent. Nothing happened on this date but talking. No hug, no kiss, no sex, nothing intimate, basically a coffee interview. I asked him he had been with anyone and he said no.

Fast forward to last week, I met up with our mutual friend and found out that this was a lie. He did sleep with someone else during that period, in fact met with her repeatedly. When I confronted him, he denied it. Instead, he accused me of telling him about my date just to ""make him jealous"" and serve my agenda.

I am completely shattered. The man I trusted 100% has lied to me and I don't know how to face him. I don't mind that he had sex with someone else as we were broken up at the time. The issue is that the trust is just gone. He says he loves me and wants to make it work, and a part of me desperately wants to believe we can go back to how we were in the beginning. But I look at him now and I just see the lies.

So, people of Reddit, I need your blunt honesty:

- What would lead a man to do this to someone he claims to love? The name-calling, the secret meetings, the lies?
- Is this fixable at all? Can we mend the trust over time? 

Any insight, especially from those who have been in similar situations, would be so appreciated.

TL;DR: fiancé called me names, secretly met a woman who sent him nudes, and then lied about sleeping with someone during our 2 month-long breakup. He wants to stay together, but my trust is shattered. I don't know what to do.",1,1761786553.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

Hold up. You still have the chocolate bar. Put it in a zip lock and pound the hell out of it.  You want crumbles.  So now you have crumbles, Half in bottom of pie shell.  Pour in mix. Spread generously the top of pie with whipped topping.  Top artistically with remainder of chocolate crumbles. Put in fridge for at least an hour. I made this the other day using all WM great value brands.  It was decadent, rich, good and pretty.  I will be making this again soon.",1,1761786542.0,inflation,0,0.67,False
1ojmdhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1ojmdhi/seeking_advice_on_becoming_a_barista/,Seeking advice on becoming a barista.,"Hi all! 

I recently decided to make the jump, going from customer service to.. you guessed it, being a barista!

Roughly a year ago (probably closer to 9 months ago), I started making my own coffee at home, and then I started getting serious about it. I use a Ranchilio Silvia, for reference. I've been pulling decent to good shots for the past couple of months, and have the process down to muscle memory now. I am familiar with the dialing-in process, and understand how to adjust the different elements in order to maintain a consistent 1:2 ratio and without bittering my espresso. I have issues with milk steaming, which I only started doing a couple of weeks ago, but have been consistently improving. 

All of that being said, I've found a lot of joy and peace in the process. I enjoy the entire experience, love making drinks for friends/family, and love coffee (if you couldn't tell). I am very well versed in the customer service world and will have no problems with customers and having to handle the public. 

The biggest hurdle I have been facing, and what I am seeking advice on, is where do I start? I'm 19 and have worked in the customer service industry for nearly 3 years (in retail and small privately owned companies), so while I do have experience in this field, I have no food service experience and no barista experience. There is no shortage of coffee shops in my greater area, and a good majority of them are hiring. However, I've been turned away a great many times simply because I have no formal prior experience. So, where do I get the experience needed to start this career path? 

This is something I do really want to pursue, and have been privately working towards for nearly a year now to no avail.

*Any* tips, suggestions, or advice you may have is more than appreciated. TIA! 🤍",0,1761786506.0,barista,8,0.5,False

Never expected, always appreciated ❣️ (P.S. if you’re having trouble getting to the “checkout” page, you might need to turn off content blockers on your phone.)",3,1761786442.0,Minneapolis,0,0.72,False
