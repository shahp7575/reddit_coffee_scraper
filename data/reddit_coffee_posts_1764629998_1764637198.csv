1pbuji1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusFinance/comments/1pbuji1/starting_a_coffee_trailer_business/,Starting a coffee trailer business,"Does anyone have any experience or any resources they could share that would help me gather information on what costs I could expect to start a coffee trailer business? Also what sort of things are a must to get started? 

I know I can likely expect a trailer to cost around 20k and the machine alone is probably a couple grand.

I’m hoping in the future to secure a lease at a set location but also sell at local markets, but I’ve got no idea the cost of that. 

Am I going to struggle to get a personal loan to fund some parts of this if I’ve got no idea what revenue will be like? I could fund it, but I’ll be draining savings to do so. What are my options? 

Thanks in advance! Hopefully this is the right place for this question.

1pbugyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/sobervegans/comments/1pbugyo/what_does_sobriety_mean_to_you/,What does sobriety mean to you?,"TLDR; I’m curious what does sobriety mean to you personally, and does it connect back to your veganism in any way?

I’ve struggled with this concept for a long time and I realized it means very different things to different people.
When someone says they’re “sober,” I used to assume it meant they just don’t drink anymore. But outside of California I’ve noticed a lot more people use the term to mean complete abstinence. Some people still drink coffee and some don’t. Some smoke nicotine and others avoid it. Some don’t drink but will occasionally use other substances ect… There’s no single definition and it makes it really hard to figure out what sobriety even means for me.

I know some sober vegans are here for health reasons, some for ethical or addiction reasons, and a lot for a mix of both. I actually started my sobriety and veganism journeys around the same time, within two months of each other. Both were part of a bigger moment where it felt like the rose-colored contact lenses finally came off and I saw how messed up everything was, including myself. I also became a feminist and a leftist around that time, it was a full paradigm shift.

Personally, I smoke weed, probably too much, but it doesn’t destroy my life, body or bank account anywhere near the way alcohol or my DOC, benzos, do. If I try and make sober friends it’s hard to tell who’s gonna not be okay with me smoking and I never want to say I do it and have that trigger someone into thinking if I can do it they can do it and have them end up ruining their lives or dying. All my friends are drinkers and that’s part of the reason I haven’t cut alcohol out. But just because they drink doesn’t mean I should, just because it’s a social lubricant it pulls me in, like none of my friends are vegan but when we go out to eat, I’m not gonna like eat chicken and ranch. Everytime I tell myself I’m sober and then slip and drink, I feel like I failed and then I avoid trying again!",1,1764636873.0,sobervegans,0,1.0,False

I’m 32, single, and hoping to connect with someone around a similar age. I produce my own music and have been doing that for the past few years. Recently I have gotten into coding with the assistance of AI to develop intelligent accessibility scripts to increase speech feedback for screen reader users in the music production program Reaper, which has been a very exciting journey for me as I am someone who is Blind. 
I enjoy swimming, bowling, rock climbing, and traveling. I also love learning new things—lately I’ve been diving into meteorology, sociology, and psychology.

I’m looking for someone who enjoys great conversation and going out for meals, to places like cafes, restaurants, and lounges. I don’t drink and would much prefer either chats in coffee shops, lounges, restaurants rather than a night out on the town. 

I identify as asexual (or somewhere on that spectrum), so I’m more focused on emotional and romantic connection than anything physical. If you’re the same—or just value deep connection—I’d love to chat. 

I’ve never let being blind stop me from living fully. 

I’m open to chatting with people from anywhere especially from the UK, US  Europe, and even further afield such as places like Australia and seeing how things develop. Europe, especially the UK is best for time zone compatibility, but again, I don’t mind chatting to people from anywhere.

I’m a 36-year-old guy from New England, and like a lot of people here, I’ve never been in a relationship. It wasn’t for lack of trying — shyness, bad timing, and life just kept getting in the way. But I’ve been working on myself, opening up more socially, and I’m genuinely ready to connect with someone.

A bit about me:
Firstly I have some sort of fame, if thats what you call it. I made a dating site promoting my singleness DatingKen, which caught news in Boston and Matt Sheer a reporter social media. I’m a huge nerd who loves conventions, gaming, and cosplay. It’s been an amazing community for me, and I’ve met some great friends through it. I cosplay characters like Eddie Munson from Stranger Things and Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and oddly enough, I’m freakishly lucky with raffles and giveaways (no clue why, but I’ll take it).

I’m looking for someone kind, patient, and down-to-earth. You don’t need to cosplay — just be someone who enjoys nerdy stuff or at least doesn’t mind it. I’m not expecting perfection; I just want a genuine connection with someone who understands what it’s like to navigate dating later than most.

If you’re local, maybe we could start with something simple like coffee. No pressure — just two people seeing if there’s a spark.

Just some observations and reflections.","**Context:** Probably 5 years ago I started on 2mg nicotine gum, then moved to 4mg when I stopped feeling the buzz. Eventually moved to Zyns, making my way up to a whole can of 12mg pouches every couple days. A few months ago I realised that the only Zyn I actually enjoyed was the first of the day, with my morning coffee. The rest of them I just took to chase away the craving. 

At some point I started getting acid reflux which could be seriously painful at times, which I foolishly treated with antacids for years. This has cleared up instantly upon quitting the Zyns. 

I'll spare you the details, but my sex drive has gone absolutely crazy, like... I don't even belong in public. I'm guessing this will taper off, but I'm enjoying it honestly. At least it takes my mind off any cravings. 

Anyway, the thing I actually wanted to mention is that **Zyns stopped me from smiling.** 

I don't see it mentioned here, but I found that I wasn't smiling as much, or as widely, because I was afraid it would reveal the Zyn in my lip. I have countless candid photos where I'm smiling without teeth because I didn't have enough time to prepare my mouth to smile.

I certainly think there's something damaging to the spirit about developing a facial habit of controlling and limiting one's smile. I noticed this when I had braces as a teen: training myself not to smile felt like training myself to whisper all the time or something. A small thing which compressed my presence and made me more self-conscious.  
  
Among all the other benefits I've found since quitting, this feels like a big bonus. It's really nice to have ""mouth freedom"".  ",1,1764636828.0,QuittingZyn,0,1.0,False

1pbue9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/PwC/comments/1pbue9d/are_you_searching_ultimate_perfection_of_life/,are you searching ultimate perfection of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",0,1764636673.0,PwC,0,0.5,False

I get that not everyone has a massive budget for expensive gifts. No one’s asking for sports car or whatever limited edition high end branded bags either.

However; recently I have a friend who I’ve observed in the last few years or so seemingly liked to gift people cheap things. By cheap I mean really really cheap things that probably don’t even cost 50cents to begin with. One of the gifts she gave me for an early Christmas present is a plastic pearl wrist bracelet I think is meant for kids under 10yo. You can tell not just by the cheap plastic it’s made of but also how small it is. Mind you I’m an adult in my 30s so why am I still getting gifts like this when I have no kids of my own?

On top of that she’s given me a small daily planner booklet that looks like it’s given for free from some out of nowhere unknown store and you still can see the store’s beefy logo on it.

My initial reaction was that I was shocked I was given something like that. I was surprised for someone like her who earns close to B$3000 she’s gifting cheap stuffs like this. Honestly I get that Brunei don’t have a lot of things to get as gifts for anyone. But from what I can see she is just gifting items she got for free from a store to her friends just so she can get rid of it without throwing it away and feel guilty about it. 

Mind you - I’ve bought her some gifts when I went to Malaysia to visit and got her one of the better branded journals from MPH and a local Malaysian branded coffee. Heck even those cost more than the dinghy gifts she got for free and gave it away. Even if it’s bought in MYR - convert it back to BND it costs more than the gifts she gave. I’m actually gobsmacked at the gifts she gave it’s like it may as well not be gifted in the first place. 

I get that it’s the thought that counts but does it really warrant getting gifts that’s given for free by stores? Or the fact that it seems like it’s a bracelet meant for kids and was gifted just because her kids or nieces don’t want it?

So what do you guys think of gifting gifts that’s too cheap?",0,1764636601.0,nasikatok,0,0.5,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I’m a 36-year-old guy from New England, and like a lot of people here, I’ve never been in a relationship. It wasn’t for lack of trying — shyness, bad timing, and life just kept getting in the way. But I’ve been working on myself, opening up more socially, and I’m genuinely ready to connect with someone.

A bit about me:
Firstly I have some sort of fame, if thats what you call it. I made a dating site promoting my singleness DatingKen.com which caught news in Boston and Matt Sheer a reporter social media. I’m a huge nerd who loves conventions, gaming, and cosplay. It’s been an amazing community for me, and I’ve met some great friends through it. I cosplay characters like Eddie Munson from Stranger Things and Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and oddly enough, I’m freakishly lucky with raffles and giveaways (no clue why, but I’ll take it).

I’m looking for someone kind, patient, and down-to-earth. You don’t need to cosplay — just be someone who enjoys nerdy stuff or at least doesn’t mind it. I’m not expecting perfection; I just want a genuine connection with someone who understands what it’s like to navigate dating later than most.

If you’re local, maybe we could start with something simple like coffee. No pressure — just two people seeing if there’s a spark.

It’s a legit coffee shop, just really small and only open on weekends. We’ll be doing espresso drinks + drip, but I’m trying to keep the setup compact.

Before I jump straight into full commercial gear, I’m curious:

Are there any prosumer/home espresso machines or grinders that can realistically handle light shop use? Something with good temp stability, solid steaming, and not super finicky for part-time staff.

I don’t know what my shot volume will look like yet, but it won’t be crazy high. Just trying to figure out whether machines in the “Linea Mini/Micra + solid grinder” category can hang in a micro-café, or if that’s wishful thinking.

If anyone has run a cart/kiosk/pop-up with prosumer gear, I’d love to hear what held up, what didn’t, and what you’d actually recommend.

Budget is somewhat unknown, but it’s an incubator so not crazy.

1pbua4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1pbua4z/im_thinking_about_divorcing_the_good_guy/,I’m thinking about divorcing the “good guy”,"I (26F) married my husband (32M) a little over a year ago, and we have been together for 6 years in total. My husband is a great guy and I am not going to deny that. He is caring and loving (to a degree), but I have never felt more alone in my life.

I will be completely honest and say that my husband helps out around the house more than I do. He does majority of the cooking and cleaning/laundry. Everyone in my personal life tells me how much I should appreciate having a husband that does this, and I do! But what a lot of people do not realize is that I work longer hours than him. I leave before him each morning, and I arrive home after him each and every single day. If I got home the time he did I would have dinner ready and waiting for him. I even tried to change my hours at work so I could get home earlier but they would not allow me to. And to be completely honest, we could not afford the pay cut as I make majority of our income. There have been a lot of things recently that I can’t get over. He knows how important holidays and celebrations are to me. I received nothing for valentine’s day and for my birthday this year. Technically he got me flowers for valentine’s day but had them delivered to me over a week before as ordering them on Valentines day was “just too much”. Last christmas he returned all my gifts as he got me the wrong size in clothing. I would like to mention that I have been the same size in clothing since we started dating 6 years ago. And he still continues to get me the wrong size in clothes.

I told him how I have dreams for myself to continue my education and get a higher degree so we can have more stability in our life and hope to start a family one day. He has always been encouraging of me to continue my education but is very quick to say how without my income we “could not survive”. I have encouraged him so many times to look into other facilities and jobs as he could easily make a lot more money. At the end of the day he is unwilling to leave his current job as he is “comfortable” there. I even remember talking to him about having kids and how I would like to stay home for 6 months to 1 year and not go back to work right away after 6 or 12 weeks. His exact response was “well I don’t know how that would be possible. We just can’t make that work”. I have busted my butt, taking on second jobs, budgeting every week, and cutting back on things for myself to be able to get him the things he wants. And in return he can’t even entertain the idea of looking for a better paying job or supporting his wife/future family? This past year we have been battling with infertility and I have been poked and prodded every single month for blood work, scans and medical appointments. I make sure to eat healthy, exercise daily (if I can), and take the recommended supplements. He has not once come to any of the appointments with me, and trying to get him to take a daily multivitamin is like forcing a kid to eat their vegetables.

Honestly, the most heartbreaking thing happened this week. I get extremely sick during ovulation and with my menstrual cycle. Normally I have very bad cramping but this past month I had pretty extreme nausea and vomiting. One night after eating dinner I started to feel poorly so I excused myself and went to bathroom. I ended up in there for hours throwing up and unable to move. My husband took forever to check on me, and once he did He brought me juice (while I was actively vomiting) and asked if we were still going to have sex that night to try for a kid. I just said no and asked him to just leave me be. There was no checking to make sure I was okay, no holding my hair for me or asking to take me to the doctors, no nothing. He was more worried about still being able to attend his friends event the next day so I ended up taking myself to urgent care.

He thinks bringing me an iced coffee is “love enough” and while I appreciate the gesture I need more. I need quality time with my partner, I need him there for me when I am sick, I need to know I can count on him to provide for us if something were to happened and I just can’t. I have always been so quick to put myself last, not worry about my needs/wants. And when it comes to my husband, I just feel like I am always his last thought. I can’t even remember the last time he took a picture of me or us. He never posted about our engagement or marriage and he knows how hard it is for me dealing with infertility and whenever I need his help he is not there. I have had numerous talks with him over the last few months about how I feel and what I need from him in the marriage and he says he will change but nothing ever does. There’s no cheating, there’s no lying, but I can’t continue to beg a man to love me the way I need to be loved. Or beg him to simply be there for me when I need him. I take my vows very seriously but I am quickly becoming miserable and am losing myself in this marriage. I don’t know what to do.

Capitalism monetizes every lack and every need. Including mine. And capitalism abuses people for my needs to be met. It’s a never-ending cycle of hurt and abuse. 

Yesterday I had a bit of a panic attack due to this thought. 

I want to buy new clothes. I’ve tried thrifting before and I simply don’t like it (I think how, no matter what, a person suffered while they made the garment of clothing I’m trying on). Even if I get new clothes, a person suffered/was abused in the process. It literally pains me, I feel dizzy/nauseous, and like a monster for wanting things, because I know that they cost suffering. 

I know I’m not 100% responsible for the capitalism and how the system I was born into is set up. That being said, I’m partially responsible and compliant whenever I buy something. 

It doesn’t matter what I buy or what I do: if I buy coffee at a local shop, I’m not being sustainable by getting coffee on a plastic cup and the workers there are not being paid enough; if I buy from a specific food brand, I’m giving money to a company that wants to privatize water. 

Like, I’m painfully aware of what it costs me to function in the system, if that makes sense? And how my actions impact the planet. Yet I know that my actions barely make a difference, millions of people need to organize so we can all make a collective change.

The most simple solution would be to grow my own food, make my own clothes, etc. And I really want to someday, but right now I’m very young and I’m still getting my education and trying to make my way in the world, by also being affected by capitalism: I study and work, I barely sleep, I need coffee and clothes to feel a little bit better emotionally, etc. 

That’s it. I think that my anxiety only multiplies the effect my actions have, but I could also be right and the world/system is like my mind says or even worse and no matter what, I’m inherently evil for wanting things. I feel so much guilt and pressure to be ethical, and I do boycott several brands, but I feel like it’ll never be enough. 

I also want to clarify that I don’t want to justify spending money on questionable/unethical brands/companies. I’d much rather wear literal rags than buy and wear brand-new clothes knowing that the person/people that made my clothes are being abused just so I can have something to wear. But yeah. Every single thing I own or have ever owned probably cost human suffering. This makes me feel so horrible. ",2,1764636270.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,0.75,False

I started journaling after each date — not for anyone else, just to make sense of my patterns, and blind spots.

What surprised me was how many men around me were going through the same things but never talking about them. It feels as a male we are not allowed to have a voice or talk about the negative aspects of people we have been on a date with.

I ended up turning these journal entries into a longer piece about dating as a man today — the awkwardness, the humour, the genuine fear, and the vulnerability. I am not a writer,  It’s not polished and is probably pretty ordinary but I though why not, i dont hear much about others guys dating lives. From being stalked, to someone saying they would accuse me of SA if i didn't sleep with them....its been a wild ride. Some very cool dates in there too though.

Happy to share parts of it here if anyone’s interested, or just chat about dating after separation, co-parenting, attachment patterns, or the ridiculous chaos of being a grown adult asking strangers if they’d like to grab a coffee.

1pbu7hw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1pbu7hw/dismissive_avoidant_ex_rebounded/,Dismissive Avoidant Ex Rebounded,"Hey guys! I've recently gone through my first breakup with my DA ex back in August. I'm (24M), and she's (31F). I'm an anxious attachment style person and that has gotten the best of me post breakup. I thought to stay as friends with my ex since I couldn't imagine a life without her. We kept talking for the first couple days of the breakup then she started to truly pull away. Few days after the breakup she straight up told me that talking to her as often as I am won't help either of us get over the breakup. I took this into consideration, heart broken and kept thinking about the mistakes I've done over and over again. I will admit, the relationship ended primarily due to me, while she had issues too, I had bigger problems that I didn't address that would relate to our age gap. Not to mention it was my first ever relationship so I was scared to bring up concerns and set boundaries to emotionally invest. I wasn't putting enough effort to make my future more financially secure and kept doing the same old life routine, getting me nowhere.

I was obsessive in nature as I kept scanning her socials, looking for a clue MAYBE she will take me back, I was very very desperate. She ended up streaming for the first time on Twitch in months and I ended up tuning in out of curiosity. I never chatted or anything but I noticed some guy typed in her chat for the first time but it seems to me they were acquainted with each other in the past. The guy knew what her discord was so that was the obvious telltale sign that I should ""worry"" about this guy. Later on, I'm almost certain that they ended up starting a relationship together and I found this out just 4 days ago cause my idiotic self decided to call her to check up on her and ask her to coffee or food to catch up. I also know this because they seemed close when they played games together on her stream which made me go into extreme panic mode. I discovered that the guy she rebounded to is only 1-2 years older than me so the worry of the age gap between us suddenly means nothing? I just have a feeling she threw away her standards and attached to the first guy that slid into her DMs in a self destructive manner.

This phone call I made tripped me up, she was very firm on saying that she's not interested in talking to me and that she's dating someone new. After she said that, there was a few seconds of silence. She then asked, ""How have you been feeling?"" I kept my composure and said that I was doing okay. She responded with ""Good, please don't contact me ever again."" and then we said our farewells and ended the call. The reason this trips me up days later is that she sounded like she was holding back tears after she mentioned she was dating someone new. Another thing to mention that is WEIRD to me is that she's paying for a Duolingo super family plan on my behalf. She hasn't kicked me off the plan even though it takes less than 10 seconds to do so, and as of today, she unfollowed me on that cause the app forcibly started a friend quest between us two for the second time, my response was to unfollow back. (this was so awkward LOL).

Our relationship lasted 15 months, and we talked for 10 months beforehand for hours on end almost everyday. I know she misses me but it's not my call to reach out to her. I held on to no contact for 2.5 months as the last interaction was me giving her belongings from my house back, which initiated from me reaching out 2 days prior to ask for a heart to heart conversation between us (I hate myself for this one). I love and miss her every single day. I want her to be happy but I hate to see her destroy her self esteem and ruin her chances of getting what she wants in life, as she wants to settle down and start a family before 35. The fact that she rebounded so quickly tells me that she didn't try to get over me, she's holding in those emotions and I have a feeling that me calling her started letting those emotions out. I would think calling was a terrible idea but it gave me so much information I needed to know about the situation to understand the picture. I want her back first and foremost but that's not my decision, that's her's and its her life. She changed my life for the better and yes there were some negatives in the relationship, but they were outweighed by the positives. She can date whoever she wants but I'm just afraid she doesn't understand her emotions after the research I've done on attachment styles. As of right now, I've been improving my life heavily for the past 3 months and I am going to hold firm on no contact. If the universe decides she will reach out, then I will respond.

Anyone else have stories to share about their dismissive ex? Or any thoughts on my story? Responses greatly appreciated!

\*EDIT\* She did not monkey branch or had this guy lined up. I was with her the night before the breakup happened and never noticed the guys' name in her DM history list. I'm pretty sure them talking to each other is a pure coincidence. She did emotionally start to pull away 3 months prior to the breakup. ",2,1764636189.0,AvoidantBreakUps,1,1.0,False

Hey everyone! I’m a 33 year old born and raised in Michigan, hoping to meet some new people to talk with, vibe with, and hopefully build some easy, real friendships.

A bit about me:
• I’m all about the outdoors during the spring, summer, and fall hiking, kayaking, camping, you name it.
• Winter turns me into a cozy homebody who loves reading, binging shows, drinking way too much coffee, and leaning into all the comfy vibes.
• Personality wise, I’m friendly, laid back, sarcastic, and definitely get sillier the more comfortable I am with someone.

I’m open to chatting with anyone as long as the conversation flows and the energy is right. If you want someone to talk to during odd hours, share hobbies with, swap random thoughts, or just laugh about life, feel free to send a message.",1,1764635953.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

1pbtzkr,https://i.redd.it/i8q4g1snro4g1.jpeg,Offering to Papa Legba,"Hello everyone, I’m looking for some advice. I’ve been studying Vodou for over almost 2 years now, taking my time to make sure that I’m being as respectful and careful as possible. I stumbled across a video last year of a woman named Eve the Medium (who has practiced in 21 Divisions and Haitian Vodou for decades) presenting a video on a service that non-initiates can offer to Papa Legba. As far as I know, she has not made videos on offerings to any other lwa bc she says that can dangerous if you’re not initiated, which I respect. In the video, she said we could offer hot chocolate or strong black coffee, candy, a brown candle, and a cigar, and an image if we want to visualize him more. That’s what she told us to do so that’s what I’ve done, nothing more nothing less. I also give honor to the lwa by giving thanks to Danballah and Ayida Wedo on Sunday, Papa Legba on Mondays, Petwo Nasyon Tuesdays, Nago Wednesdays, Rada Thursdays, Kouzen Zaka Fridays, and Ghede Saturdays. Other than to Papa Legba, I don’t make offerings to any of these lwa or nations of lwa but I do set out candles and things that represent them on these corresponding days. 

When I pray to Legba, I really don’t ask for anything other than for my path into the religion to be opened. I know I haven’t been this for long and I need to be patient but I think my doubts are maybe starting to get to me. I once prayed that he would help me get the money to get an eskot reading, and in his cup of hot chocolate I thought I saw a mermaid figure. Today I saw what looked like a river. I don’t even know if the spirits communicate like that so I take it with a VERY light grain of salt, and even if they do I don’t know what these symbols would mean. It’s difficult bc I haven’t found any lakous in the LA area or houngans or mambos. There’s only one that and my experience with that person was not great, so it’s difficult to get any guidance or clarification on these things. I do feel like I’ve experienced some blessings: I once was doing a service to Legba and telling him about my struggles with work, and I felt like he was guiding me speak to Kouzen Zaka about it. I prayed to Zaka and the next week I got another job that was totally unexpected. On Halloween, I was trying to put my costume together and was feeling discouraged bc I couldn’t find one of the items I needed for it. I kept feeling a pull to pray to Ghede about it. I sat down, lit a candle, and explained what was going on. As soon as I blew out the candle I IMMEDIATELY found it, and I hadn’t been able to find it for months up to that point. All this to say, I don’t have an houngan or manbo that I trust so it’s very difficult to get guidance and wisdom on any of this, and I don’t want to be delusional or mess myself over.

Getting to see the office and meet my team was amazing, but it's like a 70/30 split between men and women, and no one wears makeup! I expected that, but damn. I was wearing a slightly toned down version of my normal look (a plum lip, light pink eyeshadow with a clear shimmer, brown mascara, and some light blush) and I still felt like I stuck out like a sore thumb. For reference, I rolled up to class a couple weeks ago in a deep purple lip and a red smoky eye topped with a blue duo chrome. 

For the last week or so, I've been trying to do more professional/minimal makeup, and I'm BORED. I got a matte mauve lippie and a purply-neutral eyeshadow quad. They're fun and all, but I miss glitter and lip gloss. I feel like I've become a corporate shell of myself even though I haven't even started my internship yet. One of my friends literally asked if I was okay the other day because she almost never sees me without a bold lip. 

It's a dumb thing to worry about, but I'm seriously losing my mind trying to look professional while not feeling like an alternate version of myself who studies accounting or something and drinks black coffee is staring at me in the mirror. She is me, but I'm not here.

I'm at the airport waiting in line for a coffee and I hear a dog yelping in pain. Apparently some dog owner managed to get their dog caught in the escalator.

People were crowding around the top of the escalator to see what was wrong. The escalator was shut down. An airport employee had to come over and help free the dog. One woman was crying over the dog. 

Newsflash nutters: Don't let your dog run around the airport. This is not a dog park! 

Before my plane took off, I was imagining the dog owner calling whomever she was flying to meet to tell them she wasn't going to make it because her poor dog got caught in the escalator and she had to go to the emergency vet. Smdh. ",18,1764635438.0,Dogfree,4,1.0,False

“Peak Ocean State culture: swear at you while handing you a coffee, call you an idiot while fixing your brakes for free, roast your entire existence in public but defend you to death if another state talks shit, distrust every politician but trust your cousin’s boyfriend’s cousin because “he’s a good guy,” hate authority because every mayor, councilman, and uncle’s friend has been indicted since 1978, and have 400 opinions all loud and all contradictory, but deep down still be fiercely loyal. It’s the same energy as “What are ya, stupid?”, “Come here, let me help you,” “Don’t ever ask me again,” and “What do you need?” Rhode Islanders are blunt, chaotic, defensive, jaded, helpful, and weirdly soft-hearted all at the same time, and the distrust of authority is earned—RI political history is literally indicted, arrested, resigned, re-elected, repeat. So when someone shows up with accurate information or official-sounding facts, the instinct is, “Nahhhhhh get outta here.” But when someone from here actually needs help, the same people will show up at your door with a shovel, a casserole, and a Bluetooth speaker blasting music from 2003. It’s a unique kind of loyalty, a weird, loud, abrasive love.”

I’m hoping to get some advice on the value of a **first-generation Saddleback Leather suitcase** — the original **Old World / classic suitcase-style version** in **Coffee**. This is the early design that collectors still talk about, and it’s become pretty hard to find, especially in this condition.

# Condition

* **100% original**
* **Coffee color**
* **First-generation build** (thicker leather, older hardware style)
* **Still has the original leather tags**
* **Never used — genuinely perfect condition**
* Minimal scratches (I think), no patina, or marks since it’s been stored safely for years

I know these early-production Saddleback pieces have a bit of a cult following, and I’d love for this to go to someone who truly appreciates what it is — the quality, the craftsmanship, and the history of the brand’s early years.

# Why I’m selling

I’m only selling it to help fund my daughter’s college education. Otherwise I would absolutely keep it — this is one of those “forever items” you don’t see come up very often.

# What I’m looking for

* **Value** for a first-gen suitcase in this condition
* Whether recent sales of similar pieces exist
* Recommendations on **where to list** this so real collectors will see it (Reddit, Facebook groups, classifieds, leather communities, vintage luggage collectors, etc.)
* And of course, if anyone here is a Saddleback collector and wants to discuss — I’d be happy to chat.

Thanks in advance to anyone who can offer guidance. I’d love for this piece to end up with someone who will appreciate it as much as I did.

1pbto47,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1pbto47/excellence_coral_playa_mujeres_review_november_25/,Excellence Coral Playa Mujeres Review November '25 Trip,"Hello everyone! My husband and I just got back from a 6 day trip to Excellence CPM and I had promised to share my experience so here it is. I'm gonna keep it short and straight to the point.

After an extensive search, calls and emails, I realized there were too many good options out there but we made the best choice by staying at this resort and here's why:

  
1- Good food options here, booking reservations is very easy (you do it first day of arrival right after checking in with the help of the concierge). Food was actually delicious at most places and it exceeded our expectations. Freshness was super important for me since I'm pregnant and I still found it easy to eat whatever I wanted any time.

2- The staff are so nice (or at least try to be). We were greeted very well from day one to last day. Some staff were really nice that we already miss them!

3- The resort was accommodating to our needs. When we needed a hospitality room due to our late flight after checking out from our room they provided us a room.

4- The spa was amazing, Maybe a bit more on the more expensive side but considering the type of resort it is, we found out worth it.

5- We were able to schedule a last minute photo session with Irais at the resort, she was also very nice and talented! We love the photos.

6- The rooms were spacious, clean, and modern.

7- The 24/7 Room service to order food was very helpful for us since restaurants mostly closed at 10pm and our reservations were mostly earlier.

8- The main pool was heated and clean, we didn't even swim at the other 2 pools dedicated for the excellence club guests (which are smaller and one of them wasn't heated). They had poolside food service which we used  every day.

9- Activities got nicer on days leading to Thanksgiving. Before that there was no show of any kind on the weekend. We really enjoyed the water aerobics.

10- Their app is really nice and helpful to find food spots and decide what to do/eat every day. I like that they even mentioned dress codes for each restaurants.

11- It was very easy to find chairs by the pool.I was worried about this due to the chair game happening and AI resorts, but we found good spots every day.

12- Their coffee shop was amazing, and the chocolate shop right next to it had really delicious samples you could try everyday.

13- The beach was so pretty and getting chairs there was easy too. They also have food service. There was still some seaweed but they cleaned it everyday along with the pools.

14- Wide spaces to chill and hangout of you just want to relax outside the pool.

15- Generally, it was a calm and serene vibe. The resort everywhere had a luxurious vibe, everything being new and clean.

  
Cons:

1- Food service at the rooms was 24:7 but it was very slow. It took about an hour every day. (weekday or weekend alike) so order early! it's not the best food taste or quality you will see here though.

2- The resort was always quiet but the staff made loud noises. dragging stuff, talking loudly at the corridors at early morning hours that woke us up from our sleep.

3- Bed and pillows wasn't the best but we asked for other pillow options and they provided.

4- Complementary airport shuttle is provided by the resort only if purchased directly fromn their website. We used a third party so we had to get out own shuttle.

5- Not all restaurants were tasty or had great customer service, but trying a different place every day will cater to different tastes and is part of the fun!

  
The staff told me it gets busier around Easter there when the weather would be even hotter. During our stay thanksgiving week, the weather was ready nice though. perfect temperature to chill and tan without overheating.

I will add more points as they pop up in my head but overall we had an amazing experience and I highly recommend this resort. If you are looking for a place to mostly relax this is the place for you. If you want a party resort this isn't for you. Hope this helps!

I’m 24F and hoping to make a few new female friends in Brisbane. Most of my current friends have moved away or are super busy, so I’d really love to meet some chill, drama-free girls to spend time with.

A bit about me:
• Big gamer – always down for a casual gaming session or trying something new
• Love brunch/coffee dates and checking out new cafés
• Enjoy shopping, exploring the city, or just having a low-key hangout
• Pretty introverted but friendly once I warm up
• In a relationship — so if you’re also coupled up, cute double dates could be fun! But absolutely not a requirement at all

1pbtkb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrossdressingStories/comments/1pbtkb1/getting_hit_on_while_running_errands/,Getting hit on while running errands,"I thought it might be fun to share some highlights that came from being out and about as a woman while I ran a few errands. 

My [outfit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Crossdressing_support/comments/1pbp6ra/felt_like_a_chic_suburban_housewife_running/).

It's truly thrilling, surreal and sometimes emasculating experiencing the role reversal. First, I stopped at a gas station and a very masculine blue collar guy was walking out of the convenience store. He saw me and called over: ""Your husband should be out here pumping that gas for you."" I blushed and gave him a polite smile. 

I went inside the convenience store to grab a drink and as I was coming out of the aisle I almost cut a man in line who was waiting to pay but then he waved me in front of him. ""After you pretty lady,"" he said. I knew he probably just wanted to stare at my behind, and I blushed again, but it was a thrill!

Then I went over to the mall to get my nails done at the salon where I had an appointment. I got french tips and while they came out a little bit too Carmella Soprano (IYKYK) I loved that they put me even more into a feminine headspace. I was enjoying walking around the mall in my tall boots and carrying a large purse over my shoulder. I felt really in my feminine energy and even did some browsing in a few clothing stores. 

One highlight was when I walked into H&M the young lady at the front table said: ""Nice boots, girl! Strut your stuff!"" That was very validating. 

After I left the mall I went over to Lowe's to return some Christmas lights and make an exchange. I was a bit nervous stepping into such a masculine environment. Of course the customer service kiosk was on the other side of the store. As I was passing an aisle a man pushing a cart of plywood said: ""Nice boots, honey."" 

It was kind of funny and thrilling how a few of the employees probably assumed I was some housewife who was completely out of her element and lost (which I was for half a moment trying to find the kiosk) and I was stopped a few times and asked if I needed help with anything. The irony here is when I was in buying the Christmas lights a week prior I couldn't find an associate if my life depended on it haha. 

After Lowe's I went to the nearby grocery store and was walking around with my hand basket. An older bearded man and I kept crossing paths while we were shopping, even doing the polite ""hi"" once we'd passed each other for the third time. Finally on the fifth pass he said, ""We really have to stop meeting like this."" I laughed and he responded with, ""Those are some great boots by the way. You look fantastic."" I blushed and I think said something about the added height they gave me and then we were both on our way. 

My last stop was at Starbucks. The drive-thru was backed up so I went inside and the line was still pretty long. Two guys got in line behind me and I could feel them checking me but then they quickly left due to the line not moving. Another guy replaced them and we ended up making small talk while we waited and he actually offered to pay for my coffee which was really sweet. 

Hope this was a fun read and let me know if you want me to share more!",2,1764634550.0,CrossdressingStories,1,1.0,False

1pbtj8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/1pbtj8c/update_no_buy_november/,Update: No Buy November,"This is an update to my [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/1omle5l/no_buy_november/?ref=share&ref_source=link) earlier about not buying anything in the month of November. My idea was specifically to avoid Black Friday purchases but also to be more mindful when buying Christmas gifts. Here's how it went. 

Here is everything I bought in November:

* 11/2/25: $328.84, BikeFlights. This is a shipping service for bicycles. I sold a bike and shipped it to Texas. 

* 11/6/25: $21.71, groceries.

* 11/6/25: $187.63, dining out. Two people. 

* 11/7/25: $50.89, DoorDash. Flying out the next day, didn't want to cook. 

* 11/8/25: $32.66, airport food. They really know how to get you. 

* 11/8/25: $127.55, groceries. Staying with family but they have terrible coffee and no snacks. 

* 11/10/25: $269.80, dining out. Six people. I paid for the bill and they sent me money. 

* 11/10/25: $586.16, Apple Store. Christmas gift for my dad. iPhone 16e. More thoughts on this purchase below. 

* 11/11/25: $196.17, bike shop. Got a flat tire and needed to replace the tube. Of course, then I noticed how bald the tires were so I decided to replace the tires as well. 

* 11/11/25: $129.66, Lowe's. Bug traps, cleaning supplies. Reimbursed by family. Prepping for some family events. 

* 11/11/25: $226.84, Target. New TV. We accidentally broke the TV in the guest room. 

* 11/13/25: $371.03, dining out. 8 people, family birthday so treated them to special dinner. Partially reimbursed from siblings. 

* 11/15/25: $90, dining out. Mexican food, paid for my sister as well. 

* 11/16/25: $41.09, airport food, snacks. 

* 11/16/25: $113.32, parking fees at airport. This was actually the cheapest option for a week parking. 

* 11/17/25: $66.66, Lowe's. Tool for a project, spare house key. Having a house sitter coming for the holidays, realized we don't have any spare keys. The tool was a very specific socket wrench size. Debated whether I needed to buy it vs try to borrow it but it's for a semi regular maintenance task that I'll do a few times a year. Saves me a trip to the bike shop to have them do it, which not only saves me repair costs twice a year but saves some time. 

* 11/17/25: $130.97, groceries. 

* 11/19/25: $51.64, groceries. Always forget something. 

* 11/24/25: $55.48, DoorDash. Didn't feel like cooking with Thanksgiving coming up. 

* 11/25/25: $216.40, Sur La Table. Gift to sister and brother in law. Combo birthday/Christmas gift. They both have December birthdays, so this kind of covered everything. 

* 11/25/25: $172.35, Amazon. Christmas gift for my brother. 

* 11/25/25: $100.27, wine and champagne for Thanksgiving. 

* 11/26/25: $255.70, groceries. Big Thanksgiving dinner shopping trip. 

* 11/26/25: $770, fancy dinner. Yes, I know. But it was worth it. More below. 


This was all of our purchases in November apart from stuff like cell phone bill, utilities, gas. And this was a concerted effort. We probably cut out some unnecessary purchases either consciously or otherwise, which was the point. At the same time there were some purchases that could be argued against. 

Some of the gifts you could say we failed. Yes, I know, we bought an iPhone for my dad. Up until a year ago he didn't even have a phone. He shared my mom's which was annoying for lots of reasons. He would go off to run errands and either forget stuff or we'd want to add things and there was no way to reach him. Or he would do what he always does, run into somebody he knew and it would be hours later and we'd have no idea where he was. He's getting older and we'd worry. So we as a family kind of forced him to get a cell phone. But he was using an old flip phone and always struggled with it. So, since the rest of the family has iPhones we got him one. The 16e seemed like the cheapest option to get in the door with a phone that could last a while. And he's familiar with iPhones since that is what my mom has. We also like that we can turn on share my location so when he wanders off or gets distracted we know he's ok. 

Other thoughts. The super expensive dinner was at a Michelin star restaurant we've been wanting to try for years. Totally expensive but it was amazing and totally worth it. 

The bike purchases I'm ok with because they replaced consumable items.

The TV replacement was annoying because it probably could have gone without replacing but I felt bad and don't like leaving things in worse conditions that starting. 


Overall, I'm happy with the challenge because I didn't buy anything on Black Friday, and overall we cut back heavily on our purchases. It really made us think about every purchase. There were more than a few times where I was close to buying something but decided not to when I took a hard look at whether I needed it. Makes me realize how many stupid and useless purchases I've made in the past. Were we perfect? No. But I'm ok with that because nobody is perfect. And as they say, perfect is the enemy of the good. We don't have to be perfect to cut back and reduce. We don't have to be perfect to do our part and stop buying stupid stuff. And realizing that being good is an overall net positive. 

We also ended the month in a net loss for stuff. Meaning, we donated or tossed way more stuff than we brought in. The total stuff bought for the month were 2 bicycle tires, 2 bicycle tubes, 1 spare key, 2 tools. We offloaded around 30 items. 

Edit: Broken down by category:

Total purchased: $3,741.42

Reimbursed: $754.98 

Gifts: $628.04

Total spent on me: $2,358.40

Groceries: $697.84

DoorDash: $106.37

Eating out: $1,304.07

Other: $328 to ship a full bicycle. One time thing to declutter. $196 on tires and tubes for bicycle. Can't really skip that once a year. $226 for a TV because we broke somebody's stuff, oops. $113 for parking fees at the airport. $66 for tools, spare keys.",3,1764634476.0,minimalism,2,0.71,False

I'm a woman who knows nothing of computers, and if you try to break down why one model is better than the other, it will likely go straight over my head, unless you explain it like you would to a child. I know, I'm not doing feminism any favors. I will work on becoming more technologically literate, eventually, but for right now, I have too much going on and I just desperately need to buy a serviceable laptop. I've been using a Lenovo Flex with impressively broken hinges and a battery that lasts literally 3 seconds unplugged. I'm honestly sort of amazed it still works. 

  
All I need is a decent enough laptop, for school and running software that school requires. I don't game, I don't care about brightness level (my eyes are sensitive anyways!), I don't care about size. Battery life of 1 hour plus would be awesome. I just need something that won't lag, will ideally last a few years, can download software (doesn't need to be a crazy amount) and I can transport, unlike the broke-ass laptop I currently have which cannot close beyond a 60 degree angle. 

  
Maximum price is about $450-600, though if there's a laptop that could meet my needs for the $200-$400 range, I'd be overjoyed. 

  
I don't need specific listings. Just the names of models that would still be a smart purchase in 2025, and won't become a pain to deal with in the next couple years. I know thinkpad is the way to go, as this is what my brother has told me, but in typical fashion, he refuses to say anything more helpful than that.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I’m hoping to get some advice on the value of a **first-generation Saddleback Leather suitcase** — the original **Old World / classic suitcase-style version** in **Coffee**. This is the early design that collectors still talk about, and it’s become pretty hard to find, especially in this condition.

# Condition

* **100% original**
* **Coffee color**
* **First-generation build** (thicker leather, older hardware style)
* **Still has the original leather tags**
* **Never used — genuinely perfect condition**
* Minimal scratches (I think), no patina, or marks since it’s been stored safely for years

I know these early-production Saddleback pieces have a bit of a cult following, and I’d love for this to go to someone who truly appreciates what it is — the quality, the craftsmanship, and the history of the brand’s early years.

# Why I’m selling

I’m only selling it to help fund my daughter’s college education. Otherwise I would absolutely keep it — this is one of those “forever items” you don’t see come up very often.

# What I’m looking for

* **Value** for a first-gen suitcase in this condition
* Whether recent sales of similar pieces exist
* Recommendations on **where to list** this so real collectors will see it (Reddit, Facebook groups, classifieds, leather communities, vintage luggage collectors, etc.)
* And of course, if anyone here is a Saddleback collector and wants to discuss — I’d be happy to chat.

Thanks in advance to anyone who can offer guidance. I’d love for this piece to end up with someone who will appreciate it as much as I did.

You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

Until one day, late at night in the dark and dreary neighbourhood she lived in. She heard a crash, a bang, the scraping of metal. 
She ran outside to see a biker, laid out on the floor, bike smashed to peices after slamming into the back of a parked car. 
She didnt know his face, why would she? Shed only been in town a few months.

It was ok but there's this sourish acidic taste that doesn't agree with my tummy. 

So if anyone can suggest INSTANT coffee (no premix as I don't take sugar/milk) that is less acidic with a decent amount of caffein, I'd appreciate it.

I've chased everything to get the highest extractions possible from lightly roasted coffees. I went through the whole gear rabbit hole, ending up with an Ode with SSP Brew Burrs and a ZP6 for my filter coffee. Got two Pulsars for no-bypass immersive percolation at work and at home. Make my own water and planning my day around going to the grocery store to mix another gallon. Every roaster from Passenger to Little Wolf to Sey got the same treatment: blasting with boiling water, WDT like I owed it money, grind as fine as possible without choking. And yet, even with the ZP6, I was missing this clarity that everyone is talking about. This juiciness. This tea-like separation of flavors. Every brew was full bodied but had this finish that was drying and harsh. What was I missing?

I lay in bed one night, fretting about how I would brew tomorrow morning's washed Ethiopian from Reykjavík Roasters. I'd been getting lovely milk chocolate and orange notes, but they haven't been hitting the jasmine and floral flavors that the bag promised. During my doom scrolling, I chanced across a recent video from Lance Hedrick about his daily coffee routine. Clicked the video, and saw that he was brewing an ultralight (Apollon's Gold) at.....92°C?! 😱😱😱 This felt blasphemous. But then I saw him take a sip. And his reaction....I dreamed about that reaction even after I fell asleep.

The next morning, I ran downstairs, took out my old V60, and ground the coffee at 4.0.on the ZP6, keeping everything the same about my normal V60 recipe except bringing my water temp down to 93°C. Every pour brought terror into my heart, as if I was desecrating this delicate coffee by making cold brew. But then, I smelled the carafe, and was hit with bergamot and jasmine. Black tea surrounded my nostrils along with the sweet smell of lemon rind. I poured a small amount into a tasting cup, swirled it, and took a cautious sip.

Black tea. Florals. Jasmine. Bergamot. Yellow and orange citrus dancing on my palate as if I was tasting great coffee again for the first time.

The point of this story being, I thought I had my process dialed in. And yesterday I tried something new and re-awoke my love for this hobby. High extractions are valid, but they aren't the only way. There's always something new to try, just go for it! For now. I will be happy with my new-found exploration of lower brew temperatures.

Like after the service, there is a snack time, sometimes a light lunch even,  and it is usually provided not by the church but by individual volunteers or groups. 

I think it is a great idea, but I stopped going and this is why.

The room has several large tables each seating about 8 people.  All the groups of people go in and save seats for their friends  so when someone like myself, a marginalized member, comes along, there is no place to sit.  I stopped by to tell someone something Sunday and I did not even sit down, but someone interrupted me and said  "" Oh you can't sit there""   like I would have ever tried.  

I get it. I am not either  Something enough for everyone there.  I get that.  The church is an exclusive club and I am not included.  I get that.  The church is made up of circles of friends and I am not in any of those circles.  I get that.   The Sign says ""The Episcopal church welcomes you"" but that ""You "" does not include ""Me""  I get that .  

This past Sunday was Advent 1    I go not to put up with the superior individuals around me, or to be reminded of my second class status, but because I love the high Eucharist and especially Advent.  

I will attend through Epiphany, then disappear until Advent 1 of next year.    And likely not be noticed or certainly, missed.

1pbsyye,https://www.reddit.com/r/OneStopCentre/comments/1pbsyye/your_ats_resume_template_isnt_a_golden_ticket_and/,Your ATS resume template isn’t a golden ticket — and it might be hurting you,"Every second post on job subs lately is about “ATS resumes” like they’re some secret cheat code.

Yes, ATS exists. Yes, you should avoid doing dumb things like putting your whole CV inside a JPEG.
But an ATS resume is not a golden ticket. And treating it like one can actually make your resume worse.

A few things people forget:

•Not every employer is using ATS.

Small businesses, hospitality, retail, trades, a lot of local roles… someone is literally opening a PDF or printed page and skimming it with a coffee in hand.
	
•Even when ATS is used, a human still makes the final call.

Most modern systems just parse text + make it searchable. If your layout is clean and your keywords are in normal sentences, it gets through.

•The “perfect ATS resume” can look awful to an actual person.

One font, zero white space, no hierarchy, no personality, walls of identical bullets… it might technically be “ATS-friendly” and still go straight to the “no” pile because it’s painful to read.

Think about who is behind the screen:

•A hotel or restaurant manager might actually prefer a resume with a photo and a bit of design, because hospitality is face-to-face and they’re skimming fast for vibe, experience and availability.

•A creative director looking for a designer doesn’t want a resume that looks like a tax form. They want to see taste and layout, not just ATS rules.

•A corporate recruiter with 300 applications for a grad role? Sure, here a plain ATS-style resume makes sense so it parses cleanly and is easy to search.

Instead of obsessing over “ATS resume templates”, it’s usually smarter to:

•Make sure your layout is clean and readable (clear headings, bullet points, normal fonts, no text hidden in graphics).

•Match the language of the job ad in your bullets and skills section, without keyword-stuffing.

•Show specific results (numbers, improvements, responsibilities) instead of filler like “hardworking team player”.

•	Adjust the style to the industry:

•	Hospitality / retail: short, visual, easy to skim, clear availability.

•	Corporate: simple structure, strong keywords, clear progression.

•	Creative: balance readability with some design so it doesn’t look like every generic ATS resume out there.


ATS is a tool, not a religion.

A “good ATS resume” is just: text the software can read + a story a human can understand quickly.

Curious what others think:

•	If you hire: how much do you actually care about strict “ATS resume” rules vs a resume that’s just clear and relevant?

•	Job seekers: have you had more success with ultra-minimal ATS layouts, or with resumes that are tailored to your industry (even if they bend the ATS “rules” a bit)?

1pbsvf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1pbsvf6/nonstationary_nontrees/,Non-Stationary Non-Trees,"Dr. White sat in his university office one late fall afternoon, contemplating the monstrous mass of conifers looming beyond the frosted windows. On his desk a mug of lukewarm coffee waited, untouched. Beside it a cardboard box was also filled to the brim, boasting White’s belongings.

One research paper was all it had taken. Within a month his reputation in the scientific community had been forever tarnished, prompting the school to swiftly sever its association with him lest their name get dragged through the mud. He didn’t blame them. His students wouldn’t have a grain of respect left for him regardless once they got wind of the debacle. In a way he was relieved, for no longer did he have to bear his colleagues snickering amongst themselves in the break room.

Still, outlandish though his claims were, White knew he was right.

He’d relocated to this obscure northerly shit-hole of a town deliberately a year ago, seeking to confirm his suspicions. The region was unique, as far as he’d been able to establish.

White stared at the trees. They rose together into the hazy sky like a wall, drained of their typical green shade.

This wasn’t any old forest. Satellite imagery spanning the last decade revealed it was changing, growing increasingly dense at the town’s border. Slowly shifting.

Migrating.

He grabbed his binoculars and focused on one particular conifer. The closest of them all, fully grown, hadn’t been there a mere month ago.

And it wasn’t a lone anomaly. The wood was crawling with them. Infested.

Only two species composed it.

1)Norway spruce

2)N/A

White’s discovery was rooted therein.

Through tedious observation, he had gleaned how to discriminate between real spruces, and things that masqueraded as them. Things that looked almost identical.

Almost.

Things that moved when no one was paying attention.

White lowered the binoculars. Whatever the hell they were, it certainly wasn’t fucking trees.

An opportunistic forest of non-stationary *non*-trees.

That’s what he’d called it.

By the time 4pm rolled around, the sun had already ducked away. The spruces’ shadows stretched out like dark tendrils towards the campus buildings.

Right on cue, White noticed Daniel outside, strutting towards the woodland. The fellow biology professor and pompous cunt who’d belittled him at lunch in front of other faculty staff, proclaimed him an embarrassment.

Daniel squinted up at White’s office and waved sarcastically, that smug face of his beaming away. He’d finished lecturing for the day, and was taking White up on his dare so as to further ridicule him.

*Go touch a tree after class if you’re such a know-it-all. You don’t have the balls!*

Daniel had taken the bait, and was now nearing the edge. A faint outline in the twilight, dwarfed by their towering silhouettes. They stood, eerily still despite the breeze.

White closed his eyes, afraid it wouldn’t work if he watched. It had to. In that moment, nothing else mattered in the world.

A gentle shiver traversed him.

(I'll include all the details about Ren's agency below, including how exclusive it is and how famous or talented you need to be to join.)","(Would your OC be interested in working at Ren's agency or doing an internship there?)

The True of the Heroes – Ren’s Agency (Official Description)

Ren’s agency, known worldwide as The True of the Heroes, is recognized as the most prestigious hero institution in Japan and one of only three elite complexes of its kind in the entire world. The headquarters occupies an entire skyscraper, reaching heights comparable to Tokyo’s tallest towers. It operates simultaneously as a command center, academy, fortress, and home for its heroes.

Main Infrastructure

Full-scale skyscraper
The building is designed to house more than fifty heroes permanently. Each resident has access to private dorms, common relaxation areas, and personalized security systems tailored to their Quirk.

Michelin-level dining hall
The agency features a dining area run by a world-renowned chef. All meals are balanced specifically for recovery, stamina, and training optimization. The dining hall is so famous that several hero schools request visits just to experience it.

Advanced gym and sports facility
Equipped with traditional weight rooms, combat simulators, reflex systems, and custom training gear. It is common to see Ren and Delta training here at sunrise.

Armored training field
A reinforced internal arena used for Quirk testing, controlled battles, and large-scale simulations. It is built to withstand Ren’s direct attacks without compromising the building.

Support division and tech workshop
A dedicated floor for inventors, engineers, and support specialists. They design hero equipment, suit upgrades, and non-lethal weaponry, capable of producing emergency prototypes in real time.

Specialized Areas

Strategy and briefing rooms for national and international operations

Recreation and lounge areas where heroes build bonds outside of missions

Hybrid cleaning system combining autonomous robots with human staff

Advanced internal security, featuring anti-intrusion sensors and high-tier defense protocols


Ren’s Office

Located at the highest point of the skyscraper, Ren’s office includes a unique launch platform designed for him —and occasionally Delta— to dive from above the clouds straight into the city whenever a mission begins. This feature has become a signature symbol of Ren’s heroic identity: direct, fast, and always present.

Identity of the Agency

The True of the Heroes is more than a headquarters. It is a living ecosystem where heroes train, collaborate, and rely on each other. The agency functions like a family, with Ren leading from the front lines rather than from behind a desk. It is not unusual to see him sharing coffee with visiting heroes or personally inviting trainees to join his night patrols, reinforcing the idea that true strength grows from unity.

The result is an agency with an unmatched reputation: demanding, elite, and yet built on trust, camaraderie, and purpose. 


How Famous or Exceptional Do You Need to Be to Join Ren’s Agency?

Ren’s agency, The True of the Heroes, is considered the most exclusive in Japan and one of only three elite hero complexes in the world. Getting in isn’t just difficult—it’s practically an honor reserved for a very limited elite.

Here’s a breakdown by levels:


---

1. For Students or Interns

This is the most accessible level, but still only prodigies qualify.

Requirements:

One of the top students at your hero school,

A Quirk with extraordinary potential,

Or demonstrated exceptional hero spirit in combat.


Ren usually selects only one or two interns per year. He looks for young heroes with that “inner fire” he recognizes immediately.

Hey everyone, I’ve come to reddit for some help, as a friend of mine has BPD. Recently it was both of ours birthdays, about a month apart, and I was O/S for my birthday so we didn’t catch up for it. I got back a week before hers, so on her actual birthday we caught up for dinner. 

Here’s the thing, I didn’t bring her a gift and she’s extremely upset about it. For context, we’re both 23F. She’s a friend, but not in my close circle. We catch up maybe once every 2-3 months for coffee. 

I had come back from my 6 week O/S trip broke af, which yes, was my choice to travel, so had gotten straight back into working heaps to build up some financial stability again. The day of our dinner I still hadn’t gotten to time to buy her a gift, but planned to stop by the florist and get her a nice bunch of flowers & a card on the way to dinner. 

My car broke down on my way home from work. And I had to be towed over an hour home, then had to borrow my partners car to get to dinner (public transport isn’t great in my area, 1 bus route every hour or so). Because of this I got home from work 1.5 hours late leaving me only just enough time to shower, get dressed and go to dinner. 

I apologised as soon as I saw her and said I’d drop by her house with her present asap. But she was off the entire dinner. I could tell. I messaged her after, apologising, and also thanking her for the gift she got me. 

A day later she messaged expressing how “hurt, upset & embarrassed” she was. Said “there is absolutely no excuse” to not get her anything and that “struggling with money isn’t a good enough reason, I’m struggling with money too”. Then proceeded to tell me “if I had of known my present wasn’t going to be matched in some way, I wouldn’t have bought you anything”

I have been so apologetic, as the last thing I wanted to do was upset her. I am an extremely giving person, and I know I’m a great friend. My first thought was that her outlook was quite selfish because you don’t give gifts just to get in return! But we both struggle with mental health, so I’ve approached the situation with a lot of empathy and compassion. 

My question is, does this seem like a reaction that may be due to her BPD? Or is she just being harsh? If any of my other friends reacted like this with such little empathy I wouldn’t be giving them as much compassion as I’m giving her, but I know she struggles w her Mental health. If any friend of mine didn’t get me a present, expressed they were struggling w money & had their car break down, I couldn’t care less! Presents don’t determine how much someone values your friendship, in my opinion. I really wasn’t expecting anything from her. But I guess everyone views these things differently? 


She’s now not responding to any of my messages, and I have a feeling she’s just going to ghost me. She’s done this before when I had to cancel a catch up last minute due to being sick, but came back months later wanting to see me again. 

Not that this really matters, but my meal/drink was $30 and hers was $68. I was happy to just split it down the middle instead of asking her to transfer me the exact amount etc. I’m always happy to do this even tho I always get cheaper food & I don’t drink alc, so it’s not like I’m a tight ass! 

Just lost at what to do or say! When I’ve already apologised so much for something I feel like I don’t need to apologise this much for? (Hope this makes sense🥲)

Thank you so much to anyone who’s taken the time to read. I respect & appreciate how difficult life with BPD must be, so any insights from fellow BPD’ers would be so appreciated, but not expected. I hope this post hasn’t come across insensitive 🩶",3,1764632446.0,BPD,0,1.0,False
1pbsoms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DHMIS/comments/1pbsoms/revisiting_dhmis_s2_3_years_later_the_mystery_box/,Revisiting DHMIS S2 3 years Later: The Mystery Box Philosophy,"To preface, I’ve been a fan of DHMIS for as long as I can remember. My cousin and I cosplayed as Paige & Tony for Halloween, I’ve made my own Red Guy costume (as I type this the head of which sits beside me on a nearby coffee table), and I’ve always been a big defender of the series. It’s charming, witty, and spooky in all the right ways, and as an aspiring artist, it’s a great series, both the original (which I’ll be referring to as S1), and the Channel 4 sequel series (which I’ll be referring to as S2).

Flash forward roughly 3 years after S2’s release, and I found the itch to rewatch S2, and after dissecting it further, DHMIS as a whole is incredibly emblematic of Director JJ Abrams’ infamous Mystery Box design philosophy. From both a bad and good perspective, just hear me out:

For those unaware, you’ve likely seen a JJ Abrams flick and not realized it. He’s the mind behind various thrillers like *Lost, Super 8,* the *Cloverfield* trilogy, and massive franchise films like 2009’s *Star Trek* and *Star Wars Episodes 7 & 9.* Whilst doing a TEDTalk, JJ Abrams spoke of his Mystery Box design philosophy, in which he recounts a story from his youth where he purchased a box of magic items, and to this day has never opened it, believing what’s inside the box isn’t anywhere near as interesting as what COULD be inside the box.

While this design philosophy sounds interesting in theory, it ends up coming off more like a half-assed attempt at explaining away an inability to answer questions. It’s sort of a running joke that JJ will retcon random shit in his movies, or just refuse to explain things. After rewatching DHMIS S2, I couldn’t help but feel like this design philosophy is front and center.

Let me reiterate, I love DHMIS. I wouldn’t be writing any of this if I wasn’t passionate about it, and I’m not trying to accuse Becky & Joe of being creatively bankrupt or anything, but doesn’t that philosophy sound **DEAD-ON** to how DHMIS handles it’s respective lore and world-building?

I think most have come to the conclusion that whatever lore DHMIS might have is, at the bare minimum, drastically different between S1 & S2 (to the point where most have agreed they just exist in separate continuities). On top of that, it refuses to really explain anything, with the creators instead insisting that **”All Theories are True!”**, and how they want us to come to our own conclusions regarding the show.

As interesting as this is, this just feels so hollow to me. The thing that sorta irks me the most about it is that it almost feels a tinge mean-spirited, or at the very least mocking to a degree. What’s the deal with Lesley? What’s with all the imagery involving death? Why are they stuck in this limbo of sorts? Why is Roy still involved? Why are “underground” creatures continuously mentioned? Why is June 20th?

Once again, this is less so me wanting answers, and more so I genuinely do not understand why they felt the need to go out of their way to pander to the lore-obsessed fans, if their endgame was to ultimately mock them with that final episode. Like it almost feels significantly more intentional than whatever Easter eggs were to be found in the original series, like the Roy cameos, the hidden rat stuff, or 6/19/55. Why push so hard on the Lesley stuff if they had zero intention to actually answer anything about it…?

I love DHMIS, but I can’t help but become more critical of it as I grow older. I can understand ambiguity and wanting your audience to develop different meanings from your work, but it’s pretty frustrating when your art has a very clear implication, yet you still want to say it’s up in the air.

Recruiters promise equality, inclusivity, and opportunity for all.  
But scroll their LinkedIn profiles and you’ll spot a pattern:
•	Perfect lighting.
•	Dazzling smiles.
•	Pictures fit for a fashion magazine, not a job portal.
Bios full of passion for connecting people, traveling, dogs…and caramel lattes.  
Somewhere hidden is a tiny note: “I help people find jobs.”
Are recruiters finding talent, or just swiping for dates?  
They start with, “Let’s catch up over coffee to know each other better,”  
then dive into relationship status and personal life.  
Job choices? Maybe later—if at all.  
These chats often end with a wine dinner and “great friendship.”
Hiring feels more like a rom-com than a resume review.
And what about the gender balance?  
Recruiter profiles skew heavily female.  
Is it because male LinkedIn users prefer chatting with charming, photogenic females?  
“Professional networking” or LinkedIn’s “networking with benefits”?

Bottom line: Back to business
Recruiters should lead with precise expertise,  
balanced gender representation via merit,

You basically have to act extremely hyped about the cars and pitch how amazing they are-constantly mentioning every feature with a big smile, making sure the manager sees you, and acting eager to take every customer on a test drive so they can
'feel the greatness' of the car. It's too much, and customers see right through that fakeness.

They also expect you to roll out a metaphorical red carpet for anyone who walks in and offer coffee or water immediately, even when people clearly don't want it. The culture really seems to expect you to devote your entire life to Tesla. Sorry, but I have a life outside of work. At times it honestly felt a little cult-ish.

I drive a V8 truck and don't plan on giving that up.

Incredibly fun game, lots of upgrades, and ways to play, each time played I learnt most. E.g. Bombs are incredibly powerful early on. I would suggest one play through Casually and then one play through for **Safest Rebel** (Don't die) and Fastest Rebel (complete in under 3hrs 30 mins) as a second run. It was nice playing the game to enjoy, and then testing myself on a speedy / no die run. One of the better incremental style games I have played. Very very active game, not really an idle or a clicker game. 

\------------------------------------------------------------

**Incoming Standard AI Slop below:**   
  
Astro Prospector is an incremental bullet‑hell game that fuses resource mining with chaotic space combat, praised for its originality and addictive progression.

\- Resource mining: Harvest cofferoids and AstroCoffee seeds from hostile zones.  
\- Ship building: Outfit your vessel with weapons, utilities, and mods.  
\- Incremental progression: Automate systems, refine loadouts, and steadily grow stronger.  
\- Survival challenge: In the “Endless Coffee” update, survive 21 days, then push into endless mode for maximum synergies.  
  
✨ Features

\- 🌌 Corporate satire: Narrative centered on fighting SpaceCorp and reclaiming AstroCoffee.  
\- 🔄 Replayability: Survivors‑like roguelite mode with endless scaling.  
  
🌟 Reception  
Reception has been overwhelmingly positive:  
\- On Steam, 95% of nearly 1,000 reviews are positive, with players calling it one of their “top 3 incremental games of all time.”  
\- Fans praise the seamless blend of idle progression and bullet‑hell action, describing it as “the best of both worlds.”  
\- Criticism is minimal, mainly noting the steep learning curve and chaotic visuals, but overall the game is celebrated for its originality and addictive loop.

1pbsi17,https://www.reddit.com/r/hysterectomy/comments/1pbsi17/7dpo_notes_total_robotic_lapro_keeping_ovaries/,"7dpo notes! (total robotic lapro, keeping ovaries)","Hi all! Throwing my first week notes into the ring. I’m 11 dpo (11/20 surgery). I’m in the US, in California.



Total laparoscopic robotic da Vinci, keeping ovaries. 3 incisions, one on each side plus bb. Surgery was 2 hours, found multiple large fibroids and endo, which was a surprise to me! Also apparently one of the larger fibroids was blocking a portion of my colon and another had turned my cervix sideways! My angel of a surgeon who is also my OB told my wife in the post op call that my uterus was “gnarly” - which made me laugh and feel really validated! She is incredible and if anyone is looking for an OB in San Diego, pm me.



38, active previous to surgery (3x heavy weight training, 2x power Pilates or hot yoga, 10-15k steps a day).



Spent 1 hour in post and then wheeled home. No issues with pain other than period cramping, but the walk from the car was rough. Anthesia noted I am a barfy girl and gave me an extra med beforehand which I swear helped. I didn’t barf at all at any point this week, which is shocking for me.



1 - talked way too much but stayed lying down all day on oxy every 6 hours. No poop, tremendous gas pin despite MiraLAX and stool softeners.  Okay energy and no more period cramping, just a heavy feeling in the abdomen.



2 - sore/tight throat, barely able to speak - realize my anesthesia involved intubation. In bed all day feeling low, standing every 2 hours for 5ish minutes. Walked the hallway for 8 minutes. Tried to sit down to eat dinner and popped the glue in my belly button, which bled. Freaked out, showered and laid back down. Peppermint tea, uncrustables, jello were all that I could eat, and half a dry sandwich.



3 - stopped taking oxy and switched to only Advil for pain. Low energy and nausea still, taking zofran every 6 hours. Took many showers because poop finally happened.



4 - got too bold and ate taco meat. Mistake. Many showers, zofran, Gatorade and peppermint tea. Virtually no appetite but less pulling on incisions and no further issues with belly button. Overall just really low energy. Throat is all better.



5 - fed cats, made pasta, hourly house walks and lots of standing. Walked two blocks to get coffee, ear popped the whole time. Donut pillow and binder arrived. No laxatives.



6 - able to poop! Nauseous still and relying on zofran. No appetite but 1/2 pain scale. Super Ariana grande side to side pain today after washing my hair and doing some very very light surface cleaning. Ugh.



7- Thanksgiving, left the house and took 1590 steps, in and out of the car, was able to do light stovetop prep, at the end of the night felt burning but no tugging/pulling. Wore binder all day. Zofran and Advil helped but insomnia at night, probably from back sleep.





Overall, it’s been a smooth, unremarkable recovery and I have not had one ounce of guilt about going through the process. 



My MVPs that I haven’t seen mentioned in this thread recently: 



* mini pillows/mypillows as bolsters under my knees and to keep me on my back while I sleep



* High waisted cotton full coverage briefs underwear as a base layer, followed by the Velcro bandage wrap that others have mentioned. I didn’t own any and found I hated anything else I had.



* My appetite is totally torched which is a first for me and none of my normal foods (eggs, protein shakes) sound good at all. The uncrustables and pudding have been a big hit, and make me feel like I’m a kid :)



I’ll post another update at the one month to give anyone else updates who had similar stats to me! Best of luck to everyone going through this during the holidays, it takes a special kind of strength 🤗",6,1764631853.0,hysterectomy,1,1.0,False

My name is Jae, 46 female and I currently work as an Brand Specialist for a small company. I've been working there for 5 years now. Christmas is an absolute favorite season of mine and I love making handmade gifts especially hand-crafted ones. Think handmade jewelry, knitted scarves or homemade jams and spreads. I love giving something I made because it feels like it's more special and personal (like I can customize based on color or design or taste)

I have this co-worker, let's call her Ida whom I thought was a friend and normally would rave about the gift when I give them to her. This year, I got promoted one level up. I heard her in the pantry during coffee break talking with our receptionist. She said, ""Now that Jae got promoted, I hope she gives better gifts, not like the cheap tacky ones she normally makes. Last year she gave me crochet blanket she made, she could have bought something better at the mall. Such a waste of space, I gave it to the neighbors dog."" I felt hurt, I worked for months to carefully make those granny squares with 3D  flowers because she said she likes roses. 

This year, I was making mini-sun catchers for everyone made of Swarovski crystals, semi precious stones and wires. (i used to design jewelry for a living so I was able to buy materials at wholesale s and the promotion helped afford it) I chose everyone's with their birthstones. I decided not to make her one, it's expensive and too time consuming for something that she sees as tacky and cheap. Instead, I bought a 50 dollar gift certificate for her. 

Fast forward to the company year-end party, I distributed my gifts and went home early. By Monday, I went to the office and saw that some of my co-workers have their mini sun catchers hanging in their cubes or windows. It was like a rainbow. However, by afternoon, HR called me in because someone reported me for ""Discrimination and Bullying"".... Ida. She reported that i singled her out and that, everytime she sees my gifts to my other co-workers   she says she feels that she no longer belongs to the team, that it's an insult to her. 

I'm sorry that she feels that way but I felt that, I can chose who I could give my handmade gifts too. I feel bad, should I have just made her one to avoid all the drama? Am I in the wrong here?",0,1764631824.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,0.5,False

1pbsfwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver40/comments/1pbsfwz/how_to_regain_trust_after_an_emotionally_distant/,How to regain trust after an emotionally distant ex and put myself out there again?,"I was in a relationship for 9.5 months and we broke up in the very beginning of October. I ended it. He wasn’t a bad person, but being with him felt heavy in a way I never managed to shake off. There was this emotional darkness around him. Almost no lightness, almost no joy. Everything felt muted, like he was living life without any kind of warmth.

A big issue was his home and the dogs. He had two large dogs he loved, but he didn’t actually take care of them. They were never properly walked. They just went outside, pooped on the lawn, came back in, and that was it. Their paws were never washed. They were never bathed. So the whole house smelled like dirty dog.The floor was gritty. My throat felt irritated every time I was there. I felt constantly tense and uncomfortable in his space. When he stayed at my cleaner, calmer place, I always felt relief. My body was basically telling me that his environment was not a place I could ever feel grounded or safe.

On top of that, he was completely emotionally unavailable. He only liked talking about intellectual topics, work, theories, analysis. He acted like those were deep conversations, but they were all in the head. If I tried to talk about feelings, closeness, needs, fears, or anything about the relationship, he shut down instantly. He would say stuff like this is who I am or I like my life and I don’t want to change. If I offered any solution or compromise around dogs and life together (he offered me to move in with him many times), even small ones, he shut down. Every single time. It always turned into either you accept me as I am or we’re incompatible. That was his way of ending any emotional conversation.

Sex was also difficult. He never gave me oral, which made me feel like my pleasure didn’t matter to him at all. If I shared something I liked, he would say it wasn’t his style. He was very focused on BDSM, but in a disconnected, mechanical way. It didn’t feel intimate or playful or attuned. It felt cold and scripted. Sometimes I would tear up because I felt so unseen, and he never noticed because it felt like having sex with a robot.

Over time I felt myself shrinking. I felt like I had to adjust to his world but he never adjusted to mine. And even though I cared about him and liked certain parts of him, I could not picture a future where I would feel emotionally safe, seen, or fulfilled.

The reason it took me a while to break up with him was my empathy for him. I also have a strong appreciation for very accomplished men, and I tend to confuse discipline and structure with potential emotional safety and stability. He was an interesting person, and we had genuinely stimulating intellectual conversations, but that was basically all we had. Yet somehow, I felt so sorry for him that I think a part of me secretly hoped that if I just loved him enough, he would start opening up. I was trying to give him just a little more time. And then even more. And a few more weeks. But that was all false. It never happened. So I broke up with him after the last 2 months of a relationship negotiating with myself.

Since the breakup I’ve been healing. There are still sad days and flat days, but I know I made the right choice. I’ve been doing nice things again, starting to feel like myself, and sometimes people ask me out for coffee. I wasn’t ready before, but now I’m starting to think about saying yes. I want to believe there are men who are emotionally open, stable, warm, grounded, masculine in a healthy way.

My main question now is how to trust again? How to believe that emotionally available men exist, and how to spot them early while avoiding the ones who aren’t? This was too painful and I don't want to repeat it again. Any advice will be appreciated.",5,1764631705.0,AskWomenOver40,14,0.86,False
1pbsep5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BelleBetting/comments/1pbsep5/december_is_here_lets_make_it_our_cash_cow/,December Is Here — Let’s Make It Our Cash Cow 🐮💸,"Hey friends,



Happy Monday ☕️😌 I think I speak for all of us when I say: *I’m so glad December is finally here.*

 

I wanted to kick off the month with a little reflection. November was… a month. Comically, **I looked back at my spreadsheet from last year,** and wouldn’t you know it — November was the only ""Belle's Picks"" month that didn’t turn a profit in 2024. I’ll have updated spreadsheets and a trough of fun stats out later this week, but honestly? November being a tough sports betting month might be *a thing*. If Year 3 is also chaos, we’re calling it a tradition 😂

 

**For those of you who subscribed in November** — thank you for sticking it out. It was a roller coaster, but I appreciate you trusting the process and trusting me. **Even when sports decides to light itself on fire for a few weeks, this community always bounces back in spades** 😊

 

*Pick of the Day* felt the brunt of November’s wild energy. **To my “freemium” family:** I’ll do my best to get you back in the green and finish December nice and cozy 😉

 

Before I go, I *have* to mention that Broncos/Commanders game. As choked as I was that Denver didn’t cover, the game itself was insane. And I’m still salty about that PI call after Washington fully ""dropped the ball"" on 4th down in OT. Unreal. Lastly, going for that 2-pt conversion was BOLD… but at 3-8, I guess you’ve got nothing to lose 😂

 

Alright everyone — that’s all for now. **Today's takeaways:**

 

**1. Updated spreadsheets + fun stats** are coming this week, and

**2. Let’s leave November in the rear-view mirror and make December our cash cow.**

 

Cheers,

  
X

Wednesday offers a brief dry spell before Thursday's cold front punches through with snow showers and possible squalls.

I did not get to try leaves. I also brought my own coffee from home to make at the hotel since I did not have time to wait in long lines, take taxis to get coffee every morning, and no good coffee options that Tokyo Disney. I also recommend that you bring your own coffee if you need your fix every morning and afternoon.

Tokyo is also a good spot to stock up on Hario, Kalitta, Origami and otger Japanese Brewers. Same goes for the.Cafec and Kono filters. At least half the price of Amazon USA. You can buy all of this at Tokyo hands store.

I'm new to the game, I plan to open my Coffeeshop next year. 

I am starting to look for service providers for the espresso machine as well as the accessories necessary for a complete and functional setup. To give you a little context, I think we will make around 70 to 80 coffees per day with peaks at strategic times of the day.

The pro I spoke with this afternoon sent me two quotes after a long discussion about my needs. 

I have a budget of €18,000 max for my barista equipment but I would like to have the best value for money. I would like to keep some money for extras!

He offers me the Linea S or the Eagle Tempo with accessories to accompany my setup.

What do you think? What should I add to this setup? Need to have something very operational and reliable in the long term!

I'm listening to you!

I honesty posted on here not too long ago about how I was feeling at peace with my ex-gf decision to leaving me.. I was improving on myself and I felt that I was seeing some true growth... CONTEXT: This is how the story went.- also we were together probs 1.3yrs. It was official on Oct 16th, the night of the break-up we likely continued talking for about 2 hours+... It was during this conversation where my false hope blossomed. Couple of things that I remember as they are stand out and reinforce my hopeful thoughts 1.) I remember asking her if she will be looking to see knew people and her response to that was don't worry I know that if I see anyone that my chances with you are over... I said oh well what if you get horny and she responded with well how I am supposed to get horny without you in my life... Another key point was when I asked her if I should or when I should reach out again, I asked if I should just give up and and fully cut you out of if I should reach out- she did not explicitly she no... I asked how long I should wait and she said when you feel as though there has been enough change... OFC in the moment I never asked what that meant but in the time I expressed okay I will reach out in 21 days after building the foundation to my new habits and lifestyle... Now fast forward about 2 weeks it was absolutely no contact, but then I saw her at my gym and I stupidly went up to her a talk to her... Very casually talking about some funny stories you know she was laughing and smiling and stuff, and i ended up asking her If i should still reach out after 21 days. 

  
She once again said well if you think that its been long enough to see change... So ofc after that convo i had felt some increased level of hope.. I also starting going to a therapist right after the fact as It was clear that I finally needed to take time to deal with my severe mental health issues... I was talking to my therapist about if I was ready and if i should reach out or how I should reach out.... I concluded that I was ready to reach out despite it only being 21 days. I originally wanted to keep it super light with a hello and stuff to just feel out the vibes but my therapist insisted on not proceeding that way.. because it is a defence mechanism to maintain a level of control.. So i say hi, hope you've been doing good... The day has finally come, I am finally ready. Would you be open to having a conversation? 

Essentially a day later she responded with and incredibly blunt and clear message saying we've had many conversations about this, and the issues have continued... Shes want to focus on her self and she does see how she could maintain a good mental wellbeing while continuing our relationship. She said she doesn't understand how these patterns could've possibly changed in only 3 weeks. She made it clear that her decision was made and that she doesnt want to have another conversation and that it should be respected.. 

So about 2 days after that... I felt like I had so much stuff fully un explained, that i need to share to get off my chest and just have the ability to move forward. I decided to write out a 2 page letter, essentially taking full responsibility for what went wrong in our relationship, emphasizing how special she is, and how our relationship was inevitably not going to last.. I expressed deeply how these pattern are seemingly in place as a defense mechanism and what they are routed to. I emphasized that i respect her decision and completely agree that our past relationship need to end. Although i shared that our relationship in the past form is over and is never coming back.. I explain that our past relationship and the patterns i had were associated to the most pathetic and depressed version on myself. I said I will be slowly but quickly be eating away at that this version of myself until its a distant memory..  I then left it at that... I said best of luck and send the letter... After i sent it I right away blocked her because I was now feeling a peace and i did not the anxiety of know what she respond with or if she will respond... 

  
THIS IS WHERE I ALL GOES HORRIBLY-- Now again fast forward about 25 day to yesterday... I have been doing so much better, yesterday marked the 49th day in a row of going to the gym, eating better, meditating journaling and reading daily... I have fully rebuilt my habits, it also marked 2 months since i stopped smoking mj all together.... But then ofc i went to the gym and I saw her car in the parking lot and she was sitting in it... I made the stupid mistake of going to see her and say hi after my heart essentially dropped out of my chest.. Honestly the conversattion was fine very causual-ish... You know the how you've you been, you do a workout class, ect ect.. I then expressed oh man its so weird seeing you now, its so crazy how quickly we become strangers.. and her immediate reaction was well ya thats what happens when you stop talking...Completely dismissing my emotional comment and just being very blunt and factual... At the time I didnt think anything of it, it was really all fine.  Then i said okay i will see you around, drive safe and she said enjoy your workout... and that was it.... 

  
Then after my gym session after that conversation has fully consumed my mind I send her a text message at 8pm just say hey it was really great seeing you.... She ofc did not respond and this is where it all went to hell.... I was up till 4am just breaking up every aspect of our conversation... I came to the conclusion that her comment was actually quite painful as it implies we had nothing special going on in our relationship, and the whole connection was transactional in the sense that it was just created from us talking (which obvs true- but you know) ..... Anyways i had some major stressors today and then it continued to get worse and worse. It led to these irrational behaviours, I sent her a message at like 12PM asking if she would want coffee... she didn't respond and proceeded to send her like 10 other texts essentally begging for a conversation... I was begging her to block me and delete my number but she still didnt answer to i called and face timed her a ton of times... I am so embarresed and I've honestly every bit of my self worth becuase of it... I will so useless, un valued and just that our whole relationship was bs and fake to begin with... Like she couldnt even just block me like I asked so that I could escape that insane distressed and uncontrollable emotional loop.... I hate myself for now being able to control this, I feel like a failure, like I am worth nothing and her decisions are just reinforcing it... I have never felt so fucking horrible in my life

  
Essentially just blocked her and deleted her number as all of that... I fucking hate myself even more that ever before. Never felt worse since we broke up.... Its fucking brutal--- I dont know how to possibly move forward from this... ",1,1764630915.0,BreakUps,3,1.0,False

I noticed when I eat or drink, I feel a sensation around my sternum that makes me feel like I want to cough to relieve it. It's not painful, it's not a burning sensation, I can just feel something passing through which makes me want to cough. Also, sometimes when I breathe in hard, I feel that same tickle in the same area (after I eat or drink). Also I get what feels like a lump in my throat that goes away from drinking or swallowing or coughing liquid up. I'm going to the doc next week so I'll mention this stuff.

* Asking $1700 (very flexible)
* Duration: ASAP - Feb 28
* Room Dimensions: \~9.3' x \~10'
* UNFURNISHED private room w/ private bathroom w/ shower
* 2 mins walk to 2/5, 10 mins walk to B/Q
* In-Unit laundry
* Private wrap-around corner balcony
* Extra shared storage closet
* AC / mini split in each room
* Kitchen w/ island
* No dishwasher
* Currently being used as an office + storage (see pictures), this will of course be empty before move-in

The ideal roommate is someone who is clean, courteous towards others, comfortable in NYC (not new new). Examples of cleanliness requirements:

* No shoes in home (no exceptions)
* Cleans up after themselves
   * Ex: Dishes are cleaned immediately after use (loosely) unless soaking, etc
* Maintains general cleanliness of their spaces on regular frequency

You would be living with one other roommate (me) who is a 26 year old cis man who works from home (most days). I'm out of the house a lot, cook most of my meals and consider myself to be a very sociable person. Ideally, I'd love to be friends with my roommate -- perhaps finding the next best apartment together once this lease ends if the vibes are right.

1pbrzph,https://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/1pbrzph/why_people_pleasing_will_ruin_your_relationships/,Why people pleasing will ruin your relationships (I learned this the hard way),"I used to say yes to everything. Every request, every plan, every favor. I thought being agreeable would make people like me more.

Instead, I lost myself completely and watched my relationships fall apart one by one.

Here's the uncomfortable truth about people pleasing that nobody talks about:

You become invisible .When you never have opinions, preferences, or boundaries, people forget you exist. You're just the person who goes along with whatever. There's nothing interesting or memorable about you.

People lose respect for you. Deep down, everyone knows when someone has no backbone. They might use your niceness, but they don't respect it. Respect comes from knowing you'll stand up for what matters to you.

You attract the wrong people. Users, manipulators, and selfish people LOVE people pleasers. They can sense you won't say no. Meanwhile, healthy people get uncomfortable around someone with zero boundaries.

Your relationships become one-sided. You give everything, they take everything. Then you get resentful because ""you do so much for them"" but they never reciprocate. But you never asked them to—you just assumed they should.

Nobody knows the real you. How can someone love you if you never show them who you actually are? You're so busy being what you think they want that your real personality disappears.

You become exhausted and bitter. Saying yes when you mean no is emotionally draining. Eventually, you start resenting everyone for ""making"" you do things you chose to do.

How to break the cycle:

Start saying no to small things ""I can't grab coffee today"" or ""That movie isn't really my thing."" Practice with low-stakes situations first.

Express actual preferences like ""I'd prefer pizza over sushi"" or ""I'm not really into horror movies."" Let people know you have opinions.

Set tiny boundaries ""I don't check work emails after 8PM"" or ""I need 30 minutes to myself when I get home."" Start small and build up.

Stop apologizing for having needs ""I need to leave by 9"" not ""Sorry, I'm so lame but I have to leave early."" Your needs aren't an apology.

Some people will get upset when you stop people pleasing. Good. Those are the people who were only around because you were convenient.

The right people will respect you more for having boundaries. And you'll finally have space for relationships where you can be yourself.

Healthy relationships need two whole people, not one person and their shadow. That's my hard realization after years of people pleasing.",16,1764630574.0,motivation,1,0.91,False

Can’t seem to dial this one in either. Feels like I’ve tried everything - grinding super coarse, grinding super fine, 5 pours, 2 pours, pushing the extraction with longer brew times, higher/lower temps (anywhere from 89 to 95), more/less agitation, changing filters & seemingly every combination of these. Cups are either uninspiring or over extracted. Completely lost the baking spice notes that I had for maybe 2 brews (opened around 20 days after roast). 

At the end of the day it isn’t a huge deal, I’m just failing to see the side of this coffee that everyone’s such a huge fan of. On paper it sounds right up my alley, but probably my last time buying. 

Any similar experiences? Approaches you found worked well?

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

Welcome to the graduate students for the people sub. We want you to engage in your everyday life seeing how the challenges we face are alike to those faced by our neighbors and loved ones. Although having a research career in academia can be dreadful, we must challenge ourselves to be mindful of our surroundings and find opportunities to improve our livlihoods by helping others. Here we encourage academics to broaden their scope in research and apply what they have worked on to a world that can benefit us all. We also want to encourage formation of study groups, journal clubs, in the topics of labor, community building, and the history of liberation movements to better understand the world we live in today; a similar structure to book clubs like hoodbookworm.

Take this subreddit as an opportunity to share insights of what you believe a better world can be and how we as a community can live beyond the crippling C@p1it@l1$t we live in today. Use this sub as a pin board: There are many of us who would love to participate in work that empowers others, feel free. to share events/opportunites that do so. PLEASE be discreet as I don't want this sub to encourage any unneccesary violenece or harm, but events that focus in safety and tactics can be whispered (first project of our sub should focus in developing discreet forms of speech). Share zines, essays, journal entries of ones reflections, anything that encourages us to engage and challenge our world.

Based on the pic at the top of the article, it looks like a nice place for people to hang around OUTSIDE. Not a lot of cars to be seen:

But then you look at it from the satellite view and realize it's literally sitting right off of a giant (and no doubt unpleasantly loud and dangerous) stroad:

It makes me doubt whether people will actually be enjoying the outdoors at this new coffee joint as intended, or more likely, will be sheltering inside from the obnoxious car-oriented infrastructure right outside.

It's also telling that the promo material is trying its hardest to play up the human-friendly northeast side of the building and downplaying the human-hostile northwest side of the building where both the parking lot and stroad are located.

Us cyclists, are picky about almost everything. Saddles, bibs, even bar tape colours. So I put together a few things the were passed around as gifts in my family and the cycling club secret Santa.

**1. Gift card to a local bike shop**

It’s not personal, but it allows the recipient to pick whatever they like.

**2. Gift card to their usual coffee stop**

Cycling runs on caffeine. Nuff said.

**3. Fun cycling socks**

For some reason, cyclists are ridiculously picky about kit… except socks. My favourites have Teletubbies on them.

**4. Electric mini-pump**

Tiny lifesaver for roadside fixes. Xiaomi and Cycplus have been solid for me.

**5. Bike radar (Garmin/Wahoo)**

Honestly one of the best safety upgrades after a helmet.

**6. A professional bike fit**

It low-key says “I want you to enjoy this for a long time.”

**7. A cycling holiday / weekend away**

In my family we like gifting experiences instead of material gifts. Quiet roads, good food, new scenery, and precious time together.

1pbrs1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1pbrs1q/thinking_of_moving_back_to_the_us/,Thinking of moving back to the US.,"Hi everyone. I’m from Eastern Europe and I work as a lawyer here. On paper, my life is good — I have my own apartment, a nice car, a stable income, and a great husband. But honestly… everything feels gray and boring lately. I don’t feel inspired or excited about my life anymore. I catch myself not wanting to go anywhere or do anything. Even simple things that used to make me happy going out for coffee, seeing friends, planning small trips now just feel like chores. My days look exactly the same, and nothing new or positive seems to be happening. Winter makes it worse. Everything is dark, the city feels empty, and I feel like I’m just going through motions instead of actually living.

I lived in the US for 5 years (ages 19–24) and those were some of the happiest years of my life. I had to go back home because of COVID, and now 5 years later I’m wondering if I made a mistake. I can’t shake the feeling that I would have more opportunities and a more fulfilling life there.

Lately I’ve been thinking about moving to Florida. But I’m 30 now. Part of me wonders if it’s too late to start over. The other part of me feels like staying somewhere that makes me unhappy is the bigger risk. My husband is on board with moving to the US but he might protest if I actually say ""that's it pack your suitcase"".

Has anyone moved countries around 30? Is it worth trying again? How much money did should I have prior such move? How is the US and the economy since Covid? I would love to hear your experiences or advice.",4,1764630051.0,SameGrassButGreener,8,0.83,False

I’m looking at this recipe for apple syrup from the Ball canning book and it’s for pint jars. I would like to use 4oz (yes i know they’re small) jars to give away for Christmas. Should I still do 10min or would it ruin the syrup then since those jars are a lot smaller?

1pbrra2,https://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/1pbrra2/my_mom_decluttered_my_family_christmas_stuff/,My mom decluttered my family Christmas stuff,"I live in New York in a small apartment with a roommate. I have essentially zero storage space - I have a small closet and the area under my bed and one kitchen cabinet. I have a desk and a bed and a bookshelf. That’s all I own. I have to be VERY intentional about my belongings - if I buy something, I have to get rid of something - but on a day to day basis I’m fine with that.

However… I’m realizing how much of my minimalism was enabled by having the mental illusion of an entire other house elsewhere. My mom lives in the house I grew up in, which has a five bedroom house on two acres of land complete with a garage, a garden, a full kitchen with tons of appliances and storage space, etc. I have a bedroom there with a closet of stuff from high school and college, a shelf of old books from childhood, and so on. I usually visit for at least a few weeks every year and love the feeling of abundance and coziness I have when staying at this house.

This year my mom has decided to declutter. Rather than starting with things like cups and coffee mugs (she has dozens) she decided to start with 99% of my recently deceased father’s possessions. This was surprising and upsetting for me but I coincidentally came home in the middle of the process and managed to save a few things my sister and I really loved and sneak them into “my bedroom” in her house. (Edit: not that this is anyone’s business but I have asked her more than once if she’d like me to clean out this room and she has told me not to worry about it, since she literally does not use this entire floor of her house.)

Today I went to start getting out our family Christmas decorations. We’ve always had about two large boxes of ornaments, plus a tree skirt, lights, and some little things like a wreath and candle sticks. All of this took up one big shelf in a basement which is lined with shelves. I’d say it was 1/24th of the total storage space in the basement. A lot of the shelves are already empty and most of what’s down there is old tax paperwork, boxes for old appliances, rolls of garden fencing… just random junk. Out of allllllll of this low hanging fruit, my mom specifically only threw away the boxes of Christmas ornaments. Most of them were either handmade or bought while on family trips or belonged to my grandmother. I KNOW this is her house, I know all this stuff technically belonged to her… but these things were important enough to me that if she had told me she was throwing them away, I would have gotten a storage unit to save them. 

I’m just very sad about this and wanted to hear any insight/advice/perspective from other people who have dealt with this process. ",83,1764630002.0,declutter,50,0.88,False
