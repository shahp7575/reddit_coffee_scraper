Started having sex with each other over a year ago and from all that time I can say I like it. It's nice. He is a very open minded person, lovely approach, open conversations, would go down on me, didn't care much about body hair if I happened to leave some. 

It is just not worth it. He puts effort in too, buys most of our condoms and lube, shaves his face to not irritate my skin. I still feel like it's a lot of effort from my part. I hop in the shower, shave my legs, armpits, privates. Doll myself up. I take extra care of my feet cause he loves them. I went on contraception (vaginal ring) so I literally shove a foreign object up my body every month and let it stay there so we could be comfortable. I invite him into my home, and deal with the aftermath of hanging around my flatmates knowing we just hooked up. From all the activities my face is always irritated, sometimes my privates as well.

The activity itself is nice. But not worth it at all. He can get me off but not always so it's also a gamble of whether it will be fulfilling or end in me having to first communicate not being satisfied and then deal with the shitty feeling. It also takes so much time I would honestly just rather spend doing other things. It's kind of an equivalent of liking coffee shops but living in the country. Sure treating myself for a coffee would be nice but I'm not gonna spend an hour in the car and all that money for gas just to get it!

I'm not asexual. I used to have a very high sex drive for both activities, fantasizing and masturbation. It's only the latter recently and even that way, way less.

I'm not sure what to do about it, how to say all this once he inevitably brings up how long it's been since we were intimate, especially since it used to be me complaining about the low frequency of sex. From outside perspective it seems miserable. I find myself being horny for women I see, telling myself maybe with a woman I would be happier, would feel less shame after sex and more fulfillment from giving pleasure, could go off contraception and see what it feels like to ovulate. I also love him and was ready to spend many more years with him.

TLDR: Definitely not asexual, interested in sex but found it to not be worth it. Clueless in what could be changed and how.",1,1744546685.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

For those new to our Substack, each Sunday I deliver this message while I have my first cup of coffee of the day. I ask that you drink your coffee with me, or have some tea, or water, or pick your drink of choice while we chat. Let’s get into it.

I always like to start these Sunday messages by thanking our subscribers. You have made the MeidasTouch Network the most watched news network in America, beating Fox News. You have also officially made the MeidasTouch Substack the fastest growing channel on all of Substack. We got informed by Substack of this great honor yesterday. We would love for you to subscribe today if you aren’t yet subscribed (Remember to add the MeidasTouch Podcast on Apple Podcasts and Spotify).

Moving on…

This has been a very busy weekend. Three major things happened this weekend already.

First, Trump caved again on tariffs to China and is now giving exemptions for laptops, iPhones, and chips from his tariffs. Trump previously said there would be no exemptions. This is obviously a favor to Trump’s billionaire funders and also appears to be more market manipulation.

Second, Trump is defying the Supreme Court’s 9-0 order requiring the return of Abrego Garcia from the El Salvador gulag back to America. Trump’s DOJ refused to tell the federal district court what steps they were taking to secure the return of Garcia as they were required to do. Thereafter, Trump made a social media post saying that the migrants in the El Salvador gulag were under the “sole custody” of El Salvador’s authoritarian leader Nayib Bukele.

We are now in uncharted territory for our judicial system when the executive branch refuses to abide by a ruling. The right-wing Supreme Court enabled this hellscape with their past rulings giving Trump immunity and blocking his criminal cases from proceeding expeditiously. The MeidasTouch Network will have this story covered with every last detail.

Third, the Fighting

Oligarchy tour led by Senator Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman AOC continues to grow. Their Saturday speech in Los Angeles drew a crowd of 36,000, and thereafter Bernie Sanders spoke to the massive crowd at Coachella. The Coachella crowd loudly booed Donald Trump. As usual, the MeidasTouch Network streamed the full Bernie Sanders / AOC event live.


By now, you know the MeidasTouch Network provides coverage of all the things the media suppresses. That’s why we’ve grown and are now the fastest growing Substack by subscribers. We cover all the protests. We cover all the shadow hearings. We cover all the Bernie rallies. We cover many of the town halls. Our coverage is relentless. I have done around 70 major interviews in the past 3 weeks—or nearly 4 interviews a day with top leaders.

Moving on…

Trump is not known for his patience. He’s lost all pretense that he’s anything other than an authoritarian madman. Things are speeding up. His authoritarian machinations have ratcheted up. At the same time, the opposition and resistance grow and accelerate.

More than ever, we need you in the fight now.

Against all odds, we are still here fighting together and we are stronger than ever. We didn’t bend or break as Trump and Musk wanted. We must work harder now than ever. We will be tested and challenged. Trump and Musk will try to destroy our spirits and joy. They are getting more desperate. Just as the cornered rat (no offense to cornered rats) is dangerous, so too is Trump and his Musk-rat.

Let’s hold the line, Meidas Mighty, and push forward.

We are armed with the power of people. We are armed now with the most viewed media network in the world, the MeidasTouch Network. We’ve got the numbers. We’ve got the message. We’ve got the distribution channels (finally!). We’ve got the momentum. We’ve got the truth. We’ve got each other.

I’m finishing up my coffee.

I am going to make a video for YouTube now.

You can’t even say normal things or make a suggestion without her getting angry.  She expects everyone to treat her right but doesn’t treat anyone else that way.  She doesn’t respond to anyone texts or calls but if you don’t respond to her she gets angry.  She doesn’t want to hear any negativity but is always negative.  She doesn’t think anything is funny that most people do.  You can only get a long with her for a few hours and then things just switch?  It’s just so strange.  

She will plan something but usually backs out or leaves early.  For example, she will rarely go to anyone’s house but if she does she says something like after dinner we can go for a walk, play games, have coffee and desert or something else enjoyable but right after dinner she will say “I think we are going to leave”.  Her and her 4 year old son.  But this predates her son.  She was like this before.  She won’t drive at night even a few minutes.  So if you want her to come to your house (which she rarely will) you have to pick her up and drive her home.  

Her and her son’s father share custody.  He is a good dad but my sister is so hard to get along with so they didn’t stay together.  My parents, husband and I aren’t allowed to have any contact with him.  Her rules. If he sends us pics of their son we are not allowed to respond.  She will only allow us to talk to him if we happen to be watching their son and he is picking him up.  She expects are parents to be available to watch him whenever she needs them to.  They usually are but that is the only time she will ever visit them anymore is to drop him off and pick him up if she needs to run errands. 

Her personality has gotten worse also.  She will tell stories but something they don’t make sense or she mumbles.  She is always saying mmm hmmm to her self.  Something she talks a mile a minute and I don’t know what she is saying.  She can barely sit still sometimes also.  And she is always saying her son’s name over and over and over again to get him to listen.  He isn’t that bad but she makes a big deal over it.  ",1,1744546238.0,personalitydisorders,0,1.0,False

TL;DR: You can check if a product is in stock at your warehouse. When another member sees the product, they can update the system to let others know if it’s available or not. Started this because I wanted some coffee.



I am addicted to coffee.

Okay obsessed.

After trying multiple different brands of coffee — 3 different types just from Starbucks, I had finally found it. 

My holy grail.

STōK Cold Brew Coffee!

It was smooth. It wasn’t bitter. It was love at first sip.

But as soon as I had finally found my coffee of choice, that’s when tragedy struck.

When I went to my local grocery store to restock, they were sold out.

To makes matter worse, the manager tells me that they don’t know when the next shipment will be in. 

This was during the height of the pandemic, around the summertime of 2020, so there were issues with shipment.

Getting desperate, I start a mad hunt for these.

I go to 6(!) different grocery stores and websites to try to find these.

Sobeys, Sobeys Delivery — Voila, Superstore, Superstore pickup, Instacart, Zehrs.

NONE OF THEM HAD IT.

Worst of all, some of the websites and apps would say its available, only for the order to be cancelled because the system wasn’t up to date.

That’s when it hit me.

What if there’s a way for people to let each other know when a product is in stock or not?

That’s when my friends told me about a Facebook group for their local Costco. 

Majority of the page was about members asking each other if they had seen a product at the warehouse.

Seeing that more people than I originally thought had the same problem, I decided to build an easier way to check if an item is available.



Costco Stock Checker: [https://costcostockchecker.com](https://costcostockchecker.com/)

You can think of it like GasBuddy but for Costco products.

You simply search using the product name or the item number and see if it’s in stock.

When another member sees the product at a warehouse, they can report whether it’s available or not.

It’s that simple.

There are other quality of life features like:

You can compare stock availability against multiple warehouses

You can find out the price of the product at a warehouse

Users can report if a product is made in Canada  


Lastly, I update the Canadian and the American product catalog every 2 weeks. 

So if you don’t find the product you are looking for, just email me the product name and the item number to admin@costcostockchecker.com. I will add it right away for you.

Let me know what you think and hope it helps! 

(All feedback are welcome!)

I can’t quite wrap my head around it all. Whilst I thought we were in love, I was playing a game that I didn’t know the rules for. 

I feel like a fool looking back. Blissfully ignorant. I’m finding it hard to reconcile that with myself. I was made a mockery of. I came back so many times thinking they changed. Thinking they’d seen that the love I was giving was genuine. They just wanted validation and to know that someone still loved them. To feel better about themselves. To feel what only you can make them feel. It’s a level of callousness I’ve never experienced. 

I don’t have to tools needed to accept this level of deceit at the hands of someone I once thought I’d marry. Someone I once thought was in the ring fighting with me, not against me.

Im peed off because my husbands mum asks him for money every month. Partner and I are saving together to buy a house and though she doesn't ask for much but we still struggle because of it. Today she asked for 40£, last month she asked for £150. I spoke to my husband about it today and told him it's an issue because if we have our own family and have kids, we'd be struggling because of this. He reassured me and told me it won't come to this because he will be making more money from work, hell be getting raises. . I understood and understand how hard life can be and it's hard to even get a stable job these days so I don't really blame that she's asking my husband for money. 

My mil also  has a grown ass son and a husband, my husband told me that her husband pays for all her bills already and also his brother pays for all the groceries and also runs out of money. I just find it abit annoying if im honest even though I do understand or try to understand this... and my husband does pay all our bills so I'm not fussed. I don't really pay for anything other than bits and bobs here and there and electic which he also tops so I kind of do think I'm in the wrong.  It's just that he said today he doesn't even spend a penny on himself and.he works literally long hours....so I felt bad. Also, we went for a coffee together today and I felt bitter with the fact that he could give his mum 40£ but couldn't me out for a meal today, he said we were running out of money and need to save and suggested that we go for a coffee together which ofc I was fine with until he sent his mum money. I do understand it's his money and he can do whatever he wants with it I know.... I make my own money and take driving lessons and pay for my own course im taking. I put money away for our first home together, he contributes if he can. 
The thing is we are saving for a house and tho he does put away money when he can but that money that he be giving to his mum couldve been used towards our savings even. I honestly dislike her for this a lot. His older brother is married and has children and does not send his mum money, never did even before.  My partner earns decent amount. I'm posting because i kinda wanna get other people's opinions and also wanna know if im actually being a bitch. Today she asked him for money cos she has knee issues and wanted to go for acupuncture which helps her knee issue and she was in so much pain. My husband is kind and he even said he'd give me money too if I asked and even if we had kids he'd provide. I'm not exactly sure why I'm pressed but it could be cos of the fact we couldve saved more or that money couldve been spent on other things. My mil is a nice person but I seriously don't like her cos of this. It just feel like it's going to be an issue in the future...like why can't my mil understand that he is married now and he's going to have kids were trying to buy our first home...if i had kids i wouldn't ask them if they were married and saving for a place, I'd be understanding about this. Idk maybe we just grew up different. ",1,1744545899.0,Marriage,2,1.0,False

They said $5. I told them it would be 7 minute wait for extra crispy. She said she added another $5. I thought this was a lie, but it wasn’t!

# Interesting Letter From Far Away Jerusalem

——————————

We are so thankful the hotel in town was full, otherwise would we would have missed this ideal spot.

Saturday morning—Last night we went out on the lake to see the sunset and the moon rise, then back in time for dinner. This is hardly a monastery—it is a rest house for Pilgrims. One priest from a German Order keeps it and he is supported by this Order in Cologne, Germany. He is a cheerful, honest, energetic sort of a man—very hospitable. At dinner, they first served fish, one to each, the same kind of fish that are supposed to have been seen caught in the miraculous draft of fishes. Then we had mutton, boiled potatoes, cauliflower—I have never seen so much cauliflower as there is in Palestine—and bread made from the wheat grown in Father Tappier’s 280 acre farm and ground at his own mill. I can’t remember what we had for dessert, but we finished with little cups of Turkish coffee. I’m getting so I like it very much.

At the Jordon there were some people touring g---- \[Romani\] fashion, who made us some Turkish coffee. It is always served in tiny cups, smaller than the regular after dinner coffee cups. The place is delightful, the sort of place you could stay on forever. It makes you think of camp and the sea—reminds me of Lake Geneva.

This morning we were up to see the sunrise, then picked flowers on the hillside. The hills are covered with them, mostly red flowers, which look at times like a poppy and at others like a tulip. I’m sure they must be the “lilies of the field,” but they aren’t nearly so common and neither are they “arranged like one of these.”

In a few minutes we are going for a swim, down where a hot spring flows into the sea. It’s not any too warm. I know I shall be grateful for a warm stream. It is colder than I thought. We needed our three steamer rugs coming yesterday and we had two blankets on over these last night.

We are starting back to Jerusalem at 1:00, stopping in Nazareth on our way. We stopped at Jacob’s well; they say its authenticity has never been doubted. There it is with fields all around. But as usual the Greeks have a chapel built over the well itself and are now erecting a church, using the foundation of the church that the Crusaders built. The well is about 75 feet deep. A priest drew water from it for us to drink and then let down a tin with six candles so we could see its depth. We stopped at the place where all Israel assembled in the time of Joshua. We went in an old Samaritan synagogue, where we saw the celebrated Samaritan codex of the Pentateuch. They told us the oldest of the manuscripts dates possibly about the sixth century A. D. They claim that there are only forty real Samaritans left and that their number never increases or decreases.

On either side of the village rises the Mount of Gerizim and Mount Ebal. The scene recorded in Joshua VIII, 33, 34 was at this place. l certainly wish I knew more Bible history: The plain of Esdraelon and the plain of Jezreel is most wonderful. This plain they say has been a battlefield from the days of Barak to those of Napoleon. There was no sign of any battlefield, just fields and fields of newly ploughed earth, or fresh sprouts of wheat; perfectly beautiful. We ate lunch on a mountain down on it, after we had crossed.

We passed the little village of Nain, where Christ raised the widow’s son. We could see Mount Tabor, told of in the Psalms.

We just rode thru Nazareth, by the City of Cana of Galilee, and passed the Mount of Beatitudes where Christ preached the sermon on the Mount. As I write “Christ” I am reminded that I don’t believe I have heard Him referred to as Christ—it is always “Our Lord.” All the priests and monks, no matter whether Greek, Latin or American, say “Our Lord.” It came to me as a dear little Catholic sister was talking to us that it didn’t make any difference in what way we worshipped. He was and is Our Lord.

And then the most wonderful sight of all, just before we came to Tiberius was the snow capped mountains of Mount Hermon, the Mount of Beatitude close by, and the sea of Galilee below—a perfect gem, with such light effects as you can hardly imagine. Somehow I never imagined Galilee to be so beautiful.

We came back to earth and arrived at the hotel in Tiberius with a flat tire, so we waited there on the steps of the hotel with a hundred other tourists while it was fixed. We knew there was no room there because of the tour, so had made arrangements to stay at this monastery six miles out of Tiberius. Deliver us from ever traveling with a tour—they’re awful. No for a swim!

Sunday, Jerusalem — Well, we’re back safe and sound. Got back in time for dinner at seven—cold as charity, but it was all wonderful. In Nazareth went into the “Church of the Annunciation” just at the close of a service—perhaps a special service. It was very impressive. As they left the main part of the church and went down the fifteen marble steps into the “Chapel of the Angel” singing a very beautiful hymn each one in turn knelt and kissed the marble attar which bears the inscription “Here the Word became flesh.” There is only one well or fountain in Nazareth so it must have been the place where Mary came often for water, carrying perhaps the infant child—carrying water and the baby in just the same way we watched the women here yesterday.

This morning we went over the Temple area, the Mosque of Omar, as it is called—sacred to Moslems. This is where Abraham is supposed to have offered up Isaac, \[see the second note below\] when David inter­cedes for the plague—stricken people, and where the Jewish Temple, the Glory of Israel, stood. The guide pointed out places where Abraham prayed, where Mohammed, Soloman and David also prayed. It is the only elaborately beautiful place in Jerusalem.

Not far from here is the Pool of Bethsaida. The French did some excavating there before the war and unearthed a great deal of the pool and part of two porches. Also a part of the church built there by the Crusaders. They are sure the Crusaders never saw the pool because they built over it.

\[Joshua 8: 33, 34: And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.

And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.

2 Chronicles 3:1 states that “Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah”, while the location given in Genesis 22:2 for where Abraham was to offer up Isaac was at “one of the mountains” in the “land of Moriah”.

The temple mount is in Jerusalem, which had already been established by Abraham’s time. The account of Abraham offering up Issac does not describe it as happening in a city or community. These factors may explain why Helen Rysdorp, the author of the letter, wrote “is supposed to have” rather than stating unequivocally that it was the same place.\]

Just in case it was one of these incidents. [https://www.salon.com/1999/09/07/rage/](https://www.salon.com/1999/09/07/rage/) if the news spoke more of these incidents I bet the two flight attendants might have been more forceful to stop nutcases from flying the plane like this one where someone actually grabbed controls on a Japan flight and the real kicker is at the end of the story:

July 23, 1999: Minutes after an All Nippon Airways jumbo jet took off from Tokyo's Haneda Airport, a 28-year-old Tokyo man pulled an 8-inch knife on a flight attendant. He forced his way into the cockpit, told the co-pilot to leave, stabbed Capt. Naoyuki Nagashima in the neck and shoulder, then took control of the aircraft. At one point the plane plunged to within 300 meters of the ground. The co-pilot and two ANA employees stormed the cockpit and overpowered the man. A non-uniformed pilot reportedly landed the plane safely, but Captain Nagashima bled to death. The suspect later told investigators he liked to play flight simulation games and wanted to fly a real plane.""

Too much Flight Simulator. Too much FLIGHT SIMULATOR!! LIKE WTF? It wasn't even that good back then where now you have all sorts of setting to make it as easy or f'king hard as you want if you have a good home cockpit setup especially if it moves around to simulate the 'feel' of an actual airplane.

I can expand further if you have any queries, but I have to be mindful of what I say.

I (27F) work in a small, open-plan office where I’m the only woman and the most recent hire, even though I’ve been here over 5 years.

The office setup is a bit strange, and without getting too specific (because my boss might be lurking here), let’s just say it’s a small team of directors, manager, and planners—including myself. We don’t have a daily cleaner, just a cleaner once a week, so the ""junior"" planners are expected to take care of basic office maintenance, things like: replenishing tea/coffee, cleaning surfaces, loading/unloading the dishwasher, managing post, and buying supplies like milk, tissues, soap, etc. This has been the norm since forever— even the boss and manager did it when they were starting out.

When I first joined, there were three of us planners sharing these tasks. One left, so it became just two. No big deal— I stepped up. But then, end of last year, the other planner had surgery and was out for 10 days, then mostly WFH and limping around two days a week when in office. I covered everything solo during that time— thinking if the roles were reversed, he’d do the same for me. I wasn’t told to do it, I just did.

Three months later, I was still doing it all. My colleague is well enough now to go pub crawling, travel, walk 20k steps in a day—but not well enough to refill the coffee or load/unload the dishwasher?

I’ve also noticed a sense of entitlement and borderline disrespect from others. For example, my manager-boss put his dirty cups on my desk to clear—when the tray is literally three steps away. When I pointed it out, he laughed and shoved them even closer to me.

My mornings are spent tidying up after grown adults while my actual work gets delayed. When I arrive a little late (pre-approved by my boss, by the way), nothing is done— and they all expect me to do these tasks and make their drinks. I don’t even drink tea or coffee. Or I’d have one coffee but I make it at home and take it to work.

The office is generally a mess— tea stains on the wall, dishes left out, passive-aggressive behaviour if I don’t jump to clean first. I’ve had multiple conversations with my boss, who’s been sympathetic and horrified. He said I was within my rights to push back and even suggested sexism might be at play— which, honestly, I can agree with but I never mentioned it, my boss was first to say it. He offered me a raise— not to buy my silence, but because he thinks I deserve more respect from the team, especially after finding out one manager said “my time is worth more than hers.”

Still, things haven’t improved.

There’s weird pettiness now. One time, the dishwasher didn’t run overnight (power cut), so I used older mugs for morning drinks. Everyone could tell it hadn’t been cleaned, but still left dirty dishes on the counter for me to deal with. When I pointed it out, my boss agreed I was right— but nothing changed.

Later, I pushed back when my manager demanded I order Nespresso capsules “because it’s your job.” (It’s not. That’s nowhere in my job description. I was just doing it because someone had to.) I offered to handle stationary and general supplies instead, as my colleague and manager and manager-boss are the ones using the capsules daily, my colleague being the “lesser” of them two should be ordering the capsules, but he shut that down and insisted it is my job. I have been at this company over 5 years, I am not a trainee anymore, I do the exact same work as my colleague so no, it is everyone’s job and not just mine. I have a really long list of instances like the above…

I had to attend a meeting with him and another manager-boss (no sign of the boss) where they told me I “can’t pick and choose” tasks and that my attitude was hurting team morale. Meanwhile, no one considered my morale when I was carrying the load alone for months? Despite my various chats with my boss and manager-boss and nothing happening, the manager and manager-boss said that it will all be on me from now on. Like a punishment for speaking out.

What’s most frustrating is that these cleaning duties were always evenly shared— even after my colleague finished his exams two years ago. Now that I’ve got my own (very demanding) work-related exams, suddenly I’m expected to do everything because I didn’t pass them yet? Worth noting, again, that I do the exact same work as my colleague. Exams or no exams.

I’m starting to feel like they’re pushing me out. I love my actual job and I’ve worked hard to get here. I’m not asking for special treatment— I just want fairness. These tasks were split for years and years and because they became complacent seeing me doing it all for months and I asked for the tasks to be split like they were before, I have now to take the load on ad vitam aeternam?

After the last meeting they even had the audacity to send me a list of things that need to be done morning and evening and on a ad-hoc basis as if I’m not aware of the tasks I’ve been doing most days for the last 5 years!

Am I being unreasonable? Or is this a toxic dynamic dressed up as “office culture”?",2,1744545381.0,UKJobs,18,1.0,False
1jy5yvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1jy5yvi/its_all_about_protein/,It’s all about protein,"ngl I’ve been proteinmaxxing and been using my usual chipotle impulse to buy random protein products when I need to randomly spend $18 (obv this is for like weeks or months worth of protein servings lol) As a result I have a stockpile of months worth of protein rich foods and supplements I don’t think I can eat through without a strategy. I’m small and in a deficit and not a body builder or anything and am saving so much money idek

Made me realize tho why is protein so easy to get and lowkey cheap? I have a harder time getting fat tbh 

Obviously apples to apples yes protein is going to come out more expensive than carbs but like no one buys rice and oats like that at the gas station. Meanwhile these protein snacks from Walmart cost the same. I feel kinda enlightened 

I can’t stand the go-to budget protein sources (boiled chicken/whitefish, egg whites, lean turkey, canned tuna 🤢). Recently I have found so many amazing options and can’t even believe it. I got this blue razz clear protein powder and it’s like juice. I make like protein soda with seltzer or diet soda etc. I add it to greek yogurt and it just tastes like gogurt and is like 40 grams of protein lol. I’ll do it with chocolate flavor cheaper store brand stuff and add instant coffee and stuff and it’s so good compared to a dry chicken breast

Let’s not even get into cheesemaxxing which is obviously a world of its own. I will blend cottage cheese and make the most insane spinach dips and sauces and soups like idek 

Also found these whey protein covered chicken nuggets and they’re so good it’s crazy and like $1 per serving at walmart. Trader Joe’s and all that obviously has the works but I’m not balling in that locality. But damn monthly trips have it made 

some more yums are chimichurri shrimp, blending tofu, so many breads and stuff have protein now. Aldi has a version of 13g protein milk for so cheap  like idek. Protein peanut butter is crazy ngl. Just quietly losing my mind abt this bc I want to annoy people about protein (and fiber actually) 

Also everything just randomly has protein now. Wym this wonder bread has no carbs and 8 grams of protein. “Bone broth” is just pure protein. A whole world of meat…  Fishmaxxing is actually crazy no wonder all those sea gods look ripped idek. random plant proteins to buy and turn into stuff. 

I wanna start making my own stuff like more diy but I need to get thru my collection first lol. But like homemade seitan would go crazy idek. I just love protein

The Importance of Iron in a Plant-Based Diet and How Smoothies Can Help
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Iron is a vital mineral that plays an essential role in supporting overall health. For those following a plant-based diet, meeting daily iron requirements can sometimes be challenging. Unlike animal products, many plant foods contain non-heme iron, which is not as readily absorbed by the body. However, incorporating high-iron smoothies can be an effective strategy to boost iron intake while also providing a delicious and nutritious snack or meal replacement.

Understanding the importance of iron in your diet is crucial. Iron helps transport oxygen throughout your body, supports immune function, and is necessary for energy production. A deficiency in iron can lead to fatigue, weakness, and other health issues. Therefore, it’s essential to include iron-rich foods in your daily meal plan, especially for vegetarians and vegans. Here are several plant-based sources of iron that can easily be blended into smoothies:

​ Discover the delicious smoothie plan that lets you eat normally while you shed the weight! -Click Here to Learn More--&gt; https://freepage.pro/loganferret/smoothiediet   
- **Spinach:** This leafy green is not only packed with iron but also offers a wealth of vitamins and minerals.
- **Kale:** Another leafy green that serves as a great source of iron, kale also provides fiber and antioxidants.
- **Chickpeas:** These legumes are rich in iron and protein, making them a perfect addition to savory smoothies.
- **Pumpkin seeds:** A great topping or ingredient, pumpkin seeds are rich in iron and healthy fats.
- **Fortified plant-based milks:** Many non-dairy milks are fortified with iron, providing an easy way to enhance your smoothies.
- **Nut butters:** Almond or cashew butters add not only iron but also healthy fats and protein.

To maximize iron absorption from your smoothies, combining these iron-rich ingredients with vitamin C sources is beneficial. Vitamin C enhances the absorption of non-heme iron, making it easier for your body to utilize this essential mineral. Here are some excellent sources of vitamin C to add:

- **A citrus fruits:** Oranges, lemons, and limes are excellent choices.
- **Kiwi:** This small fruit is packed with vitamin C and adds a sweet flavor.
- **Strawberries:** Not only delicious, strawberries are also rich in vitamin C.
- **Bell peppers:** Adding bell peppers can provide a crunchy texture and boost your smoothies' vitamin content.

When crafting your high-iron smoothie, think about blending a variety of ingredients to achieve both flavor and nutritional density. A simple recipe might include:

- 1 cup of spinach or kale
- 1 medium banana (for natural sweetness)
- 1 cup of fortified almond milk
- 1 tablespoon of almond butter
- 1/2 cup of strawberries or kiwi
- 1 tablespoon of pumpkin seeds for a crunchy topping

Simply blend all these ingredients together until smooth, and you’ll have a tasty, nutritious smoothie that is both high in iron and filled with vital nutrients!

It’s also helpful to remember that certain foods and beverages can inhibit iron absorption. For instance, consuming caffeine-rich drinks such as coffee or tea close to mealtimes may reduce iron absorption. Try to space these away from your smoothie times so you can reap the maximum benefit from your iron-rich ingredients.

High-iron smoothies into your daily routine doesn’t just help ensure you get adequate iron; it also introduces a wealth of fruits, vegetables, seeds, and nuts into your diet. These foods are all rich in other essential nutrients that contribute to overall wellness. Additionally, smoothies are easy to prepare, portable, and can be customized based on your preferences.

For those who find it difficult to meet their iron needs through food alone, consider talking to a healthcare provider about the possibility of taking iron supplements. However, it’s always best to source nutrients from a balanced diet whenever possible. Making high-iron smoothies regularly can significantly help in enhancing your iron levels, support your overall health, and elevate your energy levels.

Remember, you’re not limited to one flavor or recipe. Feel free to experiment with different combinations using seasonal fruits and vegetables. The more you explore, the more enjoyable your journey towards higher iron intake will become!

### Conclusion

Maintaining adequate iron levels is crucial for everyone, but it becomes particularly important for those following a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle. High-iron smoothies are a delicious and easy way to ensure you’re getting enough of this vital mineral. By incorporating ingredients like spinach, kale, lentils, and rich fruits such as apricots and black currants, you can create smoothies that not only support your iron intake but are also packed with essential vitamins and antioxidants.

Each smoothie recipe provides a unique combination of flavors and health benefits, making it enjoyable and sustainable to meet your nutritional needs. Whether it’s a refreshing spinach and banana blend or a protein-rich lentil and berry mix, there's no shortage of options to keep your taste buds happy while boosting your iron levels.

1jy5uxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelideas/comments/1jy5uxk/anyone_know_the_name_of_book/,Anyone know the Name of book,"A loud moaning coming from the room, I'm sure the voice is from my bestie Ashley.
Shaking my head I turn to walk away when I hear another familiar voice.
“Shhh… Keep quiet, bend over!” My boyfriend Caleb says in a menacing tone.
“You guys have fun? All finished now? Sure you don’t want to have a quickie in the next room?” I say sarcastically.
“You can’t leave me, Harley! I don’t want to live with her, I want you! I love you!” Caleb roars.
“Well… she’s all you have right now because I don’t want you. You both disgust me.""
————————
“Harley! Please tell me you’re ready? We’re going to be late!” Ashley, my best friend knocks on the bathroom door.
I don’t usually go through such effort with my appearance, I’m a less is more type of girl, but since tonight is a special night I wanted to look good for him.
Him, being my boyfriend Caleb, we’ve been best friends for as long as I can remember. 
He comes from a large wealthy family, with both parents in the picture and three brothers, one older than him and twins two years younger than us. My home life doesn’t exactly include a picture perfect family. My mother is a party-holic whom never married my father, her life revolves around hanging out with friends and acting like an eighteen year old. When she met my father she was working at a strip club, the same club she works for now no less.
My father is the president of a Motorcycle Club called Devils Grimm. Yeah…well… he is and his road name is Grimm, for obvious reasons…reasons I sure don’t want to know. He also had an old lady waiting for him back home while he was shacking it up with my mother. Daddy introduced me to his wife, Annalie, on my fifth birthday, he came to see me and found me home alone, momma forgot it was my birthday and was on one of her drinking binges again.
He threatened her with taking custody and decided that after keeping me a secret for five years it was time to take me home for the weekend so I could meet his family…his club. 
We graduated today and it’s our 4th year anniversary too. Ashley, Caleb and I are all going to the same college a few hours away. Caleb and I found an apartment while Ashley decided that it would be more fun in the dorms.
Caleb has been asking me to marry him every month since I turned eighteen and of course I’ve said yes but he says he’s going to propose officially as soon as he can afford to buy me a ring with his own money since he doesn’t want to spend his parent’s money. I know Caleb won’t turn me away once I tell him the news tonight and that’s the reason why tonight is so special because tonight I tell him…that I’m pregnant.
We make our way out her house to our graduation party that the footballers are throwing at one of their parent’s cabins.
I park the car and we head up to the massive log cabin, I told Caleb we would be here at nine and it’s already ten thirty.
“Little Miss Harley Ryder! Is that you?” I look over to Brent, who is Caleb’s best friend. He’s eyeing me up and down in a way he’s done one too many times. I try reach for Ash to help me out of this one but she’s nowhere to be found in the crowded house. Brent is just like Caleb looks wise, apart from his blond hair and blue eyes and looks as if we could be related, he is also tall and muscular, Brent is like a brother to me and him looking at me the way he is right now is making me really uncomfortable.
“Hey Brent. Yeah it’s me.” I give him a shy smile as I finally respond to him.
“Babe! You look HOT! Looks like Caleb and I will be spending the evening fighting the boys off you.” He teases and gives me a tight hug. He isn’t drunk yet but I can smell the drink on him and it grosses me out.
“Speaking of Caleb, have you seen him?” I ask Brent trying to change the subject.
“Yeah, saw him earlier chatting with some of the guys, kept asking if you’ve arrived yet but we didn’t see you come in. Do you want me to help you look for him? Let’s get a drink for you in the meantime.” He says and walks off but I grab his arm and say, “No thanks Brent, I’m going to find the bathroom, I’ll be back now but if you spot him keep him with you and I’ll come find you okay?”
“Sure thing babe.” He says as he walks off backwards smiling at me.
I turn to find my way to the bathroom and I notice a couple of guys looking at me the same way Brent just did…with lust in their eyes and a few even wink.
Argh… Really boys?
I desperately need a pee so I walk a little faster trying to find my way to the bathroom. I spot stairs and walk up them, I notice the party is down stairs and no one is on the top floor, the bass from the speakers downstairs can be felt through the floor but it’s a little quieter up here.
I make my way down the long hallway when I hear loud moaning coming from one of the rooms, I stop because the voice is familiar.
Seriously Ashley? We haven’t even been here for fifteen minutes and she’s already screwing someone. Shaking my head I turn to walk away when I hear another familiar voice.
“Shhh… Keep quiet, bend over!” Caleb says in a menacing tone, one he’s never used on me before. I back away against the wall opposite the door where the noises are coming from. The pain in my heart hurts so bad, my trembling hand sits over my heart feeling it beat wildly as I stand leaning against the wall that’s keeping me from collapsing. I stand there frozen, I try move, try to get away but my legs won’t budge. I knew it was too good to be true, how could he ever be satisfied with me? Ash is the perfect girl for him…she’s everything… I’m not.
I continue to stand there listening to her moans and his grunting. I feel the tears tumbling down my face and the make-up I did so perfectly to please him running, all ruined.
“Whoa… Harlz? What’s wrong? You okay?” Brent comes skidding to a halt beside me, I wasn’t even aware he came upstairs. He looks at me then turns and looks at the door, he does this three more times before his eyes widen and he whispers almost out of breath.
“No…It’s not…It can’t be…” he too can hear the sounds from the room. I nod my head and his face reddens with fury, he tenses his jaw holding back the anger. He goes for the door but I stop him and whisper, “Don’t …just wait…” he nods and pulls me in for a hug while I hear the door open from behind him.
I peak around Brent’s shoulder. I find a distraught looking Caleb looking at the floor, he hasn’t notice me yet. When a sob breaks out my mouth I cover it quick with my hand and he whips his face up to look at me. His once tan skin is pale as a sheet with his mouth hanging open, he looks at what I’m wearing and the look of lust comes across his face and it only disgusts me as much Brent turns around in a protective stance forcing me to stand behind him and I appreciate the distance he’s putting between Caleb and I more than he will ever know.
Ashley bumps into Caleb while paying attention to fixing her dress. She looks up and gasps. A couple more people have now made their way upstairs and are watching the scene unfold while they whisper to one another.
“You guys have fun? All finished now? Sure you don’t want to have a quickie in the next room?” I say sarcastically pointing my finger to the door behind me. I’m wiping away the tears from my face but it’s no use, they keep betraying the brave façade I’m trying to portray.
“Harlz it’s not…I mean …I can explain…she meant nothing. I only love you. I’ve never done this before.” He runs his hands over his face then looks up and takes a step toward me but Brent pushes his hands up to Caleb’s chest. “I swear! I’m so sorry …Please… Harley? Say something!” Caleb rambles on looking around Brent to me, he comes closer but I match his steps with my own as I step away.
“Don’t touch me. It meant nothing to you? Nothing at all? Well it means something to me!” I shout at him. “If you didn’t want to be with me, why not just tell me? Why cheat Caleb? Why?” I yell as the tears begin to fall again.
“No Baby I want to be with you, I love you Harlz you know that! This was a mistake! My head isn’t clear, I’ve got so much going on right now… I don’t know what I was thinking.” He looks up at me, confused and terrified. “I’m going to marry you remember? Let’s just get out of here so we can talk in private, let me explain…Please Harley.” He pleads and I watch the tears fall down his regret filled face. I’ve never seen Caleb cry before, he always shows this brave exterior, especially whenever he’s around his male friends but right now he’s weeping like a baby.
I look to Ashley and she has her hands covering her mouth with the same look of regret covering her own face.
“You can’t leave me Harley! I don’t want to live with her, I want you! I love you!” Caleb roars pushing against Brent’s chest to get to me, a few more of the guys from the team help Brent hold Caleb back.
“Well… she’s all you have right now because I don’t want you. I can’t even look at you… you both disgust me. I hate you right now, you were the one… good thing… I had and now? I don’t want anything to do with you…both of you! Just stay away from me and I’ll stay away from you.”
I jump in my car and speed off down the dust road, the wooded area clears as I head towards the main street of our town. The streets are empty and all the shops are closed, this town is so dead. I stop at the red light and burst out in tears, my whole body is trembling, I touch my tummy protectively and whisper,
“Guess it’s just you and me baby.”
The light turn green, I’m not even two meters away when I see a set of lights on the side of my window, I hear the tires screeching but it’s too late. The sound of the glass shattering hits my ears, the airbag knocks the air out of my lungs, I can hear the scratching of the metal as the car rolls. It all happens so quickly but feels like times frozen as I watched the glass fall around me, the car rolls a couple times then slams against the tree on the side of the road.
I cry in pain as I hit the broken glass beneath me, I hear the metal door above open and feel the presence of someone as they pop their head in.
I must have died because this guy looks like an Angel. A dark Angel. The most beautiful creature I have ever seen asks me in a gruff voice, “Darlin’ are you okay? I’m so sorry, here… please take my hand.” he leans down into the car and pulls out his hand for me to take.
I place my small hand in his large ring covered rough ones and I gently stand and squeeze my way through the buckled seats. He lifts me up and out of the car and carries me to the back of the tree as he sits down leaning against it with me still in his lap. My eyes are beginning to clear but my head still hurts. I take a closer look at his face, he has beautiful blue eyes with black hair, just like Caleb’s although this guy’s hair is much longer, and it covers the side if his face, almost in an “emo” kind of way but it just comes off messy and charming. He has light stubble on his jawline, maybe a day old. He’s wearing a tight black shirt, with a biker leather jacket on, I look at his patch and smile.
“So Raven huh? “ I smile and look up at him as he types on his phone. He seems shocked that I was able to read his badge.
“Hmm Devils Grimm too…” The adrenaline must be running through my body because I feel giddy and my heart is beating really fast. I look at the emblem on the side of the jacket above his name.
“How do you know all this? You are too pretty and innocent to have any business with bikers…” he chuckles and takes a tissue from his pocket and places it against my throbbing head where I hit the window. I take it from him and look down at the blood covered napkin and place it back on my head feeling the adrenaline slowly leave my body, replaced by panic.
“Grimm’s my daddy…” I say. I feel him tense underneath me.
God, you’re Harley? Your daddy’s gonna kill me.” he says, I can sense the fear coming from him. I suppose I would also be afraid of my father.
“Nah…don’t worry about him, I’ll tell him it’s not your fault. It’s okay…” I mumble worried that my father might hurt him for causing this accident.
“No it’s not okay! I shouldn’t have skipped the red light; I was in such a hurry. I’m so sorry Harley. I’ve called for help; the ambulance should be here soon, are you okay?” He says looking my face over, obviously assessing the damage.
“This night couldn’t get any better.” I mumble sarcastically then notice him wince.
“Oh, I’m talking about that I had to deal with tonight…” he looks at me waiting for me to continue.
I moan then explain, “I caught my boyfriend hooking up with my best friend…on our fourth year anniversary. So I guess it can only get better right? When you hit rock bottom, there’s only one way out… right? Up.” I bend to take my heels off but he stops my hand and takes them off for me.
“I’m sorry babe, no one deserves that, give me his name and address and your father and I will pay him and the bimbo a visit.” He gives me a breathtaking smile obviously trying to lighten the mood; I notice he seems older than me but not nearly as old as my father. Even though in this moment I hate Caleb for what he’s done to me I would never ever want to see him hurt and I don’t think I’d ever be able to forgive myself or my father if he did ever hurt him.
“No Raven you can’t tell him about that, I’ll keep your secret if you keep this one. Please!” I beg him, “Daddy will kill him.” I say softly.
He runs his hand through his hair and lets out a deep breath. “M’kay Darlin’. My real names Jace, a pretty girl like you don’t need to call me by my road name.” He flirts making me laugh at his cocky attitude.
I feel cramps in my stomach then I feel an excruciating sharp pain in my lower stomach, it makes me hunch over and hold my belly while using the streetlight post for support as I cry out.
“Oh baby, please be okay.” I say as the tears fall, Jace does a double take when he sees me then races in my direction. He tells me my father is on his way. I feel warm liquid running down my legs, I look down and see blood.
“Oh no…” I say crying harder. Jace holds me against his chest tight preventing me from fallen to my feet.
“W….what’s happening? You’re bleeding!” Jace panics when he notices the blood, he pushes me away from him still holding my arms tight looking me over to see where the blood is coming from, I hear the sirens coming over the hill.
“Jace I think…I think….I’ m miscarrying…” I say dejectedly as look up into his beautiful eyes and feel the tears escape mine.
“You’re pregnant? Why didn’t you tell me when I got you out of the car? This is my fault! I’m so sorry Harley.” he says filled with sorrow as he pulls me closer into his chest and pecks my forehead.
“It’s …it’s…” I don’t even know what to say? Should I say it’s okay and make him feel better about the situation when all I really want to do is scream and shout at him and tell him this is all his fault. I do neither and opt for a different approach.
“When they take me… don’t leave me alone… please.” I beg as I cry into him.
“I won’t leave you baby…I promise…I’ll be by your side the whole time.”
I wake up and hear my fathers and Anna’s voice, they don’t notice I’m waking up so I keep my eyes closed as I listen to what they’re saying.
“Ann baby, she’s coming with us, I don’t care what her mother says and it’s final. I’m not going to argue about this with you.” My father says in a harsh tone.
“Grant please, we should speak to her mother first and let her know what’s happening to Harley, maybe Harley doesn’t even want to stay with us, it’s the right thing to do!” Anna argues with him.
“I don’t care about what the right thing to do is, Harley is MY daughter and she should have been with us from the moment she was born. She could have died, I’m not losing any more time with my baby because her mother is too selfish to let her go. Have you seen how skinny she is? I stopped at the house before I came to the hospital to tell Roxanne about the accident, the cupboards are all empty and the only thing in that fridge is drink! She won’t let her live with me because of the club but I will at least be able to feed my child and look after her. Harley is eighteen, she can make her own decisions now, if she wants to I’ve with us then it’s happening …whether her mother likes it or not!” My father lectures poor Anna and I don’t hear a reply from her. There’s no arguing with my father, he always gets his way.
I attempt to loosen the tension in the room, “Daddy, I’ll stay with you and Mom.” I say with a rough dry voice.
I open my eyes to see my dad whip his head around and rush to my side along with Anna. My biological mother is known as Momma and Anna is Mom to me. Anna smiles at me.
“Baby girl, we were so worried about you! You’ve been out for a couple of hours, doc says the meds were pretty strong but didn’t think they’d have you sleeping this long. How are you feeling?” my father says as he looks me over and pecks my forehead.
“I’m feeling better, how’s Jace? “ I ask them.
“Jace is fine sweetie, he just went downstairs to get us some coffee so he should be here soon. All your friends are out there waiting to hear if you’re okay, want me to let them in?” Anna says and I know by the way she says friends, who exactly she is talking about….Caleb.
“No! Don’t!” I blurt out and she raises her brow confused by my outburst. “I think you should just tell them I’m asleep, I’m guessing it’s late and they should… um… go home. Tell them you’ll let them know when I’m awake or something.” I beg Anna giving her a pleading look and she nods, pecks my cheek and leaves the room.
My body is sore and stiff, the medicine I was prescribed was definitely doing its magic. Jace sits in the back with me while Anna and daddy are up front. We’re escorted all three hours back to the club house. I woke up as Jace carried me into a room and placed me on the bed. I knew it was his room from the scent that surrounded me. He placed a side light on and I sat up in bed wiping my eyes.
“Grimm told me to look after you;, he hasn’t had a chance to get your room ready. Guess you will be sleeping next to me so I can keep an eye on you if anything happens.” Jace winks as he closes his room door and stalks over towards a desk where he throws his leather jacket over the chair. 
He sits on the bed and takes his boots off, followed by his shirt. He’s definitely something else. His chest has a tattoo of two large sparrows surrounded by beautiful red roses. His papilla are pierced too with small little studs in each. He suddenly stands and I watch his hands go to his black studded belt but suddenly he stops with his fingers on the zip of his jeans and he looks down at me.
“Um… Sweetness, you might want to turn around, I’m commando.” His grin appears and I know I’ve been caught staring. Thank goodness I’m not drooling. I quickly turn my head and hide it in his pillow covering my face as I lie down.
Oh god how am I going to get any sleep with all THAT next to me…Argh…
I feel the bed dip behind me and the covers are pulled, I move up to the other side of the bed as far away from him as possible. I take a sneak peak to see him getting comfortable leaning his hands behind his head.
I raise an eyebrow and point to the large thick blanket, “I swear Jace… you better not be undressed underneath here.”
He chuckles as he rests his head on his folded arm making the muscles stick out and flex. “Why don’t you have a look and find out?” he gives me a naughty smile as he lifts the blanket slightly. I quickly turn my head and whine, “Jace…”
“Didn’t think I’d get this response the first time I brought a girl to my bed.” He says dramatically and I whip my head back to face him.
“What do you mean first time you brought a girl to your bed?” I ask confused, surely he would have tons of girls lining up for him.
I don’t know how but he reads my thoughts, “Oh baby I have plenty of girls waiting on me but I never bring them back here. I’d rather they not know where I stay so they don’t hassle me after all is said and done. I don’t want a relationship, I could never make one woman happy and I don’t do well with commitment. I’m still young, I can worry about having an old lady in a couple years. You’re the first girl to ever sleep here next to me.” He says in a cocky tone as if it doesn’t faze him.
What a player….
“That’s disgusting…” I fold my arms over my chest, “…and why am I so special that that you allow me to grace your precious bed with my presence?” I say sarcastically causing him to chuckle.
“Yes you are very special."" [Read more](https://novels-for-all.com/best-novel-platforms)",1,1744544945.0,Novelideas,0,1.0,False

I've been struggling with IBS for years. Today just wasn't that. I had a ""normal"" BM for the first time in ages. 
I thought I understood ""food noise"". I always thought about food. I always wanted to snack and have been hungry all the time for ages. Now I feel mildly hungry and thinking about food is more like thinking about a crayon or an iron or a shoe. It doesn't trigger anything in my brain and it's like something in the distance that I don't need anymore than anything else. It's just a thing, not a trigger to mindlessly search the kitchen for a handful of almonds or who knows what else in search of satisfaction. I just don't care. 
It's sobering (no pun intended) to realize maybe my hunger and constant thinking about food was a signal of addiction.  I wondered about that for a long time. Now I'm like, I'm not controlled by my thoughts around food. I just don't care much about it. We even split a cookie last night, it didn't make me feel anything.  I usually feel a little buzz or extra happiness when I eat one. Today I felt nothing. Just tasted the cookie and thought it was nice, but I didn't want more. 
I have an autoimmune disorder that causes a lot of joint pain. It was flaring before I had the shot. It's seriously flared now. My hands and back hurt like hell and are stiff. I have had the face flushes and random abdominal discomfort previous to the shot too. I think being already in a flare is why it's worse today, the morning of day 2. 
I also have Menieres.  It's not bad, but I feel a lot of fullness and discomfort right now. The weather is likely the culprit. But I'm paying attention to everything, so I'm hyperaware of my symptoms.  The barometer shows a major change in pressure, I know that's the biggest factor in my ear response.

I'm not going to weigh everyday. I don't want to obsess over a number. I will weigh weekly I think. 

I woke up nauseated this morning and a little stoved up (constipated for those who don't speak southern slang). I had magnesium last night so maybe I need a higher dose. The nausea is manageable. I'm nauseated a lot on the autoimmune meds and with Menieres, so my tolerance is a little higher. I have some meclizine (less drowsy dramamine) i can take and ginger candy if I need it. My coffee went down okay, so there's that. :-) 

I didn't sleep well. I take spells like that so I'm not entirely sure what's going on there.

1jy5mim,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jy5mim/is_it_my_fault_it_didnt_work_out/,Is it my fault it didn't work out?,"I 26m was dating a 23f who I met while travelling at the end of last year. We were only in the same places for a few days and nothing romantic happened, but I felt we got on really well, we had a nice teasing relationship and I gravitated towards her. Afterwards we kept messaging about our travels and coincidentally both returned home at the same time, and I knew she was moving into a new city close to me at the start of this year, about an hour commute away.

Although we got on well, I wasn't massively sure whether we had a lot of things in common, and I was mindful about the age gap, knowing she was moving into a big city and may just want to enjoy single life for a bit, while I've got to the point that although I love socialising, big nights out aren't my thing anymore.

We went for a coffee when we got back which was great, and afterwards I asked her whether she wanted to see if we were anything more than friends, and happily she agreed to a date. We're both busy, sociable people, so we couldn't meet up for another 5 weeks later, but continually messaged throughout this time.

Eventually we went on a first date, which I really enjoyed, but again I felt like I've maybe had a better connection with other people in the past - I'm very heavy on sarcasm for humour, and while she could be, it wasn't her whole personality. At the end of the date, she went in for a kiss, which surprised me but I certainly liked her enough to do so.

Next week I met her again, and while it wasn't perfect, I did really like her and wanted it to go further, but was now wary of getting hurt and wanted to make sure we were aligned with values and that we had enough in common.

The week after she invited me around to hers. I've always felt slightly awkward whenever I've gone to other people's places - I can't put my finger on why it is, but I don't really know what to do with myself at times while they're going around organising stuff. Bit of a weird one! But I do feel that awkwardness has come across to the other person in the past and I feel like it did here too.

I didn't want to sleep with her or anything as again I really did want something serious, and I just wanted to use the limited time we had to chill and chat about life and work out if we were compatible. I didn't want to watch anything on TV - we just cuddled on the sofa and talked. At times I ran out of things to say to her, but I didn't mind that as I felt so good just being sat in her company being affectionate.

Next week she went a bit quiet - our messaging wasn't relentless anyway, but her replies were noticeably less frequent, until she out of the blue said her availability had changed and she could come to visit me the next day or a week after. This felt like a big move as I'd been coming to her city each time, and she was going to come the next day after work at great time and expense.

We did similar to when I came to hers, had some food and then chilled on the sofa, and again I didn't want to watch anything so we could just chill and chat and I could work out if we were right for each other. It felt very similar to the previous week, which unfortunately wasn't really a good thing, as we started having the same conversations as before, and just as many comfortable silences, which started to feel more awkward.

As soon as she left I knew it had gone badly - it was like we had run out of the fun we had and exhausted what we had in common. She went quiet and when I asked her how she felt about the situation I got the answer I was expecting - she really enjoyed getting to know each other but thought we were better as just friends.

I replied saying I would have seen her again but I did feel like it didn't really happen when she came to visit me so understood her decision, and she said it would be nice to still catch up as she had really enjoyed getting to know me. This was a month ago now, and six months after we first met.

I'm not someone who finds someone to date very often, partly as I've been really busy the last few years and not in a situation where I've been able to actively look. I lived abroad for a year and planned to go travelling afterwards, so I was half-heartedly on dating apps etc, but even then I've always struggled to find people I'm compatible with, and have never been in a relationship.

I've recently moved into a new role at work which I'm really content in, and finally moved out into a new flat at the start of the year when I came back from travelling where I'm happy. I felt like the stars were aligning and that I was ready for her to be the final piece of the jigsaw, which is why this is taking a lot of effort to get over.

I'm doing all the things people say to do in this situation - I've muted her socials, every weekend I've been busy meeting friends and in the week going to the gym, engaging in my hobbies, and also getting back on apps and making an effort.

Although I'm very happy with my own life, I'm starting to feel like because I've had a lot of amazing experiences, the excitement for my hobbies and normal life in general is starting to wane, and in reality I just want someone who I can have new excitement and experiences with.

I went on a date yesterday hoping that it would go well and give me some perspective on this girl, but unfortunately I knew 10 minutes in we weren't even slightly compatible - she didn't have a similar personality or lifestyle. So sadly this has actually made it worse because it's made me think even more that me and this girl actually did have a lot more in common than I realised.

My regret is that my way of trying to work out if we could be something serious actually may have ended up stagnating the dates, and so instead of naturally just enjoying each other's company and figuring it out from there, I got awkward, dried up our meet ups, and made her lose the excitement she had about me.

Unfortunately she didn't go into anymore detail other than saying she thought we were better as just friends, so I don't know how she really felt about it, and whether she was completely done and uninterested or just wanted to call it off before anyone got more hurt.

The only correct route I can see at the moment is to leave her be for a number of months, allow time to heal, work on myself and date other people. If she reaches out, whether to be a friend or more, I can deal with that based on how I'm feeling at the time. If she doesn't, once I'm better, and if I've not found anyone in the meantime, I could consider reaching out as a friend and then seeing how it goes and if not having the pressure of dating brings back the spark.

As you can tell by how long this message is I'm naturally a massive overthinker, which doesn't help the process of getting over somebody, and doesn't help with dealing with regret I have about my part in it not working out.

I feel like I've missed out on someone it could genuinely have worked out with because of my own awkwardness - am I right in feeling this way, or is this just part of the healing process?

1jy5mfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1jy5mfo/the_man_behind_pump_6_op/,The Man Behind Pump 6 (OP),"I’ve been working the graveyard shift at Hollow Creek Gas & Go for almost a year now. It’s not exactly a career move—just something I picked up after dropping out of college and losing touch with whatever ambition I used to have. I’m 27, still crashing at my aunt’s place, and pulling 11 PM to 7 AM shifts six nights a week.

It’s quiet most of the time. Just truckers looking for coffee, tweakers begging for a bathroom key, and the occasional lost tourist who doesn’t realize GPS cuts out near the woods behind the station.

But there’s something about this place. Something wrong. And I should’ve left a long time ago.

It started with Pump 6.

That pump had been broken since I got the job. The numbers don’t light up. The card reader’s busted. Management always says someone’s coming out to fix it, but no one ever shows. A week into the job, I asked my manager why we didn’t just rope it off. He just looked at me, pale-faced, and said:

“Just leave it alone. If anyone ever uses it, don’t go outside. Not until they’re gone.”

I thought he was joking. That was, until two weeks ago.

It was around 3:33 AM—dead hour. I was at the register reading a dog-eared Stephen King paperback when I heard the ding. Someone had pulled up. The monitor clicked on and showed a blurry feed from Pump 6.

There was a man standing by the pump. No car. Just him.

He was tall, rail-thin, wearing a stained white shirt and slacks like he’d been working in an office in 1985 and never left. He stood still, eyes locked on the store. On me.

I thought maybe it was a drunk. I buzzed the intercom.

“Sir, that pump’s out of order. You’ll need to move to another one.”

He didn’t respond. Just stood there with his hand resting on the nozzle. That was when the camera began to flicker. The lights above Pump 6 started to hum, then buzz violently—until they went black. Total darkness.

I looked outside. The parking lot lights were still on. All of them—except over Pump 6. Just a single shape now, outlined in darkness, unmoving.

Then I blinked.

And he was gone.

I ran the loop around the store, checked the aisles, the restrooms, even the dumpsters. Nothing.

When I told my manager the next night, his face dropped. He didn’t say a word—just walked into the back, came out with a bottle of whiskey, took a long swig, and handed me a dusty old binder. Inside was a log.

Incidents at Pump 6.

Dates. Names. Descriptions of a man in white. Notes about electrical failures. Distorted voices on the intercom. People going missing.

And a Polaroid.

It was grainy, but it showed the man. Same clothes. Same dead stare. But this photo was dated March 4, 1981.

That was over forty years ago.

⸻

Last night, things escalated.

Around 2:45 AM, I started hearing whispers over the store speakers. Like a radio tuned between frequencies. At first it was static. Then, a voice—low, drawn out, like it was underwater:

“Come outside, Jason.”

I froze. I hadn’t told anyone my name that night. I muted the sound system, thinking it was a prank.

Then the lights cut out. Not just over Pump 6—the whole store went dark. Only the emergency backup lighting stayed on, casting dim red glows across the walls like the entire place was bleeding.

The camera feed flickered back on.

He was inside the store.

Standing by the snacks. Facing the wall.

I grabbed the bat we keep under the counter and called 911, whispering into the phone. The dispatcher answered—but the voice wasn’t hers. It was his again.

“Jason. The pump is ready. You need to fill the tank.”

The call dropped. I backed into the office, locked the door, and watched on the monitors.

He didn’t move.

Not for minutes. Not for hours.

Just stood there, back to me, hands twitching like he was mimicking holding a nozzle. The bat in my hand felt like a twig.

Then he finally turned.

His face—

It wasn’t decayed or mutilated. It was smooth, like wax. No mouth. Just two eyes, jet black, sunken and endless.

I blacked out.

⸻

When I came to, it was daylight. A sheriff was shaking me awake in the office. No signs of the man. No damage to the store.

But Pump 6?

It was…different.

The screen now worked. Flickering. Displaying one word:

“Filled.”

No receipt. No charge. No car.

Just that word. Filled.

I don’t know what that means. I don’t want to know.

But I put in my two weeks. And I haven’t been back.

My replacement? A kid named Derrick. Young, cocky. Thought I was full of shit when I warned him.

Last night, I got a call at 3:33 AM. I didn’t answer.

He left a voicemail.

Just static.

Then, one whisper, barely audible.

“Pump 6 is empty again.”

Some days i don’t even know what i’m looking for peace, a sign, just something to let me know he’s still around somehow.

Last week, i sat down with this journal i bought called “dad, i keep searching for answers.” i wasn’t expecting much, but one of the prompts asked:

“dad, if you were here, i know you’d tell me…”

I wrote:

“You’re going to be okay. just keep going, even when it’s hard.”

Didn’t think much of it at the time. just wrote and closed the book.

The next morning, i was having a rough one, everything felt extra heavy, like i couldn’t shake the sadness. i decided to go for a walk, hoping it would help clear my head.

I ended up near this tiny coffee shop i don’t usually go to. i wasn’t even planning to stop there, but i did. While waiting in line, i noticed this random stack of old magazines and vintage cards on a shelf. i picked one up without thinking, and I kid you not, it was a vintage bodybuilding card, and printed on it were the exact words i had written the night before:

“You’re going to be okay. just keep going.”

I froze.

No one was around. i hadn’t told anyone what i wrote. it felt… weird. Unexplainable. maybe it was just a total coincidence. or maybe it wasn’t. maybe, somehow,he heard me.

I walked out of that café holding back tears, but for the first time in a long while, i felt this strange kind of peace.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best wine gift boxes of 2025 stand out due to their careful selection of high-quality components and attention to detail. Several key features differentiate the premium options from the standard offerings.

**Variety of Wine Selections**

A top-tier wine gift box doesn't limit itself to just one type of wine. The ideal box offers a curated selection of wines, potentially including a bold Cabernet Sauvignon, a crisp Sauvignon Blanc, and a delicate Ros茅. This variety caters to different palates and allows the recipient to explore new wine styles. Premium selections also consider the vintage and region of origin, adding a layer of sophistication and storytelling to the gift.

**Gourmet Food Pairings**

The inclusion of complementary food items is crucial for enhancing the wine-tasting experience. The best boxes feature artisanal cheeses, gourmet crackers, premium chocolates, and perhaps even savory charcuterie. These items are carefully selected to complement the specific wines included in the box, creating a harmonious flavor profile that elevates the overall experience. The sourcing of these gourmet items from reputable producers is also a key factor in determining the quality of the gift box.

**High-Quality Wine Accessories**

Beyond the wine and food, essential accessories enhance the act of enjoying the wine itself. A well-equipped wine gift box includes a high-quality wine opener, often a durable and stylish corkscrew. Other useful accessories could be wine stoppers to preserve unfinished bottles, aerators to enhance the wine's aroma and flavor, and even elegant wine glasses specifically designed for the included varietals. The material and craftsmanship of these accessories contribute to the overall luxurious feel of the gift.

**Elegant Presentation and Packaging**

The presentation of the wine gift box is just as important as the contents themselves. The best boxes utilize high-quality materials, such as elegant wooden boxes or beautifully designed cardboard packaging. The interior arrangement is carefully considered to create a visually appealing and organized display. Details like custom-printed ribbons, personalized cards, and protective packaging further elevate the unboxing experience and communicate the thoughtfulness behind the gift.

Key features of premium wine gift boxes include:

* Carefully selected wine varieties
* Gourmet food pairings designed to complement the wines
* High-quality wine accessories
* Elegant and thoughtful packaging

That pump had been broken since I got the job. The numbers don’t light up. The card reader’s busted. Management always says someone’s coming out to fix it, but no one ever shows. A week into the job, I asked my manager why we didn’t just rope it off. He just looked at me, pale-faced, and said:

“Just leave it alone. If anyone ever uses it, don’t go outside. Not until they’re gone.”

I thought he was joking. That was, until two weeks ago.

It was around 3:33 AM—dead hour. I was at the register reading a dog-eared Stephen King paperback when I heard the ding. Someone had pulled up. The monitor clicked on and showed a blurry feed from Pump 6.

There was a man standing by the pump. No car. Just him.

He was tall, rail-thin, wearing a stained white shirt and slacks like he’d been working in an office in 1985 and never left. He stood still, eyes locked on the store. On me.

I thought maybe it was a drunk. I buzzed the intercom.

“Sir, that pump’s out of order. You’ll need to move to another one.”

He didn’t respond. Just stood there with his hand resting on the nozzle. That was when the camera began to flicker. The lights above Pump 6 started to hum, then buzz violently—until they went black. Total darkness.

I looked outside. The parking lot lights were still on. All of them—except over Pump 6. Just a single shape now, outlined in darkness, unmoving.

Then I blinked.

And he was gone.

I ran the loop around the store, checked the aisles, the restrooms, even the dumpsters. Nothing.

When I told my manager the next night, his face dropped. He didn’t say a word—just walked into the back, came out with a bottle of whiskey, took a long swig, and handed me a dusty old binder. Inside was a log.

Incidents at Pump 6.

Dates. Names. Descriptions of a man in white. Notes about electrical failures. Distorted voices on the intercom. People going missing.

And a Polaroid.

It was grainy, but it showed the man. Same clothes. Same dead stare. But this photo was dated March 4, 1981.

That was over forty years ago.

⸻

Last night, things escalated.

Around 2:45 AM, I started hearing whispers over the store speakers. Like a radio tuned between frequencies. At first it was static. Then, a voice—low, drawn out, like it was underwater:

“Come outside, Jason.”

I froze. I hadn’t told anyone my name that night. I muted the sound system, thinking it was a prank.

Then the lights cut out. Not just over Pump 6—the whole store went dark. Only the emergency backup lighting stayed on, casting dim red glows across the walls like the entire place was bleeding.

The camera feed flickered back on.

He was inside the store.

Standing by the snacks. Facing the wall.

I grabbed the bat we keep under the counter and called 911, whispering into the phone. The dispatcher answered—but the voice wasn’t hers. It was his again.

“Jason. The pump is ready. You need to fill the tank.”

The call dropped. I backed into the office, locked the door, and watched on the monitors.

He didn’t move.

Not for minutes. Not for hours.

Just stood there, back to me, hands twitching like he was mimicking holding a nozzle. The bat in my hand felt like a twig.

Then he finally turned.

His face—

It wasn’t decayed or mutilated. It was smooth, like wax. No mouth. Just two eyes, jet black, sunken and endless.

I blacked out.

⸻

When I came to, it was daylight. A sheriff was shaking me awake in the office. No signs of the man. No damage to the store.

But Pump 6?

It was…different.

The screen now worked. Flickering. Displaying one word:

“Filled.”

No receipt. No charge. No car.

Just that word. Filled.

I don’t know what that means. I don’t want to know.

But I put in my two weeks. And I haven’t been back.

My replacement? A kid named Derrick. Young, cocky. Thought I was full of shit when I warned him.

Last night, I got a call at 3:33 AM. I didn’t answer.

He left a voicemail.

Just static.

Then, one whisper, barely audible.

“Pump 6 is empty again.”

I will be visiting George Town from 20 to 23 April, excluding my departure and arrival days I will have 2 full days to explore the city. Just writing here to get advice and recommendations. 

\- Regarding Grab does it work just like Uber does? how much would it cost more of less from the airport to George Town?

\- I know the weather there is quite awful and hot all the time, but I hope it doesnt rain all the time

\- Is the city walkable for the most part or will I need to use Grab to go everywhere?

\- For the Penang Hill observation look out can someone tell me when the sun is behind me? morning or afternoon? I am going there to take photos of the city so I don't want the sun to be in front of my camera.

\- Best coffee and pastries in the city?

\- Feel free to suggest any other yummy food places for breakfast, lunch and dinner 

\- Do a lot of tourists visit your city or not really?

To the point where there have been weeks during sleep regressions that I was getting maybe three hours of sleep a night. 

I desperately *desperately* want to wake up before my kids. I'm a nicer person when I can take some alone time before the chaos begins and have time to wake up without getting overstimulated. The problem is, my son seems to actively go out of his way to make sure I never get enough sleep.

When I stay up late to get that much needed alone time, he wakes up every 5 minutes. When I set an alarm to wake up early, coffee prepped and everything, he's up for hours at night. And if he does manage to sleep well (only waking up 3-4 times) and I do finally get to get up with my 5am alarm, he wakes up before I've even managed to finishing using the toilet. He sleeps in his own bed (never though the night), naps in his own bed (45mins to an hour), goes to sleep at night at 730 after dinner and bath time.

I feel like I'm losing my everloving mind. 

When he stays the night with my in Laws, he sleeps though the night and sleeps in every morning until 830. With my husband in charge on the mornings I have work, he sleeps until 9am without a peep. But for me? Up by 630am even if he's awake all hours of the night. Awake and ready to party the second my alarm goes off on THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE. When I lay down at night, it's no exaggeration when I say that he literally wakes up the instant I start to fall asleep. Every. Single. Night. 

I genuinely feel like the universe is punishing me for something??? 

I've been awake with him since 515 already this morning. All I wanted to do was work on my novel in peace or work on my new puzzle without someone yanking the pieces off the table because they want to help. But here I am, fighting off tears once again.

I can expand further if you have any queries, but I have to be mindful of what I say.

I (27F) work in a small, open-plan office where I’m the only woman and the most recent hire, even though I’ve been here over 5 years.

The office setup is a bit strange, and without getting too specific (because my boss might be lurking here), let’s just say it’s a small team of directors, manager, and planners—including myself. We don’t have a daily cleaner, just a cleaner once a week, so the ""junior"" planners are expected to take care of basic office maintenance, things like: replenishing tea/coffee, cleaning surfaces, loading/unloading the dishwasher, managing post, and buying supplies like milk, tissues, soap, etc. This has been the norm since forever— even the boss and manager did it when they were starting out.

When I first joined, there were three of us planners sharing these tasks. One left, so it became just two. No big deal— I stepped up. But then, end of last year, the other planner had surgery and was out for 10 days, then mostly WFH and limping around two days a week when in office. I covered everything solo during that time— thinking if the roles were reversed, he’d do the same for me. I wasn’t told to do it, I just did.

Three months later, I was still doing it all. My colleague is well enough now to go pub crawling, travel, walk 20k steps in a day—but not well enough to refill the coffee or load/unload the dishwasher?

I’ve also noticed a sense of entitlement and borderline disrespect from others. For example, my manager-boss put his dirty cups on my desk to clear—when the tray is literally three steps away. When I pointed it out, he laughed and shoved them even closer to me.

My mornings are spent tidying up after grown adults while my actual work gets delayed. When I arrive a little late (pre-approved by my boss, by the way), nothing is done— and they all expect me to do these tasks and make their drinks. I don’t even drink tea or coffee. Or I’d have one coffee but I make it at home and take it to work.

The office is generally a mess— tea stains on the wall, dishes left out, passive-aggressive behaviour if I don’t jump to clean first. I’ve had multiple conversations with my boss, who’s been sympathetic and horrified. He said I was within my rights to push back and even suggested sexism might be at play— which, honestly, I can agree with but I never mentioned it, my boss was first to say it. He offered me a raise— not to buy my silence, but because he thinks I deserve more respect from the team, especially after finding out one manager said “my time is worth more than hers.”

Still, things haven’t improved.

There’s weird pettiness now. One time, the dishwasher didn’t run overnight (power cut), so I used older mugs for morning drinks. Everyone could tell it hadn’t been cleaned, but still left dirty dishes on the counter for me to deal with. When I pointed it out, my boss agreed I was right— but nothing changed.

Later, I pushed back when my manager demanded I order Nespresso capsules “because it’s your job.” (It’s not. That’s nowhere in my job description. I was just doing it because someone had to.) I offered to handle stationary and general supplies instead, as my colleague and manager and manager-boss are the ones using the capsules daily, my colleague being the “lesser” of them two should be ordering the capsules, but he shut that down and insisted it is my job. I have been at this company over 5 years, I am not a trainee anymore, I do the exact same work as my colleague so no, it is everyone’s job and not just mine. I have a really long list of instances like the above…

I had to attend a meeting with him and another manager-boss (no sign of the boss) where they told me I “can’t pick and choose” tasks and that my attitude was hurting team morale. Meanwhile, no one considered my morale when I was carrying the load alone for months? Despite my various chats with my boss and manager-boss and nothing happening, the manager and manager-boss said that it will all be on me from now on. Like a punishment for speaking out.

What’s most frustrating is that these cleaning duties were always evenly shared— even after my colleague finished his exams two years ago. Now that I’ve got my own (very demanding) work-related exams, suddenly I’m expected to do everything because I didn’t pass them yet? Worth noting, again, that I do the exact same work as my colleague. Exams or no exams.

I’m starting to feel like they’re pushing me out. I love my actual job and I’ve worked hard to get here. I’m not asking for special treatment— I just want fairness. These tasks were split for years and years and because they became complacent seeing me doing it all for months, I have to take the load on ad vitam aeternam?

After the last meeting they even had the audacity to send me a list of things that need to be done morning and evening and on a ad-hoc basis as if I’m not aware of the tasks I’ve been doing most days for the last 5 years!

Look, no one’s thrilled to send price increase emails—but if you’re feeling the squeeze from tariffs, you’re not the only one.
Handled right, your subscribers will get it—and stick around.

If you’re raising prices due to the new coffee tariffs, here’s how I recommend approaching your email without triggering unsubscribes — just clear communication, a little context, and a lot of trust.

Start with a simple subject line that doesn’t alarm, just informs: something like “Behind the Beans: What’s Changing in Your Coffee” or “Why Coffee Prices Are Going Up — And What We’re Doing About It” Then, in the body of the email, lead with honesty: let your customers know that due to recent tariff increases on green coffee imports, you’ll be making a small pricing adjustment. No need to get deep into policy — just enough to explain that countries like Vietnam (46%) and Indonesia (32%) are being hit hard, and even if those origins aren’t in your blends, the effects ripple across the industry.

Next, be specific. State exactly what the change is and when it starts. Something like: “Beginning May 1st, your [subscription/product] will reflect a modest price increase of $2 per bag, helping us continue sourcing responsibly without cutting corners on quality. — clarity builds trust make sure to give them a heads-up about what’s coming next.

Follow that with a brief reassurance: remind them that you’re committed to ethical sourcing, maintaining quality, and being transparent through changes. You can also include options: offer them the ability to pause, downgrade, or adjust their plan — giving them a sense of agency goes a long way.

End with a personal touch: “Thanks for sticking with us — if you have questions, just hit reply. We’re happy to talk.” Keep the tone human, calm, and helpful.

(No pressure),"I (26M) have been married to my wife (28F) for just over a year. We went away on our anniversary abroad but, personally, it didn't feel like it was much a celebration of our love and just a bit of time away. I wasn't expecting us to be all over each other but we just feel like 2 people getting by with each other. Some context to our relationship is we got together in 2021, found out we were pregnant a few months in and then our beautiful nearly 3 yo is growing up to be an amazing human! 

I think that a lot of people will say we rushed into things but I feel like that's how we are. We met on a dating app, she lived 3 hrs away. After meeting up a few times and speaking for months every second we could get, we decided to go away for 6 weeks traveling the UK. This is where I personally had some issues. The decision to go away was my wifes, she didn't have a job and I had a really bad job I hated. She convinced me to quit my job and go on this 6 week holiday. I had no job to come back to, she decided after the holiday she would come and live with me in my home town and that was that. 

One great thing about that holiday was you get to know what it's like living with someone. I was still living with my mum and had come out of a relationship 5 months before me and my wife started talking. Is that too short a gap? I'm a perosn who likes to be in a relationship, whether that's with a close friend or partner. Doesn't have to be romantic, but of course a romantic relationship is something a bit deeper. We found out we were pregnant whilst staying at my parents, the next day I applied for a job and that week I was hired in a restaurant. I worked a lot of hrs and she was left at my parents home. Understandably she didn't feel entirely comfortable and honestly I'd started to get on with someone well at my new job. I didn't love this women, but we did get on, in fact I don't even think she'd look at me twice now but at the time I looked forward to seeing her everyday. Here's where me being incredible reckless comes in... my wife had found my search history, describing this women and some ""exciting"" content that I shouldn't have been looking at. I've always had a bad relationship with Porn, at it always comes and goes. I didn't realise my wife had seen this until several years later  which explained why whilst I was working there she started crying one night saying  she had to go home and she could live in my home town anymore. As someone who was about to be a dad, I had to put my daughter and wife first so I text my work explaining that we had to go back to her town and I wouldn't be coming back to work. 

We found our feet eventually getting small jobs and living at one of her relatives houses until we got a place of our own 1 month before baby arrived. It was a tiring time and a stressful time. I'm not saying g this to get pity ad I realise frankly I'm an emotionally terrible person, but I was thrown into this. We should've used protection to avoid having a kid, and I wouldn't have had that job if we were expecting. Thus not having the stress of moving and being 3 hrs away from my family, only chatting through the end of a phone. My wofe struggled a lot with depression after baby arrived. In fairness it was hard, neither of us knew what we were doing and no matter what I tried to do to help it was always never enough. Taking her out for walks so my wife had some down time, getting up in the night or staying up all night downstairs with her so my wife could get some sleep. A month before baby arrived my job ended up not working out and they laid us redundancy which covered a month. It was 6 months contracted with the premises of continued work but they couldn't stay open much longer. I ended up not working for 8 months until I found a job a christmas. By this point me and my wife were drained. I can't remember the exact arguments truthfully as I can't remember much but we argued semi regularly, not big fights but it was all very one sided. I'd do something wrong, whether it be not tidying the house if my wofe went out and it would be met with furious shouting and a feeling like I'm not good enough.


This is a theme that continues to this day. It is my wife's birthday today and she is upset that there were no small gifts for her from our daughter. Me and my daughter had gone out last month to buy her a new pair of AirPods that cost a lot more than I expected, but I understand it's something she would appreciate as she loves her music and she'd lost her other ones. I'd also order her a special print vinyl from her favourite band, this is still to arrive. The problem that doesn't help me is that I gave her the airpods as we left for our anniversary, something I hind site I should have waited for and given her today. If I had left them until today would she still be annoyed? In total I'd spent £280 on my wofe and it still isn't good enough. So how can I improve? Her big argument this morning was that she does everything and doesn't get any respect. This is true And valid, she puts in a lot of effort to look afte your daughter but I also know that I do to, when I come home I make sure I spend time with her so mum can go upstairs and chill. Arguments like ""I make all of our daughters food, take her places"" is somewhat a lacking argument as she gets older in my opinion. I do make my daughter food when I'm home and able. I woke 9 til 5 5 days a week. But the time I get home she's already done her food. I can't take her out in the middle of the day because I'm working. To all parents out there are these normal standards? 

After not getting her anything for her birthday but still spending what I would think a considerable amount of money on her, I'm at a loss as to what I can do to personally work on myself to become a better parent, husband and person. For our anniversary we said we weren't getting each other anything, as we'd booked a holiday together. I had already started making a piece of art in a frame which commemorated the date we got married, and I told her I didn't expect anything from her, but let her know I wanted to make her something. I also got her a card, which I think, doesn't count as ""getting each other anything"". I didn't receive a card and that did upset me a little bit, as I thought it'd be common sense. However I didn't make a fuss of this. Mainly because I knew that it would be thrown back in my face. The art is still on the counter top of our kitchen with no direction as to where to put it. 

Is an issue potentially that I'm not taking initiative? In the past I've done small things such as bring a coffee up on a morning, but they never got drank. I'd take my daughter downstairs even on a work day in a morning so my wife could have a lie in, with no thanks. I understand that these are all things a parent must do, but then she asks for a different praise when she does them? As if when she does the same things as me it 100x more impressive than when I do it? I also developed depression and anxiety during our relationship, largely due to a job I have now left, however I can't help feel that with the way I'm being spoken to and made to feel, that my wife has a small part to play to. Writing it down I feel terrible as i wouldn't want to pin the blame on her but I'm left to think that I can't do anything right. No matter how hard I try. If I go out of my way to do something it's not appreciated, if I then don't do it because I know it won't be appreciated or I let her decided on what she wants (as then it will defintiley be the correct thing) she tells me she's always organising things. 

I suppose after reflection, am I being narcissistic? Even though I've written out my faults and floors, am I unable to change as I simply don't know how? If anyone understands a word I've put or can relate I'd love to know what you did. I don't want to leave her because she had quite literally become my life. Everything I do revolves around her. The funny thing is 80% it is good of not better and we get on like when we were first dating and it's quite sweet. But that 20% is so angry and makes me feels so depressed I'm struggling ti come up with ideas. There are sometimes I wonder why I don't just take the car and drive 3 hrs back to my parents.

Sometimes, it’s just a whisper in the back of your mind:

What if everything changes tomorrow? What if the worst day of my life is just around the corner?

It’s the kind of thought that sneaks in during ordinary moments—while you're making coffee, scrolling through your phone, or lying in bed trying to fall asleep. It tells you that life is unpredictable, fragile, and that you’re just one phone call, one accident, one diagnosis away from a complete unraveling. And it’s not wrong. Life really can change in a second. That’s what makes this fear feel so heavy—because it’s rooted in truth.

This thought can be paralyzing. It can stop you from enjoying the good days, because you’re bracing for impact. It can make joy feel like a liability, like something dangerous to get too comfortable with. You begin to pre-grieve losses that haven’t happened. You rehearse pain, thinking it might soften the blow if—or when—it comes. But all it really does is steal your peace now, without preventing anything later.

I had a problem with the E4 not producing any coffee despite going through all the motions.
I researched for a while and ended up fixing it by cleaning the micro filter, that you can reach in the center of the machine by removing the tray.

So far so good..

The “problem” is, that after discovering this filter/area and cleaning it regularly, I’m now under the impression, that I get a much better cup of espresso, if I clean the filter/area before every shot.
It is, of course, pretty annoying to clean every time, but I can’t help doing it, now that I “know”.

Question: 
I don’t know the inner workings of this machine. Am I imagining things or could cleaning this filter and surrounding area before every shot actually improve the quality of the coffee drastically??

I don't have kids yet , but I have already decided that because of my adhd-c and (not yet diagnosed, but very much suspected) autism, I'll stick to having one kid. My conditions really make me useless half of the time and I'm very happy to have met someone that is very kind, loving and patient with me. 

I already feel guilty sometimes when my failing executive functioning makes it look like I never seem to get anything done by myself/no motivation from him. Everything just takes so. Much. Energy. I'm already a little stressed about the lack of sleep we'll suffer and how that will affect my overall wellbeing. But for just 1, I hope I can do it. At least I won't have to do it alone.

My partner agrees with me: OAD and some time after birth he'll get himself fixed. No pressure from me, but he offered himself since I'm not allowed to use hormonal birth control anymore. Again, I'm so greatful to have him 🙏 

Financially it would also be the smarter choice because I don't think I'll ever be working fulltime again. Left the 5th job in 5 years last december because I got so overwhelmed again and almost burnt out. I worked there for 1,5 years. Before that I had the same at another job where I worked for 1,5 years. Before that I left a job after 4 months. Before that I left a traineeship position after 1 year. Before that I left customer service after 5 months. Everytime I panicked and couldn't take it anymore. Despite being pretty good and sometimes very good at what I do.

The only job I was able to manage for 2+ years was as a student in a very small coffee shop for travelers and 2+ years as a cassiere in a supermarket for a few hours a week. But those jobs are too understimulating to be doing for years. I didn't need meds to function there though.

Anywho, I'm rambling. Other people that are OAD because of ADHD and/or autism? How are you managing?

Some rare and random days i feel so energetic even tho i had the usual amount of sleep, it does feel so out of place as if i was spiked during sleep but in a good way.

I do have an allergy against weeds so that one is definitely kicking in now and makes things worse. But also in winter when this shouldn't be a problem i so rarely get those good nights of sleep its crazy.
I am doing a sensibilization now against the allergy and hope this to improve life and sleep. 

But i do feel like there is more to it. I did buy a fitbit to track sleep and saw that heartrates and o2 fluctuations are covariant with the wakeups during the night.

I do drink coffee but only in the morning and not after 12pm at all. I do exercise and also average 9k steps a day. Im 25yo and physically in decent shape.

The lack of energy and brain fog really is messing with my life and has made my academic path so much harder. When i have to do difficult things i just feel lethargic and my mind doesn't find the inner energy to focus and get down with things.

""Sounds to me like you're *mostly* dead, Marlene."" Moody chuckled in amusement.

""I'm too tired to deal with this shite.."" She let out a tired sigh.",14,1744541198.0,HPfanfiction,1,0.82,False
1jy4wwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1jy4wwk/facebook_ad_notitle/,Facebook ad no.title,"😲My fiancé fvcked his first love on our wedding bed, I decided to replace him in the wedding.
Everyone thought Terence Keller loved me to the core.
I used to feel the same until I discovered I was merely a substitute for his true love.
After I miscarried because of her, I finally decided to let go.
I called the wedding planner and said, ""Hi, I'd like to change both the wedding venue and the groom's name.""
Then I called my mom. ""Mom, about that arranged marriage you talked to me before? I'm in. I'll be back soon.""

---
""Ms. Poole, just to double-check... Are you going to change the wedding venue and the groom's name?
""My colleague told me you wanted those decorations removed, too. I was worried that she might have misheard...""
Before the wedding planner could continue, Amanda Poole interrupted, ""Yeah. That's what I said.""
The wedding planner was a bit surprised. It was common to have the wedding venue changed, but changing the groom was a first for her.
After a brief pause, she asked, ""Alright then, Ms. Poole. We'll start making arrangements now if that's OK. It's only a month before the wedding, and we gotta hurry up.""
Amanda's eyelashes fluttered slightly as she sensed the wedding planner's tentative tone.
Then she said, ""Alright. Sorry for the trouble.""
After hanging up the phone, she looked up at her reflection in the mirror. She was dressed in a French haute couture diamond-encrusted wedding dress with exquisite makeup and a shining crown, but no trace of joy that a bride-to-be should have could be seen in her eyes at all.
""Ms. Poole? Have you done changing?""
The shop assistant's voice snapped Amanda back to reality, and then she walked out of the fitting room.
The shop assistant's eyes lit up as she saw Amanda in the wedding dress.
Then she praised Amanda enthusiastically. ""You look fabulous, Ms. Poole. It took the designer Mr. Keller hired six months to finally customize the dress, and every detail about it is perfect. Others might be overshadowed by it when wearing it, but not you. You look amazing.""
In the next second, Terence looked over and was amazed.
Even his eyes were glistening with tears.
""Amanda, you're so beautiful. After six years, finally, you're about to be my wife.""
Feeling him holding her hand, Amanda looked up and met his gaze filled with affection.
They started dating when they were students; over the years, they had gone through a lot and still were in deep love, which was something many people were jealous about.
He must have loved her to the core that he was almost bursting into tears when seeing her in a wedding dress.
She would have fallen for his facade if not for that incident.
Terence asked her with concern, ""Is the headpiece too heavy? I know you think it's troublesome, but we only get to take wedding photos once in this lifetime, right? You can take that off after the shoting.""
""Gee, you're like the most loving couple I've ever seen,"" the staff sighed. Then she reminded them, ""Shall we go take the photos now? The photographer is ready.""
Before Amanda could say no, Terence's phone rang.
He glanced at his phone screen, and his expression changed slightly. Then he subconsciously turned off the screen. Though he did it quickly, Amanda still saw that name on the screen—Abigail.
Smiling, Terence put his phone away, let go of her hand, and said casually, ""Just a second. I'll go make a call.""
Before she could say anything, he had already stridden away. After a few minutes, he came back, looking troubled. ""Amanda, something came up at work. I'm afraid we can't do this today. Can we reschedule?""
The staff said, ""Mr. Keller, there won't be enough time...""
Amanda remained silent, but Terence took her reaction as agreement. He put her bag on the table and then lowered his head to kiss her.
She gripped the hem of the dress so hard that her nails dug into her palms, hurting her, yet she tilted her head away expressionlessly as if she hadn't felt pain at all.
""Go on then, if you're in a hurry,"" she said flatly.
Terence was slightly surprised that she dodged his kiss; figuring that she was throwing a tantrum, he smiled helplessly.
""Amanda, you're like a baby as ever. I'm sorry. I promise I'll be with you no matter what comes up.""
She looked at his retreating figure and then lowered her head, smiling self-mockingly. It turned out she was the only one looking forward to this carefully prepared wedding.
Amanda knew it was coming, but seeing that wedding dress, she couldn't help but feel sarcastic.
At first, she wanted to put a nice end to their six-year relationship.
But now, she suddenly had a change of mind.
She'd vanish totally from Terence's life along with all the traces proving they had been in love.
Looking at her, the staff said hesitantly, ""Ms. Poole, would you like to continue with the dress fitting?""
She nodded. ""Of course. Bring out the most expensive ones.
""Even without him here, I'm still gonna get married.""
 
Chapter 2 Memories
After trying on the wedding dresses, Amanda walked out of the bridal shop, and the sky had already darkened. She stood on the roadside hailing for a cab when she heard the whispers from passers-by.
""It's the 9th today. No wonder there are so many people out on the streets. On the evening of this day every month, Mr. Keller will put on a drone light show for his fiancée. It's become a popular check-in spot in L.A.""
""Indeed. Mr. Keller and his fiancée love each other so much. They say that he auctioned off a huge diamond ring for her some time ago, right? It cost him a fortune. There aren't many perfect men like him these days.""
""Look! The show has begun.""
Hearing their exclamations, Amanda looked up, only to see dozens of drones in the sky not far away. The drones first formed ""T loves A"" and then transformed into two little figures.
Amidst everyone's sighs, Amanda lowered her head, her eyes brimming with tears as bitterness filled her heart.
On the surface, Terence was very nice to her, and he was always so generous when it came to money. So, everyone, including her, believed that he loved her to the core.
But now she realized the letter ""A"" probably stood for Abigail instead of Amanda. She came from a rich family and had always been surrounded by suitors ever since she was a student. But she wasn't interested in relationships; also, her parents had a verbal engagement arranged for her. So, she had never said yes to anyone.
Then she met Terence.
Compared to the others, he wasn't exactly outstanding. When they met, he was just a poor student with good grades, and he had never confessed his feelings for her. He'd just put a cup of coffee on her desk every morning.
Once, she said casually that she wanted the cupcakes from the brand ""Chef's Choice"", and he saved up for a long time before buying some and having one of their classmates give them to her.
She suffered from menstrual pain, so he put painkillers on her desk during those few days.
Occasionally, when she forgot to finish her homework, he'd do it for her by copying her handwriting.
When she found out about it, she said he didn't have to do this, but he stubbornly continued.
She wasn't a cold robot or a machine and gradually wavered under his relentless pursuit.
And he had never let her down. After they got together, he always treated her as the most precious treasure in the world. Even during his startup days, no matter how poor he was, he'd buy her all kinds of small gifts because he knew romance meant a lot to her.
When he proposed to her, he even offered to transfer his company shares to her.
That day, he looked at her sincerely. ""Amanda, I wanna provide you with the utmost sense of security. Will you marry me?""
Smiling, she cried and nodded.
But she didn't accept the shares because his love for her was the only thing she wanted.
She had thought they'd live happily together forever.
However, she forgot that people changed.
A month ago, she found out that he had a lover.
They went shopping together, looking no different from a couple in love. The way he protected her head when she got into the car reminded Amanda of the way he had protected her back in the day.
Back then, Amanda had asked him why he chose the 9th of every month for the drone show.
He said it was the day he started having feelings for her. But now she knew it was the day he and his lover got together officially.
She looked down at the diamond ring in her bag, closing her eyes bitterly.
Now that he had broken his promise, why should she cling to it?
That night, Terence came home very late.
He was slightly surprised to see her packing in the living room.
He said, his voice a bit deep, ""Amanda, why aren't you asleep yet? Are you still upset about the sh0oting? I'm sorry, but it was urgent, and I had to go.""
While coaxing her, he took out a cake box behind him and smiled, making a joke, ""Or are you staying up late because you know I went to buy you your favorite cake?""
When he leaned closer to her, she saw the hlckeys on his neck, and the perfume he used to mask the scent sickened her.
Her heart ached, and she dodged from his embrace.
She didn't want to be anywhere near him, not after he just had sax with someone else.
Terence was stunned; then he saw her grim face.
He asked, ""Are you feeling unwell, Amanda? You look so pale.""
She forced a smile. ""No, I'm not. I was just thinking about things.""
He tapped her nose gently, not dwelling on it.
""You focus on the wedding too much. Leave the rest to the staff, OK? I'm so looking forward to waiting for my beautiful bride on the red carpet.""
His sweet nothings didn't cheer her up at all.
Since she had decided to replace the groom, of course, there wouldn't be a wedding for them.
 
Chapter 3 A Lie
The next morning, Amanda woke up and saw Terence, who was adjusting his attire in front of the mirror.
She loved seeing him in a shirt, so he dressed simply most of the time. But today, he dressed so flamboyantly.
Noticing that she was awake, he instinctively walked over and kissed her lips. But she tilted her face, and he ended up pecking her forehead.
He didn't mind; instead, he smiled and continued to pick a tie.
In the next second, the screen of his phone on the nightstand lit up, and since he didn't lock it, she saw a chatting interface.
The contact name was ""Honey"", and the message Honey sent was, ""You're so bad. Why were you so eager last night? I just bought the dress, and you ruined it. What am I supposed to wear today?""
So, the reason why he dressed up today was that he had a date. Feeling bitter, Amanda suddenly realized it wasn't the WhatsApp account he usually used.
Before she could dwell on it, Terence had already walked over to the bedside. He subconsciously glanced at the nearly dimmed phone screen and pulled a long face.
""Did you snoop on my phone?"" he asked.
Looking at how angry he was, she suddenly remembered that back then, he had her fingerprint recorded on his phone and said he had no secrets from her.
He knew she never checked his phone but still had an alt account. Was it because he was worried that she might find out?
With that thought, she looked up at him, feeling puzzled. If he still cared about her, why did he cheat on her?
How much of his love was real? Did he still love her at all? She had no idea.
After he left, she sent home several suitcases she had prepared the night before.
Then she sorted out things that were related to him and planned on donating them.
Six years wasn't exactly a short time; before she realized it, the villa had already been filled with their memories.
Back then, they agreed to make this villa their wedding place, and then Terence transferred it to her name. Now that she was determined to make a clean break with him, of course, she wouldn't want the villa.
Taking the documents, she went to the registration office to transfer the villa.
The staff asked, ""You'll receive the new property certificate in about a week or so. Would you like to come here to pick it up, or do you want us to mail it to you?""
She said, ""Mail it to this address.""
She figured that the day Terence received the property certificate would be the second day after she left, and she hoped he liked this gift.
He was indeed considerate, and there was always a gift for her on anniversaries or holidays. But he was also so careless that when they were choosing the wedding venue, he simply left her with a black card and told her to pick a site she liked. And then, he never asked about it. Now she knew it was because his attention had been attracted by someone else.
She unconsciously tightened her grip on the bag. Sadness mixed with disappointment made her feel dizzy.
She stood outside in the wind for a long time and then went to the class reunion. When she was about to push open the door to the private room, she heard teases.
""You've put on wedding rings already? When are you getting married? This year, maybe?""
""Terence, come on. Abigail has always been the one you love, right? Then why did you date Amanda? Now that everyone has known, and it's troublesome to break up with her.""
""Terence, I'm so surprised that you've had a crush on Abigail for so long. Now that she has come back, you can finally pick up where you left off.""
Noticing the displeased look on Terence's face, Abigail Hawkins quickly said sweetly while leaning against his arms, ""I don't think a title matters a lot. Anything is fine as long as he loves me.""
Terence echoed, smiling while lowering his head to kiss her, ""You know I can give you everything besides marriage.""
The others realized they had said the wrong thing and quickly said, ""Yeah, marriage is just a formality. Abigail, you're the only one Terence has ever loved. Guys like him are rare creatures these days. You've got great taste in men.""
Standing outside the door, Amanda was stupefied by what she had heard, feeling as if her blood had frozen.
Terence and Abigail got together before this year?
In other words, her relationship with Terence was a complete lie ever since the beginning.
All those sweet moments and happy memories suddenly turned into a big hand, slapping her face hard and destroying the last bit of her rationality.
Back then, Terence said he had nothing but his love for her; he promised he'd love her and protect her forever. So, she willingly chose to stay by his side when he started from scratch.
It wasn't until now that she realized she was the only one who took their six-year relationship seriously.
Until a passing waiter handed her a tissue tentatively, she realized she was crying.
She wiped her tears away and pushed open the door.
Hearing the sound, Terence instinctively pushed Abigail away, looking flustered.
""Amanda? When did you get here?""
 
Chapter 4 His Promise
Everyone paused for a second, then quickly invited the two to sit down.
""Amanda, what brings you here today? We invited you several times, but Terence refused.""
Amanda was pulled to sit next to Terence. But before she could speak, Terence took her fork and wiped it, then brought her a plate of fruit.
Terence replied with a smile, ""Of course, I won't show my girlfriend to you guys. Amanda, try this. It's your favorite orange.""
Amanda remained silent, not wanting to join their act. ""I suddenly remember I have something else to do. Please enjoy your meal. I'll leave first.""
Terence quickly held her hand, frowning.
""Where are you going? I'll give you a ride.""
Abigail kept silent, and she suddenly said with a smile, ""Amanda probably looks down on us, right? She never came to our party after graduation, and now she thinks a meal is a waste of time.""
""Yes, Amanda. We rarely get together. Why do you rush to leave?""
""We and Abigail have only been in the same class for a year, but she came to our party every time. Come on! Terence is here too. Are you leaving to see another man?""
They seemed to think it was funny, and they continued to talk about this, ""Which man is better than our Terence? Is that man so hot?""
""Come on! Amanda is a rich girl. She can date different types of men if she wants. Who says she can only date one man?""
Seeing Abigail's provoccative face, Amanda felt disgusted.
""Enough! Amanda is my fiancée. Your jokes are too much! Mind your own business!""
Terence's expression was serious with real anger, and he quickly comforted Amanda with a gentle tone.
""Let's go home.""
Amanda suddenly felt a bit wistful, as if back to the time when Terence used to protect her.
But in the next second, Abigail suddenly fell to the ground with a scream.
Terence immediately turned to chase after Abigail, saying, ""Amanda, wait me for a second.""
""OK. Go ahead.""
Terence frowned and then really left.
Amanda sneered. His love was really cheap.
Amanda's phone rang. She looked down, receiving a text message from an unknown number.
""Let him go. He doesn't love you. What's the point of forcing him to stay with you? Tomorrow is your birthday. Dare to make a bet? Guess if he will be with you or in my bed?""
Amanda smiled lightly, replying quickly this time.
""OK, I bet with you.""
""If I lose, you can take him away. If I win, I'll also let him go to you.""
At the same time, Abigail felt a bit strange. She frowned and thought, ""This woman was crazy?""
Amanda didn't receive a further reply, and she smiled mockingly.
When the prize of victory was no longer attractive, winning or losing was also meaningless.
She wouldn't compromise this time.
At midnight, Amanda's phone started vibrating.
She received so many birthday wishes, from family, friends, and business partners, and she even received the generous money transfer from her mysterious fiancé.
Only Terence was missing.
Even though Amanda was ready for that, she still felt heartbroken.
Where was Terence? Abigail quickly gave her the answer.
In the photo, the man was kneling on the ground, carefully tending to Abigail's leg wound.
""As long as I get a little hurt, I can call him over. Amanda, why are you so worthless?""
Amanda turned off her phone, looking at the wedding photo on the bedside. Her heart was numb.
In the photo, she was holding a bouquet of white lilies. She was embraced by a man full of love.
Terence used to promise her, ""The white lily's meaning is 'loyalty and unity, forever together', symbolizing pure and flawless love, just like you and me. Amanda, I only love you in this life. I will never let you down.""
Now his promise was given to someone else, as well as his love.
 
Chapter 5 Hurt
Every year, Terence would hold a birthday party for Amanda, and this year was no exception.
Amanda sat in front of the mirror, listening to the crowd's envious praise, but she was so calm.
""Mr. Keller is so sweet to you. He ordered custom jewelry this year, and I heard it's so expensive. You must be the most dazzling woman tonight.""
""Yes, Mr. Keller spends a lot of money every year. Everyone in L.A. knows how sweet Mr. Keller and Ms. Poole are. It's really enviable.""
The makeup artist stopped what she was doing. She smiled and cut off her assistant's words, reminding Amanda, ""OK, Ms. Poole, hurry up and change your clothes. I heard the guests arrive.""
Amanda changed her dress and went downstairs, seeing everyone gathered together.
Abigail was in a sky-blue dress. Terence's suit was in the same color. They stand together at the center of the circle of people, shining like stars.
Someone noticed Amanda and whispered a few words, and the crowd dispersed instantly.
Amanda's face was expressionless as if she didn't see the two people quickly stop holding hands and Terence's slightly nervous movements.
Terence came to welcome her. He smiled and said, ""Amanda, you're so stunning tonight.""
Terence coaxed Amanda over. ""Well, it's time for our host to start the ceremony. Remember the champagne you liked when we traveled last time? I used it for the champagne tower this year. You'll love it.""
Amanda staggered for a moment. So, Terence worked so hard to prepare this.
Amanda opened her mouth, trying to say something. Maybe they can end their relationship on good terms. But then Terence suddenly glanced at his phone. His expression slightly changed.
Amanda got silent. She turned to start the party herself.
She took the wine, and stood on the stage, looking at Terence. He quietly left with Abigail. A mocking smile was on Abigail's face.
Amanda didn't know if she should say Terence was brave. He can take the risk for Abigail.
The crowd's envious praise turned into sharp sarcasm.
""Mr. Keller spent so much on his fiancée. Even the wine is made to her taste. It's really a sweet couple.""
Amanda lowered her eyes, pouring wine into the champagne tower. After a round of applause, people came over to talk to her.
When the party was over, she leaned on the table. When she looked up, she found Abigail standing on the stairs.
Abigail showed a smug smile, walking downstairs step by step towards Amanda. Abigail's face flushed, eyes full of desire and joy.
Amanda looked at her approaching. Abigail had an ambiguous smile. ""I helped you try the wedding room. The bed is very solid and very soft.""
Amanda went limp, feeling dizzy and disgusting.
Seeing Terence coming over, Abigail whispered in Amanda's ear, ""Just give up. He never belonged to you.""
Abigail suddenly cried, ""Amanda, I know you blame me for taking Terence away last time, but I really want to apologize to you...""
After saying that, she held Amanda's hand, forcing herself backward, hitting the champagne tower on the table.
When Amanda realized what was happening, Abigail was already lying in the broken glass, covered in blood.
Terence rushed over in a panic, pushing Amanda aside. ""Abigail! Are you OK? Don't be afraid, I'm here!""
Ignoring the guests who looked over, Terence held Abigail in pain, looking at Amanda with disappointment.
""Amanda, I know you don't like Abigail, but how could you do this!""
 
Chapter 6 Heartbreak
Amanda winced in pain. Her waist hit the corner of the table, sending sharp pain through her abd0men. She collapsed onto the broken glass, blood instantly staining the floor. Amanda couldn't tell if it was her body or her heart that hurt more.
""It wasn't me. You can check the surveillance.""
She looked at the pale and unconscious Abigail, then looked at the anxious Terence. Amanda asked with tears in her eyes, ""Do you not trust me at all?""
""Terence, let's break up.""
It seemed Terence couldn't bear to see Amanda's painful expression, but he quickly hardened his resolve.
""Amanda, don't be angry. I don't want to doubt you, but there's no one else here, and she was hurt at your birthday party. No matter what happened, we should be responsible for her.""
After saying this, Terence realized Abigail in his arms already fainted. His face turned anxious.
""Abigail has a special blood type. Getting a little hurt can be life-threatening. She wouldn't dare to frame you by using her life, right? This time is your fault. I won't blame you. But stop your nonsense. I'll take her to the hospital first!""
Terence strode away, leaving the party behind, and once again leaving Amanda behind.
The guests watched this scene with strange and sympathetic eyes. It hurt Amanda deeply.
Amanda's forehead was covered in sweat, and then she couldn't control herself to faint.
She woke up in the hospital. The doctor checked her wound, but she still felt very dizzy and uncomfortable.
The doctor spoke with some pity, ""Ms. Poole, I'm sorry we failed to save your child.""
Amanda stared blankly at the ceiling. She unconsciously put her hands on her abdommen. She once had a child here.
Tears filled her face. She finally couldn't hold back her laughter.
How ridiculous! Today should be the happiest day of her life, but in the end, her child died because of its father.
But seeing her current relationship with Terence, perhaps losing the child was the best choice.
After receiving the mis carriage form, Amanda ignored the pain and pulled out the needle. She saw countless missed calls, but she also ignored them.
She was about to leave the hospital, but she suddenly stopped.
Amanda saw Terence was holding Abigail. His voice was nervous.
""Can you stay in the hospital another day? Those glass pieces were just taken out, and it takes time to recover.""
""I want to go back to our home. And...you don't wanna have sax with me?"" Abigail asked Terence, looking at him shyly. Then she pretended to be sad. ""There has been a lot of negative coverage about Amanda in the media. You should go to comfort her.""
Terence's throat tightened. He leaned down and kissed Abigail, then gasped, ""I've already called to clear things up with her over the phone. This time is all her fault.""
Terence whispered something to Abigail, causing both their faces to flush with desire.
Amanda looked up, tears welling up in her eyes. She painfully watched the two people's intimacy.
When Amanda wanted out of the hospital, she immediately saw the two people being stopped by the media outside.
Seeing Amanda wrapped in a bandage in the hospital, Terence first felt nervous, then quickly attracted by the woman in his arms. He turned to yell at Amanda.
""Why didn't you answer the phone? Didn't I tell you to explain everything early? How could the media suddenly come to the hospital? I really didn't expect you to be so malicious!
""Abigail just got out of the hospital. She can't handle the media. You have to solve this yourself!""
Amanda was too stunned to react and was pushed out the door by Terence, quickly overwhelmed by the reporters.
In front of her were hands reaching out, microphones hitting her body and forehead, Amanda's head throbbing with pain, and she saw Terence holding Abigail leaving.
Amanda sneered. Even if she was already disappointed, she still felt heartbroken at this moment.
Fortunately, there were only two days left.
 
Chapter 7 Leaving
The public was very interested in their relationship, so many reporters came here.
Amanda was pushed by the crowd. Her already pale face got even colder. Surrounded by endless questions, she had no answer. She could only dodge, looking miserable.
Amanda saw Terence on the news until that night.
The video showed her desperately dodging the cameras on the one hand and showed Terence clarifying to the public on the other hand. He was handsome in a suit. This was quite ironic.
""My relationship with Amanda is very stable, and our wedding is in a couple of days. Thank you all for your concern.""
Amanda closed her eyes, feeling quite desolate in this big villa.
Her phone buzzed. Abigail sent her a photo of two people kissing under the fireworks.
""Look at this. He only cares about me. He was afraid I was not happy, so he took me to set off fireworks. And he just used you to protect me.""
That was why Terence didn't clarify during the daytime because he took Abigail to the suburbs.
Amanda stared at the photo for a while, suddenly remembering the scenes when they just started to date.
At that time, Terence wanted to surprise her, so he worked overtime for a month, saving money to take her to Disneyland to see the fireworks.
He always said his love was not enough. His Amanda deserved the best.
They kissed in the night, telling each other their love. They were full of pas-sion.
Now he could easily give a grand firework to others. His love also instantly faded like fireworks.
Terence had done a lot for Amanda before, but she no longer wanted to doubt who he really cared about.
Since she didn't care, how could she be hurt again?
Terence came back the next day. Seeing Amanda become thin, his face was full of worry.
""Amanda, how did you get hurt like this? Yesterday I didn't notice you. It was my fault. But Abigail was hurt because of you. I can't leave her alone.""
Terence came over to hold Amanda. He thought she might hurt herself to irritate him. He continued to speak, ""I asked the chef to make a nutritious meal. You should eat and take care of yourself. You said you want to take some wedding photos. Let's go today, OK?""
Amanda was pulled to sit at the table, unable to refuse.
But the meal was not ready yet, and Terence's phone suddenly vibrated. He looked at Amanda apologetically.
""It's probably something with the company. I'll handle it first.""
After Terence left, he didn't come back again. He just sent a message saying he suddenly had to deal with some work.
Amanda didn't ask and just looked at the chat history Abigail sent her.
""It seems like the media is following me. I'm scared. Did I cause you trouble?""
""Don't worry. I'll come up now.""
Amanda didn't know if Terence was worried about the exposure of their affair or if Abigail couldn't handle the media. No matter which situation it was, this made her seem pathetic.
She took a deep breath, silently wiping away all traces of her life in the villa.
She packed all the things she could take and donated the rest of them. Looking at all her photos with Terence burned, Amanda felt relieved.
She turned on her new phone and sent the flight information to her family. Amanda put her old phone with all their chat history, the mis carriage form, and printed photos on the bed. Then she picked up her suitcase and left.
This villa was once full of love and memories. But now, staying here made her sick.
Amanda left and didn't look back again.
On the way to the airport, Amanda saw Terence going back to the villa. His car was parked by the roadside. Even the car door was not closed. Abigail cried in his arms. It looked like they just went through a fight.
It had nothing to do with her now. Amanda calmly raised the window. Her gaze no longer stopped for Terence.
Terence's heart suddenly slowed, as if feeling something. He looked back, but only saw a strange black car.
He unconsciously called out, ""Amanda...""
In his arms, Abigail was frozen. She hid the resentment in her eyes, saying with a trembling voice, ""Are they all gone? Did I cause you trouble?""
Terence turned back to Abigail and comforted her, ""I'm here. Don't worry. I'll take you back now.""
Amanda looked at the rearview mirror, seeing the two shrinking figures, and then closed her eyes for a second.
Terence, never see you again.
 
Chapter 8 Go to France
After driving Abigail home, Terence planned to leave. But he didn't expect Abigail to suddenly hug his waist. Her voice sounded upset.
""Can't you stay a little longer?""
Terence looked at her pale face with affection, gently kissing her forehead. His eyes were filled with apology.
""I promised to take wedding photos with Amanda today. I'll come over tonight.""
Abigail didn't care about Terence's words and kissed him. ""Don't leave.""
Terence's eyes darkened, and his throat tightened. He lifted Abigail's chin again. ""OK, I won't leave.""
They both lay on the bed. Abigail raised her head with desire. Her tone was full of jealousy.
""It's said that a woman looks most beautiful when she wears a wedding dress. When will you take photos with me?""
She blew on Terence's ear and whispered, ""I'll wear the wedding dress for you, OK?""
Terence got harder.
""You naughty girl, let's go tomorrow.""
The next morning, Terence was awakened by a phone call.
""Mr. Keller, you have a package. Can you come out and sign for it?""
Terence frowned. ""What package?""
""It's about property...""
A woman's arm fell on Terence's abd0men, and she grumbled unhappily, interrupting the conversation.
""I was exhausted last night, and now you're disturbing my sleep.""
Terence took out his phone and kissed her gently.
""It's OK. Just continue sleeping.""
Then he casually said to the phone, ""Put it in the security room.""
Without waiting for a response, Terence breathed heavily. He couldn't wait to hang up, holding Abigail's restless hand.
""It seems you don't need to rest.""
""Ah...""
In just a moment, the man's heavy breathing and the woman's moans started again.
On the other side, the plane finally landed in Paris. When Amanda stepped out, she immediately saw her parents waiting outside the airport.
She used to think she was numb and wouldn't have any emotions again.
But at this moment, she burst into tears, and all her grievances exploded.
""Dad, Mom...""
They all saw the news in America. Even if the family was abroad, they could see what happened from the news.
Seeing their daughter like this, Anne and Brynn almost cried. They were heartbroken.
""It's great to see you come back. We won't let you suffer that pain anymore.
""We can't support you for the rest of our life.""
Amanda cried, nodding. ""Dad, Mom, I'm sorry.""
She insisted on staying in America to support Terence in his business and didn't visit her parents for several years.
Now thinking about it, Amanda felt really guilty as a daughter.
Anne comforted Amanda all the way home. When they arrived home, Anne suddenly changed the topic.
""Baby girl, the marriage you promised before...""
Amanda hesitated for a moment and pressed her lips.
She no longer believed in love, so she naturally didn't care about marrying anyone, and this marriage was still beneficial to the family.
But she was heartbroken now. She was afraid she couldn't treat that fiancé very well.
Seeing her troubled expression, Anne realized what Amanda was thinking and quickly said, ""I mean, that person is now at our home.""
Amanda raised her head, and she just saw a figure coming out of the living room. She was slightly stunned.
The man was not yet thirty, wearing a custom-made black suit. He had very good shape, with a good-looking face, exuding a unique maturity and composure.
Seeing Amanda, the man's eyes instantly filled with joy.
""Amanda.""
Tears came to Amanda's eyes. She showed her first smile in recent times.
""Calvin.""
Amanda didn't expect her parents' arranged marriage partner for her to be Calvin.
 
Chapter 9 Before the Wedding
Amanda and Calvin grew up together. Calvin was three years older than Amanda, so he treated her like a little girl, always looking after her.
During Amanda's teenage years, she had a crush on Calvin, but she never had the chance to express her feelings before hearing about the news of their family's immigration.
After going abroad, Calvin still occasionally sent her some gifts, but as they grew older and moved several times, they gradually lost touch.
Later, when Amanda and Terence were together, she was against her family's opposition, and then they completely lost contact.
It was more than ten years ago. Amanda didn't expect that they would meet again.
Anne looked at the two of them, smiling and patting Amanda's hand.
""Thanks to Calvin. He helped us so much these past few years, so we can settle in Paris. We'll go to cook first. I'll leave you to chat.""
Calvin didn't mention their engagement, just walking with Amanda in the garden. His voice was gentle.
""What are your plans for the future? Are you going to continue studying or start a business? I remember you said you wanted to apply to a graduate program at the University of Paris.""
Amanda was lost in thought. Over the past six years, she so focused on Terence and finally lost herself.
""I plan to continue the study first. I have some ideas for starting a business, but I'm not in a hurry.""
Amanda was influenced by her parents. They took her to business dinners since she was young. And after starting the business with Terence, Amanda felt she could run her own company.
She just needed some time to recover after going through the relationship with Terence.
Calvin gently patted her head, and said humorously, ""You're still so young, don't frown all the time. Don't worry about what you want to do. If you decide to apply to the university, I can ask a professor to write a recommendation letter for you.""
The value of a recommendation letter for applying to a university was unimaginable.
Amanda nodded gratefully, not refusing Calvin's kindness.
""Thank you, Calvin.""
Amanda's parents called them for dinner. They smiled at each other and stopped the conversation.
At the same time in America, Terence didn't know Amanda's leaving. He was still obsessed with Abigail.
On the third day before the wedding, Terence and Abigail took wedding photos.
On the second day before the wedding, Terence and Abigail went to a church to pray that they could be together forever.
On the eve of the wedding, Terence took Abigail to a beach.
Some people recognized Terence, and then he found Amanda didn't contact him for several days.
Terence was used to Amanda's daily messages and reminders. When he clicked the chatting box with Amanda, he suddenly felt a sense of nervousness. His heart skipped a beat.
""Amanda, I'm back from work today. Is there anything you want to eat?""
After sending the message, Terence finally felt at ease to persuade himself.
He ignored Amanda a few days ago about the problems of the media. Amanda must still be upset. Tomorrow was the wedding, so nothing could go wrong.
But Terence already promised Abigail to see the sunrise tomorrow. He checked the schedule and called the wedding company.
""The wedding tomorrow will be delayed by an hour.""
The staff were surprised and hesitantly said, ""But Mr. Keller, your wedding with Ms. Poole...""
The staff didn't finish the sentence, and Abigail walked over in a bikini. She took Terence's hand to touch her body, and said coquettishly, ""Terence, help me with sunscreen.""
Terence's eyes darkened, and he picked up Abigail, rushing to hang up the phone and head to the hotel room.
After they had sax, Abigail nestled in Terence's arms, her eyes slightly red.
""Tomorrow you're going to marry her. Will you still love me?""
Terence's heart softened, and he kissed Abigail's lips.
""Good girl, whatever you want, I'll give it to you.""
Abigail turned to Terence. Her fingers touched his heart.
""I want your heart. Are you willing to give it to me?""
Terence smiled, ""Haven't I given it to you already? I'll watch the sunrise with you tomorrow morning and then go to the wedding venue.""
""Alright."" Abigail kissed him. ""That's your reward.""
They stayed up until midnight. The next day, Terence went to watch the sunrise with Abigail, drove her home, and then changed his clothes and rushed to the wedding venue.",1,1744541182.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1. Dr Elmie is well known in NUS and many of the students and staff seen him and know him, very approachable. Unlike Dr Jamus Lim, those whom I asked who are working or studying in Essec business school, none knew who Dr Lim was and no one ever seen Dr Jamus in Essec before! So much about his credentials. 

2. Ever since WP won SKGRC, from any part of the constituency, booking a ride from those apps seems to be more expensive and surge 24/7, the same ride in PAP wards cost way lesser even when surge. A ride between Sengkang GRC and Changi Airport costs at least $25 across all apps 24/7, but from Fernvale or Yishun, it costs no more than $24. 

3. WP harped so much about high COL, but they are not even interested in doing the monthly $1 deal like what those PAP wards are doing, hello, Sengkang residents are not rich either. 

4. Food at coffee shops, hawker centre and neighbourhood shops costs more than other places. This is probably due to less competition, even going to childcare, tuition centres and clinic have to be at a common area. 

5. A serious lack of shopee drop off points, drivers always don’t show up or deliver parcels late, even while people are sleeping during midnight. My friends who live in Fernvale or Yishun don’t receive their parcels so late at night!

6. Ever since WP won Sengkang, the people living in Sengkang are getting rude, inconsiderate. 

7. The MPs claimed to have been doing house visits, but they only visit those household who voted WP, as long as you have one member in the household voted PAP, the WP MPs will not visit your house and ignore your request. 

8. The rubbish collection service comes only once a day, and it’s erratic, they are not working on weekends and PHs, 5 days work week. My friends in PAP wards told me their garbage truck can go collect rubbish 3 times per day even on weekends and PHs.

So please, do not vote WP anymore in SKGRC, what I said here is absolutely true and the SK residents can concur with that. ",0,1744541003.0,SingaporeRaw,10,0.06,False

1jy4u7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jy4u7t/the_desperate_single_woman/,The Desperate Single Woman,"Abby, age 34, never had a boyfriend, not even an admirer. She almost gave up and accept this misery. She avoided watching romantic movies, she only watch action movies or anything that has limited romantic scenes in it. She avoided looking at couples during Valentine's Day. When she sees her friends with their partners she tried her best to not feel bitter. She was the one adjusting to the romantic world, what else can she do?

One day the happiest moment in her life came. Her friend introduced her to Bingo. A 35 year old unattractive unemployed guy shorter than her.

""H-Hi, Abby. I-I'm Bingo. Can I g-get to know you?"" Even the way he talked was 0 charisma. But to Abby, he's the most beautiful man. The man who accepted her. The first man to show a little bit of interest to her.

""Yes, it's ok."" Abby can't control her happiness, it's clearly showing from her face. ""Let's have a date. T-this afternoon. Y-you want?"" Bingo asked. Abby said yes excitedly.

Afternoon came and the new couple went to a coffee shop. Bingo went to one of the empty tables.

""BAM!!"" He slammed his face on the table. Blood came out of his lip and he grabbed something from inside his mouth. He gave a tooth to Abby.

""Keep that. By the way I'm heading out. I feel kinda sleepy."" He left the coffee shop leaving Abby standing in shock. Everybody saw it too, silence and gasps filled the shop, the staffs stopped doing what they're doing.

Abby left the shop still holding Bingo's tooth. She went inside her car and looked straight still trying to understand what was going on.

She took a small plastic container and put Bingo's tooth in. She thought of keeping it. No matter how disturbing, she was actually happy Bingo gave something for her to keep.

One Tuesday morning Bingo messaged her. ""Let's meet this afternoon again. I'm excited again to see you."" Abby replied yes.

In this second date Bingo took her to the park. He was holding a red flat gift box and gave it to Abby. ""Open it.""

Abby opened the box. It contained an index finger, already smells bad and rotten.

""Keep that too. And I'm gonna go now. My mom is sick today."" Bingo left again. She's now alone sitting on the bench, closing the box slowly and shaking.

When she got home she took the tooth from the plastic and put it together in the box with the finger. She put the box on her table beside her bed. She felt disturbed, but the disturbance was also covered with thankfulness and joy because she's not single anymore. And hey, she even received gifts!

Morning comes and her friend Jane, the one who introduced her to Bingo, called her. ""Abby, I hate to say this,"" Jane's voice was shaking, ""Bingo, he's... he's dead. A car ran over him!"" Abby don't know how to feel about it.

Abby and Jane attended the funeral. Abby remained silent. She now understand everything, she heard from the mourners about Bingo's weirdness and his very bizarre mental condition but they have no idea how worse it can get. She looked at the large photo of Bingo, he's smiling sweetly there. Abby remembered those very short times she spent with him. He gave her the experience of having a boyfriend even in a very short period of time. Without realizing it, Abby's tears started to form. Her eyes squinted, her lips quivered, she sobbed. She bowed her head wiping her tears and sobbed uncontrollably. Jane rubbed her back and finally she leaned on her shoulder and cried helplessly.

After the funeral Jane proceed to comfort her. They gave their farewell hugs and went separate ways.

When she got home she was so weak. She went to her room not showing a sign of energy and life. She sat on her bed and grabbed the box. She opened it and looked at the tooth and finger closely. She noticed some markings on the tooth.

She grabbed a magnifying glass and observed the writtings on the tooth.

*I love you*

She was stunned. She now grabbed the finger next. Tears started falling from her eyes again. Inside the finger there was a folded small paper in it. She took it and unfolded it.

It was a sketch. Bingo drew them sitting in the grass in front of a tree.

Abby covered her mouth and her eyes closed squeezing out mournful tears.

She felt devastated not giving any present to Bingo. But it's not too late, isn't it? She can lay the gift on Bingo's grave if she will ever give one.

She looked in the mirror and smiled. And then she looked at her fingers. She went to the kitchen and grabbed a plier and a butcher knife.",3,1744540870.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Right off the bat, I appreciated the clean interface. Everything is laid out clearly, so getting started was easy. I used it mostly for downloading tracks from Spotify and YouTube Music, and it handled both quite well. The App Mode works directly with the installed apps, while the Web Player Mode captures from the browser. Both were surprisingly stable, and I didn’t notice a major difference in quality between the two.

What really stood out was the ability to convert to multiple formats — MP3, FLAC, AAC, WAV, etc. — and maintain high quality. ID3 tags were preserved almost perfectly, which is a big deal for me when organizing large libraries. It also has some bonus features like burning CDs and converting local files, which are nice to have, though not essential.

On the downside, it’s expensive. The monthly plan at nearly $30 is steep, and even the lifetime plan feels pricey unless you’re using it regularly. There are also some grey areas with using tools like this — Spotify doesn’t exactly encourage users to rip music, and there have been reports of accounts being flagged. So, I’d be cautious, especially with heavy use.

Another minor gripe: the speed isn’t consistent. Some albums downloaded in minutes, others took much longer even with a stable connection.

In short, **Note Burner Music One** delivers on what it promises: a reliable way to download and convert music across platforms. If you’re a power user and okay with the ethical/legal implications, it’s a solid tool. Just be prepared to pay a premium for that convenience. Check it out here!
