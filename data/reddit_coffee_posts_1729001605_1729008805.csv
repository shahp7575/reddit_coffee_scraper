Short Bible Study with me about Galatians 3:11

Introduction
------------

Welcome, dear reader! Today, we’re diving into an exhilarating exploration of faith and righteousness. Imagine a life where the burden of meeting every single rule and standard is lifted, where living with authenticity and freedom comes naturally. Does that spark something within you? The beautiful message in Galatians 3:11 invites us into such a life—one filled with promise and hope through faith. We’re here to unpack this transformative truth in a way that enlivens your day-to-day journey. So grab your coffee, find a comfy spot, and let’s delve into the heart of this encouraging verse!

Have you ever found yourself overwhelmed with trying to measure up to expectations? Let today be the day we embrace something different—a life oriented around faith. This study is not just about understanding a verse but discovering the essence of living freely through God’s eyes. Let’s see what wonders unfold as we look into Galatians 3:11, uncover its meaning, and glean practical steps to apply this living truth.

Bible Verse
-----------

“Clearly no one who relies on the law is justified before God, because ‘the righteous will live by faith.'” — Galatians 3:11 (NIV)

Meaning
-------

This verse serves as a pivotal reminder of the grace that underpins our relationship with God. Paul, the writer of Galatians, emphasizes that the law was never meant to be our savior. Instead, it highlights our need for a Savior. Righteousness—being right with God—is found in faith, not in meticulous adherence to rules.

To live by faith is to place complete trust in God’s promises, allowing Him to guide our path. It’s a movement from self-dependency to God-reliance, which is empowering. Through faith, we are justified, meaning God sees us as righteous because of Jesus’ sacrifice, not by our works. This liberating truth allows us to step out of the performance trap and into a vibrant relationship with Christ.

Here, Paul echoes the sentiment found in Habakkuk 2:4, reaffirming that righteousness through faith is not a new concept; it’s a fulfillment of God’s original plan. This foundational truth invites us to experience life’s fullness—living in freedom, peace, and joy.

Galatians 3:11 invites us to experience the depth and power of genuine faith. Imagine the freedom that comes with relinquishing the constant drive to meet every standard on our strength and instead gripping onto the faithfulness of God, who loves us unconditionally.

Actions to Take
---------------

– Reflect on areas where you are relying on your strength rather than trusting God, and take steps to release control to Him.

– Commit to daily moments of gratitude, recognizing God’s faithfulness in your life, both big and small.

– Study other scripture passages that focus on faith to deepen your understanding of this foundational aspect of your relationship with God.

– Engage with a faith community, whether online or in person, to encourage each other in living out your faith daily.

– Start a “Faith Journal” to document instances where you have seen God at work, reinforcing your trust in His plan.

Journal Prompts
---------------

– What are specific areas in my life where I can practice living by faith more intentionally?

– Reflect on a time when I relied on faith and saw God’s hand. How did it impact me?

– What fears or worries am I holding onto that I can give over to God?

– How do I define righteousness in my life, and how might this verse change that perspective?

– How can I encourage others to also live by faith and not by sight?

Prayer
------

Heavenly Father, thank You for the gift of faith and the righteousness we receive through it. Help me to trust in Your promises rather than leaning on my endeavors. Teach me to walk by faith daily, that I may live freely in Your love. Open my eyes to see Your work in my life and grant me courage to follow Your lead. Amen.

Q&amp;A about Galatians 3:11
----------------------------

Certainly! Galatians 3:11 is a verse from the New Testament of the Bible. Here is a Q&amp;A based on this verse:

**Q: What is the main message of Galatians 3:11?**

A: Galatians 3:11 emphasizes that justification cannot be achieved through adherence to the law alone, but rather through faith. It underscores the principle that righteousness comes not from legalistic practices but from faith in God.

**Q: How does Galatians 3:11 fit into the overall message of the Book of Galatians?**

A: The Book of Galatians is focused on the concept of freedom in Christ and challenges the notion that Christians must follow Jewish laws to achieve salvation. Galatians 3:11 highlights a central theme of the epistle: that faith in Jesus Christ is sufficient for justification and salvation, and reliance on the law is not necessary.

**Q: What does Galatians 3:11 say about the law?**

A: Galatians 3:11 states that “no one is justified before God by the law,” indicating that the law, on its own, is insufficient for achieving righteousness. Instead, faith is the essential element for being justified in the eyes of God.

**Q: What Old Testament scripture does Galatians 3:11 reference?**

A: Galatians 3:11 references Habakkuk 2:4, which says, “The righteous will live by faith.” This connection shows the consistency of faith as a means to righteousness throughout both the Old and New Testaments.

**Q: How does this verse relate to the teachings of Paul elsewhere in the New Testament?**

A: Paul frequently teaches that righteousness comes from faith and not from works of the law, a key tenet of his theology. This is also found in his letters to the Romans and the Ephesians, where he emphasizes grace and faith over legalistic practices.

These questions and answers aim to shed light on the theological significance of Galatians 3:11 and its role in the broader context of Pauline theology.

Additionally you can put an intention just before the session starts. As I live in Istanbul, we ll arrange a suitable time for both of us!

A well-structured morning routine can improve focus, increase productivity, and enhance mental clarity. Whether you're looking to kickstart your day with purpose or create a foundation for long-term success, having a clear morning routine list can make all the difference. In this blog, we will explore how to create an effective routine that aligns with your lifestyle, helps you manage your time efficiently, and promotes physical and mental well-being.

# Why a Morning Routine Matters

Your morning routine isn't just a series of tasks to check off; it's the foundation for how you approach the day. Many successful people attribute their achievements to sticking to a structured routine, allowing them to stay grounded and proactive. A thoughtful [morning routine list](https://healthiermetoday.com/morning-routine/) helps eliminate decision fatigue by establishing a set of habits that automate the start of your day. With a consistent routine, you can minimize stress, improve your mood, and give yourself the best possible chance of success—day after day.

# Creating Your Ideal Morning Routine List

When creating a morning routine, it’s essential to align the steps with your individual needs and goals. Below, we break down some key elements to consider when creating a morning routine that works best for you.

# 1. Wake Up at the Same Time

Consistency is critical when setting your internal clock. Waking up at the same time every day regulates your circadian rhythm, which improves sleep quality and energy levels. Start by setting a time that gives you enough room to complete your **morning routine list** without rushing. Aim for at least 7–8 hours of sleep to ensure that you’re well-rested and ready to tackle the day.

# 2. Hydrate

Hydration is often overlooked in the rush of getting out of bed, but it's one of the most important things you can do for your body in the morning. After hours of sleep, your body needs water to rehydrate, jumpstart your metabolism, and flush out toxins. Drinking a glass of water should be one of the first tasks on your **morning routine list**. You can also add lemon for an extra boost of vitamin C and flavor.

# 3. Mindful Movement or Stretching

Physical activity, no matter how light, helps wake up your body and mind. Whether you enjoy a brisk walk, yoga, or a quick at-home workout, incorporating movement into your morning routine increases endorphins, which boost your mood and reduce stress. Stretching can also help with flexibility and ease any tension built up overnight. A 10-15 minute session of mindful movement should be included in your **morning routine list** to get your blood flowing.

# 4. Practice Mindfulness or Meditation

Starting the day with a clear mind sets the stage for focus and calmness throughout the day. Mindfulness practices such as meditation, deep breathing, or even journaling can help center your thoughts, reduce anxiety, and bring more awareness into your daily activities. Even just five minutes of meditation can have a profound effect on your mental clarity, making it an essential addition to your **morning routine list**.

# 5. Have a Nutritious Breakfast

Your body needs fuel to operate effectively. Skipping breakfast can lead to a lack of focus and low energy levels later in the day. A balanced breakfast that includes protein, healthy fats, and fiber will keep you full and energized until your next meal. Items like eggs, oatmeal, or smoothies are great options to add to your **morning routine list** for a healthy start.

# 6. Set Daily Intentions or Goals

To make the most of your day, take a few minutes to outline your priorities and set your intentions. Whether it’s reviewing your to-do list, visualizing how you want your day to unfold, or writing down your goals, this step ensures you're focused and productive. A clear list of intentions helps you stay on track and align your actions with your bigger life goals, making it an essential component of your **morning routine list**.

# 7. Avoid Distractions

One of the biggest time wasters in the morning is mindlessly scrolling through your phone or watching TV. To keep your morning routine efficient and effective, avoid these distractions until you've completed your key tasks. Put your phone on Do Not Disturb mode or leave it in another room until you’ve gone through your **morning routine list**. This will help you stay focused and present.

# 8. Plan the Night Before

While this isn’t technically a morning task, planning ahead the night before can help streamline your morning routine. Laying out your clothes, prepping breakfast, and organizing your work materials the night before can significantly reduce stress in the morning. Including an evening routine in your overall daily strategy will ensure that your **morning routine list** runs smoothly without unnecessary interruptions.

# Customizing Your Morning Routine List

Everyone’s morning routine will look different, depending on personal preferences, work schedules, and lifestyle. Some may prioritize a long workout, while others might prefer a quiet reading session with a cup of tea. The key is to personalize your **morning routine list** in a way that resonates with your goals and sets you up for success.

Here are a few extra tips to customize your routine:

* **Work from Home**: If you work from home, your routine might include tasks like checking emails, setting up your workspace, or even taking a quick outdoor walk to simulate a ""commute.""
* **Busy Parents**: If you have kids, consider waking up before they do to have some quiet time for yourself. Use this time to meditate, enjoy a peaceful cup of coffee, or prepare the day’s meals.
* **Career-Oriented Individuals**: If your job requires a lot of mental energy, prioritize activities like reading, journaling, or goal setting to start the day with a clear head.

# Benefits of a Consistent Morning Routine

Incorporating a structured **morning routine list** can have far-reaching benefits, including:

* **Increased productivity**: A routine helps you stay organized and focused, which boosts productivity.
* **Better mental health**: Mindfulness and meditation improve mental clarity and reduce stress.
* **Physical health**: Incorporating movement and hydration early in the day improves physical health.
* **Improved time management**: A well-planned morning eliminates the need to make decisions in a rush, saving you valuable time.

# Final Thoughts

A well-crafted **morning routine list** is more than just a way to get things done—it's a tool for shaping your mindset, managing your energy, and achieving your goals. By starting your day with intention and purpose, you can improve your overall well-being and productivity. Whether you're an early riser or someone trying to build new habits, the key is to be consistent and find a routine that works for you.",1,1729008121.0,u_Healthiermetoday07,0,1.0,False

It's always super quiet and most days there aren't any dogs so it's the perfect place for a good sniff walk and for me to get coffee lol! I remember the days when I couldn't couldn't dream of taking my dog to downtown because he was so anxious and reactive. Now he just loose leash walks and enjoys his time 🥰

Now the weather is cooling down we can go for walks a little later in the morning so the coffee shops have quieted down a bit and the stores are open. Downtown near us is only small but very dog friendly and since we are walking later we have gotten to meet some of the shop owners and they are so sweet to my dog. He is muzzled but not once have they ever treated him like he's anything less but a good boy! His favorite shop owner always give him a treat and a good fuss and today he got to see her and I just love seeing someone so happy to see my dog and him so happy to see her 🥹

When I chose to muzzle my dog a small part of me was worried people would judge my dog and not want to interact with him anymore because of the muzzle. He loves people and he wouldn't understand if people avoided him but at the end of the day it was the least of my concerns and I just wanted my dog to be safe but honestly I've have had nothing but good experiences and it's been such an amazing opportunity to educate people on muzzles and the different reasons why dogs wear them! I got the pleasure of educating this sweet lady and she then went and told her daughter and family members about the positivity of muzzles and how they can stop dogs scavenging and she now tells her customers how sweet my dog is and why he's such a good boy and wears a muzzle 💚

Yesterday on our local Facebook group a lady posted that her 2 dogs had been attacked in down town and that the owner of the dog had refused to take responsibility and then was verbally abusive towards the owners of the dogs that got attacked. The shop owner had seen this and as soon as she saw me she told me her first thought was if her sweet friend (my dog) was the one who had been attacked and was hoping he was safe and unharmed 😭 she then told me she wish this lady was educated on muzzles and more responsible like me and that she hopes we stay safe and never meet this lady.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

I don’t think call center is for me nung nag apply ako as telemarketer, one whole week of training is dreadful to me. That’s when I realized ayoko pala talaga ng calls. I didn’t proceed na after the training. Ayoko ipilit ang sarili ko on something na mas high paying than the job I got na di ko naman maeenjoy especially I have a plan to finish college naman.

I'm a 28m (he/him) motion designer looking for someone to live with in Greenpoint, Bushwick, or E. Williamsburg. Until recently I was living in a studio in Greenpoint but it became too expensive, so I'm in a month-to-month situation in Bed Stuy right now.

Candidly I make pretty good money but my credit has gone down over this past year while I tried to live above my means, so if we were to sign a lease I might have to do a guarantor situation to mitigate that issue but TBD. Also in the case of signing a lease, I'd love to avoid a broker fee because I think those are so lame on principle, but we can cross that bridge later.

  
About me:

I grew up in northern Westchester and have lived in NYC for the past 10 years. I'm an extroverted, talkative guy who spends a lot of time out of the house hanging with friends or pursuing random hobbies, and otherwise might be at home playing games on my PC or drawing in my sketchbook.

I work for a big company doing motion design and am in the office 2 days a week usually, otherwise WFH. I like to cook/meal-prep when possible. I like to keep things pretty neat and clean, but I'm not going to be annoying and passive aggressive if you're not always 100% super tidy.

I play in a band for fun so I might play guitar at a low volume in my room, and also I listen to music frequently but will communicate with ya to make sure it's at a reasonable volume. I like to have friends over from time to time but am not really into hosting big groups except on rare occasions.

  
You:

Honestly, just be a communicative chiller. If you're cool with the description I gave of myself up there \^ then I'm sure I'll be cool with you. If things seem like they might be a good match we can chat and set up some time to meet for a drink or coffee and go from there.



Please hit me up if you think you might be a good fit! We can chat more from there.

I'll be travelling to Japan in late nov-early dec with my 1 year old and seeing that he's unable to vocalise his discomfort / feeling cold at this stage, we're wondering which cities in Japan will be of a comfortable temperature or weather (i.e. 15 deg thereabouts or slightly warmer without windy conditions) for us to travel to? for context, we live near the equator, so we're used to high 30 deg weather. 

we'd want to do something relaxing, like go on hunts for coffee/food, do a bit of shopping, eat a little bit of seafood, dip in onsens and hopefully visit some attractions.

I get full quickly, and I tend to stay full for a long time. On the other hand, my friend is quite the eater. She isn’t a voracious or ravenous eater, but she snacks quite a bit and often eats more meals than me. I think that’s perfectly fine, but I start to want to draw a line when she gets upset that I don’t join her when she’s eating.

For example, let’s say that it’s a Saturday and we’re out in the city to hang out for the day. We hang around a bit, maybe visit a few stores, but then we both get hungry, so we decide to eat lunch at a restaurant (our first time eating for the day). After the meal, we’re both full, but, after walking around for a bit more, my friend wants to snack on something, like a donut or boba. I’m still full, so I decide to just go into stores with her but not buy anything to eat/drink. And then she says that she wants to eat another meal, so I join her at a small restaurant or something, but I either don’t order or I order a very tiny thing, like coffee or tea, because it’s bad manners to go into a restaurant and not at least order something. She orders a full meal and now she is full again. But, later on, she either wants to snack again or eat another meal, say, at night. I’m still full from lunch, so I pass again but will join her without eating or keeping eating to a minimum. At some point, she gets upset at me because I won’t full-join her for snacks or meals. That it’s “boring” if she’s always the one eating without anyone to “join” her when she’s eating. I apologize, as usual, and make it clear again that I wasn’t hungry.

Am I in the wrong for not fully joining her for meals? Should I be forcing myself to dine with her, even when I don’t feel like eating? Am I being rude to my friend for not making proper orders along with her whenever she’s snacking or eating a meal at a restaurant? Is it alright that I would rather just sit there instead of eating?",0,1729005573.0,SeriousConversation,6,0.4,False

I ask because, outside the fire service, one of my hobbies is making YouTube comedic short videos, of military nature for the most part, but there's something that I've begun considering.

Ever since I discovered the channels Fire Dept Chronicles and Fire Dept Coffee and seeing how they're teaching civilians about Fire awareness, I've thought about doing something similar from time to time.

My intention is to make short videos where I will raise awareness and educate people about Fire safety through comedy, just like those channels, but airport related mostly.

Since I was accepted at the aviation club of my town, I just came up with this idea to make one or two videos of such nature so I can help raise awareness and teach a few things about airport fire safety.

While comedy and satire are good, it's also good from time to time to also educate and teach people about fire safety in a rather serious manner.

But I'm in a dilemma. I worry for many things. One, they may not take it seriously if I use comedy. Two, very few might watch them if I make them 100 percent serious. 

And on a personal level, I don't want to be considered a Jolly Volly, an Attention Vampire, a whacker, etc.

I just want to combine my experience from the service to raise awareness like Fire Dept Chronicles and Coffee do, but I understand there's a limitation to all that.

So I ask you all, should I at least try it? I don't want to give the wrong idea. 

And no, I don't plan to do this all the time. Just a few times for educational purposes. Not like the rest of my videos where they are satirical for the most part.

Because I want to take my job seriously and I want people to also take fire safety seriously.

So my question remains. Is it a good idea to at least try it? If not, what are the alternatives?",2,1729005542.0,Firefighting,0,1.0,False

I told her that it's no problem and that we can meet up whenever it's fine for us both. She responded that she won't be able to meet up the next week either because she has some matters to deal with. And I get that so I backed off to not get pushy about it.

Time has gone by and she hasn't attempted to hint at anything meeting up related which is making me feel a bit like I'm being led on or maybe I'm just overthinking it. I haven't asked her about meeting up after because I assume she'll ask me whenever she has time to meet, and I don't wanna get pushy about it because I know it's annoying. We have been texting each other every single day like I said, but it's starting to feel like this is just dragging on without anything really happening. And I totally get it if she wants to take things slow but I don't really know if this is even going anywhere or if I'm just someone to talk to. How do I know if I'm being led on? Would she be talking with me daily if that was the case? I'm gonna keep being in contact with her because I like talking to her but I'd love to have some progress too.",1,1729005471.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

It doesn’t matter how many carbs or what I put in the coffee, it ALWAYS goes super high. 
Today I got a medium vanilla cream cold brew at Dunkin. I checked their nutrition facts. There are only 2 carbs in it and then I also added a Splenda to it.  
I took like 25 units for the coffee plus a wrap (33 carbs) like an hour ago. I’ve had half the coffee and now my sugar is like 180 double arrow up. 
I rarely drink coffee, probably like once or twice a month, but I had a free coffee in rewards and was too tired to function this morning, so I was just wanting one.

She blamed us. She blamed the chair she broke during a silent destructive tantrum, when she got a standard pre-made template email of ""this position has been filled but thank you for applying anyways"" from a potential job opportunity. She destroyed her own belongings, not ours, which shows...weirdly aimed impulse control during a destroy-things temper tantrum? At 26? In someone else's home? You control all of that but stand on a cheap golding chair instead of a step stool you've used 3x because I told you not to use a chair? I'm so confused. 

We set the boundaries, the rules, the expectations. Bring your own groceries or order them to be delivered when you're here, not at work. Give us 24hrs notice before asking to come over. One or two nights on our couch is fine. Boyfriend? Not for awhile, you go see him, personally it's ***I*** who does not want him stealing our couch, our Xbox and TV and logins, our food we pay for we haven't even eaten yet, it is ***I*** who doesn't want him using Our soap and shampoo, our hot water, our laundry detergent. 

Her boyfriend is Jobless, likely will live off of SSDI forever due to being stuck in a conservatorship, doesn't know how grocery shop or budget, buys and eats only processed foods that will always be bought for him by his Human Owners, can't budget money between Uber and fast food and Starbucks (claimed they wanted to go out to get coffee, led us to question how they could afford uber then starbucks and uber again, she doesnt even like coffee, then they came back when we got out of the shower and they said, ""actually we went up to the gas station mini mart). They couldn't even keep their story straight, determine how much or little money they had, know or plan where they wanted to go, kept on refusing to take the public bus anywhere unless they tagged along with me to the grocery store, even then they complained it took too long and wanted uber (two buses and short walk to Walmart was 22minutes, about 40min back because diff bus times, they still wanted uber, I told them they're broke and I'm broke so use your bus pass, duh). 

And then he ate my new bag of chicken nuggets the next day, they used two portable appliances and didn't clean them to make ""quesadillas"", but could've done that in the microwave, just like they cooked 13 eggs in the microwave the previous night while ignoring my husband who said ""that's not safe, it could set the microwave too hot and cause it to short out, they could explode in there,  please use a frying pan"". Hours later I found the majority of messy egg mess in our trash can. They used up our eggs and chicken nuggets ***I*** bought at the grocery store, wasted our food twice over, didn't clean up kitchen items, left everything a hot mess. Couldn't even cook correctly. 

breaking his girlfriends bank account every time they're together and then she asks everyone else for $$$ via cash app bc she can't budget either. 

I'm still her friend. But I won't allow her to repeat history under my husband and mine's roof. It's not cool, not right, not acceptable. I can't allow disorder and chaos to happen again. I told her if she wants free will of her own to move out, we will help her thru the apartment hunting process. Her boyfriend isn't capable of helping her, or himself. We will help her learn to budget and balance life priorities --pay rent, utilities, wifi, credit cards (her toxic family has paranoid scared her into thinking that being one day late or -$10 overdue will get her bad credit score, bankruptcy and blacklisted from apartment applications for 7 years), all in that order. I've been guiding her thru the ideas of GrayRocking, social distancing, emotional disassociation from her family members. Obviously I'm not a therapist. She says she sees one on Telehealth every week, I suggested to her to address Gray Rocking with her therapist. Idk if she has. I won't ask. But I put it out there. 

Finally, my husband is annoyed with my rules and standards, but it stressed us out, too many people and no room for ourselves caused our cat to vomit twice (and they didn't tell me until 3hrs later, I was hiding in my bedroom all day while they played video games and mooched), caused me to stress out so badly, I left that day, they asked where I was going, i said ""far away from the both of you"". That was hard, but I had to. My bestie is still somewhat pissed. My husband is pissed. Too dang bad for them. I'm not letting her boyfriend in my door again. They can get a motel room or she can go to his place on her off-days, that was my logical suggestion. Don't bring your burdens upon my stress levels. I can't do that ever again.

 I'm still pissed. I want to let it go. But it's hard. I feel used. Burned. Taken advantage of. My peace was stolen for 5 days. My tolerance for bullshit robbed. I want it back.",1,1729005207.0,roommates,0,0.67,False

But anyway, she doesn’t incorporate much protein or greens or anything truly beneficial for her body and coupled with working out too much I think she’s causing herself over exertion and it’s making her look more swollen. She’s skinny and fit don’t get me wrong but I think she thinks she’s not thin enough so she in turn works out that much more but then it’s causing her to appear bigger because she’s not giving her body proper time to rest.

When I pulled up to Starbucks, I realized I never actually confirmed and sent the order, but there was no line in the drive-through so I just pulled through and placed my order.

SFX: Ding dong

**Hey there! Are you the new resident?**

**...**

(excited squeal) **Aahh! Welcome to the neighborhood! I’m Jules, dear, your neighbor two doors down to the west.**

**...**

**Yes, that’s right! Blue cottage with the herb garden in my front yard.** 

**...**

**Oh, you’re too sweet! Thank you very much; my humble little garden isn’t much, but it is my pride and joy. If you ever need anything, you let me know!** (suddenly dead serious) **Never go taking things without permission. Not a fruit, not a flower, not a leaf off the tree. Not everything in my garden is as it appears - I do so hate to see the unwary suffer the consequences of their own ignorance.**

**...**

(flipping back to cheery) **Great! I can tell we’re going to get on swimmingly. I must tell you, you’ve picked the absolute best time of year to move in.**

**...**

**Fall, yes, but I’m talking particularly about Halloween! Oh, we adore Halloween on this street. People go all out.** 

**...**

**You love it too? Oh, honey, you’re gonna fit right in!** 

**...**

**Oh my dear, don’t stress yourself about getting yours decorated! We’ve all been here for years and have had plenty of time to build up our decor. Decorations are fully voluntary and only if you enjoy it. There’s no HOA,** (under speaker’s breath)  **Nobody here is that evil.**

**...**

**Hmm? Oh, nothing. Ah, silly me! I almost forgot what I came over here for in the first place. I’d forget my own head if it wasn’t duct taped on. Speaking of my garden, I’ve brought you a little welcome basket of goodies!** 

**Let’s see. Mm, a few fresh apples. This is a little mini loaf of zucchini bread, a pomegranate straight from the tree, some of my blackberry preserves, zucchini mini-muffins, a couple sachets of dried lavender and rose petal for your drawers. Zucchini chips, they’re actually very good. Tomato sauce with only a little grated zucchini. And this, this my home-pressed cider. Not to brag, but this you might say is what I’m best known for around here. People find my cider positively enchanting. Here, smell this.** 

SFX: clink of glass bottle, pop or twist of the cap. 

**Intoxicating, no? Who needs pumpkin spiced whatever with flavoring out of a plastic bag from some bougie-ass cafe with burnt coffee when you can be drinking this. A sip of this and you'll be hooked! Here, I’ve brought you two bottles. Be sure to save one for midnight on All Hallows Eve. Drink it up: I promise, it’ll change your life.**

**...**

**No. There’s no zucchini in the cider. I swear it.**

**...**

**Oh, you’re so very welcome dear! It’s very kind of you to offer, but alas I’ll have to take a rain check on that tea. It’s the harvest season; lots of pies to bake, lots of cauldrons to stir. You just pop by any time you need anything, dear, any help with your yard, any local recommendations, any advice on strange and worrying noises or objects you might see around. I'd just ignore it, I'm sure it's nothing. Ta ta for now!**

**Hey there buddy I heard there was a new neighbor who moved into the old Grovenor place and that’s you, it’s you, how super awesome and amazing to have a new friend welcome!**

**...**

**Hey its a real pleasure to meet you too buddy hey do you like to run?**

**...**

**Yeah, running! See, I’m Remy I live right over there on the corner past the maple tree, pine, pine, maple, liquidamber but you may have seen me running around. I’m the founder and leader of our local cross country and trail running association and if you’re looking for some great exercise and fresh air there’s just nothing better in the whole wide world than getting out there into nature with the rest of the pack. Here have a flyer.** 

**...**

**Yeah I know this is just my name and number on a piece of paper I know, I’m sorry, I kinda ran out of flyers last year, keep meaning to get around to printing up some more but really nobody runs anything off paper anymore so what’s the point? You can just text me and I’ll let you know when and where and we can add you to the group text and get you set up with the carpool and share the discord server where you can check out the annotated map files - there are quote unquote official maps that the local county parks and rec department puts out but honestly they’re so out of date and don’t include some of the best spots just because they might not technically be quote unquote public land and some uptight losers like to complain about quote unquote trespassing and quote unquote property damage and quote unquote vanishing livestock, so we all kinda pool our collective wisdom here. But if that sounds like too much reading - it is! There’s absolutely no prerequisites, just get out there and run with us! You’ll pick it up in no time!**

**...**

**Yeah yeah yeah yeah the biggest groups are on the weekends, but I’m out there every day! There’s no feeling like it, the wind in your hair, the strength in your legs, your pack at your side, the prey crackling through the underbrush, leaving scent trails left and right up and down... Sorry, kinda got distracted there. So can we count you in!?**

**...**

**Hey that’s no problem we are super beginner friendly, everybody’s gotta start somewhere only like a third of us were born to this the rest picked it up real real quick. It’s super amazeballs what you can do when you let go and connect with nature - our bodies are capable of incredible things when we ask them to stretch for us into the shapes we envision for ourselves, the shapes we dream about night after night after night...**

**...**

(disappointed) **You sure? You really sure? If you feel like giving it a chance, we’re doing a fun run on Halloween night, after the kiddies are in bed and the rest of us come out to play. Don’t worry, there’ll be plenty of light - gonna be a full moon.**

**...**

**Hey no need to apologize and no worries at all! You’re probs exhausted from all the moving and the last thing you want to do right now is make some major physical changes. Keep my number and let me know if you ever change your mind. Or hey! If you’re looking for something else physical I also run the local pickleball tournament, the basketball beer league, ooh ooh ooh and ultimate frisbee! I love ultimate frisbee I bet you would to if you gave it chance there’s just nothing like chasing that little red piece of plastic down a great big field, oh, it makes me salivate just to think about it -**

**...**

**Such a delight to make your acquaintance, I assure you the pleasure is all mine.** 

**I must beg your forgiveness for not coming by sooner to properly introduce myself; I have a somewhat unusual sleeping cycle. I hope you’ll accept this little token as welcome and apology both. Do you care for wine? This is a saucy little Cabernet Franc from my cellar. My guests have always fallen hard for this one. I also took the liberty of bringing over** (SFX: wine glasses chime) **two glasses.** 

**...**

**Oh, I can see you’re dressed for bed. So terribly sorry for any inconvenience and all, but I’ll admit I am hoping I might tempt you into inviting me inside? If you aren’t terribly busy, I could really go for something deep and red. And after all, you do seem fond of working late?**

**...**

**I saw your light on, of course! I see those lights on so late, so many nights, ever since you moved in. See, that’s my house. Right across the street there, in the restored Victorian. I have an excellent view through the stained glass, right into your bedroom...**

**...**

(startled, but pleased) **Oh! Why, thank you. Yes, I am quite pleased with the work my architect did. This whole street is full of historical buildings but nobody but me seems to appreciate that. It’s rather brilliant, isn’t it? The delicate balance of the timeless and the modern. Tell me, how do you feel about the meeting of mortal and immortal...?**

**...**

(suddenly cross) **It’s not black, it’s dark gray.** (clears throat) **Sorry. Didn’t mean to snap, just... a lot of people make that mistake. It’s not black. It’s Somber Summer Shadow with stonework in various shades of Charcoal, with pops of Burnt Peppercorns and Smokey Dove. All of which are shades of gray.**

**...**

(completely missing the joke) **Fifty...? No, I don’t see why there would be fifty shades. It’s just the three primary paint colors, unless you count all the various colors in the stonework. Let’s see, I count one, two, three, four... five, six... seven - hmm, no. Maybe? Yes, let’s count it as seven. Eight. Nine...**

**...**

**Hmm? Oh, sorry! No, can’t come in right now. Here, take these. Ten, definitely eleven. Yes yes, welcome human - uh. Fellow... human of the world to our street.** (frustrated)  **Ugh, I’ll deal with you later!**

**...**

**No, that wasn’t a joke...? Oh. You mean because I’m a skeleton you think I’m making puns about the human skeletal system? Well, I’m not! I don’t find anything humerus about this situation.**

**...**

**The humerus bone what? Ugh! I don’t care. Listen, pal. I ain’t here to do no neighborhood greeting. I’m sure the local welcome wagon has already been out in force. You seen Remy yet? Aubrey? Jules? Lazarus?**

**...**

**All but Lazarus huh? Heh. Don’t you worry, {he/she/they}’ll turn up. But I ain’t here to make nice. I’m here to lay out some boundaries, pal. Good fences make good neighbors, and establishing up front expectations means we don’t get under each others skin.**

**...**

**Am I doing what on purpose?**

**...**

**All right, whatever. Yeah, pleased to meet to you. I’m Chip, from the house to the left, hello, hi hope we can get some mutual and reasonable expectations in place. First things first - you got a dog?**

**...**

**Oh, you heard me. Now I ain’t gonna try to tell you your business in the privacy of your own home etcetera etcetera, but if you got a dog, rule number one is you gotta keep that thing leashed when you leave the property! Lookee here! Two tenants back, lady had a damn Rat Terrier she let run around the neighborhood. “Oh everyone loooves Pookie! Oh, Pookie wouldn’t hurt a soooooul!” Well I guess Pookie had either some ideas about the ensouled state of the legally undead or that lady was full of shit because look at what Pookie did to my left fibula!**

**...**

**Damn right it’s terrible. I ain’t got no marrow, that ain’t growing back. Everytime I hang out with the guys, now, I’m in for a ribbing!**

**...**

(slightly mollified) **Huh. Well, I'm gonna hold you to that. Next thing we gotta talk about - fixing that hedge between our yards. You heard of bone meal?**

**...**

**Bone meal! Best thing for feeding those micronutrients back into their roots. You gotta take care of those boxwoods now before the ground freezes, or they ain’t gonna survive until spring and then I gotta look at a bunch of scraggly ass plants for years while you try to grow something new back.**

**...**

**Okay. Fine then. Thanks, I guess. For doing the absolute minimum a good neighbor should do. Which is more than some people have the spine to do, so I do appreciate it. I’ll be on my way.** 

**...**

**Eh?**

**...**

**...**

**Heh, heh, heh. Yeah, I’d say there’s some weird stuff going on in this neighborhood too, to say the least. You got some real bad timing, moving onto this street, on the week of Halloween. That’s like throwing red meat down in front of the dogs - or at least a bone in front of a damn Rat Terrier. Not to speak evil over the innocent, but you are boned! Ah, heh heh heh. Ah heh heh heh!**

Anyway, I wanted to create this short ""Welcome"" post as the subreddit (hopefully) continues to get built out. I'm still not sure how I want to manage things/provide picks and data analysis, but I figured having a subreddit is a good start. More to come.

For any new faces, I'll copy/paste something I wrote nearly one year ago to give you a brief introduction (feel free to browse through my [Reddit history](https://old.reddit.com/user/literatelemurs/) too):


---

> **Which sports do you bet on?**

Mainly NFL, NHL, NBA, and MLB since I have had the most success with them recently. Other than that, I will occasionally bet on UFC, Boxing, and Soccer.

> **Where do you get your picks from?**

Data! Lol but seriously, I have spent years configuring sports betting predictive models and fell flat on my face quite a bit. But I've finally compiled enough historical data, and after semi-automating a lot of the process, I have a pretty solid tool that compares its predictions against various other data models. Then I spend a lot of time sifting through everything to see if there are any major discrepancies in its predictions vs. the official (or alt) lines. And, voila!

> **Why do you think X is a good pick?**

If you can't already tell, I'm a sucker for data and would love to share why my reasonings for any of my picks. Sometimes I get too in the weeds and spend hours going through the data to make an argument for my case - as you can see in some of my previous posts on Reddit. But I enjoy it. So if I have the time, again, I'll be more than glad to provide the rationale behind my madness.

> **What is your winning percentage?**

If we're only going to look at the picks I've posted on Reddit, here is where I currently stand:

* NBA: 17-1 (94.44%)

* NHL: 69-38 (64.49%)

* NFL: 68-59 (53.54%)

* MLB: 27-28 (49.09%)

*(Last updated on November 1, 2023 - I am going to reset these numbers once I officially kick off this subreddit and track things more efficiently. Stay tuned for more details.)*

Outside of my ""Reddit picks"", I'll just say that I've been above 55% in all four sports over the past year. But I don't put much stock in winning percentage anyway, because I've seen people with a <45% win rate that profit more than most due to measured risk and strategy. With that said, and without bragging too much about numbers, I'm fairly profitable overall, with my highest ROI being in the NFL and NHL.

> **Can I tip you?**

Credit to /u/big_sosa_dad since he was the first person to ever ask this lol although I felt uncomfortable at first and would never ask or expect anything, you are [**always welcome to tip here**](https://tiptopjar.com/literatelemurs), or you could even just [**buy me a coffee**.](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/literatelemurs) Any and all support helps a ton and allows me to continue to dedicate time towards providing my analysis to ya'll.

I think that covers most of it. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to talk shop. I'm a pretty chill dude and am always down to chat about this stuff. I also get genuine pleasure out of helping people beat these damned sportsbook overlords and their juiced odds, so let me know if any of my picks helped you hit a nasty 10-legged parlay or something absurd.

I wanted only to be in nature and be with my friends and have my hobbies and do my part to contribute to society but I had no ambition w/r/t money, looks, professional titles and such.

this lack of ambition really held me back for a long time. I think I was born for a small community somewhere that people prioritize the collective over their individual selves. i don't have that competitive and acquisitive (?) drive.

sometimes I still feel that part of me before i drink my coffee. sorry bout the novel i guess i haven't really thought about this mechaniism before so this is me tryna explain it to myself too

1g49uzs,https://i.redd.it/jroh84bnqxud1.jpeg,O outro motivo de café especial parecer “chafé”. ,"Esses últimos dias houveram vários posts, discussões e memes sobre a concentração e cor do café.  Então pensei em trazer algumas informações que não vi serem discutidas.

A explicação mais comum é associar a aparência de “chafé” ao fato da torra dos cafés especiais terem um grau mais baixo em relação aos cafés tradicionais, o que lhes dão uma cor mais clara, avermelhada e acastanhada. 

Mas isso não explica exatamente por que os coados feitos de grãos especiais, além da cor mais clara, aparentam ter uma concentração menor de café — o vulgo café ralo. Como é o caso de muitas fotos postadas aqui e nas redes sociais de cafeterias e aficionados. Cafés clarinhos, límpidos e notavelmente translúcidos, nos lembrando dele… o chá. 

Se você tem essa impressão, você está com razão. Cafés especiais são geralmente preparados com MAIS água do que o costumamos usar em cafés tradicionais. Naturalmente, não existe uma única proporção usada entre os bebedores de café. Mas no Brasil, a proporção gira em torno de 1g de pó para cada 7 a 10g de água no coadinho tradicional. Podendo ser até mais concentrado. 

Já cafés especiais, são preparados começando por volta de 1:12 (1g de pó para 12g de água) até 1:18 — ou até mais diluído. Para referência, a SCA (Specialty Coffee Association) determina que seja usada uma proporção de 1:18 no protocolo de avaliação para pontuação do café.

# Mas tem o motivo para isso? Sim, existe um motivo técnico:

Cafés especiais são mais densos e duros, então é mais difícil extrair seus compostos solúveis. Usar mais solvente (água quente) é uma das formas de aumentar a extração desses compostos solúveis, que são os sabores que queremos beber. A consequência é uma bebida mais diluída, porém melhor extraída. 

Então, mesmo que você use a mesma proporção de café e água num café tradicional vs. um especial, a bebida do café tradicional será mais concentrada, pois a água terá mais facilidade em extrair os compostos nele. Claro, considerando que todos os outros parâmetros são os mesmos (moagem, temperatura, tempo de contato, agitação, etc.)

Esses são os dois fatores, cor da torra e concentração de sólidos dissolvidos, são os motivos que levam o café especial a ter esse aspecto mais de chá. ",17,1729004692.0,cafebrasil,13,0.84,False

I love a good pot of jasmine green tea, nothing fancy, just sunflower brand. But since I moved to a new country I’ve been looking for a comparable brand. 

I also like coffee, and turned my husband on to “good” coffee beans from a local shop, because grocery store coffee *isnt it*. Well, I finally ran out of my rationed tea and thought well surely this specialty coffee and tea shop will have okay tea.

Ladies, fellas, it’s flavored with jasmine extract or something, I don’t know, it tastes like I’m licking an old lady’s perfume bottle. I am so sad😞 I paid not an indecent amount on it and it’s completely undrinkable. Please come cry with me 🥲

My family was never very popular or social but we did have neighbors, friends, other family members , coworkers, people we know from church,  and people we just seen everyday in our community.    Now it seems i'm basically alone . I talk to my daughter everyday but she is married and has her own life, we rarely spend time together just to spend time together and mom of course is here physically but it's more like i'm taking care of a child, only with a child, you can pick them up and go out in public, etc and if they make a fuss, no one thinks anything of it, not like with a person with dementia whom you can't take out in public and as a result you can't go anywhere either.

When I moved  to this apartment 14 years ago,  I had my mom, stepdad and daughter in my life.  I had some good older neighbors and some that were my age. We didn't hang out together but sometimes talked and said hi when we say each other.  I had some good coworkers, my job hadn't became as crappy as it later did,  mom still had people she talked to from church and she went to activities.   I knew a lot of the employees at the mall as I had worked there in the past, as well as being on some online sites where we communicated every day. I was on some of the free sample sites where we talked about what we go in the mail that day, etc.    Even the people in the rental office were nice and sociable and we used to have activities here at Christmas, Valentines day, etc. 

Then one by one everyone seemed to disappear.  Stepdad died in 2010 , daughter married in 2017, mom's dementia started affecting me almost 2 years ago.    All my good neighbors are gone, the older ones have died or had to move and others just moved away through the years   Now I have nothing but 20-30 year old neighbors that won't as much as say hi when they see you.   The new management hides in the office, and we have no commnity activities anymore.   Mom hasn't been to church in years and the ones she went to church with are her age and older and don't make contact anymore.   I quit my job last year but the last few years I was working with strangers.  Everyone that I started with 16 years before had either retired, moved or died (we had like 6 people in their 40-s 50s die of cancer or heart attacks in the years I worked there). I found myself working with people that were in high school at the time had started working there and now they were bossing me around.   There were only 2 people that I talked to at work at the time I quit but they have just vanished too, I messaged them months ago to say hi and neighter even read my messages. 

Most of the employees I knew from the mall are gone now too,  only a couple I see that I have known for years as well as mom's senior group that we used to hang out with have mostly passed and only a few still come to the mall to have coffee and even though I go through around the time they would be there, I rarely see any of them.     

It just seems like everyone is gone, either dead, or left and i'm standing here alone.   I was thinking as I walked home today with our groceries,,    When I moved here, there were 4 of us walking home from the mall, then stepdad died, and there were 3 of us, then daughter married, then it was just my mom and I for over 6 years and now it's just me walking home alone as mom hasn't been to the mall since last year.",12,1729004614.0,CaregiverSupport,3,1.0,False

Takket være et oprydningstilbud, er turen nu kommet til en af de helt store klassikere, Illy.
Denne ikoniske kaffe, som sælges i deres kendte cylinderformede dåser, har delt vandene i kaffedebatten i årevis. Byder den på en klassisk mørkristet kaffesmag, eller den bare brændt?
Herudover har jeg, gennem cafébesøg rundt omkring i europa, selv smagt flere udgaver af denne kaffe, altid serveret i den kendte Illy espressokop.
Alle cafeers espresso, brygget på Illy bønner, har budt på en meget mørk drik, med mørk crema, og en bedsk smag, som altid har fået mig yil at undres: Kan café personale ikke finde ud af at lave espresso?

Det er blevet tid til at prøve klassikeren af herhjemme, og det første jeg oplever, så snart jeg har åbnet forseglingen på dåsen, er Illys ikoniske brændt kaffebønne lugt, som nonchalant trækker op af dåsen. Lugten er ikke udpræget ubehagelig og jeg holder dåsen tæt på min næse, for bedre at fornemme, hvad jeg skal til at smage på, og her kan jeg virkelig fornemme den intense lugt af daggammelt askebæger, jeg kan næsten ane de gamoe cigaretter som må være blevet slukket, i denne beholder 🚬
Uanfægtet lugten forsætter jeg mit foretagende.
Disse mørkristede bønner er en fornøjelse at indstille maskineriet på, det tager et enkelt forsøg, og så er min espresso og ristretto indstillet. Dette er så også den eneste fordel, som jeg oplevede med disse bønner.
Smagen i både espresso og ristretto, er så intens brændt, at jeg tænker tilbage på alle de kopper Illy, som jeg har drukket på cafeer, og jeg undres, hvordan kommer man frem til, at ville forsætte med at sælge så modbydeligt et produkt til kunder verden over?
Hvis jeg skal beskrive smagsnoterne, så må det være: askebæger og forkullede kaffebønner.

Min oplevelse er selvfølgelig subjektiv og kort beskrevet, men jeg kan ikke finde noget ved dette produkt, som kan få mig til at anbefale det til andre.

I wanted to talk about something I have realised some time ago. As very extroverted, it’s not an issue for me to be the one who reaches out and invites people for coffee, drinks, at home or whatever! I love having and making friends and I am very generous at going out and introducing them to my place.

However, as I grow older I have seen a pattern, that maybe it just happened or I nurtured it, I am not sure. It seems that, if I am for some reason stopping reading out to people, they just disappear. And when they reappear, they mention stuff like “we lost touch”, or “where have you been all this time”, indicating that I was the one disappearing. When I simply stopped initiating.

I used to have so many friends and acquaintances, and unfortunately, now I cannot say the same. Of course, I do have people in my life that are constant rocks, but there is an understanding that both parties need to show interest for the friendship to continue to exist. 

Lately I stopped hanging out with a friend that I know for many years now, once I realised that not only I was only the one reaching out and asking for us to hang out, but in cases where I invited that person at home, or at parties and birthdays, he never showed interest in bringing a gift or merely something to show that “hey, thank you for inviting me, here’s something for you”, sort of. 

I am feeling sad and disappointed, as I always make sure to think about others and try my best to include them. In situations like this I only feel that others do not think of me the same and that the feelings and overall friendship are not mutual. Of course, life happens and people can drift apart, and I have no issue maintaining a friendship if I understand that okay, things happened, you were/are busy, but you care to call me sometime and show active interest for my wellbeing.

What’s your opinion? Have you encountered that yourselves?

Horizon is that line joining sky and earth. The work in this exhibition invites viewers to consider their individuality and shared humanity, reflected in the beauty, strength, and healing of self, community, and our living sphere."" valeriehuhn.com

1g49bir,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1g49bir/upcoming_radar_qt_expansion/,"Upcoming RADAR, QT Expansion","Good Morning! Long time lurker, first time posting for advice here. 

I (34/f, sopo) am having a RADAR tomorrow with my partner (37/m, married) that’s going to be heavily focused on Quality Time and what that may look like going forward.

For context, I’ll be moving to being fully local in January. For the past 6 months, I’ve been a 45-minute drive away but I work in the city in which he lives. I make that commute 4x a week for work, so moving to the city on a part-time basis (Mon night through Thursday w/ alternate weekends), will allow me to still handle part-time caregiving for my mother and balance work/hobbies/relationships both platonic and romantic. 

Right now, we’ve established a pattern of two weekend dates a month (we try to make those overnights if he’s able to host for one and I pay for a hotel for the other or, like this month, we pay for two hotels). We also try and have a virtual game night or a coffee/lunch date each week. We’ve progressed to this over the last two months and it’s been meeting my baseline need/desire for QT! 

I’ve been open about wanting to offer more time availability for in-person when I move in January and he’s been receptive/has made comments about how he’s looking forward to it. In preparing for tomorrow, we sent each other our talking points. He’s looking to establish a standing game night and a standing coffee/lunch date (unsure if that’s going to be weekly or what the frequency is on that just yet) but he wants to know if currently my in-person frequency is being met. 

I am a person who likes to have potential solutions ready ahead of time. I gave a heads up that I would be bringing the future thinking of overnights/meetups to the table. I’m trying to keep my wants realistic and sustainable. 
While I know that I won’t have the answer unless I just ask him, which I fully intend to do, I’d like guidance on if what I’m asking for sounds reasonable or if there’s a better way to phrase it? I fully understand that what may not be too much for me, may be too much for him which is valid. 

Ideas:

1. keep our every other weekend schedule (usually a Fri-Sat or a Sat-Sun), a weekly virtual game night but the option for the coffee/lunch date to be a dinner date at my place on the weeks where we aren’t seeing each other on the weekend. Doesn’t have to be an overnight (even if I would like it to work towards having one overnight a week). 

2. Every other month take a long weekend once a month (Fri-Sunday) or 

3. Virtual game or coffee/lunch date once a week, keep our every other weekend dates but make one of those weekends a long one. 
 

Does this sound reasonable or is there a better way to phrase it? We’ve both put a lot of time, energy, and resources into this relationship so far. Ideally, these are things we can have an ongoing, open dialogue about as there’s still a couple months until I’m officially move-in to my place. As long as we’re working towards something! 

(and also I see the appeal of not continuing to risk an indecent exposure charge 😂)

For additional context, he doesn’t have children and we’re both working professionals with a range of hobbies/relationships. I have a strong support network of deep, platonic friends that I invest my time into and I balance career/hobbies/caregiving/dating. 

If you’ve made it this far, thank you!😊

I'm on 100mg SR twice a day (my pharmacy only has Solco brand). Been on it for a week, and no terrible side effects whatsoever. But I do have some questions. 

1) Does zyn (nicotine pouches) have any effect on it? Does it make it less effective? 

I pop at least two/three 6mg a day 



2) Caffeine, does it also make it less effective or not work (idk how to phrase it)?

 FYI I don't do coffee like ever (get sleepy and nasueous from it like my whole life, however I do Redbull, LOVE IT) I had one 8oz Redbull every other day since starting and so far no jitters, shacking, nausea etc etc. I know it can change BUTTTTT the Main question is does it slow down the pill in any way? 


3) What Brand Cough Drops is safe? 

You cannot mix some active ingredients in cough drops with bupropion, you can get bad bad reaction, what brand of cough drops is safe? We're going into that season switch from hot to cold and getting sick is very easy (eastern TN resident so we still have hot weather 80F and drops to 40F) 


4) Water or Electrolytes? 

Dry mouth is not fun, and I chug a lot of water to help (chewing gum helps too since you produce more saliva) but what's better water or electrolytes, I'm talking liquid IV to mix into water or Powerade etc? 


5) When you know to go up a dose?

 As mentioned I'm only a week in and been great so far (pretty sure it's honeymoon stage) but when will I know do go up or down?

Definitely need one that stands up. It’s basically his mobile filing cabinet without the files. 

He tosses large earphones, umbrella, and empty coffee mug in there too. Would love one with coffee mug slot and otherwise lots of space. Weight not an issue—strong guy, short walk into hospital. Doesn’t have to impress anyone with brand name etc—just needs to look professional enough.

1g48vq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1g48vq4/eletta_explore_first_espresso_bad/,Eletta Explore first espresso bad,"Hello all,

A few weeks now I own an Eletta Explore but I'm struggling a bit with it. To be specific, the first few espresso's after turning the machine on are always bad. They are so sour that even in a cappucino the sour taste cuts through the milk.

Pucks are non existent and crumbled in the waste bin. They are partially dry as well which explains the sour underextracted taste. Also after making the espresso the machine sounds like water is steaming internally. A lot of water goes in the red water collector below the dripping tray as well.

I've discovered that after making a few espresso's or even better a coffee the next espresso's are really good for a while. Evenly extracted and pucks are nicely formed. Taste is awesome as well. The steaming sound is also gone then. Unfortunately the espresso's get bad again when the machine has been off for a while.

Is there a solution for this or is anyone else having this issue? It seems like the machine doesn't properly heat up when being turned on but I don't know how to resolve this.

So far I've tried turning off energy saving, turning up the water heat, perform an extra rinse cycle and just tapping some hot water first but none of those things seem to help. Only thing that helps is brewing a coffee or a few espresso's first but it seems wastefull to having to throw a coffee away first before having a nice espresso.

  
Any help would be appreciated, thanks. ",2,1729002110.0,superautomatic,20,1.0,False

Noong college, palagi kaming magkasama sa coffee shops at sabay nag-aaral. May girlfriend siya noon, at nirerespeto ko ang relasyon nila dahil para ko na siyang
nakatatandang kapatid. Tuwing mag-aaral kami, sinasabihan ko siyang magpaalam sa girlfriend niya para hindi mag-isip ng masama. Sa totoo lang, wala akong gusto sa kanya at hindi ko siya balak gawing boyfriend.
Hindi naman siya gwapo pero ma-appeal at charming, kaya marami ang nagkakagusto sa kanya. Ramdam ko rin na kinakaibigan ako ng ibang estudyante dahil sa kanya.

Noong nag-master's kami, napansin kong naging mas attentive siya sa akin at parang jowa ang asta kahit sila pa rin ng girlfriend niya. Nag-confess siya na may gusto siya sa akin noong college. Napaka-clingy at sweet niya, kaya unti-unti akong lumayo dahil maraming nagsasabi na may relasyon kami, at bilang respeto na rin sa girlfriend niya. Sineselosan ako ng girlfriend niya, at inassure ko naman na wala akong balak sa boyfriend niya.

Ngayon, may family at business problem si boy na naging dahilan ng pagkabaon niya sa utang. May utang siya sa akin pero hindi ko siya sinisingil kasi alam kong hindi pa stable ang sitwasyon niya. Naaawa ako kasi baka wala na siyang makain o pera. Yan ang nararamdaman ko kasi napakabait niya sa lahat at hindi ko siya pinagkakaitan ng tulong. Hindi ko rin alam kung sila pa rin ng girlfriend niya kasi on and off ang status nila.

Hindi ko alam kung anong gagawin ko sa kanya dahil baka masama ang dating kay jowa.

One of the ""bigger"" little fights recently was over a phone charger. Over the years we have been together, she has continued to lose/misplace my phone chargers. I at least twice now have bought replacement phone chargers (one time even buying two, so she could ""have her own""), and everytime they end up getting lost. A few months ago, I went ahead and bought myself a nice, fast charging charger. I specifically made a point to say, ""okay serious, don't touch this charger, I am buying this for myself so I know where it is"". Then a couple months later, I go to use the charger and it's not there. I ask her about it, and she quickly goes like ""oh crap"" realizing she forgot to put it back, which made me think she's done this before. When I got upset, she basically brushed it off because ""it's just a charger"", trying to make it seem like I'm crazy for getting upset about a charger. But it wasn't just about that one charger that one time.



Then another this morning, she went to drop our son off at school which usually my mom does. She made a comment about getting to get Starbucks, and she has gotten it for me in the past, so I assumed she would be bringing me home Starbucks today. My bad for assuming. She comes home with no Starbucks for me, okay annoyed but I'll make coffee. I go to make coffee and she keeps trying to take over the process to make up for not bringing me Starbucks. I try to make it myself, but she is insistent that she makes it. I say okay, hand her the coffee pot and walk away. 15 minutes later I come down, coffee hasn't been started. No water in the tank, she is finishing a shower. I finish making the coffee that I tried to make in the first place, then go mention it to my wife. She just goes ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry""--she does this when she wants an issue to just be over with. If she makes a mistake, she apologizes and then in her mind it's over, she can't take it back right? So after she says she is sorry, I have to just let it go. Doesn't matter that it's part of a larger issue of lack of consideration.



A lot of it seem like little things, individually they mostly are. But they all add up. And then I don't even get the space to be upset about it, because ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"" She ends up making herself out to be the victim of--idk, me being upset? I'm not allowed to be upset about things, especially if she doesn't think it's a big deal. This is where most of me being upset goes, either I get over it without ever bringing it up, or I bring it up and she manages to get upset with me about it. And then when I talk stern at all, I'm ""yelling"", meanwhile she is the one who will actually yell and curse at me. 🙃",3,1729001920.0,Manipulation,2,1.0,False

Basically to put it mildly my partners Mother is the typical type of “Narcissistic” mothers who hate who there son is dating and will say/do whatever she can to prevent it/get them to break up.

She has done terrible things to me such as Make Fun/Terrible remarks about my Condition (I have PCOS) and she has called me a bloke before,commented on my facial hairs due to my condition and said to my partner”why would you chose someone like this if you want to have children” other things she has said are the usual comments about my weight,My hobbies,my job and about my family.

She and the rest of his family have never met mine and she instantly judged them for letting me be involved in a Hobby she did  not agree with and I was called along with my family “a bunch of p**dos” All my Hobby is , is being a furry which I don’t do much anymore due to this relentless torment I get from them. I use to make TikTok’s too but unfortunately my partners younger sister found my profile and began harassing it and making fun of it with his mother.

My partner also lives with *my* family due to her kicking him out because he was quote on quote too much for her and she also hated me so we gave him somewhere to live and she has never once been grateful to my parents for letting him stay here and knowing that he his safe. She has also commented on the housing situation aswell and claimed that my family were “heavy smokers” and that my partner should be careful as he has asthma even though my family do not smoke she made a judgment which her sister said the same aswell.

The rest of his family have not been great ethier his younger sister (15) she was always making digs towards me and when my partner lived there she was very nasty towards him and the mum let her get away with it. His Nan and grandad have also made assumptions like they said “does she get handouts from you” aka money and if I ever met them I can’t talk about my hobbies etc. I have also been compared to his cousins (26) older  ex girlfriend who as far as I’m aware had special needs and autism and apparently we are similar looks/personality, even thought they have never met me ..the cousin said this at a meet-up he went too but I believe it was his mothers sister who said this as they have a private group chat called “just us 3” (mother,Nan and sister)which I was made aware they are quite horrible in this chat so it wouldn’t surprise me”

So to get to the point my partner has recently decided he wants to “move on” with things between him and his mother and unfortunately this has happened so many times and she has been given so many chances but she ALWAYS does the same thing and can’t help but say something nasty.

He has tried meeting her for coffee but she can’t help but say something about me or him.. leaving me to think she will never change but my partner just won’t listen and wants to make amends.

As much as I can’t stop him and even if I don’t get involved,I believe this relationship can’t progress forward as I don’t believe I can forgive her and just *move on* so then internally it will affect me and my partner’s relationship as she will want to be involved with everything and I won’t want her too like moving out/marriage etc

So I guess what am asking is for advice and AITAH ..should I just move on or call it quits?

I'll charge a budget-friendly amount of Php399 for basic mock interview session (parang nilibre mo nako ng kape + pastries sa coffee shop lol) What you can expect:
-30-minutes mock interview session with me as your interviewer and questions curated to your need (our conversation would be like the usual run of how recruiters go through and screen your profile and non negotiables of some hiring managers in the role that you're applying for. Also if you have particular items that you need us to go over)
-simulated interview session where you can practice how you go around with the interview
-my feedback and pointers from our interview session to guide you for your future interviews

All interview sessions are done via Google Meet. You can create a throwaway if you're not comfortable sharing your personal details. Rest assured all information disclosed will be treated with utmost confidentiality. I'll also be sharing my LinkedIn profile for legit check during our transaction too in case needed lol 

If this is something of interest, feel free to message me for the transaction details or if you want to know more. 👋

(PS: I can also do a quick resume check in case you needed another set of eyes to review your resume. Pls note that I'll only give my comments and suggestions but will not go over and edit it.)

(another PS: If you're also looking for freelance recruiter to help you manage your hiring,, I'm all ears for a discussion)",0,1729001752.0,classifiedsph,1,0.5,False

There is a Starbucks, Southdown Coffee and pretty much nowhere else to sit and work/study. Southdown doesn’t have wifi and other places SoulBrew (which is now something else) doesn’t allow you to work. 

I’d love to hear about neighborhood coffee shops around the island I can drive to and work. Suggestions welcome. ",2,1729001629.0,longisland,8,1.0,False
