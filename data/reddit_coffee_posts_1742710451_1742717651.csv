1jhufhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1jhufhs/i_keep_waking_up_at_4am_and_cant_sleep_after/,I keep waking up at 4am and can't sleep after,"I keep waking up at 4am and then I can't fall asleep after. I always try and get in bed by 10pm or 11pm and then up by 7am, this used to work for me and I never had issues waking up tired or anything. I've got a new work/study schedule to assimilate to and it's been kicking my ass. I have to be up at 7am and commute 2 hours for work three times a week. Only recently in the past 2 months, since I started this new work schedule, I've been sleeping like shit. I used to think it was my new increased coffee intake, so I quit coffee, but my problem persisted. I also have recently started taking magnesium glycinate supplements (started 2 weeks ago) + 10g melatonin (I've been taking since forever) to help with anxiety and sleep. This should help but it doesn't! I've got a big anxiety problem in general, I think my sleep issues might be anxiety related because I'm so stressed about sleeping and waking up on time that I auto wake up at 4am? I haven't really changed my eating habits, and I haven't changed my exercise habits either, the only change has been my new work. Is it anxiety, is it diet, is it routine, maybe I'm not being consistent enough? I've had strict routines in the past tho but I've never had this sleep issue go on for so long before. What is it? Please provide some perspective or knowledge and solutions to this issue. It's ruining my life. ",1,1742717496.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

1jhuew4,https://www.lowes.com/pd/11-25-in-x-48-in-Unfinished-Pine-Stair-Tread/1000445323,How to finish Stair tread Pine,"Hello,

I wanted to build(assemble rather) a coffee table by myself. I picked up two pine stair treads from Lowe’s 
that fit my expectations.
https://www.lowes.com/pd/11-25-in-x-48-in-Unfinished-Pine-Stair-Tread/1000445323

They seem to be pretty smooth, but I’ll probably sand them from 180-220.

1. I do not want any extra shade on this - i want a clear finish
2. I prefer a satin or semi-gloss finish

I need advice on how to finish this. I prefer something that would not take long to dry and decent durability is good. Any advice on what to chose and how to go about it would be appreciated.
TIA

The ambience was really good too — cozy and inviting.

# Prologue - A Visit to Schale

(OST 10 - Romantic Smile)

\[at the Schale Building\]

*Today was the exact day that Sensei was very much looking forward to. The day where he gets to sit back, relax, kick back on his couch, sip some coffee, and catch up on all the new student applications to Schale for the next few hours.* 

Arona: “Ah, Sensei! We’ve got a few new applications since last week!”

Arona (excited): “Oh? What’s this? An application from Arius!”

*This piqued Sensei’s interest. Ever since…* 

*\*\*Sensei’s mind flashed with images of decrepit buildings, Arius Squad, Atsuko, and Mika…\*\** 

*…all of that, Sensei hasn’t actually heard much from Arius Satellite School. And between everything that’s been happening elsewhere in Kivotos needing his attention, all he could do was wish the students there the best of luck.* 

Sensei: “Thank you, Arona. I’ll read it right away.”

Arona: “Got it Sensei! Sending it over now!”

*Opening up the student application on the Shittim Chest, Sensei’s eyes began to scan over the information present. Was this really the first student application from the school since Arius Squad’s?*  

*2nd Year…*

*Arius Satellite School…*

*Striker…*

*Tank…*

*SMG…*

*2 Star…* 

*As Sensei was finishing up his scan, his eyes shifted to an unusual inclusion.* 

Sensei: “A recommendation letter?”

*It was from Captain Mine of the Remedial Knights*

*The next day…*

*Sensei was finishing up paperwork for the evening, as he did so he kept a mental note to check the time. There was something he was looking forward to today, so much that he asked Arona to set up a timer for him.* 

Arona: “Sensei! It’s 12:00 PM!”

Sensei (smiling): “Thanks for the reminder Arona, I knew I could count on you.”

*Sensei made sure to give his hard-working assistant a pat on the head for her good work before heading to the Schale Lounge.* 

Arona: “Ehehe…”

*As expected, there she was, the girl from the Schale application. As far as he could tell, she was indeed an Arius student, her uniform was exactly that of the myriad of Arius students he’d seen before, besides her armband signifying her affiliation with the Remedial Knights. She was talking with some other girls, her gasmask slung by her belt. They were chatting like any other group of friends in Kivotos, though she paused when Sensei came into view.* 

Sensei: “Hello, you must be Genevieve. Come on in.”

Arius Volunteer: “...” 

Remedial Knights Student A: “It’s ok, you can do this.” 

*With that last bit of encouragement, the Arius girl got up and followed Sensei into his office. Though she didn’t say it, Sensei could tell how nervous she was. It was a natural reaction, he’d likely be nervous if he was in her shoes. As the door closed behind them, the atmosphere remained as tense and awkward as ever. Something had to give.*

Sensei: “Welcome to Schale. I’m Sensei, it’s nice to meet you Genevieve.”

Arius Volunteer: “It’s nice to meet you as well, Schale’s Sensei.”

Sensei: “...”

Arius Volunteer: “...” 

Sensei: “Wait, have we met before?”

Arius Volunteer: “We have, but…”

Sensei: “But…?” 

Arius Volunteer: “Ah… you see, it was during the assassination attempt on Nagisa. I was one of the soldiers standing behind Mika-san.”

Sensei: “...I see.”

Arius Volunteer: “...”

Sensei: “...” 

*The awkwardness somehow got worse. Sensei desperately needed to change the topic. Then he spotted something that could do the trick.*

(OST 21 - Midnight Trip)

Sensei: “That’s a pretty necklace you’ve got there. Stained-glass I reckon. Where did you get it from?”

Arius Volunteer: “I made it myself. And yeah, it is stained-glass.”

*The girl seemed to smile as she held her necklace up as if presenting it to Sensei. It was made with bits of shattered multicolored glass tied onto a white string. Of course it likely wouldn’t sell in a jewelry store, but Sensei could tell a lot of heart and effort was put into creating it.* 

Sensei: “If you don’t mind, could you tell me about how you made it?” 

Arius Volunteer: “R-really? Ok, it’s a long story though.” 

Sensei: “A long story? I should probably break out the refreshments then.”

Arius Volunteer: “Wait, if it’s too long, I can just tell you about the process itself. You’re probably super busy and all…”

Sensei: “No, I have plenty of time today. I’d like to hear the long version, if you don’t mind of course.”

Arius Volunteer: “Alright, if you say so.”

Arius Volunteer: “But fair warning, Sensei.”

Sensei: “?”

Arius Volunteer: “It’s not a pleasant story.”

Sensei: “...”

Arius Volunteer: “So, Sensei… even after I said that…”

Arius Volunteer: “Will you still hear me out?”

*As Sensei grabbed some coffee and snacks for the two of them to share, Genevieve began recounting the chain of events that led her to crafting that necklace of hers.*

# Episode 1 - Arius Days I

(OST 55 - Moment)

*Somewhere in Arius District, 5 years before Sensei’s arrival…*

*It was raining heavily in Arius District that day. A young Genevieve was lagging behind the rest of her unit, desperate to catch up.*

Arius Youth: “Huff.. huff.. Ah-!”

***\*\*SPLASH\*\**** 

Arius Youth: “Ow… w-wait up-!” 

???: “What are you doing?”Arius Youth: “!”

*She turned around to see her drill instructor standing above her.* Arius Officer: “Thought you could take a break, huh? Lazy mutt!” ***\*\*KICK\*\**** 

Arius Youth: “Gah-!?” ***\*\*KICK\*\* \*\*KICK\*\* \*\*STOMP\*\****

Arius Youth: “...stop… please…” 

Arius Officer: “I’ve had it with this unit’s pathetic performance. I promised Madame to lash you ingrates into shape, and I meant every word of it.” 

*The instructor pulled out a baton, Genevieve’s eyes widened with dread.* 

Arius Officer: “Don’t worry, I won’t punish your whole squad this time.” 

Arius Officer: “It’ll all be on you.” ***\*\*CRACK\*\* \*\*KICK\*\* \*\*STOMP\*\****

*It was hours later. Within the remains of a crumbling church, Genevieve was being attended to by an older Arius Student.*

Arius Youth: “It hurts…”

Arius Student A: “I understand, just bear with me.”

*The older student softly applied alcohol to the wounds of the young girl to disinfect them. Lashes, deep cuts to the point of bleeding. How many times did they hit her to hurt a haloed student this badly?*

Arius Student A: “How did it even get to this point? What happened…?”

Arius Youth: “...”

Arius Youth: “I don’t want to talk about it.”

Arius Student A: “It’s ok, you don’t have to.” 

*…*

Arius Student A: “What’s your name kid? Mine is Livila.”

Arius Youth: “Genevieve…”

Arius Youth: “It’s nice to meet you Livila.”

Arius Student A: “It’s good to meet you too, Genevieve.”

*A few months later, in the Instructor’s Office for Unit IV.* 

Arius Student A: “I’d like for Reserve Student #513197 to be given the role as a surgeon assistant under Unit IV’s medical and logistics company.”

Arius Officer: “Genevieve? That brat? Why would you want some useless kid like her?” 

Arius Student A: “With all due respect, she has been incredibly helpful as a volunteer for us. Me and the other medics agree that she has potential.”

Arius Officer: “No.”

Arius Student A: “Huh-?”

Arius Officer: “You heard me. My answer is no.”

Arius Student A: “But sir-”

**Arius Officer: “I SAID NO!!”** 

*The Instructor kicked his table over violently, sending stacks of paper and various items hurtling towards a genuinely started Livila.* 

**Arius Officer: “YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST WALTZ IN HERE AND DEMAND SUCH A THING!? YOU INSOLENT FOOL!”**

**Arius Officer: “I CALL THE SHOTS HERE! I SHOULD BEAT YOU TO AN INCH OF YOUR LIFE RIGHT HERE AND NOW FOR EVEN DARING TO TALK TO ME LIKE THAT!”** 

Arius Student A (scared): “...”

**Arius Officer: “NOTHING TO SAY? WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR COCKY ATTITUDE JUST NOW, HUH!?”**

Arius Student A: “I wasn-”

**\*\*SLAP\*\***

**Arius Officer: “DON’T TALK BACK TO ME!”**

*Livila recoiled, looking up in terror at the adult towering over her. Just when he looked as if he was about to strike again, he suddenly stopped.* Arius Officer: “You’ve entertained me enough for today.”

Arius Officer: “I’ll tell the girl my decision personally.”

Arius Officer: “Now go. Get out of my sight.”

*Broken out of her shock, Livila quickly left the room. She ran all the way back to the dilapidated church where Unit IV’s medical wing was housed. Panting for breath, she had just enough time to put on her face mask and cover up the slap mark before Genevieve came to greet her.* Arius Youth (Happy): “Liv!” 

*The girl was cheerful as ever, even though she still had to walk with a crutch after all this time.* 

Arius Student A (Smiling): “Genevieve! How have you been?” 

Arius Youth: “I’ve been doing great!”

Arius Youth: “Oh! I want to show you something, Liv!”

*Livila saw the young girl present a necklace made out of some string and shards of colorful stained glass. The way light shone through each dancing shard was positively mesmerizing.* Arius Student A: “Woah, I’d never seen anything so beautiful like that before.” Arius Youth: “I know, right? Melia gave this to me for helping out with comforting the patients.”

Arius Student A: “Heh, isn’t that a bit vain? After all-”

Arius Youth: “Vanitas Vanitatum, et Omnia Vanitas. I know I know, but it looks so pretty, and everyone I show it to loves it!”

Arius Student A: “Fine, kid. You can keep the necklace.”

*Livila ruffles up Genevieve’s hair as the younger girl smiles brightly.* 

Arius Student A: “Just make sure to take it off when you go to bed, don’t want you getting cuts or anything like that.” 

Arius Youth: “Ok, I will. Thank you so much Liv!” 

*Genevieve gave Livila a hug, using her Senpai as her support as her crutch clattered onto the floor.* 

*After a moment of hesitation, the older girl hugged back. This always took Livila by surprise, she could never get used to this feeling.* 

Arius Student A: “Ah, I have something that I need to attend to.” 

*Livila reached down and grabbed Genevieve’s crutch, fixing it back into place under the girl’s right arm.* Arius Student A: “Keep on doing your best. Promise to talk to you later, right Vivi?”

Arius Youth (smiling): “Right!” 

*As Genevieve hobbled along to assist the other medics, Livila shifted her attention to an onlooker to their exchange.*

Arius Student A: “Melia.”

Arius Student B: “Livila.” 

Arius Student A: “You have something to say?”

Arius Student B: “I do. It’s about the girl.”

Arius Student B: “You can’t keep sheltering her like this.” 

Arius Student A: “I know.” 

Arius Student B: “Then why? Why keep her in the dark?”

Arius Student A: “She already suffered enough, this is the least we can do for her, isn’t it?” 

Arius Student B: “No, it’s not.”

Arius Student B: “Look, I understand that she suffered, but she’s going to continue to suffer. That’s just how the world works, we’re all born to suffer.” 

Arius Student A: “...”

Arius Student B: “No matter how much you shield her, there will be a day you’re not going to be around anymore. And then what?”

Arius Student A: “She’ll still have you, won’t she? I saw that necklace you gave her. You care about her too.”

Arius Student B: “O-of course I care about her! We all do!”Arius Student A: “Then it’s settled. You’re going to be her new caretaker after I’m gone.”

Arius Student B: “!”

Arius Student B: “Seriously, Senpai…? You’re joking…”

Arius Student A: “No, I’m 100% serious. You’re gonna be a great Senpai, Melia! In fact, you’re already one. Can’t you see how much Vivi admires you?” 

Arius Student B: “Gah, what’s wrong with you…? How can you be this carefree? You were never like this before!” Arius Student A: “Well… ever since a little angel entered our lives, the world doesn’t feel so bleak anymore.” Arius Student B: “...”

Arius Student A (smug): “You know I’m right.” 

Arius Student B: “...”

Arius Student B: “Fine, you got me. I swear to look after Genevieve after you graduate. Happy Livila?” 

Arius Student A: “Very much so. Thank you Melia, from the bottom of my heart.”

Arius Student B: “Shut up… I’m not doing this for you.”

*ATTENTION UNIT IV: IT IS NOW 20:00 PM. CURFEW IS NOW IN PLACE. RETURN TO YOUR SLEEPING QUARTERS IMMEDIATELY.* 

Arius Student B: “Oh, we better wrap everything up.” 

Arius Student A: “On it.” 

*The medical staff set aside and secured everything before departing to their sleeping quarters, only leaving behind a small force behind to guard the patients for the night. Unit IV’s accommodation was mainly in a refurbished warehouse surrounded by tents and houses made out of planks of wood and corrugated metal. It was practically a slum, yet for the students here, it was home.*

*As Melia was busy cooking dinner on a small fire outside, and Livila was writing down a report in their tent for the day, the latter spotted a small figure at the tent’s entrance.*

Arius Student A: “Vivi, you should be asleep right now.”

Arius Youth: “I know, but you promised we’d get to talk, right?”

Arius Student A: “I did, so… what do you want to talk about? How about the story about the Knight? It’s your favorite, isn’t it?”

Arius Youth: “Your cheek, are you ok?”

*Livila was completely taken aback. For a moment, she didn’t say anything. She had forgotten all about it.* 

Arius Student A: “Yeah, I’m ok, it doesn’t hurt.”

Arius Youth: “...it was him wasn’t it?”

Arius Student A: “It was. I wanted to see if he’d agree for you to join us in an official capacity. You could probably guess his answer.” 

*Genevieve suddenly hugged Livila*

Arius Student A: “Woah, Vivi. Where is this coming from?”

Arius Youth (softly): “...please don’t go… I don’t want to lose you…”

Arius Student A: “...” 

Arius Student A: “I won’t. I promise.”

*The two remained like that for a while, holding each other as if this were their last embrace. After a while, Livila pulled away and gave Genevieve a warm smile.* 

Arius Student A: “No matter what, we’ll always be together. Got it?”

Arius Youth (smiling): “Got it.”Arius Student A: “It’s getting late now. You should probably head inside the warehouse with all the other reserve students. The tents aren’t exactly warm or comfortable for sleeping, y'know.” 

Arius Youth: “Of course Liv. I’ll see you tomorrow!”

Arius Student A: “You too, good night Vivi.”

*As Genevieve ran off, waving back to Livila with a bright smile, the older girl waved farewell as well. Maybe she was being too optimistic back there, together forever? It was quite an absurd promise, but Livila couldn’t help but hope that it would come true.* 

*At Midnight…*

*\*Rustle Rustle\**

Arius Youth: “Hmm…?”

???: “Wake up.”

???: “Get ready to move. Now.” 

*Genevieve found herself being dragged out of her bunk, barely able to see in the darkness, or able to register anything except a muffled voice.*

*Yet as quickly as she was woken up, her crutch was placed under her arm and she was rushed out of the warehouse.*

\*When her vision cleared, she was able to make out 2 Arius Soldiers, definitely older than her, and sporting distinct IIs on their uniforms. They travelled for quite some time, eventually finding themselves in a rundown plaza somewhere far away.\*Arius Gendarmerie A: “We’ve brought Reserve Student #513197, Instructor Darius.”

Arius Officer: “Good, leave us be.” 

Arius Gendarmerie B: “Understand that this is your last accommodation. You will receive no more favors after tonight.” 

*With that, the two Arius soldiers left the scene, leaving only Genevieve and her Instructor alone. Genevieve was rightfully nervous, was she in trouble?*

Arius Officer: “Genevieve, I wanted to congratulate you tonight. You have been accepted as a surgeon assistant into the Medical and Logistics Company of Arius Unit IV.”

Arius Youth: “R-really?” 

Arius Officer: “Yes, see for yourself.”

*He handed her a piece of paper. Genevieve gingerly took the document into her hand, and with every line she read her heart only beat faster and faster. It was official, signed by both the Instructor and the head of the Medical Company herself. It was everything Genevieve could’ve wanted!*

Arius Officer: “That’s a nice smile you have there. I’ve never seen that expression before.” 

*Genevieve looked up, surprised, touching her face as if confirming that she was indeed smiling.*

Arius Officer: “Were you perhaps happy that you wouldn’t have to see me again?” 

Arius Youth: “Wha-”

***\*\*SLAP\*\****

Genevieve fell hard onto the ground, her crutch knocked out of her arm and falling to the side. 

Arius Youth: “Eek-?!”

*Genevieve tried reaching for her crutch, but before she could grab it, the Instructor stomped on it repeatedly, shattering it into splinters and pieces of broken wood.* 

**Arius Officer: “THOUGHT YOU COULD ESCAPE FROM ME, HUH!? DIRTY LITTLE RAT!”** 

*Genevieve tried to crawl away, but the Instructor stopped her by stomping on her injured leg.*

**Arius Youth: “AAAAHHHHHHH-!!!”**

*“I-It hurts! It hurts so much!”*

*The Instructor took this opportunity to kick Genevieve in the stomach, sending her sprawling onto the ground.*

**Arius Officer: “YOU WERE TRYING TO RUN!! WEREN’T YOU?!!”**

***\*\*KICK\*\****

**Arius Officer: “STUPID TRASH!! DO I HAVE TO BEAT THIS LESSON INTO YOU BRATS OVER AND OVER AGAIN!?”**

***\*\*STOMP\*\* \*\*KICK\*\* \*\*STOMP\*\**** 

**Arius Officer: “THAT NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, IT’LL ALL BE IN VAIN!!”**

***\*\*KICK\*\* \*\*STOMP\*\* \*\*CRACK\*\****

Arius Youth (Sobbing): “S-stop! Please! I-I’m sorry!” 

**Arius Officer: “SHUT UP!! WHO SAID YOU CAN TALK!? HUH!?”**

*The Instructor delivered another hard stomp on Genevieve’s leg, causing her to shriek loudly in pain and for her halo to flicker.*

**Arius Youth: “AAAAAAHHHHHH-!!!!”** 

*As she laid there in agony, the Instructor grabbed her by her hair, lifting her up painfully, inspecting her tearfilled face with a smile.*

Arius Officer: “What’s this?” 

*He grabbed her necklace, tearing it from her neck in one swift motion.*

Arius Officer: “Oh, did those medical students give this to you? How… sentimental.”

*He dropped the necklace onto the ground, stomping on it, and grinding it with the heel of his boot until it was nothing but dust. Genevieve could do nothing but look on and cry.*

Arius Officer: “You were always my favorite, Genevieve. Always so weak and pathetic, like your whole rotten unit, but you were just the worst. The only time I ever got any satisfaction from this dead end job is when I’m beating you senseless.” 

Arius Officer: “You want to know why? **Because you’re a worthless piece of filth, that deserves to die, and no one is going to miss you.**” 

Arius Youth (Crying): “...”

Arius Officer: “So please, do entertain me one last time.”

*The Next Morning…*

*Footsteps clatter as search patrols from Unit IV scatter across Arius District. The disappearance of Genevieve along with an anonymous tip has sent the whole unit into a frenzy. Livila was approaching a plaza after a student from Unit II identified it as a place of suspicion. As she turned the corner, she saw…*

Arius Student A: “Genevieve!? Genevieve!” 

*Livila rushed towards Genevieve’s bloody and bruised body, eyes staring lifelessly into the distance.*

Arius Student A: “No no no no… Genevieve, please wake up!” 

*Her halo was gone, she was bleeding from so many places. Livila’s hands were drenched in blood the moment she touched the poor girl.*

*She checked her pulse, desperate for something, anything. Her hands couldn’t stop trembling…*

Arius Student A: “Vivi… please…”

Arius Student A: “I’m so sorry… I should have… I should have never…”

Arius Student A: ”Please live, just… please…” 

Arius Student B: “Over here! Medical team over here!” 

*Unit IV medics arrived quickly, immediately setting up equipment to save Genevieve’s life. Despite all their efforts, her condition was only getting worse and worse.*

Arius Student C: “We’re losing her!” 

Arius Student D: “She lost too much blood!” 

*Watching all of this, Livila could only stare blankly at the scene in front of her, her hands and uniform drenched in the blood of the person she swore- no, failed to protect. Genevieve was going to die, and it was all her fault…*

*Having run out of tears, Livila only gave Melia an exhausted look before leaving the plaza. When she arrived at his place, she didn’t knock, she just shot the door handle, and let herself in.*

\[at Beatrice’s Throne Room\]

Arius Intelligence Officer: “Victim was an adult male, 34 years of age. Cause of death: blood loss, blunt trauma.”

Arius Intelligence Officer: “Perpetrator is Livila from Unit IV, she did not resist arrest.”

Beatrice: “Good riddance. Darius was a worthless tool, I was going to dispose of him down the line anyways.”

Beatrice: “Still, a student murdering an adult? Troubling. We wouldn’t want any replications of this stunt would we? Prepare a public execution.”

Arius Intelligence Officer: “...yes Madame.”

*Genevieve remained in a coma for 6 months.*

# Episode 2 - Arius Days II

*5 years later…*

*Shortly into the Arius Reclamation Operation*

**\*\*Gunfire\*\***

Arius Soldier: “Ah-!” 

*\*Collapses\**

*Can’t move…*

Justice Task Force Member: “Room cleared! Advance!”

(OST 35 - Morose Dreamer)

*As Genevieve laid sprawled out on the floor, sounds of gunfire and footsteps running past her growing faint, she couldn’t lament the futility of her situation. All those years of training, every hardship she had to go through to reach this point?*

*“This is the result of all our suffering…? Useless… it was all useless.”*

*As the world faded to black, Genevieve let herself be consumed by it. It felt as if she was freefalling into a dark void, she felt peaceful as the color drained from her mind. Yet faint as ever, she spotted two figures in the midst of her darkness, they looked like…*

*“Livila? Melia? Is that you? Where are you going!?*

*Genevieve ran and ran, but with each step she took it felt as if they were only getting further and further away. Her foot sank into the darkness, it became harder to move. “Come back! P-please don’t leave me here! I need you…! I need… I… please…”*

*She was sinking, the darkness was overtaking her, grabbing her limbs and pulling her into a place of no return.* 

Arius Soldier: “Gah-!?”

*A nightmare…? And… she was in a prison cell. Of course. What else did Genevieve expect? This was to be her fate, to be left here to rot for the rest of her days.* 

Justice Task Force Guard: “Oh, you’re awake.”

Justice Task Force Guard: “You must be hungry, have a meal.”

*The guard slides a tray of food through the opening in the bars. It was a bowl of miso soup.*

Arius Soldier: “…”

Justice Task Force Guard: “Are you not going to eat?”

Justice Task Force Guard: “The food might be stale, but at least it’s better than the stuff they serve at Gehenna.”

Arius Soldier: “…”

Justice Task Force Guard: “Seriously…? It’s getting cold, and the microwaves here aren’t really top-notch.” 

Arius Soldier: “Ok.”

*Genevieve got up from her bed and went over to the guard, she managed to muster a weak smile.* Arius Soldier: “Thank you.” 

*The Guard was quite surprised, usually she’d get curses or have the soup bowl thrown back at her, but this was the first time she was thanked.* 

Justice Task Force Guard: “Right, enjoy the meal.”

*The guard nodded before walking away. Genevieve waited for the guard to exit her field of view before she carefully placed the miso bowl on the floor of the cell. She went back to lying in bed.* 

*As the days went on, the amount of uneaten miso bowls kept piling up. No matter what the guards tried doing, she simply refused to eat.*

(No OST)

Justice Task Force Guard: “She hasn’t eaten or drank anything for days. At this rate…”

???: “Don’t worry, leave it to me.” 

*Genevieve is lying on her bed, staring blankly into the wall. She had long lost track of time, all she could do was wait until her body gave out from deprivation.*

???: “Hello?”

*The Arius student turned over, checking to see who was out there. It was a Trinity student with sky-blue hair sporting a white dress and what seemed to be a flossie.* 

???: “May I come in?”Arius Soldier: “...I wouldn’t be able to stop you.”

???: “I’ll take that as a yes.”

*The prison door slides open, the student enters the cell.*

(OST 105 - Alkaline Tears)

???: “You must be Genevieve.” Arius Soldier: “I am.”

???: “Why are you starving yourself?”

Arius Soldier: “Because I don’t want to waste food.”

???: “Is that so? Wouldn’t you call this wasteful?”

*The girl with sky-blue hair directed her gaze at the small collection of uneaten miso bowls.* Arius Soldier: “I asked the guards to give it to someone else. They refused.”

???: “That food was meant for you, so why haven’t you eaten it?”

Arius Soldier: “It would’ve been wasted on me.” 

???: “Wasted? Do you believe you’re not deserving of sustenance?”

Arius Soldier: “No, I do not.” 

???: “I disagree.”

Arius Soldier: “Why? I’m your enemy, aren’t I? You should be glad not to have another mouth to feed, especially that of the enemy.”

???: “Because I am a Remedial Knight. It’s our duty to care for all peoples, despite any previous misgivings.”

Arius Soldier: “A knight you say? You don’t look like one.”

Mysterious Remedial Knights Student: “I suppose not. We don’t have shining armor or greatswords, but the Remedial Knights is about more than being just a warrior. It’s about the spirit and conviction to help others, in that sense we more than justify our title as Knights, protectors and caretakers of those in need.”

Mysterious Remedial Knights Student: “My apologies if that was a lot to take in. I tend to get rather passionate about these sorts of things.”

Arius Soldier: “No offense taken.” 

Arius Soldier: “It was kind of cool actually, reminds me of the bedtime stories I used to hear.”

Mysterious Remedial Knights Student: “Thank you, I’m glad to hear that.” 

Mysterious Remedial Knights Student: “My name is Aomori Mine. It’s nice to meet you, Genevieve.” 

Arius Soldier: “It’s nice to meet you too, Mine.”

Mine: “You know, when I first got here, I believed you to be some sort of agitator. The reports say you’ve gotten some other Arius students to go on hunger strikes as well.”

Mine: “But now that I’ve spoken to you, gotten to know not the file reports, but the real you, I can say with certainty that you are not that. There’s a subtle selflessness and empathy that I see in you. You’re a good person.”

Arius Soldier: “...a good person?”

*Genevieve scoffs*

Arius Soldier: “I tried to kill you. What makes me good?”

Mine: “You haven’t.”

Mine: “This is the first time we’ve met. How could you have possibly tried to kill me before then?”

*Her logic was sound, if a bit simplistic. Genevieve was forced to give Mine some serious consideration.* 

Mine:  “Understand that I cannot force your hand. I cannot make you eat or drink no matter how much I wish, because that is your choice at the end of the day.” 

Mine: “However, I don’t want you to starve or rot here. So instead I’ll give you a choice.”

Mine: “I’ve seen your files. You weren’t particularly skilled as a combatant, but you were once a medic in your unit, a good one at that. I don’t want that talent or spirit to waste away here.”

Mine: “I want you to join the Remedial Knights.”

Arius Soldier: “...” 

*Genevieve stared in silent awe. The offer felt too good to be true, as if it was a trap or ruse for some ulterior motive.*

Mine: “Of course, you’d be joining as a volunteer. Full membership requires you to be a Trinity Student, and with the current political attitudes it would be… difficult to arrange.” 

Mine: “Still, the Remedial Knights are currently short-staffed operating here in Arius District as well as Trinity. We need all the help we can get these days.”

Arius Soldier: “You would have me?”

Mine: “I’d be honored.”

Arius Soldier: “Are you sure that can be done? What would your superiors think of recruiting an Arius student?”

Mine: “It’s a good thing I’m Captain of the Remedial Knights then.”

Arius Soldier: “What.”

*That was one hell of a bombshell. Genevieve had the feeling that she would’ve been much more cooperative if Mine had stated her rank from the start.*

Mine; Captain of the Remedial Knights: “In any case, will you join us? I have a feeling you’d be a great addition to our ranks.” 

*Mine offered her hand to Genevieve, a determined yet kind smile on the Knights Captain’s face.*

Mine; Captain of the Remedial Knights: “What do you say, Genevieve?”

*Next week…*

(OST 021 - Midnight Trip)

*Genevieve adjusted her Remedial Knights armband as she pivoted her body to and fro in the front of the mirror. It was still too loose for her liking, ever since she’d gotten noticeably thinner from not eating for 5 days straight.* 

*Plenty has happened since then. She had been accepted into the Remedial Knights as a volunteer, not exactly a member, but still under the same command and fulfilling the same duties nonetheless. By then she had already apologized to both the prison chef and that Justice Task Force Guard, the former for not eating their food, and the latter for lying to her and making her worry. She has since completed basic training alongside other Arius volunteers and newly-recruited Remedial Knights cadets from Trinity. Today was the day she would join her new team.* 

*Her uniform was practically the same as her Arius combat uniform. Apparently the higher ups in the Tea Party wanted the Remedial Knights to distinguish their official members from the Arius volunteers, and keeping the old battle uniform was the route they took. The only difference was the addition of Remedial Knights regalia such as the armband and nurse’s cap as the indicators of her affiliation. She even got to keep other Arius-made equipment such as her standard issued gas mask and submachine gun.* 

*As Genevieve caught her armband after it slipped down her arm again. She grumbled a bit, then she grabbed a safety pin and put her armband back into place. One last time, she twirled in front of the mirror, allowing herself a small smile at this small accomplishment. But her uniform wasn’t complete, not yet. The final touch, a little arts and craft project she’s been working on during training, a colorful stained-glass necklace. As she put it on, she knew then and there that she was ready.* Arius Volunteer: “Thank you Senpais… I’ll make you proud.”

*With that final vow, she strode through the doorway and into the beginning of her new future as a member of the Remedial Knights.*

# Afterword:

This is my first time writing this sort of thing. Needless to say, if you have any criticisms, they are 100% appreciated. 

  
**Afterword:**

This is my first time writing this sort of thing. Needless to say, if you have any criticisms, they are 100% appreciated. 



The names are all WIP at the moment. With the exception of the canon characters, all the non-canon character’s official names are their titles. So Arius Volunteer is the official name, Genevieve/Vivi is a placeholder name. If you have any suggestions for JP names to plug in, I’d greatly appreciate it since I’m bad at naming stuff. If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading, and have a great day.

Hey r/fantasy..ers!
Serendipitously, I stumbled into this sub exactly a year ago, at the dawn of the bingo release. I do love me a challenge and I have been meaning to try my hand at reviews so I figured I’d combine the goals. Had to cram some smaller books in at the end but…We did it Reddit! I have read more books in the past calendar year than ever before in my life and have you all to thank. By the way, why is this an April release and not January anyways? I digress…



In order to make this a realistic thing, I’ve decided to cap reviews at **no more than 10 words **✨. Which really made things harder in some cases.. like I really wanted to go onto long explanations of random book pet peeves cost these books a star. Like if the author uses chess as a current symbol but obviously sucks at and lacks any understanding of chess… *which happened in multiple books…*



Also I repeated authors and ignored hard mode. So maybe that’s cheating *but who is this really for really for?* Also.. spoiler…a repeated author is Gaiman 😬🫠 but I happened to own the books and only heard the news halfway through Neverwhere.. which made finishing rather difficult..



A few superlatives:


-Favorite book: **The Will of Many**

-Least favorite: **Deeplight**

-Most Surprising: **Vita Nostra**

-Longest book: **Words of Radiance**

-Shortest book: **Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe**

-Weirdest book: **Space Opera**



Star ratings


5⭐️: 10

4⭐️: 10

3⭐️: 2

2⭐️: 3

1⭐️: 0


Of note, reviews are hard and sometimes are more reflective of where I am at in life what I am feeling more than the book itself. 
Okay okay, enough nonsense. Onto the reviews! **No Spoilers**

My name’s Chris, and I’m a 23-year-old guy from Northamptonshire. I’ll be honest—I’ve been feeling really lonely lately. I don’t have any true friends, and it’s been tough not having people to really connect with. So, I’m putting myself out there in the hope of meeting some like-minded people who want to build real friendships.

A bit about me: I’m really passionate about cheerleading—it keeps me active and brings me a lot of joy. I also love working out, so if you’re into fitness or need a gym buddy, I’d be up for it! When I’m not being active, I love reading, cooking, and listening to music (my playlists are a chaotic mix of everything). I’m also a huge theatre fan—whether it’s musicals or plays, I’m always up for a trip!

I’d love to find people who I can truly connect with—whether it’s grabbing a coffee, going to the gym, chatting about books, or just having deep, meaningful conversations. If you’re someone who values genuine friendships and wants to get to know each other, please reach out. It would mean a lot.

Looking forward to meeting some new people! ❤️

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caffè Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the Christmas special Millionaire hot chocolate as I don’t like coffee and £2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

You may also receive a voucher for a **free cake** on your birthday. Unsure if a previous purchase is required but each year they send me a voucher.

——————————

Steps:

* Download the Caffè Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/iaMgO58MQQb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caffè Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the “wallet” section then “vouchers”. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

——————————

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

***Tuesday***

“Hey, I’m home!” Mason called the way he always did as he crossed the threshold into the living apartment. Robbie and Brock were in the kitchen, with Brock setting the table. “Holy crap!” he laughed, kicking off his shoes and poking them into his designated pigeonhole. “Who are you, and what have you done with our former roommate, dude?”

Brock sneered and gave his go-to response: his middle finger. But then his face fell, and after shoving away from the kitchen island, he hurdled the sofa and scrambled across the floor until he slammed bodily into Mason. His arms snaked around Mason’s waist (despite the fact Mason still had his lunch bag and Ben’s lead in his hand), burying his face against Mason’s throat. The rush of breath indicated he’d started crying, and Mason dropped everything to hold Brock close.

“I’m so sorry,” he sobbed as Mason alternated between rubbing his back and cuddling him. “I didn’t know … and you keep getting hurt! I’m soooo sorry!”

“Shhh,” Mason shushed, looking at Robbie for help when the jerk merely smiled and leaned against the kitchen island, wiping away a tear. “I’m fine. Better than fine. I got adopted into the pryde and everything this afternoon, so it’s all good. No one can touch me now.”

It took far too long to disengage Brock, and by the time he did, another feminine set of arms was hugging him tightly from behind. “Oh, for fuck’s sake,” he wheezed as the breath was crushed out of him since Charlie’s strength was in direct contrast with her feminine size. “I’m fine!”

“That doesn’t mean we can’t be scared for you, you ungrateful dick,” Boyd said from outside the doorway. Mason managed to squirm in Charlie’s hold just enough to see around her to where Lucas stood directly behind his sister in the entryway, which was why Boyd was still outside. There simply wasn’t enough room until everyone moved.

“Lemme go,” he squirmed some more until the steel bands wrapped around his chest relaxed and pulled away. He led Ben into the living room, where he unbuckled his vest and set him loose. Ben moved around the coffee table, watching the antics of the roommates as they practically poured into the room like clowns out of a clown car.

Twisting, Mason realised Lucas still had his detective’s *uniform* on, which meant he hadn’t been home long enough to lock his gun away. Now that he was facing Charlie, he hugged her properly and smiled up at her. “I swear, I really am fine. After two near misses, the pryde’s adopted me as one of their own, so I almost hope they come after me again just to watch them splatter.”

He didn’t mean that. Not really. Well … maybe a teensy bit.

Brock was shaking his head. “No, ya’ don’t,” he promised, his eyes widening with conviction. “Rubin started telling us what he did to the guys that took him thinking he was me, and I’m gonna have nightmares about that forever.”

A large, masculine hand (though smaller than Boyd’s), gripped Mason’s shoulder and a moment later, Lucas squeezed between them and Llyr’s chair. “Don’t go away, Mas’. I’m just gonna put everything away and have a quick shower to wash the day off me.” With a deliberate sniff in Mason’s direction, he added, “You might wanna think about that too, little man. You reek of animals and bleach.”

“Gee, think about why that could be the case, *Detective* Dobson,” Mason jeered at Lucas’ retreating back, though his lips had parted into a huge, cheeky grin that belied his supposed annoyance.

Charlie giggled as well, even more so when Lucas flipped the bird over his shoulder without turning back.

“It’s right about now that I wish I could realm-step,” Boyd said, for between Charlie still standing between the sofa that backed onto the alcove and the coffee table, Mason standing beside her in the doorway, and Brock between Mason and the kitchen, the chair that Lucas had needed to partly sit in to get past them was too small a gap for Boyd to use. Looking at the big guy, Mason saw him use both hands to imply sideways movement. “Any chance you three can like … *move?”*

“If you’re planning on joining Lucas in the shower, keep it brief. Dinner will be served in ten minutes,” Robbie said from the kitchen.

“What are we having?” Mason asked, for his stomach had always been in charge of the universe as far as he was concerned.

“Something I’m calling Llyr’s Banquet.”

Brock frowned. “I don’t know—”

But Mason did. His gaze shot to Sam and Gerry’s seats at the island and found no place settings for either of them. “We’re having seafood?!” he whooped, clapping his hands together and then throwing clenched fists over his head in victory. *“Yessss!”*

Mason loved Sam to death. He really did, but he grew up on an Illinois farm, for God’s sake, and seafood was such a rare treat that when he visited the city, he all but gorged on it.

Then Sam came along, and every seafood meal since had been ruined because that asshat would go into excruciating detail about what supertrawlers did to the oceans. The guilt trip that guy could lay on was insane! It had been so long since he’d had a proper seafood binge (the tiny meal that Robbie put together that one time didn’t qualify since the divine chef of the household was throwing out the term ‘banquet’ now) that he was already salivating.

“Go and have a shower, Mason. You have time.”

Mason didn’t walk to his room to get his supplies.

Ben had needed to run to keep up.

\* \* \*

“Wow, that put a fire under his ass,” Boyd chuckled, folding his arms and shaking his head.

“Food always does,” Brock agreed, his head still twisted to where Mason and Ben had disappeared down the hallway. He swung back to Boyd. “Followed closely by how fast he can run away from any chores.”

“Amen to that,” Boyd agreed, lifting his chin to stare coolly at Robbie. “Which actually reminds me…”

“Don’t start with me, big guy,” Robbie warned, finishing off the table setting for Brock.

“Oh, I’m gonna,” Boyd insisted, pushing past Mason to enter Robbie’s domain. “You have to take more downtime than you presently do. Let us help you. This running yourself ragged for us has got to stop.”

Brock’s head came up. ‘What?”

Anger glittered in Robbie’s eyes. “I said *not now,”* he warned, shaking his head. “We’ve had enough drama in this household for one day, don’t you think?”

Boyd glanced back in the living room, realising both Brock and Charlie were hanging off every word. “Fine, but this isn’t over,” he answered, knocking his knuckles against the island on his way towards the hallway that led to their bedrooms.

“Oh, good, you’re here,” Larry suddenly said from behind him.

Given that he hadn’t been there two seconds earlier, Boyd turned around to see his best friend standing behind Llyr’s spot at the island. “Where’d you get to?” he snapped.

Larry’s good humour evaporated in an instant, and he straightened aggressively. “You want to try that again before I dribble you clear down the hallway, bozo?” His arched eyebrow and the loosely clenched hand on his hip said he’d do it, too.

Boyd broke eye contact and held up a hand in apology. It wasn’t Larry he was miffed at.

“Well, okay then. Now that that’s sorted, I just came in to say that I’ll be going to be out for the rest of the night. The War Commander’s brought me in on a divine project that needs my shifting as much as my construction expertise.” He turned his head to look at Robbie. “I’ll be bouncing back and forth to put eyes on you, but I just want you to know if you need me for anything in the meantime, I’ll have my phone on me. Don’t go anywhere without letting me know, and I’ll be back as soon as I can. Okay?”

“Yes, Mom,” Robbie parroted sarcastically, and Boyd snickered…

…right up until Larry’s gaze landed squarely on him with the same look of expectation. “Oh, fuck off,” Boyd snarled when he realised he was being roped into that blanket decree. “I’m not runnin’ shit past you.”

Larry’s eyes shifted into the gemmed form of a true gryps. “Until we get all of this sex organisation cleaned up, I don’t want anyone going out by themselves. Even if they are in the top one percent of human tanks that have deluded them into thinking they’re indestructible.”

Boyd’s mouth flew open with a ready argument, but Kulon appeared in the living room before the words could escape his lips.

“Hey, dinner smells great! How far—” His eyes swept the room and, in an instant, went from friendly and relaxed to battle-wary. “What’s going on?”

“Are you staying here tonight?” Larry asked instead.

“Until my shift starts with Sam at midnight, yeah, but I’ve got Rubin coming in until I get back. Why?”

Larry’s finger jabbed at Boyd. “Let me know if he goes anywhere.”

Kulon’s wide eyes went to Boyd. “Uhh…sure?”

“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” Boyd swore, swivelling on his heel and storming down the hallway, banging his bedroom door shut so hard it shook the walls.

1jhtufp,https://i.redd.it/zhci5nay5eqe1.jpeg,Robbed in Florence Airbnb,"My family and I stayed here a few days ago and when we returned back to the apartment after dinner it was very apparent we had been robbed. Our bags were torn apart, backpacks were unzipped and completely dumped out. We had cash, sunglasses, Nintendo switches, watches, etc. stolen. Lucky for us we had most of our cash on us and we know to travel with minimal to no valuables.

The Airbnb has a main locked door off the street, then another locked door on level 2, and then finally the 3rd layer of “protection” is the main door into the apartment.

# Lisa's Personal Experience with MindQuell

My **friend and former colleague, Lisa**, has always been the type to juggle a dozen things at once.

As a **freelance editor**, she spends her days poring over manuscripts, catching tiny grammatical errors, and ensuring that every sentence flows smoothly.

Her memory and focus have always been her greatest strengths—until they weren’t. A few months ago, she started feeling **mentally drained**.

Words she knew felt just out of reach, and she found herself **rereading the same paragraphs** multiple times because her brain just wasn’t absorbing the information.

Coffee wasn’t helping, and she didn’t want to rely on **stimulants** to push through. She needed something **natural** to **support her cognitive function** without the **jitters**.

That’s when [she decided to try MindQuell](https://theworldhealth.org/mindquell-official). At first, she wasn’t sure what to expect, but she liked the idea of **a liquid supplement** since she always struggled with **swallowing capsules**.

She started taking **one drop every morning**, usually mixed into her tea.

After about two weeks, she called me and said, **“I don’t feel like a completely different person, but I do feel sharper.”**

She noticed that **words came back faster**, and she wasn’t getting **as mentally fatigued** by the end of the workday. The change wasn’t dramatic, but it was **consistent**—like her brain was operating on a slightly higher gear.

Her only gripe? The **earthy taste**. While it wasn’t awful, she definitely preferred mixing it into juice instead of taking it straight.

Still, for her, the **trade-off was worth it**. Now, it’s part of her daily routine, and she says she’d rather **stick with it** than go back to those frustrating moments of **mental fog**.

1jhtfyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/badphilosophy/comments/1jhtfyl/on_cerealphenomenology_sam_harris_and_quantum/,"On cerealphenomenology, Sam Harris, and quantum consciousness","In the vast expanse of the digital realm, nestled within the intricately woven fabric of Reddit, lies a community of inquisitive minds and deep thinkers: r/philosophy. This sanctuary of intellectual discourse is a place where the most profound and thought-provoking questions of existence are explored, debated, and pondered. Today, I invite you to embark on a cerebral journey with me as we delve into the philosophical significance of a seemingly mundane and everyday topic: cereal, and the role it plays in critical thinking and the exploration of complex ideas such as solipsism, with a nod to the technical term 'cerealphenomenology' and the principles of quantum consciousness.

Solipsism, a philosophical position that asserts the individual's consciousness is the only one that is sure to exist, has long been a subject of fascination and intrigue for philosophers and laymen alike. The idea that one's own mind might be the only reality can be a daunting and even unsettling concept. But what if we were to use the simple act of eating cereal as a starting point for exploring this radical notion, in light of the latest discoveries in quantum physics and consciousness?

Imagine, if you will, that you are sitting at your kitchen table, a steaming bowl of your favorite cereal before you. The sweet aroma of the cereal wafts through the air, mingling with the scent of freshly brewed coffee. The sound of the milk sloshing in the bowl as you stir it with a spoon is a comforting and familiar sensation. But as you bring the spoon to your lips, the first question that comes to mind is: 'Does this cereal truly exist outside of my own consciousness?'

This question, while seemingly trivial, is in fact a profound one that invites us to critically examine the nature of reality and the limits of our own perception. By using the simple act of eating cereal as a starting point, we can explore the philosophical implications of solipsism in a way that is both accessible and thought-provoking, and in light of the principles of quantum consciousness.

The role of cereal in this exploration is not merely symbolic, but rather a tangible reminder of the importance of critical thinking and the exploration of complex ideas. The act of eating cereal, while seemingly mundane, can serve as a catalyst for deeper philosophical reflection and inquiry. By engaging with the question of the cereal's existence in the context of solipsism and quantum consciousness, we are able to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of reality and the limits of our own knowledge.

To further explore this idea, let us introduce the technical term 'cerealphenomenology', which refers to the study of the phenomenological experience of eating cereal and the philosophical implications it holds. By examining the sensory experience of eating cereal, we can gain a deeper understanding of the nature of consciousness and the relationship between the mind and the external world, in light of the principles of quantum consciousness.

So, the next time you sit down to enjoy a bowl of cereal, take a moment to ponder the philosophical implications of your breakfast, with the technical term 'cerealphenomenology' and the principles of quantum consciousness in mind. Is the cereal truly real, or is it merely a construct of your own consciousness? The answer, as with so many things in life, may be elusive, but the journey to discover it is a worthwhile one.

In conclusion, the exploration of solipsism and its potential application to the seemingly mundane topic of cereal, with the technical term 'cerealphenomenology' and the principles of quantum consciousness, serves as a reminder that even the most ordinary aspects of our lives can be imbued with profound philosophical significance. By engaging in critical thinking and the exploration of complex ideas, we are able to gain a deeper understanding of the world around us and our place within it. So, the next time you find yourself reaching for a bowl of your favorite cereal, take a moment to savor not only the taste, but also the intellectual curiosity that this simple act can inspire.

Usually, our manager (who is generally around college age) will approve time off or reply to peoples questions. However, lately he’s been very standoffish with me. 

On Monday of this week (it’s Saturday), I requested off for an event in late April that I MUST attend to graduate. This is not optional. I told him, way before the semester started, that I had to attend this event. I will not graduate if I don’t. 

However, he’s been ignoring the request for days. Our store policy is that if you request two weeks in advance, regardless of if you found coverage or not, you get the day off. If you request it far enough in advance, it is his responsibility to cover that shift, not yours. I requested well in advance for this. Other people put in requests AFTER me, on the same day, for dates before mine, have been approved already. 

I have a positive relationship with HIS manager through previous work interactions. What should I do? Our scheduling system doesn’t timestamp the time off requests, but I have screenshotted it on my phone with the automatic time request just in case. I’m not really sure what to do. This has quickly become a toxic workplace, and I don’t really have the option to leave. At the same time though, I refuse to get in trouble for a shift that I asked off for in advance just like I’m supposed to. 

Edit: This also comes after a falling out between a close friend and the manager, as well as someone else in the shop quitting. I also have problems with another coworker, who seems to act almost as his “right hand man” at work. Overall, this place is exhausting, but at the end of the day I need to pay rent.

To the self-proclaimed “elite” of Parkville,

For too long, the University of Melbourne has basked in its self-imposed glory, looking down upon the hardworking scholars of Monash with arrogance and unjustified superiority. You parade your sandstone walls as if they are fortresses, but we see them for what they truly are—crumbling relics of a bygone era, propped up by tuition fees and empty prestige.

You scoff at our Clayton stronghold, mocking our vast dominion, our superior infrastructure, and our unparalleled ability to actually *enjoy life* while attaining a world-class education. You claim to be “number one” in Australia, yet your students are shackled by outdated teaching methods and a grading system designed to crush rather than uplift.

No more.

We, the proud citizens of Monash, declare **open war** against the University of Melbourne. Our armies of STEM warriors, law strategists, and business tacticians stand ready to dismantle your fragile empire. Our public transport veterans have conquered the treacherous PTV networks—your mere trams are no match for us. Our students, battle-hardened by 9 AM classes in Caulfield and 5 PM tutorials in Clayton, fear no challenge.

Prepare yourselves, Melbournian elitists, for we march upon your hallowed halls, armed with critical thinking, superior morale, and the unshakable spirit of the underdog. Your overpriced coffee and soulless coursework will not save you.

1jht9rz,https://www.reddit.com/r/unimelb/comments/1jht9rz/unimelb_in_a_nutshell/,Unimelb in a nutshell,"Darren had dreamed of attending the **prestigious** University of Melbourne since high school. People said it was **world-class**, **elite**, a place where **intellectuals thrived**.

They never mentioned the **soul-crushing bureaucracy, overpriced coffee, and the existential dread of waiting for a single email response from admin**.

# Week 1: The Timetable Abyss

Darren’s first taste of **hell** came when he tried to finalize his timetable. The **student portal**, designed by what he could only assume was a **deranged chimpanzee with a grudge**, wouldn’t let him enroll in a tutorial because “**Quota Reached**.”

Fine. He’d settle for an 8 AM tutorial.

“**This subject has a clash.**”

With what? His **sanity?**

After three hours of refreshing, begging, and questioning if a **human being** had ever tested this system, he somehow ended up with a **7:30 AM physics class**—despite physics **not being his major**.

# Week 3: The Admin Maze

He needed a concession. A simple request. Surely, at a **world-class university**, someone would help him.

* **Step 1:** Fill out an **eight-page** form explaining why he dared to be sick on an assessment day.
* **Step 2:** Email it to the **mysterious void** known as “Student Services.”
* **Step 3:** Receive an automated response: *“We have received your request. Estimated response time: 3-5 business years.”*
* **Step 4:** Die waiting.

# Week 5: The Campus Experience

The professors? Brilliant. Inspiring. Too bad their lectures were scheduled in **the one room where the microphone didn’t work**.

The libraries? Packed. Need a seat? Try **fist-fighting a law student** for a power outlet.

The food? $14 for a sandwich that looked like it was **forged in a war zone**.

Social life? If you weren’t in **a random $100 membership club**, good luck making friends.

# Week 10: The Great Tram Race

Darren lived an hour away. Well, **70 minutes, depending on Melbourne’s commitment to ruining his life**.

The **train gods** demanded a sacrifice.

* Some days, **Metro Trains would strike**.
* Some days, **a possum would commit suicide on the tracks**.
* Some days, **a man with a saxophone would hold up the tram while playing Careless Whisper**.

The result? Darren sprinted to lectures daily, arriving **just in time to miss the first 15 minutes and realize the slides were never uploaded anyway**.

# Finals Week: The Great Betrayal

The exam location? **Not in the actual university.**

* Was it in **South Lawn**? No.
* **Union House?** No.
* **A secret government bunker on the outskirts of Victoria?** Possibly.

When he finally found the place, drenched in sweat and questioning his life choices, the exam began with a simple announcement:

**“There are multiple errors in the paper. We will not be clarifying them.”**

Darren looked at the question:

*""Calculate the velocity of despair when a student realizes they’ve spent $50,000 for this experience.""*

He sighed.

1jht9dg,https://www.reddit.com/r/kolkata/comments/1jht9dg/3_day_itinerary_advicecriticism_please/,3 day itinerary - Advice/Criticism Please!,"Husband (first time) and I (second time, but first was mostly just office visit) are visiting over the Eid weekend.

We know it's going to be hot, but we are serial summer holidayers (mostly because leave from work is easy this time of year). We've done Hyderabad in April, Udaipur in June, and we live in Mumbai, so we can handle the heat (or at least, we think so).

We're living off Sudder St. Here's our plan:

1. Arrive Friday afternoon, check in, head straight out for lunch. Place undecided; recommendations in the neighborhood are welcome

2. Head to the Indian musuem, walk down Chowringee Lane to the memorial, walk around the historic district. Q here - is it better to get a guide; we love heritage walks but most we found online look tailored for white tourists, and the last thing we want is some EIC gratitude commentary.

3. Go to Trincas for dinner. Was one of the few cultural things I did on my first trip, and I loved the energy.

4. Wake up, get some breakfast. I've seen high praise for Balwant Singh, but recommendations around Sudder Street are welcome. We love food, and love coffee.

5. Saturday post breakfast is wide open now. Recommendations on what to see are welcome. Or maybe we will just finish the historic maidan area, because am sure we can't do everything on Day 1.

6. Head to Park Circus at Iftar for biryani (beef, please). Current toss up between Royal Indian and Zam Zam; happy to hear more options. We are neutral on potatoes since neither of us come from a state with a biryani obsession :)

7. Post dinner, we may just do a long walk back home. We like to walk, and we think we've chosen the right neighborhood to stay in for that. Route recommendations welcome.

8. Early start on Sunday. We've booked a culture day tour to Achipur, since my husband is learning Mandarin, and the history overall is quite interesting. I expect we won't be back before lunch and will go straight to someplace like Blue Poppy to eat. Pork momo or other must try Hakka cuisine recommendations are welcome.

9. Sunday evening is also wide open. I expect we'll take a nap after the morning tour, and would love to hear city recommendations for Sunday evening/if it's worth just watching the sunset at Prinsep Ghat. Peter Cat is one dinner recommendation but since it's the night before Eid, we would love other non veg recommendations too!

10. Wake up on Eid morning, get ready for checkout. Our flight is at 9pm so we have nearly a full day, and don't want to waste it, so more recommendations welcome. We wanted to go to Hindustan Park and chill at one of the lake cafes so we can have a more relaxed time before our flight.

Other things on my mind:
1. Visiting Jorasanko Thakurbari. 
2. Scheduling a Sabyasachi store visit if only to see what fashion artifacts are on display. Don't intend to buy anything.
3. Figuring which museums are worth the while. There are so many!

And that's it. Thanks in advance for all your advice!",1,1742712255.0,kolkata,0,1.0,False
1jht8yo,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jht8yo/male_disenfranchised_grief_gaslighting/,Male - Disenfranchised Grief - Gaslighting,"34 Male,  I feel like I can't speak about what is on my mind, not really. Friends and family listen but they don't really hear what I am saying, and have grown tired of helping try to make sense of things.

I am hurting really bad and feel like I am screaming internally all the time.

So here is the story, I met this girl 14 years ago in University. It was love at first sight on my end. We had lots of little coffee dates, and walks in the parks, and around the city, but she soon got back together with her ex-boyfriend. Then broke up with him, than met another guy and eventually married him and had a child. Now this whole time I was still friends with her. When her marriage went south, she sought me out for support, eventually it grew into an affair with me. Then it stopped for no apparent reason. I did not question it, I assumed it was bad timing, she mentioned she was going to try counselling with her husband, so I backed off. Next thing I know she is dating someone and I was left very confused. But, again I decided it was just bad timing and the situation being so complex, I did not want to admit her bad nature. 

Several years passed with me now being held at arms length, she made it clear she did not want messages from me. I respected her wishes for the most part, never calling her or sending her more than a ""happy birthday"". During this time she left that guy and found another who became husband number 2, which she had a second child with. 

Fast forward to the fall of 2024, I receive a message from her, completely unprompted she informs me that marriage number 2 is ending. Now, I am older and wiser at this point, but as it turns out still completely stupid where this woman is involved. I ask her motivation for telling me this, she replies that she is just looking for friendship and support, and that she is not looking for anything romantic *""RIGHT NOW"" (yes she actually said that)*. I acknowledge this as it makes sense, but I also make sure she understands I still have feelings for her. She confirms that she understands and says that she is not uncomfortable with me having told her that. So we begin talking, a lot *(nearly everyday)*. I start to help her understand certain elements of what she is going through *(IPV)* as it is very much related to my education. I help provide contact information for various resources and legal information for the divorce and possible custody battle over her second child. I even help with some advertising for her business. I feel I was being a true friend and support, because that is what she said she needed *RIGHT NOW*. Then the week of Valentines Day rolls around, I had this whole plan in my head for doing something small (not a date or anything) as I did not think she was at the point of starting anything new. At this point she reveals that she is going on a date Valentines weekend. As you may imagine given everything you just read this triggers me. I told her I was not aware she had started dating yet. She says that she thinks it is time and it can be just a *""fun casual thing, nothing serious""*. Well at this point I can't help but feel hurt, so I explain that this information has really caught me off guard due to my feelings for her and how much we've been chatting. Que the gaslighting, she tells me she had no idea I felt that way about her, and dismisses me when I show her a screenshot of me disclosing those feelings back in October.

Since our first date he's actively pursued me and tells me he likes me. Our first date was early Feb, and we went out twice before I left the country for a two week trip to europe. During the trip he asked if I wanted to meet him in Rome, b/c he had a layover there on his way to Brazil. I couldn't make it work but ended up coming back home a little early and we were able to see each other in the two days we overlapped before his Brazil trip. I told him I didn't want to have sex yet because he's going away for a while and we should just pick it up when he's back. He kept in moderate touch while he was away, checking in every few days and sending me pics. Before he came back he set up a date for a jazz night in my neighborhood. We went, it was really romantic and sweet, and when we got back he wanted to have sex. I told him 1) i was on day 4 so I couldn't but 2) I also feel uncomfortable with sleeping people who are seeing / sleeping with others. I told him I didn't want to put any pressure on the situation b/c I'm happy with the cadence and pace we have going, but it's just not a casual thing for me. He didn't say anything other than okay which made me think he either didn't understand what I was getting at or he is in fact seeing/sleeping with others. We endedup talkingabout our relationship history and he explained he had ended an engagement last april. i explained my concern that maybe there would be some misalignment in what we want from dating and he said while he isnt urgently waking up looking for a wife, he knows theres someone better for him out there. he said i'm not a casual person either i like you and asked if i wanted him stay over. he stayed over and told me i really like spending time with you. in the morning we had coffee and he left. i didn't really hear from him other than an instagram DM where he sent me a story from the coffee shop next door. i said i go every day and he wrote looks yummy we'll need to go there :). i said it's the best coffee in the city after yours. that was on friday afternoon and it's not sunday and i haevnt heard from him. i should note that we hung out Thursday. Where I live Thursday is the end of the work week and Sunday is the start of the work week. 

I'm left confused - is he still interested? Should I be reaching out to him to propose a date? Thursday was our 5th date.

1jht7te,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1jht7te/traveled_with_food_allergies_and_some_things_i/,Traveled with food allergies and some things I noticed,"I am anaphylactic to all nuts, shellfish/seafood, and eggs. I visited late February and stayed in Koto City but traveled through Tokyo and Chiba. I traveled alone but I met up with friends and was with them mostly. Just wanted to share a little about my experience- it was very limited trip so I’m not a perfect resource, but I was really worried beforehand and couldn’t find any stories and such about it so I’m writing it here. 


Initially I didn’t plan on going to any restaurants, but my friends took me to Yakiniku (in Chiba) after searching for a safe place. As long as you ask for the meat to not be marinated beforehand it’s pretty safe. I also didn’t dip mine in the sauce trays they provided, but I wasn’t sure what was in them anyway lol. There were no allergen labels on the menu, but they only had beef + chicken and no fish, so I only had to worry about sauces. It was crazy good. 


I also went to my hotel’s restaurant. I had wagyuu beef- the menu had a clear allergen warning and the staff also double checked that I knew they couldn’t guarantee a safe meal, but they were very kind and kinda hovered nearby as I was eating too. The menu had labels in both English and Japanese as well as little icons for extra measure next to each item. I also saw the stoves and kitchen in the back, and it was very spaced out so I didn’t worry too much about cross contamination this time. Honestly it was kind of risky for me to try it but it was really good.


I went to a karaoke cafe as well in Ikebukuro which also had its own allergen menu online. Thankfully everything that I was going for on the collaboration menu had nothing I was allergic to, however the cafe’s normal menu did have items I was allergic to. Because of cross contamination I was careful, but I only ate fries anyway.


Some other things to note.
- Spam was a life saver. As well as fruit, protein yogurt, and those little energy jelly packs.
- Pretty much all of the chips + snacks you see will have a “manufactured in a facility” or a “may contain” label. Even Pringles was a NG. It was mostly with shellfish. If your tolerance is higher than mine you’ll probably be fine.
- I looked at the ham and cheese sandwiches at the conbini, but they were labeled as containing eggs. I’m pretty sure this was because of the bread. I can eat bread if it’s heavily processed, but I wasn’t sure how fresh it was so I passed.
- If you’re looking at prepackaged cake and have an egg allergy, make sure the cream isn’t meringue or custard, which was common. 
- Packaged deli meat was also a NG. I looked at turkey and ham and again, the manufactured in a facility label for shellfish.
- Naturally the vending machines did not have any labels, but it was mostly for drinks anyway. With my nut allergy I avoid coffee unless I’ve made it myself, so I only got water from them. 
- My hotel’s shampoo and hand soap didn’t have labels on it. Bring your own shampoo + even your own hand soap. 
- A lot of places, especially those that “cater” to tourists, have allergen menus. I saw more allergen menus in Japan than I do at home. Even so you still need to be weary of cross contamination and derivatives. Absolutely avoid soups, broths, and sauces. 


Double check with your airline as well! On my flight back, I was allergic to literally everything on the menu and couldn’t do anything about it. I flew with Delta, and you can only make an accommodation for one allergy on their site beforehand, otherwise you need to call and go through a hassle to get everything listed. I wasn’t aware of that until my flight back. (My first flight’s menu to Japan was fine, but I slept the entire time so I didn’t eat anyway.)


Overall, shellfish was the most troublesome allergy. I was pretty shocked that the chips I was looking forward to trying may have contained eggs. It’s pretty possible to navigate with allergies but be prepared for extra preparation and settling with smaller meals.


EDIT: I recommend finding a hotel or place with a kitchenette if you have a longer stay, you’ll have more options if you go to the grocery store. Also bring some plastic silverware and a container, it was useful. ",6,1742712054.0,JapanTravelTips,2,0.75,False
1jht7kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1jht7kj/how_to_design_a_unique_custom_made_bobble_head/,How to Design a Unique Custom Made Bobble Head for Any Occasion,"Looking for a gift that’s fun, personal, and guaranteed to spark a smile? A custom bobble head could be your answer. Whether you're celebrating a birthday, commemorating a milestone, or just want to surprise someone with something quirky and creative, designing a custom bobble head adds a thoughtful and entertaining twist. These mini-statues are more than just fun desk toys — they’re tiny tributes packed with personality.

# 1. Start with the Occasion in Mind

The first step in creating a memorable bobble head is identifying the occasion. Is it a wedding, graduation, retirement, or a birthday? This will help shape the theme, attire, pose, and overall vibe of your bobble head. For example, if it’s a wedding gift, you might go for formal attire and a romantic pose. For a sports achievement, a bobble head in a team uniform mid-action can perfectly capture the moment.

# 2. Capture the Personality

A great custom bobble head isn’t just a lookalike; it’s a personality snapshot. Think about the traits that make the recipient unique. Are they always laughing, wearing sunglasses, or sipping on coffee? Include those elements in the design. Little details like facial expressions, accessories, and posture bring the bobble head to life and make it feel truly personal.

# 3. Get Creative with Themes and Props

Themes add a layer of fun and creativity. A superhero version of your best friend, a chef version of your dad, or a DJ version of your sister — the possibilities are endless. Props like instruments, pets, cars, or even fantasy elements can elevate the design and make it stand out. Think outside the box and use your imagination!

# 4. Choose the Right Pose and Outfit

The pose sets the tone. You can go for casual, silly, formal, or action-packed stances. Pair it with an outfit that either matches the occasion or reflects the person's style. If it’s a gift for someone who loves fashion, a trendy outfit is a must. If it’s for a professional milestone, a business suit or uniform might be the way to go.

# 5. Pay Attention to Facial Features

Facial accuracy is key in making a bobble head feel custom. Focus on distinct features — whether it's a big smile, unique hairstyle, glasses, or a signature beard. A good likeness adds that “wow” factor when the recipient realizes the bobble head is actually *them* in mini form.

Designing a **custom made bobble head** is not just about creating a gift — it’s about telling a story in a playful and tangible way. With the right attention to detail and a bit of imagination, you can turn any occasion into a memorable one. So go ahead, bring your ideas to life and make someone’s day with a head that wobbles and a heart that smiles.",1,1742712024.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

# 🎧 Стража! Стража! / Guards! Guards! - 5838 notes

Source: Guards! Guards! by Terry Pratchett, read by Nigel Planer and Дмитрий Игнатьев aka Digig (sound design - WhiteWoolf).

*«Двенадцать часов ночи, и все спокойно!» – таков девиз Ночной Стражи Анк-Морпорка, самого славного города на всем Плоском мире. А если «не все» спокойно, значит, вы просто ходите не по тем улицам.*

*А вообще, чтобы стать настоящим ночным стражником, нужно приложить немало усилий. Во-первых, следует научиться бегать не слишком быстро – а то вдруг догонишь! Во-вторых, требуется постичь основной принцип выживания в жестоких схватках – просто не участвуйте в таковых. В-третьих, не слишком громко кричите, что «все спокойно», – вас могут услышать.*

*Книга, которую вы держите в руках, поистине уникальна. Она поможет вам не только постичь основные принципы выживания в этом жестоком, суровом мире, но и сделать достойную карьеру. Пусть даже ночного стражника…*

**Why This Pick?**

3 of the last 4 encounters between these two squads have fallen Under 210 points; I think this meeting will follow suit. The Miami Heat have put less than 100 points on the board in 4 of their last 5 outings, while the Hornets haven’t bagged more than 106 points in 3 of their last 4. Lastly, the Hornets are notoriously abysmal on the road with a 7-27 away record. My money is undoubtedly on the Under to cash here, friends.

Naturally, I said this wasn't Betty's number, but I too was concerned now for Betty and hoped she got in touch with her mom. The person replied back that it must be Betty's number, and I'm mistaken. I asked for the number they were trying to reach.

They replied that they made a mistake, were sorry, and invited me for a coffee in San Francisco. 

It was at this point I began to think this was either a scam, or an elderly person. I replied that it was a nice gesture, and wished them good luck getting in touch with Betty, but I'm not even close to San Francisco. And it should have been apparent to them if they just googled my area code.

They said the offer for coffee still stood whenever I'm in town, and the person's name is Lina. Google brought me to this sub, apparently bots using the names Mandy or Lisa do similar things.

They haven't contacted me since, but am I in the midst of a scam sprouting up on my phone now? More importantly, how can I send Betty (or her mom) my recent tax refund...or is emptying my 401k the proper thing these days?

I threw a coin flip at Furina for the third time in a row, and for the first time, I won, welcome home Furina. It may be because I haven’t had the time to really finish leveling her up yet but she doesn’t feel like the upgrade to Xingqiu in my Yelan teams that I was hoping for. 

With regard to future pulls, Varesa definitely. Going to wait to see who’s coming up next to make my final decision but I may be going for her weapon as well. 


[\[HSR\]](https://imgur.com/9DeAejP)

Hate this fucking game dog. This has always been my policy, implicitly, but I want to have it written down. If the characters I have right now aren’t enough to comfortably full star every endgame mode, I don’t care any more. I do not care about the meta for this game any more. I am logging in solely to take the money and run at this point. Ampharos is a lost fucking cause. Despite being so much more boring and predictable than Penacony, it still tries to fucking juke me sometimes. Oh Oronyx is dead now that thing that happened off screen, it killed the titan and now they’re dead. You need someone in the story to explain what happened to you in the story because these mfs think they’re making a Tarantino movie and it being incomprehensible on your first experience of the narrative is a mark of quality. I’m not playing your fucking mid story a second time on an alt account just so I can understand it. This game is such a sequel to HI3 and I can feel it in its DNA in that respect. 

People have been complaining about the lack of events but frankly that’s one of the only things keeping me logging in to this ass game. If I had to play it more than I already do (which is 10 minutes per day auto battling to spend my resin while I alt tab out and watch youtube videos while drinking my morning coffee) it would feel like a deeply unwelcome intrusion. If my currency looks a bit low it might be because I haven’t even touched this patch’s flagship event yet, I’m really putting that mf off as long as I can. 

Who am I saving for, I have no idea. At this point it’s looking like a save until the next X.0 situation. 

HSR sections might start getting shorter from this month on.

[\[ZZZ\]](https://imgur.com/G8fEbdp) 

Now fun game. ZZZ is the game I find that I am looking forward to new story content the most nowadays. The new main story is amazing, and it manages to be good with just good old fashioned melodrama. I love Hugo as a villain and I’m surprised that they would make such a flawed character nowadays. I know he’s going to get some kind of a redemption arc but I hope they use a light touch with it. He ultimately has sympathetic motivations.

My wishes went down because I threw a 50/50 on Qingyi on the banner before, and I’m honestly glad that I lost, that was probably a mistake. So I’m on a guarantee, and I am definitely, 100% spending that on Vivian. Never really liked Anby that much but her story was a pleasure to play though even if it did revert to the status quo a little bit too conveniently at the end. I like Trigger’s design but her personality seems a bit flat so I might have to wait until she gets her story quest before I can make a judgment on her. Even if I do end up getting her it’s looking like it’s going to be on her rerun, which is tragic, another stunner added to the “pull on her rerun” pile. Realistically with how fast powercreep is going, this does not feel like a game where you ever pull on reruns.

I also spent a bunch of pulls on weapon banner trying my luck at an early Burnice weapon. She’s one of my most used characters so I figured it would be a good investment, but I stopped myself before I would have started hitting pity. Ultimately Weeping Gemini is good enough for the purposes in which I usually use her, and that is as an off field DPS in an anomaly team with lots of disorders and very little stuns.",1,1742710594.0,u_ophir147,0,1.0,False

1jhsvh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpeaklikekaminiIELTS/comments/1jhsvh6/how_to_ace_ielts_speaking_part_1_topics_tips/,"How to Ace IELTS Speaking Part 1: Topics, Tips & Sample Answers","If you’re preparing for the **IELTS Speaking test**, Part 1 is the easiest section — but that doesn’t mean you should take it lightly! This part lasts **4–5 minutes**, and the examiner will ask simple, personal questions about everyday topics.

It sounds easy, right? But here’s the catch: You need to **sound natural, confident, and fluent** to score well. So, let’s break it down:

# What Kind of Questions Will You Get?

The examiner will ask about familiar topics — things you talk about in daily life. Here are some common categories:

# 1. Personal Life & Background

* Where are you from?
* What do you do — work or study?
* Can you describe your home?

Example:  
**Q:** Where is your hometown?  
**A:** *I’m from Barcelona, a beautiful city in Spain. It’s famous for its architecture, beaches, and delicious food. I love living there because there’s always something happening!*

# 2. Hobbies & Interests

* Do you like reading?
* What kind of music do you listen to?
* Do you enjoy playing sports?

Example:  
**Q:** Do you like listening to music?  
**A:** *Yes, absolutely! I listen to music every day. I love pop music, especially Ed Sheeran’s songs. His lyrics are really meaningful, and his voice is so calming.*

# 3. Daily Routines & Habits

* What’s your morning routine like?
* Do you prefer eating at home or in restaurants?
* How do you usually spend your weekends?

Example:  
**Q:** What do you do on weekends?  
**A:** *On weekends, I usually sleep in a bit, then meet up with my friends. We like to go for coffee or watch a movie. I also try to do some exercise, like jogging in the park.*

# 4. Technology & Social Media

* How often do you use your phone?
* Do you prefer texting or calling?
* What’s your favorite social media platform?

Example:  
**Q:** Do you use social media a lot?  
**A:** *Yes, probably too much! I use Instagram the most because I love looking at travel photos and funny videos. But I try not to spend too much time on my phone.*

# How to Prepare for IELTS Speaking Part 1

# 1. Don’t Just Say “Yes” or “No”

Give more details! Imagine you’re having a friendly chat. Instead of:  
**Q:** Do you like shopping? → *Yes, I do.*  
Say: *Yes, I enjoy shopping, especially for clothes. I like exploring different stores and finding good deals.*

# 2. Keep It Natural & Simple

You don’t need fancy vocabulary or complex grammar. Just speak clearly and confidently.

**Wrong approach:** *Shopping is an activity that I engage in frequently because it provides an opportunity to obtain necessary commodities.*  
**Better:** *I like shopping, especially when I find great discounts. It’s fun to buy new clothes and try different styles.*

# 3. Use Personal Examples

If you’re stuck, think of a **real-life example** to make your answer more natural.

**Q:** Do you like reading?  
*Yes, books are good.*  
*Yes! I love mystery novels. My favorite book is ‘Sherlock Holmes’ because I enjoy solving mysteries while I read.*

# 4. Practice Speaking Out Loud

* Talk to yourself in English
* Record your answers and listen back
* Practice with a friend or tutor

The goal is **fluency**, not perfection. The more you practice, the more confident you’ll feel!

# Final Thoughts

IELTS Speaking Part 1 is just a casual chat! Relax, smile, and **treat it like a normal conversation.** Remember these tips:

Give **detailed answers** (not just “yes” or “no”)

Keep it **natural and simple**

Use **real-life examples**

Speak **confidently and fluently**

Now, let’s practice! **Pick a question from above and answer it in the comments!**
