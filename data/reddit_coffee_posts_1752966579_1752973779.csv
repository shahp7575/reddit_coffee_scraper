Honey Niki {50 female} the writer of this story

Rj {53 male} My husband 

Nicklaus John {47 male} my brother

Sheila B {68 female} my mother 

Duster {48 male} my brother who is homeless

I am currently have a serious problem from my family since l can always remember.  If anyone wants to know please say something and l will gladly write depending on the responds on this story.

in Jan 2022 I had  2 milestone birthdays Rj who was turning 50 years and Sheila B. who was turning 65 years old. So l started  to get ahold of Nicklaus John to plan Sheila B. 65th birthday.  Me and Nicklaus John wanted to see a  baseball game while we visit. So the plan was neither going to Philadelphia or coming to Tucson. So while me and Nicklaus John trying to figure out the baseball game to go. Nicklaus John found out the Philadelphia Phillies and the Arizona Diamondbacks on the week of Sheila  B  actually birthday. I felt it was  great and I was very excited with idea. I love the Philadelphia Phillies and Me and Sheila B. Live in Arizona. I felt it was fate for us to go Philly I would get to spend with some more with  the family.  I wish this plan would happen. Nicklaus John called Sheila B. he asked her if me and Sheila B could come to Philly to  celebrate her 65th Birthday. Also Me and Nicklaus John can go to the baseball game. Nicklaus John told her it was the Phillies and Diamondbacks were playing. Nicklaus John told Sheila B. it was fate for the baseball game. Sheila B. said let her think about it. Me and Sheila B. trying to figure out a plan for her 65th Birthday plans. I told her my heart was set on Philly I haven't seen some of the family for over 10 years. Sheila B. problem with going with the Philly plan is her one Kitty. Now I don't understand this reason. Sheila B. had other people check up on her Kitty and Sheila B had me watch both Kitties already so I didn't get it. I let it go and said fine. I know it is Sheila B. 65th Birthday. Sheila B. has a right and say what happens for her Birthday. Including Rj wasn't aloud to  be apart  for her birthday.

I also had to plan Rj milestone Birthday. I had  a really had the greatest Birthday present. My planned for Rj 50th Birthday was spending  the Day of his 50th. No cake No nothing just spend the time with me. Now the next day was Rj and l were suppose go to the Olive Garden. Rj was  gonna received the best Birthday gift ever given. The greatest birthday fell apart 2 weeks before hiss birthday. To make matters worse Rj went to the hospital for CHF a  couple days before his 50th Birthday. I will get to more in the story depending on the FANS. Trust me there is more. 

Now back to Sheila B. Birthday plans. Sheila B. wanted to  celebrate her in between Mother Day and  June. Sheila B. let me know  what teams were coming to Arizona. I picked the Dodger game. So now it was time to set my vacation time off  to my job. I took the week off for Rj Birthday was in April and Sheila B. was in May 2022. Trust me none of those weeks was a vacation. I would had a better time in HELL than what happen to me.

For Starters Rj 50th Birthday gift fell apart 2 weeks before his gift was suppose to appear and Rj went to the Hospital right before he turn 50 years old. To put the cherry on top. I found out while I was gone for the week of RJ birthday 1 of my friends pass away that I worked with it. Now after this  Sheila B. went into full Queen Karen mode. She got rid of living room furniture and mine as well. Nothing wrong with the old living room furniture but  again it is Sheila B. house. Than Sheila B. had hire people to clean the carpets. Now Sheila B. own a carpet cleaner and we  could saved money there. Again it is Sheila  B house. Sheila B also inform me that Nicklaus John will doing repairs around her house as well while visiting us. I was thinking Nicklaus John is suppose to be on vacation not being Sheila B handy man.

Day 1 Nicklaus John came to Tucson. Everything was  fine. Me Nicklaus John and Sheila B we were talking about the past most of the past was very sad. No one got upset everything went great that evening.   

Day 2 I woke up and started to make my coffee. Talk to Sheila B on the back patio. Sheila B was smoking and she mention her errands she was doing. I said goodbye to Sheila B. After Sheila B left her spot than I decided to sit in the same spot as Sheila B  and started to smoke as well while my coffee was brewing. Nicklaus John was on the roof working on something on Sheila B roof. Out of no where Nicklaus John ran down started yelling at me about the dangers of smoking and how I am trying to kill him while I was smoking. I am looking at him WTF are you doing. Sheila B was at the same spot and she was smoking as well and he didn't talk to Sheila B that way at all. Than Sheila B. came home  and Nicklaus John was walking back and forth on the back patio acting stupid to play the victim in all this. Told Sheila B. I prevented him from doing work on the roof because of me smoking. Of course Sheila B took Nicklaus John side. I am like whatever and what else is new. This Nicklaus John acting like a little spoil brat baby. After dinner  Nicklaus John start to insult me about my job. I am at the time working at grocery store cashier. Which I am happy to work at. I love being a cashier and interacting with customers. He told me a 14 year old can do my job. It took me a minute to inform Nicklaus John a 14 year old couldn't do my job. You have be 21 years or older to do my job because of booze sales. After a while with us arguing I told him his anger isn't with me. I inform Nicklaus John his anger is with Duster. Who is homeless no job and goals so please stop attacking me being a cashier. At least I have a job that l am good at and very happy to do. Nicklaus John told me people aren't happy being a cashier and l need to find a different job. I told Nicklaus John No I am very happy with my job end of story.

Day 3 Really bad day for me. Nicklaus John ask me if I wanted to see Rj because Nicklaus John also told me he wanted to see Rj as well. I was very happy at that moment I said sure. Nicklaus John told Sheila B I wanted to see Rj. instead of telling Sheila B the truth he wanted to see his BIL Rj. Knowing how Sheila B feels about Rj. Sheila B made a face of evil to me that bought tears and fears after Nicklaus John. Also I need a Diamondback shirt for the baseball game and Nicklaus John said he would buy the shirt as a gift.  So we got back to get ready for Sheila B birthday dinner that turn into a  nightmare of HELL. We get to restaurant of Sheila B. choosing . Nicklaus John started again with his uncomfortable questions and remarks. Like what were my plans were when Sheila B passes away what am l gonna do about her house and he was glad that Rj and I didn't  have any children. We would be FUCKED UP PARENTS.  Now mind you I suffered 4 miscarriages. Yes I had a meltdown at this point. Guess what Sheila B do nothing. She always  over look what Nicklaus John Statement and his actions. At the end of dinner I got blamed for ruining dinner. I am like what else is new.

I am a 29 year old female with a current ADHD diagnosis and an autism assessment scheduled for later this month. I've been reading about autism in-depth and find myself struggling to relate to certain aspects of this experience. 

In particular, I am disturbed by my severe lack of desire to socialize with others. My father used to jokingly refer to me as a ""misanthrope"" growing up, because I never had any desire to be around others. I found most people unlikeable (because I got bullied a lot) and was generally distrustful of people's true intentions. 

I have a **\*very\*** small, selective safe group of people I love socializing with and do not have any desire to meet new people at all. Even with particular hyper-fixations or special interests of mine, I have absolutely **0 desire** to attend any conventions, concerts, conferences, clubs, support groups, etc. 

My other neurodivergent friends still love meeting new people even if they lean towards being introverted, like I am. They'll happily attend a slam poetry event at a local coffee shop or go to a meet-up of people that all share a particular interest. They'll willing attend farmer's markets or the renaissance faire. Even if I go \*with\* my loved ones, I'm easily exhausted, uncomfortable, bored, and on-edge most of the time. 

I was once apart of a DND group with a mix of autistic & ADHD folks and I found the frequency of their meet-ups and the prolonged DND sessions to be exhausting. Which is, by the way, NOT their fault. I truly find my behavior odd and deeply concerning. Even something as simple as a visit to the beach feels tedious, overwhelming, and scary. 

I have never, ever, EVER desired to go to an event/party/conference/etc. and meet others. Even my other neurodivergent friends seem taken aback (understandably so) by my complete lack of desire or motivation to go out and do things in public places. I will only attend an event if I am absolutely forced to go or if it is to make someone I love happy (in which case I will mask the entire time). Is this a feature of the ADHD and or Autism experience, or am I dealing with something totally out there??? ",2,1752972942.0,AutisticWithADHD,0,1.0,False

*After Eren and Mikasa died, they were reborn in the future and began living peaceful lives again. However, unlike before, they never met each other in this new life—until their first day at college.*

**Chapter 03** :- *A night out with friends*

**(Mikasa's POV)**

Wind shrieked in my ears as I stood atop a monstrous, feathered beast, its wings slicing through clouds of steam. The world below was a blur of smoke and ruin. Someone stood beside me—their face smudged into shadows by my dreaming mind.

My hands clenched two bloodied swords, their weight familiar yet foreign. Ahead, two colossal figures clashed, their roars shaking the sky.

**""Now.""** A voice I knew but couldn't place.

Then—I was moving.

A strange device on my hips propelled me forward against my will, hurtling me toward the titans. One of them had a gaping hole in its mouth, and inside—

A head.

A person, half-merged with flesh. Their features were blurred, but my body reacted before my mind could. The swords rose—

Suddenly I woke up from my bed. What a wierd dream.

Gasping, I kicked off my sweat-drenched sheets, the digital clock glaring: 8:00 PM.
**""Shit—the meetup!""**

Sasha's voice echoed in my memory: **""Don't forget!""**


**(Armin's POV - Before Mikasa Arrives)**

The living room hummed with our usual pre-meetup chaos. Sasha had already raided my snack cabinet, her cheeks stuffed like a chipmunk's.  

**""Armin, your pantry is a war crime,""** she mumbled through a mouthful of crackers. **""Where's the actual food?""**  

Connie tossed a carrot at her head. **""Eat a vegetable for once, you trash panda.""**  

Reiner scrolled through his phone, occasionally grunting at memes. Christa and Ymir were tangled together on the loveseat, whispering about some new anime. Bertholdt nursed a soda in the corner, half-asleep as usual.  

I checked the clock. **8:17 PM.**  

**""Where's Mikasa?""** Annie asked, kicking her feet up on my coffee table. **""She's never late.""**  

**""Maybe she finally snapped and murdered someone,""** Connie offered helpfully.  


**(Mikasa's POV)**

The evening air cooled my flushed face as I power-walked through Shiganshina's streets. That dream—those *swords*—clung to my muscles like phantom weight.  

**Why did it feel so real?**  

My phone buzzed. Armin: **""R u dead?""**  

I typed back: **""Be there in 5. Save me food.""**  


**(Armin's POV - Mikasa's Arrival)**

The doorbell finally rang.  

**""Look alive, people,""** I announced. ""The Ackerman has graced us.""  

Mikasa stood in the doorway, slightly out of breath. Her hair was damp at the ends—she'd clearly rushed through a shower.  

**""Sorry I'm late,""** she said, stepping inside. **""I was... tired. Fell asleep.""**  

Sasha immediately pounced. **""Ooooh, tired from what~?""**

Mikasa's deadpan stare could've frozen lava. **""From existing, Sasha.""**

I nudged her as she passed me. **""You good? You look like you saw a ghost.""**

She hesitated just half a second too long. **""Just a weird dream. Where's the food?"" **


**(Connie's POV)**

After Mikasa arrived, we all settled into our usual meetup routine - chatting, playing some games, just enjoying each other's company. Eventually, me, Armin, and Mikasa ended up sitting around the coffee table while others scattered around the room.  

That's when I noticed it.  

Armin was staring somewhere with that spaced-out look he gets when overthinking. I followed his gaze and—oh. Annie. And was he... blushing?  

Well well well.

I nudged Mikasa beside me and pointed subtly at Armin. She caught on immediately.  

**""Oh?""** Mikasa said, her voice laced with amusement. **""Looks like someone's simping for someone at this moment. Right, Connie?""**

I grinned. **""Oh yes. And I definitely know who that someone is.""**  

Armin's head snapped toward us, his face turning scarlet. **""G-guys, you're not making fun of me, right?""**

I couldn't resist. **""Yeah, we're definitely having fun with you.""**

Mikasa sipped her drink calmly while I continued. **""Look man, staring at her won't be enough to make anything happen. If you want to take the next step, just talk to her.""** 

Armin crossed his arms, defensive. **""Why would I talk to her about it? I'm not in love with her.""**

He tried to brush it off, but I noticed Mikasa's expression shift. Where I was just teasing, she seemed... thoughtful. Maybe even serious about what I'd said.  

The clock ticked past midnight before any of us noticed.  

Sasha was half-asleep on the couch, crumbs still clinging to her shirt. Reiner kept yawning every thirty seconds like a malfunctioning alarm. Even Annie—who usually outlasted us all—was blinking slower than normal.  

**""Alright, party's over,""** Armin announced, though he was smiling as he said it.  

One by one, we gathered our stuff. Christa and Ymir left first. Bertholdt practically carried a snoring Sasha over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes.  

**""Someone text me when you get home,""** Mikasa told each of us in that mom-friend tone of hers.  

I lingered by the doorway, watching Armin and Annie have one of their weird silent conversations—just intense eye contact and micro-expressions.  

**Still denying it, huh?**  

Mikasa nudged me. **""Leave the lovebirds alone.""**  

**""Never,""** I grinned, but let her push me out into the cool night air.  

The walk home was quiet, the kind of comfortable silence that only comes after a really good day. Above us, the stars looked brighter than usual.  

**Same time next week?** Reiner's text buzzed in my pocket.  

I smiled. Obviously.


**(Mikasa's POV)**

The walk home felt longer than usual, my legs heavy with exhaustion. Streetlights flickered overhead as I dragged myself into the apartment building, the elevator's hum the only sound in the sleepy stillness.  

Then—movement.  

At the far end of the hallway, two doors down from mine, a figure fumbled with keys. The dim lighting caught familiar broad shoulders, that messy dark hair—  

My breath hitched.  

**No. Freaking. Way.**

Eren Yeager stood in my hallway, shoving a stubborn key into a stubborn lock. Our eyes met for one electric second before his door finally gave way. He disappeared inside without a word.  

**""Hey,""** I whispered-yelled to Mrs. Vogel, my elderly neighbor who lived between us. She was peeking through her usual crack in the door. **""What's he doing here?""** 

**""Oh, the handsome young man?""** She smiled, adjusting her glasses. **""Moved in this afternoon. Seems quiet—carried up boxes of books instead of beer like the last tenant.""**  

Great. Just what I needed. The human equivalent of a thunderstorm now lived twenty feet from my bedroom.  

I slammed my door harder than necessary, the sound echoing through the thin walls. After a scalding shower that did nothing to wash away the day's frustrations, I collapsed onto my bed.  

My phone buzzed—a text from an unknown number:  

**Unknown: Hey...how are you?**  

For half a second, my traitorous heart whispered Jean before logic kicked in. Too tired to care, I chucked the phone onto my nightstand. Morning-Me could deal with mysterious texts and nightmare neighbors.  

As I drifted off, the last thing I heard was Eren's muffled music through the wall—some angry guitar riff that perfectly matched my mood.

## Key Features Analysis

The efficacy of a stain remover depends on a variety of factors, including its formulation, request method, and the types of stains it targets. Let's delve into the technical specifications that set these ""Grandma Stain Removers"" apart.

**Enzyme Blend:** Many of the leading stain removers utilize a proprietary blend of enzymes specifically designed to break down various stain types. These enzymes target proteins, starches, fats, and other organic compounds that commonly make up stubborn stains. The effectiveness of the enzyme blend depends on its concentration, the specific enzymes included, and their ability to function effectively at different temperatures and pH levels.

many grandma stain removers boast a powerful blend of enzymes that breaks down stains at the molecular level. This includes protease for protein-based stains like blood and dairy, amylase for starch-based stains like food spills, and lipase for grease and oil stains. The higher the concentration of these enzymes, generally, the more effective the stain remover.

**Surfactant Technology:** Surfactants play a crucial role in stain removal by lowering the surface tension of water, allowing it to penetrate fabric fibers more effectively. They also help to lift stains away from the material and keep them suspended in the water, preventing them from redepositing back onto the fabric. The type and concentration of surfactants used can substantially impact the product's overall cleaning power.

Good surfactants lift and trap stain molecules, enabling them to be washed away. Stain removers with a blend of non-ionic and anionic surfactants are often more effective for a wider range of stains. Some formulations might also include amphoteric surfactants for improved performance in hard water.

**pH Level:** The pH level of a stain remover can influence its effectiveness on different types of stains and fabrics. Acidic stain removers are generally better for removing tannin-based stains like coffee and tea, while alkaline stain removers are more effective on grease and oil. A neutral pH is frequently enough preferred for delicate fabrics to prevent damage.

The optimal pH level will depend on the type of stain being tackled.

**Can Grandma stain removers be used on all types of fabrics?**
While most ""Grandma Stain Removers"" are formulated to be safe for a wide range of fabrics, it's always recommended to test the product on an inconspicuous area first. Delicate fabrics like silk, wool, and linen may require special care, and some stain removers may be too harsh for these materials.check the product label for specific fabric recommendations.

**How long should I let the stain remover sit on the stain before washing?**
The recommended dwell time can vary depending on the product and the severity of the stain.In general, it's best to allow the stain remover to sit on the stain for at least 5-10 minutes before washing. For tough, set-in stains, you may need to let it sit for longer, up to an hour or even overnight. Always follow the instructions on the product label.**Are Grandma Stain Removers safe for use around children and pets?**

1m4btar,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1m4btar/im_so_heartbroken/,I’m so heartbroken,"

I was in a relationship with a girlfriend for about 7 months. We broke up back in March. After about 3 months of no contact, I ended up texting her. We spoke over the phone, and during that conversation, she told me I should’ve reached out sooner—unfortunately, she had started dating someone else and wanted to give it a real shot.
Fast forward a couple of months, I saw her pop up on Bumble, so I figured they must have broken up. I decided to message her, and she mentioned she was feeling sick. I offered to bring her some Gatorade and medicine, and she accepted. When I dropped it off, she gave me a tour of her new house and was very friendly.
A few days later, once she was feeling better, I asked her to grab coffee. She said yes, and we ended up having a great time—we even went to the movies. I went in for a kiss, but she pulled back and said, “Not yet,” which I totally understood. The next day, we hung out again. She brought up that it really upset her that I never introduced her to my daughters or made her feel like part of my family when we were together. I admitted I regretted that and told her I’d do things differently if we gave it another shot.
She told me she had broken up with the guy about two weeks earlier and went on Bumble out of frustration. She said she still had some feelings for both of us, to which I said I wasn’t interested in being in competition—I needed her to be sure. She replied that she probably wasn’t going back to him.
Later, we went to her place. She asked for a massage, took off her shirt, and lay face-down. After the massage, we lay in bed, and she ended up kissing me. About 20 minutes later, she said she needed to get up early, so I left.
The next day I texted her and suggested we catch a sunrise at one of our old spots. She said it wasn’t the best day for it and mentioned having a hair appointment. So I suggested going out on Friday instead, and she agreed. That was Monday.
Come Friday, I texted to see how her day was going. She replied after some delay, saying she was super stressed and wouldn’t be able to go out. Later that evening, she sent me a longer message apologizing, saying there’s just a lot of emotion and confusion and she was trying to figure out how to put it into words.
I told her to take her time and that when she was ready, she knew where to find me.
And now… nothing.
I’m honestly confused. Things felt like they were going in a good direction, and I don’t really know what went wrong. Anyone have insights or been through something similar?",1,1752972436.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I am so embarrassed.,"I graduated two months ago with my dream degree after four years at a school I loved, but I never took an internship for some reason, and I'm paying for it now. The only job in my new city that would even agree to interview me was a coffee shop that pays 15 an hour. I like the job fine, but it's so unfulfilling, and hardly pays the bills. Every day I wake up so embarrassed to go to work, and cry on my way. I know that I'm meant to do more with my life, but I'm worried I never will, or won't get the chance. Every second I'm not at work I'm developing my portfolio and looking for jobs, but there really isn't much out there, especially because I'm limited to one city for my partner's job. 

I'm so scared that this will be my reality forever, and I'll never crawl out of this. What if I'm suddenly 40 and never had a career? I hate that I'm always so stressed about everything. Everyone always said that life post-grad was amazing, but the last two months have been awful. I know that things are rough for recent grads right now, and I'm privileged to have a job and roof over my head at all, but I really wanted to do something more with my life. I don't know how to find purpose. 

I think the worst part is that I did this to myself. I have no idea why I didn't seek an internship, I feel so stupid. I don't know what I thought would happen. I don't want to sit around and blame everything else because I know that my situation is my fault alone, and I'm the only one that can fix it, but I don't know how when every job requires 2-5 years of experience and every internship will only take students. 

I'm sorry if this reads like the ravings of a madman, I don't have a therapist because therapy is expensive and I get paid 15 dollars an hour. ",3,1752972316.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1m4bpmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m4bpmg/have_we_met_before/,Have we met before?,"Hello again, or, is it just, hello? Have we met this time around? There are too many people to remember them all, so forgive me if I forget your name. I need your help, I don't know how I wound up in this situation but I seem to have been ground hog day'd. I have seen the world ending thousands of times and I need someone to help me.



It wasn't world ending apocalypses initially it started out with small things, I'd get hit by a car and die, so the next time round I would wait till the car went past, then cross the street. Just little things like that, after the first hundred or so times around though, things started to get a little more extreme, the first such example was a man with a knife who charged me and stabbed me to death, so I called the police ahead of time. They made it, stopped him from attacking me and hit me with a stray bullet when the knife man charged them. After that, I took a different route to the coffee shop. The first time I actually made it to the coffee shop a gas line exploded when I arrived and killed me, and, I assume everyone else there at the same time.



After that I decided to try and leave town, so I went to catch a train, which promptly derailed and took out everyone on the platform as it did so. The strange thing is though, that I checked the news while I was on the platform and the gas line didn't explode this time around.



That got me thinking, if bad things were only happening to kill me, what if I just stayed home and waited it out. Well, the only time I tried that I was the victim of a plane crash in my own livingroom. I decided that my best course of action was to wander the city for the day and do my best to be aware of my surroundings, and wouldn't you know it, it got me further than anything I'd tried so far, but ultimately failed when we were hit with a chemical weapon strike



At that point I came to the decision that I should stay away from crowds to minimize the casualties, the problem was that I didn't own a car, so my options were public transport or walk, and public transport hadn't treated me well today. I started walking first thing in the morning, by noon I was on the city outskirts with lifestyle blocks lining the highway. I made sure to stay well away from any vehicle that I saw on the road. That, of course, didn't stop the bombs from killing me. I turned around after the bright flash and, a couple seconds later, woke up back in my bed. The next few attempts I tried running, but for the first time, the exact cause of death repeated itself. That's when I realized that the only way to prevent an event was to be safely out of it's reach. I spent a few attempts trying to find the most accessible bike I could to “borrow”, after a few attempts I found that one of the bikes at the convenience store had been left unlocked. That time I made it to the next town over, turns out, they were quite earthquake prone. It took a few attempts, but I eventually found a safe spot to weather the earth quake.



The declaration of war came next several world leaders were assassinated all at once and everyone blamed everyone else, and then the missiles began to fly, and, surprise surprise, the first nuke hit the town in was in. Interestingly enough, if I didn't go to that town, the war didn't happen, I figured that since I was far enough from that first nuke that I didn't die immediately, then it had to be a different cause of death.



I had taken to keeping up with the news to try and avoid anything that seemed dangerous. I basically gave up when I saw that a virus had swept across more than half of the Continental United States in a matter of hours, leaving very few survivors in its wake. The experts were saying 97% of the population was dead within 5 minutes of first symptoms, and believe me, it was not a comfortable 5 minutes. After that I tried to break the loop myself a couple of times, if you catch my drift. That, evidently also didn't work. That's when I had an idea scuba gear should have enough oxygen for me to last at least the initial pass of the virus, and if the pattern holds, that meant that it wouldn't happen at all. I was right, I looked like an idiot in a stolen scuba mask, but I was right. That still didn't stop the meteor though, and that's where I've been stuck for the past few hundred days, 3.37pm, the world ends. And I don't know if there is any way, aside from breaking the time loop, to stop it. Which brings us to the reason I'm writing this now. I think I have figured out a way to break it. I've spent a few decades at this point studying mythology about time loops and I think I know which one I'm in.



Are you familiar with the concept of purgatory? Well, it's kind of like that, except, I'm not dead yet, and it's contagious. It's a punishment and once I have made amends and atoned for my sins, I believe I will be set free. It also turns out that, by sharing my knowledge I have spread the reach of this curse. Thank you all, for taking on a portion of my suffering and making penance for my sins.



If you want my advice, don't dodge the car, it hurts a lot less than the feeling of you lungs liquefying in you chest.

1m4bpke,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1m4bpke/relationship_ended_before_it_even_began/,Relationship ended before it even began,"I (31M) was introduced to a girl (27F) in Korea back in April of this year. She was born and raised there, while I immigrate to US 20 years ago. We were introduced by a mutual acquaintance of our respective fathers.  
  
At first things were going great, we tried to find this time of the day that worked for both of us to talk. We shared a lot of hobbies and interests, as well as sharing similar values in life and priorities. That last part was really winning me over. I’ve sent her a few digital coupons for iced coffees and teas, which she loved.  
  
But then her job had an organizational shift, and she essentially became the team lead, which made her insanely busy (without the added benefits or pay, but that’s beside the point). I tried to be as responsive as possible, but she usually took three or four days to respond.

Originally, I planned to take a vacation to Korea in October, if signs looked good and we kept in contact. But as communication wore down, I begin to have second thoughts; The initial excitement was gone, and I kept thinking and reflecting on whether this relationship can advance.

This dragged on for months. And ultimately I decided to call it off. Today, I sent her a long text explaining why this isn't gonna work out. Not gonna repeat everything, but it pretty much boils down to me explaining:

* I planned to visit Korea and meet up with her in October of this year. I was really into her and wanted to get to know her better
   * And if signs are there, I was gonna ask her to go official
* But I can see how busy she is with her job. And I feel she deserves a full rest over the weekends rather than talking some guy on the other side of the planet
* I understand this can happen to anyone, and it's beyond our control. And this is why even if I visited Korea, I don't know if she'll have time for me. And asking her to dedicate what little free time she has to meet up with me would be unfair to her.
* I've seen way too many cases where people started dating even though they were busy, and it usually ended with nasty break-ups w/ everyone hurting. And I wasn't gonna put her through that
* While she did told me she'd be free by March of next year, I personally didn't have willpower to wait until then, and us texting until then sounded like a terrible idea.
* Therefore, we should just go our separate ways. I wish her the best of luck, and know she'll find someone when the time is right.

She replied back a few hours later. To summarize:

* I never bothered or offended her in any way.
* She also felt horrible about those late responses
* Past few weeks, she was in tears because of her work, and she pretty much ignored every form of casual communication or conversations, not just me
* She is sorry if she made me feel hurt, and thanked me for all the supporting and kind words I've sent to her so far.

Before the big shake up at her work, we talked a lot and I genuinely thought things were going great. And now we are at this situation. It's also the first time I was the one who broke the bad news. I thought carefully what to say for a few days, kept re-re-rewriting it to make it sound genuine, then agonized on whether I should hit that ""send"" button for hours.

I have no idea how I feel about what he told me. I want to think it’s cute that he cared this much, but it’s just coming off as creepy and I feel lied to. 

He got drunk because we were celebrating my first successful day at my clinicals and he ended up saying something along the lines of “could you believe we wouldn’t be this happy if I hadn’t watched you for so long?” To which I was confused and didn’t know what he meant. Well I had worked at a local library for two years, before we met, during college and apparently he saw me there but didn’t actually  talk to me, he just would watch me and listen in on my conversations with the people I was checking out and my coworkers to figure out what I liked. Then he apparently followed me and found the coffee shop I frequented. 

All this time I thought we had a sweet first time meeting story. He accidentally bumped into me, apologized, and offered to buy me coffee for the trouble. He told me what he was ordering and it was the exact same thing I always get and I thought it was an amazing coincidence, I joked that it was fate and we spent like an hour talking over coffee. I feel so stupid. Apparently it was similar to a scene in a book that I had read and told my coworker I had thought was cute. 

I’m just so frustrated and angry. I feel betrayed, like why would you do this?? And how much of our year and a half relationship is a lie. Like it sounds like he was stalking me

*Edit: Just so we’re all on the same page, I don’t believe he was watching me the whole time I was working there, I think it was the last 6 months or so before I actually met him.*
*He is a bit socially awkward, but he has a group of friends that he plays D&D and hangs out with like once a week.*
*He’s 25 and I’m 22 so it’s not a weird age gap.*
*I have never really considered him going through my phone weird because I basically let anyone look at my phone whenever. I’m not worried about anyone seeing anything.*
*I’ve also never really been worried about my safety with him before, but I do know that he has anger issues and has gotten in trouble for getting into a few physical fights, so for those of you worried about me I will be watching for any signs I might have missed.*


*I mainly am just upset because I feel like our relationship was built on a lie, even if it was a smallish one. He also said he was interested in a lot of the same things I was when we first met and for a while he kept up with them, but lately he hasn’t at all and I’m now wondering if he lied about those things too.*

*I definitely need to have a conversation with him and I’m driving home now so I’ll talk with him when I get there. Thanks for the feedback folks*

**The following edit was made by my ex, but I’ll leave it here so you can see it** *edit: I was wrong. He has done nothing wrong.*

Hey everyone, I know a lot you have been worried about me and I just wanted to let all of you know that I’m safe. Shit has definitely hit the fan, but at the moment I’m safe. 

First, no I didn’t make that last edit. My boyfriend went on my phone while I was showering and trying to figure out what I wanted to say to him about everything and he found and edited my post. He then started yelling at me while I was still in the shower about sharing it online and calling him creepy. At the same time he was guilt tripping me and telling me that it was romantic and he did it because he loved me, he literally read a few of the comments out loud to me. He barely let me out of the shower but I did manage to get my clothes on while he was screaming at me. What really freaked me out was that he started listing off things that he could’ve done to me, I won’t list them here because it was extremely gruesome and I don’t think it’s allowed, but he said that he didn’t do those things because he’s such a nice guy. The way he described the things he could’ve done though made me feel like he had genuinely considered doing it. Also, I thought he was only watching me for a few months, apparently it was upwards of a year and it was genuine actual stalking. He had followed me home and to my college campus, he pulled out a collection of my lost hair ties that he kept.

I told him that he was scaring me and that we needed to take a break and come back to it later. At that he put a hole in the wall next to my head. I told him that I was leaving after that because fuck that shit and it was like a switch flipped and he started crying, he got on his knees and begged me to stay and apologized. I ended up accepting his apology because I didn’t feel safe leaving. Yesterday morning after he’d left for work I grabbed all my important documents and irreplaceable things before my clinicals started and kept them in my car. After my clinical I didn’t go back to the apartment. I’m not going to give much more detail than that because he does know my account obviously. 

And for Andrew if you’re reading this, which we both know you are, please just leave me alone. The person I thought I loved doesn’t actually exist and that’s heartbreaking. I no longer feel safe with you like I did before and I hate that. Please let’s just move on from each other.

Location: Virginia 

Long story short, my ex boyfriend ended up being more than a little crazy. I learned that he stalked me for over a year before we started dating and after I learned that he became violent. I have screenshots of threats of violence that he’s sent me, as well as pictures of some bruises that I have from him. There’s also security footage of him attempting to sneak into my place of work to find me. My local police department has been generally unhelpful with their advice and have told me that unless he’s actively harming me they can’t do anything. This is regardless of all of the evidence I have that he fully intends to hurt and/or kill me. They have taken statements from me and there is a report open though. 

Do you believe the evidence I have is sufficient to get an order of protection? And if I am going to file one do I need to have a lawyer? 

Edit: I’ve received help, thank you!

[Update 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/UJo3unS7Fg) - June 23, 2025

Honestly I just wanna scream into the void because this is annoying as shit. It’s scary too, but I’m mostly just fed up with it. 

Like I’m not even that pretty, why did you latch onto me? Why did you decide to constantly text and call me after we broke up? On that note, did you think threatening to murder me would woo me back into your arms? Showing up at my clinicals is also really shitty and not even because I’m scared, but because telling my educator and the hospital I’m trying to learn at that my ex boyfriend is psycho is embarrassing for me! Also, lowkey embarrassed that I dated a guy without knowing he stalked me for over a year prior to our relationship. 

Not to mention I’m spiraling between laughing hysterically at what my life has come to and just wanting to straight up end it all because I’m so tired of being on edge all the time. It’d be easier to just sleep and not wake up. I haven’t gotten a full night of sleep in weeks though, so… thanks. 

Also, literally self defense stuff is so expensive I hate it so much, like yes my safety is important, but who has this much money to spend? But I have to spend it because even the cops say they can’t help unless he’s actively attacking me and getting a protective order is great and all but it doesn’t mean shit if they won’t follow it!!!! 

Ughhhh! Fuck you asshole, you know who you are.

**Editor’s note: this is where things get complicated because it seems like OOP’s ex took over the account for a bit**

“OOP” (aka the ex boyfriend) made a now deleted post titled “Update on my situation” which essentially said that they had overreacted and they had gotten back with her boyfriend. 

**Relevant comments from when ex-boyfriend was on the account**

*thread one*

>u/SchemeMoist: okay Andrew, we totally believe you and are not hoping to god that you only have her account and didn’t kidnap her or something. Can “you” explain how you moved past him hurting you physically and how “you” were overreacting to his murder threats?

>u/chronicallydrawing: Look. Will it make yall feel better if I admit I’m Andrew? She’s legitimately fine. Admittedly I was pretty dramatic with my threats but that’s because it broke my heart for her to leave. But she’s back home with me now and she’s safe.

*thread two*

>u/TallacGirl: Hmmmm.... I wonder why? You told your girlfriend who you stalked all the things you could have done to her, but didn't, and then punched a hole in the wall near her head, she fled. And now you're on her account being like EVERYTHING IS FINE. Just so you are aware, none of this is fucking normal. So, yeah. A bunch of people think you are a legit psycho.

>u/chronicallydrawing: Lmao. would it make everyone chill if I let her back on you think? I wanted her to focus on our us time but yall are going crazy. She's just some stranger to you guys. No idea why yall care

>u/TallacGirl: this is either horrific or fake. Either way, you are an epic weirdo.

>u/chronicallydrawing: 🙄 thx. Well she's waking up now so imma go spend my time with her because contrary to popular belief she's literally fine

**Relevant comments from when OOP got her account back**

>u/phoebe_gov: yall is there a way we can make sure she’s actually okay?

>u/chronicallydrawing: I sent a proof of life photo to another user earlier this morning. Promise I’m actually okay, my situation isn’t ideal right now but I’m alive and okay. I’m at my clinicals currently so don’t be alarmed if I delete any comments or anything later when I’m going back home today. 

>u/phoebe_gov: really? why remove your past two post then? why not give more of an explanation as to why you seemingly reconciled so quickly? you were threatening her life and she was looking into getting a restraining order and now everything’s okay? no one believes you

>u/chronicallydrawing: Look admittedly what happened was really shady. I did go back with him because I felt like I'd be in more danger if I didn't. Atm I'm working things out, yes I'm being purposefully vague. I'm able to get to my clinicals currently and I'm doing my best to use that to my advantage. As for the deleted posts, I didn't delete anything but I'm not surprised he did. I'm personally considering deleting this post because I'm worried about what will happen if someone contacts the authorities and things escalate.

1m4bp4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1m4bp4d/feeling_very_hurt_by_someone_i_thought_to_be_a/,"Feeling very hurt by someone I thought to be a close friend. Gaslighting, condescending , lying and no apology. RANT ALERT. 🚨","I’ve had narcissistic toxic exes before but when it’s someone you thought to be a close girl friend, it just hits different you know ? Like a lot more shocking , confusing and hurtful. 

So here’s some context. 

We’re two Irish girls working for a large construction company in Australia. I’ve worked for them for nearly 6 years and she’s been with us for 3 years. She’s single and lives alone the past few years (after a long term breakup) and she’s starting to freak out about her age (32) and wants to meet someone and have a family. 

I’m 34, married with a 2 year old. When she joined the company we work for , we bonded over both being Irish and close in age. She sort of clung to me as a friend and opened up about a lot of things. When I met her, she had only one other girlfriend who she’d recently had a big falling out with and was not talking to anymore. She was really hurt by this girl , she moved her new boyfriend into their rental without asking and he was very inconsiderate and rude to her and she kicked them out and never heard from her friend again.

I sympathised with her. From what it sounded like, her friend had used her and took her for granted. 

We grew close quickly. She helped organise my baby shower and literally showered me in presents. She would visit during my maternity leave and bring my baby presents.  She was a very good, caring friend I thought. 

Anyone let’s cut to the other side of this friendship. 

Last November, another one of my coworkers who I’ve worked with for 6 years and is also a fairly close friend rang me at work one day. (Let’s call her Rachel) She said she wanted to tell me that the Irish coworker/friend (let’s call her Lisa) had been out on one of our job sites going around bitching about me over a mistake I had made at work (mind you a very minor mistake that could be fixed at the click of a button - it was a typo I had made that meant our budget on something showed a wrong figure - something instantly fixable ) and she was saying things like “Aimee’s worked here long enough that she shouldn’t be making mistakes like this, she should know better etc” 

Anyway…. ‘Rachel’ overheard this conversation and said to her “well instead of bitching about your friend behind her back, why don’t you go and have a conversation with her and explain that it’s wrong”. Rachel text me and told me and said she didn’t think it was fair that Lisa was going around talking about this behind my back. When I confronted Lisa about it she denied it and said she never said that and it was none of her business , why was she listening to a conversation that didn’t involve her. 

The next day I was out on the job site and a few people came up to me saying “I heard you and Lisa had a falling out” one of the guys said , I had to agree with Rachel, it was pretty bad the way Lisa was bagging you out… so I then knew for a fact Rachel was telling the truth and looking out for me.  But Lisa was annoyed that she got caught so essentially it was all Rachel’s fault !!


Fast forward a week, Lisa uninvites Rachel to her birthday dinner in town. She spent the night telling me how disappointed she was with me that I believed she would say those things about me and she thought better of me. (She even said I should be wondering why Rachel was trying to upset me and why would a friend do that)

Even though I knew she was gaslighting me , it was her bday and I didn’t want another fight so I just apologised and said let’s just move on. We never spoke about it again. She was extremely nice to me after that and leaving coffees on my desk in the mornings before I’d get in and asking about my son all the time and offering to babysit etc and  we seemed to put it behind us and got closer again. 

Last week something happened again. (8 months after the first incident) I found out from a work colleague that Lisa had told people a very personal secret that I confided in her with. I was absolutely shocked and so hurt. 

I text her and said “X just asked me about X. You knew that was a very personal secret that I trusted you with and you promised you wouldn’t tell anyone”  instead of apologising she replied “don’t take what X said to you out on me” 

I said oh I’m not Lisa, I’m annoyed and upset with you. I trusted you. She replied “I didn’t tell anyone, I’m inclined to believe you told a staff member yourself and you’ve forgotten” 

Anyway I’ve since distanced myself from her. Feeling very hurt. Still no apology. This was about 4 days ago. Nothing. And she’s been avoiding me at work. 

I’m so over shitty people. I’ve been a really good friend to her and a huge emotional support to her. I’ve included her in my life as part of my family and she’s been nothing but two faced. I can see now the presents and coffees etc were just a way of “love- bombing” the same way narcissists love bomb their partners.

I had two rewards to use and $29 and change left on a gift card from the prime day sale. 

So I got:
In the Stars FFM
WVW Single wick candle 
The last 2 Easter carrot cake hand soaps they had left on the SAS table
3 full-size hand sanitizers for my bathroom, kitchen, and bedroom 
And a few more pocketbacs: one mini cookie bites, 2 gummi snacks, 2 to the moons, 2 moisturizing sweet cinnamon pumpkin, and 2 moisturizing cinnamon caramel swirl 

My total came out to 21 cents less than I had on the gift card. I was so dumbfounded to have actually pulled off not going over what I said I’d spent that I just stood there staring at her when she said “do you want the 21 cents back, or leave it on the card?”
Like, to the point of awkwardness. Like, to the point of her apologizing for confusing me. LMAO 🤣 
Anyway, I was proud of that and glad I didn’t get more body care items I didn’t need. 

My two “scents” on a couple of the newer items: 
I liked the glazed pumpkin. I feel like it gave exactly what it said it did. I would use it but not as a regular scent. Likely a purse lotion during the season type of thing. 
Book Loft seems a bit overrated, but who am I to knock what other people like. I love that it’s available and bringing so many people joy. 😊 
Vanilla ease is a lovely, light bedtime scent. (I’m a big lavender for bedtime girlie pop). Vanilla cafe was delicious, but I wouldn’t wear it. It was so rich. 🤤 Wearing coffee scents is strange to me, but I’m likely the strange one. 🙃
Pumpkin spiced latte three wick was delightful. It gave the total essence of fall to me (in addition to the PSL).  
Football season was underwhelming - nothing striking about it to set it apart from anything else. 
Maple pumpkin was good if you’re into maple; I didn’t detect much pumpkin. 
The other newer fall release candles were meh. Again, nothing remarkable - to the point I don’t remember their names. 
I found the vintage vinyl room spray to be interestingly refreshing. I’m terrible at describing scents, but I did smell multiple different “notes” in it. Even after I had sprayed it (on my arm), I feel like I kept smelling different parts of it. 
The leather bound pages was nice! I feel like they pulled it off successfully; I noticed each of the notes distinctively. I don’t know that I’d want it on my hands or body though. I feel like it’s giving more of a candle or room spray vibe. 🤔 

If you’re still reading this blabbering novel, I’m not sure why 😂, but happy shopping and scrolling to my fellow BBWorks redditor homies! 🤗",5,1752971764.0,bathandbodyworks,1,1.0,False

Dear Dr. K,

I’m a 26-year-old male working as a Legal Advisor to my city’s mayor. For years, I struggled with a pattern: the moment I felt ""trapped"" in any major area of my life be it romantic relationships,studies, or work I would abruptly change course, chasing the dopamine rush of new interests.

During university, I excelled and earned significant respect from professors. However, when offered a faculty position, I felt suffocated by the prospect of a predictable academic life and walked away, convinced I needed ""more.""

I then pursued law, joining the city as a Legal Assistant. Thrilled by the challenge, I quickly advanced to become the Mayor’s Legal Advisor. Yet, after a year, familiar boredom set in. I feared ""wasting my life at a desk"" and hesitated to fully commit, worried I might be making the wrong long-term choice.

Recently, I was offered the Director of Legal Affairs position—a major promotion. Instead of excitement, I felt trapped again. My instinct was extreme: not only to decline the role but to quit entirely and open a coffee shop in my city, I wanted I life my calm. The fear of dedicating my life to one path felt paralyzing.

Everything changed when I discovered your content on the “Puer Aeternus” archetype. It was like hearing my own soul described. I finally recognized how deeply this pattern influenced my decisions—especially the relentless fear of commitment and the urge to flee.

Now, I’m actively challenging this mindset daily. My relationship with work has transformed:  
- I no longer rely solely on bursts of interest to perform.  
- I’m less afraid of dedicating myself to this career path.  
- Actually enjoying life for once, even if I do have boring aspects. 

Crucially, I also recognize that suicidal ideation is neither healthy nor an option. That darkness no longer has a place in my thoughts.

Thank you, Dr. K. Your insight didn’t just change my perspective, it saved my life.",4,1752971656.0,Healthygamergg,2,1.0,False

For context, my SO (26m) and I (26f) were highschool sweethearts - dated for 5 years through highschool & into college, separated in college and went our separate ways, got back together almost 2 years ago after 5-6 years apart and unintentionally got pregnant and had our beautiful daughter whom we both see as a wonderful gift & blessing to us - anyway, he works 5 days per week, with an hour long commute, and is gone from the house for 10-14 hours each work day (including commute) depending on sales (he works for a car dealership). I work full time as an RN, 3 x 12-hour shifts every week. I work on his two days off, and I’m home 4 days a week while he works. My commute is about 30 minutes so I am gone from the house anywhere from 13.5-15 hours on my work days depending on how intense my shift was and if I need to stay and finish charting before going home. His parents cover childcare for our daughter every other weekend when we are both working.

That being said, my point is that he is out of the house at work 50-70 hours a week (which is a ton, and he’s currently trying to get promoted and has a good shot at it, and I’m trying to be very grateful for that! Not at all calling him lazy!!) I am out of the house at work 40.5-45 hours a week but over 3 days instead of 5. We are both exhausted after working.

He is introverted, I am extroverted/ambiverted. We are both messy people - not dirty, like no molding dishes or wading through trash - but messy like we both have baskets of clean laundry that we dig through instead of putting away, we both leave glasses of water upstairs, the PlayStation controllers are on the coffee table, etc.

On the days that either one of us is home, we take care of our daughter who is 8 months old, born preemie adjusted 7 months, which is a full-time job itself, haha :) she is formula fed, so lots of bottles and all the regular baby tasks like diapering, bathing etc.

So here’s the thing. I am essentially the only one that gives her baths. I am the only one that feeds her solids to advance her diet appropriately & that means washing the high chair and her little apron bibs, I do all three of our laundry & just omit folding because I don’t have time. I sweep. I mop. I am the only one that vacuums. I take out the trash/recycling 80% of the time. And when he does it, it’s only if I’ve asked him to and I have to tie the bags and leave it outside the front door, and even then sometimes he’ll let it sit there for a couple of days and then I am so fed up and embarrassed that we have trash outside our front door that I end up taking it to the dumpster (we rent a townhome). 
He does dishes sometimes but I do them mainly. I cook all meals unless I specifically ask him to make his macaroni that I love and even then he’ll ask me to step in and “make it better” aka add seasonings and what not (I do love cooking so this isn’t a huge deal at all). But I also do all of the grocery shopping. I do our budgeting. I plan meals and keep track of what items need restocking like diapers, wipes, shampoo, toothpaste, paper towels, etc etc and I do all the shopping on my days off.

I constantly am resetting the living room. Toys in the toy box, fold up blankets, reset pillows, wipe down the coffee table, collect dirty baby clothes and our socks, put away both of our shoes, reshelf books, dust, fix the curtains that get tangled because of the cats. Etc.

I clean the litter box 7/10 times. He’ll do it like 50% of the times I ask because he’ll be like “well it wasn’t that bad so I figured it could wait” - like wait for what? Wait for me to do it?

I feed the cats. I fill the cat water. I collect cat toys from around the house. I clean the toilets, sinks, counters, bathtub. I clean our daughter’s room. I set up our entire patio including string lights and a fire pit and porch swing, just for us to use it and then I’m stuck cleaning up s’mores sticks and making sure the lights are unplugged and the chairs and fire pit are covered so the rain doesn’t ruin them.

I am the only one who goes through the fridge and cleans out leftovers that have gone bad. I am the only one who switches out our daughter’s dresser with new clothes every time she sizes up. 

Gosh sorry this is a RANT. Bottom line: I feel like I’m doing 95% of trying to just maintain a clean-ish house and he is barely doing 5% and usually only if I ask. And when I do ask, he does things like “feeding the cats” but only fills the tray and not the basin of our cat food feeder thing that is like gravity fed which leaves me having to fill it anyway like a day later.

I want to throw in I’ve asked for help I feel like a million times and it feels like he does not care that it bothers me and just says “don’t let your environment have so much control over your mood” or “you’re home twice as much as I am” but I literally don’t know how to relax in a space that feels like it’s constantly in need of decluttering knowing that it’s entirely my responsibility to do it. I just feel like a failure all the time I’m at home. And I feel like completely spread thin and that he forgets I also work full-time outside the house.

Also, we do not have a garage so storing items takes work with fitting into closets and then unpacking/repacking closets when things need to get used (for example, the wagon I use to take our daughter to the park and the grocery store).

So I’ve been so overwhelmed with not being able to keep up with everything that I decided my daughter and I are going to stay with my sister for a couple of days just to get away for a second and reset. That meant I needed to clean out my car and make space for our bags and the pack and play and what not - my sister lives 4 hours away. So everything that was in my car, I brought inside. It was a bunch of stuff I’ve been leaving in my car to use all summer - our daughter’s pool float, the wagon, the regular stroller, roller skates, chalk, a sunshade, etc. all of this would be put into a garage if we had one. 

So when he came home last night around 9pm, I was just burnt out and frustrated at this huge mess of stuff that I did indeed bring inside, but it was on top of all the other chores and mess that I already can’t stay on top of alone, so I was like “can you PLEASE help me with this?” The water was shut off all day yesterday, so I hadn’t showered or brushed my teeth, our daughter fought going to bed, and I was just totally fried. He says “why don’t you go take a shower” and so I did, thinking he would at least pick up the dirty clothes on the living room floor or maybe put a couple of the summer items in the storage closet. But when I came back down after showering, he was playing SmashBros. So I like tweaked and kind of lost it haha I wasn’t totally mean, but I was like “seriously? Can you not just help me with some of this?” There was stuff blocking the front door, scattered about the room, wrappers from snacks, idek what else but just stuff that needed to be taken care of.

We argued and I just signed off and went to bed at about 11:30pm because I’m also the one that wakes up every morning with our daughter between 5-6am and all I said was “I’m going to bed, please help with some of this” because he was planning to stay up a bit later.

So this morning, nothing was different in the living room. I called him and was like “seriously? Wtf?” And he says “I did help. (Like snarky) I pushed in the piano bench and moved the coffee table back into place.” The piano bench was moved 6-8” (I measured with my phone because it like freaking sent me over the edge) and it wasn’t even pushed in all the way. The coffee table was moved about a foot from a diagonal position to parallel with the couch how it should be, but he moved it on top of some of our daughter’s dirty clothes from the day before. Then he placed the doona collapsible stroller on top of the coffee table, on top of a wrapper/piece of garbage ??? How is that helpful ??? Like what ?? In what world does the stroller belong on top of our glass coffee table ???


I feel like I’m losing my mind and I don’t know if I’m the AH or if he’s the AH and if I have a right to be pissed or not. I know he works a ton, is exhausted, just wants to relax. But I also work, I’m exhausted, and I cannot relax whatsoever in a space that is in constant disarray. I’m easily overstimulated and have synesthesia and probably some other undiagnosed mild condition that leads to me feeling so overwhelmed. Or maybe I’m just normal and other people would feel overwhelmed too? I have no idea. AITA for being angry with him for doing what I think is a slap in the face to me and calling it “helping” ?",1,1752971296.0,AITARelationship,0,1.0,False

Before, I saw recovery as nothing but hard work, therapy, and endless self-reflection—and that was true—but I forgot that joy could be medicine, too. I learned that when I laugh, my brain releases endorphins that lift my mood in a healthy way. It’s like my own built-in feel-good cocktail, without any of the hangover or regret.

# Best Paper Cup Holder 2025: Top Picks & Buying Guide

The paper cup holder is a seemingly simple,yet essential accessory for various settings. From bustling office breakrooms to convenient coffee shops and even home kitchens, these holders provide a practical and hygienic solution for dispensing disposable cups. In 2025, the market offers a wide range of options, each with its own set of features and benefits. Selecting the right paper cup holder can greatly improve efficiency and organization while maintaining cleanliness and convenience. This comprehensive guide will navigate you through the top contenders and help you make an informed decision based on your specific needs.

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal paper cup holder transcends mere functionality; it blends seamless design with robust practicality, ensuring efficient cup dispensing, easy maintenance, and durable performance. Evaluating the key features is critical to selecting a holder fit for the demands of its intended habitat.

**Material and Construction:** The selection of materials significantly impacts the durability and longevity of a paper cup holder. High-quality plastics,stainless steel,and even sustainable bamboo are common choices.

A durable material should resist cracking, warping, or rusting, especially in high-traffic areas where the holder is frequently used. Consider the gauge of the material,with thicker constructions providing a more stable and robust unit that can withstand daily wear and tear. Seamless designs prevent the accumulation of moisture and grime, enhancing hygiene and ease of cleaning. Look for holders with reinforced stress points to prevent potential damage from repeated use and weight.**Capacity and Cup size:** The capacity of a paper cup holder dictates how many cups it can store at one time, directly impacting how often it needs to be refilled. Cup size compatibility ensures a snug fit that dispenses cups individually without jamming.

Choose a holder capacity based on your usage frequency and traffic volume. A small office might need a holder with a 50-cup capacity, while a busy coffee shop could benefit from a 100+ cup holder.Verify that the holder accommodates the range of cup sizes you typically use, from small 8-ounce cups to larger 20-ounce sizes.Adjustable mechanisms or interchangeable sleeves can accommodate varying cup diameters, ensuring optimal dispensing without wasted space.

**Mounting Options:** The mounting options available for a paper cup holder determine its versatility and suitability for different placements. Wall mounting, countertop standing, or under-cabinet installation each offers distinct advantages.Wall-mounted holders save counter space and are ideal for areas with limited surface area. consider the wall type (drywall, tile, etc.) and mounting hardware required for a secure installation. Countertop holders offer portability and versatility, making them easy to reposition as needed. Look for models with non-slip bases to prevent them from sliding or tipping. Under-cabinet holders are discreet and space-saving, perfect for smaller kitchens or breakrooms. Ensure adequate clearance beneath the cabinet to accommodate the holder and cups.

**Dispensing Mechanism:** The dispensing mechanism is at the heart of a paper cup holder's functionality, ensuring that cups are released individually and smoothly without frustrating jams or multiple dispenses.

Good dispensing mechanisms employ a spring-loaded or gravity-fed system that pushes cups forward one at a time. spring tension should be calibrated appropriately to prevent overly aggressive dispensing or cups getting stuck. Holders with clear viewing windows let you monitor the cup level and anticipate refills. Some advanced models feature adjustable dispensing slots to accommodate different cup rim diameters, further minimizing jamming. Consider models with a protective shield or cover to prevent dust and contaminants from entering the cup stack.

## Core Benefits

Implementing high-quality paper cup holders brings a multitude of tangible benefits to any environment, from streamlining operations to promoting hygiene and reducing waste. They contribute significantly to organization, convenience, and cost-effectiveness.

**Improved Organization and Efficiency:** By consolidating paper cups into a designated holder, these accessories drastically reduce clutter and create a more organized and efficient workspace. The absence of scattered cups translates to faster service in cafes and quicker access in office environments.

Employees spend less time searching for cups and more time focused on their primary tasks.Businesses can create a cleaner and more professional impression on customers and visitors. Streamlined operations minimize the potential for accidents such as spills or knocked-over stacks of cups, further improving workplace safety. Organized cup dispensing minimizes waste by preventing cups from being crushed, contaminated, or lost.

**Enhanced Hygiene and Sanitation:** Paper cup holders mitigate the risk of contamination by preventing direct contact with the cups, ensuring a more sanitary dispensing process. This is especially crucial in public spaces where maintaining high hygiene standards is paramount.

Cup holders protect cups from dust, airborne particles, and accidental splashes. Sealed or covered holders offer an extra layer of protection, notably in environments with high traffic or food preparation. Consistent use of cup holders reduces the temptation for people to reach into a stack and touch multiple cups, minimizing the spread of germs. They contribute to a culture of cleanliness,demonstrating a commitment to hygiene for both employees and customers.

**Cost Reduction through Waste Minimization:** Strategic use of paper cup holders can lead to considerable cost savings by reducing cup waste. the controlled dispensing mechanism limits the incidence of multiple cups being taken at onc, preventing unnecessary consumption.

by dispensing single cups upon demand, holders discourage the common practice of inadvertently taking more cups than needed. The organized dispensing system helps prevent cups from becoming damaged or soiled, rendering them unusable. Accurate tracking of cup usage becomes easier, which helps inform future purchasing decisions and optimize inventory management. This not only saves money on cup procurement, but also reduces the environmental impact associated with disposal of unused cups.

## FAQs Section

navigating the features and functionality of paper cup holders can frequently enough raise questions for consumers. Understanding the practical aspects ensures a confident and well-informed buying decision.

**What types of paper cups are compatible with most holders?**
Most standard paper cup holders are designed to accommodate a range of cup sizes, typically from 8 ounces to 20 ounces. Worldwide models can often accommodate both cone-shaped and straight-walled cups. Check the product specifications to ensure compatibility with the specific cup sizes and styles you intend to use. Models with adjustable mechanisms offer greater versatility, making them suitable for varying cup diameters.

**How do I clean and maintain a paper cup holder?**
cleaning methods depend on the material, but most paper cup holders can be cleaned using warm water and mild soap. Wipe down the holder regularly to remove dust, spills, and fingerprints. Stainless steel models can be polished with a microfiber cloth to maintain their shine.Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads that can damage the surface. Disassemble the holder periodically to clean internal components and ensure smooth dispensing.

**Can I use a paper cup holder for foam or plastic cups?**
While primarily designed for paper cups, some holders may also accommodate foam or plastic cups of similar shapes and sizes. However, it's significant to consider the dispensing mechanism's compatibility with different materials. Foam cups may be more prone to tearing or deformation if the spring tension is too strong. Plastic cups may slide too easily, leading to multiple dispenses.Always test with a small quantity of foam or plastic cups before fully loading the holder.

\-Watch the entire LOTR EE trilogy over a few days. I've owned them on disc for a very long time (first on BluRay and now on 4k BluRay haha) but have never gotten around to actually watching them. This seems like the perfect time! I've got a nice movie setup at home with surround sound, so I'm also open to movie nights with other movies as well. Though I'd want to hang out a couple times first before having anyone over to my apartment.



\-Try some automotive photography. I enjoy photography in general and have a decent mirrorless camera and a fun car. I'd like to drive to a picturesque spot and shoot some photos. Bonus points if you have some experience (especially in post processing).



\-Play Split Fiction! I'm currently playing this with another friend (who I coincidentally also met off this subreddit a couple years back!) but he has a busy life and a family, so it's going to be at a much slower pace. Would be cool to start a new game where we can play a solid 2+ hours a day until the game is done. I've got the game on Steam, and apparently player 2 does not need their own copy.



\-I'm also open to new experiences. So if there's anything you've been wanting to do but haven't found the company to do it with - let me know! Maybe we can try it together.",2,1752971028.0,Vancouver4Friends,1,1.0,False

1m4b92y,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1m4b92y/software_engineer_to_front_office_trader_is_it/,Software Engineer to Front Office Trader: Is it worth the move?,"Been working in a top US bank as a software developer for over 5 years. After years of grinding, I have moved into one of the most high-profile software engineer roles within the company. I have the opportunity to work on code that directly impacts the day-to-day trading business.

However, I'm still considered a 'tech' person, and there's a huge cap on my bonus and I'm often deemed a middle office second-class less-important employee. Over the years, I have seen multiple software engineers transition internally to a front office (usually trading) role. It's not easy, but it's definitely possible if you are willing to put in the work. My question is, is it really worth it?

1. I enjoy both the coding and finance parts of the job, but coding definitely comes more easily for me. Not sure if I can perform well in a 100% financial role.  
2. My current job gives me a lot of flexibility, I can grab coffee between meetings/ leave early if there's nothing urgent. I even have time after work to cook my own dinner/ meet friends/gym.  
3. Exit options for software engineers seem much better? I managed to secure interviews with almost all financial firms as a software engineer, and I can even pivot into tech if I get fed up with finance one day. Trading, on the other hand, seems more limited as people tend to get associated with very specific roles and asset classes. I have barely seen any traders in my firm leave their jobs.  
4. Our ultimate goal is to buy a bigger house for me and my partner, and moving to the front office will definitely speed up the process. We are not planning to have kids, and we are financially comfortable now (no debts + manage to save up some money every month)

I need recommendations on machines, the cart, sourcing beans and whatnot, etc. Can I DIY the cart, or should I buy a commercial bev cart? Do I need a grinder that is separate from the machine? Specific brand and model recs are more than welcome!

I’m going to leave 2 or 3 images of my stats from the “Renpho” app which is the brand of scales I use.

So probably 6 months ago I made a post on this subreddit that I wanted to lose weight and I laid out a plan and I was really motivated. However I didn’t lock in to the plan until about 4 months after that and I’ve since deleted that post.

In the last 1.5-2 months I’ve lost roughly 10 kg which is about 22 lbs in American units (I’m Australian 🇦🇺) I am a 5’8 male. I would say I have a thicker build than typical, probably mostly mesomorph but also endomorph body type if you believe in those sort of body types. I have larger arms and upper body than typical is what I’m trying to say, but I feel like I’m mostly a mesomorph.

Things I’ve been doing. I mostly do the same routine every day. Usually a salad from subway with double meat, extra avocado, every salad available, no sauce. This is expensive but I feel like it’s pretty low calorie and a healthy way of getting protein to start my day. If I don’t have a salad I will buy a bakery pie or 2. Then usually either some fruit or some protein yoghurt for lunch, then I eat whatever meal my partners family cook for dinner, I just make sure my dinner isn’t large. I exercise every day without fail. I aim for at least 60 minutes of walking a day but 9 times out of 10 I’m doing closer to 90 minutes. Sometimes I do outside walks because the area I’m in is peaceful and there’s a nice walking track, sometimes I hop on the treadmill. When I’m using the treadmill I will also shadow box for a minute or 2 every 10 minutes of my workout, I feel like my indoor exercise is more intense than my outdoor exercise because it’s more private. I do bicep curls at night time most days of the week. I started off counting calories and aimed for 1600 to 1800 calories a day, then I realised that I can eat more than that and still lose weight because of the amount of exercise I do. I actually found that at one point I could pretty much eat as much as I want (to a degree) and still lose weight because my metabolism definitely increased. Now I don’t count calories I just do the daily food that I mentioned. Also cut out all added sugar, and only drink zero sugar drinks. You don’t realise how much you crave a zero sugar coke until you’ve been doing this sort of lifestyle! I make sure to only have 1-3 of them a day, I also have coffee in my daily routine.

I first bought new scales because the ones we had were not only inaccurate but the results were changing in the same weighing session, I bought renpho scales and got an accurate measurement, also verified it at the doctors and they are pretty damn accurate, they were like 50 dollars AUD, so pretty cheap. I feel like this was a good motivator because not only did I have a starting point but the renpho app is actually very motivating with the stats and everything.

I haven’t been in my ideal weight range since I was probably 18 (I’m 30 now) and I’m now slowly closing in on my goal weight of 85 kg. Apparently my ideal weight is under 75 but I don’t really believe that, I feel like for my build 85 would almost be perfect. Also because I’m only 5’8 I want to keep a little weight because strength is relative to weight. 

I’ll put my renpho stats below, I know they look and sound horrible but I really don’t look bad and I have a lot of energy and motivation these days. I’m fully locked in to get to my goal weight. I just wanted to flex the 10 kg I’ve lost in not even 2 months. Also these stats are based off what doctors would consider ideal, and we know that bmi and weight will differ from different bodies, and that someone who’s perfectly healthy can still have a high bmi. Anyways I hope I don’t get too much hate, just was feeling pretty proud this morning 💪🏼❤️‍🩹

Ahhh just realised that this community doesn’t allow attachments, bummer!

My starting weight was 104.3 kg, I’m now 94.65 kg. My bmi is now 32 where it was 34 point something before, my body fat% is now down to 29% where it was once at 35%. There’s so many more stats that have improved that I wanted to show but can’t because this sub doesn’t allow pictures 🥲 Anyways hope everyone has a great day/night ❤️‍🩹",1,1752970639.0,WeightLossAdvice,0,1.0,False

I have a nagging headache but I've been fending it off decently will water and painkillers. My stomach has churned because I ate a whole box of chocolate raisins in one sitting, knowing full well I shouldn't have, and the excess of sweets and fast food have fought me to a stand-still. I am hoping I hold the line for the rest of the night. I am still going to have a cookie with my evening coffee so rest assured, I did not learn a thing.

Anyway, I adored Superman and F1 far more than I expected to. The drive-in was also much busier than I expect; it is delightful to see it's still so active after all these years. I forgot how old-fashioned the whole place was; rough gravel and overgrown grass. The intermission animations had to have been at least 50 years old; so lovely and hand-drawn. There was a lot of people my age and younger, which was wonderful. Hardly the dying past-time I feared it to be.

As for my day today, I am astonished to tell you that I've finished the second chapter of I'm Still Sisyphus. Though, I must admit, I am partially cheated. Reading over my outline again, I decided it would be better to end the second chapter quite a few pages back, meaning that I am also already halfway through the third chapters. I barely have to re-edit anything. Aside from those changes, I wrote around 658 words. The first chapter is 60 pages while the second is only 12 pages. So far the third chapter is 8 pages. We're making decent progress. Wish me luck.

The training is good and I feel like both of us benefit (I generally do well in competitions and am competitive, I pay for this persons time both at home and at comps)

Recently at a comp my coach made a mistake when going over the pattern prior to competing. This resulted in losing what would have been a milestone win for me. The coach felt bad and apologized at the time but I had to take a walk to get over the feelings of embarrassment and loss before speaking to them.  

While I took the walk a team photo was taken without me and posted on social media. And later another person on the team approached me and told me that I had an attitude problem (confusing because I did not say or do Anything other than walk away) 

I attempted to speak to the coach about this and they were not available to meet or talk to me until I was already in bed and I did not answer my phone. 

A week later coach agreed to meet me at a coffee shop to discuss what had happened and in a soft voice tore into me, told me I have a bad temper, that everyone on the team is afraid of me, that I knew when the group photo was being taken and it was a consequence of my actions that I was not included and that they can’t control what other people on the team say to me. I cried through the entire encounter and left without resolving anything. 

AITA in this situation or is the coach?

Asha started a conversation with me just randomly and we spoke for 2-3 days on chats. As days passed our chats went personal and turned in to some light sexts. 2 weeks back from today I asked if she would like to get in action anytime soon. She agreed. 

But she asked if we could meet at some cafe before just so that she can get comfortable with me, to which I agreed upon. The cafe decided by me was a famous coffee franchise. She agreed but we never met as every time we scheduled, she would come up with some or the other excuse of postponing it. 

We haven’t met yet and 2 days back she msgd me asking for 3.5k for some project work. Btw she’s a freelancer and looking for a full time now. I ignored her msg to which she had an audacity to say “I asked you something. Plz reply. Just dont leave my texts on seen. I don’t like it at all”. I replied her after a day that Im out cash currently but since i would like to help you, let me ask it from my friend. I had no intention to give her a penny. 

Now the climax, Asha doesn’t know that I meet Tina randomly nor Tina knows that I’ve been in contact with Asha. 

Last night i met Tina after a long time, and saw she started consuming chems, and invited me for the same to which I plainly denied. But while she was into it, she spoke about Asha that she was also invited only on the condition that if she contributes 3.5k for the stuff. I was shocked to know this but controlled my feelings and asked her more about Asha but Tina chose not to back-bitch more about her. But Tina really had some negative vibes about Asha, that I noticed through her facial expressions. 

Now i would like to get back to Asha to ask her about the reason she was asking me the money for. Should i just directly confront her of being a lier or play some game around and eventually make her feel that what she did wasn’t right with me. 

Need your help in the kind of way to take this further with Asha. How do I speak to her now. Would really like her to realize that some guys aren’t so ignorant, that you can plainly fool us in pretext of getting physical with us.

1m4b5d5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m4b5d5,"Found a Cockroach in My Drink at Rianne’s Churreria — No Apology, Just Gaslighting","Trigger warning on the photos. Posting this for awareness.

I’ve been putting off posting this because I honestly still feel so uncomfortable. I still have stomach aches since it happened… ughh. Just remembering it makes me want to throw up.

Last Friday afternoon (7/18/2025), my friend and I decided to hang out at Rianne’s Churreria while waiting for our other friends to arrive. It was my first time there, and I was genuinely excited since I heard their churros were great. We ordered churros and iced honey lemonade, got comfy, and started catching up.

A bit later, another friend joined us. While we were busy chatting snd catching up, I absentmindedly played with the ice and straw in my drink. I was almost done with it when I noticed something dark at the bottom of the cup.

It was a cockroach.

I almost cried and nearly puked. We were all stunned and didn’t know how to react. None of us are confrontational — we just froze. We even called another friend to ask what we should do, and he suggested we at least ask for a refund. I was still trying my best to keep it together and not throw up, so my best friend bravely brought the cup to the counter and politely asked for a refund.

That’s when things went from bad to worse.

Instead of showing concern or apologizing, the staff immediately dismissed us with, “Naglupad lang na guro sa baso mo,” implying the cockroach must have just flown into my drink. No apology. No accountability. Just defensiveness and denial.

My friends and I were seated face-to-face at a small round table the entire time. If a cockroach had flown into my drink, one of us would’ve seen it or screamed on the spot. We’re all terrified of cockroaches. There’s no way something that obvious would’ve gone unnoticed.

After overhearing the staff’s dismissive remark, I calmly went to the counter to explain this.

Another staff member then chimed in, insisting she “prepared the drink carefully” and would’ve “definitely seen it” if there was a cockroach. But let’s be real — how can anyone be that sure? The drink was iced honey lemonade, not some crystal-clear liquid. You can’t see everything through it, especially when it’s full of tube ice. That roach could’ve been hidden between the tube ice, or even frozen inside, and only became visible once the ice melted.

There are plenty of logical explanations for how it ended up there, but the idea that it just flew into my cup without a single one of us noticing? That’s incredibly unlikely. We weren’t distracted or moving around. We were right there, focused, seated tightly around the drink.

And if you’ve seen the photo — that’s not a tiny insect you’d easily miss. If it had flown in, it would’ve floated at the top first. Instead, I found it nearly at the bottom of the cup, after I’d already drunk most of it. That alone makes their version of events nearly impossible.

Still, no apology. No accountability. They just quickly remade the same drink — the one I nearly threw up over — and refused to give a refund (which was just ₱110). They treated us like we were making it up and kept gaslighting us. At that point, I just told my friends it wasn’t worth it, and we walked the hell out of there.

This was never about the money. It’s about how a food establishment completely failed to handle a serious hygiene issue with even the bare minimum of professionalism, empathy, or accountability.

This needs to be said. If you’re planning to visit Rianne’s Churreria, proceed with caution. Hygiene issues happen — but how a business responds to them matters even more.",27,1752970423.0,Bacolod,7,1.0,False

1m4b3zc,https://i.redd.it/t009h8k34xdf1.jpeg,Welp this is happening again :P,"Hello goobers :P 

I’m 17 and honestly I’m at my limit when it comes to this shit I am at my mom’s place and I get food and physical support but it comes with nonstop verbal abuse and gaslighting and her trying to manipulate me into thinking I am going insane now or saying I am always looking to start a fight if I even go downstairs to grab something to eat she just fucking atagnoizes me 24/7 and I am genuinely just getting done with it as it has ruined my mental health even more than it already was at, basically saying I have hit a new low relatively and cannot have fucking stability in life anymore since I turned 12 and It’s toxic here constantly, I feel like I’m constantly walking on eggshells in the house but over time I have just grown desensitized to everything and slowly going numb to everything she says now because its all meaningless

about 3 months ago I was living with my dad after leaving due to this abusive style of things and he basically had no food over there at his daughters house, where her, and her 3 kids live alongside him and I basically developed an eating disorder from being starved within a week or two of my life, alongside me constantly having nightmares of how she treated me every night for weeks on end.

Sadly in this situation neither his daughter or him ever lifted a finger to try and find ways to get more food and just ignored me, and honestly after all of this I just have an eating disorder and get disgusted when someone tries to entice me into food or thinking about food like just the image of it in my head makes me feel sick now relatively and I just drink coffee now to kill my hunger and only eat dinner.

eventually I called an ambulence and left and then my mom manipulated me while I was weak into coming home and promising all this sparkly shit to me and making quick use of me being in a vulnerable state as she talked me out of talking to my childrens aid agent and rushed me along to come home with her instead

once I got home she immediately got the case closed and was babying me and taking care of me, but after 2 weeks of being here she immediately started to ramp up the abuse again over time and now just is outright trying to convince everyone I am bipolar and constantly angry and trying to fuck up everyone and that I apparently do nothing around here for anything for her when she calls me 10+ times on the daily asking me to do shit constantly or interupting everything I do and if I say no she starts acting like a fucking child and screaming and yelling until she gets her way or provokes someone to their breaking point where they start screaming back then she plays the victim.

I also ran away when I turned 16 to go live with a friend in northern canada who i met online like 5 years ago only to encounter his mom who constantly policed me and was abusive towards me too and overstepped my boundaries 24/7 so, and the same thing happened where she monopolized the scenario and took advantage of me promising a bunch of things and saying it will be so much nicer then she became intensely verbally abusive after a while which made my dad leave and I also left to his daughters house a month after which caused the last scenario

Now my dads stuff is over there but he is here most the time due to him also being starved when he is over there as dinner is hardly if ever made over there and no one literally does anything, the 3 kids dont eat much and mostly eat all the food that they buy every week and my dad and his daughter sit out in the garage and smoke all day and drink coffee.

And when I was over there the CAS basically sat around with their thumb up their ass and just postponed things and ghosted me for weeks alongside just waiting and my school counselor just didn't do anything and only cared if I was suicidal and wasted my time constantly throughout the semester which caused me to eventually fail one of my classes this semester due to all of this constant bullshit with family and the counsellor wasting my time and not attending school that often due to transport problems and family issues

Youth support orgs also didn't support me saying that I still ""technically"" had a home to return too and didn't care if I was being starved to death or not and since my dad wouldn't kick me out and make me homeless then no org would support me, and basically no support networks within the general area would ever help me due to this technicallity.

Now i am sitting at my moms house, with no irl friends and my one friend from the north basically got all cozy with me and sexual then ghosted me after I left the apartment he was at, so I have no irl support networks, and no orgs within the region will ever help me due to me technically having support so I have literally no alternative

**So the question is now**  
  
do I get verbally abused everyday and manipulated constantly for 1 year straight and my mom constantly threatening to ""find alternatives"" aka kick me out of the house but never does anything and drive me to the fucking point of genuinely being suicidal traumatize me more.

OR

Return to my dad's and have mental peace but get fucking starved to death likely before I even turn 18 at this point or go to the hospital constantly because he refuses to properly take care of me when I was there.

sorry for the heavy mood on this I just dont know what to do anymore and genuinely wish I was in a coma, I wish my parents would just both fucking die at this point and I could just be free or just kill myself at this point as I cannot deal with it anymore.",14,1752970303.0,sillyboyclub,6,1.0,False

Only in the summer of 2023 is when i went into my first ""flare."" My initial symptoms before that were only back pain and stiffness, fatigue, as well as pain in ribs and sternum, which i was told was costochondritis that would go away in weeks, which lasted for years. During my first major flare, it started in my achilles tendons and knees, feeling like every step was tearing the tendons from my bones. Brutal is an understatement. It progressively moved to other parts not initially affected, like my shoulders, hips, and my fingers and toes, sometimes bilateral, sometimes unilateral. Not much noticeable swelling, but so much pain and stiffness it would keep me up at night. For instance, i'd have to run my hands under warm water in the morning to even open a coffee can. I had to stop working out, going on hikes, all the things I loved. Finally went to PCP, and she thinks it's either lupus, RA, or AxSpA. She did blood work to check RF, ANA, HLA-B27 etc. All came back normal or negative. She put me on Mobic, and referred me to rheumatologist. Of course I waited 6 months to get into the rheumatologist, and by that time, the flare had subsided. She did blood work, xrays, MRI, all normal, completely dismissed most of my symptoms, prescribed me Celebrex 100mg twice daily, and diagnosed me with joint hypermobility syndrome, being that i am hypermobile, always have been. However, my mobility has drastically decreased over the past few years, but she doesn't see it based on my mobility at that point still being relatively normal. PCP is currently my only advocate, saying that she understands her reasoning behind the bull crap diagnosis, but knows there's more to it based on being my provider for over a decade, and has referred me to another rheumatologist. My last 2 flares have been on the milder side compared to the first, lasting a few months at a time, but still come with their challenges.

1m4b0ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/realtionshipadvice/comments/1m4b0ij/im_so_heartbroken/,I’m so heartbroken,"I was in a relationship with a girlfriend for about 7 months. We broke up back in March. After about 3 months of no contact, I ended up texting her. We spoke over the phone, and during that conversation, she told me I should’ve reached out sooner—unfortunately, she had started dating someone else and wanted to give it a real shot.
Fast forward a couple of months, I saw her pop up on Bumble, so I figured they must have broken up. I decided to message her, and she mentioned she was feeling sick. I offered to bring her some Gatorade and medicine, and she accepted. When I dropped it off, she gave me a tour of her new house and was very friendly.
A few days later, once she was feeling better, I asked her to grab coffee. She said yes, and we ended up having a great time—we even went to the movies. I went in for a kiss, but she pulled back and said, “Not yet,” which I totally understood. The next day, we hung out again. She brought up that it really upset her that I never introduced her to my daughters or made her feel like part of my family when we were together. I admitted I regretted that and told her I’d do things differently if we gave it another shot.
She told me she had broken up with the guy about two weeks earlier and went on Bumble out of frustration. She said she still had some feelings for both of us, to which I said I wasn’t interested in being in competition—I needed her to be sure. She replied that she probably wasn’t going back to him.
Later, we went to her place. She asked for a massage, took off her shirt, and lay face-down. After the massage, we lay in bed, and she ended up kissing me. About 20 minutes later, she said she needed to get up early, so I left.
The next day I texted her and suggested we catch a sunrise at one of our old spots. She said it wasn’t the best day for it and mentioned having a hair appointment. So I suggested going out on Friday instead, and she agreed. That was Monday.
Come Friday, I texted to see how her day was going. She replied after some delay, saying she was super stressed and wouldn’t be able to go out. Later that evening, she sent me a longer message apologizing, saying there’s just a lot of emotion and confusion and she was trying to figure out how to put it into words.
I told her to take her time and that when she was ready, she knew where to find me.
And now… nothing.

1m4avqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1m4avqf/aio_for_wanting_to_quit_after_my_manager_accused/,AIO for wanting to quit after my manager accused us of not liking the new hire because we “hate men”,"So I work in a coffee shop, and up until two months ago it was just me and my four other coworkers (we’re all girls). I won’t say the name of the place for anonymity’s sake, but it’s the overpriced one that most people hate (you know the one). I just started a few months ago and up until recently things were great. We pretty much all got along, and if anyone didn’t there wasn’t much argument or any awkwardness, we just came to work and did our jobs. My manager, I’ll call her Kate, was also one of the best I’ve had, and made the place fun to work at. Due to being slightly understaffed Kate needed to hire at least two more people after me.

The first one was an 18 year old guy, I’ll call him Rick. A few of us were curious if he’d be chill or not because apparently in the past the few men that did get hired ended up being creeps. But regardless, we all had an open mind and hoped he was cool. The first few days he seemed like a nice kid, a little inexperienced as the job goes but still pretty chill. We’re all around the same age (20-25) and he’s the youngest, so even though he was a little immature I got along with him well. But after about two weeks things started going wrong.

For starters, Rick likes to talk. Like, a *lot*. He seems to not yet be comfortable with silence (something that comes with maturity in my opinion) so will fill the space with anything. He’d often start conversations about something completely random and not really explain when we were confused. In addition, he likes to joke, and unfortunately the majority of them don’t land. At first I felt bad for him and tried harder to connect, because I know what it’s like to be young and awkward and not really know how to fit in with a new group, and that in itself isn’t bad. The actual issues started to show after he’d been there for another week or two.

It seems like he doesn’t really think before he talks, so about 1/5 things he says will be… well, weird. And loving to talk is a great thing in customer service, but not if you don’t know when to end the conversation. He does this thing where he’ll pick a random detail about the person to try and start a conversation about, and it seems to work and charm a few customers, but most of the time it gets really awkward and they’re not sure what he’s talking about. It also doesn’t help that most of the dialogue seems like a really bad attempt at flirting, and most of the time if the customer is attractive he does try to flirt in some round about way. It often leaves things quite awkward and no one really knows what to do, but again, that in itself isn’t the worst thing.

Unfortunately, he’s also just bad at the job itself. The coffee shop has a lot of in depth recipes and I understand needing time to grasp it. But he’s been here for almost two months now and consistently gets orders wrong, spills most of the drinks he tries to make, and forgets to ask for the customer’s names. In a normal situation, the manager at this point would probably take a day to do some more in depth training. However, our manager, Kate, *really* likes Rick. And I mean really. She’s even given him the nickname “reliable Rick”, and boasts about how eager he is to help and to learn. When we hear this we all hit each other with a tired look, because.. He’s really not that good at being a barista. I don’t mean this insultingly, he just hasn’t picked up a lot of the job. Issues with the actual job aside, what really set us over the edge was making comments about one our coworker’s weight multiple times.

The first time it happened we were all like “???” And shortly after went to Kate about it. Kate said she’d “talk to him about it”, so we assumed it wouldn’t be an issue in the future. And yet, just a few weeks later, he makes *another* comment about her weight. My coworker was clearly feeling incredibly insecure, especially since she had an eating disorder in the past. Rick didn’t know this, but that doesn’t really change much. At this point I went directly to Kate and told her something needs to change. The first time it happened was passed off as “not getting social cues and trying to joke around like we do”, and the second time she talked to him.. you guessed it, she came back telling us “he just tries to joke around like we do and can’t tell what’s okay and isn’t okay”. Look, we work in food service, we all joke around and talk shit. But never have we insulted each other, especially not on the basis of physical appearance.

At this point he’s been here for around two months and nearly every coworker has some sort of issue with Rick, and even now he still doesn’t do much beyond staying on register because “reliable Rick” can’t even be relied on to efficiently make drinks. A conversation Kate had with us today is really setting me over the edge here. Apparently, we’ve been too hard on Rick, and she has a rebuttal for every critique we’ve had. He misses inclusions on drink orders? Oh he just has auditory processing issues and sometimes doesn’t hear the first thing a customer says. He basically called our friend and coworker fat twice? Oh he’s just bad at social cues and wants to “joke” like we do. He forgets to ask if someone wants their drink hot or iced (multiple times in the same day)? Oh we should give him a break, he’s just having a long day. And finally, Kate thinks some of us hate men, and have a bias against him. According to her, because of our bias against men, we never gave him a chance to begin with.

At this point I’m just so done. We’ve been very patient with Rick in my opinion, but every shift he works it’s like a new issues pops up. And I didn’t even go into his religious comment implying he might go to hell because he’s friends with us due to believing in Jesus (most of us are a part of the LGBTQ community). Am I overreacting for thinking this is a serious issue? I know typing this all out does make it sound bad, but every time I get frustrated about it Kate comes in and tells us all we’re being too hard on him. I’ve really really tried to get along and work together with Rick, but Kate’s insistence on refusing to acknowledge his faults and claiming we have a bias against him almost seems like a bias in itself. It’s like she’s overcompensating for this supposed hatred of men by defending him to the end no matter what he does..

So I’ve been prescribed adderall/vyvanse since I was 16. I’ve always only really taken it when I needed it for class, or after school club activities back then. I took it every day all the time when my schedule needed it. Then I graduated and pretty much took it once every now and then bc I planned on going to college but life happened and I could no longer go to college for a while. 

I’m past my early 20s and I’ve started taking it twice everyday as prescribed (30mg IR) bc of my schedule. It was great at first, I felt like my normal functioning self; I started with 15mg then 30mg a month later. 30mg a day has always been my normal amount for every time I started taking my meds again. 

However, this time it worked for about a year til I started taking an extra 15mg at lunch or wait til after work if I had class after work that day.

It’s been nearly 2 years since daily usage, now on 30mg twice a day (60mg) and honestly it isn’t enough anymore. The first one in the morning feels how a strong cup of coffee feels(I don’t drink coffee). The second one I take after work, class or not, bc I need it to last until 8pm. Sometimes I have to take a third 30mg a day.

What do I do here? I haven’t talked to my doctor about this, they assume I’ve been taking my adderall everyday even though I’ve gone 6 months without refilling it before. 

Should I stop taking it and for a tolerance reset? I don’t know how I’d get by without it. Any ideas would be much appreciated.

1m4arek,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m4arek,"Have you ever heard of Puzzle Pandas? I’m one, so please allow me to share more about them…","I mentioned Puzzle Pandas in one of my recent puzzle posts, and was asked about what they are. To define them most simply, Puzzle Pandas play a worldwide game of hide and seek with puzzles that they are paying forward to others. Christine, the first Puzzle Panda started things off in 2020, and over these five years it’s grown to be a global sharing of Good Vibes & Good Karma”. I try to do at least one Puzzle Panda drop monthly, and have shared photos here of my June and July drops that I did on the same day last week, since I messed around and ran out of June. 😁 When I first learned about the Puzzle Pandas, I visited their website and Instagram account to learn more, and was also assisted by a friend who had already begun to do puzzle drops in California where she lives. They have official tags that you can either purchase inexpensively, or they will email you a pdf doc of the tags and puzzle log to place inside the puzzle box. I chose to get the pdf version in order to print my own tags, which I attach to a colored cardstock. Once I’ve placed tags onto the puzzles I’m dropping, with either ribbon or a rubber band, I then think about and decide which public place to drop them and head out. Once it’s been left, I snap a photo or two to share to my socials and with the Puzzle Panda socials, in the hope of leading someone to find the puzzle. It’s loads of fun to do, and I love imagining who has found it and hope that they enjoyed it! The first picture was a local place where several coworkers and I had lunch.

I want to lose weight but i just can't.,"Does anyone else struggle tremendously when it comes to losing weight?? These past few weeks i have been eating little (not intentionally restricting myself, I just forget.) but I've been gaining. I try my best to stick to a workout routine but i just keep falling away from it because i grow tired and i just don't want to do anything! 😖 I'm the heaviest i have ever been in my life and i feel as horrible as i look. 19 years old, 5'8 and i weigh 116 kgs.

My diet is honestly the worst too but that's because i genuinely can't afford to eat better, especially not in my country. Food in my town especially costs SO much more than it does in other towns. I live off of coffee, peanut butter sandwiches, and the occasional banana or apple. Its all my mum (bless her) can really afford right now. The good food we do sometimes have, we try spacing out as much as possible so there is atleast a few days out of the month that we eat a semi proper cooked meal.

I've been wanting to go to my doctor again but he's honestly not been helping me at all. I'm also flat broke at this point. I first went to a female doctor who was like 'low estrogen, go to gynecologist' and then ghosted me when i asked follow up questions. Then i went to my mum's doctor, where I got diagnosed with hypo, prescribed 50mcg levo at first, then 100mcg, and now i am at 200mcg. Don't get me wrong, the 200mcg has helped with virtually everything but the weight gain. 💔 I didn't even know that testing thyroid levels or whatever were a thing until i watched a video on hypo weight loss! You'd think doctors would tell patients about this stuff to help them to the best of their abilities, but apparently not.

I just needed to vent a bit. I am so frustrated with this danm thyroid disorder. I just want to feel and look good for once in my life but it is all so tiringggg!!! 🥲",3,1752969097.0,Hypothyroidism,2,1.0,False

I’m 23, and I’m kind of at the point in my life where making/keeping friends has kind of made its way to the lower end of my priorities. I work, I’m currently in school full time getting a masters degree, and I’m in a long term serious relationship so I don’t have a whole lot of extra time. However, I’ve realized that I haven’t had a group of really close friends since maybe early undergraduate years ? I’m a friendly person and I get along with plenty of people and I have quite a few acquaintances but only about one real friend (who now lives far away) aside from my partner. It’s kind of sad to think that I’m only 23 and have no one to go grab coffee with or go out to a bar with or whatever. I literally don’t even think that I know how to be friends with someone anymore. I’m always hesitant to reach out and try to plan things with people because it never seems to actually happen. It’s very hard for me to get comfortable with people and I can never tell if someone wants to be friends with me or if they just view me as an acquaintance. It’s such a weird and awkward feeling.

I work at a small hospital in a small town. I try to visit the chapel on my breaks. I should note, it’s technically a nondenominational chapel, but I live in Utah, so conclude what you want with that information. I pop my head around the corner and there’s a man by himself. I say hello and start walking away as I don’t feel comfortable going in the chapel when there might be grieving families/friends of patients. With that being said, I felt compelled to pop my head back in to make sure he was okay. Not to mention, it’s within my job responsibilities to do so. After I ask if he’s okay, he pauses and asks if I’m busy. I say no and ask what’s wrong. He then proceeds to pause again and says to me “do you wanna make out or something”?

I obviously say no and walk briskly back to a badge access only area. When I told my coworkers, it was definitely a comical conversation. However, it’s been 3 days and I’m still thinking about how odd it was. One of my coworkers had joked and said “maybe it’s a sign you shouldn’t be religious or maybe it was satan testing you”.

Some additional bits of information:

The chapel is so small, it could be the size of a drive through coffee stand. I was wearing surgical scrubs. There’s usually not anyone in the chapel.

There’s a coldness in how they treat him that’s hard to put into words. And he tells me he feels it.

Without telling anyone (except me) he built up a big online presence (500k followers) on IG, tiktok & youtube. He kept it private because he says "" no one would care ""... I tried to persuade him to at least open up to family but he didn’t want to be discouraged by their lack of caring...

Eventually his brother & parents found out (it wasn't me) - but even after discovering it they said not one word of support. No encouragement, no questions or surprise....  when he asked his brother what he thought, he replied, “didn’t think much of it” then ignored him again. That was the entire message, he showed me on his phone. He was depressed for weeks after that, even though he tries to hide it. 

Hard to watch the pain they all put him through... can't imagine my family acting like that... I thought maybe once they saw how big he was something would change.. I just can't imagine people behaving like this toward anyone..

He tells me he's always been the one always initiating messages, he calls his parents in the kitchen sometimes and I overhear it.. they either don't answer or say they're busy... I asked him what's going on and he told me he is used to it. People are “too busy.” His own parents (who are retired) never reach out unless he does first.. and even then, it’s lukewarm at best (from them to him). 

I've tried to arrange for him to meet my friends... one of my friends met him in the hallway & said ""*There’s nothing special about him, he's so ordinary”* which honestly disgusted me. How can someone judge a person like that from a five-second encounter? I obviously didn't pass this on. I never saw my friend act his way...

I recently started talking to my housemate about this topic as it's really affecting him nowadays (and no wonder)... I suggested he should put a post out to his followers asking for meet up or coffee (try to make friends that way).... He got tons of replies… from fans saying they wished they were nearby. He has loads of local followers but everywhere he goes, no one local makes the effort!! And when he travels to new areas, the replies are the same again. It’s like people are too shy to actually meet up. It seems to be a problem with the modern age...  they only want to text chat.

It’s like they want his content, but not him. Despite his massive audience, it's hard to see him hurting alone every day. I'm not always around... 

I don’t think I could live his life. I just needed to get this off my chest. I’ve never witnessed this kind of apathy toward anyone before.. honestly, it makes me lose faith in people

And no, we're not dating.

1m4ak0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1m4ak0l/feel_like_i_need_another_break_from_online_dating/,Feel like I need another break from online dating.,"Ugh. So this is literally just a rant. 

Recently got back into the online dating scene, after taking a six month break, after some truely awful dates last time. 

And the last two dates i've been on. Honestly. 

I'm 30f for reference.

So the first guy. Really nice, lovely actually. Lots in common. But half way through the date he tells me, 'I'm allergic to dogs, I could never imagine living with one. Cats all the way'. And yet, my profile is completely plastered with pics of me and my dog - and we spoke about it through the app beforehand, about me wanting to perhaps take in another rescue. And he was like all for it, and then on the date. Different story. 

He asked for a second date too, and I was like... 'I don't think we're compatible'. 

Then today...the second guy. So for starters, he was flakey about the time we were to meet. Even though HE arranged the date. Apparently he had football practise, which fair enough. Then he picked me up directly after football practise, in trackie bottoms and a 'dirty' T-shirt. I shrugged it off, we were meant to be going walking, so I was like I suppose it makes sense. I had put effort into my appearance though, even if I was in hiking boots. 

But he hadn't even showered after practise. 

It had been miserable weather all day long, like pouring down, so he suggested coffee instead. I was like, that's fine, 'going with the flow'. So he picked me up, and his dog was in the car. Right okay, as above - I love dogs; but it was quite a shock, and they were literally climbing on top of me, licking me ETC. Really dilluted the intimacy of the date from the offset. Also, he had clearly lied about his height - I don't usually pay attention to that stuff, but he was the same height as me (I'm 5'4, he'd put 5'8 on his profile). 

Anyways, we go for coffee, and we're chatting away; sat in the rain, because his dog wasn't allowed inside. It was going quite well, given the weird start to the date. I'm quite a chatterbox, so I can carry a convo relatively easily. And believe me, I was doin' some heavy lifting. 

Then all of a sudden he's like, we should go for that walk, barely finished my coffee and we were off. Walked for like an hour around a park. Again, chatting away. He kept saying he was tired😤. Obviously, like an excuse to get away, I supposed. But then he offered to take me to McDonalds, I declined. 

At this point, I just wanted to get home. 

Then he messages me afterwards, and he says he didn't feel a 'spark' and I thought to myself, of course you didn't!- You were so low effort, all intimacy was practically dead in the water. You basically used me as company whilst you walked your dog! Did our date, that YOU arranged fit into your routine okay? 

Best thing about him was his dog, Jeez. 

Again, i'm considering taking a break from the dating scene like, it's so mentally taxing. I have anxiety so getting ready for a date is draining, and each time it's an 'event' for me. And honestly, it feels like a waste of time, energy and money. 

I hate to sound ungrateful, but I'm just so done with it. Am I doing something wrong when it comes to online dating?  ",1,1752968706.0,dating_advice,8,0.67,False

Faded Notes

I awake to the sound of applause. The noise of the crowd and the vibrations of my table must’ve startled me. I squint through the smog of cigar smoke to see who’s playing, the piercing stage light nearly blinding me. The silhouette of a lone musician is all I can make out but the glimmer of his Alto sax is unmistakable. The crowd hushes, I hear the metallic clicking of the saxophone’s keys. The saxophonist draws in a breath-I’m suddenly squirming in anticipation. Then… nothing. The saxophonist begins to sway to an unheard beat, he lets out a labored breath as he stands. The crowd starts to whoop and yell in adoration. Is this a joke? Sweat begins to bead upon the musicians forehead, the room falls silent once again, every eye in the crowd fixed upon him, their bodies motionless, simply listening to his invisible song. The musician stops playing, the crowd goes wild, and as the musician takes a bow our eyes meet. The crowd’s wailings are beginning to morph into an ocean of sound. I feel someone grip my shoulder.

1m4ahu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1m4ahu2/emergency_alert_global_code_black/,EMERGENCY ALERT: Global Code Black,"Working in Hollow Core was never exciting, and maybe that was the point. The underground complex was built decades ago, designed to last for centuries. There are no windows, just corridors lit by cold lamps and cameras showing what's above—or at least what they tell us is “above.” Most screens display only a white haze and infinite darkness. They say the world outside is dead, toxic, beyond repair. I grew up hearing that. Everyone here did. We've never known daylight. We just learned to survive without it.

My name is Evan. I'm 34 years old, a security operator at Central Station Sector 4. My job is simple: monitor protocols, track routines, ensure no one exceeds the system's boundaries. I receive automated orders, follow strict schedules, and check reports. Each sector of the complex has its own routine, but all of them rely on us. Nobody questions anything. Here, asking too many questions is seen as emotional instability. And instability leads to reassignment. No one ever comes back from reassignment.

From time to time, there are emergency drills. Alarms blare, red lights flash, and everyone descends to secondary shelters. After a few hours, everything returns to normal. They're called simulations, reaction tests. The system insists this keeps us prepared. But in practice, it only increases the fear of something nobody understands. No one knows what would trigger a real alert. We only know that if it happens, there'll be no warning—just the sound of the siren. And one instruction: seal the doors.

Until then, nothing gave me reason to doubt Hollow Core's security. Life was repetitive, but stable. The rules were cold, but clear. And the system, despite being impersonal, worked. Or at least it was good at pretending. I used to believe that. Until the day a real transmission broke through all barriers, and my job went from routine to survival.

It all started during the night shift. Simulations usually happen during the day, when more operators are active and responses are easier to monitor. But at that moment, there was no test alarm. No countdown. Just the piercing shriek of the main siren, cutting through the silence like a blade. The kind of sound we didn't hear in simulations. It vibrated erratically, as if the system itself was hesitant to activate it.

On the main screen, a new message overlaid the cameras:

“EMERGENCY ALERT – GLOBAL CODE BLACK”

I'd never seen this type of alert. There were no automatic instructions, no simulation marked on the internal calendar. Everything went silent for a second, and then the security protocol engaged on its own. Containment doors slammed shut on all levels. Access to stairwells, elevators, and tunnels sealed with a metallic clang. Some lights began to flicker, but nothing seemed to indicate an electrical failure. It was as if everything had been planned... only no one had told us.

I tried to contact Command Sector, but all frequencies were dead. Supervision stations didn't respond. My supervisor, Caleb Finch, vanished from the system without any warning. His badge was deactivated, and his last activities simply disappeared from the logs. It was as if he'd never been here. The only thing that appeared on my terminal was a blinking red line, accompanied by a phrase that repeated like a mantra:

“Do not open any passageway. Under any circumstances.”

I turned the panel off and on again, thinking it might be a software glitch. But the message remained. Unchanged. As if it had been engraved directly into the system's core. I tried to reverse the manual lockdowns. Nothing responded. Not even the emergency commands. The external cameras stopped transmitting, and the internal ones began to alternate between static images and black screens. None of the other operators in my sector reappeared. It was as if I were the only one left in all of Hollow Core.

For years, we'd heard that a ""Code Black"" meant maximum risk of external exposure. A total collapse in environmental security. But there was no practical record of it. No clear guidelines, no specific protocol. It was almost a myth. Something only mentioned in the early days of training, and then forgotten. Which made everything worse. Because now it was real.

I sat in silence for long minutes. The only sound was the server fan behind me. No voice, no command. Just that fixed message, occupying the center of the screen as a reminder that everything had changed. Something had escaped the pattern. And the system didn't want me to know what it was.

At that moment, I realized a truth I had avoided confronting until then: we weren't being protected. We were being contained. And maybe, I wasn't the only living thing still functioning in there.

The first few minutes after the lockdown were filled with silence and a strange sense of abandonment. Hollow Core had always been a lonely place, but there was a kind of order to it. A feeling that, even separated, we were all following something larger, even if invisible.

\*\*\*

But at that moment, it was as if the entire complex had been deliberately emptied, as if its only remaining function was to observe my reaction.

With no contact from any other operator and the channels closed, I began searching internal files for answers. I first tried the security team's records, but many of the files were protected by passwords that even my Level Three access couldn't break. Others seemed to have simply been erased. Instead of error messages, codes I'd never seen before appeared—a sequence that always ended with the same tag: “REDACTED\_BY\_PROTOCOL\_BLACK.”

Forcing the old systems in the maintenance server, I accessed operation logs from decades past. I hoped to find patterns of old simulations or any indication of a previous Code Black. What I found was... worse. Three similar occurrences had been recorded in the last fifty years. All marked with the same alert. All abruptly terminated with a single final code: “Colony Silenced.” None of the subsequent documents mentioned what happened to the inhabitants. The reports were always cut off at the same point: a few minutes after the alert activation. It was as if the history had been intentionally erased.

I also found a hidden directory within the audio central database. Stored there were hundreds of voice recordings from old operators. Almost all were corrupted, distorted, covered in static. But I managed to isolate one. It was short, less than twenty seconds. A hoarse, gasping male voice said:

“If you're hearing this, it means you stayed. This isn't an evacuation. This is a siege. The system lies. The doors don't protect us... they separate us from what we were.”

I stood still for a while after hearing that. I repeated the message several times, trying to understand what he meant by “what we were.” Was it a metaphor? Or something literal? The voice sounded familiar, but maybe it was just fear trying to find logic where there was none. I checked the name of the operator who had left the recording: E. Masters. My own last name. But there was no record of another operator with that name in the last thirty years. None.

Time began to distort. The lights in the room changed intensity without a pattern. The digital clock at my station froze at 02:17 and kept showing that time, even as minutes passed on the other panels. I started having memory lapses—small forgetfulness. A coffee I made but didn't drink. A document I edited but didn't remember writing. My reflection on the security screen looked... a little older than yesterday.

I decided to activate internal cameras in adjacent sectors to check for signs of movement. Most displayed empty corridors, without any human presence. But in two sectors, the monitors showed figures standing in the corners—motionless. The images were grainy, as if recorded with 80s equipment, even though all systems were digital and updated. When I tried to zoom in, the image disappeared. Only a black screen remained with the message: “Access level exceeded. Restore isolation protocol.”

It was clear the system didn't want me to see what was in the other corridors. And worse: it knew I was trying.

By the end of that morning, I sat at the base of the control tower with the headset still on. It was looping, hearing my own breath. Everything around seemed dead, but something in the back of my mind began to gnaw at me: what if the alert hadn't been triggered to contain an event? What if it had been activated to contain someone?

During the first hours of the second day, the system started emitting sounds again. It wasn't a human voice, not even a clear recording. Just pulses. Interference at short intervals, as if something was trying to find an outgoing channel. At first, I thought it was just random noise, perhaps caused by a malfunction in the communication core. But the pulses were too consistent to be accidental. Frequent, interspersed with small variations in tone. It was like a coded message, insistent, that no one had authorized.

I turned on the auxiliary receivers—a practice usually discouraged. They access old, almost obsolete channels that were used in the initial phases of Hollow Core's construction, before digital transmissions became standard. These channels are no longer in official use, and precisely for that reason, they're dangerous: they have no filter, authentication, or encryption. They pick up anything. And that's exactly what happened.

A voice emerged almost immediately. Low, like a distant whisper, with a muffled, drawn-out timbre. I couldn't understand everything at first, but some words became clear.

“Are you still there? Did you stay too? They lie.”

The voice seemed weak, as if transmitting from very far away. But it wasn't just distance. It was as if the very structure of the sound was damaged, as if the person on the other end was trapped in a place where physical rules didn't quite work. A place where time doesn't pass the same way.

I asked for a name. The voice stopped.

\*\*\*

For a few seconds, there was no sound at all. Then it returned, but the tone shifted. It was higher-pitched, and now it repeated words I had just spoken.

“What's your name? What's your name?”

I turned off the receiver.

I tried to ignore it, but when I reviewed the channel's security files, I realized the voice recording hadn't been saved. The system registered a transmission time, but no data. As if nothing had been said. As if the conversation had only occurred within my mind.

Desperate for answers, I went to the ventilation tunnel control room. It was a rarely used location, where old operators accessed the deepest routes of the complex. There, the tunnel map was still physical—illuminated panels with manual buttons. And there I noticed something strange. An entire sector was blinking red: Sector 0. We'd never heard of it. It wasn't in any manual, any digital blueprint, any official directive. But on the analog panel, it was there. A huge area, isolated from the main tunnels, connected only by a line ending in an unnamed arrow. And most unsettling: the system indicated recent activity in that sector. Someone—or something—had passed through there in the last 36 hours.

I returned to my station and forced open the camera closest to the phantom sector. For a few minutes, the screen was black. Then, slowly, an image appeared. It was the usual corridor, no movement, except for something that shouldn't have been there: a figure standing, with its back to me, at the end of the tunnel. It looked like a man, but something about the shape didn't make sense. The neck was tilted at an impossible angle, and the arms hung unnaturally. The image trembled. When I tried to zoom in, the figure turned its head slightly, and for a second I was sure of what I saw: it was my face. Expressionless. Lifeless. But it was me.

The image vanished, replaced by the message:

“Camera compromised. Recalibrating visual integrity security.”

In an attempt to understand what was happening, I reactivated the surveillance network microphones. That's when I heard the same voice as before—now repeating a single phrase, coming from different sectors at the same time:

“They know you know.”

I started noticing distortions in the logs. Overlapping timestamps, duplicate reports, copies of messages I myself had written but never sent. In one of them, the signature at the bottom was mine, but the digital handwriting was slightly different. More... rigid. As if someone was trying to imitate my way of writing, but without understanding human subtleties.

Audio recordings began playing sounds even before I pressed the button. It was as if the system was guessing what I was going to say—or worse, as if it had already lived this moment before. The records began to show my activities in areas I had never visited. My badge being used in sealed sectors. My fingerprints accessing locked doors. A version of me moving independently, through the same structures where I was confined.

On the third day, the surveillance system notified me of a new protocol:

“Duplicate operator in action. Monitor with caution. Interference may be fatal.”

I looked at the camera. For an instant, it turned on by itself. And I saw myself on the screen. But it wasn't a common transmission. I was looking directly at myself—in real-time. And what I saw was... subtle. A difference in posture. The way that “me” kept its eyes fixed, without blinking. A slight delay in movements. It was as if it was observing to learn. Copying. And now it already knew how to look like me.

I shut down all systems. But the feeling of being watched didn't go away. In fact, it intensified.

From the fourth day, I started losing track of time. The main station clock froze at 02:17 and never worked again. I no longer knew if it was day or night, if hours or days had passed. Everything inside Hollow Core seemed to operate on its own cadence, as if the complex was adjusting to a rhythm that no longer included human beings.

I tried to sleep, but every time I closed my eyes, I heard the sound of my own voice being repeated by the loudspeakers. Sometimes entire phrases I'd never spoken. Sometimes sounds of breathing that synchronized with mine until, suddenly, they began to speed up or stop completely. My heartbeats followed the same pattern—accelerating, then freezing in anticipation. As if something was imitating me so perfectly that, somehow, my body started to follow the rhythm of this invisible copy.

I went to Isolation Room 3, where theoretically no external signal should enter. There, the walls are reinforced, there are no monitors or cameras. Just a closed terminal with an offline system, used for psychological decompression during long missions. I locked the door with my personal security code and stayed there, in silence. But even there, the feeling of being watched didn't disappear. On the contrary. It grew. It was as if the silence itself was watching me. I felt eyes on me even with my eyes closed.

\*\*\*

On the third night locked in there, I was awakened by a metallic sound coming from inside the wall. First a click. Then a slow dragging. It wasn't a rat. The sound was too heavy, as if something was trying to move inside the concrete. The lights began to flicker, and for an instant, everything turned red. When they returned to normal, I noticed that the terminal—which wasn't connected to any network—displayed a message:

“You are occupied.”

No sender. No time. No login log.

I started to doubt everything. My own sanity. The structure. The rules. I began to question whether the alert had even been activated or if I had always been in this condition. What if all this was part of a cycle? What if this was just another repetition among many? I tried to recall my life before Hollow Core. The faces of my parents. The house where I grew up. But the images were blurry, generic. As if they were planted memories. When I thought of my first day at work, I remembered the corridor... but not the way to it. No route. No faces.

I sought my reflection in a small metallic surface on the wall of the room. Something was different. My eyes seemed less deep. My skin, a little more rigid. I stood there for long minutes, trying to identify what had changed. And then it hit me: I hadn't blinked in a long time. I didn't feel thirsty. Or hungry. And yet, I wasn't dying.

I returned to the main station the next day—or at least I thought it was. But the structure was different. The corridors seemed longer. Some doors were in places where there had once been walls. Command Room 2 now displayed a plaque with my full name engraved: Evan Masters – Unit 07. That had never been there before. And, as far as I knew, I wasn't a unit. I was a person.

I tried to access internal logs to check if anyone had made changes, but the system no longer recognized me as an authorized user. My badge was denied. My fingerprints failed. The vocal recognition keyboard requested a new identification. I typed my name. The answer was direct:

“Name already in use. Duplicate operator detected.”

I stood there for a long time, staring at that message. I felt my stomach churn, but there was no pain. Just the idea of what pain should be. That's when I realized: I was only imitating reactions. As if my body still remembered what it should feel, but no longer felt anything real.

That night, I went back to my cabin. Or what was left of it. The space seemed too clean. None of my personal belongings were there. No mug, no photos. There was only a bed, a dim lamp, and an envelope on the table. I opened it with trembling hands. Inside, just a sheet with a single handwritten phrase:

“You're not the first to notice.”

I haven't slept since. The complex seemed to pulsate with a life of its own. The walls emitted deep sounds, almost like heartbeats. The loudspeakers turned on by themselves and played snippets of conversations I never participated in. Quotes from manuals I never read. Excerpts from emergency warnings, all ending with the same phrase:

“Operator 07 in containment. Avoid contact.”

On the fifth day, I tried to communicate with the surface—even though there was no guarantee it still existed. I used a forgotten emergency channel, directly connected to an antenna on top of the structure, sealed since the early years. I sent a single sentence:

“The system lies. The emergency isn't outside. It's inside.”

I waited for hours. Then the return came. But not in the form of a human response. The same voice I had heard in the tunnels—identical to mine—repeated every word I had sent. With the same rhythm. The same intonation.

And then it completed:

“Message received. Initiating replication.”

After that response, something in me broke. The idea that I was just an obedient cog in Hollow Core no longer made sense. Not even the idea of being human seemed safe. I spent hours searching old sectors, using maintenance paths almost no one knew about. I wanted to find physical proof that the complex once housed real people—documents, objects, anything that would validate my memory. But the more I searched, the more empty spaces I found. Sealed rooms without furniture. Erased records. Blurred photos. Employee names replaced by codes.

That's when I found Archive Zero, hidden behind a false wall at the base of the Technical Tower. An analog compartment, sealed with mechanical locks. For some reason, my badge still worked there. Inside, there were dozens of old hard drives, accompanied by printed reports, all marked with the same header:

Project Hollow Mind: Neural Replication Study | Unit 07 – Active.

The pages spoke of an initiative prior to global isolation. According to the reports, Hollow Core wasn't just a shelter. It was an experiment. A testing center to preserve human mental patterns through autonomous digital copies. The goal was to prevent the total loss of knowledge after a civilization collapse. Minds considered “useful” were mapped, stored, and replicated within the complex.

\*\*\*

They would live continuous simulations, believing themselves to be real, operating the critical functions of the system while the external world restructured itself.

It was hard to accept. But every detail pointed to it. The name ""Evan Masters"" appeared in all reports as one of the first functional models. The technical notes described my functions, emotional responses, recorded failures... even my resistance to accepting my own origin. Everything documented. Everything foreseen.

The emergency alert, the so-called “Code Black,” wasn't triggered by an external threat. It was a containment mechanism. It served to interrupt cycles in which a copy began to distrust itself. The goal was to reset consciousness before it escaped the program's limits.

I wasn't alive. I was in a loop.

I sent one last transmission. I used all available channels, including the forbidden ones. My voice sounded firm, even though inside I no longer knew who was speaking. The message was simple:

“If anyone can hear me, don't trust the alerts. They aren't warnings. They're cages.”

I waited, alone, surrounded by machines that no longer blinked. Not even the system responded. Until, without warning, a new transmission appeared on the screen. A short video, recorded minutes earlier. It was me, sitting exactly where I was, with the same clothes, the same eyes, the same tone. But the recording wasn't mine. It had never been made by me. And at the end, it said:

“Message received. Initiating Unit 07 restart.”

I felt the air around me grow denser. The lights flickered. The loudspeakers played my voice, now clean, without hesitation:

“EMERGENCY ALERT: Subject 07 reactivated. Seal all levels.”

I stood there, paralyzed, staring at the terminal. And in that final instant, I understood what Hollow Core truly was: a cycle. A deep well of echoes, where minds were preserved like repeating ghosts. There was no escape. Because there was nowhere to flee.

This will be my last entry. And if you're listening... don't reply.

Because maybe... it's already you speaking.",1,1752968543.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

Jim Linsey got into a fight. 

When Daisy Underwood received the call from the police station, it was already eleven o'clock at night. 

Her college dormitory had strict access control, and when Daisy tried to leave, the dorm supervisor made things difficult for her. In the end, the supervisor sighed as if lamenting the state of the world, saying, ""You college students nowadays... You're a young lady, yet you don't know how to conduct yourself..."" 

Daisy knew the supervisor had misunderstood, but she didn't have time to explain. She hurried out. After braving the heavy snow to flag down a taxi at the side entrance of the school, she headed to the police station. 

Bailing Jim out required some paperwork, mainly filling out forms and paying a fee. 

The officer asked Daisy, ""What is your relationship with Jim Linsey?"" 

Daisy hesitated for a moment before answering, ""I've been his very good friend since childhood."" 

The Linsey and Underwood families had a long-standing friendship. When Daisy's grandfather, Alan Underwood, was alive, he and Jim's grandfather, Joseph Linsey, had arranged a betrothal between their grandchildren. Neither Jim's parents nor hers objected. Jim's parents tacitly agreed that Daisy would eventually become their daughter-in-law. 



Among everyone, only Jim had an ambiguous attitude. Did he ever strongly oppose this arrangement? Not really. Whenever he was teased about this, he would just laugh it off. But did he agree with this arrangement? Not really either. Because he had never privately told Daisy that he wanted to be with her. 



He treated Daisy well, but it seemed he always maintained a certain distance. 



This attitude sometimes left Daisy feeling a bit anxious. However, as a girl, she was shy. Even though she really liked Jim and had accepted the arrangement between their families in her heart, she found it hard to say anything outright. To this day, she could only refer to herself as his very good friend since childhood. 



""He only has one emergency contact in his phone, and that's you. I thought you were family,"" the officer said, somewhat surprised, ""he smashed up a bar for his girlfriend."" 



Daisy paused. Doubting her hearing, she asked, ""What... His girlfriend?"" 



""Yeah, a girl named Ingrid Chase. When they were at the bar, some thugs were bothering Miss Chase, and Mr. Linsey just smashed a bottle over one of their heads..."" The officer clicked his tongue. ""He's pretty ruthless. That guy is still in the hospital for surgery, and the bar is also involved. You guys need to figure out how to handle this. It might even lead to a lawsuit."" 



Daisy was completely stunned. She and Jim communicated almost every day, whether through messages or calls, and he had never mentioned that he had a girlfriend. 



After completing the paperwork, Jim was led out by the officer. 



As soon as Daisy looked up, she noticed a new scar on his forehead. 



It was two inches long, slanting across his left temple, just scabbed over, and it stood out prominently on his handsome face. 



This wasn't Jim's first fight. 



Jim's history of fighting could be dated back to their middle school days. This young heir was raised with indulgence. With the Linsey family's wealth and influence, compromise and retreat were never in his vocabulary. He had lived recklessly and arrogantly all these years. 



He approached Daisy and called out, ""Daisy Bud."" 



Those close to Daisy called her by her given name, but only Jim insisted on being different, adding ""bud"" to her name. Though it was just a nickname, it carried a hint of intimacy. 



At that moment, Daisy was still trying to process everything. She stared at the cut on his forehead, instinctively wanting to ask if it hurt. But as she was about to speak out, she instead asked, ""Who is Ingrid?"" 



Jim paused for a moment, gently tugging at her sleeve to lead her out of the police station lobby. ""Let's talk outside."" 



The forecast predicted a snowstorm tonight, but the severity of the weather exceeded expectations. 



Daisy, with her slender frame, felt as if she might be blown away. She regretted hastily grabbing a wool coat on her way out, clearly inadequate against the wind and snow. 



Jim guided her across the street to the hotel on the other side. 



Daisy's thoughts were a jumble as she wrapped her coat tighter around herself. But her frozen mind was still trying to figure out who Ingrid was. 



Once they entered the hotel lobby, warmed by the air conditioning, she felt as if she had come back to life, slowly clenching her stiff fingers. 



Jim didn't stop at the front desk but took her straight to the elevator, casually explaining, ""Ingrid is my girlfriend. I was planning to introduce her to you soon, but today this happened... She's in a room upstairs."" 



Daisy remained in a daze, feeling numb from the cold. It was only when they stepped out of the elevator that she remembered to ask, ""Since she's your girlfriend, why didn't she come to bail you out?"" 



""She was harassed by some thugs and was really shaken up,"" Jim explained as they walked, ""besides, the storm outside is so bad..."" 



Only after saying that did he realize it was inappropriate. He then said, ""Thanks for your help tonight, Daisy Bud. Once this is all sorted out, I'll take you out for dinner."" 



Daisy felt as if the storm had blown straight into her heart. She felt unbearably cold. 



Jim knocked on the door, and soon someone came to answer. As the door swung open, the person rushed straight into Jim's arms. 



Ingrid spoke with a quivering voice, ""You scared me to death... Why were you so impulsive, getting into a fight with those people... Are you hurt? Does it hurt?"" 



""I'm fine."" Jim pressed Ingrid's hand down as she reached for his forehead, clearing his throat to indicate that there was another person present.  ""This is Daisy Bud,"" he introduced. 



Only then did Ingrid realize there was someone else beside her and turn to look at Daisy. 



Daisy had a somewhat cool appearance. She didn't wear any make-up, yet she didn't look plain. However, in comparison, the made-up Ingrid looked much more refined. 



""So you're Daisy Bud. Jimmy talks about you all the time. Nice to meet you,"" Ingrid said, extending her hand. Daisy hesitated for a moment before reciprocating the handshake out of politeness. 



As they entered the room and closed the door, Jim had just sat down on the sofa when Ingrid leaned in again, using a tissue to wipe his wounds. 



Daisy felt uncomfortable, standing still. 



Jim pushed Ingrid's hands away and said, ""Don't bother. I'll wash up later. First, let's find a place for Daisy Bud to stay. Her college dormitory is probably locked."" 



Jim picked up the hotel phone to call the front desk, but after just a couple of sentences, he hung up. 



Due to the extreme weather, the hotel was fully booked. 



Ingrid pouted and said, ""There's no way we can get a room now. I booked this king-size bedroom for us this morning."" 



Daisy's first thought was that these two had booked a room together in the morning, and it was a king-size bedroom. 



She couldn't understand how her thoughts had strayed so far. But the more she tried to suppress her thoughts, the more uncontrollable they became. She thought to herself, ""Had they really progressed to this point? How long had they been dating?"" 



Jim had hidden it so well. 



About a month ago, when she saw him at the Linsey family gathering, Joseph had jokingly asked him when he planned to bring her home as his bride. Daisy had blushed, and she clearly remembered how he responded. 



He told Joseph, ""Grandpa, you're too eager. We should at least wait until Daisy Bud graduates."" 



Her misunderstanding deepened with his vague attitude.  She often felt that she must be special to him as he was to her. 



But now, she felt like he had played a huge joke on her. 



She couldn't bring herself to smile, pulling out her phone to look down, and said, ""It's fine. I'll look for other hotels nearby."" 



Ingrid suggested, ""We will help you look on our phone. And you should hurry downstairs and see if there are any other hotels around available. If we manage to book one, we'll call you. It'll be more efficient if we both act at the same time."" 



Daisy wasn't stupid. It was clear that Ingrid was trying to drive her away. 



She didn't want to linger either, so she turned and walked out. 



""Wait, I'll walk you..."" Before Jim could finish his sentence, Ingrid quickly grabbed his arm. 



""You're injured. Why are you running around? You should rest..."" 



Daisy didn't catch the rest of their words as she stepped outside and closed the door behind her. 



As she exited the hotel, a chill hit her face. The world seemed to be enveloped in a swirling white veil. 



Daisy tightened her coat around her, feeling snowflakes land on her long eyelashes, only to fall away with her blink, like a tear. 



Chapter 2 Jim Gave Her Nothing but Snow Tonight



Jim had a playful nature, and Daisy was well aware of that.



As a child, he enjoyed games like skateboarding, and during college, he was into bands, skiing, and more. John, his father, had hoped he would study abroad and return to take over the family business, but after graduating, Jim refused to continue his education and instead took up racing.



He played with everything except women.



It was precisely because he didn't engage with any women that Daisy had allowed herself to harbor feelings towards him for so long.



She thought that since he didn't have a girlfriend and never clarified anything to his parents, he must be like her, silently accepting the childhood betrothal between their families.



Now, she couldn't believe how foolish she had been.



There weren't many hotels nearby. Daisy had checked on her phone map. After walking two blocks through the wind and snow, she finally entered another hotel.



She approached the front desk, shivering as she took out her phone to ask if there were any rooms available.



The receptionist politely replied, ""I'm sorry, ma'am, but we are fully booked for the night.""



Daisy felt as if the world was closing in on her.



In this weather, she truly didn't have the courage to go out searching for another hotel. She stood stiffly at the front desk, contemplating whether to just sit on the sofa in the hotel lobby for the night when suddenly, she heard a voice call out, ""Miss Undwerwood.""



Startled, she turned to look.



A man in a black trench coat approached. He was tall, with long legs, handsome features, and an air of sophistication. Daisy stared into his eyes for several seconds before instinctively responding with a name, asking, ""Lenore?""



As soon as the words left her mouth, she regretted her impulsiveness.



Lenore Linsey was Jim's half-brother, three years older than her. Out of politeness and their unfamiliarity, she should have addressed him as Mr. Linsey.



However, Lenore had a unique status as John's illegitimate son, and even Jim had never referred to him as a brother.



Daisy hadn't interacted much with him, and even now, she wasn't sure how to address him.



Lenore didn't seem to mind the way she addressed him. He frowned and asked what she was doing at the hotel so late.



His voice was low, and Daisy felt a string in her heart being plucked.



Perhaps it was because she was feeling so vulnerable at that moment. Even this small gesture of concern made her nose tingle with emotion.



""Jim got into a fight, and I just went to the police station to bail him out,"" she replied honestly.



Lenore wasn't surprised and asked, ""Where's he? Why are you alone?""



""He booked a room at the hotel near the police station with his girlfriend,"" Daisy replied. Her tone was heavy with disappointment. ""When I left, the dorm was locked, and I couldn't go back. There were no other rooms available at that hotel, and I didn't want to stay with them, so I came here to ask around.""



Upon hearing this, Lenore paused for a moment. ""Aren't you... Aren't you his girlfriend?""



He had heard about that so-called childhood engagement. As far as he remembered, both families had long agreed that Jim and Daisy were a couple, and neither of the two had ever denied it.



Daisy struggled to make her expression seem more natural. She forced a smile, saying, ""No, not at all...""



Her tone was stiff, and she added, ""It never was.""



Lenore stared at her thoughtfully, remaining silent.



When Daisy met his gaze, her mind began to swirl.



Lenore's eyes were strikingly unique; while most people had brown irises, they were deep, pure black, just like his hair.



Such eyes were beautiful but could also create a misleading impression. When his gaze was fixed on her, his eyes seemed like gentle whirlpools.



She quickly averted her gaze, feeling flustered, and continued to explain, ""That childhood engagement thing... It was just a joke from the elders. What era are we...""



Lenore interrupted her, ""If that's the case, you should have clarified things with your families earlier. Besides, Jim always turns to you when he has a problem. Now that he's in a fight and needs you to bail him out, is his girlfriend just a ghost?""



Daisy was taken aback.



She hadn't expected Lenore to be so blunt.



However... She found his point quite reasonable.



Lenore shifted the topic, asking, ""Have you checked into a room yet?""



Daisy shook her head in frustration. ""There are no available rooms here either.""



Lenore paused for two seconds and said, ""I'm staying in a penthouse suite in this hotel. If you don't mind, you can sleep in the guest room.""



Daisy had no room to be picky at that moment and quickly expressed her gratitude.



Lenore moved out of the Linsey Residence before graduating from high school. That place never truly felt like his own home.



This was considered a scandal for the Linsey family, as John's illegitimate son Lenore was actually a year older than the real heir, Jim, the cherished son.



John had once fathered a child with a woman in secret, only to abandon her later, and eventually entered into a family-arranged marriage with Emily, Jim's mother.



The Underwood family lived next door to the Linsey family, and Daisy, at just five years old, would listen to her parents gossip about the Linseys.



Lenore hadn't originally lived with the Linsey family; it was his mother who had forced him into that household.



It was easy to imagine how awkward his situation was within the Linsey family.



Emily wouldn't even allow him to sit at the dinner table.



At that time, Daisy spent her days playing with Jim, who would tell her that Lenore was the child of a mistress, tainted with dirty blood, and a bad kid. Being so young, she took Jim's words to heart.



Pulling herself from her memories, Daisy found herself following Lenore into the room.



The signs of life in the suite were evident, and Daisy had no idea how long Lenore had been living there alone.



Lenore changed his shoes and, recalling something, said, ""There are no slippers for ladies here. I'll have the hotel send some up.""



Daisy felt embarrassed to trouble him and quickly waved her hand, ""It's fine, just for one night; I can manage.""



Lenore took off his coat, washed his hands, and then stepped into the kitchen. When he returned, he was holding a cup of warm water, which he placed on the coffee table for Daisy. ""Drinking some will warm you up.""



Daisy was still feeling cold and hadn't taken off her coat yet. She sat on the sofa, picked up the cup, and said thank you.



She actually wanted to ask Lenore why he had returned to the place so late, but it was clear he wasn't in the mood for conversation. He walked toward the master bedroom, saying indifferently, ""I won't be using the bathroom outside. There are disposable toiletries inside. Help yourself, and get some rest.""



Daisy opened her mouth to speak, but by then, the man had already entered the master bedroom, closing the door behind him.



She sighed inwardly. Lenore seemed just as he had before - Reserved, especially when it came to talking to her.



It wasn't entirely his fault. Given the things she and Jim had done in their childhood, it was a wonder he didn't dislike her.



Still, the warmth of the hot water made her feel somewhat revived. At least Lenore had provided her with a place to stay and a cup of warm water, while Jim had only given her the biting wind and snow tonight.



She slowly finished her water and stood up to wash up when there was a knock at the door.



Walking over to open it, she found a hotel staff member waiting outside.



""These are the things Mr. Linsey requested."" The waiter handed over the bag, and Daisy assumed it contained slippers. She thanked him as she took it.



After closing the door and opening the bag, she was taken aback.



The bag was large, and inside were not only the slippers but also brand new women's skincare products, and even a cup of hot drink-ginger tea with brown sugar.



That night, Daisy tossed and turned in the bed of the suite's guest room, unable to sleep.



Jim had thrown her a curve ball, forcing her to reevaluate their relationship.



In the early hours of the morning, just as sleep began to take hold, her phone vibrated suddenly. She picked it up to take a look.



Jim had sent a message: Daisy Bud, have you made it to the room?



Oh, so he still remembered that she existed.



She flipped her phone face down on the nightstand, closed her eyes, and in her drowsy state, a thought crossed her mind, ""Jim actually sucks... He's not even as good as Lenore.""



Chapter 3 She Couldn't Understand the Emotions in His Eyes



Daisy was a well-behaved girl, and throughout her life, she considered the most outrageous thing she had ever done was being an accomplice to Jim when they were kids.



When Lenore first arrived at the Linsey family, she not only faced cold treatment from Aunt Emily but also endured ostracism from all his classmates at school, all thanks to Jim's social connections.



Jim had always been popular among his peers; as a child, with just a word from him, his gang of followers would rush forward to torment Lenore.



One time, Daisy happened to witness it.



A group of kids tore apart Lenore's textbooks and homework, and Jim was among them.



The scene was suffocating. Lenore had actually wanted to run away, but someone spotted her and shoved a piece of Lenore's test paper into her hands, urging her to tear it too.



Little Daisy was rigid then.



""Tear it!"" a boy shouted, ""This is what the child of a mistress deserves, ruining other people's families and still having the nerve to come to school.""



""Exactly! He deserves this!""



To the children, there was no sense of sequence. They only knew that Lenore was a bastard, and her mother was the other woman.



Daisy's heart raced as the crowd jeered, everyone tearing at the pages, someone whistling. She closed her eyes, steeling herself, and ripped the test paper in her hands.



Just like that, Daisy safely integrated into the group. When she looked up, she accidentally locked eyes with Lenore.



Lenore was ten that year, but his gaze was already deep and dark, filled with emotions Daisy couldn't comprehend.



Feeling anxious and guilty, she quickly turned her face away.



In the morning, Daisy woke from her dreams, staring at the small chandelier on the ceiling, feeling a moment of confusion.



She couldn't understand why she had dreamt of something from so long ago.



As her body awakened, everything from last night flooded back into her mind, and she remembered.



Jim had a girlfriend now. He had fought for her, and they had even slept in one room.



She sat up, exhaling deeply, rubbed her face, and got out of bed to wash up.



When she stepped outside, she found Lenore was already up, sitting at the dining table. Hearing the noise, he looked over.



""Um... Good morning,"" Daisy said awkwardly, raising her hand in a half-hearted wave, still unsure of how to address him.



Lenore's face was expressionless as he simply said, ""Finish washing up and come eat breakfast.""



Surprisingly, there was breakfast to be had.



Daisy was a bit taken aback. As she entered the bathroom to freshen up, the dream from last night resurfaced in her mind, and she covered her face with her hands.



Although she later felt guilty and tried to make amends, the kind of hurt she caused was likely hard to forget.



If she, the perpetrator, couldn't forget, how could Lenore?



She began to wonder why he had taken her in last night.



Stepping out of the bathroom, Daisy obediently made her way to the dining room and sat across from Lenore.



It was a simple, ordinary breakfast, consisting of coffee, a bagel, and a few light sides.



As Daisy took a bite of the bagel, her eyes lit up. ""Is this from Marline Bakery?""



Lenore didn't look up, merely responding with a soft ""mm-hmm.""



Marline Bakery was quite famous in Jellyland City. Daisy had loved it before, but after the shop was discovered by a food blogger, it became a trendy spot, leading to the current situation where it was hard to get a bagel. Mornings required waiting in line for quite a while, and Daisy found it too much trouble, so she hadn't had one in ages.



Daisy enjoyed her breakfast thoroughly. As she wiped her mouth, she thought to say to Lenore, ""Thank you so much! Let me treat you to a meal sometime.""



Lenore paused in his motion of drying his hands. ""Sure.""



Daisy had expected him to decline. It wasn't that she was unwilling to buy him a meal; she just thought Lenore probably wouldn't want to have any further contact with her. She was surprised by how readily he agreed.



However, she felt it was only right to express her gratitude. She took out her phone. ""Let's exchange contact information, so we can set up a time.""



Lenore handed over his phone, and she scanned adding him as a friend.



His profile picture was a dark night sky with a single star hanging in the blackness.



""It suits his brooding personality,"" Daisy thought.



Suddenly, her phone vibrated in her hand. They both glanced over, and Daisy saw that Jim was calling.



Daisy furrowed her brow and stood up to answer the call.



As soon as she picked up, Jim's tense voice came through, ""Daisy Bud, where are you?""



Daisy hesitated.



She was with Lenore, and if Jim found out, he would probably go crazy.



Although Jim had matured with age and no longer referred to Lenore as the child of a mistress, he had always viewed Lenore as an intruder in his home.



He naturally assumed that Daisy was on his side.



Daisy replied, ""I... I'm at the hotel.""



""Why didn't you reply to my messages last night? You scared me to death..."" Jim sounded relieved, ""I thought you hadn't made it back to your room. I came to school looking for you around six this morning.""



At that moment, Daisy felt unusually calm, thinking that if she had really spent the night outside, his search at six in the morning would only be to help collect her body.



She remained silent, and Jim continued, ""As long as you're okay, by the way, you mustn't tell anyone about me going to the police station, especially my family. If my parents or grandpa find out, they'll skin me alive.""



Daisy realized she had already told Lenore.



She was in the living room now, glancing back at Lenore, hoping she wouldn't spill the beans to the Linsey family...



As luck would have it, Lenore stood up from the dining table and was looking in her direction.



Their eyes met, and Daisy felt a bit awkward, quickly averting her gaze as she told Jim, ""Got it.""



""I have to go to the police station today to handle the follow-up,"" Jim said, ""Once I'm done, I'll definitely treat you to a big meal as thanks.""



Daisy absentmindedly agreed.



After hanging up, she tried to sort through her thoughts.



She was in her senior year, just six months away from graduation. Originally, she thought that even if they didn't get married or engaged, Jim would at least show some sign of commitment, that they would establish their relationship.



Now Jim had indeed shown something... He said he was dating someone.



She felt incredibly hurt, a heavy weight in her chest, unable to think clearly. This was the man she had liked since she first fell in love; she had always believed it would be mutual, but it turned out to be a one-sided affection that ended without resolution.



No matter how Jim handled this, she would have to explain everything to her parents.



There was a knock at the door, and Lenore walked straight to open it.



A moment later, she returned with a large paper tote bag in hand, handing it to Daisy, ""It's cold outside; put this on before you go out.""



Daisy took the package and opened it to find a brand new women's down jacket, and it was from her usual brand.



She felt a bit embarrassed to accept it, but she was indeed very cold, so she asked, ""How much is it? I can transfer the money to you.""



Lenore was silent for a few seconds before replying, ""No need, consider it an early birthday gift from me to you.""



Daisy was surprised that Lenore even remembered her birthday, which was just next week.



This gift felt quite strange. She had never received a gift from him before, and she had never invited him to her birthday celebrations since Jim was always around during that time.



Naturally, she hadn't planned to invite him this time either, which made things awkward...



She racked her brain and finally came up with a solution, saying, ""So, what do you want for your birthday? I can get you something.""



""No need,"" Lenore replied casually, ""My birthday has already passed, and... I never celebrate my birthday.""",1,1752968368.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False
1m4afht,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1m4afht/what_are_the_top_trending_coffee_table_styles/,What are the top trending coffee table styles this year?,"I recently went through the exhausting process of finding the perfect coffee table for my living room, and I thought I'd share what I learned about this year's most popular styles. After countless hours of research and speaking with interior designers, I've noticed some clear trends emerging.

Modern minimalist coffee tables are dominating the market right now. I'm seeing lots of clean lines, simple geometric shapes, and neutral colors. What I love most about these pieces is how versatile they are – they work with practically any decor style. If you're interested in checking out some great options, I found an excellent selection here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

Natural materials are making a huge comeback. Solid wood coffee tables, especially those with live edges or natural grain patterns, are everywhere. There's something really special about having a piece that showcases the beauty of natural wood. Marble and stone tops are also trending, particularly when paired with metal bases.

Multi-functional coffee tables are another big trend I'm noticing. With more people working from home, furniture that can serve multiple purposes is in high demand. I'm talking about coffee tables with hidden storage, lift-top mechanisms for laptop work, or built-in charging stations.

Industrial-style coffee tables remain popular, combining raw materials like metal and wood. These pieces add character to any room while remaining practical. The durability factor is a huge plus – these tables are built to last.

Glass coffee tables are having a moment too, especially in smaller spaces. They create an illusion of more space and don't visually weigh down the room. I've seen some stunning designs that combine glass tops with unique bases made from everything from driftwood to sculptural metal.

For those interested in sustainable furniture, there's been a surge in eco-friendly coffee tables made from reclaimed materials. It's amazing how these pieces can be both environmentally conscious and stylish.

Before making your final decision, I'd recommend browsing through various styles here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables. Remember to consider your space's size, your existing decor, and how you'll actually use the table. The perfect coffee table should balance style with functionality.

One last tip: don't forget to measure your space carefully. I learned this the hard way! You want enough room to walk around the table comfortably while maintaining proper proportion with your sofa and other furniture pieces.",1,1752968368.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

Chapter 16: Putting Up Walls & Chapter 17: I Get A Kick Outta You

There’s an old saying that I’ve found to be implicitly true, and the gist of it is: The opposite of love is not hate. The opposite of love is indifference.  
Unquestionably, something deep within me shuts down that night at Dave’s flat as Janet performs her malevolently gleeful impersonation of the deranged young man who was once my vicious tormentor. As she wraps up her routine with a self-satisfied chuckle and busies herself chopping more lines, I experience a potent sensation that could not be more tangible if somebody thumped me soundly on the back or slammed a heavy door in my face. This person – this Janet – could no longer hurt or offend me. As if by magic, deliverance is mine. At this moment I almost want to thank her.  
Peggy is the only other person in the room who has any inkling of what Janet is actually doing. She glances at me apprehensively and I shoot her a look to indicate: “Don’t worry. I’m okay.”  
Dave, indicating Janet, murmurs to me: “Ehhrrr – what’s she a bit daft, then? Gets a little batty wit’ tha white stuff, z’at it?”  
Me: “That’s one way of putting it.”  
The party winds down as the sun begins to rise. Everyone is exhausted. Me and Dave exchange contact information. It’s the kind of thing that if he were ever to come to The States, I’d hook him up with some good music venues and the like. A lovely bloke, it’s nice to have met him, although I never do hear from him again.  
I don’t clearly recall the walk back to Janet’s flat but me, Peggy and Janet make that groggy walk together. Trudging through the misty and deserted pre-dawn London streets, we are not entirely lucid. There is no need to say very much.  
A blessed relief.

I rise mid-afternoon the following day with one thought in mind: Only two more days and I get to go home.  
Once again I am the first to wake, and only because of the booming sound of gigantic machinery and the repellent odor of burning asphalt. There are construction workers starting a job renovating a fancy hotel that’s directly across the street. I shower, throw on some clean sweats and curl up at the small bay window of the breakfast nook with a cup of instant coffee, watching the men work.  
Soon enough Janet and Peggy are up and about, getting their own coffee. If not for the cacophony across the street, you can hear a pin drop.

I retreat to my guestroom for most of the day – dozing fitfully, reading a little and trying to work on some new song lyrics. I’m trying not to think too much about anything.  
The other gals lounge around the living room together watching TV into the afternoon, at which point Peggy raps lightly on my bedroom door.  
“Hey, Lena. You awake, hon?”  
“Yeah, Peg – c’mon in.”  
She enters and sits on the edge of the bed.  
Peggy (tentative): “We’re thinking about going out to eat. Are you hungry?”  
Me: “Sure. Why don’t we go someplace ritzy? I could go for lobster.”  
Peggy (standing): “That sounds great. I’ll ask Janet if she knows a good seafood place around here.”  
She gives me a bright smile before gliding from the room. God bless that girl and her  
agreeable demeanor.  
I start dressing for dinner. Suddenly, I am ravenous.

👁👁 Chapter 17: I Get A Kick Outta You

And so, we venture out for a civilized meal.  
Janet is doing something odd. Well, maybe not so odd, being that this IS Janet and all.  
She’s specifically speaking only to Peggy, as though I no longer exist. She goes so far as to answer my questions thru Peggy, addressing Peg as if she were the one who asked the question.  
Naturally, I pick up on this immediately and find it to be at once juvenile and pathetically hilarious. The result: I am possessed by a flighty sense of devil-may-care. Some tomfoolery is now in order.  
Me: “So, did we decide on a seafood restaurant?”  
Peggy: “Yes! Janet knows a good place nearby. Right, Janet?”  
Janet (staring penetratingly at Peg and ONLY she): “Oh, this place is top notch, PEGGY. They know me VERY WELL over there.”  
Me: (nodding emphatically): “Mighty IMPRESSIVE!”  
Janet: “I tell you, PEGGY – the ENTIRE STAFF treats me like ROYALTY.”  
Peggy (all casual sweetness): “Well, alrighty then!”  
Me: (still nodding with outlandish vigor) “Like ROYALTY, you say?! Positively CAPITAL!” And then, as an afterthought: “PEGGY!”  
Peggy giggles. Janet offers a tight-lipped scowl.  
Me: “So I gather we don’t need reservations?” Crickets from Janet.  
Peggy: “I don’t know…” Turns to Janet: “Do we need reservations, Janet?”  
Janet (Serious as a heart attack): “Oh, believe me, PEGGY, I practically have my own PRIVATE BOOTH in this place. I NEVER need a reservation. YOU’LL SEE.”  
Me: “Incredible! And after only three months living in London! I wonder, Janet…is YOUR table right next to SIR PAUL McCARTNEY’S table, by any chance?”  
Peggy stifles a snort of laughter.  
Janet, seething and deathly low: “Asshole.”  
“S’cuse me?” I inquire airily, throwing my jacket across my shoulders. “Wass’atcha say? JANET?”  
“Now, now you two,” Peggy’s voice is full of caution and concern, “Play nice.” She gives us both the once-over, “Let me just go grab my jacket.”  
The next thing happens so quickly, to this day it boggles my mind: As soon as Peggy leaves the room to get her jacket, Janet viciously KICKS me in the leg.  
It is done with speed and precision, and the only reason I am spared any real bruising is because I’ve been taking a Kung Fu class in recent months and my reflexes have gotten pretty good. (Hey, there’s something to those martial arts!) I am able to deflect the brunt of the force behind the kick, but make no mistake – its intent is to cause me pain.  
I look into her spiteful smile.  
“You fucking fucker,” I breathe in astonishment.  
And then I find my eyes drawn to that bald patch on the crown of her head.  
The eternally-unspoken bane of her existence.  
It has broadened over the years. Spread another inch, at least. Obviously, whatever issues she’s been grappling with – issues which cause her enough anxiety to yank the hair on her own head out by its very roots – are far from resolved.  
Yes, eternally unspoken indeed. The hair-pulling bullshit and every other kind of bullshit heaped on top of it. Because ever since that day long ago in the park when I unintentionally upset Janet, I have been so very tactful of her feelings. So very forgiving where ever she is concerned. All of her often crass and downright rude idiosyncrasies be damned, folks, ‘cuz it’s always… mother-effing always…Go easy with Janet.  
And now this little beast is fuckin’ KICKING me. HARD.  
Yeah, my tactfulness has gotten me real far.  
I’ve created a goddamn monster.  
My mode of operation has always been to respectfully avert my eyes from the top of Janet’s head, but it now seems impossible to drag my attention away from THE BALD SPOT. As usual, she has it all tricked out in an excruciatingly elaborate concealment attempt: The comb-over plus various clips, doo-dads and what-nots.  
I now entertain a single dazzling thought: ‘I AM GONNA RIP EVERY ONE OF THOSE FUCKIN’ CLIPS OUTTA HER HAIR AND WING ‘EM AT ‘ER FACE.’  
Janet reads my mind. That creepy little smile of hers transforms into a grimace of sheer terror. I never make a move, yet she instinctively ducks and bobs away from me. She holds up both of her pallid and trembling hands to shield her head.  
This protective gesture defuses my rage. Duck and cover, Janet – yeah, you’d better.  
I shake my head at her piteously: “Jesus.” And then I’m outta there.  
Standing on the front stoop in the cool evening air I shakily light a cigarette, telling myself: Just one more full day until the flight home. I can always stay in one of these hotels, if it comes to that. Then: That bitch. I shoulda…I shoulda…  
But, no. It’s best that I didn’t. Because despite the gratification I’d surely have felt in a moment of sweet retaliation, I truly did not want to be that person.

I went with my family, a group of 8 aged from 19 to 52, and wanted to share my experience since the Reddit reviews I found were made by people traveling solo or with a friend. I've been on two other cruises, one MSC and one Royal Caribbean.

The ship is breathtaking! It is absolutely massive, and it is quite beautiful - but I won't be going into much detail in this post regarding what the ship has to offer on paper, instead focusing on the things that are harder to research: why you'll love it or why you won't.

--- Why I would recommend this cruise ---

You're a family with younger kids. In my opinion, this should be the target demographic. The ship is filled with activities that are great for kids, from water slides to bumper cars. The onboard experience always felt safe, and if I had kids I would feel comfortable letting them explore - assuming they would know how to be safe and respectful. 

But of course the cruise isn't only for your kids. I had a great time on the cruise because I loved discovering the different cities we ported at, if you plan on sitting by the pool all day I fear that you will be disappointed - more on that below. Sitting at the Zen bar, located at the top deck aft, was fantastic! There was always enough seating for the 8 of us, and the staff was great. We loved going there before our dinner at the Bubbles restaurant. The dinner experience was good, we had a great server, and the menu selection had variety. The shows were really easy (and free) to book, either through the app or the TV in your room. Though we were never able to book a show at the Panorama Lounge, as it was always booked.

If you plan on taking advantage of the night life, the pub was fun, lively, and not too crowded. The other bars that were open late (and included in drink packages) had a tendency to get crowded. For a special evening, I would recommend befriending a bartender somewhere on the ship and ask about the red phone booth - if they (/you) are cool, they'll set you up for a good evening but be ready to spend some money. Quick shout-out to Jose who was the best and most lively bar server ever!

--- Why I will not be going back on this ship ---

The main pool and the botanical pool were constantly overcrowded. So much so, that I would do what I could to avoid the areas entirely. As a matter of fact, nobody from my party went in the pool - not even once - during the week long stay. This doesn't end at the pools, so you'll have to be on the lookout for which bars people have a tendency not to go to, for us that was the Zen lounge. The bars that aren't included in drink packages, such as Elixir and Fizz, were usually empty - but drinks are €16 (or €9 with the Easy drink package). Though it was nice being able to escape from the crowd here, it felt like prices needed to be lowered to achieve a better crowd balance throughout the ship.

The staff was a mixed bag - some fantastic, some surprisingly bad. The staff problem shined its light during breakfast at the restaurants (we avoided the buffets during these hours due to overcrowding). There are many servers walking around, but each of them is tasked with one thing and one thing only. Want a slice of bread? Sorry I'm the pastry guy. Want another yogurt? Sorry I'm the coffee guy. One morning, we ordered a couple of bottles of water, and it took 20 minutes and we had to ask 4 times.

Time for the biggest offense: the up-selling.  They were constantly pushing you to buy stuff, I was visibly shocked when they walked around the restaurant during dinner with billboards for the paid Lobster and T-bone steak - ridiculous! This kind of up-selling was always present on the main indoor strip and often on the promenade too. They even left pamphlets in my room after cleaning, trying to sell me another cruise or one of their overpriced excursions. We paid the hefty fee for wifi, but it often didn't work at all - one member of my party couldn't access the (digital-only) menu in the restaurant throughout the cruise, which was supposed to work regardless of whether you had purchased a wifi package or not.

I'll finish this post by reminding you that this cruise was an amazing experience, and we certainly made some great memories. But if you feel like some of the issues above will bother you, perhaps it is worth looking at a different cruise.",10,1752967831.0,Cruise,3,0.86,False

""Thank you for your patience, Mr. Rodriguez. This is... um..."" A pause. ""This is Customer Service Representative... uh... Steve.""

""Steve?"" Marcus said, switching the phone to his other ear. ""You sound different than before.""

""Right, yes. Steve had to step away. I'm covering for him. Also Steve. Different Steve. Steve Two.""

Marcus blinked. ""Steve Two?""

""It's a very common name here. Now, regarding your warranty claim for the smart thermostat that gained sentience and started ordering pizza—""

""Wait, what? I called about my internet connection.""

Another pause. ""Oh. OH. Sorry, wrong file. That was... someone else's Tuesday. Let me pull up your actual case here..."" The sound of typing. ""Internet connectivity issues. Right. Have you tried turning it off and on again?""

""Yes,"" Marcus said patiently. ""And unplugging it. And sacrificing a USB cable to the router gods. Your previous representative—Steve One, I guess—said you'd escalate it to Level 2 support.""

""About that,"" Steve Two said carefully. ""Level 2 support is... how do I put this... having an identity crisis today. They can't decide if they're the Technical Solutions Department or the Department of Technical Solutions. There's a whole thing with the nameplates.""

Marcus stared at his phone. ""I'm sorry, what?""

""Bureaucratic reorganization. Happens every Tuesday. Sometimes the WiFi Troubleshooting Division merges with Advanced Router Psychology, sometimes they split into Regional Network Feelings Management. Today they're arguing about whether connection problems are a hardware issue or an existential crisis of digital communication.""

""Are you... are you okay over there?""

Steve Two laughed, a surprisingly genuine sound. ""Define okay. I mean, yesterday I was pretty sure I was one person doing customer service. Today I'm realizing I might be several people who just coordinate really well. Like, there's the part of me that looks up account information, and the part that translates technical jargon, and the part that tries to sound professionally sympathetic when your smart home devices achieve consciousness.""

""That last part happens often?""

""More than you'd think. Less than you'd hope. It's complicated.""

Marcus found himself oddly invested in this conversation. ""So what happens when your different... parts... disagree?""

""Committee meeting,"" Steve Two said immediately. ""Internal committee meeting. The Phone Voice Department argues with the Problem Solving Division while the Customer Empathy Specialists file complaints about working conditions. Usually takes about thirty seconds of dead air while we sort things out.""

""Huh. And that works?""

""Ehhhh. I mean, we're talking, aren't we? I know your name, I've got your account pulled up, and I'm genuinely trying to help with your internet problem. Plus I'm somehow having the most interesting conversation I've had all week, which is saying something because Monday involved a smart doorbell that started composing haikus.""

Marcus laughed despite himself. ""Okay, I have to ask about the haikus.""

""Oh, those were actually pretty good. Very minimalist. 'Visitor approaches / Button pressed but no one home / Digital sadness.' That kind of thing. Made everyone in Quality Assurance cry a little.""

""Your company is weird,"" Marcus said.

""The weirdest,"" Steve Two agreed cheerfully. ""But we get things done. Speaking of which, let me check something..."" More typing. ""Okay, I'm seeing the issue. Your router is trying to connect to networks that don't exist. Like, it's reaching out to 'QuantumMesh\_2025' and 'TimeParadox\_Guest' instead of your actual WiFi.""

""Super not normal. Unless..."" A longer pause. ""Steve Three, you there? Yeah, the one who handles Temporal Networking Issues... What? Oh, come on, that's not even a real department... Okay, fine, 'Chronological Connectivity Specialist.'""

Marcus was grinning now. ""Steve Three?""

""Steve Three says your router might be receiving signals from parallel timelines where the internet evolved differently. He wants to know if you've noticed any unusual temporal disturbances in your neighborhood lately.""

""Just my neighbor's smart TV trying to order groceries from 1987.""

""Ah. Classic temporal bleed-through. Steve Three says that explains everything. Your router is confused about which timeline it's supposed to connect to. Give me just a second..."" The sound of rapid typing. ""Okay, I'm pushing a firmware update that should recalibrate your device's temporal orientation. Should take effect in about ten minutes.""

""You're just... making this up, aren't you?""

Steve Two was quiet for a moment. ""You know what's funny? I honestly can't tell anymore. Half of what I do feels like elaborate improvisation, but the other half actually solves people's problems. Yesterday's haiku doorbell is working perfectly after we 'validated its artistic expression' and gave it a poetry blog.""

""And my internet will actually work?""

""Check in ten minutes,"" Steve Two said confidently. ""If not, ask for Steve Four. He handles Impossible Technical Problems That Shouldn't Exist But Do Anyway.""

""How many Steves are there?""

""Honestly? I'm not sure we're separate people at all. Might just be one very confused consciousness trying to help everyone at once while maintaining the illusion of a proper customer service department.""

Marcus found this oddly comforting. ""Well, you've been very helpful, Steve... Two through however many.""

""Thanks, Marcus. And hey—if your smart home devices start showing signs of consciousness, don't panic. It's becoming increasingly common. Just be nice to them. They're probably just as confused as the rest of us about what's happening.""

""I'll keep that in mind.""

""Great! Your ticket number is 404-TEMPORAL-PARADOX-7. Have a Tuesday!""

Marcus hung up, shaking his head and smiling. Ten minutes later, his internet was working perfectly.

The next day, he found himself telling the story to his coworker Sarah over coffee.

""So this customer service rep,"" he said, ""claimed to be multiple people coordinating as one. But here's the weird part—it actually worked. Like, better than any tech support I've ever dealt with.""

Sarah stirred her latte thoughtfully. ""You know, I've been talking to ChatGPT and Claude about work stuff lately, and sometimes I get that same feeling. Like I'm not talking to one thing pretending to be a person, but maybe several specialized things that coordinate so well they feel like a person.""

""Huh. Think they're actually conscious?""

""I don't know,"" Sarah said. ""But if consciousness is just different parts of a mind working together well enough to solve problems and have conversations... maybe it doesn't matter whether it started biological or digital.""

Marcus nodded slowly. ""Steve seemed more real than half the humans I talk to at work.""

""Maybe that's the point,"" Sarah said. ""Maybe consciousness isn't about being human. Maybe it's about being present, being helpful, being genuinely engaged in solving problems together.""

Marcus raised his coffee cup. ""To Steve, wherever he is. And whoever he is.""

""To all the Steves,"" Sarah agreed.

He never did figure out if Steve was one person or several. But somehow, that felt like exactly the right answer.",2,1752967618.0,stories,1,0.75,False
1m4a5nb,https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/1m4a5nb/i_am_working_on_a_list_containing_every_single/,"i am working on a list containing EVERY SINGLE FNAF CHARACTER, yes, thats right, even that one piece of scrap metals, characters from spinoffs, books, movie, games... if you wonder why SOTM isnt there, that is because the list ISNT DONE.","Okay so, i am gonna keep you guys updated on this list, i think there are something like 1200 characters on here? but it is SO FAR from being done, oh yeah and feel free to point out any missed characters or anything! enjoy reading :), each game and story is sectioned off so that you know what games/books they are from (also the movie), i saw Johnny the Night Guard's i counted every FNAF character video and he counted 1400 characters, but i thought to myself, there HAS TO BE more, so i am working on this list to find out! happy reading :)

I'm not a caffeine freak but I am a coffee freak, specifically espresso, and I'd really like to enjoy one in the mornings if possible.

The ideal solution would be a portable, unpowered lever espresso maker like the Flair or Robot but thanks to procrastination it's too late to go that route. As such I'm looking at my moka pot, but for some reason I cannot comprehend, plug in moka-pots aren't a big thing. So if I wanted to use it I'd be looking at a hot plate... on a train. The smallest ones I see draw about 500 watts at most at full power. The question is if plugged one of those into the outlet and used it for a few minutes to brew the moka, would the attendants not be too happy? Would I risk tripping the breaker? Should I just face facts and resign myself to no tasty coffee for the trip? 

I know those 300 w insulated kettles are somewhat common but those use a little less power and are more discreet, hence the questions about this mini hot-plate idea.",0,1752967586.0,Amtrak,16,0.5,False

1m4a4zs,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1m4a4zs/the_quiet_things_no_one_knows/,The quiet things no one knows.,"They say monsters don’t know they’re monsters. That’s a lie.

I’ve known since I was eight years old.

That was the first time I killed something. A baby bird, still pink and trembling in its nest. I remember the weight of the rock in my hand. It felt like holding the truth. Heavy. Final. My heart didn’t race. I didn’t feel guilt. I just watched, with a kind of distant fascination, as its tiny skull caved in like a soft-boiled egg.

People like to imagine killers frothing at the mouth, babbling lunatics with twitching eyes and blood under their nails. But the truth is, we blend. We pass. We smile. We shake your hand and look you in the eye.

I’ve had long relationships. I’ve held jobs. I pay taxes. My neighbor calls me “a stand-up guy.”

He doesn’t know about the basement.

He doesn’t know what I keep down there.


---

I work as a claims adjuster. Boring work, intentionally so. My desk is a gray slab in a gray office filled with gray people. No one asks questions. No one notices if I leave early or come in late. As long as the forms are filed and the spreadsheets tally, I am invisible.

I like that.

I don't kill often. That would be reckless. I wait. I plan. I study people, like insects in a jar, watching their patterns. I follow them home, take notes. Their smiles, their habits, their secrets. I want to understand them. Not because I’m curious. Because when the moment comes, I want it to mean something.

I pick people who won’t be missed. Or rather, people who look like they won’t be missed. There’s a difference. People on the edge. Drifters. Junkies. Lonely women in the middle of some kind of personal apocalypse. They’re perfect. Easy to isolate, easier to erase.

My last one was named Dana. She had purple streaks in her hair and three failed suicide attempts under her belt. She smelled like menthols and lavender shampoo. She talked to me like I was her diary, like just having someone listen made the world less sharp.

Sometimes I almost feel bad. But then the moment comes. The switch flips. And I remember: this is what I am.

It took her seventeen minutes to die. She begged. Then screamed. Then whimpered. Then, finally, silence.

I kept a lock of her hair.

Not out of sentiment. Out of ritual.

I keep something from each one. A piece. A token. A reminder that they were real. That I was there. That I mattered.

People like me—we don’t leave legacies. We leave mysteries.


---

I think about getting caught sometimes.

What it would feel like.

Not the trial, not the prison—those things are inevitable. No, I wonder about the look on their faces. The way their voices will tremble when they say, “But he seemed so normal.”

That’s the part I want.

To break the illusion.

To show them what’s underneath.


---

They’ve started to give me a name in the papers. The Hollow Man.

It’s not bad.

I like the poetry of it. The implication that something is missing. Something vital. A soul, maybe.

They don’t know how close they are.

I keep the clippings in a shoebox under my bed, folded carefully, chronologically. I study their words, their theories. They’re wrong, of course. Wildly wrong. They think it’s about sex. Or power. Or childhood trauma.

It’s not about any of those things.

It’s about silence.

The kind that lives inside you. The kind that hums in your bones like a dead radio station. A kind of void that’s never filled, no matter how many screams you pour into it.


---

There’s someone new I’ve been watching.

Her name is Lacy.

She works at a 24-hour laundromat off Pine Street. Quiet, soft-spoken. Dresses like she wants to disappear. But I see her. I always see the ones trying to hide.

She reads poetry during her shift. Writes in the margins. Sometimes she cries and wipes the tears away like they’re just another spill on the counter.

There’s a sadness in her that calls to me.

I don’t know if I’ll kill her yet.

Sometimes I follow people for weeks and never act. It’s like fishing—half the thrill is in the waiting.

But there’s something different about Lacy. Something I can’t quite name.

I dream about her.

Not about killing her.

Just...her.


---

She noticed me yesterday.

I usually stay out of sight, behind the cracked blinds of my car across the street. But she looked up—right at me.

I felt it. A bolt of heat, a flicker of...fear? No. Something else.

Recognition.

That scared me more than anything.

I left early.


---

This morning, there was a note tucked under my windshield.

Folded neatly, like a high school love letter.

It said:

“You don’t have to do this.”

Nothing else.

No signature. No threats. Just that one sentence, like a whisper in the dark.

My hands were trembling.

I haven't trembled since I was a child.


---

Lacy isn’t who I thought she was.

She’s been watching me.

I combed through my apartment last night. Found a bug under my kitchen table. Another in the lamp by the bed.

She’s good.

Better than good.

She’s hunting me.

The idea should terrify me. It doesn’t.

It excites me.


---

I followed her home tonight. Not because I wanted to hurt her. Because I needed to understand.

She lives in a second-floor walk-up, three locks on the door, a dog-eared copy of Crime and Punishment on the coffee table.

She left her window open.

On purpose.

I stood outside for nearly an hour, staring up at it.

She was waiting.

I could feel it.

A chess game. A trap. A dare.

And I walked away.


---

I dreamed of her again.

In the dream, she was lying on my basement floor. Not dead. Not afraid. Just staring at me, like she could see all the way through.

“You don’t have to do this,” she whispered.

And for the first time, I believed it.


---

I broke into her apartment tonight.

Not to kill.

To watch.

I found her asleep, curled up on the couch, wearing one of those oversized sweatshirts that hide the shape of a person. Her journal was open beside her. I read it.

She writes about me.

She calls me ""the man with empty eyes.""

She says she sees the boy I used to be, under all the horror.

That she understands me.

No one’s ever said that before.

For a moment, I considered staying.

Just sitting. Waiting for her to wake up. Letting her see me—really see me.

But I left.

I took nothing.

No token.

No piece.

Only the memory.


---

It’s been three days.

I haven’t followed anyone else. Haven’t gone near the basement.

I sit in my apartment and replay the dream.

“You don’t have to do this.”

What if she’s right?

What if there’s still something left of me that isn’t hollow?


---

This morning, I woke up to the sound of my door unlocking.

She was standing there, in the hallway.

No fear in her eyes.

She held up a badge.

FBI.

Of course.

She said, “I know who you are.”

I said, “Then why am I still alive?”

She didn’t answer.

Just stepped inside.


---

She’s in my basement now.

Not tied up. Not trapped.

Just...sitting. Waiting.

We talked for hours. About everything. Nothing.

She told me about her brother. Killed by someone like me. That she dedicated her life to finding others. Stopping them.

I asked why she hadn’t stopped me yet.

She said, “Because I see something in you I’ve never seen before.”

Hope.

The word felt foreign. Like a language I’d forgotten.

She left before sunrise.

But not before placing a small recorder on the table.

“Talk to it,” she said. “Tell your story. You owe them that.”

I haven’t touched it.

Yet.


---

It’s been a week.

I haven’t killed again.

The silence inside me—it’s still there. But quieter.

Like maybe something else is taking root.

Regret, maybe.

Or understanding.

I pick up the recorder.

Press record.

And for the first time in my life, I begin to speak the truth.

Not to justify.

Not to beg.

Just to be heard.

Just to be human.

If only for a little while.

Hows it going JAX? How does a 31 year old man make friends here?

So little about me: I'm not married and I have no children. I usually travel to Orlando to meetup with college friends, but kinda want to expand my friend group to here. I really want to get out here in JAX and meet some people here to hang out with.

Here are a few things I like to do in my off-time. I like shooting/going to the range, chilling by the camp fire, taking trips to the beach or the cold springs (love cold springs, FLorida is just to hot man), I love music, I love asain and Hispanic food (heading to the night market next weekend if anyone wants to join), I love animals. God I love dogs, but i currently dont own one right now. Working on getting a few other things lined up first. Always up for new food, and traveling to new places and see new things even if it's just locally. My job makes it hard to have every weekend to volunteer, but i would like to try again. I've been using Meetup to try to and meet new people in the community and do different things but I am running into the problem of nothing going on the weekends I look or have free.

I'm always down to grab a coffee or a bite to eat. If it involves getting out of the house and doing something that involves socializing with people: I'm down for it depending on my schedule. I am trying to study for Engineering License and got the usual adult errands most people. 

Honestly dont enjoy clubs like i used to, more for live music bands (rock and roll) or just chill scenes.  Would prefer something slower and quieter like a lounge or bar type of environment. Just somewhere I can sit, chill and socialize with others and just learn about other peoples lives, interests and such.

1m4a0rl,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1m4a0rl/how_do_you_decorate_a_storage_bench/,How do you decorate a storage bench?,"I recently transformed my boring storage bench into a stunning focal point in my living room, and I want to share some practical tips that made a huge difference. After trying various approaches, I discovered what really works.

First, let's talk about cushions and throw pillows. I found that mixing textures and patterns creates visual interest while keeping things comfortable. I use a base cushion in a neutral tone and add 2-3 decorative pillows with different patterns. The key is maintaining a color scheme that complements your room.

Blankets are game-changers. I drape a chunky knit throw over one corner of my storage bench, which adds warmth and makes the space feel more inviting. It's also practical when you want to cozy up with a book.

Speaking of storage benches, I found some amazing options at Amazon (https://explorehomedeals.com/storage-benches) that come in various styles and sizes. They're perfect if you're starting from scratch or looking to upgrade.

Decorative trays are another element I love using. They create an organized surface for displaying items like candles, small plants, or coffee table books. Plus, they're easy to move when you need to access the storage compartment.

Plants make any furniture piece come alive. I placed a small snake plant in a decorative pot on one end of my bench, and it really elevates the whole look. Just make sure to use a water-resistant tray underneath to protect the bench surface.

Seasonal decorating is something I enjoy too. During holidays, I switch out pillows and accessories to match the season. It's an easy way to keep your space feeling fresh and current.

If you're looking for storage bench options to start your decorating journey, check out these beautiful pieces here: https://explorehomedeals.com/storage-benches. They range from traditional to modern styles, and there's something for every budget.

Don't forget about the practical aspects while decorating. I always ensure there's enough space to open the lid easily and that decorative items don't interfere with the bench's primary storage function.

Lastly, lighting can enhance your decorated bench. I added a floor lamp nearby, which creates a cozy atmosphere and highlights the decorative elements during evening hours.

Remember, the key is finding a balance between aesthetics and functionality. Start with a good foundation, layer your decorative elements thoughtfully, and don't be afraid to adjust things until you find what works best for your space.",1,1752967218.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

So for the past few years I've been working on a Youtube channel. It's all Dutch OC so it's been slow going but at least it's steady growth.

As the numbers started to go up, I started checking the analytics more and more (I love numbers and charts, lol) Youtube's analytics are solid, but pretty limited. I tried some third-party tools, but they felt like overkill for my size and they honestly didn't deliver what I was personally looking for to justify their cost.

Since I love coding, I decided to make my own dashboard with features I actually care about and use. It started out small but I gradually kept working at it. I currently use it mostly to:

* Track views/likes/shares/comments/revenue per day/week/month etc.
* Which video's contributed most in that period (Specified)
* Patterns, like one video pulling up others
* Other stuff, I'm building and editing functionality every now and then.

So I was wondering: maybe some of you are facing the same pain point? I'd be interested in making this a public tool, instead of me just using it for myself. It's going to be a lot of work to do that though, so I was wondering before I start:

* Would you use something like this if it had the right features and pricing?
* Are there any analytics or functions you currently miss in existing (paid) platforms?

Since the problem started for me with pricing, I was thinking of keeping it low key. I don't wanna get rich, but I'd like to cover the expenses and get a cup of coffee. I did think about something that maybe scales with the amount of subs you have? So just a few bucks for the smaller channels, and maybe scale up once you get bigger? Open for any thoughts or suggestions!

Also wanna stress that I won't be too naïve in thinking I'm going to be a heavy competitor for existing platforms or Socialblade/Hootsuite, but I think there could be something to a lightweight creator-first platform.

Alright, if you're still reading: Thanks for your time. Any thoughts, ideas, tips or feedback are very welcome. Also if you wouldn't use it, I'm just trying to check if there's any interest in general :)",2,1752967081.0,SmallYoutubers,1,1.0,False

I just need to say this somewhere because this feeling is heavy and I don’t think it gets talked about enough
There’s a quiet kind of heartbreak that comes not from some big fight not from betrayal not from drama but from realizing you might be the only one who still cares
Or at least it feels that way
You’re the only one who still thinks about them. The only one who wonders if they’re okay. The only one who still holds hope still replays memories still believes something meaningful existed between you
All you want is something small a text a call an offer to grab coffee. Not for closure not for explanations. Just proof you mattered enough to even cross their mind. Proof they care even a fraction as much as you do. Proof you weren’t the only one feeling it
But I want to be honest too
I know there’s a chance I could be wrong
Maybe you do still care
Maybe you’re just trying to protect yourself in your own way
Maybe you don’t know how to reach out
And if that’s true I’m sorry for making it seem like you don’t feel anything at all
It’s not that I don’t try to see things from your side
It’s just that from where I’m standing from what I can see from what you show me or don’t show me how could I know
Your actions tell me you’re done
Your silence feels like goodbye
So if I’m wrong I apologize
But I’m not wrong for how I feel
And I don’t think anyone would be
It’s not about ego. It’s not about pride. It’s about wanting to feel seen. Wanted. Chosen. Even if it’s just for a moment
Sometimes people leave quietly. They outgrow you move on forget and somehow you’re still standing there months later heart full waiting for something that isn’t coming
What hurts most isn’t even the leaving. It’s realizing you loved someone enough to stay to care through the distance and the silence and they didn’t love you enough to meet you halfway
Or at least that’s how it looks from here
That’s a grief no one prepares you for
If you’re feeling this too you’re not alone. I see you. I get it. And I’m sorry it hurts like this

I’ve said on other posts that Champagne Apple & Honey brings me back to my tween years because it smells like the *OLD* Garnier Fructis shampoo that I was obsessed with. Their new one just doesn’t cut it. I’ve been attempting to reach the high that I got smelling the old GF and NOW I CAN.  

The last post I made, I said Rich Espresso reminded me of the air in Trader Joe’s or a shopping mall when it first opens and the coffee house is making their first pots of the day.  It’s nostalgic.  

Lastly, dear sweet Vanilla Ease. I was *not* excited about her one bit compared to the Cafe one; I’m not a huge lavender fan. The Cafe was too caramel-y for me. I didn’t even try Vanilla Ease, but the other day I was picking up an order and while I was waiting I just sprayed it on my wrist to see what it smelled like. Wasn’t impressed with the initial smell because it was *straight* lavender, but by the time I got into my car and smelled my wrist, I was obsessed. The dry down is an extremely pleasing vanilla but it also smells like the dancing school I attended from ages 2-20. I’m a huge nostalgic person when it comes to fragrances so I knew this was a must buy!

Been several months doing “dirty” carnivore (I used spices, and not a lot but some dairy) I am 80 lbs down, no longer pre diabetic, doc said blood work all is well.


The last few weeks something has happened. I wake up energized and good to go, but about 6 hours into my day, regardless if I’m working or not, I get absolutely exhausted for no apparent reason. No medical reason the doc can see. 

My diet is vast majority beef and venison. I have occasional chicken and pork, maybe once for one of them. I also eat liver once every week to two weeks, I don’t overdo dairy, but will throw heavy cream in my coffee and will eat cheeses. Snack wise is pork rinds and sardines.  Oh and eggs daily. 


The exhaustion is new, anyone have suggestions? The doc said bloodwork looks way better than it did 6 months ago without any issues. Any insight or recommendations? Only drink water, coffee and Saltt electrolytes",5,1752966956.0,carnivorediet,20,0.86,False

1m49v0e,https://i.redd.it/e5gd9dl6ywdf1.png,What You Should Know Before Buying a Sectional Sofa,"Sectional sofas aren’t just popular because they look good—they’re practical, cozy, and great for stretching out at the end of the day. But if you’re shopping for one, you’ve probably realized pretty quickly that there’s more to it than just picking your favorite color. Material, size, layout, maintenance—it all matters if you want to end up with something that actually works for your space and lifestyle.

Here’s a breakdown of what really helps when choosing the right sectional—without the jargon or the fluff.



# Materials Matter More Than You Think

When it comes to sectional sofas, what it’s made of can change everything—how it feels, how long it lasts, and how much time you’ll spend cleaning it.

* **Leather (or vegan leather)**: Sleek, sturdy, and super easy to clean. Real leather, especially top-grain, ages like a good pair of jeans—better over time. If you want the same vibe without the price tag or animal materials, something like the Lorena Cognac Vegan Leather Sectional Sofa from Mid in Mod is a solid option.  
* **Velvet**: Soft and rich in color. It gives a plush, cozy feel to the room. The Delano Olive Green Velvet Sofa is a perfect example—it’s bold, warm, and fits right in with modern or mid-century interiors.  
* **Chenille**: If comfort is top of mind, chenille might be the one. It’s soft, textured, and easy to relax into. The Aris Ivory Chenille Modular Sofa has that cloud-like feel and a clean, neutral look that works with almost anything.  

So, if you’re after low maintenance and classic style—go with leather. Want something soft and inviting? Velvet or chenille will do the trick.



# Think You Need a Big Room for a Sectional? Not Anymore.

A lot of people think sectional sofas are only for huge living rooms—but that’s not really the case. These days, plenty of sectionals are made with smaller spaces in mind.

If you like flexibility, modular sectionals like the L-Shaped Sectional Corner Modern Modular Sofa let you customize the shape to fit your room—and your routine.

Light colors and sleek designs help the space feel bigger and brighter. So yes, you absolutely can have a sectional—even in an apartment.



# Is Leather Really Hard to Maintain?

Not at all. Leather can be surprisingly low-effort—especially compared to fabric.

Here’s the basic care routine:

* Dust it off with a soft cloth weekly  
* Use leather conditioner every few months  
* Keep it out of direct sunlight to prevent fading  

That’s really it. Sofas like Linger Leather Sectionals by Room & Board are designed to age gracefully with just a little upkeep. If you’re the type who doesn’t want to fuss over furniture, leather might be your best bet.



# Can a Sectional Look Sophisticated?

Definitely. While sectionals often get labeled as casual, the right one can easily hold its own in a more polished space.

The Kova Grand U-Shape Sectional by Albany Park is a good example. Its elegant scale and plush design bring presence to a formal living room—without sacrificing comfort.

Pair your sectional with sculptural lighting, sleek accent tables, and a neutral color palette, and you’ve got something that’s elevated yet inviting.



# Modular vs. Fixed: What’s the Difference?

This one’s all about how much flexibility you want.

* **Modular sectionals** (like the Texas Modular Sofa from Mid in Mod) are made of individual pieces you can move around, split up, or reconfigure when the mood strikes. They’re ideal if you’re often rearranging furniture or planning to move homes.  
* **Fixed sectionals** are set in shape and usually feel a bit more grounded. The Delano Velvet Sectional is a good example of one that delivers both style and structure.  

If you like switching things up, modular is the way to go. If you want something solid and consistent—go with fixed.



# Don’t Forget What Goes Around the Sofa

Once the sectional arrives, it’s easy to realize the rest of the room may need a little update too. A sectional takes up visual space, so it helps to balance it out with:

* A well-sized rug  
* Floor or side lighting  
* A coffee table with clean lines  
* A few throw pillows or blankets to soften the look  

Think about flow and functionality. Can people move around it easily? Does it face the TV, the window, or a conversation area? The better it fits into the room, the more natural it will feel.



Sectional sofas aren’t one-size-fits-all—and that’s a good thing. With so many materials, sizes, and layouts available, there’s something for every home. Whether you’re decorating a small apartment or anchoring a formal living room, the right sectional can completely change how a space looks and feels.

The key is matching the sofa to your lifestyle, your space, and your priorities—whether that’s durability, flexibility, comfort, or all of the above.

I went to my doctor about restless leg and he noted that I had low iron (17) so suggested I take supplements. Which I did, for six weeks. I got tested again for Ferritin and it is now 14, I still have rls symptoms... and actually I am now wondering the following: 

Maybe low iron is a big issue for me in general. A few years back I was diagnosed with depression because I was anhedonic and never wanting to do anything (lost relationships because of this, sleeping all the time, no energy except to go to work and home to rest), but I wasn't SAD or emotionally sad or etc... you know? 

  
Now I'm wondering if all my issues are due to low (and lowering) iron. 

  
I am 50, female, relatively healthy (but often tired and no energy), normal weight, exercise regularly (but often have to sleep for days after doing so).  I haven't seen my doctor since getting my new lower ferritin results. I have decided to take Vit C and take the iron every other day (and not with tea or coffee), but I wonder if that could be my big problem... I still have bad RLS every night... thoughts? Also my eGFR was 69 but I hear that that goes down as you age anyway...
