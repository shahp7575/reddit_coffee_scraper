I'm also going to try and start drinking espresso again hopefully that helps. This semester is going to be the climax of my time in college, I have to deal with transferring and trying to get an internship for this and next summer, and all of my extracurriculars. Once I transfer its going to be smooth sailing, hopefully. This is more of a rant but I still want to know if I can use a mix of coffee and Vyvanse to eliminate my ADHD. 

Ideally, I go full robot mode and wake up at the end of the semester with an offer letter from Morgan Stanley and a 4.0. I want people to call me ""Da Machine"" and I don't even process it because I'm so cracked out on stimulants, I want to be like that scene of Quicksilver from Xmen where he is running around saving everyone while they are basically frozen because he's moving so fast, or like that episode of Futurama where Fry drinks 1000 cups of coffee and saves everyone from a fire in a similar fashion. Freezing cold fingers, zero appetite, no emotions but work. Also on that note does anybody know if some coffee has more caffeine than others, last semester I had to make about 6-8 shots of espresso every day which was very time-consuming, It would be much easier to make 2-4 and just add water or something. I'm considering switching to energy drinks so I don't have to worry about the coffee staining my teeth but I think that would be much more expensive and I can't really afford that. Tips, Tricks, and internships are appreciated. ",1,1737842934.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

What do I do?,"I cant believe I am writing this or in this position but I dont know what to do or who to go to. My parents have been married for 44 years. I (29 female) am 1 of 5 and have always had an amazing relationship with my dad. In my eyes, my parents were the perfect couple. obviously flawed but have always had a strong foundation. Like I mentioned before I have ALWAYS been a daddies girl. I played basketball just like my dad so we both connected on that. My mom and I didn't really have a close bond up until my late 20's but as I have gotten closer to her I have realized how amazing and strong she is.

Last year my mom and I started having weekly coffee dates. On one of our coffee dates she drops a bomb on me. She told me my dad had cheated on her when I was a couple months old. He confessed to her years later. She forgave him and said they were able to move past it. Hearing this crushed me also knowing I was the only one of my siblings to know this information left me in a really dark place. But if my mom was able to forgive him I thought I would try my best to do so also. He's a great father and has always been there for me and my siblings. I thought I was past it, I wasn't constantly thinking about it and started looking at him the same way I did before I found out.

A couple weeks ago his phone wasn't working and because he's on my family plan I told him I would call our provider. I ended up just logging into the app and was helped there. While trying to get familiar with the app I ended up on his text and call records and found he is a constant communication with a number I was not familiar with. (My dad doesn't have many friends outside of family, he works with my mom and his daily routine is work and home) I ended up calling the number and found it was a lady that works next to him. I had a weird a feeling, I discreetly asked my mom about this lady and was told they don't socialize or talk to her much. so my mom has no idea how often or how much they were talking. In a why I didn't want to know but I couldn't stop thinking about it. Just the thought would make me sick to my stomach. I ended up logging into to his imessage and found a message thread of him asking an other lady( different number) out to dinner or shopping. I know i was probably in the wrong for invading his privacy but I needed to put my mind at ease. My biggest fear is now a reality. and now there is two ladies he's chatting with.

I’m genuinely interested in getting to know a new person, I’m kinda very good looking (but that’s nothing very special I would say over here, I’m living in the capital in one of the country up north Europe), I would say I look a bit like girl from instagram who’s short, fit, smiley, bit sexy you name it, but not something over the top just normal girl in late twenties. I can maintain the conversation, I’m funny and being an interested person just to talk to or text. Why am I coming here is question: What is the thing guys really expect from us on the first date? Also what do you expect from us on early stage talking phase? I’m neurodivergent as well so maybe that’s why it’s not that obvious for me. I have an observation that it doesn’t really matter what will I say and how will I behave the guy would do whatever he feels like and how would I present myself doesn’t really matter. I mean I would be having very good conversations and ending up being ghosted or like having a nice talk at the first date and didn’t really know what’s next or feeling average but having a guy to be like totally invested going forward (even if he’s lacking the knowledge how to do it). In my previous relationship my bf complained that I was not appreciating him and his appearance with words enough so I kinda wanted to take my lesson from that and now I’m talking openly and addressing that I’m very impressed by someone’s accomplishments that they would mention or I know of or I would be flirting more directly but I feel like it scares guys away a bit and they got a bit intimidated? Well it’s opposite of what is my goal of saying that and it’s hard for me to understand that someone was interested enough to reach out but getting a step back after because I’m interested as well? I don’t know, it’s very confusing to me and I feel like it’s the most confusing when it comes to guys on the same age as I am and in general the better someone is looking and presenting himself in the internet the conversation is worse. What do you guys think? Because I feel like I overthink it too much and I should just be showing up looking cute and that would be enough or should I just talk about myself? Thanks!

1i9y95z,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1i9y95z/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

I don't plan on charring the wood too deep, only until the surface is fully black, after which I'll brush it off and finish it with either some linseed or Danish oil (any advice as to which one would also be very appreciated.)

She is a young lab mix that's around 45 pounds, she's been here for about 2 and a half months and should be going home by next weekend. Cup has been fine with my parents dog the entire time shes been here up until about two weeks ago. He suddenly starting attacking her for no reason, going out of his way to do so. And it's definitely not playful, it's angry meows and hissing and swatting. At first I thought its because she is more active now but he's even doing it for no reason, like when she's just sleeping and he walks by her. I still just assumed it was because he just associates her with her chaotic running around my coffee table. 
More recently he has started hissing and angry meowing at my boyfriend when he is here. Now this is very odd because he absolutely loves my boyfriend(more than me lol) and he's known him his entire life as well. Cup has never actually swatted at him though. He has never attacked or hissed at me or my pomeranian. I have taken him to the vet because i was worried something was medically wrong but they found nothing wrong with him after blood work and a physical exam. 
So my question is, could he just be so stressed from my parents dog that he's attacked anything or anyone that doesn't live in the house? She will be gone in less than i week and I've been making sure she isn't too wild in the house now but I'm just worried there could be something else going on.

1i9y2tc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1i9y2tc/aio_weird_roommate_situation/,AIO? Weird Roommate Situation,"Can someone tell me what might be happening with my roommate and if I'm overreacting to her behavior?

I have two roommates, roommate A who I share a room with and absolutely love. There's also roommate B (randomly assigned through uni) who has her own room and has been acting strangely since we all moved in to our little apartment.

We're one semester in and entering our second. Yes, we have an RA and I have tried to contact her about this but she's been generally uncooperative (both RA and B).

Here are some occurrences since moving in:

1. B moved in before A and I did, and we found food on the ground, and toenail clippings in the couch. Food (crumbs, yogurt, etc), hair, nails (clippings and gels I think?), and a number of other things have been found on the floor, wedged into and smudged into the couch/tables/chairs/floor over the course of the last semester. She had never made an effort to clean any of this unless asked about it.

2. On a similar note, dishes. Dirty mugs, plates, pots, and pans will sit in the sink, stove, on communal tables and counters for days (7-8 days has been the maximum so far). One time she had left a dirty spoon in the middle of our coffee table and I jokingly told A not to touch it to see how long it would take to be noticed. It stayed on the table for five days until I politely asked her to remove it.

3.  Body doubling? This happens consistently. Whenever she hears A or I getting up in the morning, she will get out of her room and use the bathroom for 15-40 minutes. Whenever she hears A return home from work (7-8pm most nights) she will jump up from whatever she's doing and immediately begin cooking or taking a shower, to the frustration of A because B takes very long (1 or 2 hours) doing either task and A wants to do both of those things as well when she gets home.

4. We don't talk, at all. No good morning, goodnights, how are you's. She seems to actively avoid talking to us and seems very skittish when we say a word towards her even from day one, even though I had tried to initiate a friendship and thought we had a good conversation when we first met. That first night we made plans to sit down and get to know each other that Sunday, but at the time we planned she left for work and came back at midnight.

I assumed she picked up a shift randomly, though she never clarified, and tried to initiate in friendly conversation again the next day or so, just asking about class schedules. She looked at me like a deer in headlights and awkwardly answered before she put in her headphones (If it sounds like something is missing I promise it's not that's literally all the context for that interaction LOL)

5. A and I have genuinely tried to communicate our expectations when it comes to apartment cleanliness. We have a Roommate Agreement that we all filled out and signed, and is now hanging on the fridge. A and I reviewed after she filled it out, and she put all the same notes we did. Like clean up after yourself, don't leave dishes out, don't share ingredients, do share appliances, etcetc. She's followed some things, but obviously anything about cleanliness was conveniently ignored.

And some rapid fire details because this is getting rambly: inviting over people without even a moments notice (men included), using blender and other loud appliances at 12-1am, using A and I's dishes and leaving them dirty, letting produce rot on the counter, leaving dirty underwear in the one shared bathroom

  
There is literally so much more I want to write about but that is the best summary because it's already getting longer than I wanted it to be. A and I have discussed these issues and tried to communicate over text because she refuses our attempts to have an in person discussion. She will either bare minimum fix what we ask about or ignore it entirely. I feel extremely rude but some of my frustrations have transferred into my texts because it's getting disgusting and I'm not her maid (though I still try to say please and thank you when I ask her to immediately do something; ex. getting her underwear out of the bathroom).

So the grinder has been performing poorly on my machine for a bit and stopped working altogether a couple weeks ago. I completely disassembled the grinder and replaced the primary gear inside which got everything functional again.

However now it has started taking a long time to grind and just stopped ejecting any ground coffee this morning. I considered that maybe the burrs were dull and needed replacing. I took this video of it grinding however, the coffee just won’t eject. Grind settings for this were 6 on the inner adjustment and 9 on the outside wheel adjustment.

I plan on taking it apart from the top just too clean it again but if anyone has anymore insight, I’d appreciate it!

After TB and I left the hotel, we dropped gear at camp and she layed down (not feeling well) so we shared a smoke and I was off to the Tims for WIFI. Met up with some of the homebums I've been chilling with, sat here almost all day, as long as you have a cup in front of you its free WIFI till abt 9.

Shared some laughs, cigs, and even a sneaky beer or two.

Met a guy while havin a smoke, saw my old boots tied to my bag and had to ask why, so I told him my story. ""Had em for years, not quite ready to dump em yet. They'll be gone before I head out tho"". Turns out he's a traveler too! Been rubbertramping out of the *most beat up* corrola ive ever seen. His set up was pretty sweet though all things considered.

I tried turning down his offer for a meal since I had the food cards, still untouched, but he insisted. ""Hey man, its free food, you can pay me back with company till I head out"" fuck, when you're right you're right. Chicken wrap and a table for two. We swap stories till closing, say our good byes, hes heading to Ontario that night, hopes to reach the AB/SK border before calling it a night. The weather should allow it.

Into the No Frills, hotdogs, bread, back to camp. TB is up, feeling a bit better, but not great. We kick on the burner (she works like a beaut) sticks in dogs, dogs over flame. Movie on, eat, cigs and finally sleep.

Woke up this morning *damn near sweating* our sleeping bags, despite being rated for only 2°C have been holding up amazing in these subzero temps.

She's really funny, pretty, intelligent, and seems like she's looking for something serious, as I am.

Anyway we had coffee for a first date, and dinner for a 2nd date. 

For a third date, I'm really tempted to take her to a gun range I have a membership at, then cook dinner at my place after and just watch tv or something. She's into guns,  as am I. 

My only concerns are

3rd date could be too soon to have someone over. But I mean she could always decline so not that big of a deal. 
     With this, I'm tempted to do a third date in the middle of this week in the hopes that she'd be comfortable enough that weekend to come over. However, I don't want to rush things. We've been going on a date a week so far, with minimal texting between.

Basically, I'd like to do the gun range/dinner at my place thing next weekend, but i don't want to blow those plans by pushing for it too soon, so I want to plan a date in the middle of the week, which has its own potential drawback of feeling rushed.

1i9xplg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1i9xplg/burnt_out_feels_like_im_single_parenting/,Burnt out feels like I’m single parenting,"Mom of 3 4 and under. A 4 year old 3 year old and 5 month old. I’m a SAHM and husband works. I do 95% of everything at home. Cleaning, cooking, every single night wake up with the baby, I homeschool my 4 year old. I try to make our snacks and food from scratch when I can. Mind you our house stays almost immaculate because I just can’t stand it dirty so I work really hard fighting to keep it clean. His uniform is almost always washed for him even though he leaves it on the floor and doesn’t even bother putting his clothes in the hamper. My husband will help but I don’t feel like he goes out of his way. For example he’ll help clean up after dinner but he’s always complaining about it or in a bad mood. He’ll fold laundry but not consistently. He does work really hard for our family and picks OT. He’s never said no to something we wanted but I just feel like a single parent most of the time. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells because of his piss poor attitude with me and the kids. He’s always aggravated always makes everyone feel like a burden. Our baby is an awful sleeper. I’m not exaggerating when I say he wakes up 7,8,9+ times a night and I take care of it every night. He hasn’t woken up with him since he was maybe 7 or 8 weeks old. Doesn’t wake up with him on weekends to let me sleep in in for another hour unless I wake him up and ask but who wants to have to ask their partner for support when the partner knows yours struggling. I haven’t had a decent nights sleep in 5 months. I don’t even have time to read a book or take a shower I feel so burnt out and I’ve expressed this and he seems to acknowledge it and then nothing changes. Today we tried to go out for a fun family outing and on the way back baby was screaming in the car seat. He said a smart comment so I said one back bc in the moment of 30 minutes of baby screaming in the car I just couldn’t hold my tongue back. So we get home he immediately goes to change into comfy clothes and goes poop. Meanwhile I have to pee, 3 year old needs to go potty, dog ate something he wasn’t supposed to while we’re gone, baby is upset and I’m trying to get the older 2 lunch. So he comes out 5 minutes later and tries to help get the kids lunch together. I asked him if he washed his hands because he’s bad about not doing it. He said no. I asked him to please wash them because he just touched the kids food. He threw the strawberries down on the counter, poured 10x the amount of soap he needed on his hands passive aggressively and half assed washed his hands. Then he slammed the cabinet shut and starts saying “if this is how you want to play okay!” I don’t even know what else he said I got so mad. Then he says he’s tired of my attitude. I genuinely had no attitude even though I was up literally all night with the baby. I thought we had a good morning minus the spattle in the car until that point. Yesterday, we had to take our car to get new brakes and it was a late appointment. So instead of me staying at the house with the kids I suggested we all go and walk to the restaurant next door while we wait. I had everything done so that when we got back the kids just needed to put their pajamas on and brush teeth. Coffee was set for the next day, dishwasher running, floors done, pajamas laid out. I figured out how to shower and put some makeup on because I wanted to actually look nice for once, had the kids dressed and ready to go when he walked in the door. I mean I did everything so it was seamless when we got home. So he comes home in a bad mood. He changes and I needed to put my shoes on and go pee. He comes back inside all possy because 3 year old wouldn’t let him put him
In car seat. So I grab my shoes and socks go out to the car barefoot, put his seat belt on and just put my shoes on in the car. Then I said something about it and he says “you knew all day we were doing this why didn’t you prepare”it just hurt my feelings so bad because I thought I had set it up so nice so we could enjoy the evening and not be stressed out when we got home. I don’t even know what to do anymore. He’s a good dad and husband but it’s like if he gets aggravated he can’t control his tongue whether it’s me or the kids. I try to do everything for everyone and I get no support. Both of his parents passed away and the only family I have is my mom but she lives and hour away, works full time and just isn’t very nurturing or helpful when it comes to the kids.

Still not my strong suit. I appreciate all the feedback last time and it helped me so much. Thanks for taking time out of your days to help. Hopefully I made it better not worse.

Dear \[Agent\],

I am seeking representation for my debut novel, THE SUNSETS WITH YOU, a contemporary romance complete at 86,000 words. It will appeal to readers who loved the Hollywood dynamic of When In Rome by Sarah Adams and lake town vibes of Meet Me At the Lake By Carley Fortune.

When it comes to taking risks, you’ll find Lena Oakley safely tucked away in her picturesque small town in Maine with her two best friends. Lena has spent years creating a perfect bubble free of tumultuous relationships, and anything anxiety inducing. But with a job she hates, no love life to speak of, and abandonment issues thanks to her mom, she is struggling to find her footing in adult life – unwilling to change a thing, until she finds a for sale sign at her beloved childhood lake house and an acceptance into NYU PR program. 

Lena is faced with staying in her familiar territory Greenwater where the coffee shop knows her order, friends are family, and where the sound of crashing waves is the background music. She has to decide if her status quo is actually fulfilling, simply familiar, or if leaving to chase her dreams of working behind the scenes on Broadway is worth the anxiety that comes with change. Sitting in a dark corner of her favorite bar, Lena catches her celebrity crush’s gaze. Stunned, she starts making a plan about how to approach him, until he abruptly walks out, rudely calling her out for staring.

Callum Hayes, is popping up everywhere, even at work-where she is now forced to work with him on his ad campaign. He turns his attention to her, apologizing for being brash. He slowly worms his way into her life, befriending her favorite people in town, and showering her in attention she's been craving–even if she’s not ready to admit it out loud. She is determined to keep him at arms length, fearful he’ll use her heart until he leaves like her mom did. After quitting her job on a whim and feeling reckless, she decides to say yes to a date with Callum. Cruising the lake, sharing their biggest fears, and him revealing his plans to stay in Maine making her feel a connection she’s never felt, making her question whether NYC is still a dream worth chasing.

Honestly, I get into waves of working out and then being lazy due to exhaustion, stress, distraction from too many random social events. But I've put on heaps of extra weight in the last 2 years which is becoming harder to shift.

At the moment, my routine is waking up, drinking water, having a pre-work out drink with caffeine and then using an exercise bike for 1hr where I ride 18-20ks on it with the tension control 3/4 of the way up.
I do this 6 days a week for the past 3 weeks in a good routine. Previously I'd ride a couple of times a week at most to be honest with you.

I'm in a calorie deficit of 1400
I record everything pretty strictly except for dinner, where I have downsized my portion, decreased the portion of things like rice or pasta, and added extra veggies (which I've always loved veg anyway)
I would still be hitting my deficit or going the tiniest bit over at most. 
If I'm working at night, I'll track all meals of the day and still be fine.

I've swapped out my daytime snacks for more fruit, veg, and a small handful of Brazil nuts.
Stopped having late night snacks.
Cut down on bread - maybe having one slice twice a week at most. And opt for wholemeal or multigrain versions where possible - if I'm eating bread it's with spinach, abo, tomato and an egg.
Cut out additional coffee because I feel too overloaded with fluids from the preworkout drink and all the water I've increased - I don't work a job where I can easily run to the bathroom 50 times a shift 🤣

I've almost stopped having snacks after dinner - if I'm having a movie night I will treat myself if my def allows but I've cut the portion down drastically.

But I've only lost 1kg in 3 weeks....
I did adjust my diet slightly before this so feel like I already lost an additional 1.5kg in that wave where people say you lose 'water weight'
But I'm feeling quite deflated with all this change and not seeing much change visually (I know it's only been 3 weeks)

The flat feelings are coming from previous experience where I feel like I've lost at least 0.5kg each week minimum. And I noticed the weight loss in my face first. 
I'm not noticing a change in my face this time around and because I've developed a double chin in the last year which is still here. It's throwing me off so bad. My BMI is like 26 and I wouldn't class myself as overweight, but visually being randomly bigger around my face is causing a lot of personal issues with my appearance that I can't shake.

I've always done a similar routine and after losing the weight I gained in the last 2 years I plan to stick to a reasonable routine to maintain my weight so that I don't stack it back on suddenly and to keep a healthier lifestyle because I do want to genuinely remain healthy as I age.
I guess in the past the difference would be that I ate boring bland salad every single day for lunch without any cheese or fats, no dressing etc. maybe that's why I dropped more weight and this time I'm trying to do it smarter and enjoy foods more?

I don't know. I'm rambling now.
Basically - am I missing any key steps? 
Am I overdoing it with the bike/should I be doing more there?
Any other details I should provide?

I know it's a slow progress to lose weight in a healthy way, I'm just struggling dramatically with my body image and want to live a healthier but sustainable life and not miss out on enjoying food with people 😭 ",3,1737839998.0,cycling,3,1.0,False

From this, we learned the theater was trying to get new programming going to draw more folks in. A friend and I pitched an idea, and we're hosting our first event on Wednesday at 9:15 PM. 

The series is called ""Film Flop Bingo"". Everyone will get their own bingo card to accompany the ""bad"" movie that we'll be playing. During the movie, you'll call out things that happen from your bingo card. E.g. ""bad camera work"". Our first movie is the Keanu Reeves classic, Johnny Mnemonic 

The first few players to get bingo will get prizes. The grand prize is $75 to [Oakland Guitars](https://www.oakland-guitars.com/) (the best guitar shop in the Bay!). We've also got a gift card to Snow White Coffee and the theater will be providing food/drink prizes. We're hoping to have a lively crowd, so come out and support the theater!

After what felt like hours of Tori Amos and Fiona Apple, Ben finally cracked, “The amount of female rage in this car is starting to scare me a bit, I feel like I’m at Lillith Fair right now.”

Allison crossed her arms and slouched in her seat. “Too young to get that reference.”

“Of course you are,” Ben said, relaxing for the first time in a while. He continued, “I’m sorry for calling you desperate. That was a dick move.”

Allison sat up and met his eyes, “No, I’m sorry. I’m obviously desperate. You don’t get in a car with a stranger and ask them to find your soulmate if you’re not desperate,” She paused, looking into her lap, “I guess I just didn’t like hearing it. So much for all my talk about honesty.”

Ben raised an eyebrow, smiling, “Oh you’re apologizing? That’s awesome. I was going to tell you the real story about my string as a way to make amends but it looks like we’re even now.”

Allison put her hand on Ben’s shoulder and squeezed, “I take my apology back! I was justified in everything I’ve ever said and done. You were terrible, a total monster. You owe me that story, Ben!”

Ben laughed, “Fine. But don’t expect much. The reason I was so obsessed with making money off my gift? It wasn’t greed—it was desperation. I wanted to follow my own string. After helping other people find their soulmates, I realized just how expensive it could be. Flights, hotels... it added up fast. So I saved every penny I could. Even then, I couldn’t say no to clients.”

“Such a softie,” Allison said, with a smile.

Ben glanced at Allison before turning his eyes back to the road, not sure if he’s ever been referred to as a “softie” in his life, 

“Anyway, when I was 21, I finally had enough. I tracked my string all the way to this little coffee shop in Malmö. The moment I saw her, I didn’t even need to see the strings connect. She was the most beautiful woman I’d ever seen.”

Allison leaned in, her breath catching. “What happened?”

“She was sitting with this guy—like, a better-looking Skarsgård brother—and a baby,” Ben said, his voice clipped. His knuckles tightened on the wheel. “Broke my heart.”

“It could have been his sister!,” Allison pleaded, “Don’t all Swedes look alike anyway?”

“Please, I’m not an idiot. It wasn’t like I saw her and then ran out of the coffee shop back to New York. The man she was with got up to use the restroom, I followed him in there, asked if he was with his wife, he said yeah, and THEN I ran back to New York.” Ben tried to make it sound funny but he could hear the misery in his voice. 

“So you really cut off your string?”, Allison asked quietly.

“Yeah, at the airport. Didn’t want to be tempted to go back. Didn’t want to keep looking at it. Moving on.”

The car was silent for a second until Allison said, “So what if it wasn’t your string but a client’s? Would you have, like, made them turn around and cut their’s off?”

Ben gave her a strange look, “No, of course not. Enforcing my principles on clients is terrible for business. No one wants a judgy matchmaker.”

Allison raised an eyebrow, her voice incredulous. “Right. Except for me, apparently. You wouldn’t take me on until I broke up with Jason—why was that any different?”

Ben flushed, “That was completely different! You wanted me to do it for free, I had to make sure you were serious.”

Allison leaned forward, her voice sharper. “So you have a moral code until someone gives you enough money? I don’t buy it.”

Ben slightly raised his voice, “What do you mean: you don’t buy it? Money erodes principles- more news at eleven!”

Allison shook her head, “That’s not what I meant. What I meant was that you didn’t turn around from that coffee shop in Sweden because of some stupid moral code, you did it because you were a coward.”

Ben laughed bitterly, “Wow, you pull all this shit about wanting to hear the story and then when i finally tell you, you call me a coward.”

He glanced over at her, hoping to catch a flicker of shame, but there was nothing. Instead, she met his eyes, unflinching.

“Wasn’t much of a story, Ben,” she said evenly. “You went all the way there to find your soulmate and did nothing about it. And now you frame it like it was some noble, selfless act, but the truth? You were scared.”

Ben thought about all the comebacks he could say. That she didn’t know him at all. That he wasn’t going to take this kind of shit from a broke receptionist who was in such an unhappy relationship, that she dumped him at the word of a total stranger. 

Instead he said, careful to keep his tone light, “Okay, Freud, thanks a lot for the psychoanalysis. Cool party trick. But I think it’s my turn to put on some music.”

“Fine,” Allison stated flatly.

I noticed there were some broken leaves, almost dust, so I’m trying shorter steeps. The 3rd steep was bitter at 15 seconds, so I did the next one for 10 seconds but it’s still quite bitter and dry. On the 5th steep now and the dry/bitter thing is fading, and the toasty rice flavor is prominent. 

Not a huge fan of this one, maybe next time I’ll try different brewing parameters to keep the bitterness down. The toasty flavor was nice though.

Then there's the fat guy who finds out he has kids and mr milkshake knows about but won't tell him and still, fat guy does nothing. Also, mark realizes grey haired psycho knows something about his dead wife that hes heartbroken over..... Does absolutely nothing when she leaves and tries to run him over.. Man what the fuck... Jump in the car and run her over until she talks!!!

Come on ffs, show some backbone and stand up for yourself! Dont do your job if you want to get out? Go around break shit until they make you leave for good. Start beating people or kill your boss if you want revenge or to get out. Show some balls and go mental like you should the second you get put in a place like that and dont get to leave. Instead you have these cowards doing fuckall  
  
I get that you cease to exist when you get out. I also get that some of the characters need to stay to earn a living since they can't get any other jobs. My point is that they should show some resistance for being put I a place like that and being treated the way they are. So far there hasn't been any real repercussions and those they got, (reading from a screen) doesn't seem that bad? And why read at all in the first place? Why follow them into that room at all?

1i9wksk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1i9wksk/i_accidentally_got_petty_revenge_on_my_manager/,I accidentally got petty revenge on my manager,"First of all hi charlotte, I love your videos. You make a bad day a good day. 

So I live in Canada, Alberta specifically. I worked at Tim hortons in my early 20’s (shocker I know how Canadian of me) anyways I came into work one day and we had the main manager and the owner in that day. (I’ve changed all their names) The main manager worked at a few locations we’ll call him Tom. Tom was the one who hired me and I seemed to get along with him fairly well. I had worked at a few of the locations owned by (we’ll call her Rachel) and her husband (we’ll call him Adam) this specific location however was mainly ran and operated by Rachel. When Rachel would come in everyone would be tense and whispering when she’d come in. She would blame us for all kinds of things but she always took money out of the register. Well this specific day, Tom and Rachel were both in. It was probably close to the morning rush or just before lunch as it’s been a few years since this story happened. Tom told me to work the cash register and I’d typically have a runner (the person who makes and serves the coffee and such). Part of your job as a cashier is to grab the donuts and muffins and make the coffees if your runner leaves for whatever reason. My runner on that day had wandered off so I thought I’d make the coffees and grab the donuts myself (as I should be allowed because I’m trained for all) however Tom came over and abruptly told me I should stay put and not make the coffees. I said my runner is gone so they needed to find that person so I didn’t have to be all over the place. Fast forward not even 20 minutes later I’m at the register and my runner disappears again so I make the coffees and serve them. Tom abruptly (again) tells me not to move. So here’s where my accidental petty revenge came in. The next customer came up to the till and ordered a medium coffee. He happened to be the last person in the line. So what did I do? I didn’t move from the cash register, like I had been previously told numerous times. And where was my runner ? Nowhere in sight. We had probably four people waiting on foods and drinks. Anyways. The guy comes up to the till (whose order I just took) and says “well are you going to make my coffee) to which I reply “no my manager told me I’m not allowed to move). Probably two minutes later the manager comes over and gets mad at me that the coffees aren’t being made so I look at him and say, well I was doing them previously, but you told me to stop moving so I stayed at the register like you asked me too. It gave me so much joy to see the look on his face when he realized his comments had backfired and angered the customers. And although I got blamed for it, it’s still one of my favorite stories to this day. I also never saw that customer come in ever again after that. And that location actually ended up losing a lot of customers due to the owner, because she was rude and harsh to her staff and would cut people with no notice or any contact at all. She ended up on the news actually for writing a children’s book. Can’t remember what it’s about, but we all know how stubborn she really is. Anyways. I hope you enjoyed my accidental petty revenge as much as I did and still do. ",1,1737837942.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,5,1.0,False

1i9we0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1i9we0j/introverts_and_anxiety_practical_strategies_for/,Introverts and Anxiety: Practical Strategies for Sustainable Wellbeing,"Introverts. Those of us who prefer calm situations and environments. We may enjoy socialising but we recharge by spending time on our own, we often enjoying getting lost in our own thoughts – just enjoying being inside our own heads for a while. We tend to lean toward smaller, close-knit social lives. But let’s clear up a misconception: introversion doesn’t mean we’re anti-social. It just means we are at our best in situations that aren’t overwhelming.


Anxiety. The emotion that warns us when something threatening seems to be just around the corner. In moments of true danger, it can be life-saving: the foresight that there is trouble ahead, and those vital few seconds to get ready for it saved many of our ancient ancestors (while their peers perished – unable to pass on their genes.) That’s one of the factors why we’re here today. But, when anxiety lingers beyond its intended purpose, it becomes not just tiring—it’s exhausting. If this sounds familiar, you’re definitely not alone.

Not all introverts experience anxiety, and you don’t have to be an introvert to struggle with it. But many introverts do. It’s a common combination, and knowing how to navigate it can make all the difference.


Signs You’re an Introvert with Anxiety—which ones do you relate to the most?
1. You Typically Overprepare
You think through worst-case scenarios in detail. It makes you feel more in control—but it can also be draining.
Tip: When you find yourself imagining worst-case outcomes, think about a balanced ""most likely scenario"" scenario too. Give yourself permission to think about the ‘’best case scenario’’ – luck isn’t a good strategy, but take it when you get it! Thinking through these scenarios helps to bring your anxious thoughts back to a more realistic middle ground. This practice doesn’t stop your mind from thinking about risks but it does help add perspective.


2. You Tend to Overthink and Listen to Your Inner Critic
Introverts often have rich inner lives, which can mean their internal dialogue is active—sometimes too active. Anxiety amplifies this, often turning up the volume on self-critical thoughts.
Tip: Develop a ritual for challenging anxious thoughts. When a negative thought comes up, ask yourself: ""Is this thought 100% true?"" Most often, it won’t be. Questioning and even writing down these thoughts can give you some distance from them, reducing their power. If this is an issue for, look up my article ‘From Limitations to Liberation’ – it takes a dive in to tackling limiting beliefs. 


3. You Always Feel the Need to Be Busy
Anxiety often compels you to keep moving (it’s a high energy ‘state’ – one of the reasons it can be so tiring)—constantly doing something. But staying busy can sometimes just mean staying distracted, without actually being effective.
Tip: Replace ""busy"" with ""purposeful."" Each day, set just one or two specific goals that really matter to you. A small amount of focused effort is often more satisfying (and less stressful) than a day spent rushing from one task to the next with no real direction. Ask yourself at least five times a day: ‘what is the most value adding thing (in the context of what your life is about) I could be doing right now?’


4. You Prefer Routines and Struggle When Things Go Off-Plan
Routines give a sense of control, but sometimes they turn into rigid safety nets – sometimes beyond them being value adding. When something unexpected happens, it can trigger deep unease.
Tip: Practice gentle flexibility. Start small: maybe change the route you walk or try a new café. These small ""novelty exercises"" help build resilience for when larger, unexpected changes occur. The key is to show yourself that change, is often manageable. Remember that change is neither good or bad (change can also be for the better). Remember also that we have been ‘programmed’ by our evolution to perceive change as bad: once we transcend that ‘programming’ new avenues of opportunity open up for us.  


5. You Hide Nervousness Behind a Mask
You’ve learned to mask nervousness well, but that doesn’t mean it’s not taking a toll internally.
Tip: Identify trusted people who you can be honest with. Even if it’s just one close friend or a journal entry, letting out what you're feeling helps you process the anxiety instead of holding it all in. Vulnerability is powerful; it connects you to others and often takes the edge off anxiety.


6. You See More Danger Than Others in Everyday Situations
Anxiety primes your mind to be vigilant (and reduces your options – see my article ‘Live the life you choose – expand your Thought-Action Repertoire’), sometimes turning neutral situations into seemingly threatening ones.
Tip: Try reframing the ""threat."" If you’re anxious before a social event, instead of focusing on what could go wrong, set a small, achievable goal for the event—like having a meaningful conversation with one person. Reframing your focus can help your mind move away from perceived threats and toward positive intentions.


7. Perfectionism and People-Pleasing
Perfectionism often stems from a need to feel worthy. Beliefs like “I need everyone to like me to be valuable” create intense anxiety around how you’re perceived.
Tip: Shift from a focus on being liked to being authentic (are you living your life for you or for ‘them’?) Practice saying ""no"" in low-stakes situations. Remember, you’re not responsible for everyone else’s happiness: you are responsible for your well-being (not theirs!) The right people will appreciate your true self more than a perfected (according to who?) version of you.


8. Nerves Sometimes Turn You In to an Over-Talker
Normally, you speak only when you feel confident, but anxiety can shift you into overdrive, where you say too much to fill the silence.
Tip: If you catch yourself over-talking, pause and take a deep breath. Silence can feel awkward, but it’s not a problem. Giving yourself permission to pause helps reduce the pressure to fill every moment with words.


9. Trouble Sleeping
Anxiety makes it hard for your mind to shut off at night, leading to trouble falling asleep, frequent waking, or early rising.
Tip: Create a ""wind-down"" routine. Dedicate the last 30-60 minutes before bed to relaxing, tech-free activities. Reading something light, or writing down your thoughts can help signal your brain that it’s time to rest. Top tips (1) get as cold as you can (reductions in our core body temperatures are a cue to go to sleep) (2) forget the clock telling you it is ‘lights out’ time – read until your eyes close and your head nods.


Moving From Awareness to Action
Being an introvert with anxiety can feel overwhelming at times, but it’s also something you can learn to manage with care and practice. Anxiety may not disappear overnight, but you can make shifts that help it lose its hold on your everyday life. You’re not alone. Many of us walk this path, learning how to balance the gifts and challenges of introversion and anxiety. Keep being gentle with yourself—there’s strength in softness.


Practical Strategies for Thriving as an Introvert

1.	Create and Protect Your Recharge Time
For us introverts, alone time is essential for recharging. Make it non-negotiable. Whether it’s 30 minutes in the morning or a quiet evening ritual, schedule time just for yourself. Communicate this need with those around you—it’s a matter of maintaining your well-being, not just a preference.


2.	Leverage Your Strengths in One-on-One or Small Group Interactions
We tend to excel in deeper, more intimate conversations. Rather than pushing yourself to thrive in large social gatherings, seek out or create opportunities for one-on-one or small group interactions. You could host a dinner with close friends, or meet up individually for coffee. Cultivate the type of social life that aligns with your strengths.


3.	Prepare and Plan for Social Situations
One of the best tools for introverts is preparation. If you have a social event or a work meeting coming up, prepare conversation topics, questions, or think about what you hope to get from the interaction. This doesn’t mean scripting everything, but it does mean having some mental prompts to feel more comfortable and confident. You don’t even have to say much: a few thoughtful questions can go a long way.


4.	Create a Space at Home that Grounds You
Set up a specific space in your home where you feel completely relaxed—this could be a reading nook, a meditation corner, or even just a comfy chair by a window. Use this space to do whatever helps you feel grounded, such as journaling, reading, or simply sitting in silence. Having a dedicated spot to return to helps to re-centre yourself, especially after having been with people.


5.	Harness Your Listening Superpower
Introverts are often strong listeners, and this can be a powerful skill in both social and work settings. Make it a habit to ask thoughtful questions and really listen—this not only helps you navigate social settings more comfortably, but also makes people value your presence. Remember, quality over quantity is where you shine.


So, ask yourself: What is one thing from this article that resonates most with you? What small action can you take today to start navigating your life in a healthier way?
And what are your own go to strategies?",1,1737837438.0,selfhelp,0,1.0,False

Their statement

 
Shawlands Newest Brunch Spot Opens Today!!! 

Murray Firth opened today at 9am! 

Don’t miss a statement from the old Brooklyn Cafe team, it’s below if you want to know more! (It’s long, they are a passionate bunch that are going through a tough time so swerve it if you are in a rush) 

Murray Firth plan to open 9am 4pm seven days a week selling banging fry ups, fully loaded tater tots and grilled cheese (with a cheese pull to die for) amongst many other epic brunch dishes. 

Opening in the old Brooklyn cafe, here is what made them give the business back to Murray Firth who departed the unit nearly 100 years ago. 👇 

Brooklyn cafe statement; 
Yesterday storm Eowyn brought another considerable weather event to Glasgow. Being open for 94 years the cafe has seen many weather events. All of which come with bad conditions and many of which cause local damage. 
Every time this happens we assess the events and plan ahead, Storm Eowyn was no different. During an event like this we are very self aware, inside a tenement building likely built in the 1880’s and turned from Murray Firth fish mongers to a cafe in 1930 and into Brooklyn Cafe in 1931. This building needs upkeep constantly, it simply can’t take on storms like this without support. 

So who will support it, we are a family run business that is on the fourth generation since it became The Brooklyn Cafe, staying in the family since. Add up the years of service from our five longest serving workers and they have 111 years of Brooklyn between them, that’s who will look after it. Those who understand, that to us Brooklyn cafe is not a job, it’s a way of life, those will be the ones who want to step up, and that will start with me. I won’t let that cafe face a storm without my support. 

I asked the management team what they thought, and we agreed all three of us would go in before the red warning and man the building until after it was lifted. As I said the building needs work. We had a list of tasks to take care of inside the cafe if the day passed uneventfully. This plan would have meant it was almost like a typical shift for us, so no hassle maybe just some paint on our hands at the end. From there we decide if we should open or not, and we have been here before and when we open on days like this we lose money. Running the equipment and heating the cafe will cost more than we take when people are advised to stay home. But not everyone has that luxury. Not everyone can stay home and those who can’t stay home might need somewhere warm to stop by or somewhere to refuel between call outs. So as we have done many times we took the hit, we opened when it would have been easier and cheaper for us to closed. 

The next thing we done, was tell our staff they didn’t need to come in. Some of our staff wanted to come along as well, they offered to help with some DIY and look after any customers we did get. Travel to and from the cafe for them would also have been outside the red weather warning, but we told them just to take the time off as this felt like the safest way to go. 

We had a variety of customers in, most of which had no option yesterday. We had safety teams who were trying to maintain roads, tradesmen who were on constant emergency calls, guys cutting trees that had fallen and hospital workers amongst others. There were some customers who maybe didn’t have to be out, but we don’t know there situations so we don’t question them, that’s not our place. 

Did the day go to plan yesterday? Yes 100%, we served those who needed us, even selling things we don’t normally sell to people were caught short and needed things we had in, so we got it for them. 
But the most important thing was being there for the building when it needed us, and it needed us more than ever. The storm was clearly bashing the area hard, and we knew anything could happen at any time. We had tools ready for most eventualities, and plans for power cuts to eat all the icecream before it melts. When the sign came down we were on it instantly, we watched it come down in three huge parts with a ~50kg chunk of signage caught and swinging in the lighting cables four feet off the ground. We were quickly able to isolate the power and cut down the signage to stop the dangerous swinging chunk of shop front and live wires, next up we had three large ~50kg chunks of shop on the ground with a littering of smaller bits all laden with nails and sharp splinters, just about to take off. We set about getting this into a safe place instantly, helped by people who had seen it from their window and stepped in to help. Within minutes of the storm ripping our signage off the danger to the surrounding area was fully taken care of. We went back inside and started making the building safe. Had we not been there to look after our cafe the damage to the cafe would have been significantly worse and no doubt the debris would have caused more widespread damage and would have absolutely needed an emergency team to attend the debris. We hope those who didn’t have to attend the danger posed by our debris made a difference somewhere else. As we were all in this together at the end of the day. 

So, if you are still reading this here is the bit you’re probably here to read. We asked on socials for anyone who could maybe help board up the cafe to save us having to pull straws for who stays all night to watch over the gaping holes in the building. And that’s when we got so quickly reminded that the community we work with and love so dearly harbour the most horrible individuals who seem to think for some reason that a business is some sort of faceless front. 

We have been battered constantly online for forcing our staff to come to work during the weather warning, when none of our staff outside the management were even there. The managers who did come in also done so totally voluntarily. We done it to look after our cafe and because we are a close knit team. We were there in the end for fourteen hours each today to make sure our staff had a job to come back to today and our customers could in for some epic scran and dubious chat. We never forced anyone to travel to work. And those who think we did couldn’t even muster the decency to ask us if this was the case, or do something about it.

We are catering workers as well, three of those five longest serving workers mentioned above aren’t family and have left the cafe before and come back because nowhere else is like it. We have the same morals as a lot of these people who are hurling abuse at us, but it’s fine to abuse us? It’s fine to say “get it up you” to us, or to tell us that it’s karma and we deserved it, or this mornings comment that we should hang our head in shame. Well we don’t agree, we done what we thought was best for the cafe, and best for the community yesterday and we stand by that wholeheartedly. 

We may have got it wrong, or you may disagree, but disagreeing or feeling we done wrong should result in adult discussion. Comments on social media trying to drum up hatred for a family run business is not how to go about it. 

Unite Hospitality commented on our instagram post asking why on earth did we open meaning that workers has to come in to serve food/drinks during a threat to life warning. 

Unite, we respect you. You stand up for people like us when we get a hard time. The vast majority of catering managers and a lot of owners stated at the bottom and we need organisations like you to help as it’s a horrible place at times. But surely you can do better than going for likes in the comments  section by throwing mud? Contact us directly, contact our staff, do something about it. None of our staff were asked to work and all those who were in the cafe travelled outside the danger to life hours. But well done, your comment is the most liked comment of our post so I guess that’s you really standing up those who need you? What would you have actually done if we had forced staff to come in and take undue risk? Those in our sector out there who were made to work today deserve better from you. (*Additionally after originally writing this you have called my fourteen year old daughter “really quite sad” for defending the business, the business I have worked at since a decade before she was even born. You have substantiated your “facts” by stating that “members told us”. I don’t know who you think you are better than but I can tell you right now that you are not better than Olivia,  and will not be speaking to her like that again. We have been stressed and tired trying to do the best in adverse situations but now you have made us angry, this business is a family and someone like you talking to one of our children like that has enraged the whole team. You clearly don’t support catering staff you abuse them. Very, very disappointed! You can remove the respect we had for you, for now. Please do better.)

Attacking small business in the community is just like attacking your peers walking down the street, we all work, live and socialise in Shawlands. But for some reason we become cannon fodder for not dealing with a situation exactly as you would have liked. We are happy to stand up and take responsibly for our actions, we won’t hide behind an anonymous post on a community page, or create fake accounts to put down others without having to face backlash. We do what we think is right, we accept when things don’t go to plan or we make a mistake and we learn from it. We don’t ask for anything in return, we get what we deserve from our loyal customer base who love us for who we are as individuals, as a team and as an independent business. 

If you are reading this, and you are one of the ones that put us down yesterday then know that your comment was the very one that broke the camels back. That’s why we have chucked it. 

Say hello to Murray Firth, maybe they can do a better job? 

Those who have stated they will never return due to the Brooklyn opening yesterday have exactly what they wished for. Twenty six, yes twenty six locally sourced, free range, cruelty free, non GMO staff out of a job. 
When you attack a small business you can do a lot of damage, and if you do enough damage you will put all their staff out of a job. So when you think a business is mistreating staff think about what your end game is. If you want the business’s to make better choices going forward reach out and discuss or put your views across in a constructive manner,  like an adult. If you feel those staff would be better off without a job than keep up the good work. 

The Brooklyn cafe wasn’t just a cafe, it was a way life. 

Good luck to the team at Murray Firth, we hear they have a rather flamboyant host who can entertain children and dogs like no other mortal. They have already stolen our caramel shortcake recipe so that’s clearly going to be a highlight and supposedly the coffee beans they use can cure even the worst of hangovers when it’s coupled with their epic fry ups that are sourced from four different local butchers to ensure the best quality in every bite. 

So long Shawlands

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity. While we're on the topic, since it fits better here than in most spots, I don't do the politics thing. If it's a requirement of yours that someone shares your exact political, cultural, or personal values, we should discuss it bluntly and quickly to see if something is possible between us. No 'side' or 'sphere' is one I relate all that much to and I have contentions with all of them.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1737837259.0,MeetPeople,0,1.0,False

1i9wap7,https://www.reddit.com/r/doctorsUK/comments/1i9wap7/should_i_leave/,Should I leave?,"I’ve been seriously considering leaving medicine. I’ve worked so hard to get where I am today, sacrificing my social life and missing important events throughout university. Right now, I have a good job as an IMT in London, but I’m really having doubts about it.
It feels like being a doctor isn’t as respected as it used to be. I get to the ward, and before I can even take my coat off, I’m bombarded with silly requests from nurses. There’s not even anywhere I can leave my coat, we don’t have lockers (whereas other healthcare professionals always seem to!)

I also feel like I’m really struggling with compassion fatigue. The emotional weight of this job is taking a toll on me. By the time I get home, I’m so drained I can barely take care of myself or even hold a conversation. On my days off, all I want to do is sleep and be alone. I was diagnosed with depression years ago, and just a few months ago, I ended up in the hospital after taking an overdose (the first time that’s happened).
Work has been supportive, but I just can’t shake the feeling that things won’t get better. I’ve failed MRCP Part 1 three times now, and I had to withdraw from the January exam because of my mental health. Studying while working is hard enough, but adding in any semblance of a social life feels impossible. All I want to do is sleep.
I’m seriously thinking about leaving medicine for consultancy. I know people say the grass isn’t always greener, and that consultancy might not offer much job satisfaction, but I honestly don’t feel fulfilled as a doctor anymore. It feels like I’m fighting a losing battle, and the toll it’s taking on my mental health just doesn’t seem worth it. Most days feel worse than the good ones, and I’m struggling to support my friends and family because I don’t have the energy for myself. At least with consultancy, I’d be able to work from home, have a decent coffee machine, and not worry about expensive exams. From what I’ve heard, people are generally valued more there too.
Sorry for venting, but right now, I’m just feeling like staying in medicine isn’t going to get any better and I can’t really see any other way out",37,1737837192.0,doctorsUK,13,0.88,False

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity. While we're on the topic, since it fits better here than in most spots, I don't do the politics thing. If it's a requirement of yours that someone shares your exact political, cultural, or personal values, we should discuss it bluntly and quickly to see if something is possible between us. No 'side' or 'sphere' is one I relate all that much to and I have contentions with all of them.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.

Left my career in the healthcare field to pursue entrepreneurship, and ever since I made the decision it feels like a weight has been lifted. For anyone who’s been waiting to pull the trigger, please make sure you have a financial plan in place first. This is not something I jumped into with no money down, and I’m also going in with the mentality that I may fail, but that’s worth the risk to me. 

I am fortunate enough to have a bit of crypto (not much, but enough) as well as some savings that I was able to save over the last few years. I financed the used trailer for 20k w/ 10% down plus some fees. I had to purchase a truck to tow which I financed at 11k w/ 20% down plus fees. Be smarter than me when you set up your LLC. My business banker told me after the fact that there were far cheaper, and even free ways to do it. My local wholesale partner is going to provide me new equipment at the wholesale cost and install as well as maintain the equipment year round for no additional costs. 

I’ve still got many things left to do but this was no doubt one of the best decisions I ever made. I’m 30 w/ a wife and kid on the way, and knew it was now or never because it’s hard to give up that steady paycheck when you have multiple mouths to feed.

1i9w7u6,https://www.reddit.com/r/digital_marketing/comments/1i9w7u6/ad_copy_that_converts_three_lessons_from_spending/,Ad Copy That Converts: Three Lessons From Spending Six Figures Of My Own Money On Google Ads,"**Lesson 1: Emotion + Facts: The Winning Combo**

* To create ad copy that truly converts, you need to speak to both the heart and the mind. All decisions, whether we like it or not, are largely emotional, with logic serving as post-action justification. The best-performing ads tap into this, combining emotional appeal with factual proof to compel action - emotions drive clicks and facts build trust (and in turn conversions). Great ad copy blends both of them together seamlessly.
* **Example:**
   * Emotional Hook: *“Tired Of Feeling Stuck In Your Career?”*
   * Factual Proof: *“95% Of Our 20,000 Graduates Landed A High-Paying Job In Tech Within 6 Months.”*
* **Pro Tip:**
   * Adjust the emotional & factual balance by your product / service niche and audience type. Low cost commodity physical products will require different language & tonality to say an enterprise software company for example. Find the emotional and factual balance that converts best for your audience, and scale those campaigns accordingly.

**Lesson 2: Specificity Will Always Beat Generalization**

* Now that we’ve covered the importance of emotion and facts, let’s talk about another crucial element - specificity. Generic half-hearted ad copy doesn’t just not stand out, it actively reduces trust. People respond to offers that make them feel heard. Being specific helps your ad answer the user’s subconscious question: *“Why does this ad deserve a click?”.* After all, you're also competing against a sea of often higher ranked organic results.
* **Example**
   * Generic: *“Reduce Joint Pain Using Our Proprietary Formula”*
   * Specific: *“Relieve Joint Pain By More Than 50% In Just 14 days - Clinically Proven And Trusted By 25,000+ Arthritis Sufferers Worldwide.""*
* **Pro Tip:**
   * Always include numbers to describe time saved, results achieved, or improvements made. Use data from real customer results and case studies to provide this type of specificity. Test out anchoring your offer to industry comparisons. By positioning your product against competitors you addresses the user’s implicit question: *“Why should I choose you over others?”*

**Lesson 3: The Importance of Contextual Relevance**

* Great ad copy isn’t just about what you say, it’s about saying it at the right place & time. Contextual relevance ensures your message resonates with the user’s immediate situation, such as their location, device or even time of day. When ads feel personalized to the moment, they drive higher engagement and conversions.
* **Example**
   * Not Contextually Relevant: *“Fast Online Coffee Order”*
   * Contextually Relevant: *“Hot Coffee Delivered To Your Office In Under 20 Minutes - Perfect For Your Afternoon Break.”*
* **Pro Tip:**
   * This is quite offer dependant but using geo-targeting and separating out your campaigns to make your ad feel local will always provide better results than not doing so. Tailor your messaging to align with user behaviour throughout the day and thoughtfully account for how mobile users interact with your ads differently than desktop users.

Now, all of this is well and good but it can only take you so far without a proper landing page that knows how to convert users. But I'll leave out that rabbit hole for another time... As always, if you have a question that you don't want to share publicly, DM's are open.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity. While we're on the topic, since it fits better here than in most spots, I don't do the politics thing. If it's a requirement of yours that someone shares your exact political, cultural, or personal values, we should discuss it bluntly and quickly to see if something is possible between us. No 'side' or 'sphere' is one I relate all that much to and I have contentions with all of them.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way.

I've been interested in penpalling ever since I was a kid - back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from half way across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. I've been fortunate enough to have had a few before, mostly focusing on item exchanges, letters, and postcards, and would like to see if I can find that again, being able to live those experiences and to give that to someone else as well.

Ideally, I'd like to have a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items. Due to the private nature of penpaling, however, I'd like us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let's become familiar with each other to make sure we're a good fit. All that being said, I'm also interested in having e-mail penpals, which I'd be open to in the immediate now. It's more than possible for one form to transition into the other or for us to have multiple forms of penpalling going on at the same time.

My ideal communication method with someone is in the form of lengthy, detailed, intricate paragraphs and pages that delve into a variety of topics and themes. Even when meeting people in less defined ways we sometimes end up becoming de facto penpals due to how long it takes to properly respond to each other. So, if digital exchange is what you're after, this is the style it should take. I'm less particular when it comes to the physical. I've done pages upon pages in the form of letters and postcards in what looked like 8 point font, as well as exchanges that included almost no words at all or even focused exclusively on items. The form of our penpalling doesn't matter as much as what works for us. Above all, I'm here to meet a person that I want to engage in penpalling with and not someone to fulfill a word count and dollar amount. What I'm after is connection and intrigue and not an extra piece of mail every few weeks.

On that note, who, exactly, may you be connecting with?

I'm 34, male, and from the Eastern US. I'm looking for someone that I first and foremost relate to on a personal and deeper level. My ideal is to actually get to know my penpal - cold exchanges are less interesting to me, but aren't completely rejected. Location doesn't matter as much, as who the person is defines whether I'd like to connect with them or not. That being said, I do have a preference for cultural exchange and differences, so I'm more open to people from parts of the world more distinct from my own. Part of why I like penpaling is to be exposed to things I otherwise wouldn't be and to allow that for someone else as well. But, whether you're in my state or half the world away, it's you, the person, I want to exchange with.

* I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion. I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.

1i9w38v,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i9w38v/my_wifes_cold_was_something_much_worse/,My wife's cold was something much worse,"For twenty-five years, I was in a rigid routine. I’d work in the mornings, come home to my wife later in the afternoons, and we’d spend our evenings together eating her home cooked meals and watching TV until night came and we would go to bed. Then we would do it all over again. Sometimes I would doubt our life together. A nagging voice in the back of my head told me I didn’t do enough for her. That we should want for more. But then I’d wake up, and hear her singing softly as she cooked our breakfast, and any doubts I had would fade away. We could have kept going like that forever, but we never got the chance.

I’m sat here alone now in our bedroom, huddled up in a blanket, typing on my laptop, and eating some awful fast food. I can’t bear to leave this room. I know that if I open that door and walk down that hall, I’ll pass what used to be our kitchen. What remains is just an open, lifeless room. The cabinets had to be torn out and the floor ripped up from the damage. I arranged for some good men from the church to take the stove one day. I couldn’t bear to be there when they took it. I left the front door unlocked and hid like a coward, until I heard them leave.

I already burned through my bereavement leave, but I haven’t gone back to work. I just sit in our room and listen. I keep hoping to hear her voice again. Instead, all I hear is silence. The house is so quiet. So still. And in those endless spans of silence my mind fills in the void with harsh memories. The thoughts eat away at me like acid. Sometimes its questions, about what I could have done differently. Other times its like a film on repeat, the scenes playing out relentlessly. On the worst days, in the cold silence, the thing that consumes my mind are those final moments I had with her.

A week before it happened, she told me what was wrong. It was a warm Monday afternoon and I had just gotten home from work. She was in her usual place, cooking over the stove. The sound of sizzling pan-seared steak filled my ears. The room was slightly smoky and it smelt heavenly throughout the house. I could feel the heat as I walked into the kitchen to greet her.

She was wearing some jeans and that tan cardigan she liked over her blouse. I hugged her, head over her shoulder, and asked how she was doing today, like I did every day. I expected her to say something sweet in her usual way. Instead, she surprised me when she said,

“I’m cold”.

I laughed at her. I thought it was a joke. I mean, it was a nice 84 degrees outside, and it was noticeably hotter in the kitchen. I genuinely thought she was just pulling my leg but no. She didn’t laugh back. Didn’t even smile. She rolled up her sleeve and showed me her goosebumps with a look of tentative concern.

We figured she had a weird fever. She didn’t feel particularly warm, but we decided to treat it like a fever anyways and I put her to bed after dinner, skipping our TV shows that night. She got under the covers, despite me telling her not to, but I let it slide. As I was leaving the room to let her rest, I remember how she grabbed my hand and she asked me if I would stay for a prayer. Church had always been more of her thing than mine, but I didn’t mind. I thought she might feel better if she did, so I closed my eyes and let her pray:

“Dear Heavenly Father, Hallowed be thy name. You are the Father of health and wellness and Satan is the father of sickness and suffering. I pray that this sickness will leave my body and I will feel your warmth once again. In your name I pray, amen.”

She seemed satisfied and I wanted to give her space so I left and tended to the house. I washed the dishes, cleaned up the kitchen, and watched some of our shows without her. I remember feeling lonely that night. Her absence felt like a tear in a winter coat. When I came to bed, I was relieved to have her by my side again. I was sure that in a day or two this fever would pass and she’d be right by my side again. But this wasn’t a fever.

Our routine was disrupted into something new. Something worse. Now, I’d come home, and go straight to our bedroom to see her. She insisted on turning off the fans and keeping the door shut. When I opened the door, my glasses fogged. I’d find her, kept under more blankets than I remembered giving her, usually sleeping. I’d sit by her, and ask her how she was feeling. Each day she gave the same one-word answer, each more disheartened than the last.  

“Cold.”

The task of cooking fell on me, and I thought I couldn’t go wrong with some chicken noodle soup. It was supposed to help, but I’m no cook. There was always missing something. Something I couldn’t give it. But we ate it all the same. I learned I had to let it cool before I gave it to her, otherwise she’d scald her mouth, not that she seemed to mind.

After dinner, I would clean up, watch some shows alone while she went back to sleep, then I’d join her in bed. I’d try to snuggle up to her. To give her some of my body heat. I tried to take the cold from her. But after a time, I gave up. She was too cold to hold on to for any long period of time. I wish I held her anyways.

Sometimes, I would press my hand against her cheek. Then her forehead. Sometimes, she pressed back against my hand. This sickness had affected her physically, but under those blankets, behind the shivering, somewhere beyond the cold, the woman I loved was in there, fighting.

The earliest doctor’s appointment we could get was Thursday morning. I took some time off work in order to make the appointment. That morning was a relaxing 75 degrees, but looking at her, you wouldn’t know it. She wore a heavy coat and sweat pants with long johns underneath. A scarf and beanie hid her face from the world. Hidden behind the layers, her eyes looked tired. 

She got looks from the staff and patients alike in the clinic. I checked her in and she did her best not to chatter her teeth as I filled out the forms. In short, the clinic was a bust. They took her back there, and did a standard checkup. Nothing was out of the ordinary according to them. They chalked it up to poor circulation, wrote a prescription, and they sent us away without any other consideration. I made sure she took the medicine, but it didn’t help her.  

I took a full day off work that Friday, and did what I could. I came back from the store that morning and began to haul in what should’ve helped. I set up a space heater, draped a thick winter blanket over her, and assured her that I had been looking up recipes for some better soups. Despite all this, I heard her shivering as I closed the door.

She laid in there all day, only getting up to use the restroom, but that was getting less frequent. I would sit in there for ten minutes or so at a time, before having to leave again. The room was too hot now, and I couldn’t stand to be in there for any longer than I was. I checked on her often. Sat when I could. And when I was out, I would call the doctor again and explain that she was getting worse. She was getting colder. There was nothing they could or would do. Friday night came and went. More soup. More tea. More dishes. I had to take to sleeping on the couch, as our room was far too hot for me. Every couple hours I woke up alone, and when I did, I would walk over to the door, and listen for her. Once I heard her shivering. Another time she was snoring. Another, she was crying.

Saturday morning, I woke up later than normal. I began the new routine. Start the coffee, start the tea, start breakfast. It was quiet that morning. Lifeless. I could never cook like her. She had an aura about her that filled the house with energy when she cooked. Most mornings she’d be cooking, humming along to some song I never knew, without a care in the world. She was happy. Maybe that’s what my dishes were missing. Everything I cooked was made with worry.

I put it all on a tray and took it to our room. After a night without her I was determined to bear the heat and sit with her for longer. When I opened the door, I found our bed empty, seven blankets strewn about the room, thrown off without care, leading to our bathroom.

The shower was running. Steam billowed out of the bathroom and bled into our bedroom from behind the closed door. I put down the tray and knocked. Then again. Then with more urgency. Each time I got no answer. I had begun to sweat. The heat from the room was bad enough, but the steam from the bathroom felt scalding. I tried the door, but it was locked. I had to think but the heat was starting to take its toll on me. I felt sapped. Exhausted. How could she stand this horrible room? I yelled for her. And when I heard no answer, I used what strength I could muster, and kicked the door. Once. Then twice. Then the door gave way. The heat hit me like an oven, and inside, was my wife.

I found her in the shower, burned and shivering. She was sat on the shower floor with the water hitting her back. There was a big red circle where the water had burned her. Soft chunks of skin flowed off her back and toward the drain. I learned that she had turned the temperature on our water heater as high as it would go, and then turned the shower on and sat. She didn’t know how long she was in there. Or how long she would have stayed if I didn’t get her. All that she knew is that she was cold.

I got her out of the shower. She fought me till I mentioned the blankets, then she let me guide her back to bed. I dressed her wound the best I could with what we had and turned the water heater back down, cooler than before.

She got really low after that. She refused to go to the clinic again. Or anywhere for that matter. The heater and blankets were at home, and that’s where she demanded to stay.

That night, I sat with her. Sweat stained my clothes, but I paid it no mind. My wife needed me. I was at a loss, and I felt desperately powerless to help her. I prayed with her. I thought it’s what she needed, and it’s all I had left to try. I prayed like she had. I asked God for forgiveness and healing and warmth. I prayed with conviction. I nearly believed it. Maybe I just needed to believe in something. I knew that she believed in it, and if nothing else, I hoped that she would feel comfort in the prayer. When I stopped praying, she began her own prayer.

What she prayed, I can’t repeat. What I can say is that the cold had reached her heart and corrupted her faith. She said things I never thought I’d hear from a good Christian woman like her. She denied God, and His forgiveness. She promised her soul to the devil, as long as Satan promised that the fires of Hell were warm. Any enthusiasm, any hope she had was gone. The cold had taken it away.

I slept on the couch that night.

That Sunday morning, I woke up groggy. The couch had not been treating me well, and the anxiety had treated me worse. I got up anyways, and headed to the kitchen. It was time for the routine to start again. She needed me. More coffee, more tea, more breakfast that doesn't quite taste right. 

When I got to the kitchen, I heard that familiar humming. That comforting sound of cabinets and drawers opening and shutting. She was back, and she was cooking up something heavenly. It smelt like a ham steak, and I remember thinking that was a strange choice for breakfast, but I was just happy that she was feeling like herself again. She was wearing shorts and a tank top. She was reaching on her tip toes for something deep in the cabinet, when I walked in to greet her.

“What’s for breakfast, dear?”

She didn’t acknowledge me. She just kept looking in the cabinet above the stove. I looked at the stove top, and saw that the burner was on. As she was reaching further back into that cabinet, she had placed her hand on the burning cast iron pan, and it was sizzling.

The adrenaline hit my blood like cement. She found what she was looking for. Before I could comprehend what was happening, she had doused herself in cooking oil. She turned to face me. In her mangled hand she held a matchbox. In her good hand she held a match.

In an instant she and the kitchen were engulfed in flames. She didn't scream. She didn't flail around. She sat on the ground, arms hugging her knees to her chest. Among the crackling of the fire, I heard her teeth chatter. She shivered while she burned.

My wife is gone. My life is gone. I have nothing but the memories and this feeling I can’t shake.

I want it specifically this way for a reason, but I feel like maybe I am failing to understand the process of making matcha cold foam.

for context, i told this guy that i’m free on Saturday but he suggested later (as you can see in this screenshot) that we should meet on Friday evening (the same day).

i’ve been on spontaneous dates before and they’ve always ended up being too forward from the guy’s end which i really don’t like and this is why i ended up deleting apps in the first place.

So after I was able to grab my stuff. I let her be by herself. The next morning she just hissed at me. I came back from work and she was hissing a tiny bit. I have her treats and played with her. After that she started to act normal.

Today I went to hyvee and again fixed the tarp since it's really windy outside. Came back home, and ahe started to sniffs the bags and bam. Hissing again no pee though. 

I'm trying to figure what is triggering these behaviors. Is it hyvee, the tarp, or something going on with her? She's never acted this way if I went shopping, on vacation, gone for the weekend, or if I was around new people.",1,1737836043.0,AskVet,4,1.0,False
