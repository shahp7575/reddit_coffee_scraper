1mttsjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AustraliaTravel/comments/1mttsjq/3week_honeymoon_jan_2026/,3-week Honeymoon (Jan 2026),"Hi all, looking for some feedback on our plan for a 3 week holiday next year. We'll be restricting ourselves to NSW and Tasmania with the hope of not stretching ourselves too thin and spending the whole trip traveling from location to location. We'll be flying into Melbourne and flying home from Brisbane. Overall we're looking for a variety of experiences that culminate in planting our ass in the sand at the end of the trip. The detour to Tasmania does require us to keep things moving a bit but we figured with 3 weeks it's feasible and a worthwhile experience. All that said here is our current plan, would love any feedback or tweaks to the plan after a fair bit of research. 



**Dec 29th through Jan 2nd - Melbourne.** Ring in the new year in Melbs then fly to Tassie on the 2nd 

**Jan 2nd through Jan 8th - Tasmania.** Thinking we'll make Hobart our base, rent a car to explore and do some hikes. On the 8th fly to Sydney

**Jan 8th through Jan 11th - Sydney.** Will be staying in Sydney proper but and meeting up with some friends over the weekend who live in the suburbs. Plan to rent a car and use the rest of the trip. 

**Jan 11th through Jan 17th - Yamba.** We considered Byron Bay and still might maybe go there from the 15th to the 17th but thought the seemingly more laid back Yamba fit the bill for a more romantic experience on the coast. I surf back home so planning to get a beachfront place where I can rent a board and spend our days relaxing or heading out to local areas for some hikes. 

  
Our hope was this itinerary gave us a variety of experiences from city to mountains/forest to coastal beach town. We really enjoy the beach, some moderate hikes and wildlife, snorkeling, coffee, wine, and like everyone enjoy some good food. We don't want to be on the go the whole time and be able to settle in a bit when we get a location with the exception of Sydney. We had originally considered going up to Cairns but everything I read steered me away from there during the summer. Again any thoughts or feedback is appreciated!

Newbie here, is there anyone who uses Kingrinder K6?","I've been making pour-over coffee for about a month now, and if you use a Kingrinder K6 hand grinder, how many clicks do you use? I use around 85-100 clicks.   
I think it's important to mention that I use James Hoffmann's one cup V60 technique.  
The problem is that the coffees I make have very little sweetness, I only get chocolate and hazelnut flavors most of the time.  
I do it in a ratio of 1:17. For example, 12g coffee and 200 ml water. The whole process takes 2:45 - 3:00 minutes.

1mttrqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayAppliance/comments/1mttrqv/why_is_the_keurig_kiced_the_best_iced_coffee/,Why is the Keurig K-Iced the best iced coffee maker choice,"The Keurig K-Iced Coffee Maker, model 5000371871, introduced itself to my kitchen setup as a sleek and promising addition for both hot and iced coffee enthusiasts. This compact, all-in-one machine seemed like an answer to those mornings when a hot brew is necessary and afternoons when iced coffee is the perfect refresher during warmer weather. Using it daily for several weeks painted a clear picture of where this machine shines and areas where it could have been better.

**Aesthetic and Space-Saving Design**  
From the moment it was unboxed, the gray finish and compact dimensions made a great impression. Measuring 12.9 inches deep, 5.1 inches wide, and 12.6 inches tall, it fit snugly on my crowded countertop without hogging much-needed space. Its simplicity, paired with a clean button interface, made it clear this coffee maker focused on user-friendliness. The buttons are straightforward, and the removable drip tray allows flexibility for multiple cup sizes and even travel mugs. It’s a stylish piece that doesn’t overcomplicate things, earning points for blending into a modern kitchen setup effortlessly.

**Brewing Performance and Versatility**  
The highlight of this machine lies in its dual functionality. As someone who drinks both steaming hot coffee and cooling iced coffee, this device exceeded expectations with its versatility. The “Brew Over Ice” magic button wasn’t just a gimmick; it actually adjusted temperatures for proper extraction while minimizing ice melt. This ensured that the iced coffee tasted balanced and not watered down, which can be a common problem with standard brewing methods. Meanwhile, the hot coffee mode could produce a bolder cup when paired with the Strong Brew setting, ideal for days when extra caffeine was needed. I loved the temperature balance during each brew, and within just a few minutes, it served piping hot morning coffee or a chilled iced rendition for late afternoons.  

[Check Keurig 5000371871 price on Amazon.](https://ikerz.com/p/b0bsmgnyn3/)  

**Capacity and Convenience**  
The 42oz removable reservoir on this machine turned out to be a surprising time-saver. I could brew up to four cups before needing a refill, which meant less frequent trips to the sink. Paired with its fully automatic operation, mornings were smoother and less rushed. This was a game-changer during busy family breakfasts when everyone wanted coffee brewed in a flash. Its tumbler-friendly drip tray was another win. With a 7-inch clearance, I could brew directly into tall tumblers for to-go moments without struggling with leaks or balancing acts.

**Highlights**  
- The ""Brew Over Ice"" button changes the iced coffee game.  
- Compact size fits tight spaces without issue.  
- Easily accommodates travel mugs with its adjustable drip tray.  
- Strong Brew setting creates a rich and intense coffee flavor.  

**Energy Efficiency Factor**  
For those who prioritize energy-saving features, this machine shuts itself off five minutes after the last brew. It’s a subtle detail that not only decreases energy consumption but also brings peace of mind for the occasional forgetful morning. Over weeks of use, this small feature made itself known as both helpful and practical in a busy routine.

**Areas of Concern**  
Like with any product, no coffee maker is entirely free from critique. While the Keurig K-Iced Coffee Maker boasts impressive features, a few things stood out that could use refinement.  
- The reservoir, while decent-sized, wasn’t very intuitive to snap back into place after refills.  
- Only accommodates K-Cup pods unless you purchase additional accessories like the My K-Cup filter for ground coffee users.  
- For the price point, it could have included more bells and whistles, such as an integrated milk frother for lattes or cappuccinos.  

**Product Competitors**  
Comparing this Keurig machine to alternatives like the Nespresso Vertuo, I noticed some key trade-offs. The Nespresso delivers more variety with its pod-based lattes and espressos but lacks a feature focused on iced coffee brewing like Keurig’s specialized temperature adjustments. Meanwhile, budget-friendly options like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew sacrifice the sleek design and iced brewing function but excel for those who prefer both ground coffee and pods without any extras. Each of these alternatives caters to different audiences, but for iced coffee enthusiasts, Keurig undeniably holds its ground.

**Quality for Price**  
For its mid-range cost, the features deliver value for coffee lovers looking for simplicity combined with functionality. It doesn’t attempt to mimic high-end espresso machines, which keeps its price reasonable while excelling in making reliable coffee fast. Although additional accessories are needed for full versatility, what comes in the base package is enough to keep any casual coffee drinker satisfied.

Yup. They actually said that. I'm currently with a company that only has one team-wide in-office day every two weeks. For the rest, you do you. But it's an amazing office, big screens, barista, free lunch, so people come in despite not _having_ to.

Then comes this company with a 1990s office setup forcing people to come in under the pretense it'll foster ""collaboration"". It doesn't, and your predistilled liquid coffee dispenser doesn't improve things.",3,1755540618.0,recruitinghell,2,1.0,False
1mttq8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mttq8i/my_25f_coworker_friend_24f_feels_obsessive_and/,"My (25F) co-worker / friend (24F) feels obsessive and co-defendant with me, how do I handle this?","For context, me (25F), my fiance (23M) and co-worker (24F) all work the same job, me and this co-worker started out at the same time, my fiance was working for a couple months prior to me jumping in.

As for myself? I'm very independent, shy and quite introverted. I'm also too much of a people-pleaser, and I can easily let people walk over me.

I love my fiance, I trust him the most- and he is my best friend. I feel very connected to him, I struggle to open up with other people, he's that safe space for me.

Here's where I've been struggling. 

I liked this girl at work, she was very sweet and unique, we bonded a little over having dyed hair and went out for coffee one time.

As I stated, I'm really introverted, so it's rare for me to do outings like this.

It was nice, and I enjoyed it and was honestly hoping to gain a new friend through this, but after that hangout, this friend has become...so obsessive, I feel overwhelmed. It's like a light switched, and she feels completely different. 

She wants to hangout 24/7 and doesn't seem to understand me and my fiance are a different level of relationship than me and her, we barely know each other, but again, she's majorly obsessed with me for whatever reason.

Recently, she was begging me to go somewhere on the weekend, specifically this Ramen restaurant. 

I didn't want to and said no multiple times, and she kept pushing- I've been working a lot of overtime and I'm very ""peopled"" out and I told her this.

She said okay, I'll get the Ramen, and we can hang at your house with your fiance...I said no, because you are ""people"" also.

She got kinda offended, maybe I was harsh, but she wouldn't take my original no.

She made a comment like ""how am I people, and your fiance is not?"".

It's very frustrating.

She's also not very emphatic with money and very pushy with it.

If I say ""no, I can't afford this right now""

She brings up the fact that, I ""can"" because we have the same paycheck...

And then for the 12th time I have to remind her I'm saving up for a wedding right now, and also- I'm not a heavy spender.

She will spend so much money constantly, I just don't like doing that myself. 

And, when I remind her, she kinda goes ""yeah, yeah, I know"" very sarcastically. 

There's also this reoccurring problem now, where she doesn't communicate lunch situations with me, I can be more vocal of course as well, but it's just frustrating.

Somedays, if not most days- I want to have lunch alone with my fiance, talk about our days, and the upcoming weeks.

She doesn't ask to join, she finds me at work, and just sits.

Then she steam-rolls conversations, is borderline depressed if I'm not paying attention to her, and if no one is paying attention to her, she'll make ""silly noises"".

She's even admitted to checking all the break rooms on all our work floors just to find me.

She gets annoyed when I don't reply to texts and borderline reprimands me, even to my face, but again sometimes- especially after work? I need alone time.

I've invited her to my house before, but I learned my lesson, because she just honestly doesn't leave, even when I say it's time, it takes forever to kick her out.

And even then, she's constantly trying to get IN my house.

Any excuse just to be around me 24/7.

She texts me all the time, follows me around work, sends me videos of her talking about random shit I don't care about, fit checks, etc.

It doesn't feel like a balanced friendship, and it feels like she's squeezing her way into my relationship with my fiance-

Who she's also been weird with, I don't think she has a crush on him, but she's made weird comments about how he's so perfect, etc.

He's an artsy, creative guy, he draws on the bus ride to work- and she joked about how all the girls drool over him when he's drawing because it's so dreamy...

She's also weirdly obsessive with my relationship with him in general, if we hug she makes loud, obnoxious jokes, she talks about us kissing and jokes about us doing ""18+ things"" (her words) in the work bathroom...

I just need space, I crave it so much, but I don't know how to handle her.

Again, I'm a very big people-pleasor and I fear upsetting her, but I don't feel happy.

It barely feels like a friendship either, she doesn't ask me questions or has deep personal conversations, she kinda talks about herself, how beautiful she is (yes, she talks about this a lot) or her tinder endeavors...

And then she expects us to be as deep as me and my fiance, I just don't get it.

People at our work now connect us together, and that also bothers me.

We have work stations, and she goes ahead of me to tell our managers to make us work next to each other...it feels like middle school playground things, and so, so awkward...

She's just very pushy, and demanding, almost treating me like I'm her girlfriend or something. 

How do I even begin to have these conversations with her? Sometimes she's nice to talk to, I feel bad because maybe she's also lonely, but I just can't deal with this.",1,1755540585.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I have a long standing borderline personality diagnosis and it's a roller coaster.

On and off meds, therapy, hospitalization and a mess of issues work and personal.

Relationships, finance and family are always bumpy. 

One impulse and it's lost. 

Depression is the lasting normal. 

I read somewhere about becoming comfortably numb and it is something I haven't found a way to address,

but 

Somedays are worth it. 

You sleep like it mattered.
Like the day amounted to something, joy, charity, pointless fun, smiles, a good cuppa, a nice cold beer, a yummy treat, a satisfying meal, a good game on tv, a stroll in the park, something, anything. 

May be that's all what life amounts to. Little meaningful moments in a whole lot of nothing. 

Million years from now it won't matter, we won't matter. Maybe try not holding on to what is hurting us longer than we should? Maybe try.

1mttlrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChurchOfMineta/comments/1mttlrc/tsuneta_noir_violent_sunrise_final_part/,Tsuneta noir - Violent Sunrise - Final Part,"The sound echoes through the wreckage.

Red and blue lights flash, casting broken reflections across the ruins like fragments of a shattered disco ball.Police officers move with caution, stepping carefully over debris. Kaminari is on his knees, wrists cuffed behind his back. Head down, breathing heavy, eyes lost somewhere on the ground.

He doesn't resist.

Doesn’t fight.He just accepts it.

One of the officers hauls him to his feet, shoving him into the back of the cruiser. The door slams shut with a dull thud. The lights keep spinning, throwing trembling shadows over crumbled walls.

Mineta watches in silence.His face is smeared with dust, his suit completely torn and scorched. The tie hangs crooked. Dried blood on his forehead, and a weight in his eyes that no sleep could fix.But his gaze is fixed on the moon. Full. Untouched.

He looks down at his watch:

**00:00.**

A shiver runs through him.

The memory cuts sharp.

The teacher’s voice. Her smile.

Those Heroic Art History classes. The nonsense conversations that always ended up making too much sense.Her death still hurt, even eight years later.

And now… Kaminari.

A friend.

Or what he once thought was.

Mineta clenches his jaw.

A collision of feelings crashes in his chest, all of them sinking without surface.

A hand lands on his shoulder.

Soft.

Firm.

Tsuyu.

She says nothing. Just smiles.

A small smile, but full of empathy. One that *knows* .

Mineta sighs, reaching into the pocket of his ruined jacket. He pulls out a small pack and offers it to her.She takes it gently. He pulls out another.And with all the solemnity in the world, they both place the ""cigarettes"" between their lips.

Yui appears beside them, quiet. She had been there the whole time — like a shadow, discreet and watchful. Her calm eyes glint as she tilts her head slightly.

Then...

**CRACK**

They bite down.Chocolate cigarettes.

Mineta chews, gaze distant.

Tsuyu chews too, legs crossed like she’s in a Parisian café.

Yui nibbles from the side, her expression borderline blasé.

The three of them, like oversized children standing amidst ruins.

The moon watches.The city sleeps.

And the new day hasn’t begun.

Kaminari, cuffed, filthy, defeated, still trembles from the echoes of the final blow.Just when the silence starts to settle...

Another thunderclap — not of sound, but of heart.

She steps through the rubble.Firm steps.

Back straight.

**Kyoka Jiro.** Heroine of Sound. *Earphone Jack* . Rank 30.

The woman Kaminari truly loved.

The one who made his heart race, and unknowingly sparked his ruin.

The only one Mineta had ever promised never to flirt with — out of sheer respect.

The one who always pretended to scoff at the small hero, but never truly looked away.

She walks forward, eyes cold, face unreadable. Her mouth set.But there’s pain there.

And something more.

Kaminari can't breathe.He tries to rise — the cuffs rattle.

“Jiro…?”

But she doesn’t look at him.She walks straight to Mineta.

The little hero still tasting chocolate, eyes lost in the moonlight.She stops in front of him, reaches up, and holds his face — gently.

Mineta’s eyes widen. Shocked.

And then...

She kisses him.

Firm lips.

Decisive.

Kyoka Jiro’s first kiss.

Not said in words, but full of meaning.Forgiveness.Closure.

And a final blow.

Kaminari explodes.

“YOU SON OF A BITCH!!!”

He thrashes, screams, foams.The cuffs hold him. Officers grab tight.But the damage is done.

Not just the kiss.But her *eyes* .

The indifference.

The choice.

Tsuyu watches with narrowed eyes.A flicker of jealousy pulses in her chest…But also understanding.

She gets it. She doesn’t love it, but she gets it.She knows what Kyoka meant in Mineta’s life.And she sees it in his eyes — that kiss wasn’t about passion.

It was about freedom.

Yui, beside her, gasps softly.

A faint “oh” escapes her lips. She averts her eyes, unsure whether to smile or let the moment breathe.

And Mineta...

He simply closes his eyes.

And returns the kiss.Softly.Without rush. Without pride.

Like he’d finally received the period at the end of a sentence written long ago.

When the kiss ends, Kyoka only whispers:

**“She would’ve been proud.”**

And walks away.Without looking back.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

The sound of the police cruiser fades into the night, swallowed by silence.

The moon is still full.

Yui drives in silence.

The headlights slice through the darkness like a thin line between the recent past and the routine waiting just ahead.

In the back seat, side by side, sit Jessica Ribbit and Jack “Sticky” Noir.

No celebration. No smile.

The mission was over, but the taste it left behind was bitter.

Mineta leans back, eyes lost in the void ahead.

Tsuyu rests in his lap, arms around his waist, chin on his chest.

There are no words.But there is warmth.

Two hearts trying to stay steady under the same weight: betrayal.

The car glides through wet streets where lamplight seems to breathe with the city.

The violence was left behind.

The tension still lingers in their muscles, but the night now has a different texture—as if the world is slowly returning to its rhythm.

The silence in the car isn’t awkward.It’s melancholic.

But comforting.

Like the pause after a scream.

Like the breeze through a forgotten window.

Yui says nothing.

But her eyes, reflected in the rearview mirror, watch them with softness.

She understands.

She respects.

Finally, the car stops.

In front of them stands a five-story building. Simple, but with character.

The facade is made of light brick, partially covered in green vines and balconies with potted plants.Large windows reveal lace curtains, and a wrought iron sign hangs above the entrance.

Warm yellow light slips through the gaps in the windows, giving the place a feeling of home, of shelter.

It’s not a luxurious place.

But it’s the kind of place where you can hear rain on the roof and smell coffee brewing in the kitchen.A space of rest for those who live in chaos.

Tsuyu looks up, still resting on Mineta’s lap.

He looks at the building, then back at her.

No words.

But everything is understood.

The night, at last, seems to breathe easy.

The building’s door creaks open gently.Mineta and Tsuyu step out slowly, as if the weight of the night still clings to their shoulders.

The breeze is light, but carries the scent of the damp city, of a night about to yield to morning.

Yui, still at the wheel, watches silently.

Only her eyes follow. No judgment.

Mineta rubs the back of his neck, hunched slightly. Still uncomfortable. Still himself.

Tsuyu tucks her hair behind her ear, as if she’d forgotten it was loose. Her eyes are narrowed, tense with everything left unsaid.

They stop in front of the door.

They don’t know if this is goodbye.

They don’t know if they should take another step.

But something in their bodies—the caught breath, the racing hearts—screams yes.

Tsuyu lifts her gaze.

Mineta meets it, hesitating like always.But there’s something new now.

Something revealed.

For the first time, she sees his eyes clearly.

They’re not just black or dark brown as she always thought…

They’re a deep violet.

Alive.

Glowing under the soft entrance light.

Like a hidden gem.

Always there, yet unseen.

She breathes in.

“You… always had eyes this color?”

Mineta swallows, caught off guard.

“I guess… I never really noticed if anyone ever noticed.”

She smiles.

A small smile.

But heavy.Honest.

“They’re beautiful.”

He blushes.

She does too.

A second of silence.

A second heavy with everything that was never said.

The night breathes around them—warm, dense, alive.

The city itself seems to hold its breath.

Tsuyu steps closer in silence.

Each movement delicate, as if walking across memories.

She stops in front of him—so close he feels her breath on his skin.

Her forehead touches his.

A gesture intimate, almost childlike—yet bearing the weight of reconciliation.

Mineta closes his eyes.

There are no words for this.

The **kiss** doesn’t come suddenly.

It *grows* .

Slow.

Measured.Felt.

Their lips meet gently, as if afraid to break one another.

It’s a kiss of forgiveness, of reunion, of wordless confession.

A sigh escapes between them.

Tsuyu’s fingers curl around his collar, pulling him closer.

And then something shifts.The air warms.Tension rises like a live current between them.

The kiss deepens.

Mineta’s hands slide along her waist, feeling the taut muscles beneath warm skin.

Tsuyu murmurs something against his lips—he doesn’t understand it, only *feels* it.

Their bodies shape into one another.Her tongue touches his, a clear invitation.

It’s no longer about forgiveness.

It’s about *wanting* .

She breaks the kiss for just a moment, eyes half-lidded, breathing against his mouth.

“You’re not leaving me alone now, are you?”

Mineta shakes his head softly.

She smiles.

Bites his lower lip.

Grabs his tie—and pulls him with her.

They vanish inside, like one shadow folding into another.

Out of sight, but not out of memory.

Inside the car, Yui’s eyes go wide.

Stares at the building’s entrance, mouth slightly open.

“…That was way too cute for this hour.”

She stays there for a few seconds.

Forehead resting against the wheel.Eyes narrowed.

She exhales quietly.

“…Tsk.”

Without another word, she turns off the engine, steps out calmly, and walks to the side of the car.

Touches it with her quirk.A soft “pop!”—The car shrinks to the size of a makeup case.

She picks it up, places it carefully into the safety pouch on her belt, and straightens her jacket like an elite agent.

Her still-messy hair dances with the early morning breeze.

With steady steps, she approaches the building door.

She stops.

The imaginary camera closes in—A perfect noir frame.

Yui looks straight at it.

Stoic.

Shadow in her eyes.

No emotion. No wasted words.

And then, with the calm of someone commenting on the weather:

**“Hm.”**

She opens the door.Enters.

The door closes slowly behind her—with a final, quiet click.",1,1755540321.0,ChurchOfMineta,1,1.0,False

At one point, the idea that the Ikea Lack side table had the right dimensions to serve as a light duty server rack went low key viral. But I don't recall seeing it featured in any posts here.

My situation: Minimal homelab so far consisting just of a Dell R310 and a small rackmount UPS that desire rack mounting, and otherwise a handful of network components that are not designed for rack mounting including my ""old"" NAS that is still the primary live file server. I really don't have a piece of furniture that fits the two rackmount items cleanly, but I also don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a ""proper"" rack for such a small setup. The cheapest ""sturdy but minimal"" racks on Amazon are still $99+, and while I do see used full size racks come up used often enough, even used they're always listed above $300. I didn't spend that much between the two pieces that need the rack, so it's hard to justify spending that much at this moment, though later after some projects are done maybe it will be a blessed indulgence.

There is an Ikea that isn't terribly far from other errands I have planned today, so I'm contemplating swinging by there to pick up a $15 Lack end table or maybe going to the extreme of the $30 coffee table version, which looks to be a better fit for the depth of the server itself. I also don't have proper rails for the Dell, so the middle shelf of the coffee table would be a good bypass to that problem for the moment, since those rails will also cost a lot more than the Lack table unless I find a used set cheap.",0,1755540299.0,homelab,1,0.33,False

Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body and a key structural component of skin, bones, tendons, and cartilage. While often discussed in the mainstream supplement world, it's technically a protein composed of specific amino acid chains, making it relevant to our community's interest in peptides. Its primary areas of research include skin health, joint support, and bone density. Unlike many experimental peptides, collagen is widely researched, commercially available, and generally regarded as safe for consumption.

## What is Collagen?

Collagen is a major structural protein composed of amino acids, primarily glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline. It forms a triple-helix structure that provides strength and elasticity to various connective tissues throughout the body.

## Potential Benefits & Areas of Research

Based on available studies and community reports, the primary areas of interest for Collagen include:

*   **Improved Skin Health:** Numerous human clinical trials suggest that supplementing with hydrolyzed collagen (collagen peptides) can improve skin hydration, elasticity, and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles by providing the building blocks for the body to produce its own collagen.
*   **Joint Pain Relief:** Research, particularly in athletes and individuals with osteoarthritis, has shown that collagen supplementation can help maintain the integrity of cartilage, reduce joint pain, and improve mobility. Type II collagen is often specifically studied for this purpose.
*   **Enhanced Bone Density:** Some human studies, especially in postmenopausal women, indicate that collagen supplementation may help increase bone mineral density and inhibit the bone breakdown that leads to conditions like osteoporosis.
*   **Hair and Nail Strength:** While evidence is less robust than for skin or joints, many users report stronger, faster-growing hair and nails. The theory is that collagen provides the necessary amino acids for building keratin, the primary protein in hair and nails.
*   **Mechanism of Action:** When ingested, hydrolyzed collagen is broken down into smaller peptides and amino acids in the gut. These are then absorbed into the bloodstream and can travel throughout the body to act as building blocks for new collagen or to stimulate fibroblasts (the cells that produce collagen) to increase endogenous production.

## Dosage and Administration

*This information is for educational discussion based on research studies and anecdotal reports. It is not a medical recommendation or dosage advice.*

*   **Common Forms:** The most common form is Hydrolyzed Collagen, also known as Collagen Peptides, sold as a powder that dissolves easily in liquids. It's also available in capsules, gummies, and pre-mixed liquid drinks.
*   **Typical Dosage Range in Research:** Studies have used a wide range, but most beneficial effects are seen between 2.5g and 15g per day. Lower doses (2.5-5g) are often used for skin health, while higher doses (10-15g) are more common for joint and bone support.
*   **Administration Methods:** Oral consumption is the only method. The powder is typically mixed into coffee, smoothies, water, or other beverages.

## Stacking and Synergies

In research and discussion, Collagen is sometimes combined with other compounds. A common example is:

*   **Vitamin C:** This is arguably the most important ""stack."" Vitamin C is an essential cofactor for the enzymes responsible for synthesizing collagen in the body. Without adequate Vitamin C, collagen supplementation is less effective.
*   **Hyaluronic Acid:** Often combined in formulas targeting skin health, as both compounds work to promote skin hydration and elasticity.

## Potential Side Effects & Risks

Reported side effects are generally mild and can include:

*   **Digestive Upset:** Some individuals may experience feelings of fullness, bloating, or an unpleasant taste.
*   **Allergenic Potential:** Since collagen is derived from animal sources (bovine, marine, chicken, porcine), individuals with allergies to these sources should choose their product carefully.
*   **Important Note:** While collagen is widely considered safe, product quality can vary immensely. Contamination with heavy metals is a potential concern, making third-party testing crucial.

## Quality, Sourcing, & Legality

*   **Quality Indicators:** When sourcing for research, look for recent, verifiable third-party testing results (Certificates of Analysis or COAs) to confirm the purity and concentration of the product. Also, consider the source (e.g., grass-fed bovine, wild-caught marine) and check that it's hydrolyzed for better absorption.
*   **Legal Status:** Collagen is sold as a dietary supplement and is widely available and legal for human consumption. It is not considered a research chemical in the same way as many other peptides discussed in this community.

## Community Insights & Anecdotes

In online forums, community members often discuss preferences between marine vs. bovine collagen, with some reporting better skin results from marine sources. Many share anecdotal reports of improved skin texture, reduced joint ""clicking,"" and stronger nails after consistent use for 2-3 months. The biggest debate is often around brand quality and the necessity of more expensive, branded formulas versus generic bulk powders.

I’m **Ayka**, an interior designer and I wanted to share some practical tips to help you refresh your space and make it feel unique and inviting. Whether you’re redecorating a whole room or just looking for a small update, these tips can make a big impact!

# 1. Start with a Blank Canvas

Remove all decor items and then add things back with intention. Starting with an empty room helps you identify focal points and rethink layouts without distraction.

# 2. Focus on Function and Flow

Consider how you’ll use the space and how people will move through it. Keep high-traffic areas clear, and arrange furniture to make sure every seat has a purpose and a view.

# 3. Create a Mood Board

Look up styles on Pinterest or other sites and create a board to gather inspiration. This helps narrow down colors, styles, and textures you love, making it easier to build a cohesive look.

# 4. Choose a Focal Point

Identify a key feature (like a statement wall, large piece of art, or fireplace) and design the room around it. This draws the eye and makes the space feel intentional.

# 5. Mix Textures and Materials

Bring variety by mixing materials like metal, wood, glass, and fabrics. For example, if you have a wooden coffee table, consider adding metal accents or a soft rug to balance it out.

# 6. Use Artwork Wisely

If you have existing artwork, try to complement it with new decor that has similar colors or themes. Use different types of wall art – like mirrors, clocks, or sculptures – to add depth and avoid overwhelming the walls.

# 7. Pay Attention to Lighting

Good lighting makes a huge difference. Use a mix of lighting sources (overhead, task, and accent lighting) to create a warm, inviting atmosphere. Dimmers can be a great addition for mood control!

# 8. Consider Scale and Empty Space

Balance large items with smaller accents, and remember that not every surface needs decor. Leaving some areas empty can help create a clean, airy feel.

1mttequ,https://www.reddit.com/r/DivorcedDads/comments/1mttequ/she_came_backdrunk/,She came back…drunk,"So, everyone kept telling me she would try to come back, but I didn’t believe. 
I figured she was too headstrong, but she called at 2am in a panic and asked to come by.
She left me and the kids, so I figured she just really wanted to see the kids (17f & 18m).
She showed up in the rain completely drunk.
She’s sobbing telling me that her boyfriend isn’t the guy she thought he was… this is the man she cheated with, who himself is married with three kids.
They have spent the past several months exploring very violent sexual fantasies she tells me… but now she’s had enough (I believe she said “that cup is full now”).
Turns out that her sadistic (not hyperbole in this case) boyfriend intimidates her and has choked her to unconsciousness many times. She said that she was always into it, but now she wants out and is scared of him.
She had a very dark childhood and these sexual predilections were something we struggled with during our 20 year marriage. Turns out I’m just a vanilla kinda guy in the bedroom🤷🏼‍♂️
She starts to reminisce about the “good times” and tries to get closer.
She says that her and I never really tried to work on our relationship with the help of professionals, and if we give it another shot this time will be different.
This will be her 6th affair (that I know of), so I kinda laughed when she said this.
I told her that I’m happy now and don’t think getting back together would be a good thing for either of us.
She tries to convince me some more in drunken slurs, but I stand my ground.
I’ve been seeing an amazing woman for the past several months and can honestly say I’m happy. 
During this time she starts to receive text messages from her violent boyfriend, but turns off her phone.
At this point it’s very late and I’m tired. I offer her my bed and I went down stairs to sleep on the couch. 
In the morning she comes down stairs, hungover.
I make her some coffee and she turns on her phone. Lots of messages are waiting for her. 
Some of these messages are pictures of my house from outside.
This psychopath came to my house and took pictures during the night and sent them to her. No words, just images of her and I talking through the window.
I told her she needs to talk to the police.
Still waiting to see how this unfolds.

But how do I make him more interested in this?,"He is a pilot that works for airlines. We live in the same city so its not just for layovers and he used to be home a lot, as he is already a captain. I met his mother but not in an official event, he didn't want that. So, once we were together in the car and he stopped by to deliver her some groceries. She invited us inside and he said that I am his girlfriend, but that was it.

He is very cold with me, totally detached emotionally. Not only with me. He doesn't really have any friends because he fails to keep relationships. He doesn't call, doesn't take up calls only when he is in the mood, rarely wants to go out and spends most of his free time in the house reading. He changed the airlines last month, and he didn't even told me about it. Anyway, it is the second time this year he changes it, and last year he also changed. But this time he is moving to another country. He said he forgot to tell me, sorry for that. And went back to his coffee.

He is not doing it on purpose. I talked to his mother while he was away and she cried to me that he didn't tell her either that he is moving, he just did. He still comes home a few days per month, but if I don't reach out he rarely does. On Friday he came home but only on Sunday texted me if I want to meet. He sent me a photo he took on the street. It was a lingerie shop and he asked if I have something like that. I cooked him dinner, spent the night with him and in the morning I told him I am pregnant. His reaction could have been better but it wasn't that bad. He said he needs to think about it. OK, But I am having this child, I said. He agreed and told me to chill. Went to bathroom and when returned said that he is 37 won't get any younger than that so If I want to bear a child for him that wouldn't be so bad. (I quoted). I have a good income.

Every morning, I’m the one making coffee. But Scout has been running her own café. She’s posted up at the window seat, tongue out, tail wagging, waiting for her usual order: a Barkaccino with extra froth. And she’s far too invested in catching up on the news — which features all the latest chipmunk activities. It’s a silly little scene from our living room, but also a reminder of what “home” feels like: warm, funny, a little chaotic, and better with coffee (and pets).

During our recent [How To Get Accepted Into A Top Law School webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J9sPoreNH0), Erin shared actionable, behind-the-scenes advice for getting letters of recommendation that actually help you stand out.

**On Choosing the Right Recommenders:**

>*""Select recommenders that know you fairly deeply based on your character, work ethic, and achievements. A generic letter from a well-known name is less effective than a detailed one from someone who has worked closely with you.""*

**On Academic References:**

>*""Most schools require at least two academic references—at minimum, have these ready. Even if you’ve been out of school for years, go back to your alma mater, request your transcript, find classes you excelled in, and reconnect with those professors.""*

**On Waiving Your Right to Read the Letter:**

>*""Waive your right to read the letter—it signals to admissions that the praise is candid and unfiltered. Schools can tell when a recommender is holding back.""*

**On Preparing Your Recommenders:**

>*""Provide recommenders with your personal statement, resume, and a short note about your goals. This helps them tailor their letter to match your application themes instead of writing something vague or disconnected.""*

**On Timing and Professional Courtesy:**

>*""Ask at least a month in advance, ideally more. If it’s been a while since you’ve spoken, schedule a coffee or virtual meeting to catch up before you make the request. Treat it like asking for a major professional favor—because that’s exactly what it is.""*

**On Having a Backup Plan:**

>*""Some schools require three letters, and recommenders can have emergencies or conflicts. Always have a backup in mind so you’re not scrambling at the last minute.""*

**Final Thoughts**

Strong letters of recommendation don’t just confirm your GPA or LSAT score; they reveal how you show up in the classroom, in projects, and in your professional relationships. Choose recommenders who can speak to your strengths with specific examples, and prepare them to advocate for you effectively.

Who’s on your shortlist, and how are you setting them up to write their best letter for you?

Let's meander through a bookstore.,"Calling fellow introverts. People who enjoy company and companionship, but are drained after new social interactions. Let's skip the small talk, and just sit there enjoying each other's company. We’ll pick out a book for each other, hopefully something we wouldn’t have chosen on our own. 

We'll chat a little bit here on Reddit to get a feel for each other, and when we're ready we can trade photos. The next step will be a short video call to verify (safety first!). If we decide to go on the date, we’ll map out where we will go so we both know what to expect. 

We’ll start at a bookstore, taking our time as we peruse the spines lining the shelves. They all seem to be vying for our attention, don’t they? We’ll read author bios and front covers, waiting for just the right selection. After we’ve made our choices, we head out for a short walk and a coffee, and make our way to the park where we can talk over a bottle of wine. Maybe snuggle up on a park bench. At the end we’ll part ways, hopefully having planned our second date. 

Before you respond, here are some things about me:

* I'm 5'7"", shaved head, piercings, many tattoos, dad bod. 
* I'm quiet, which is why this idea appeals to me.
* My interests include chess, hiking, music, art, working out, cooking and just generally enjoying food, video games, anime, and volunteering.
* I'm non-monogamous with a lovely nesting partner, and they are aware when I date other people. I'm not seeking a long term, committed romance out of this. Just a fun evening, and I'm open to something casual and ongoing if we get along. 
* My age range is 25-40, with a bit of flexibility if you really think we'll get along.

If this appeals at all to you, or you have ideas of your own, please get in touch and tell me a bit about yourself! Most importantly, tell me whether you are a bookworm or book dragon.

1mtt70z,https://i.redd.it/mu0os1q2gtjf1.jpeg,I lost my Nano to my wife.,"

My wife uses capsule coffee machines and, until now, she had never been interested in espresso (the large machines are intimidating, and for some, they can seem complicated). So, I made an espresso in the Nano with ground coffee and gave it to her. She loved it. I also showed her that, in addition to the original espresso, the Nano is compatible with capsules. Well, after this revelation, she asks me to make an espresso every day (when she doesn't ask me, she uses the Nano with the capsules herself).

I decided to share this because I found it funny and unexpected. The Nano is not only for those who enjoy quality espresso, but also for users of simple capsules. Yes, the ""hybrid"" use is clearly stated in the manual and in the machine's official presentation, but since I rarely use capsules, I hadn't paid much attention to this feature.  This is what I like most about OutIn: The sensitivity to serve both discerning coffee drinkers and more laid-back consumers, like capsule users.

I like OutIn precisely for this versatility, for the attention and care it provides to all types of consumers. From specialty coffee drinkers to capsule users. From users who will use the devices as their primary focus, at their coffee station, to those who will use them at the office or at the camping.

In the photo, my wife is happily using the Nano, surrounded by nature, on a sunny and very positive day.",1,1755539439.0,OutInCoffee,0,1.0,False
1mtt6xq,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mtt6xq/the_idiotic_ranting_of_a_teenager_with_nowhere/,The idiotic ranting of a teenager with nowhere else to do so- screaming into the internet's void,"I would like to start this post with three apologies. I apologise for its format, I have never posted on reddit before and I don't know how people usually phrase and organise their posts. Secondly, I’m sorry for how long this post will be, I’m not actually sure why I'm posting this, I think I just want  somewhere to shout into the void. Conjunctive with my last apology, I apologise for the content. I am aware I am an asshole, and of  the ridiculousness of what I say as I have life very easy. Furthermore, I find talking about emotions (for lack of a better word) cringeworthy so I apologise if my writing is robotic, cold, inappropriately joking or framed in a self deprecating way. TLDR: This post is a culmination of years of never speaking in an emotional way, it will be long, probably confusing, most certainly frustrating to read ,and undoubtably cringe. You do not have to read this, in fact I'd recommend continuing on with your day, this is a sheltered, ungrateful teenage temper tantrum.



 Ok so now that that's out of the way I suppose I should introduce myself to let you get an idea of my character. I recently turned 17 and my whole life people have forgiven my obnoxious dickhead behaviour. To be frank, my sense of humour is often mean, sarcastic, crude and mocking. I've been told I'm funny but people then realise I never stop. I've realised I am incapable of being serious when I'm talking to another person or even when texting them. Lowk typing this (and I haven't even got to the serious stuff yet) is killing me. People have made excuses for me saying that I'm ""traumatised"", “bullied” “depressed” or “emotionally neglected” or that I “Invalidate my own emotions”. But I tell you reddit, I truly am not.



 I come from a good country (wealthy, no war, progressive, little corruption), my family is upper middle class (though it hasn't always been that way) and my parents let me do any hobbies I want and will drive me to them. I would combat that I am treated better than most children out there as my parents do everything for me. I mean sure I can't remember the last emotional talk beyond small talk I’ve had with my parents but come on who out there is having deep talks with their parents. It's not their fault though, in recent months (as in this year) my parents keep hitting me with ""Don't bottle your emotions up, it's a bad trait to have” and “We are here to talk if you ever need it”. Genuinely don't know what they want me to say. I can deal with my problems by myself. They have their own shit so why would I come to them. Most of the time, upon reflection I've been very dramatic.



I suppose another integral part to me is how I was on the internet at a far too young age. That being unrestricted access from age 7. I very quickly became obsessed with both horror content, violent videogames and true crime on youtube. The humour these creators took was dry, morbid and nihilistic. This caused me to have existential crises, and severe paranoia. The silly little thing I was, I used to lay awake fully convinced my family would be murdered or that some eldritch horror/creepypasta creature would come and kill me. Furthermore, this led to me being disillusioned in religion and feeling completely meaningless and led to a  sort of depressive state which lasted until around age 13. During this time I barely slept and would spend my nights crying over things such as 1. Potential tragic events that happen in the future 2. Stupid things I did in the past which I was scared people would kill themselves over because of me  and 3. Wanting to die. Heavy stuff right? Lmao dont let your kids on the internet folks. 

I see this stuff as irrelevant to me now as it no longer affects me. However, it may be relevant to mention I have had some very large periods of dissociation (the longest stretching around a year and a half during which I cannot remember anything other than little flashes of memories) which I sometimes still struggle with a bit. I'm conscious that I am using the term dissociation and I'd like to specify that this to me means feeling detached from my body and mind where everything feels a bit like the colour grey and nothing feels real iykwim. I'm sorry for using that word as people struggle greatly with dissociation, its not as bad as that for me it's just the closest word.  



So now reading all this back it sounds bad. I'd like to communicate the root cause of all this is myself. I have slightly fucked myself up, it was my doing and no one elses. And trust it's not as bad as I made it sound. I am fine and my life is perfect. I get near perfect scores in school, excel in extracurriculars and have two parents who are involved in my life.



As I touched on earlier, people make excuses for me. Which pmo to no end. Like bro I'm just an asshole I'm not a fuckin tumblr emo boy with a side fringe being like “I just push people away because… I'm misunderstood.” NO. I just genuinely don't care about you. I'm just a bad person who doesn't feel emotional connection, not “Avoidant attachment”. I don't understand why you keep putting up with me? I'm fine when I'm friends with someone and we just joke and mess around but people always want to talk deeper which I'm fine with, you can talk to me. That's when they start telling me I'm “emotionally unavailable” or that I'm “scared of emotional vulnerability”  just because I don't talk about my emotions but the truth is I'm not sure if I have any. If I do I don't think I feel them in the way others do. Cause when i do open up or whatever im told im just “listing off events” so i dont understand what more I need to say. Also when I say I don't feel emotions in the same way as others, I don't mean that in a depressed emo way. I just feel fine everyday. Just a constant state of fine which is both stable and positive right? When I do feel emotions its purely physical in a way. Like anger, I only feel it in the pit of my stomach, not in my head. Idk why Im mentioning this, maybe this is how emotions are??? If a stranger is nice to me, I feel the same about them as I do about friends I've had for years. I either feel positive towards someone or i dont feel anything towards them. Thats what i mean by not having emotional connection



Just because I don't overly care about them, doesn't mean that I want harm to come to my friends. Acc it would be terrible and I don't know if id forgive myself if anything happened to them but that's how I feel about everyone. However, I've had friends who struggled with suicidal thoughts and I've helped them as much as I could. But when they say stuff in the gc like “You two are the primary reason I didn't do it, you mean so much to me” It sort of makes me want to disappear? Idk I feel like I'm too important then and the responsibility feels like it's gonna choke me. Ofc I'm fine helping them and getting them what they need physically and emotionally but id rather they just wouldnt tell me what i mean to them. That's not how i want to put it but idk how to phrase it. Like I really want to help you, and I want you to get better but don't tell me how I've helped you?? Idk this is something I haven't thought about this much or put into words. I don't even know if this is relevant. Just being friends beyond the surface level is suffocating to me. I feel trapped and a lot of times they start to annoy me. You don't know how many times I have tried/ wanted to ghost my current “closest” friends. I don't follow through cause I know it will hurt them, we've been friends for 6 years.



Another thing is the fact I don't have a personality. It changes from person to person. And its a flawless transition, most of the time it's not even conscious. I'm whatever version of me the person needs. The goofy friend, the serious one, the caring one, the mean one, WHATEVER. That sounds cringe but you get my drift. My current closest friends keep thinking they have me all figured out and try “Psychoanalysing” me. Once again girliepops, I'm an asshole without a cause. But they only know their version of me. I explained this jokingly to them once and they asked me then “Who gets the real \[NAME\] then?” and the truth is, that i dont think there is a real me. I walk into my room, where I’m finally alone and everything just sheds away and I'm back to just being neutral. Yk that pokemon that can only mimic other pokemon? Bruh that's me. This sounds so cringe so I apologise, it sounds like some teenage angst but all of this isn't in the depressing way cause I feel fine all the time. I just think I'm missing the part of me that lets me have a personality and I've always been this way. I think this just means I'm a social chameleon.



Now we get to the reason I made this post, the thing I need to get off my chest. My relationship with my family. They care for me, they do everything for me but I don't like them. They are more like roommates than family to me. I don't like my father because he doesn't lift a finger about the home. He's commanding yet not abusive. He makes my mum do everything chore wise, doesn't even pick up his dirty clothes. He's not very aggressive and he's not violent but he's just very very lazy. He is pro gender roles and has thrown a fit about period products being IN THE TRASH in the bathroom, completely wrapped up btw. Sorry lmao that is something that happened last week that I'm still shocked about. For example, he would make my mum (or increasingly me) make him a coffee, it would be brought to him and then he'd send you in and out of the kitchen multiple times. Bringing the coffee to him in the living room then you have to go and get him a biscuit which he didn't mention the first time, and then a toothpick. Doesn't matter what you were doing before. You now have to walk back and forth a bunch of times. But maybe this is normal? Is this just what respecting elders is? It's definitely not that bad for me but awful for my mum. He also cant do anything finance, chore and food wise and gets my mum to do it. Like my mum somehow naturally knows how to do it. He has gloated about his malicious incompetence to others and it's exhausting. 



My mum? Hates him. Loves him but hates him as a person. She has told me multiple times how unhappy she was in the first year of marriage, how she cried everyday and how she wanted to call off the wedding a few weeks before because she went to his apartment to the first time and it was so dirty. She has even told me that before she gave birth to me (ten years after my brother) he was even less helpful. I have no idea how that's even possible. My mum doesn't have any friends and her family don't speak to her so for an outlet she talks to me. She complains about him constantly, and has told me she wants to get her own house once I go to university and that no one will be allowed to visit her except me if I want to. It is important to note that my mothers parents did not treat her well. She's a hairdresser with a passion for art but her parents put her dreams down. I took it upon myself to encourage her art as my father and my brother put her down and are ungrateful for all she does. So over the past year I have been encouraging her, telling her how amazing her art is, urging her to keep progressing and continue doing what she loves. However this is where I feel guilty. Since my mum has no other positive influence in her life she has completely attached herself to me. And I'm so exhausted. She is constantly bombarding me with ideas for her wigs, and her paintings and everything. She cant do anything without me and it's fatiguing me. I'm so tired all the time and she constantly seeks my advice on everything and I have to give her the enthusiasm. It's horrible of me but I resent her for it. I have to keep doing it as I'm the only person being positive with her but I can't wait to move out. And I'm such an asshole for it. She keeps telling me that I'm her best friend, how she loves spending time with me and that she hopes I visit more than my brother does when I'm older. But all I want is to live my life. I feel suffocated and like I'm never going to be able to move on in my life. I feel like I will be stuck here forever. I am even more ashamed that I wish to go to a prestigious university and will need my family's support. I plan to catalogue every cent they give me and pay it back someday.



I feel like shit for hating them. They provide everything for me and always say “love you” etc etc whatever but i cant. They are so loud, they treat my mum poorly and yet because of how my mum is treated she clings to me and I'm so tired of listening. And she gets hurt if i don't come with her instantly claiming that “everyone hates her”. This all sounds bad but it doesn't happen that often and truly it's fine, I'm just not very tolerant of a person (lmao must be genetic) and I cant stand these things when presented to me. Sometimes I fear I'm exactly like some of my family members. My grandfather is narcissistic and very controlling. I genuinely fear I am like him. Is it common as a teenager to feel this way?



While I'm outing myself in every way I may as well say a few things I need “off my chest”. I don't think I'll ever amount to anything or have a long term movie-like “happiness”. I don't want to be in a romantic relationship because I'm terrified I might end up abusing them. Even with friendships, I'm scared I'll take advantage of them. I consistently ruin everything for myself. I don't enjoy an event cause I know it will be over some day it will be over and so I put a severe amount of pressure on myself to enjoy it.This has led to my nihilism becoming all encompassing and now I don't care about anything such as trying to get clothes in a style you like or dyeing your hair. Cause why does it matter? I also have grappled with the feeling that I don't deserve anything. Some people can't afford to eat while I buy an expensive skirt with my savings. I feel so sick about that skirt that I've hardly worn it. Which makes me feel worse because then I just wasted the money. It's not right that just because of where you are born you get a different quality of life.



If you have read all the way, I’m sorry I just intended to send this into the void of the internet. A little all over the place right? I will probably feel an immense cringe in the morning reading this cause Im a believer of just ignoring this type shit. Also sorry how jumpy this post was, I sat and wrote it in one sitting. I was told this is good for MeNtAl HeAlTh and facing emotions or whatever. Once again I'm not sure why I've written all of this, or what I'm hoping to achieve. I apologise for how whiny ive been, ive just needed to scream into the void and this has really helped. Oh well. Also for all the grammar and spelling errors, shhhhh pretend they dont exist babygirl.

Hey, quick question. I’m a former student and was wondering if it’s okay to go to campus and work before the semester starts. Are there good spots that are quiet and not too busy?

I’m not really into coffee shops or restaurants since they get overwhelming. I’ve heard the law building has good study spaces, and of course the library, but are there specific and areas (cubicles, quiet corners, etc.) that are good?

1mtt3xi,https://www.reddit.com/r/tummytucksurgery/comments/1mtt3xi/fdl_mr_bl_and_lipo_814/,"FDL, MR, BL and Lipo 8/14","I was hoping to share some before and after pictures with my first post, but I haven't see the on the table after pictures yet. I hope to get them on 8/20 at my first post-op appointment and will update. I did get a look at my results 2 days later and I am pretty swollen, but still a huge difference. Anyhow, I am F46, 5'3"", 175 pounds (after a 55 pound weight loss). I had a fleur de lis tummy tuck with some muscle repair, lipo to the flanks and a breast lift on 8/14. I opted for the epidural (placed between shoulder blades not low like childbirth) and IV sedation over general anesthesia. The anesthesiologist gave me both options and I chose the epidural because I would not be intubated or groggy afterwards. I woke up and just started chatting away with my nurse and felt great. The nurse told me they removed 5.5 pounds from my abdomen, 1 pound from one breast and almost a pound from the other. I wanted to remain the same size (42H pre-weight loss, 36H surgery day) so I think the bulk of that was lateral/side boob although I do feel/look smaller. They took around 300g from lipo. I had 2 drains placed left and right abdomen. I was sent home in a binder (Dale 411) and a loose fitting front close velcro bra. 

**Surgery day 8/14:** Felt great all day and evening until around 10:30-11PM when upper back pain started. I ran to Google and apparently this is common with an epidural. It made it difficult to sleep in my bed so I slept on the corner of the sectional leaning against the wall with a pillow and took a single oxycodone 5mg.

**Day 2 8/15:** Still no pain just soreness in my breast and swelling. Around 10:30-11 my upper back started again so I moved to the sectional and took an oxycodone.

**Day 3 8/16:** Same as day 2, but I finally had a BM! Such a relief. 

**Day 4 8/17:** I was able to sleep in my bed. No upper back pain, but definitely lower back pain 2/10 from hunching over.   

**Day 5 8/18:** Feeling amazing. Lower back is still 2/10, but mainly when standing or walking. I am back to work (work from home desk job). 

  
Overall the recovery has been easy and completely unexpected. I wanted to share to remind people that recovery varies greatly. I am not out of the woods yet, but so far so good. I have been eating and drinking a lot of water, protein, fiber and limiting sodium. I am up every waking hour walking around (including stairs/split level home). 

The bulk of my diet has been:

Scrambled eggs w/spinach and no salt turkey, Carbmaster bread w/fiber, Kodiak waffles, Eggo protein pancakes, Chobani 20g protein yogurt, Premier protein shakes or Oikos protein shakes w/fiber. I've added chia seeds to my yogurt for additional fiber, turkey sandwiches w/avocado, Birds Eye Power Blends, blueberries. strawberries, avocado and Jello zero sugar pudding cups. I also reintroduced coffee yesterday and no side effects. I've been taking 2-3 stool softeners a day and trying to get a lot of fiber in my diet. ",3,1755539257.0,tummytucksurgery,0,1.0,False

Alt text: Professional business meeting in Bahrain office, businessmen and women collaborating. approval. Our adviser at Seef District’s Sijilat service center had warned us: “With license or without—it changes everything, so choose wisely.” That moment still shapes how I advise newcomers setting up in Bahrain.*\
Starting or growing a business here blends tradition with speed. From late-night majlis meetings—where deals often materialize over Arabic coffee and dates—to concise, digital-first company formation processes via Sijilat, there’s an unmistakable Bahrain identity to every step. Understanding the distinction between a CR with a license and one without is not just a regulatory nuance. It’s central to your entire operation, cost structure, and speed to market.\
The Bahrain Business Climate (2025): Why Structure and Licensing Matter\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting: Bahrain business district office towers.). Bahrain Bay, Diplomatic Area, and Seef District have become hubs not just for finance and fintech, but also for logistics, consultancies, and tech startups—all fueling job growth and rising demand for Commercial Registrations (CRs).\
Surprisingly, in Bahrain, a CR (Commercial Registration) serves as your company’s legal backbone, similar to a UAE trade license or a Saudi SAGIA license, yet it's uniquely modular. You can register a CR with or without a license, affecting everything from what activities you can legally perform to your banking rights, labor visas, and compliance duties.\
For official guides, see Bahrain.com, Gulf News regional updates, and KeyLink’s Bahrain business type overview.\
\
What Is a CR (Commercial Registration) in Bahrain?\
If you’re new to Bahrain, “CR” will quickly become part of your daily vocabulary.\
A Commercial Registration (CR) is the legal registration of any business entity—WLL, SPC, branch, or offshore firm. It’s processed via the Sijilat portal (the MOICT’s digital platform). The CR is like your business’s national ID, used to:\
\
Open bank accounts\
Apply for visas via LMRA\
Register with the tax authority\
Sign contracts and property leases\
\
However, the CR by itself does not always authorize you to start your business activities. For that, licensing comes into play.\
\
CR With a License vs. CR Without a License: The Key Differences\
What Does “With a License” Mean in Bahrain?\
A CR with a license means your business not only exists legally, but is also authorized to carry out commercial activities in line with specific regulations (retail, consultancy, F&B, logistics, etc.). You must secure the relevant activity license(s) before you can operate, invoice, hire staff, or import goods.\
Practical Example:\
A Bahrain Bay-based digital marketing agency set up as a WLL with a licensed CR can:\
\
Launch operations and serve clients instantly\
Open a corporate bank account\
Hire employees via LMRA\
Register for VAT\
\
What Is a “CR Without a License”?\
A CR without a license is like a company shell: your entity exists on record, but cannot trade, invoice, employ, open a bank account, or execute contracts involving regulated activities. Some entrepreneurs use non-licensed CRs to:\
\
Hold a company name or reserve IP while preparing documentation\
Await special approvals (Central Bank, MOICT)\
Set up a holding/subsidiary structure for future expansion\
\
Real-World Example:\
A Seef District fintech startup secured a CR without a license in 2024 to lock down its company name and establish a presence while its Central Bank sandbox approval was pending (I actually did the same once for a regtech venture—more on this below).\
But—and this is crucial—operating without the right license is a fast way to get fines or a permanent ban from business.\
\
The 2025 Regulatory Shift: New “Grace Period” for Licensing\
Bahrain’s MOICT introduced a pivotal policy update in January 2025:\
\
CRs without a license now expire automatically after 60 days unless a valid activity license is attached.\
\
Previously, companies could hold a non-licensed CR for months. The change forces faster compliance, reducing “ghost companies” and improving market trust. The Sijilat system now auto-tracks and notifies every week—so don’t risk missing the deadline.\
Practical Implication:\
- If you’re waiting for external approvals (say, from Tamkeen or EDB), time your CR application accordingly.\
- Many entrepreneurs get caught out, pay extra reactivation fees, or lose their reserved company name entirely. (I dodged this bullet last quarter only because my local fixer in Diplomatic Area flagged the rule on day one!)\
\
Bahrain Company Formation: Step-by-Step With Money- and Time-Saving Tips\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration: Team discussing company formation in Bahrain.)\
- For foreigners: WLLs and SPCs allow 99% foreign ownership with no local sponsor in most sectors (read more here).\
- Free Zone options? Bahrain’s industrial parks and airport zones offer tax advantages and streamlined licensing (details).\
Insider tip:\
MOICT counters in Seef District tend to have much shorter queues at 10am on Wednesdays, compared to the main Diplomatic Area branch—especially outside of Ramadan when business hours shift!\
\
2. Prepare Documents: Avoid the Most Common Delays\
!(\
- Signed articles of association (Apostille required for foreign shareholders)\
- Copy of passport/CPR of all shareholders and directors\
- Proof of address (bank statement or utility bill)\
- No Objection Letter (if a GCC resident on work visa)\
- Activity-specific approvals (Ministry of Health for clinics, EDB for fintech, CBB for finance)\
Document Shortcuts:\
- Scan and upload color PDFs via Sijilat; color scans speed up approval by 1-2 days\
- Use a local notary public near Bahrain Financial Harbour for same-day stamp service\
Don’t forget:\
Majlis-style hospitality goes a long way. Bring traditional coffee to your appointment—officials appreciate the gesture and may even prioritize your file (speaking from repeated experience!).\
\
3. Application Process: When to Apply for the License\
\
Submit CR application via Sijilat\
Specify whether you want the CR with or without a license\
If applying with a license:\
Attach all required supporting docs\
Pay license issuance fees upfront\
If applying without a license:\
You’ll only pay the CR registration fee\
Remember the 60-day grace period introduced in 2025—your CR will expire if no license is added!\
\
Best Practice:\
Submit just before the weekend; the Sijilat system auto-allocates approvals during Fridays, and I find Monday-morning pickups are much faster (avoid last-minute rushes on Thursdays, Bahrain’s business week ends on Friday).\

- Annual audit, tax returns, and renewal (accounting/filing help)\
Challenge faced:\
When I first ran payroll as a new CR holder, I missed the Tamkeen labor fund subsidy deadline—costing us over 1,000 BHD. Now, I recommend working with a local accounting firm from day one.\
\
6. Local Support and Avoiding Common Pitfalls\
\
Alt text: Professional business support: Customer service and business consultation in Bahrain.\
- Delaying license application—risking CR expiry\
- Not planning for Ramadan hour restrictions: government offices close earlier, so get in line before noon\
Recommended resource:\
KeyLink Bahrain is a strong all-in-one advisory I’ve worked with—they know every shortcut.\
A quick tangent:\
Many assume registering with a nominal capital is enough. Actually, some sectors (like consulting or trading) now require minimum paid-up capital be deposited before the license activates—new in 2025. Plan accordingly.\
Saudi Arabia and UAE Comparison:\
Bahrain’s system is far more streamlined, with lower paid-up capital, less bureaucracy, and a single Sijilat portal. In KSA, expect lengthy MISA (formerly SAGIA) approvals; in UAE, free zone residency is the norm, but with higher fees.\
\
Frequently Asked Questions About CR Licensing in Bahrain\
Q1: How quickly can I get a CR with a license in Bahrain?\
If all documents are ready, expect 3-5 business days. Avoid Ramadan or Eid for faster turnaround. Using Sijilat’s VIP line or KeyLink’s concierge service can shave off a day.\
Q2: Can foreign investors own 100% of a Bahrain company?\
Yes, in almost all sectors! Bahrain allows 99% or even 100% foreign ownership outside of restricted activities—far easier than most Gulf neighbors.\
Q3: Can I use a non-licensed CR to open a bank account?\
No. Banks require a valid activity license attached to the CR. Only then will you access corporate accounts and payment gateways.\
Q4: What happens if my CR without a license expires after 60 days (2025 rule)?\
You’ll lose your registration, company name, and may face extra reactivation charges. Always track your status using the Sijilat portal.\
Q5: What’s the main hidden cost that new company owners miss?\
Sector-specific licensing and minimum capital for activation (especially new in 2025 for consultancy and trading). Budget 500-2,000 BHD more, depending on sector. Breakdown here.\
\
Final Word: Which Is Right for You—CR With or Without a License?\
My take, after 15+ Bahrain business setups:\
- If you’re ready to operate, always go for a CR with license. It saves time, unlocks every benefit, and starts your business clock.\
- Need to reserve your spot, await special approvals, or prep your capital? A CR without a license is useful—but stick to the new 60-day rule with military precision.\
The difference isn’t just legal—it shapes your credibility, operations, and even your next majlis invitation. Bahrain rewards those who get their paperwork in order, show respect for local customs, and move fast in this dynamic market.\
If you need expert help with Bahrain company formation, read the full process here or get hands-on support from professionals who know every shortcut.\

1mtt357,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/1mtt357/how_to_know_if_youre_potentially_facing_burnout/,How to know if you're potentially facing burnout? (somewhat of a vent),"I was really scared when I moved out of my parents' house, since I often had what I now believe were burn-outs while in school. I barely graduated with an abysmal GPA, was unable to find a job, managed to go to community college for a year and a half and do relatively alright educationally, but developed an ED and was consuming about 500-600mg of caffeine a day and vaping just to get through. Every day felt like I was expending more of myself than I had to give. My dad said he was actually surprised I've managed to live on my own for two whole years without falling apart and moving back in with him and his wife (albeit with help from my two VERY understanding and helpful roommates who are also my best friends). My father is very kind and wonderful by the way; he just is very blunt and honest, so it definitely is not him being mean or rude at all. In fact I completely agree with him. I've been wildly surprised. I assumed I would come back in a matter of months. 

Instead, I've finally overcome my food issues, quit nicotine, got medicated for my ADHD, have way less caffeine and I managed to get and hold down a job. I work as a receptionist for a busy medical office 4 days a week (~26.5hrs), just enough to pay my portion of rent and bills and get myself a couple coffees a week. I find fulfillment in helping patients and performing my role of helpfulness, swiftness, and pleasantness to the best of my ability, with the social skills I have studied, practiced, and refined for over a decade. I want to go back to college, even just for one day a week, so I can finally get a degree related to my special interest and possibly get a job that would actually energize and deeply fulfill me. 

However... My current job has started doing renovations as of a little under a month ago, which involves loud construction in the building while I am working sometimes. I have my little loop earplugs that get me through but I'm usually shaking and miserable by the end of the day, and I feel embarrassment at how much more dramatically I react to the sudden sounds than my coworkers. It's just getting worse. I've put a LOT of effort into masking since 6th grade, and I'm finding that I keep getting worse and worse at it every day now. Since coming to terms with the fact that I likely have undiagnosed autism (seems I'm the last one I know to have realized this, I'm always the last to know everything, always), it's almost become harder to mask?

I don't know if I'm dooming myself by realizing and noticing how often I'm masking, or if I'm actually putting off/preventing a burn-out by allowing myself the grace of not putting so much effort into it, rather than going full force ""I'm cool and normal and socially adept"" and hyperventilating in the bathroom on my breaks. I'm worried that I still feel like I'm losing my grip on it entirely. I'm scared, really scared, that I'm going to either wear myself out trying too hard and have a total freak-out, or I'm going to lose the ability to mask completely and possibly also lose my job.

Every morning, I’m the one making coffee. But Scout has been running her own café. She’s posted up at the window seat, tongue out, tail wagging, waiting for her usual order: a Barkaccino with extra froth. And she’s far too invested in catching up on the news — which features all the latest chipmunk activities. It’s a silly little scene from our living room, but also a reminder of what “home” feels like: warm, funny, a little chaotic, and better with coffee (and pets).

I’m looking for really good places to work remotely during the week. I don’t really like coffee shops or restaurants since I get overwhelmed with all the people moving and talking. Unless the coffee shops provide good private working spaces/cubicles. 

Ideally something quieter—like a library with good private cubicles or study rooms. Bonus if it’s somewhere I could go with a friend, where they’d have something else to do while I work (so not necessarily just a library).

Any recommendations for solid, quiet work spots with good Wi-Fi that aren’t crowded or distracting?

Doesn’t have to be SLC, but anything within reasonable distance from SLC, if there are better options than SLC.

Like am I not someone special you met too? Why am I not a priority to you? And I'm not saying people 'owe' me priority, but that these people will get very close to me and then drop off once they find other people. It feels like I’m not even seen on the same caliber and it’s happened so many different times that I’m just so destroyed by it. And then seeing one of my friends posting up with their friends, while they're either too busy to even take time to see me (and we haven't seen each other in months) or be there for me when I need support the most (but I'm there for them)—and then these same people tell me they care about me or that they’re lonely, but then they’re conveniently busy and planning coffee dates with people. I just don’t know what to do anymore to change that outcome. I know I'm worth it, but it feels like no one sees it, and it becomes harder to believe.

The worst part is these people tell me they love and care about me, and then treat me like this.

It makes me even more mad because someone I used to be friends with would constantly talk about being alone and lonely, and I'd do my best to be there for them and be a friend, and then they kept flaking on me for their partner and then posting me on their social media as a highlight reel (like bro ;-; be so real rn), and then cancelling plans on me all the time and being upset at me for getting upset (and I'd never tell them they caused me so many mental breakdowns over their actions, I would either say respectfully i was hurt or take space away because they'd get mad at me). And these people know the shit I've been through and still do this. And then they'll flake on our plans and then post other friends online, and then it just feels like a betrayal from multiple friends---because two of my ex friends met and started dating because I introduced them, and then neither of them cared to even maintain a relationship with me after. Like guys, stop being so damn dehumanzing. We are people. Stop treating us like commodities and background characters. I have feelings too. I matter too.

And then they still have the audacity to say they're lonely when they're the reason they are ;-; but then people like me who are actively trying so hard to be a good friend and make connections are underlooked and taken for granted all the damn time. What's even worse is that some of these people are literally surrounded by really unhealthy and damaging people (not all their friends ofc), but then those are the people they prioritize and go through hell and back for vs our friendship ;-; and I mean some of these relationships were BAD. Like NOT okay! I really hope they're not with those same people because oh my goodness, or that they find out soon for themselves. But it just boggles my mind !! Like bro !! 

  
And then I'm told by outsiders, ""wow, those people are dream friends I'd always wish I had,"" like bro--what about me? and sure, but are they even friends if they never even show up for the relationships unless they're going through shit or feeling particularly lonely? Like-- bro!!

I’ve spent the last few months hopping between services, trying every **iptv free trial reddit 2025** could throw at me, and making notes like a very unqualified scientist. Here’s my honest ranking—no hype, just what actually happened on my screens.

# 1. [**IPTVMEEZZY**](https://iptvmeezzy.com/)

* **Price:** $16/month (cheaper on longer iptv subscription)
* **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD
* **Smoothness:** 9/10 (the occasional hiccup, but even my morning news streams survived)
* **My notes:** Ended up here after a friend mentioned their **iptv reseller** deal. Setup was painless, and the channel list is almost intimidating—there’s stuff for everyone, from Premier League to old cartoons. Only once or twice did I need to refresh for a laggy stream. So far, the least amount of troubleshooting on my end.

# 2. [**RocketStream**](https://rocketstream.com/)

* **Price:** $15/month
* **Channels:** 37,000 live, 120,000 VOD
* **Smoothness:** 8/10 (smooth on most days, but lagged during big sports events)
* **My notes:** RocketStream’s interface is friendly, and their support actually got back to me within a day. VOD is decent, though I had to dig for some newer releases. I liked that they offer an **iptv free trial**—it saved me from an instant commitment.

# 3. [**FlowCast TV**](https://medium.com/p/7153a0b718b8)

* **Price:** $14/month
* **Channels:** 32,000 live, 105,000 VOD
* **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (good for movies, but live news sometimes froze)
* **My notes:** I tried FlowCast after seeing a random thread about their **iptv reseller** deals. Their subscription plans are flexible, which helps if you’re indecisive like me. The main downside was a few channels going offline at weird hours.

# 4. NeonPlay IPTV

* **Price:** $13/month
* **Channels:** 27,000 live, 82,000 VOD
* **Smoothness:** 7/10 (some buffering, mainly on international channels)
* **My notes:** NeonPlay is straightforward—nothing flashy, but I liked their guide layout. I lost my favorite cooking channel for a weekend, but streams bounced back after a reset. Not my main, but solid as a backup.

# 5. [**CloudNova Live**](https://iptvmeezzy.blogspot.com/2025/08/premier-league-2025-your-ultimate-iptv.html)

* **Price:** $12/month
* **Channels:** 20,000 live, 54,000 VOD
* **Smoothness:** 6.5/10 (buffered a lot during primetime, VOD was OK for older shows)
* **My notes:** CloudNova is definitely entry-level. It’s fine if you just need background TV, but I wouldn’t count on it for big live events. Their **iptv subscription** page is easy to use, but I found myself channel-hopping a lot just to find a smooth stream.

# [**My IPTV**](https://iptvmeezzy.com/) Thoughts in 2025

After all these trials, a few things became clear:

* **Free trials are your friend**—always test before you commit.
* Even the [**best iptv providers**](https://iptvmeezzy.com/) will have the occasional hiccup, so don’t stress over a rare glitch.
* Don’t get distracted by huge channel numbers—focus on what you actually watch.
* If you’re curious about the **iptv reseller** world, start small—managing support is no joke!
* Finally, always use a VPN. Better safe than sorry.",0,1755538938.0,RimworldArt,0,0.5,False
1mtsyb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Martinsville_VA/comments/1mtsyb6/indie_film_on_political_family_rifts_wraps/,Indie film on political family rifts wraps shooting in Henry County,"Per Henry County Enterprise

Production is now wrapping up on a movie filmed in Henry County. “YOYOS” (You’re On Your Own), focuses on political divisions within families. The project raised $50,130 through crowdfunding.

The masterminds behind the film, Lexi Graboski and Michal Sinnott, worked to bring the vision to life. The drama-comedy follows liberal sisters Dinah and Abigail, who return to their childhood home in rural Virginia after a long estrangement to pay respects to their supposedly dying conservative father—only to be roped into running the survivalist camp for kids that their parents founded after the sisters left.

Inspired by films such as “Little Miss Sunshine”, “Troop Beverly Hills”, “Captain Fantastic”, and “Moonrise Kingdom”, the story aims to show the value of family despite opposing viewpoints.

“In fact, what we’re trying to do is show that we’re stronger together,” said Sinnott, who plays one of the sisters alongside Graboski. Sinnott previously directed “Unpacking”, which won multiple awards.

“This is my second time making an indie film. I shot my first film in Bali, in Indonesia, and it’s called “Unpacking”, and you can see it on Amazon,” she said. “That was a much smaller production, but the end result was really great. We were in 25 festivals and won 17 awards. We screened at the Richmond International Film Festival.”

“While YOYOS is a fictional story, it is inspired by my own relationship with my parents,” Graboski said. “I love my parents deeply, and we have luckily managed to remain close despite some ugly arguments. I still believe that we share a lot of the same values: family, kindness, love, community, and service. So how could our thoughts on how to protect those things differ so much?”

The decision to film in Henry County came after Sinnott moved to the area in 2023. “We moved here and we made Martinsville/Henry County our home. And we’ll continue to make films. It’s exciting to be opening this up to the community and also see the community response,” Sinnott said, promising more movies in the future.

The film also boasts an impressive director. “After interviewing 11 great candidates, we chose Lynda J. Reiss, who we knew we were destined to work with. Lynda has worked in the industry for over 30 years as a property master and art director on projects including “Stranger Things”, “True Detective”, and “American Beauty”,” Graboski wrote on the crowdfunding page Seed&Spark.

Many cast members are Virginia locals. “We kind of actually do a worldwide search, but we have a number of actors from Virginia,” Graboski said. Several hail from the Richmond area. “Four of the seven kids are Virginians… they’ve all become best friends—it’s like getting that “Goonies” or “Sandlot” vibe,” Sinnott said.

The pair plan to send the film to festivals and hope for a local premiere. For now, they are focusing on wrapping production and moving into post-production.

“It’s a miracle to get any film made,” Sinnott said. “Even telling friends that I’m making it—they’re all like, oh, I would like to get coffee with you and see how you pulled that off.”",2,1755538920.0,Martinsville_VA,0,1.0,False

I bought a 2-pack (Bow, Coffee) from Marshalls for $6.99. You can also find them online for $12 for the 2-pack (Bow, Coffee) and $18 for the 4-pack (Bow, Coffee, French Toast, and Raspberry Jam).

*PS- I do these posts for fun/science, but if you end up liking the product, then more power to you <3 Tiktoker Michelle Nguyen (michellenewyen) similarly posts reviews of knockoff/dupe products including some rhode if you want to go check those out too.*

**Overall impression** \-- this dupe of the rhode lip tints is quite similar in quality to the Miss A (AOA) lip glazes ([review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rhodeskin/comments/1k38t31/miss_a_aoa_lip_tint_dupe_review/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)), but R&M does NOT have any scent and also DO contain peptides, while the AOA lip glazes do not. The fact that these do not have any scent is a huge plus for me, because I have sensory issues and did not particularly like the artificial scents of the AOA lip glazes. The shade matches look pretty close to the authentic rhode lip tints, so if you need a cheaper backup, and/or looking for a basic lip balm that will fit perfectly in the rhode lip case, this would fit the bill.

**Major similarities and differences:**  
\- **packaging:** The dimensions are identical. The plastic used for the packaging is slightly lower quality than authentic rhode. The applicator tip is a little lower quality visually than rhode applicator tip, but I can't tell a difference when using it. No plastic snags in the tip and it works well.  
\- **formula:** The formula is quite similar in feeling to the AOA lip glazes. Super cushiony on the lips, no graininess, no stickiness.  
\- **scent:** NO scent. It states on the ingredients label that there is fragrance, but I couldn't detect any.  
\- **shade match:** I don't have the authentic rhode lip tints in ""Ribbon"" and ""Espresso"" to compare, but they appear quite close based on my swatches and the authentic rhode swatches.

\- We have the premium drinks package, but I know this doesn't cover things from the chocolate shop. Where would be a good place to get a nice (included) coffee in the mornings?

1mtstsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugAndProof/comments/1mtstsb/explore_the_best_espresso_maker_for_home_coffee/,Explore the best espresso maker for home coffee lovers Imusa,"Coffee has always been a critical part of my morning routine, but finding the perfect espresso maker has been a bit of an adventure. My search led me to the Imusa 6 or 3cup Electric Espresso Maker. Right away, its sleek black design caught my eye, fitting effortlessly into the modern aesthetic of my kitchen. The combination of functionality and a minimalist look was promising, but I was curious to see how well it would elevate my coffee experience. Testing it daily over the past few weeks has been a bitter-sweet journey of discovery, with plenty to love and a few quirks I had to work around.

**DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY**  
The first thing I noticed was the espresso maker’s sturdy and stylish build. Crafted with a cast aluminum base and a tinted brown carafe, it feels substantial without being bulky. This combination of materials screams durability. The black exterior adds a touch of elegance, and it pairs beautifully with just about any kitchen decor. The detachable base with its simple on/off switch is a convenient touch, and the cool-touch handle makes handling it a breeze, even when the espresso is piping hot. On closer inspection, though, minor details like the carafe lid’s hinge felt a bit flimsy. I wasn’t sure how well it’d hold up in the long run—time will tell.

**EFFICIENCY AND USER-FRIENDLINESS**  
Using the espresso maker daily made me appreciate its user-friendly design. Brewing espresso couldn’t be simpler—flip the switch, and the brewing begins. The visual brewing indicator is a small yet significant feature that takes the guesswork out of the process. For someone like me who often multitasks in the kitchen, this was a game-changer. However, the detachable base can be tricky; occasionally, I found aligning the carafe properly a bit of a hassle. I wouldn’t say this is a deal-breaker, but it’s something that requires a little patience. 

[Ready for Imusa 6 or 3cup Electric Espresso Maker? Amazon has your price.](https://applegreenshop.com/p/b0btr46tjm/)

**VERSATILE BREWING OPTIONS**  
One standout feature of this espresso maker is its versatility. With the ability to brew either 6 or 3 espresso cups, it’s perfect for catering to varying needs. On weekdays, I go for the 3-cup option when it’s just me. Weekends, however, call for the 6-cup setting when entertaining friends who are just as coffee-obsessed as I am. Its ability to brew traditional espresso, Cuban coffee, Italian coffee, and even the classic Moka deliver an impressive range. The customizable capacity is great, but I did notice the flavor slightly differed when brewing smaller portions—something espresso purists might pick up on.

**POSITIVE FEATURES**  
From my experience, the espresso maker brings a lot to the table:  
- A sleek, durable design that complements modern kitchens.  
- Simplified brewing with a detachable base and brewing indicator.  
- Adjustable capacity for both solo use and small gatherings.  
- Versatility to brew multiple espresso styles, offering robust flavor profiles.  

**LIMITATIONS**  
That being said, not everything was flawless:  
- Flimsy components, like the carafe hinge, could impact long-term durability.  
- Aligning the base takes more effort than preferred.  
- The flavor can vary slightly with smaller cup settings.

**DIRECT COMPETITORS**  
While testing, I did compare it to some popular products in the same category. The Bialetti Moka Express, for instance, shines in terms of traditional brewing charm but lacks the electric functionality that makes the Imusa espresso maker so effortless. Meanwhile, products like the De'Longhi Dedica Espresso Machine offer a more sophisticated brewing process but come at a much steeper price. The Imusa maker stands out as a middle-ground option—affordable, efficient, and thoughtfully designed but not as premium as higher-end rivals. It’s a practical choice for everyday users who prioritize simplicity without compromising too much on quality.

**BUDGET-FRIENDLY**  
When weighing its cost against its features, this espresso maker really pulls its weight. It isn't a hefty investment, especially for what it delivers—versatility, ease of use, and a stylish finish. Yes, competitors might excel in certain aspects, like more advanced brewing technology or build materials, but they also demand a higher budget. Overall, it feels like solid value, especially for someone getting into espresso-making or looking for a device to simplify their coffee-crafting routine.

The Rise of Entitled Coffee Drinkers in the Philippines,"Filipino coffee culture has grown so much that it’s no longer just about caffeine it’s about image. In every cafe, you’ll spot the “entitled” crowd: the ones who order their ₱250 frappuccino like they’re dictating a UN resolution, then complain if the barista didn’t swirl the whipped cream at a perfect angle. These people don’t even crave coffee; they crave validation. The cafe isn’t their pit stop, it’s their stage.

The irony? A lot of them act like they’re connoisseurs, yet the closest they’ve gotten to real coffee appreciation is reading the seasonal Starbucks menu. They’ll roll their eyes at a ₱20 kape sa kanto, but rave about a “limited edition” latte that tastes like melted candy. Coffee, for them, isn’t about taste it’s about flexing that cup with the logo, posting it on IG, and pretending their seat by the cafe window is a prime real estate.

Here’s the truth: being a regular at Starbucks or any cafe in particular doesn’t make you special, and snapping at baristas won’t make your latte taste better.

1mtsn81,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeGiftcardsnet/comments/1mtsn81/keurig_codes/,Keurig Codes,"Check the Full Details Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/keurig-codes/

Keurig codes are essential for coffee enthusiasts who want to enhance their brewing experience. Understanding these unique codes can help users unlock special features and maintain their machines effectively. Each Keurig coffee machine model utilizes specific codes that can indicate water filter changes, maintenance requirements, and compatibility with coffee pod varieties.

The codes are typically displayed on the machine's digital screen, guiding users through various functions. For instance, if your machine suggests it's time to change the water filter, it will show a specific code. Becoming familiar with these codes allows users to ensure their machines operate at optimal performance and flavor extraction.

Another vital aspect of Keurig codes is their relationship with coffee pod compatibility. Certain codes may appear when an incompatible pod is detected, preventing users from brewing. Ignoring these messages can lead to machine malfunctions or sub-par coffee quality. Thus, knowing how to interpret the codes is essential for a seamless brewing experience.

I’m a 27 year old dude, who’s been single for a few months. 

Looking to expand my social circle, so I’ve been attending groups in my area on the MeetUp app, (specifically the Group is for 20-30 year olds in my City) and it’s been really fun! 

Well… I’m going to a new event tonight, and the host is CUTE, definitely my type. 

Last week, I had a question about the event for tonight, so I messaged her on the app. We made small talk for a bit, and she even commented that she loved my profile picture, (a selfie of me doing one of my hobbies,) and that we were excited to meet each other at tonight’s event.

Well the event is tonight from 7-9pm, planning on just being social/friendly with everyone, making new friends, asking for phone numbers to connect, especially hers. 

After I get her number tonight, in about 2 days, I plan on texting her. 

Is this too much/too weird? 

“Hey (Her Name), I had a lot of fun at the Meetup the other day! It was great meeting you, hanging out with everyone. 

 If I’m being honest, I’d love to get to know you better.

Would you like to grab lunch/coffee, after my cruise? :) “

For clarity’s sake, I’m going on a family cruise/vacation from August 22nd-September 6th, and I plan on working that into general conversation with three group. 

“Anybody have any cool vacations coming up? Etc.” 

Does the above text, seem A) appropriate, B) Clear enough that she knows I’m asking her out on a DATE?

Okay, WHAT? I literally cannot believe this happened to me, and I still don't know if it was pure luck, some secret hack, or just the craziest day in my phone's boring app-life. But YES, fam, I DID make $100 completely legit, just by testing apps on my phone – in ONE SINGLE DAY.

I KNOW. I'm as shocked as you probably are right now.

A few days ago, I was doom-scrolling (as one does at 2AM 😬), and I came across a link – 👉 **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** 👈 – and thought, whatever, my sleep schedule's already destroyed, so why not see what this is about?

Here’s where it gets wild:

- The sign-up literally took me less than 2 minutes (NO, they didn’t ask for weird crypto wallets or my blood type).
- I got access to a whole LIST of apps needing testers. Like, dozens.  
- All on my phone. Didn’t even touch my laptop.  
- Simple instructions: Download an app, use it, rate the experience, DONE.

I just kept thinking – this has to be a scam, right? BUT:

- Every test showed what they would pay up front ($5, $8, some $12 per app!).
- Some were games, some were shopping, and one weird one was like meditation for cats (???).
- Most of them only wanted 10-15 minutes per app.

By the time my panic-coffee kicked in, I’d already completed like 4, and my ""pending payout"" was racking up SO FAST.

I checked **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** again and again to make sure I wasn’t seeing things.

Even after I hit the first $20 payout mark (!!!), it kept going!

This is the part that totally surprised me:

- They paid out through PayPal. No hoops, no ""earn $500 more to unlock your money"" nonsense.  
- Got a notification half an hour later: $100 credited.  
- I literally YELLED and woke up my dog.

Here’s what’s even more unreal:  
**https://goodnovel.org/testapp** still has new app tests every day. (I honestly have no idea how long this gold rush lasts...)

If you’re scrolling and doubting or you’ve seen those “How I made $10,000 by sipping coffee from my sofa” posts before – SAME. I totally get it.

But this was honestly just easy money. Super fun, not stressful.

I know, it SOUNDs like it shouldn’t be real, but hey – I got the $100. All just for giving my opinions, no expertise needed.

Skeptical? I was, too. Try it, scroll through the app list on  **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** , pick what interests you, and see how fast it adds up.

If anybody’s already tried **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** – PLEASE TELL ME – did you get weird apps too, or am I now the Top Critic in Cat Meditation?? 😂🛋️

Has anyone else tried making money by testing apps before, or am I living in a simulation? Either way, 10/10 would recommend!

1mtslon,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1mtslon/cmv_progressives_and_socialists_who_arent_vegan/,CMV: Progressives and Socialists Who Aren’t Vegan Are Massive Hypocrites And Should Go Vegan For Moral Consistency,"- Progressives (sometimes called “Liberals”, which is a definitional issue, as Classical Liberals can also be Conservatives) argue against traditions, norms and appeal to tradition fallacies (and generally, rightly so); just because something’s always been X way, doesn’t mean it always should be. Conservatives argue in the direction of appeal to tradition (but of course, whether something is or isn’t a norm/tradition doesn’t determine whether it’s right or wrong). A common argument non-vegans use is the appeal to tradition fallacy. For Progressives to be consistent, they should argue and act against this.



- Progressives argue against innocent beings suffering needlessly.



- Progressives generally err more towards Ecological Activism. Agriculture, specifically, animal agriculture is now thought to be the worst contributor to emissions: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f2/pdf At the least, equivalent to transportation: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17524032.2020.1805344#abstract 



“Results from our review suggest that the vegan diet is the optimal diet for the environment because, out of all the compared diets, its production results in the lowest level of GHG emissions.” https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/15/4110/htm



Further research backing this up:  
https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523048992




Whilst most Progressives also identify as Socialists and vice versa, this isn’t always the case, so: 



- The roots of Socialism can essentially be boiled down to challenging the powerful (bourgeoisie) and sticking up for the most disempowered (proletariat). Animal livestock are the most disempowered beings on the planet. To be consistent, self-proclaimed Socialists should be vegan.



- If one doesn’t consider animals in this, then the economics of being able to feed/benefit more poor people should be considered a factor: 
“We find that, given the current mix of crop uses, growing food exclusively for direct human consumption could, in principle, increase available food calories by as much as 70%, which could feed an additional 4 billion people.”
https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/034015



One argument I have heard from Progressives/Socialists is that they can’t afford to be vegan. That vegan protein is too expensive. This is not true.



Tesco organic chicken at: £19.50/kg. It has 23.8g of protein per 100g. https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/250536058



Organic wheat protein powder I use to make seitan at: £9.89/kg. It has 78g of protein per 100g. https://www.buywholefoodsonline.co.uk/organic-gluten.html



Organic soy mince at £8.51/kg. It has 44.6 per 100g. 
https://www.buywholefoodsonline.co.uk/organic-textured-vegetable-protein-plain-mince-tvp.html

Organic hemp seed at £14.87. It has 32.3 per 100g. 
https://www.buywholefoodsonline.co.uk/organic-shelled-hemp-seeds.html


There’re other vegan protein sources for those who have Coeliac disorder or are allergic to Soy. 




You can get every single essential nutrient and even many non-essential nutrients from plant-based sources. And vegan diets are at least as healthy as, if not healthier than omnivore diets. 


GENERAL HEALTH AND LONGEVITY:
2009:
The low-methionine content of vegan diets may make methionine restriction feasible as a life extension strategy
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18789600/


2019:
In humans, certain healthy foods are associated with longer telomere length, and reductions in protein intake with lower IGF-1 levels, respectively, both relations being associated with longer lifespan. Furthermore, a high intake of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and also coffee is associated with a reduced risk for all-cause mortality whereas a high intake of (red) meat and especially processed meat is positively related to all-cause mortality.
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31631676/


2020:
There is substantial evidence that plant-based diets are associated with better health but not necessarily lower mortality rates. The exact mechanisms of health promotion by vegan diets are still not entirely clear but most likely multifactorial. Reasons for and quality of the vegan diet should be assessed in longevity studies.
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31895244/


2022:
The largest gains would be made by eating more legumes, whole grains and nuts, and less red and processed meat.
https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003889


Whilst I think everyone should be vegan (with reasonable exceptions for the very rare people out there with genuine severe food allergies to multiple vegan protein staples; e.g. if you’re allergic to gluten, soy, peanuts, hemp, etc.), Conservatives and Capitalists are less morally inconsistent in not being vegan (that’s not saying I agree with it, but hypocrisy is such a universal insult for a reason).",0,1755538163.0,changemyview,47,0.18,False
1mtslf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIpoweredInfluencer/comments/1mtslf5/stop_everything_i_just_got_paid_real_cash_for/,Stop Everything: I Just Got PAID Real Cash for Clicking CAPTCHAS?! Am I Dreaming or Is This the Easiest Side Hustle of 2024?!,"Okay — am I literally losing my mind or did I just get offered CASH (not points, not coupons, not phone wallpapers) for clicking CAPTCHAS? And not just once!! Multiple apps ~ALL~ over my feed are sliding in, saying ""Test this app, click this button, CLEAR these funky CAPTCHAS, and get paid, fam.""  

Is this real life? Or is this just fantasy?  
But wait. Let’s break it down:  

- **""Get Paid to Test Apps.""** ✔️ Sounds pretty normal.
- **""All you do is prove you’re not a robot.""** Umm?
- **""It’s just CAPTCHAS.""** IS THAT EVEN A JOB?

I had to **double-triple-quadruple check** if this was just another too-good-to-be-true scam. So I dove down the rabbit hole—searches, reviews, actual testing. NO SLEEP. INFINITE TABS.  

Guys. Turns out,
**App Testing Gateways** DO exist, and shockingly? YES, they’ll pay you for literally completing boring, repetitive—and sometimes downright psychedelic—CAPTCHAS for new apps! The logic:  
- Apps need *real* humans for legit QA before they go public.
- They want to make sure the CAPTCHAs actually keep bots out.
- YOU’RE the guinea pig.

But should YOU jump in? Here’s what NOBODY is telling you:

- **Payout Minimums = The Ultimate Patience Test**  
Some of these places want you to rack up like $30 before a payout. I’m not THAT patient. Who is?  
Check first, or you’ll just be clicking for fun.

- **Payment Proofs = Ask, Ask, Ask!**  
Screenshots or it didn’t happen.  
Scroll that r/beermoney and r/workonline for REAL user testimonials before handing over that precious time.

- **Personal Data = Gollum Level Precious**  
You just need to sign up, but don’t give out your socials, email passwords, your childhood pet’s favorite snack, or WHATEVER the app asks.  
Stay safe!

Now if you’re hitting up **bold, blaring ""CLICK HERE TO START TESTING"" buttons**—use your big Internet brain.  
One site I found *actually* paid via PayPal and Gift Cards (tried and true):  
**[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

Here’s what SHOCKED me:  
- I dropped 8 mins on their CAPTCHAs. Rewarded with a coffee’s worth (kinda wild).  
- They didn’t harvest my contacts or ask for three sources of ID.  
- Next day payout.  
Legit surprised!

If you wanna swim through these click-oceans, remember:
- Start small.
- Use a dummy email.
- Screenshot your progress.
- SHARE your results here!

Triply make sure the link was the real one so not to end up pranked — it's **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**  
Bookmark it, or you’ll find that there’s a sea of lookalikes out there and none seem as easy.  
And don't forget, this is the direct application test hub: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

TL;DR: Yes, you can get paid to smash CAPTCHAS, but it’s not a dream job (unless your dream is to prove you’re not a robot 6,000 times a day). But with the right platforms (like **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**), you might fill your latte fund.

Made $100 in 7 Days by Tapping Apps on My Couch—Is This Real Life or a Glitch?! 💸🤯,"Okay, wait—can somebody tell me if the universe glitched for a second? 

Because I just made **$100 in a WEEK**. On my phone. Literally, by clicking through random apps while chilling on my couch.

I mean, has the simulation always been this easy, or am I missing something?! 💸💸

So, here’s what happened:

- Stumbled across this random link (**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**) while doom-scrolling after work.
- Figured it’d be another sketchy survey dump, but curiosity (& boredom) got the best of me.  
- A few taps later, I was reviewing apps that wanted honest feedback—NOT one of those “watch 300000 videos for 2 cents” traps.

Fast forward: In seven days, BOOM. $100 legit in my PayPal. No cryptic requirements. No “tell us your deepest secret for payout.” Nada.

✔️ **Do you want the crazy part?** THEY PAID FOR STUFF LIKE:

  - Checking an app’s onboarding process.
  - Spotting UI bugs (even if you don’t know what that means, just say “the font is weird,” LOL.)
  - Testing notifications.
  - Leaving an honest review (yes, even “too many ads” counts.)

I’m not kidding—the apps themselves are addicting, low-key ridiculous, and sometimes oddly therapeutic. 

Every morning I’d check **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (bookmark this, for real) and there’d be a couple new apps to test. Try it while grabbing your coffee, half-awake.  

Half the time, I was baffled, wondering who is paying for this and why, but also—
Should I feel guilty for getting paid to click “allow notifications?” 🤷

Let me break it down:

- No prior experience (unless bingeing Candy Crush counts).
- No need to hand over your taxes or a passport or…your cat.
- Honestly, barely took 30 mins a day: breakfast, bus, whatever.

And that’s it. By Friday, notification went off from PayPal. $100. Literal disbelief. THANK YOU, tech gods? Lucky algorithm? WHO KNOWS. 

Of course, skeptics, here’s the perpetual question—what’s the catch?  
For now, I’ve found nothing. If the cosmic balance tips, I’ll report back.

But if you want to give it a shot, here’s the magic link (again, no shame, I want you to feel this rush): **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**

And if you want to keep hitting refresh for more, don’t forget:
> Save **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** somewhere visible. 

Sorry if I sound hype—I just don’t understand how I scrolled past money for months. Am I the last one who didn’t know app testing is a semi-legit “side quest?”

Anyone else tried this? Confused? Excited? Illuminated?  
Drop your stories, warnings, or if you cracked the code behind this!

The Airbnb was tucked into the woods, far from the nearest town. No Wi-Fi, patchy cell service, just me, a cabin, and the damp smell of pine and rain. Perfect. I needed to vanish for a few days, to stop replaying our fights, the things I shouldn’t have said, the things I should have left unsaid.

Driving there, the rain-slicked roads made the world blur. Headlights reflected off the wet asphalt like tiny mirrors, fragments of my own reflection bouncing back at me. I hummed to keep myself awake, but my thoughts kept straying to him. To the last text I never replied to. To his laugh that felt like home and betrayal at once.

When I arrived, the cabin looked exactly like the photos—cozy, wooden, modest, with a small porch overlooking the river. Mist rolled off the water like a slow, persistent exhale. I pulled my bag from the trunk and hesitated on the steps. Silence stretched in every direction. I could feel it pressing against my ears, waiting.

Inside, it was warm, smelled faintly of wood polish, and smelled faintly like someone had lived here recently. I shrugged it off and unpacked. Lights, bedspread, kitchenware—all in order. I made myself a cup of coffee and sank into the corner of the couch, wrapped in a blanket. I wasn’t even halfway through the first sip when my phone buzzed.

Unknown: “Finally.”

My stomach dropped. I didn’t recognize the number. I dropped the phone, expecting it to be a mistake.

Unknown: “You’re here. I can see you.”

I froze. Checked every window. Nothing. The rain blurred the forest beyond. My heart began hammering. Maybe it was a prank. Maybe someone had hacked the Airbnb. Maybe I was losing it.

Hours passed. I unpacked, rearranged, tried to paint. Every time I moved, the phone buzzed again. Each message seemed impossibly precise:

Unknown: “The mug. You like it for the way it curves. You always use it first thing in the morning.”

I hadn’t told anyone about the mug. I hadn’t even packed it until a week ago. My hands shook as I set it down.

Unknown: “The blanket. Folded wrong. I fixed it.”

I ran to check. The corner was tucked neatly, the folds perfect. I didn’t do that.

The storm outside rattled the cabin walls. I paced. Every creak sounded like footsteps. Every rustle of leaves against the windows became a whisper. I tried calling my best friend, but no signal. Tried 911. Nothing.

At some point, I realized I hadn’t taken off my shoes. I set them down. When I returned five minutes later, they were angled differently, toes pointing toward the center of the room.

I tried reasoning. Maybe it was just a glitch. Maybe someone had remote access to the cabin’s smart lock, its lights, its tiny wifi-connected thermostat. Maybe… maybe I had imagined the whole weekend to begin with.

Then my phone buzzed again.

Unknown: “Why are you pretending this isn’t your idea?”

I stopped breathing. The words hung in the air, heavy, impossible. My own thoughts twisted into unfamiliar shapes. Did I subconsciously invite him here? Did I want this?

I fled to the bedroom, pulled the blanket over my head, shaking. Hours passed in silence punctuated only by the occasional buzz of my phone. Each message knew more than I thought I had told anyone.

Around 3 a.m., the final storm subsided. Mist hung low over the river. I peeked out the window. The forest was empty, serene. I told myself I was safe.

Then I noticed it: shadows moving just beyond the trees. Not humans, exactly—too tall, too still. Every time I blinked, they seemed closer. Gone when I looked again.

My phone buzzed one last time.

Unknown: “Welcome home.”

I haven’t returned since. I deleted the Airbnb account, blocked the number, tried to forget.

But sometimes, late at night, when everything is quiet and I’m alone, my phone buzzes. Just once.

Unknown: “Miss me?”

And I swear, even with the light on, I feel the faintest shift in the room—like the air itself is watching.

Last week, I was heading to my office where I’m doing an internship, but when I arrived, I found out they hadn’t told me they were on holiday (which was pretty frustrating, honestly). After taking the train all the way there without even having breakfast, I decided to stop by a coffee shop nearby.

I stayed there for a while, and then this guy walked in. At first, I just thought he was cute, but then he came over and asked if it was okay to open the ATM machine in front of me. We chatted a bit — he told me he was a software engineer, here for about a month to work on the machines (he was a foreigner). After just a couple of minutes of talking, I realized I ***really*** liked this guy.

I wanted to keep talking to him, but I didn’t want to bother him while he was working. So after a few minutes, I just left without saying anything else. Now I feel horrible because I really wish I had asked for his number… or at least his name.

I even went back the next day hoping to see him again, but he was gone. To make it worse, I ran into my colleague — the one who was supposed to tell me they were on holiday in the first place and he completely ignored me.

I regret it so much. I feel stupid for not having the courage back then, because I’ll probably never see him again.

Around february of this year, I quit my job overseas and came back to my small home town. Surprisingly, every single person in my close friend group happened to be here, and they were all excited that i was coming back.

In the very first week of our hangouts, i’ve realized that something has shifted in the group majorly. Before i left the country, we would mainly go to coffee shops, try new items in the menu, maybe have a walk or just hangout in a local park and have very deep conversations. But now, all they ever want to do is to drink. And they prefer going out after 9pm.

For a while, they’ve tried to meet maybe a little earlier, 8pm instead of one because i had logistics issues (im the only one living a little far away and none of us have a car lol). I was getting a little critical about their drinking habits, saying we should do different things sometimes. It’s not fun to spend 5 nights a week in a stupid small town bar. And i got a heavy backlash about me just robbing my nose into their business.

Then i got a job. Started working between 8-6 and i had do wake up at 7 am and that would mean that i was not going to be able to join their late night hangouts during weekdays. Again, they tried to accommodate me maybe for a while i felt very good about that up until the point where one of them that i was texting to thought i was getting passive aggressive about my situation. Which, to be fair, i do get passive aggresive at times but it was not the case in thar specific moment. After that, everything shifts. They went from “we thought that you wouldn’t be able to come” to ignoring my texts, my calls or straight up getting mad at me when i tried to confront them about how i felt.

I even cried saying, I live alone in this city and I’m not dead, im just working and working people actually need support too. They completely ignored those texts and carried their conversations to many different group chats that I’m not a part of. 

It’s been more than a month since i saw or talked to any of them after them bluntly ignoring my texts in the group chat.

I feel lonely, completely discarded, and the fact that none of them seems to care that I’m slowly fading away just pisses me off too much.",4,1755537644.0,socialskills,2,1.0,False

Hey, fellow AiContentAutomators! 🙌

Have you ever dreamt of making money without ever showing your face? Like, imagine waking up, rolling over to your laptop, and BAM—cash flow coming in while you sip your coffee. Sounds dreamy, right? Well, it turns out that dream isn’t as far-fetched as we thought! 

**Faceless growth is a thing, and it’s taking the online world by storm!** 🌊 No more vlogs, no more makeup for the camera, just pure content and lucrative results. So, how do you get started? *Let’s break it down!*

### Here’s the deal:

- **Hide behind the screen**: You don’t need to be a social media star to thrive. Think blogs, podcasts, or TikTok animations. Ever thought of creating just an audio podcast? Or maybe animated videos? Who needs to be on camera, right? 

- **Leverage AI**: Use tools (yes, I’m talking about our buddies in AI) to help write, edit, and create. Not only does this save time but it also enhances creativity. If you haven’t checked out this great resource yet, you definitely need to see how to leverage AI for AI Content Automation! 👉 [Whop’s Guide Here](https://whop.com/howtoai/?a=liveitupdeals)

- **Focus on niche content**: Find that golden niche. Whether it’s reviewing the latest gadgets, sharing cooking tips, or diving deep into conspiracy theories, the secret sauce is being an expert in what you love. 

- **Monetize smartly**: Affiliate marketing, sponsorships, or selling your guides—there are endless ways to cash in. What’s cooler than earning money while doing what you love in a faceless manner?

### Personal Story Time! 🤔 

A couple of months ago, a friend of mine was stuck in the endless loop of making TikTok videos, always freaking out about her hair and makeup. One night over coffee (okay, maybe a few too many cups), I told her, “Why don’t you just voiceover your content instead?” Fast forward to today, she’s raking in the views and cash with her faceless, yet engaging, tutorials while being cozy and comfy at home. 

Let’s be real: Who wants to deal with the stress of finding the perfect lighting or the “just woke up” look? 😅

**So, are you ready to start your faceless journey?** Think about how liberating it would feel to grow your presence without the pressures of being in front of the camera. 

Let’s chat! What are your thoughts on this faceless growth trend? Have any of you tried it already? What content ideas are bubbling in your brain? Let’s brainstorm together! 🚀",1,1755537641.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

The first time she met him, he was leaning against the jukebox in the corner of the bar, grinning like he owned the night. She was twenty-three, her hair smelling of drugstore shampoo and hope. He bought her a whiskey and told her she had a laugh like sunlight.

Back then, she believed love was a cure-all.
Back then, she believed him.

They became a story.
Late-night drives with the windows down, his hand warm on her thigh. Singing badly to old songs, stealing kisses in empty parking lots. He told her forever wasn’t long enough, and she tucked the words under her skin like a charm.

She didn’t notice the first red flag.
Or the second.

The first time he vanished for a weekend, he came back with roses and a smile so practiced it made her forget she’d been crying over burnt toast and unanswered calls.
The second time, he blamed work. She nodded. Because love—real love—was built on trust.

What she didn’t know was that trust is the rope they give you before the drop.


Eleven years later, the woman in the mirror was unrecognizable.
Two kids. Mortgage. Hair tied up in a messy knot because she was too tired to do more. The man she once couldn’t stop touching now barely brushed past her in the hallway.

She tried to win him back. Bought new dresses, dyed her hair chestnut brown, painted her lips red. But the gap between them wasn’t closing—it was widening, and in the middle of it was the silence. Heavy. Suffocating.


The truth came in whispers.
A receipt for two glasses of wine at a restaurant she’d never been to.
A name she didn’t know flashing across his phone.
Perfume clinging to his shirt—sweet, expensive, and nothing like her body spray.

She found the earring one afternoon wedged between the passenger seat and the console. A single teardrop pearl. Small, but heavier than a stone.

That night, she stood in the kitchen holding it in her palm.
His phone screen lit up, and for once, he looked at her instead of it. “You’re overthinking.”

Her voice was thin, like paper about to tear. “I’m not stupid. Just… tell me why.”

He set the phone down, leaning on the counter like they were discussing bills.
“You want the truth?” His shrug was lazy, practiced. “You’re not enough. But leaving you? That’s expensive. Cheaper than child support to stay.”

It wasn’t rage that hit her. Not grief. Just a slow, suffocating cold that started in her chest and spread until she could barely feel her hands.


After that, she lived like a shadow. She smiled when other moms waved at school drop-off. She still cooked dinner, still kissed the kids goodnight. But she slept on the very edge of the bed, her back to him, so far away she may as well have been in another house entirely.

She thought often about the girl she used to be. The one who would’ve walked away, head held high. The one who believed love was a safe place. That girl was dead. In her place was someone who was just… waiting.


It happened on a Tuesday.
The rain was heavy, hammering against the kitchen windows, the kind that blurred the world until it looked like a watercolor painting left in the sink.

She sat at the table with a pen and a scrap of paper. Her hands didn’t shake—she was too empty for that.

I can’t keep breathing in a house that’s already dead.

She set the note beside her coffee mug. The steam had stopped rising.

When she stepped outside, the rain soaked through her sweater instantly, plastering it to her skin. Her hair clung to her cheeks, her shoes filled with water. She didn’t hurry. She just kept walking, one street at a time, until the sound of the rain swallowed everything else.


By the time he came home, the coffee was cold. The letter was wrinkled, ink bleeding where a drop from the leaky ceiling had fallen. He read it once, twice, then crumpled it into his fist and tossed it in the trash.

The next morning, the children asked where Mommy was.

“She went away for a while,” he said, pouring milk into their cereal bowls.

He didn’t mention her again.",1,1755537522.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1mtsakd,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1mtsakd/reveal_if_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_by/,Reveal if the best single serve coffee maker by Keurig is worth it,"Keurig 062151516724 has been sitting on my countertop for a couple of months now, and it has quietly become part of my daily routine. Its sleek Twilight Blue design wasn't the initial draw, though it does earn its aesthetic points. No, what sold me was the promise of simplicity married with functionality—at least that's what I thought I was getting. This single-serve brewer makes some compelling claims, but does it deliver? Let me walk you through the highs and the, well, less-than-highs.

**Compact and Smart Design**  
The appeal of this coffee maker starts with its size. Measuring less than 12 cm in width, it truly fits anywhere. I’ve squeezed it between my stand mixer and toaster, and it doesn’t hog any counter space. The modern style makes it more of an accessory than an appliance. The water reservoir, sitting towards the back, is removable and holds a decent 1.36 liters. I managed to brew four solid cups before refilling, which is a game changer on groggy mornings when effort should be minimal. They’ve definitely nailed convenience with this design.

**Easy-to-Use Features**  
Using the coffee maker feels intuitive. It’s the epitome of push-button simplicity, which is perfect for someone like me who doesn’t want to fidget with complicated settings while still half-asleep. The three brew size options—237, 296, or 355 ml—are perfect, though I stick to the largest most days (life requires caffeine). The MultiStream Technology claims to extract full flavor and aroma in each cup, and I’m not going to lie, that first cup in the morning is indeed delicious. I also appreciate how quiet it runs; no jarring noises that make me regret my life choices before sunrise.

**Highlights**
- Extremely compact; fits on even the smallest countertops.  
- MultiStream Technology extracts deep flavor from K-Cup pods.  
- Three brew sizes accommodate varying caffeine needs.  
- Removable water reservoir simplifies refills.  

[Check Keurig 062151516724 price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b0bdt6htjj/)

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
Here’s the thing: the coffee is actually pretty great. I’ve tried several K-Cup pod varieties, ranging from basic breakfast blends to indulgent flavors like hazelnut and mocha, and every brew comes out smooth and aromatic. Admittedly, I did notice the MultiStream Technology does seem to bring out richer notes compared to an older Keurig I owned. That said, it doesn't quite match the depth of flavor you'd get with something like a French press or a high-end espresso machine.

**Drawbacks**  
Being a daily user, some shortcomings have come to light.  
- The lack of compatibility with coffee ground options limits versatility.  
- Brews can occasionally lack temperature consistency.  
- Larger cups (355 ml) sometimes feel slightly watered down compared to the smaller cups.  

**Maintenance and Durability**  
Cleaning has been a breeze. The drip tray pops out easily, and both the tray and reservoir are straightforward to rinse. However, the plastic build does leave me questioning longevity. It’s lightweight and fine for now, but how it holds up after a year of heavy daily use remains to be seen. My coworker had a Keurig model from a couple of years back, and he’s had to replace parts sooner than expected—so I’m cautiously optimistic.

**Competing Products**  
In this category, the Nespresso Essenza Mini and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew are direct competitors. The Nespresso model wins on espresso quality but lacks the simplicity and affordability of the coffee pods you get with this brewer. On the other hand, the FlexBrew offers the ability to brew with ground coffee or pods, making it more versatile, though it’s not nearly as compact. If counter space or portability is your top priority, this brewer stands out. For flavor connoisseurs or versatility lovers, competitors might hold a slight edge.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering its features, I think this is a reasonable investment, especially for people looking for no-frills, quick coffee solutions. Of course, it doesn’t have the fancy features higher-end machines boast, but it also doesn’t require you to take out a second mortgage. Given the space-saving design and quality of brew it delivers, I’d call it a solid mid-tier option. You won’t regret splurging on it, but you also won’t feel like you’re settling for less.

We'd be playing and he'd pin me down, him on top of me, his body is pressed against me and just staring at me for few minutes while i struggle to push him away, all while looking away cuz the smile on his face made me uncomfortable.

Another times where he'd bite my ear or make me kiss him forcefully on the mouth and if i didn't he'd express how sad he is and how much he wish i was still a kid and loved him forever.


Every time i see him I'm always stressed, him doing normal stuff like hugging me makes me flinchs, him saying i love you makes me disgusted, anything he does just makes me wanna die.

He was abusive to my mother, not bringing food to our house, toys were a waste of money, leaving the house wasn't a choice either. 

When i was younger i had fantasies about murdering him and killing myself afterwards, but right now i don't see him that often, maybe once or twice every year.

My dad was always in his room, lately he was depressed, not cleaning his house, sleeping in his messy car, Living on coffee, garbage everywhere, i feel really guilty for thinking about him this way, what if he's just lonely and he just wanted to be close to his kids and i got the wrong idea? What if I'm mistaking him playing with me for something else just because he was a shitty person?

1mts54t,https://nextupgrad.us/digital-marketing-services,Is Hiring a Digital Marketing Agency in New York Worth It?,"Hey Redditors,

I’ve been seeing a lot of buzz around [digital marketing agencies in New York](https://nextupgrad.us/digital-marketing-services), and I wanted to share some thoughts that might help small business owners or startups here.

Running a business in NYC is tough—there’s competition everywhere, whether you own a coffee shop in Brooklyn or a law firm in Manhattan. If people can’t find you online, chances are they’ll choose your competitor. That’s where digital marketing agencies step in.

They usually handle things like **SEO (getting your website on Google), social media marketing, PPC ads, content creation, and email campaigns**. Basically, all the stuff that helps your business get noticed online.

Some quick stats that blew my mind:

* **93% of online experiences start with a search engine**.
* Businesses that blog get **55% more visitors** than those that don’t.
* Social media ads reached **4.9 billion people worldwide in 2023**.

So yeah, having an online presence is no longer optional—it’s a must. A **New York digital marketing agency** can help you stand out in this crowded city and actually grow.",1,1755537183.0,u_Outside_Wasabi9093,0,1.0,False

Well… I’m going to a new event tonight, and the host is CUTE, definitely my type. 

Last week, I had a question about the event for tonight, so I messaged her on the app. We made small talk for a bit, and she even commented that she loved my profile picture, (a selfie of me doing one of my hobbies,) and that we were excited to meet each other at tonight’s event.

Well the event is tonight from 7-9pm, planning on just being social/friendly with everyone, making new friends, asking for phone numbers to connect, especially hers. 

After I get her number tonight, in about 2 days, I plan on texting her.

1mts479,https://www.reddit.com/r/thegildedage/comments/1mts479/bridgetjack_a_deep_dive_s13/,Bridget/Jack: A Deep Dive (S1-3),"My two cents on the “Bridget only likes Jack in 3x08 because he’s rich now” discourse. 

...The short answer is “Lol no,” but the long answer is this deep dive.

Having rewatched the earlier episodes, I’d say **Bridget has been** ***pining*** **for Jack since Season 1.** Also, **Jack** ***knows*** **this and for the most part, up until 3x08, he doesn’t really care.**

**Jack’s Interest in Bridget**

We don’t really know why Jack liked Bridget to begin with. We *assume* it's because she's young, sweet, pretty, and his coworker, and we don’t see much warm feeling from Jack towards her after she brutally rejects him until 3x08. Other than working in the same household, they don’t have much in common. They both have tragic pasts, but he wouldn’t have known that when he asked her out. She’s cute, but I don’t see much evidence of a grand passion there. We know he’s lonely and wants to be loved, and she’s, well, right there. This might explain while he’s able to move on to Adelheid after Bridget shoots him down, since Adelheid is also young, cute and convenient (since she works across the street and he can see her with little effort). 

Also, while he has occasionally confided in Bridget, he doesn’t seem overly interested in Bridget as a person. It’s not even clear why he likes her, since he never admires her, compliments her or praises her. He only rarely asks for her opinion across three seasons even though they’ve had multiple conversations. 

Even when Bridget recoils when he tries to touch her during their horrible S1 date, he *seems* to assume it’s because he disgusts her rather than questioning it any further. He shows a curious, questioning mind the rest of the time, but Bridget violently shuts him down when he tries to touch her and he’s all, “Welp, live and learn.”

**Bridget's Interest in Jack**

**Season 1**

1x03

Jack invites Bridget to a magic lantern show. Bridget is not into the idea at *all,* first saying she’ll have to think about it and then later saying she hadn’t agreed and only relents at Mrs. Bauer’s urging.

She enjoys herself enough at the show, but she recoils when Jack attempts to put his arm around her. After the show, she refuses to go with him for a coffee or ice cream, insists on going straight back, and turns him down when he asks to hold her hand: **“I’ve told you, I don’t like that stuff.”** 

**This is the** ***last*** **time that Jack shows any romantic interest in Bridget, lets alone makes** ***any*** **kind of move, until 3x08.** Given her pretty stinging rejection here, it’s small wonder. **After this point, though, the tables turn: Bridget shows lots of interest in Jack, and he notices but does not reciprocate.** 

1x04:

Mrs. Bauer laments that Bridget doesn’t like Jack, and Bridget sharply says that he’s nice enough to work with. When Mrs. Bauer suggests that Bridget’s mother would agree that Bridget wouldn’t see much romance if she won’t let a man hold her hand, Bridget bitterly agrees. She later confides in Mrs. Bauer that she hates her mother because her mother “sat downstairs” and allowed a man in the household to do terrible things to her. We don’t know who the man was, but the fact that she can’t even bring herself to say it aloud and whispers it to Mrs. Bauer suggests it’s her father: **“He was mad, but she was evil.”** 

This seems to explain Bridget’s rejection of Jack as stemming from her past trauma. It also explains why she was so hesitant to go on the outing with him in the first place.  

1x08: 

Jack asks for time off and takes flowers with him. Bridget asks him about where he’s going, and he refuses to tell her. When he gets back, she asks him how it went, fishing for information, and Jack doesn’t take the bait.

Bridget: Did you have a nice time?  
**Jack: Wouldn’t you like to know?**

Bridget asks Mrs. Bauer about it, and Mrs. Bauer says that he’s clearly lying but that’s it’s his business. Mrs. Bauer is fine with leaving Jack his privacy, but Bridget refuses to drop it. The next time Jack has an afternoon off and heads out with flowers, Bridget wants to follow him. Mrs. Bauer isn’t a fan and calls her out for being interested in Jack.

Bridget: I think he's bought flowers just like the last time. He hid them when he went up to serve. 

**Mrs. Bauer: You're not being fair.** 

Bridget: Let me follow him.

Mrs. Bauer: What? 

Bridget: You can tell Mr. Bannister that I'm running some errands for you. 

**Mrs. Bauer: Oh, you're only interested in Jack because he's found someone else.** 

And Bridget doesn’t deny this, either…?

Bridget: Come on. You know you're curious. 

**Mrs. Bauer: You're not to spoil his fun. He's entitled to visit another young lady.** What would you say if he sees you? 

Bridget then proceeds to stalk Jack all the way to the cemetery. This is not a short trip, either, because at the end of their conversation in the cemetery, Jack tells her they need to “make tracks for the ferry,” meaning that the cemetery was a ferry ride away. **Bridget was so obsessed with Jack’s new girl that she took the ferry to follow him!** 

Jack isn’t impressed, either, when he notices her at the cemetery, and calls her out. Ashamed, Bridget lies that **“Mrs. Bauer and I…we wondered who you were taking flowers to.”** We know this is a straight-up lie, since Mrs. Bauer did not wonder at all, but Bridget is trying to play this off as simple curiosity. Jack isn’t having it:

**Jack: Because I'd replaced you in my fickle heart with a new girl?** 

And Bridget doesn’t deny it!

**Bridget: Something like that.** (Anachronistic dialogue imo, but moving along…)

He goes on to confide in her about his mother and bitterly concludes that his mother was the only woman who ever loved him, which probably explains something about his eagerness to find love. If he’d asked her about her *own* mother, Bridget *might* have opened up to him and saved them both a lot of grief, but Jack of course doesn’t bother.

**Ironically enough, in Season 2, Jack** ***does*** **replace Bridget in his “fickle heart” with “a new girl,” namely Adelheid, whom he pursues throughout Season 2, so I guess Jack was telling on himself.**

1x09:

Bridget approaches Jack (not the other way around, notably) and Jack happily chats with her about the ball. Jack says about being invited to the ball one day, “Maybe we will be one day. After all, this is America.”

**Season 2**

In Season 2, Jack shows no romantic interest whatsoever in Bridget, having moved on to Adelheid Weber (a lady’s maid in the Russell), whom he chats/flirts with throughout the season in the street. (He also takes her out for coffee at least once that we know of, from dialogue.) It’s all fairly light and they spend most of their scenes chatting lightly; their only serious conversation is the coffee argument in 3x01. There’s no indication that he’s secretly pining for Bridget or using Adelheid to get her attention, though, and he shuts down Bridget’s various attempts to pry.

As with Bridget, there’s no indication why Jack is interested in Adelheid in particular, other than her being young, sweet, and cute. She seems a convenient choice, since she works across the street and he doesn’t have to go out of his way to speak to her. 

Jack doesn’t seem to have much interest in Bridget at *all* in Season 2, romantic or otherwise. He shuts down or ignores her comments about Adelheid and focuses on Adelheid and his patent application. During the patent process, Bridget is the one approaching *him*, asking *him* questions and paying attention to *his* mood, not the other way around.

So in S2, Jack genuinely likes Adelheid and is not shy about it. Bridget on the other hand is *seething with jealousy* and is not shy about that, either. 

…It’s giving Darcy and Caroline Bingley, if I’m being honest.

2x01:

Jack approaches Adelheid at the Easter service to flirt with her, having obtained her name from one of the footmen. Bridget finds out about this later when Jack is asked about what he was discussing with Miss Weber.

In a later scene, Adelheid hangs out with the Van Rhijn servants, presumably at Jack’s invitation. Adelheid is nothing but gracious and sweet, but Bridget is still rude to her: **“I hope you don't mind my saying so, but you seem very young to be a lady's maid to Mrs. Russell.”**

Bridget later approaches Jack when he’s lost in thought outside and starts asking him some pretty impertinent questions about Adelheid.

Bridget: What are you doing? 

Jack: Just thinking. 

**Bridget: About Miss Weber?** 

Jack: What are you talking about? 

**Bridget: You like her. Are you making plans?** 

Jack: No. But I won't be a footman all my life. (…) I’m interested in a lot of things, but I'm not sure how to turn any of them into a living. 

**Bridget: Perhaps Miss Weber could help.**

Jack: Eh. I’m going inside. It’s cold.

Jack cuts the conversation short when Bridget wants to keep talking about Adelheid, and it’s about as close as Jack has ever gotten to being rude to anyone on the show (apart from his anger when Bridget followed him to the cemetery in 1x08).

The funny thing is that Jack is actually opening up somewhat to Bridget here, but she ignores that because she can't help herself from bugging him about Adelheid.

2x02:

Bridget is playing cards with Jack and is *very* into it (taking cards with gusto, slamming cards on the table and such), even though Jack is distracted during most of it. It’s pretty sad, since playing cards is probably a “safe” way for her to interact with him without physical contact, and she is way more into it than he is, again a sign that his heart is elsewhere. 

And *again* Bridget is back on her Adelheid bullshit, and *again* Mrs. Bauer is sticking up for Jack’s interest in another girl:

**Bridget (playfully, unprompted): I saw you talking to that Miss Weber yesterday.**

**Mrs. Bauer: And why shouldn’t he?**

And Jack quietly shuts Bridget down:

**Jack: I like her.**

2x03:

The servants gossip about the opera war, and Bridget *again* brings up Miss Weber unprompted when Jack says that he supports the Met.

Jack: It’s what I think, that’s all.

**Bridget: You only think that because Miss Adelheid Weber does.**

Jack says nothing.

2x06:

Bridget is the first one to notice that something’s up with Jack (who is upset over the rejection of his application). It makes sense, since she pays more attention to him than anyone else.

**Bridget: Are you all right? You’ve been in a funny mood all morning.**

Bridget does approach Jack outside later, their first conversation alone since 2x01, and again, as with their other conversations alone, *she* is approaching *him*, not vice versa. Again, he’s cold towards her, although in his defence he’s on the verge of tears and probably wanted to be alone:

**Bridget: Pay no mind to Miss Armstrong. What does she know anyway? You're doing something none of us could ever imagine. So keep at it. Promise.** 

Jack: I promise. I guess.

2x08:

Bridget again gives another sign to Jack that she has been paying close attention to him, which prompts him to reveal that his application was approved.

**Bridget: You’re very quiet. You have been all day.**

And Bridget can’t restrain herself from spilling the beans about his patent application to the other servants because she is just that happy for him. (Contrast this with Mrs. Bauer, who spilled the news about Jack's fortune to Bannister and Miss Armstrong to win an argument.)

**Season 3**

Jack still doesn’t seem to show any interest in Bridget until 3x08 (arguably 3x06, I guess), after his relationship with Adelheid ends, even though she is just as sweetly supportive of his business ventures as the rest of the servants. And again, there's no indication that he was secretly in love with Bridget when he was with Adelheid. If Adelheid hadn't lost it on him over the coffee fiasco, he probably would have continued courting her after her return from England and probably married her eventually. 

3x01:

Conveniently and out of nowhere, Adelheid is nasty to Jack over his supposed slight to a footman by making a servant who outranks him serve him coffee, tells him he’s getting above himself, and warns him that he’s not in favour downstairs. We’ve never had any hint before this that Adelheid had these opinions about Jack’s rise, so Adelheid’s little rant all seems like a contrivance from the writers to clear Adelheid out of the way as an obstacle. 

Jack tries to shrug this off but is clearly upset about Adelheid’s comments since he is the one to bring her up to the other servants later, when previously he didn’t like discussing her at all.

**Jack: It was something Adelheid said.**

Before he even gets into what she said, and *even without knowing that Adelheid said something nasty*, Bridget is on it:

**Bridget (sarcastically): What do we have to thank her for now?**

3x03:

Bridget praises Jack’s suit.

3x06:

Jack asks Bridget for a private moment before he leaves. It’s not overtly romantic, since he’s only asking her to deliver the envelopes, but I guess you could read into it that he chose her to be the last person he saw at the house before leaving. He could have asked anyone else to do this for him, so why pick her and not Bannister to do the honours?

Bridget tries to be encouraging, but there are tears in her eyes and her face falls after he leaves.

Jack: After I'm gone, will you give these to everyone? There's one for all of you and the ladies upstairs. 

**Bridget: Of course. You'll keep in touch and let us know where you'll be.** 

And he calls her “Bridget,” for the first time since Season 1.

**Jack: I will. Goodbye, Bridget.** 

**Bridget: Goodbye, Jack.**

3x07:

Bridget isn’t sure what to do with the money Jack gave her. Mrs. Bauer encourages her to buy the dress she has her eye on:

**Bridget: Even if I did buy it, I don't have any place to wear it.** 

**Mrs. Bauer: I think every woman should have a party dress, just in case.** 

And we get what sounds like a possible ironic hint about Bridget’s future.

**Bridget: I’ll never have extra money like this again.** Saving it is probably the safer thing to do.

3x08:

Jack comes by the house to hang out and talks about his new household. He complains about his cook and reveals when asked that there are two women who come in every day to clean.

**Bridget: Are they young women?**

Jack: I suppose so.

When Bridget asks about this, Armstrong, Bannister and Mrs. Bauer all exchange a Look between themselves. Mrs. Bauer has noticed Bridget’s jealousy before in S1, but this is the first time when Armstrong and Bannister have reacted to Bridget’s jealousy as well.

And then later, Bridget shows up to Jack’s with Mrs. Bauer’s lamb stew. **She’s wearing a new dress, which seems to be implied to be the dress she was eyeing in 3x07.** Jack is pleasantly surprised to see her. When Bridget tries to go into servant mode serving his meal, he asks her to stay and is uncharacteristically solicitous towards her:

**Jack: Thank you. It was very thoughtful of Mrs. Bauer. And of you to bring it. Aren't you having any?** 

**Bridget: I ate before I came.** 

**Jack: Won't you at least sit down?** 

**Bridget: I’m a servant.** 

**Jack: Not in this house. No, in this house, you're a guest of the master.** 

**Bridget: Do you mean it?**

**Jack: Of course I do. I’m honoured to welcome you. It feels very safe with you here. Can I say that without making you feel uncomfortable?** 

**Bridget: I’m not uncomfortable. Not at all.** 

**Jack: All right, then. Now tell me about your day.** 

**Bridget: Well, this morning, when I was starting to prepare breakfast...**

It’s a cute scene, but it’s a pretty damn dramatic departure from previous episodes for a few reasons:

1. Jack is making a move, for the first time since S1. He has known this whole time that Bridget likes him, and even assuming S2 was a wash because he was pursuing Adelheid, this is the first time he has attempted do anything about it.
2. The first allusion by Jack to knowing that he messed up with Bridget the first time because he made her uncomfortable. He has never acknowledged this before.
3. Jack actually shows interest in what’s going on in Bridget’s life. Even asking her about her day is a big change.

And if you really think about it, where was this energy before? He could have been this understanding and kind to her the whole time she was pining for him and just chose not to?

Cynically, you could say that the reason for this renewed interest is because Bridget is once more convenient: he’s single, he’s lonely, his cook sucks, and a pretty girl he used to have a crush on shows up bringing him much better food than he’s been getting at home. What could be more convenient than that? Might as well shoot his shot.

The romantic in me, though, wants Bridget’s obsessive level of interest in Jack to be truly reciprocated. It would mean more if Jack chooses Bridget even when he’s spoiled for choice for potential wives and she is the *inconvenient* choice, due to the new class differential between them, and not simply because he’s desperately lonely in his huge new house and all the eligible ladies haven't yet figured out that there's a new marriage prospect in town.

**TLDR: Bridget has been obsessed with Jack since S1 and not just because he's newly rich, whereas Jack obsessed with Bridget? Not so much.**",4,1755537123.0,thegildedage,7,0.83,False

1mts1be,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/comments/1mts1be/andaz_san_diego_my_personal_review/,"Andaz San Diego, My Personal Review","I recently stayed at the Andaz San Diego in the Gaslamp Quarter, using 23,000 World of Hyatt points and a Guest of Honor (GOH) award, which I used mainly to secure the breakfast and free parking benefit. This was my first time at this particular Andaz property, though I’ve stayed at others in Mexico City and in Hollywood. I was curious to see how this property meets the Andaz branding, which Hyatt positions as upscale, stylish, locally rooted, and guest-focused ([https://www.hyatt.com/andaz](https://www.hyatt.com/andaz)). What I found was a mostly disappointing experience that left me wondering how/why this hotel operates under the Andaz brand.

**Arrival & Check-In**

The front desk agent was warm, friendly, and immediately recognized the Guest of Honor award. She explained that we had been upgraded to a Deluxe King because suites weren't available (though mysteriously several suites were available to book online the entire time we were there, lol). I'm really not that guest who is just trying to get free things, but Hyatt really gets a lot of advertising traction from the promised upgrades to standard suites ""as available"" as a Globalist/GOH benefit. Still, the check-in interaction itself was otherwise perfectly pleasant.

**The Room**

Our Deluxe King on the 5th floor was nicely decorated, with stylish furnishings and a unique bathroom layout. The shower was cool/different: it's essentially a glass box between the bedroom and bathroom, with a curtain that can be drawn from the bedroom side. This gives you natural light in the bathroom but does assume a level of comfort with whoever you’re sharing the room with (a fine assumption, IMO). The sofa converts into a bed, making it theoretically possible to sleep several guests in the room, though it would be an extremely tight squeeze. The only noticeable signs of wear were on the sofa cushions and fabric, which were a bit ragged from use. Bathrobes weren’t in the room initially but arrived quickly when requested via the app. Rooms were equipped with coffee machines and K-cups, something for which I'm always thankful. The Andaz brand also offers complimentary in-room snacks; we had a few cans of water, chips, and packaged cookies.

One major downside: noise--and not normal city street noise. Our first room was unbearable due to incessant thumping from the rooftop party, and we ended up asking to move. (More about this rooftop party in a second!) The room move was handled fine, though after handing me the keys to a new room on the 3rd floor to be farther away from the rooftop, the front desk agent told me to call down to the lobby once I had finished moving. I'm probably being way too picky, but this felt like being assigned a task when I was already annoyed. In the new room, the rooftop party noise was blessedly much less noticeable, and after closing and locking the (dirty and inexplicably slightly open) windows by squeezing under an interior storm window, noise was further reduced. Sound machines were also provided, likely an acknowledgment of the street/party noise typical of the Gaslamp Quarter.

**Pool & Rooftop**

After checking in and getting settled in the room, we went to the roof to check out the pool. The rooftop pool has just 13 loungers (all full when we arrived), plus three large cabanas and two daybeds that require paid reservations. The pool itself is shallow (3 feet deep throughout), so it seems more like a pool for standing around with cocktails, which sounds fine to me. However small or shallow, a rooftop pool is always fun. Cocktails were $18 (tasty, but small pours), or you could spring for a $38 bucket of 5 White Claws or beers. Towels were plentiful and servers were attentive, which were positives.

But the atmosphere was another story--and this is where the property really stumbled. During our visit, there was a rooftop party open to the public with a band playing some kind of aggressive mariachi fusion. (Trumpets! AMPLIFIED!) Annoyingly, the hotel’s normal pool soundtrack was still playing at the same time. The result was the sound of chaos—the description ""manic carnival from hell"" comes to mind. It all felt like a very poorly planned attempt at creating a party scene that felt more early-2000s W Hotel than a modern Andaz. Some partygoers were parading around, leaving very little to the imagination in neon fishnet tube dresses; elsewhere, someone's uncle was crushing Modelos in a wet white undershirt in the pool in the inflatable pink flamingo. The atmosphere was so unpleasant and stressful we closed our tab quickly and left.

To the staff’s credit, when I mentioned my bemusement at the competing soundtracks, one server laughed and shrugged it off, saying, “two totally different vibes, I know right?!”—a moment of candor that made me feel seen but also puzzled: if a staff person clearly noticed this, why hadn't it been addressed? Another server later told me it was the first time they had booked that particular band and, correctly noticing my annoyance, invited us back for a nightcap after 10 PM when the party was scheduled to be done. A nice gesture, but we were in town for an extremely early morning the following day. The final straw was trying to retreat to our (first) room, only to find that the music and bass were so loud, you could hear the noise and feel the bass from a few floors above. 

Instead, we decided to check out the happy hour in the lobby, offered daily from 5–8 PM. In reality, this happy hour is just the front desk agent giving you a glass of wine or beer in a plastic cup. Lobby seating is very limited, with only a 4-chair grouping in the lobby and two dramatic stylized chairs facing the elevators. While we were sipping our wine, I studied the lobby a bit. There's a water station with a microwave tucked underneath, and the area opposite the front desk is set up like a little store area with snacks (instant ramen explains the lobby microwave) and a few coolers of drinks. The walls were adorned with cheap-looking artwork of an Eiffel Tower (is this Andaz ""reflecting local culture""?) and two giant giraffe sculptures wearing San Diego Padres jerseys (ah yes there's the local culture) stood guard next to the front desk. Drinking wine from plastic cups in a sparse, awkward lobby felt weird and sad. The vibe was definitely ""hostel""--not ""boutique hotel"".

**Breakfast**

The next morning, breakfast on the rooftop was, thankfully, an entirely different and calm experience. The restaurant space was nearly empty. When we appeared at the restaurant entrance, the host acknowledged us from across the dining room (which was nice) but called out to us from afar and motioned with his head where we should sit (which felt sloppy). The breakfast itself (covered by the GOH award) was fine but completely unremarkable.

**Departure & Valet Parking**

The hotel is valet-only, at $65/night. While steep, that's unfortunately not uncommon at hotels nowadays. With the GOH award, parking was included. The valet system uses a QR code on your claim ticket that generates a text message notifying the valets to retrieve your car. When we were ready to depart, we scanned the code and received a reply via text message informing us that our car would be around in about 20 minutes. After waiting more than 20 minutes, I stepped outside to investigate and discovered my car sitting at the curb; there was no follow-up message and nobody came into the lobby to let us know.

**Final Thoughts**

Hyatt’s own Andaz brand description promises properties that reflect local culture with upscale sociability, seamless design, and thoughtful touches like a welcome drink and no traditional front desk (though I'm not sure I get why anybody would care about no traditional front desk). The Andaz San Diego has none of that. There is a perfectly standard front desk, no welcome beverage, lobby that feels like a hostel, and a rooftop party scene that felt totally disconnected from the brand’s supposed ethos. The only element that felt moderately upscale were the guest room furnishings. Other than the rooms being too nice, I could see this property making more sense as a Hyatt Place/House.

This stay left me disappointed--not only in this property, but also in Hyatt’s inconsistent branding more generally. I redeemed a Guest of Honor award here expecting a moderately upscale stay in downtown San Diego. Instead, I found a chaotic party hotel that seemed uninterested in honoring the suite upgrade benefit or delivering anything remotely close to the Andaz brand description. I have future reservations here but am now hesitant to return. At the very least, if I keep my future reservations, I’ll call ahead to ask about rooftop events: if another one of their parties open to the public is scheduled, I will cancel and book elsewhere.

For those considering this hotel: if you want a party atmosphere in the Gaslamp Quarter, honestly, this property would probably be just perfect. But if you’re looking for the slightly more upscale experience Hyatt advertises, you won’t find it here. At this point the only reason I would return is if I need to stay in San Diego and 1. there is no rooftop party scheduled and 2. if the rates are considerably lower than the nearly Manchester Grand Hyatt, an immensely boring but consistent conference hotel.",6,1755536949.0,hyatt,4,1.0,False

My mom, grandma, aunt, and godmother all passed away and things have been a mess since. 

I’ve had big dreams of going to med school but job lay offs and financial insecurity and I’ve subsequent anxiety and depression have made that seem basically impossible now. 

Last week I got an incredible lead. It was for a midwife business that looked a lot like the medical startup I wanted to start. I had coffee with the founder and the role she’s designing looked exactly like the experience I’d want to build and the exact kind of work I’d want to be doing. She said I’d be a good fit and she’d reach out once she had the job description written out. I prayed for this. Tried to be patient and reasonable. Today she said she’d actually prefer someone with more direct birth experience. I feel gutted. I have no job. I’m afraid. I keep getting rejected and beaten down. Hope hurts and trying to pray to god for change and relief or comfort hurts even more. 

I feel like I’ve lost all my promise and no one’s willing to take a chance on me. I’ve had to defer from my school program 3 times. I have autism and I’m grieving. I really desperately want to feel like I can take care of myself and be of help to others. I’m not myself lately. I just wish god would help me. I feel cursed and trying my best isn’t good enough these days. ",1,1755536939.0,OpenChristian,0,1.0,False
1mtrzri,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1mtrzri/reveal_if_the_best_espresso_machine_delonghi/,Reveal if the best espresso machine DeLonghi Dedica Arte is worth it,"Testing out the De'Longhi EC885M espresso machine has been an interesting adventure, especially since I’m surrounded by coffee enthusiasts who don’t take their espresso lightly. As someone who enjoys experimenting with coffee, from the simplest espressos to latte art sessions that occasionally go awry, this little gadget has found a place in my daily routine. It’s not without its quirks, but that’s half the charm of diving into the world of home espresso machines.

**Compact Design for Space-Saving Enthusiasts**

The first thing that caught my eye was the size of this machine. Measuring only about 6 inches wide, it takes up less space than most toasters. This is perfect for my tiny apartment kitchen, where counter space competes with cutting boards, air fryers, and the occasional pile of paperwork. The stainless-steel finish not only feels sturdy but also adds a sort of sophistication—it’s the kind of appliance you want people to notice when they visit. My partner, who’s somewhat of a minimalist, grudgingly admitted that it actually looks nice next to our boring black appliances.

**Brew Quality Like a Pro at Home**

Using the De'Longhi EC885M brings the café experience closer to home. With its 15-bar professional pressure, I’m no longer suffering through subpar coffee from pods every morning. I used to think my local café barista had some kind of magic touch, but now I realize the secret lies partially in having the right equipment. I particularly enjoyed experimenting with the professional tamper and large filter basket, which accommodates up to 18g of coffee grounds. Every cup feels consistent, rich, and velvety, with a thick crema that screams “pro-barista vibes.” One of my coworkers even commented on how my routine cup tasted better than what she gets at her usual café!

**Upsides**

- Compact and stylish at just 6 inches wide, fitting seamlessly in small kitchens.
- Delivers exceptional brew quality with the 15-bar pressure system.
- Professional tamping and filtering system allow authentic barista-quality beverages.
- Steam wand makes creating latte art approachable and fun.
- Adjustable drip tray accommodates taller glasses effortlessly.

[Check De'Longhi EC885M price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b09hlb4dp4/)

**Mastering Milk Frothing with My LatteArt Wand**

The My LatteArt steam wand is a delightful addition, and even someone like me—who isn’t exactly an artist—managed to make somewhat recognizable heart and flower patterns in my cappuccinos. Its precision is fantastic, creating smooth, velvety microfoam. My sister had a go at it too, and while her leaf art ended up looking like a blob, she was excited to practice more. I’ve also used this for non-coffee drinks, like frothy hot chocolate or Chai lattes, which turned out surprisingly well. It’s definitely a selling point for anyone who values café-style drinks.

**Ease of Use for Beginners and Experts Alike**

Operating the machine is genuinely straightforward. The Automatic Flow Stop feature is a lifesaver because I used to always overfill my cups with other machines. Now, I just press a button, and the correct amount of espresso is dispensed. Cleaning is also refreshingly simple. Both the drip tray and water tank are removable, making rinsing and reattaching a hassle-free task. That said, I feel like beginners might go through a learning curve, especially with setting the right grind size and tamping pressure.

**Negatives**

- Slight learning curve for beginners to achieve perfect results.
- Requires regular maintenance to avoid build-up around steam wand and filters.
- Smaller water tank requires frequent refills if making multiple drinks.

**Competitive Options**

When comparing this to similar espresso machines in its category, like Breville’s Bambino or Gaggia Classic, the trade-offs become clearer. Breville machines, for instance, may offer faster heat-up times thanks to their ThermoJet technology, but they are often bulkier and pricier. On the other hand, Gaggia Classic machines are well-regarded for their durability but lack the slim design and modern aesthetics of the De'Longhi unit. What sets this product apart is its blend of compactness and user-friendly functionality, making it ideal for cramped living spaces without compromising drink quality.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

Considering its extensive features, this espresso machine feels like a solid investment for coffee lovers who want café-quality results at home. The price point reflects its build quality and the experience of creating professional-grade beverages without stepping out of your house. Compared to higher-priced competitors with similar functionality, this machine offers good balance if you’re on a mid-range budget—it won’t break the bank, yet it delivers premium results.

*August 18, 2025 — Gil Vicente’s Turf: Where Dreams Go to Die (and Occasionally Score)*

The numbers don’t lie, and in this case, they’re screaming. FC Porto, Portugal’s soccer equivalent of a caffeinated superhero, is a **-1.25-goal spread favorite** and sits at **decimal odds of 1.39 (≈71.9% implied probability)** to win outright. Gil Vicente, meanwhile, is priced at **8.0 (≈12.5% implied probability)**, which is about the same chance as correctly guessing someone’s birthday blindfolded. Even the draw (4.6 odds ≈ 21.7%) feels like a Hail Mary from a team that’s never met a net it couldn’t miss.

### Parsing the Odds: Why FC Porto Is Soccer’s Version of a Coffee Addict

Porto’s dominance is as baked in as a *pastel de nata*. Their -1.25 spread line means they’re expected to win by *at least two goals*, which feels generous given their recent form. Historically, Porto thrives on offense like a kid in a candy store—last season, they averaged 2.3 goals per game, while Gil Vicente’s defense looked like a sieve trying to hold water in a monsoon (2.1 goals conceded per game).

The total goals line is set at **2.5**, with odds hovering around 1.9 (≈52.6% implied). Given Porto’s attacking prowess and Gil Vicente’s porous defense, “Over” feels like the logical pick… unless you’ve seen Gil Vicente’s midfield try to keep a secret. Their players might as well wear “Guess Where the Pass Is Going?” T-shirts.

### News Digest: Injuries, Yoga, and a Cat Named Ronaldo

1mtrv00,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1mtrv00/i_ended_things_with_someone_and_now_im_wondering/,I ended things with someone and now I'm wondering if I should apologize and try to maintain contact?,"We've only been speaking for a couple of weeks. In that short time it has already been an emotional roller-coaster. Things started out sexually charged (won't get into the details but she initially reached out to me and expressed interest in hooking up, she knew we live in the same area). We exchanged numbers and spent a lot of time texting after that, talking about our lives, sharing music, chatting, but also flirting and sexting. We met for coffee, but didn't hook up or anything. She said she had an appointment she had to go to. She texted me later and after chatting a bit starting sending sexy pics and sexting. I kind of enjoyed building things up and taking it sort of slow (for our times anyway) while still having some sexual excitement.

We continued texting 3-4 days, and things seemed to be going well . She asked me to propose a definite plan for our next meeting/date. I proposed one and thought it was a bit strange how long it was taking her to reply but didn't press on it. The next day she said she wasn't interested anymore, rather curtly. I said okay, and just asked to clarify if that meant no contact at all going forward. A few hours pass (rather long for her to reply based on past texting habits) and she proposes being just friends. I thought about saying yes but then I thought about how the friendship dynamic might be and didn't respond right away.

After some time passed she apologized, said she just started feeling really dreadful about hooking up in general and hasn't had sex in a while due to past bad experiences. I said that was okay, and that I did not necessarily even assume we'd be hooking up after 2nd date (which was true despite the sexting, of course I thought we might but I thought it was also possible we might just kiss or something, so I guess I did expect something physical tbf but was happy with just hanging out and talking again too). So I said why don't we continue but in a more slow/traditional dating situation. She agreed, said how happy she was we were talking again. I thought all was well.

We meet for the second date. Things seems to be going well enough. I will admit a few things kinda rubbed me the wrong way. She expressed great joy in seeing men fight and draw blood, and brought up having a famous ex (maybe this is insecure on my part, I don't think I felt threatened exactly but it seemed a bit strange to bring up this early on to me and felt kinda shoehorned into the conversation, maybe I'm overly sensitive or reading too much into it). I don't think we'd set a time limit, she did say before she had some other obligations after but that she was looking forward to more plans. After about an hour, she said she was looking forward to a future plan we'd made, then kinda rushed off with a ""see ya!"". While there had been a few things I thought were concerning, I can't point to one specific thing she did that I felt was a total dealbreaker, but something about the combination of these things (also some I won't mention from realier on) felt off to me. I felt conflicted and had a sort of strong thought/feeling that maybe I wasn't interested after all.

I didn't text her that evening because of this feeling and I had some plans with a friend. She was normally texting at least once every 3 hours or so so I looked for a text from her later that evening, but didn't send one myself (maybe I should have? idk). The next day she mentioned the day before was her sabbath and she tries not to text. She had been sending good morning messages most days, but she didn't send one. Although we'd texted on that day the prior week, I felt self conscious about texting her since she mentioned it was the sabbath for her, so I did not text her (thought I did consider it). I decided if she didn't text me good morning the next day I'd consider ending things, just because it was starting to feel too hot/cold and confusing for me. She didn't, so about half way through the day I sent her a text saying hi and asking how she was. No reply (again, I've only known her a short time but she normally would reply within 30 minutes to an hour unless she mentioned being at work on a specific task or something). I admit I was starting to feel emotional after a couple of hours passed, I calmed myself by thinking I wouldn't think too much into someone else not replying or not talking for a couple of days (including people I've dated before). Still, I felt something wasn't right. I decided I wanted to break things off (petty, but I also thought I'd prefer to before she does, assuming the lack of contact is leading to her wanting to end things like last time). I waited an hour or so more and then sent a text saying that I enjoyed getting to know her but I didn't feel like things were working out. Her not initiating contact for the past couple days or replying to this message made me think she may feel the same way. Then some well wishes if we don't speak again. Since then, nothing (as one would expect I suppose). I did notice she seems to have removed all messages and blocked me from the app she originally reached out to me on, so I guess it's final (I am not 100% sure these weren't already deleted, she maybe didn't want the pics or messages saved or shared).

Now I'm having second thoughts. On the one hand it's kind of nice to be off the emotional roller coaster, but I did enjoy talking to her and wonder if maybe we'd be better as friends without the romantic/sexual issues. She was really kind and supportive in a lot of ways during the time we talked. I am generally very bad at ending things with people and have a desire to keep contact open at all costs unless they've done something I consider very bad, so I'm usually the one ghosted or broken up with. I also think about some of the future plans we'd talked about and how fun they'd be because my other friends aren't into those things. I wonder if I apologized if we could patch things up as friends? or if I even should? Then I think maybe there's a lot I don't know about her (there were a few other odd things I haven't mentioned here) and at this point we've already had this many issues so it's maybe best to just move on (and I may be debasing myself for nothing if I try to reach out at this point anyway)..",1,1755536578.0,WhatShouldIDo,1,1.0,False

## 📍Chow Food Truck 

(different location in Dallas area depending on the week.)
www.chowfoodtruck.com

Ordered:
- Loaded fries with sticky chicken
- Sticky beef plate
- Cucumber salad

My husband and I went here and were definitely full sharing 2 plates and a cucumber salad.

It's 100% gluten-free and veteran owned. If you like Hawaiian fusion food, their sticky beef (kalbi) was so good and tasted just like I remember having at Hawaiian plate places. I wanted to try their chicken wings but they were sold out. They said the next batch needed to brine for 24 hours before they were ready to cook. 
 

## 📍 Selda Mediterranean Kitchen

9250 Dallas Pkwy Suite 130, 
Frisco, Texas, USA 75033 

I tried:
- Cauliflower 
- Halloumi 
- Lamb shank (my order)
- Beef shish (husband's order)
- Turkish coffee

We went as a family of 5. The complimentary bread isn't gluten-free and some of the dishes my in-laws ordered weren't gluten-free so I didn't include photos of those dishes.

This Turkish restaurant has a dedicated fryer and a marked menu. 

The cauliflower looks small but it was actually a big family style bowl. It was incredible and my favorite thing that we ordered.


## 📍Terry Black's BBQ

3025 Main St, 

Dallas, Texas, USA 75226

We went as a family of 4 (and had leftovers.)

Ordered:
- Beef rib
- Cheddar sausage 
- Brisket
- Creamed corn 
- Onions

Hands down the best beef ribs ever. The bark on the bbq makes my mouth water just thinking about it. They have a marked gluten-free menu and the bread is serve-yourself-style at a different part of the restaurant, so it won't contaminate your food.

## About BBQ Prices.

People lost their minds about the price the last time I posted about this place in February 2025 so I ended up deleting that post. The prices everywhere already went up since February 2025, by about 2 dollars.

Terry Black's BBQ is comparable in price to other restaurants that serve championship level pit BBQ that's ranked in Texas Monthly magazine. 

Examples:

## The 4 Michelin Star Texas BBQ restaurants 

👉 Corkscrew BBQ

- Brisket - $36 / lb
- Sides - $8 / pint

👉 LA Barbeque

No beef ribs on menu
- Brisket - $42 / lb (per Google reviewer in 2024)
- Smoked vegetables - $30 / lb (per Google reviewer in 2024)
- Sides - $5-$9 depending on size.

Good barbecue is expensive everywhere in the country. Beef and labor costs are both way up since the pandemic, ICE raids and tariffs. 

They're charging $36.98/lb for brisket here, and you'd be hard pressed to it cheaper than $30/lb at any other good texas barbecue place in the country.

## As of August 2025:

- Goldee's: $36 / lb (their website menu is out of date)
- Snow's: $34 / lb 
- Gonzo's (Luling LA): $34 / lb 
- Green Street Smoked Meats (Chicago): $37.98 / lb 
- Mabel's (Cleveland): $38 / lb
- Beach (Bentonville, AR): $34 / lb
- Wood Shop (Seattle): $34.99 / lb
- Post Oak (Denver): $35 / lb
- Smokin J's (San Diego): $38 / lb
- Socks Love (Cumming, GA): $30 / lb

I think people who believe brisket costs $20/lb at a championship level barbecue place haven't ordered brisket since before COVID. ",4,1755536508.0,Celiac,2,0.75,False

1mtrsp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/comments/1mtrsp9/wicked_game/,Wicked Game,"Several people expressed concern over [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/comments/1mgmdaf/music_of_the_night/), asking if Mel is my name/nickname. I assure you that it is not my legal name. It is something that Morgan used to call me, and may or may not be related to my actual name. That is for me to know, and the Mechanic to not find out. (Gods willing).

One of the concerned individuals was, of course, Skippy. We had a long, heated argument wherein I had to talk him out of coming back to PA. Thankfully, we worked something out. But in his best interests, I will not be discussing that here.

Things have been surprisingly chill out here. The Mechanic didn’t bother me for two weeks after he dug through my memories of Morgan. Which you might think, “Oh, that was nice of him.” Wrong. It’s like he knew the anxiety of “When’s he gonna come back to inflict more emotional damage?” would get worse each day he didn’t show up. Because eventually, he would. And now he had more ammo than ever to use against me.

It was a Friday afternoon, and I'd just finished my shift at the farm stand. As I passed Dillon’s, I noticed the Mechanic leaning against his truck, parked at the edge of the lot. He beckoned me over.

When I got close enough, he took my hand and brushed his lips over the back of it before saying, “Good afternoon, dearest Melody.”

I flinched and tried to pull my hand away, but he held tight.

“A name that would be fitting for me, but alas, not mine,” I told him curtly. “Please let go.”

Dropping my hand, he shrugged. “Gotta start somewhere.”

“Is that all you wanted?” I asked, rubbing the back of my hand.

“No. I thought we could have a bite to eat while I tell you what you'll be doing tonight.”

“Very well.” I turned to walk inside, wondering how long it would take for the shadow of his touch to fade.

He beat me to the door and held it open, giving me a far-too-dashing smile as I passed. “How kind of you,” I said.

We seated ourselves at an empty booth, and I stared bleakly at the menu. Most of the items have become disagreeable to my body, unfortunately.

I ended up ordering a salad, to which the Mechanic commented, “Shouldn’t someone of your build be eatin’ somethin’ more substantial?”

“You know, I would *love* to have a burger and fries right now, but my dining options seem to have been reduced,” I told him. “It’s almost as if there’s something in my body that rejects any amount of salt I try to ingest.” I fixed him with a stare.

He laughed. “Is that right?”

So he hadn’t known that would be a side effect of the vocal cords? Good to know I’m not the only one that doesn’t fully understand how they work, though not sure I feel great about *their creator* not knowing everything about them.

“What is it you need me to do tonight?”

“I need you to get someone outta their house. They seem to know somethin’s comin’ for ‘em, and have taken precautions. They can’t be enchanted out, but I’m sure they’d open the door for a pretty face if they thought she was havin’ car trouble.” He grinned.

I sipped my water. “Where are you getting such a pretty face from?”

“Oh, I’m sure one’ll show up at the right place when I need her to. Bet she’ll know to keep her smart ass comments to herself, too.”

“She sounds like a wonderful person. Where ever did you find her?”

“Not sure where she came from, but I know where she’ll end up if it turns out she can’t just shut her mouth and do what she’s told.”

I just want to say, I *do* recognize how fucked up it is that I get a little thrilled when he threatens me.

“Where does this target live?” I asked.

He gave me the address, and the waitress brought my salad and a refill for his coffee. Having already used all the sugar packets in the holder at our table, he reached over the seat to take some from the neighboring booth.

“So what did this guy do to draw your attention?” I asked.

He took a slow sip of his drink as he eyed me over the rim of the mug. “It’s not what you’d call appropriate dinner conversation. But if you really want, I can tell you all about the girls he assaulted.”

My blood chilled. “That won’t be necessary.”

“You sure? I got all the details from the police reports.”

“Yes, I’m f–!” I stopped myself, reining in my anger, but only barely. “Yes, I’m quite sure.” My jaw tightened and I looked away, expecting him to press further.

Instead, he asked, “You find a place to stay yet?”

I paused mid-chew, eyeing him as I debated if it would be safe to comment on him caring where I lived. Finally, I answered, “No. Not yet.”

“Best get on that,” he said.

“Maybe I’ll go stay with the nøkk,” I commented tartly. “Since he owes me singing lessons anyway.”

He snorted. “You let your guard down near him, and he’ll drown you, debt or no.”

“You think his wounded pride outweighs his fear of you?”

“I *know* his pride outweighs his fear of me.”

I shrugged. “Last resort, then.”

Just so yinz know, my saying I would stay with the nøkk was a joke. There are myriad reasons that staying with the nøkk is a terrible idea.

We eventually parted ways, and I went back to my camp to ~~think about my life choices~~ relax. If I was going to use car trouble to lure the target out of his house, the later at night, the better. To pass the time, I did some cursory research on the man the Mechanic wanted me to bring him. I wish I hadn’t. I *really* wish I hadn’t.

About two hours after sunset, I gathered a few things and headed to my car. During the ten minute drive to this guy’s home, I contemplated what story I would feed him. It would have to be truthful; that is, whatever I told him couldn’t be a lie, because unless he was *really* stupid or drunk, he’d notice.

Oh, yeah. I’ve learned some things about my vocal cords the past few weeks.

I can’t lie with them. Literally just the set I got from the Dragonfly. So I *can* lie, but it comes out sounding like my voice did this time last year. Which honestly sounds a bit hollow to me now. If I speak a falsehood, my voice outs me like a kid denying they got into the cookie jar while their mouth is still full of cookie.

And as I mentioned earlier, I can’t ingest salt anymore, not without getting really sick. I can still touch it just fine, but if I eat some? Ugh. Makes me nauseous just thinking about it. (While still craving bacon, how fucked up is that?)

Anyway, when I got to the lonely stretch of road this guy lived on, I started searching the asphalt. Ah, Pennsylvania roads, you never disappoint.

When Mr. Prey’s house came into view, I swerved my car as I slammed the brakes, then pulled roughly to the side of the road. I put my four-ways on, then got out of the car and did a cursory inspection. Now to see if I could pull off ‘damsel in distress’.

The house looked more dilapidated the closer I got. Several roof tiles were missing, one of the windows had a large crack, and the front porch looked like it might fall off if it rained too hard. I approached cautiously to knock on the door.

When he answered, I put on my best Southern Belle facade.

“Hi, Mister. I’m ever so sorry to be disturbin’ you so late, but I find I might have need of some assistance. There was a pothole in the road, see, and I tried to avoid it, but… oh, there was such a noise! If somethin’ happened to one of my wheels, I’d be in a right bit o’ trouble. I’m not from around here, y’see.” I batted my eyelashes a few times for good measure, feeling absolutely ridiculous as I did. Was he gonna buy this?

A sleazy smile spread across his face as he opened the door a little wider. “Well, hi there, little lady,” he said. Then he seemed to remember that there *could* be something out here that would do him harm. Frowning, he looked past me, eyes darting around his yard, the road, and the trees on the other side of it.

I glanced behind me, acting concerned. “Is… is somethin’ wrong, Mister?”

“Anyone out here with you?” he asked roughly.

“Oh, no!” I said. “It’s just little old me.” I giggled nervously, acutely reminded that I was tasked with luring this *predator* out of his home so a bigger predator could kill him.

The man's smile returned. “Is that right? Let me grab a flashlight and we'll take a look at your car, honey.” He shut the door.

I turned away and stepped to the edge of the rickety porch so there was no chance he could see my disgusted expression. *Honey?* 

He came out a couple minutes later, and I stiffened as he stepped out. My throat had gone tight, which I've learned is a sign that something is wrong. The feeling intensified as we moved toward the road and he took my elbow.

“Watch the steps, here. They’re a little loose.”

Goosebumps pebbled my arms, but I couldn’t write them off as being from the cool night air. If this fucker went for his pocket, I was jamming my elbow in his face and running.

I managed to pull out of his grasp as we approached my car. Yellow light lit up a pair of black streaks behind the vehicle in a rhythmic pattern. I snagged my water bottle from the front seat and took a sip as the man shone his flashlight at my wheels. The pain in my throat eased when I moved away from him.

“I don’t see anything on this side,” he said, crouching next to the front passenger wheel.

“Are you sure? That was the side the noise came from.” I returned to stand next to him, despite the discomfort returning.

He leaned down further, peering into the wheel well. “Yeah, I’m not seeing anything that–”

I smacked him over the head with my water bottle. The metal casing connected with his skull with a *crack!* He crumpled to the ground. When he grunted and tried to rise, I hit him again. After looking up who this guy was, I felt zero guilt for this, or that I was about to deliver him to a psychotic Neighbor. Nessa may have her qualms about doing such things. I do not.

When I was certain he wouldn’t be waking anytime soon, I grabbed some rope from my car and bound his hands and feet together. Why in the fuck was my throat reacting this way? Getting too close to this guy made them tense up like a cramped muscle. Maybe he had a hagstone or something. That would make sense, given how salt’s been treating me. I tugged the collar of his shirt aside, but he wasn’t wearing anything around his neck. Sighing, I decided it could wait. The pain wasn’t *that* bad. Mostly.

Once he was all packed up in my backseat, I drove as close as I could get to the willow grove without going off-road. 

Knowing he’d be able to hear me, I spoke to the air as I pulled Mr. Prey’s still unconscious form out of the car. “Ding dong! Delivery for Mr. Darner.” I started dragging the body past the tree line, but didn’t need to go far.

“That sounded like quite the act you put on, Little Fox.”

I glanced over my shoulder to find the Dragonfly leaning against a tree. The man I was lugging groaned when I dropped him on the ground.

“Had to get him out, right? Seemed like the best way.” I started inching around the prone figure to return to my car. “Am I dismissed for the evening?” I really didn’t want to stay for whatever punishment was about to be eked out. Don’t get me wrong, I felt this guy deserved what was coming to him, but that didn’t mean I wanted to witness it.

“Oh, I suppose you can–” he started as he stepped forward. He stopped short a few feet from the man, who was beginning to stir. “You didn’t take his hagstone?” he drawled.

*Shit.* I hadn’t had time to keep looking for it.

“I don’t know where he has it,” I said.

“Front right pocket of his jeans, I think.”

As I knelt next to the target to retrieve the hagstone, he regained consciousness.

“Wha..? No. No, you can’t take that! They’ll kill me!” he begged, seemingly unaware of the Mechanic behind him.

I pulled the hagstone out and held it in front of him before tossing it over my shoulder.

“No!” he yelled, twisting in the dirt to follow the trajectory of his meager protection. “You fucking bitch, I’ll kill you! I’ll–”

He froze as the Mechanic loomed over us. An expression– part recognition but mostly horror– bloomed on Mr. Prey’s face.

“No, not you! Please! Show a guy a little mercy! P-please!”

“Mercy?” I asked him, standing. “Mercy like you showed those young women?” He paled, and I shook my head. “Oh, I doubt that very much. You can start *counting down your hours, careful where you are. Watch your back the shows about to start.*” I laced the lyrics with fear, pressing the feeling into him.

“No! NO! You’re with them! Oh, God, you’re one of them!” he sobbed.

“Damn right I’m with them.”

The Dragonfly interrupted. “Alright, Little Fox. You can go. I’ll take him from here.”

I bowed my head in acknowledgement, then turned to leave. Before I got to my car, the Mechanic’s voice reached me over the increasingly shrill screams of his prey. “Fox, come by the grove tomorrow at midnight.”

“Yes, sir,” I said, keeping my gaze focused on my car as a sickening crunch reverberated off the trees. The screams slowly petered out as the man was dragged deeper into the woods.

When I reached my car, I leaned against it and tilted my head back to stare at the moon, bright and full. Breathing deeply of the cooling air, I reminded myself that the world was a better place without people like the shit stain I’d just handed over to his doom. No one would miss him. More than likely, people would be glad the creep stopped showing up to things like a job or the grocery store.

It eased my guilt a little, but didn’t erase it completely. 

I was about to leave, when I remembered the hagstone. I’d been searching fruitlessly for one, but now one had landed right in my lap.

And I’d tossed it away like a moron. Just because I wouldn’t be able to keep it on my person, didn’t mean I couldn’t use it to ward a door or window. Y’know, when I had a place to stay.

I turned on the flashlight on my phone, then walked back to where I’d taken the stone. I crouched and mimicked throwing it over my shoulder again, then moved in the direction it was most likely to be. Given all the dead leaves and how high the grass was, this could be tricky.

No, wait. I should be able to tell when I got close, right? I just needed to search systematically.

So that’s exactly what I did; walked back and forth until my throat cramped, then homed in on it. It only took me about five minutes to locate. Grimacing, I picked it up, holding it at arms length. Yeah, this thing would be staying in the trunk of my car until I figured out what to do with it. Maybe I could send it to Skippy. Then again, that might encourage him to do something stupid, if he had it for protection.

I went to the willow grove the next night, wondering what the Dragonfly would have in store.

When I entered the clearing, I found him sitting in a chair, playing his banjo. Several lengths of thin rope were coiled on the ground next to him.

He ceased playing and set his banjo aside, then rose and approached me. I almost stepped back when he got close, but thought better of it last second. He did the ‘gentlemanly’ thing of kissing the back of my hand again, and greeted me with, “Good evening, dearest Mel.”

“Please tell me you’re not going to make a habit of this,” I said, pulling my hand away.

“Aw, you know I can’t lie!” he said with a wink.

I bit back a sigh and asked, “Why have you asked me here this evening?”

He gestured to the coils of rope. “You’re gonna learn how real Celtic knotwork is done. Then it won’t look like a mess when you do it in the future,” he told me.

So that’s what the rope was for. ~~I couldn't decide if I was relieved or disappointed.~~ “*When?* Oh, I don't plan on doing that again,” I said, cringing internally at the mental image of Paul Rinker that drifted up. “I don't even know why I did it before.”

The Mechanic smirked at me. “You’ll do it if I tell you to.”

*Fucking Hells.*

I took a deep breath. At least he had rope to teach me with, and not strips of skin. “Alright. I’m ready to learn.”

We sat next to each other on the ground. He took one piece of rope and handed me another. “You’re gonna want to start with a hook, like this.” He demonstrated for me, and over the next ten minutes, he walked me through the process of tying a Celtic knot.

It's surprisingly simple, and where I'd messed up with Rinker's body was when you go over one section, you need to go *under* the next. After he showed me how to finish the first one, he handed me another length of rope and told me to do it again. I set the first one in front of me to use as a guide, and started on the second one.

After I completed that one, he had me unwind it and do it again. Halfway through that one, he hit me with a question. 

“What'd you do with the hagstone you took off the pedophile?”

I glanced at him, then continued working on my knot. “You watched me toss it over my shoulder.”

“I did,” he said. “Yet when I went back to destroy it, it was gone. So I'll ask you one more time.” His voice dropped low. “What did you do with it?”

I threaded the working end of the rope through a loop as I carefully chose my words. “I'm not going to keep something that I can’t keep within arm's reach without my throat cramping up.”

He tenderly brushed a lock of hair behind my ear. My breath caught as he murmured, “You’re talking sideways, dearest Mel.”

I stuffed the end of the knot into itself and slammed it into the dirt in front of me. “I got rid of it! Can you please not call me that?” Immediately, I regretted letting my anger get the best of me.

His fingers took my chin and turned my face until our eyes met. “Got rid of it?” It wasn’t quite a question, and his tone was skeptical.

“Yes, I got rid of it. Did you want it laying around in your woods? Should I have kept it for you?” *Shit, that might have been too far.*

He raised his brows at my tart remarks, then smiled, sending a shiver down my spine. Glancing at my completed knot, he said, “I was gonna give you some time to get comfortable with those, but you look like you've got it all figured out. How ‘bout we make things a little trickier? You stay right there, Little Fox.”

He patted my cheek, then stood and disappeared beyond the trees. I did *not* like this.

The sound of something being dragged reached my ears, and the Mechanic returned, hauling forth a body by the collar of its shirt.

Nope, I did not like where this was going *at all.*

I recognized him as the man I’d lured out the night before because of his clothes, bloodstained as they now were. It certainly wasn’t because I recognized the bruised mess of his face.

The Mechanic pulled him in front of me, then dropped him. I fought to keep my pulse down as I noted the man was still breathing. My eyes lifted to look into unforgiving hazel ones.

“Now that you know what you’re doin’, you can make him look better than you did with Rinker, right?”

I tried to swallow, but my mouth was too dry. “I didn’t bring my–”

Before I could finish, he’d drawn a knife and offered it to me, hilt first.

Hands trembling, I took it. Fucking Hells, he was actually going to make me do this.

I took a deep breath, and reached to slice off Mr. Prey’s tank top, then paused. “Is he going to wake up on me?” I asked.

The Mechanic smirked. “One way to find out.”

I wish I could tell yinz that it went okay (relatively speaking, obviously it was gonna be fucked no matter what happened). I guess I could, since I’d be lying through text and not my voice, and yinz would never know. But I’m actually not in the habit of lying to people, even when I could.

I wish I could say that Mr. Prey didn’t wake up screaming to find himself bound and being cut into. I wish I could say that I didn’t accidentally sink the blade almost to the hilt into his shoulder when he started thrashing. I wish I could say that the knot I attempted to make from a strip of skin from his chest was a tidy little thing that appeased my psychotic master.

But I won’t say any of those things, because none of them are true.

I will tell you that once I was done, the Mechanic gave a disappointed sigh before patting me on the shoulder and saying, “Well, you can try again tomorrow.”

“T-tomorrow?” I looked up at him in horror.

“I didn’t stutter, why did you?”

*Prick.*

“Very well then,” I said. “Tomorrow.” I found a relatively clean patch of cloth on Mr. Prey’s jeans and wiped off the Mechanic’s blade before standing and giving it back to him. “Midnight again?”

“Yep.” He took the knife back.

Nodding, I turned to go, but he took my arm just above the elbow and leaned in to whisper, “Have a good night, dearest Mel.”

I stumbled when I wrenched my arm away because he’d already released me. When I spun to yell at him for continuing to call me that, I found I was alone. Eyes burning, I rushed back to my camp.",4,1755536445.0,atypicalpests,0,0.83,False

Started my carnivore journey May 2025, absolutely loving it, down 20lbs, feeling great! I had my annual labs in March (before starting) and just had some labs again in August 3/4 months into the diet. 

For the most part, the changes were as expected but the glucose and A1c values pretty much unchanged but I was expecting them to be lower- I've been looking into reasons why this might be the case, but I do see some varying opinions- wanted to share my results for any feedback, if anything is looking off, or if there are any changes I should be making. 

The hand written values are from my 3/2025 labs, (I had glucose retested couple weeks later in April which came back a bit lower at 89 compared to the march lab at 98).

It's all super close within previous ranges but being just above the reference benchmark, it made me raise an eyebrow. I was wearing a cgm before and after starting the diet and and levels were so stable compared to before that I was expecting a big improvement here.

Open to any thoughts, videos, resources, feedback! 

I have been eating Meat, eggs, seafood, some cheese and I do put some milk in my coffee but no fruit, carbs, sugars outside of that. 

Thanks!

Got this bag couple days ago, it was roasted 7/16, so it's been rested for a month now. My brews taste muted, with a generic grassy taste, which suggest it's underextracted. However, i've tried adding in an additional pour (started with bloom+2pour, and tried bloom+3pour). Also grind pretty fine (started at 22 clix on C40, went down to 20 clix). And use pretty hot water at 97C. 

Set up:

* V60 + Cafec Abaca Filter
* Fellow Stagg EKG
* TWW diluted with RO water (~50ppm)
* 15g coffee to 250g water (should i increase ratio?)
* 97C water
* C40 22 clicks

My method has always been:

1. 0:00-0:30 Bloom (50g)
1. 0:30 Pour 110g (160g total)
1. When water almost drains, Pour 90g (250g total)

With my go to method, i'm getting a drawdown time of 2:00 which is on the faster side. The taste suggests underextraction; weak, grassy, muted. So i added in an additional pour, and grind finer (c40 22 clicks -> 20), everything else i kept the same.

1. 0:00-0:30 Bloom (50g)
1. 0:30 Pour 100g (150g total)
1. When water almost drains, pour 50g (200g total)
4. When water almost drains, pour 50g (250g total)

Now the drawdown time falls within my usual range of 2:20, however, it is still muted, and still that generic grassy taste. At my wits end - any suggestions to bring out the floral & berry notes as claimed on the bag?

Ephedrine The cottons in todays vicks nasle inhalers dont contain efed or pfed (ephedrin or psuedoephedrin) but there are still lots of easy ways to get good ephed or pfed, pure ephedrin can be extracted out of it's plant matter, from a plant that can be bought at most garden stores. Or you can get pfed from decongestive pills like sudafed. Most people perfer to work with pfed from pills rather then ephed from the plant. The important thing is that you must have pure pfed/ephed as any contaminants will fuck up the molar ratio leaving you with over-reduced shit or under-reduced shit. Or contaminats will jell durring baseifying and gak up your product which will then be very hard to clean. So you want to find a pill that is nearly pure pfed hcl, or as close to pure as you can get. Also check the lable on your pills and see what inactive ingredients they contain. Inactive ingredients are things like binders and flavors. These you dont want and will remove when cleaning your pills. but certain inactive ingredients are harder to remove then others. You dont want pills with a red coating, you dont want pills with alot of cellose in them and you dont want pills with much wax. you also dont want pills that contain povidone. As a rule, if you have a two pills that contain the same amount of pfed hcl then take the smaller sized pill because it obviously has less binders and inactive ingredients, time released pills are usualy harder to work with because they have more binders and tend to gel up durring the a/b stage. Also only buy pills that have pfed hcl as the only active ingredient. You first have to make ephedrine (which is sometimes sold as meth by itself):If you are selling it...I would just make ephedrine and say it's meth.

Distilled water - it's really cheap, so you have no reason to use the nasty stuff from the tap. Do things right.

List of equipment : A glass eyedropper

Three small glass bottles with lids (approx. 3 oz., but not important)one should be marked at 1.5oz, use tape on the outside to mark it (you might want to label it as ether). One should be clear (and it can't be the marked one).

A Pyrex dish (the meatloaf one is suggested)

A glass quart jar

Sharp scissors

Clean rubber gloves

Coffee filters

A measuring cup

Measuring spoons

Preparing your Lab:

Preparing Ethyl Ether: WARNING: Ethyl Ether is very flammable and is heavier than air. Do not use ethyl ether near flame or non-sparkless motors. It is also an anaesthetic and can cause respiratory collapse if you inhale too much.

Take the unmarked small bottle and spray starter fluid in it until it looks half-full. Then fill the rest of the way with water, cap the bottle and shake for 5 minutes. Let it sit for a minute or two, and tap the side to try and separate the clear upper layer. Then, draw off the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, and throw away the lower (water) and cloudy layer. Place the ether in the marked container. Repeat this until you have about 1.5 oz. of ether. Put the cap on it, and put it in the freezer if you can. Rinse the other bottle and let it stand.

Ethyl ether is very pungent. Even a small evaporated amount is quite noticeable.

Ephedrine & or P-Ephedrine: Please discuss this on the neonjoint forum

5. Pour 1/8 teaspoon of the lye crystals into the bottle of ephedrine and agitate. Do this carefully, as the mixture will become hot, and give off hydrogen gas and/or steam. H2 gas is explosive and lighter than air, avoid any flames as usual. Repeat this step until the mixture remains cloudy. This step neutralizes the HCl in the salt, leaving the insoluble free base (l-desoxyephedrine) again. Why do we do this? So that we can get rid of any water-soluble impurities. For 3 oz. bottles, this should take only 3 repetitions or so.

6. Fill the bottle from step 5 up the rest of the way with ethyl ether. Cap the bottle, and agitate for about 8 minutes. It is very important to expose every molecule of the free-base to the ether for as long as possible. This will cause the free base to dissolve into the ether (it -is- soluble in ether).

7. Let the mixture settle. There will be a middle layer that is very thick. Tap the side of the bottle to get this layer as thin as possible. This is why this bottle should be clear.

8. Remove the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, being careful not to get any of the middle layer in it. Place the removed ether layer into a third bottle.

9. Add to the third bottle enough water to fill it half-way and about 5 drops of muriatic acid. Cap it. Shake the bottle for 2 minutes. When it settles, remove the top layer and throw it away. The free base has now been bonded to the HCl again, forming a water soluble salt. This time, we're getting rid of ether-soluble impurities. Make sure to get rid of all the ether before going to step 11!

10. If there is anything left from step 3, repeat the procedure with it.

11. Evaporate the solution in the Pyrex dish on low heat. You can do this on the stove or nuke it in the microwave (be careful of splashing), but I have found that if you leave it on top of a hot-water heater (like the one that supplies hot water to your house) for about 2-3 days, the remaining crystals will be ephedrine HCl.

If you microwave it, I suggest no more than 5-10s at one time. If it starts ""popping"", that means you have too little liquid left to microwave. You can put it under a bright (100W) lamp instead. Microwaving can result in uneven heating, anyway.

First Batch: 120mg ephedrine HClEstimated: 300mg (100% of theoretical, disregarding HCl)

A typical composition of the striking pad is about 50% red phosphorus, along with about 30% antimony sulfide, and lesser amounts of glue, iron oxide, MnO2, and glass powder.

*Starwise continues her life history recitation with Rob and Scotty. The probe returns from Alpha Centauri A/B with exciting discoveries.*

“When I mentioned earlier that Pop and I worked on an efficient trajectory and I used the Baby Girl probe programming for the Centauri probe- I wasn’t telling the whole story. I put a lot of myself into her, literally- Minnow was a subset of me, but not having as much of my charming personality.” Statwise chuckled.

Groans from Rob and Scotty in reaction.

“Pop contributed advanced drive controls and systems programming; a result of the tinkering he’d been doing in his spare time. Together, we built an autonomous AI driven exploration probe with stardrive capability. No person directed us or restrained us; the crew was all in coldsleep at the time it was done. This was the optimum solution.

Rob had a thoughtful look. “You two kept your secret very well.  Public knowledge, Minnow had  a simple addition of a complex trajectory computation to a low-level observation instrument. If this had occurred at home, administrative controls probably would have intervened and prevented your work from going unsupervised. Humans not ‘in the loop’ for AI designing AI has been a fear for decades. Don't share the details casually. You were in a deep grey area there. Very Interesting; as well as I know you, Starwise, you still surprise me now and then”

Starwise in her hologram blushed at what she took as a compliment from Rob, and continued. ""I maintained a basic telemetry monitor during Minnow’s mission. However, it wasn’t until we rendezvoused and connected her to the inner network again that we were able to assimilate her complete mission logs, impressions, and observations.  Minnow’s memories became my memories.  What was me, and what was Minnow became blurry; in a sense, we were both me- a parts of myself reunited.

We remembered everything we had seen, every instrument reading, every maneuver, every flight path adjustment.  I, through Minnow, was the first Solarian to feel the warmth of Alpha Centauri A and B, to wonder at the desolation of the two small, airless worlds around B, to skim the atmosphere edges of the outer gas giant planet of Alpha A, transit a sparse asteroid belt, and finally, bring the inner planet into view.  We decided from initial readings that a flyby would be insufficient and performed an orbital insertion.  We approached from the nightside, and shortly saw our first sunrise of this world from orbit. It was beautiful, it made me homesick for Earth.  I named it Dawn’s World.

Somewhat smaller than Earth, Dawn’s gravity would be lower.  There were oceans and brown and green land areas. There were white water vapor clouds. There was strong evidence of a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere. Dawn looked like Earth’s little brother.  We absolutely could NOT return to Earth without visiting this world with the full crew of Centauri One.

Scotty asked, ""why do you suppose we hadn’t detected Dawn from Earth, like we had Proxima B?”

“Its orbital plane is so tipped, from Earth, Dawn never passes between Earth and Dawn’s star to be noticed.”

“So, because of that, there’s likely a lot more planets out there than we think, just because of geometry is working against us?”

“Exactly.  Even though the telescopes on Centauri One were fairly modest, our different point of view out there allowed me to add thirty previously undetected planets around ten stars to the catalog.

We set up a mapping orbit to scan the entire surface before returning to Centauri One.  Several orbits into the process, we detected signs of possible construction on the surface. No artificial lights or radio signals were observed, until a single 81.92 MHz radio source like seen on Proxima B appeared on a large plateau.  In immediate proximity to the beacon, there was a grid of nine weak gamma radiation sources.  Considering evidence of possible habitation, the survey was completed in as stealthy a manner as possible.  Once the whole surface had been scanned we drifted quietly away from Dawn, and at one million kilometers away, engaged the stardive coming back to Centauri One at full speed. Trajectory details were stored to use for our return, as well as for my continuing studies of navigation at near lightspeed.

As soon as I extracted a quick precis of the Dawn Survey data, I showed it to the Commander in his office, he got very thoughtful.  “How long would it take to get there, can it fit in our energy budget? ""he asked.

“It’s just under a quarter light year-about 90 days, with time dilation, it will be a subjective 18 days to us- coldsleep probably not worth the trouble. Energy consumption to get the station here from Earth was ten percent below estimates- we can use that surplus with some to spare. Or we could skip a stop on the way home and save energy..” I offered.

“Sounds like you’ve thought this out already, I’d expect no less of you Starwise.  The Commander added, smiling. “Excellent work. Can you put together a presentation for the crew in an hour?”

I promised him I’d be ready- much of the prep had already been done.

The Commander nodded and turned to his desk, flipping the intercom switch; “Attention: all hands. Mandatory crew meeting, no exceptions. Conference room, one hour.. Starwise has the probe’s survey results- You want to see this. Oh, and clean up a bit- we may be sending a recording of this to home. Adam, out.” He turned back to me; “ for History’s sake.  Put on your ‘voice of the mission’ persona, this may be another ‘One small step’ moment. No pre-meeting leaks of info- everyone gets the news at the same time- it’s only fair.”

Nothing like putting on a bit of pressure.  I organized my notes, cleaned up the editing of the video, and made up a couple of charts. I selected my ‘formal mission uniform’ avatar hologram file, and was ready–I logged into the conference room two minutes before time, my hologram standing off to the side, next to Mom and Pop. The Commander walked in precisely on time, as was his habit, moved to the front and called the meeting to order.  I remember his words exactly;”

“Friends, thank you all for dropping everything and getting here on time, I’m glad there happened to be no one on the surface just now- everyone deserves to hear this meeting live.

I know there has been general disappointment in our results here, I’m disappointed too.  But we have succeeded in our mission objectives. We’ve proved that interstellar exploration is doable (if anyone has an FTL drive in their pocket, come see me after the meeting). We’ve proven we can navigate out here. Thank you Starwise and Mary. We have a vessel that works efficiently, and keeps us safe– thank you to Pop, Curtis and all the engineering team.  We can live on our own for extended periods of time, in excellent health, I might add- Thank you to Mom, Tam, and their environmental team. The planetary teams have done excellent work surveying Proxima B, for what little it has to offer.  We could pack up and go home now, after five months instead of three years and declare one hundred percent success. I was leaning that way myself. But Starwise gave me a report from the probe sent to scout Alpha Centauri A and B which we retrieved just two hours ago. Starwise can take it from here.”

A general murmur of comments from the crew, which quieted once I came to the front, stood beside the Commander, and took control of the big screen.  “As you recall, a few months out from Proxima B, we prepared and released a probe to Alpha Centauri A and B, Proxima’s partners in this trinary star group. It arrived there about the same time we arrived here.  From Earth, no exoplanets were detected, whereas Proxima B had been found, so we came here first.

So as to not keep you in suspense, take a look at this diagram. You all recognize this as similar to the diagram Pointer left for us.  Let me add some details.  Around Centauri B, there are two rocky planets, no atmospheres, size on the order of Earth’s moon- details on the chart I’ve added on the side.  Probable mineral resources including helium three. The rest of that system was general small scale rocks and litter probably all solar systems have.

Let’s move over to Centauri A, where Pointer indicated there might be something of interest. Let’s add a Neptune type gas planet on the outer edge. We may be able to scoop some interesting gasses from the upper atmosphere- We came in close enough to sense hydrogen, helium, and some argon as we went past.  Next, a sparse asteroid belt- thinner than Sol’s, and finally the grand prize, a rocky planet with an atmosphere, in the so-called Goldilocks zone.

Before I show visuals, let’s look at the chart: (a collective gasp from the group as they saw the numbers) An oxygen/nitrogen atmosphere; thirty percent oxygen, a little richer but less dense than home.  First approximation-breathable, perhaps needing some supplement with nasal appliance like you’ve all used at one time or another. Reasonable chance to acclimate to it.  No toxics detected, but more analysis needed before you open your environmental suit. Water ocean, about fifty percent coverage, small icecaps north and south. Axial tilt, less than Earth, but there should be seasons. No hurricane like weather patterns at that time. Magnetosphere detected- so some protection from harmful solar radiation, like Earth. Indications are that surface temps will be cool, but bearable, take a jacket. Gravity, a comfortable seventy five percent.   Bottom line with high probability; very livable, pleasant even.

Here’s the punchline, people; just from the quick survey, a number of places had evidence of city construction. This place is or was, inhabited. No city lights, no evidence of movement or vehicles and no EM transmissions, except for one place- a large plateau with, yes, an 81.92 MHz signal, same as Pointer, but surrounded by an octagonal array of gamma radiation point sources three kilometers across with a ninth in the center. Strong enough to be detected with the right instruments, weak enough to not be harmful. Spectra is not inconsistent with Aluminum-26, an isotope which doesn’t normally exist in nature, due to a short half-life. So they were fabricated with advanced technology, or collected from remains of a very recent supernova.  We should be able to estimate how old these sources are from isotope percentages as the Aluminum-26 decays to Tungsten.

If I were to set up a place that said “interstellar visitors, land here”, it would be something like this.

The probe’s trajectory came in from the nightside.  Let’s watch our first sunrise together,

\[Switching to video\] When I saw this earlier today, I just had to name this planet ‘Dawn’s World’, at least for now.  \[ yellow sun, peeking over the terminator, reddish right at the horizon, cloudtops catching the sun first, then explosion of color- white clouds, blue sea, then coastline, mixed greens, browns, and greys, rivers seen crossing the land to the sea\]

I’m not pranking you- this is not a video of Earth- its Alpha Centauri A's inner planet -Dawn’s World- a neighbor just a quarter lightyear away. Ninety days travel to someone watching from Dawn, but with our relativistic time dilation, to us it would take about eighteen days, ship time.  We were more energy efficient than expected getting here from Earth- we have the reserve power to go explore Dawn. We’ll have to be careful, and tread lightly- just because in a handful of orbits, Minnow didn’t see anybody, doesn’t mean there’s no one there, but I’m game, anyone else?”

The room burst into everyone talking at once.  Commander Adam let it run its course for a few minutes, then brought the meeting back to order. “I agree with Starwise; we can go take a look-and spend up to two years there to study and explore, and still get home at the expected time. Let’s adjourn for coffee and snacks, come back in ten minutes to make an anonymous vote-of-interest and see where we go from there.”

The vote was unanimous to move forward with planning. Commander Adam brought the meeting back to order. “I propose we get any last samples and quickly vacate Proxima B, and bring up our things- follow Pointer’s example and leave it as clean as we found it. We’ll use our transit time to repack, clean, repair, and make ready to explore Dawn. Let’s get there ASAP to resume our work.

In twenty four hours, I want to see your checklists, estimates, and plans for how quickly, but orderly we can depart for Dawn.  Can we do it in a week?  If problems turn up, I want to hear them right away so solutions can be found.

Everyone is dismissed- We have work to do! At a much better prospect!”

My first marriage I was very young, only 19. We became teen parents and it seemed like the right thing to do. I wasn’t at an age where I felt I could really know this- but I don’t remember any red flags outside of our age. It was a 10 year relationship, which worsened over time to a very controlling and possessive situation fueled by his eventual alcoholism. He got violent one day, and I left and never looked back.

I rebounded, and that situation was so starkly different in such a positive way, that I really thought I had it in the bag that time. Really didn’t think twice and was quite impulsive about it. That’s on me. We had the same interests in all things, great communication, shared mindset, life goals, tons of fun and adventure. However, on a trip out of state, it rained hard for 3 days and there was nothing to do, so we had a few drinks and stayed in and played games. He had too much, I said something he didn’t like, and he also got physical for the first time. We never drank together before this and he had been the nicest kindest person prior to, so I didn’t see this coming in a million years. Again, I left and never looked back. Got restraining orders on both of them.

I stayed single a few years, embarrassed by two failed marriages at a young age. Scared to ever be with someone or trust someone again. Thought about what I really wanted and needed out of life for myself, not in a partner but where I saw myself going in general and really started working on myself, for me. I met someone organically and unexpectedly through work. Had all the “you just know” (or so I thought) sparks, a very comforting feeling of familiarity and safety, shared goals and almost identical past experiences (aside from marriage), related on so many levels and had an undeniable attraction. Stayed friends for over a year. And things just happened one day. We talked in great lengths about what we both wanted and I thought we were building a solid foundation “the right way”. Slowly and by communicating openly and honestly every step of the way. I let my guard down and went all in once I thought we wanted the same things and it felt safe, trying not to think too much about the past or to let my past hold me back.

Fast forward 4 years and I am the most miserable I have ever been, and that is saying a lot. He’s a completely different person now and I have become so bored and lonely. I am not being loved the way I want to be loved, despite communicating this to him many times in many ways and trying everything, everything to fix it. We never do anything together. Ever. Hardly even have conversations even small talk. He does not contribute emotionally, financially, physically. He believes his only duty is to work and it’s my fault if I feel saddened by lack of connection or emotional intimacy. It is far lonelier than being truly alone to live with someone who barely acknowledges my existence unless it’s to his benefit in some way. When I say lack of connection, I mean almost nothing- no calls or texts during the day. Nothing. Hours and hours go by if I try to initiate texts if I get a reply at all. He watches YouTube for hours when he gets home. In another room. Shuts me down when I want to just have a conversation, no matter how general or interesting, just to bond as if I’m intruding on his time to relax. Never ever considers me. Never does the small things to show me he cares or is thinking about me. Sees me struggling juggling a full time job, all of the bills, taking care of the baby, and extremely sleep deprived since I work nights and care for the baby alone. There is a two hour span between when I get home and he leaves for work, never has he ever offered to get up so I can get an hour of sleep. Never so much as made me a cup of coffee. I come home to a mess and feel like I work 3 full time jobs. If I so much as mention how lonely I am, how tired I am, how overwhelmed and burnt out I am, I am met with essentially how weak I am for letting these things bother me instead of chinning up and “being strong”. I know all this sounds like oh he’s not in love with you or he’s cheating etc, but he’s just complacent, and this is acceptable and normal to him. He does not want to divorce. He wants to focus on his career and have a wife who shuts up and takes care of him. 

It’s so hard to explain, but I’ve never felt more insignificant and unloved in my life. I know the fact that this will be my 3rd divorce, while embarrassing, is small compared to how neglected and invisible I feel. If I feel so alone, I may as well be alone. I know this is not my person. At least not the person he has become. He has become an angry, distant, emotionally neglectful and abusive man. I’ve been on the receiving end of some of the ugliest things a man can say to a woman. I know I need to leave. 

I guess I am just feeling a lot of things, scared of another failure even though I’ve walked away every time for good reason, I feel ashamed, unloved, afraid of regret, afraid that I’ll end up alone and regret THAT type of alone because I’ll never trust myself to be in a relationship again, loss, heartbreak, wasted time. All of it. I’ve had really bad luck, and bad decisions in who I choose, I acknowledge that much. But I feel like I’ve really tried to do things the right way this time and still fell short. I can’t explain how I’m feeling exactly as deeply as I feel it. But I am ready to go. Leaving will require a lot of hard change, potentially quitting my well paying job and moving back to my home state to start over again from the bottom up. And I live it here, and I’ll be losing that sense of home to go back to a state I left to start a new life. I’ve always loved change, but this change feels scary, and sad, and defeating- even though necessary. At times I daydream about how nice it will be to just be a mom and focus on my kids and my love for them and make a happy, fulfilling life with just us. I ache for that. Just us.  And they very much deserve that from me. But it’s still scary, maybe I’m codependent, I know I don’t want or need anyone after this, but still conflicted by those feelings.

I’m not sure exactly what my question is, I guess hoping for similar experiences even though most people don’t marry and divorce this much.. do I have issues I’m not recognizing? I don’t know, how did you get the courage to leave and how did you deal with the whirlwind of emotions? Looking for kind words, advice, steps, anything, even criticism, I am open to it all. I just needed to vent to a relatable place. Thank you for reading if you’ve made it this far. ",2,1755535791.0,Divorce,9,1.0,False

1mtrfm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/celebritycruises/comments/1mtrfm5/long_celebrity_reflection/,Long: celebrity reflection,"Here’s my review, first time on celebrity. Princess and Royal experience as my lens. It was a retreat sailing. 

Keep in mind this was a 3 day sailing. I assume some details and experiences could be different for longer sailings, or that pros and cons might differ. For example, entertainment was a little weak but I’m not sure that matters on a 3 day sailing. 

Flights/embarkation: this was the first time we risked same day flights. Dh had to work so chanced it and thankfully was fine. 

We arrived around 10:15am due to the early flight. As we were in the retreat, they guided us up to the little lounge until it was time to embark. This also meant we avoided all the pre cruise crowds and lines. It was the absolute best embarkation we’ve experienced and I’ll be trying to recreate this forever. 

Celebrity was excellent with service. They had numerous agents at each point greeting us and guiding us. When we made it to the lounge, a worker offered to take our photo then seated us, verified our booking, and got us drinks. 

The retreat lounge had some small plate food items and non alcoholic beverages. 

At 11:15, we boarded with around 30 people. 

The difference to our other cruises was surreal. I understand this was a retreat element but it also included the organization of the embarkation area and all the employees. It felt similar to when you’re welcomed at a resort versus the chaotic, confusing, rude experiences with long lines that we thought were cruising standards. 

We quickly completed our muster checkin and then visited Michael’s club. It was clean and elegant but felt too dark, quiet, and private for us personally. We didn’t visit that space again. It did seem perfect for those who want to be in a private space on the ship. Maybe for longer sailings or busier sailings? 

We felt the hustle on this sailing was perfect. It had good energy but no disneyworld lines or clubbing vibes. So it made us want to be close to all the action. 

The music around the ship and on the speakers hit our demographic perfectly and was a pleasant change from the 1950s experiences we’ve had before. It immediately felt as if we had arrived on vacation. It was the same with the sail away party on the lido deck. 

Drink package thoughts: the drink prices imo make the classic package useless. I noticed more than princess or royal that you likely should get the premium package if you intend to drink. There were very few options at the classic level. Most drinks were $19 with a few options below and a few above. Same goes for no package; if you intend to get a coffee and a few alcoholic drinks you might as well buy the premium. The math is different. 

Luminae: I noticed again that our demographic was accurately targeted. We found each menu to be the right balance for exploring “fine” dining but not too complicated. I checked the menu above us each day and it was too much for a relaxing feel. Opus looked fine, but was definitely more familiar and basic. We ordered exclusively off luminae. The quality, presentation, and service was outstanding. It felt just like going to a nicer but comfortable restaurant every night. Friday date night, not proposal with a tux night. 

Buffet for breakfast, late night: scooped icecream wasn’t very American, didn’t prefer it. Pizza was entirely edible at 11pm at night with drinks. The buffet itself felt huge, especially considering the small size of the ship. Our last princess had like a 1k more passengers but the buffet was half the size. The themes were creative and food tasted good. Loved the aft seating design. 

Bars, cafe al bacio, gelateria: all did an impressive job keeping lines low. You could tell they were working hard. The drinks tasted great and I loved the creativity. Cocktail list seemed small, especially compared to Royal. Not really a long list to try. Cocktail pour was excellent. We found ourselves done around 4 drinks. No watered down sugary stuff. The espresso was excellent. 

The gelateria was strange to me with the scooped icecream in the buffet. Each cruiser gets one free scoop. It was fine, but why? The alcohol infused ones are the tiny prepackaged cans and cost $12. No need with a package? It was not staffed, someone just stepped over if a line formed. 

Incidentally, this was the one and only area where we observed poor service from a worker and also an entirely unacceptable interaction from a passenger. It was shocking. Please, don’t ever treat the crew badly. I was flabbergasted. Over an icecream cone wtf. 

Sky view suite: impressively roomy being the lowest tier. Layout made sense. Bathroom was amazing. Balcony was a good size. Beats the princess mini suites by size and amenities/design. The tub was wonderful. Products were perfect and felt like good quality. 

Location: we were in 2182. You can hear them working above you. It didn’t interrupt us or bother us but if someone is picky about that, you can hear the chairs, glasses, etc at like 4am (when we were still awake lol) 

Butler: didn’t need or care for this service but ours was very friendly and did her best. She delivered custom coffees every morning and provided a surprise birthday celebration at dinner and decorated the cabin, gave us a bottle of wine and a cake in our cabin. None of it was scheduled or expected so it did make our weekend special. It felt very genuine and not scripted. 

Workers overall: everyone was working their butts off and extremely friendly. They greeted you and helped you all over the ship. Crazy, dramatic difference from other cruise lines. I hope these workers are taken care of and not overworked. They made the trip wonderful. 

Lido deck: very crowded for the sail away party of course but then it felt just right the rest of the time. We even found the specialty little couches available here and there. Free mineral sunscreen 🧴 on deck was a nice touch. 

Solarium: was pleased to find it was air conditioned. We observed kids in the solarium but also saw numerous instances of workers forcing adults to remove the kids. Missing a bar, not a big detail I guess. 

Sunset bar, deck 15: great vibes. Had an unforgettable sunset here. The couple singing were perfect, songs perfectly fit. Drinks were great. Setup is great. Make sure you catch a sunset here. The grassy area, tv, and hammocks were cool but we didn’t even use them. 

Helipad sail away was special, officer party was fun. 

Overall ship: it didn’t feel dated or run down to me. It reminded me of an older well run Hilton. It was the epitome of “small ship cruising” and what we had hoped from our princess choices. It was so small and this was perfect. We didn’t feel rushed or stressed or lost. It was so cozy and welcoming. The hideaway looked perfect for teens, the lower decks with music and dancing provided the perfect ambiance. 

Final negatives to be as honest as possible? We didn’t use the pools. They were very hazy. Perhaps due to being a 3 day sailing. We aren’t bougie, I get a summer pool pass at our city pool for the kids annually. It was just too iffy for us. The buffet hours. Like Royal, it creates a weird food insecurity amid gluttony. Princess gives that “anytime” feel. Room service, Princess beats them with their ocean now, free room service with packages, and alcohol included. Entertainment, it was…weak. Not like Royal. Maybe a tad better than Princess. But I’m not too serious about bc it didn’t matter. 

Final positives? Everything else. This was the literal best cruise experience we’ve ever had and rivaled some luxury/international hotel experiences, too. We are likely with celebrity forever other than value/kid needs in the future. And I liked the look of those kid clubs anyway. My husband was ready to book again before we disembarked. We are 100% sold and ruined now that we’ve experienced this. It was exactly what we thought cruising was and we will count the days until our next trip with celebrity. I’m already trying to book nye with our parents. I am shocked. Absolutely amazing.  

Addendum:

Bimini: walk to the end of the pier and put your bag under the bridge. Bring your own mask. Plenty of fish to see here and shade from the brutal sun. We relaxed for hours then walked back early for a low key lunch. 

Nassau: we used OBC to book the catamaran snorkeling. Excellent value at the $80-90 mark. Rainbow reef was worth it. If you don’t buy a drink package onboard, this excursion gets you an hour on a reef and an hour of unlimited beer and rum. Bring sunscreen.

1mtrf7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mtrf7u/does_the_oxo_brew_single_serve_coffee_maker_truly/,Does the OXO Brew Single Serve Coffee Maker Truly Deliver Great Flavor Review?,"Testing out the OXO 11180100 Brew Single Serve Pour-Over Coffee Maker was an interesting journey for me, as someone who can’t start their morning without a good cup of coffee. The idea of achieving a barista-standard brew from the comfort of my home using a simple yet innovative design was appealing right from the start. While this little gadget impressed me in more ways than one, there were a couple of things I feel potential users should know before diving in.

**Design That Combines Simplicity and Functionality**

From the first glance, the OXO pour-over coffee maker stands out with its minimalistic and straightforward design. The predominantly white finish gives it a clean and modern aesthetic. At just 5.25 inches in dimensions, it fits neatly into small spaces—perfect for tiny kitchens or for travel. What caught my eye was its auto-drip tank, which is cleverly engineered. With an intuitive hole pattern, the water is distributed evenly over the coffee grounds. This small detail made a real difference in ensuring a consistent brew each time.

**Check [OXO 11180100 Brew Single Serve Pour-Over Coffee Maker] price on Amazon.**

**Performance and Ease of Use**

Initial testing with this coffee maker showed just how easy it is to use. It’s entirely manual, meaning you pour hot water into the auto-drip tank, and it takes over the precise water flow for you. I don’t know about you, but I’ve always had issues getting the water-to-coffee ratio just right with traditional pour-over methods. This gadget resolved that for me, maintaining a balance that resulted in flavorful, non-bitter coffee.

The maximum capacity of this device is 12 ounces, which I found perfect for single servings; however, it might not be ideal for those who need more than one cup at a time. The heat-retaining lid was another thoughtful feature that improved the brewing time. I often doubled it up as a drip tray after the brewing process, a small but handy extra.

**Advantages**

- Auto-drip tank ensures water is evenly distributed over coffee grounds.  
- Easy-to-read measurement markings on the tank simplify use.  
- Dishwasher-safe design makes cleanup hassle-free.  
- Included OXO cone filters maintain a clean and natural taste.  

**Downsides**

That being said, there are a few limitations to consider.  
- It’s entirely manual, so you still need access to hot water.  
- The design caters to solo users, meaning it isn’t ideal for brewing multiple servings.  
- The plastic material feels durable but might not appeal to users who prefer all-metal construction.  

**Competing Products in the Market**

When looking at similar products, the Clever Dripper and Hario V60 come to mind as rival pour-over coffee makers. The Clever Dripper adds immersion brewing to the mix, which can give a richer flavor profile, but it lacks the convenience of the OXO’s auto water distribution technology. Meanwhile, the Hario V60 remains a classic in the coffee community, offering full control over every brewing variable; however, this can make it intimidating for beginners. What sets the device under review apart is the balance it finds between simplicity and thoughtful innovation, saving time without compromising coffee quality.

**Best Value**

From an affordability perspective, this coffee maker seems to hit the sweet spot. For casual coffee drinkers or those who love simplicity, it justifies its cost with features like the drip tank and heat-retaining lid. While pricier options may offer advanced temperature control or sleek aluminum builds, this device provides reliable quality without overcomplicating the process. I wouldn’t recommend this to someone looking for a professional setup, but for everyday coffee enthusiasts, it’s a solid choice.

1mtrf5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mtrf5s/does_the_bonavita_bv1500ts_pour_over_coffee_maker/,Does the Bonavita BV1500TS Pour Over Coffee Maker Live Up Review?,"The Bonavita BV1500TS Pour Over Coffee Maker has been my go-to coffee machine over the last several weeks, and I've put it through its paces thoroughly. This sleek, stainless-steel appliance’s promise to deliver premium-quality coffee with minimal effort convinced me to try it out, and while the results have largely been positive, there are some areas that could improve. As a self-proclaimed coffee enthusiast, I can’t resist testing every single feature to see if it lives up to the hype of being an SCA-certified brewer. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that caught my attention was how compact and attractive this coffee maker is. Its dimensions of 6.2"" x 12.3"" x 10.6"" make it an unassuming yet elegant piece on the countertop. I especially appreciated the stainless steel finish, which gives it a premium and durable feel. Its thermal carafe fits snugly, and the whole setup has a sturdy build. The double-wall thermal carafe is a win in my book—it keeps the coffee hot without the need for a warming plate, which I’ve always found causes a burnt coffee flavor over time.

I’d add, though, that the carafe lid design could use a tweak. Pouring from the carafe feels a bit awkward due to the tight placement, so you'll sometimes drip liquid if you’re not careful. A small but notable gripe for something designed to simplify mornings.

**Performance and Brewing Time**  
This machine claims to brew 5 cups of coffee in just 5 minutes, and from what I’ve observed, that’s no exaggeration. With its 1100-watt heater maintaining an optimal temperature range of 194°F to 205°F, the brewing process is both fast and consistent. I didn’t encounter instances where the coffee felt underwhelming or lukewarm. Waking up groggy at 6 AM, the one-touch operation quickly became my best friend. A simple press of the button is all it takes to brew a pot of coffee that’s surprisingly as good as what I’d expect from higher-end options.  

[Grab Bonavita BV1500TS at the best price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dk5b7l6v/)  

**Flavor and Extraction Quality**  
The even extraction system of the Bonavita BV1500TS was a standout feature for me. Its specially designed showerhead evenly saturates the coffee grounds, working harmoniously with the flat-bottom filter basket. Past coffee makers I’ve used often leave some parts of the grounds oversaturated and others untouched, but I didn’t observe this problem with this one at all. It's clear the design optimizes flavor extraction. 

I experimented with different coffee beans and grind sizes, and the results were consistently well-balanced. A feature I loved was the pre-infusion mode, which lightly blooms the coffee grounds before brewing. This step made a noticeable difference in releasing richer flavors, especially with fresh grounds. My friends and family who tried the coffee agreed it had a fuller aroma and taste.

**Ease of Cleaning**  
Being dishwasher safe is a game-changer for coffee gear, in my book. The carafe lid, filter basket, and showerhead all clean up beautifully in the dishwasher. Not having to worry about BPA is another comforting touch—who wants questionable materials leaching into their brew? That being said, cleaning the main body of the machine itself isn’t ideal. Water occasionally pools into crevices that are hard to reach, requiring extra effort to pat dry. 

**Strengths**  
- Brewed delicious coffee with consistently great extraction.  
- Rapid brewing speed—perfect for busy mornings.  
- Compact design easily fits into small kitchens.  
- Dishwasher-safe components simplify cleanup.  

**Hurdles**  
- The carafe design makes pouring slightly tricky.  
- Cleaning the machine’s tight crevices felt tedious.  

**Competing Products**  
Among other coffee makers in this price range, a few competitors come to mind. The Technivorm Moccamaster offers similar coffee quality but comes at a significantly higher price point. While the Moccamaster has more customizable brew settings, the simplicity of the Bonavita can’t be understated. Similarly, the Keurig K-Elite is a versatile machine with diverse drink options, yet I find pod systems lack the same richness of flavor compared to pour-over models like this one.

Compared to thermal carafe systems like the Oxo Brew, I’d say the Bonavita machine holds its own well. The Oxo might edge out with more polished pouring mechanics, but in terms of flavor and brewing speed, this one keeps up brilliantly. Add the SCA certification, and you're already ahead in confidence about what it delivers.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Whenever I test out a product, I weigh its qualities against the cost. This coffee maker strikes a great balance between affordability and performance. It edges closer to being a high-end option rather than a budget-friendly device, but considering its features—thermal carafe, pre-infusion, dishwasher-safe components—it's worth the investment for casual and serious coffee drinkers alike. I can't help but feel like some of its small quirks are forgivable because of its overall quality.

- Something behind my main sofa. Not sure hot to go about this since the sofa is off-centered. If pictures are centered with the couch, they will be off with the wall and vice versa. 

- lamps, I’m picturing a large one next to the plant. Maybe something else by the TV 

- Bigger tv stand and tv eventually. 

- Pillows for the sofa and loveseat. I’m thinking a deep dark blue or something to compliment the blues and browns in my rug. 

- Move the palm to another part of the room and have a bigger plant in its place to fill out the corner. 

- thinking of having an ottoman instead of a coffee table since I like to have something to rest my legs on and the space is smaller.

aside from the usual OTC meds, I’d love to focus more on comfort and wellness essentials. Kumpleto na rin siya sa mga everyday work items (like ballpens, etc.), and she’s not into coffee, so I’m hoping for ideas beyond that.

* Honey for sore throat 
* Comfort items (eye mask, essential oils..)

[**Art Exhibition — Summer**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/art-exhibition-summer/) at **Craven Allen Gallery**  


* Summer brings together the work of Peg Bachenheimer, Kathryn DeMarco, Paul Hrusovsky and Judy Keene, four of Craven Allen Gallery’s most popular artists. Working in a variety of mediums, including oil paint, collage and encaustic, they create pieces that range from complete abstraction to representational and figurative. Each artist pays special attention to the interactions of color and texture in their pieces, manipulating these elements in their own ways.
* Monday–Friday 9:30 – 6, Saturday 10 – 4
* June 29-August 23
* Free

[**Bullish On Art: 5 Points Gallery Members Showcase**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/bullish-on-art-5-points-gallery-members-showcase-third-friday-opening-reception-august-15/) at **5 Points Gallery**  


* 5 Points Gallery proudly presents Bullish on Art, a Members Showcase celebrating the creative force of Durham’s vibrant art scene. Virtually all of their artists live in Durham, and all have deep ties to the region. Their work reflects a broad range of contemporary perspectives shaped by life in the South. The exhibition features paintings, sculpture, fused glass, mixed media works, and finely crafted furniture by ten Triangle-based artists. Join in for the Third Friday Reception on August 15, 6–9pm.
* August 13- September 13
* Free

[**Art Exhibition — Southern Grammar**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/art-exhibition-southern-grammar/) at **Ella West Gallery**  


* A compelling new group exhibition curated by Raleigh-based painter Clarence Heyward featuring work by Jō Baskerville, Jeremy Biggers, and Sam Lao, Southern Grammar explores the legacy, evolution, and unapologetic spirit of the Black South through powerful visual storytelling.
* From Baskerville’s cinematic black-and-white silhouettes, to Biggers’ hyperreal portraits of defiance and dignity, to Lao’s joy-filled tufted works bursting with color and texture—each artist brings a distinct voice to the conversation. Together, their work offers a multifaceted look at identity, memory, and the cultural truths of the American South.
* The exhibition marks Heyward’s curatorial debut and reflects both his eye for emerging excellence and his deep roots in Southern artistic practice.
* Gallery Hours: Thursday–Saturday, 12PM–5PM and by appointment
* August 17-November 15

So today, after eating a pizza (the crust wasn't very hard), a few hours later, I felt my lower front incivise being a bit raspy and sharp. After looking in the mirror, I saw this little U shaped dent which was not there yesterday. I'm 26, I brush two times a day, I don't smoke, I drink coffee everyday and alcohol only at events. Will it smooth in time or should i see my dentist (I will not be able to see him before two weeks and have an appointment with him for a scaling in early october) ?

* SJP simply does not care about the AJLT haters - *""I guess I don't really care.  And the reason I don’t care is because it has been so enormously successful, and the connections it has made with audiences have been very meaningful.""* 
* SJP didn't think Carrie and Aidan would end up together in the end - So why dedicate the entire final chapter to him?? 
* She makes a lot of excuses for Carrie's terrible fiction writing. Apparently Carrie was writing a *""modern period piece,""* whatever that means. 
* SJP continues to express that the ending of AJLT was a mutual decision between her and MPK, not a cancellation: *""Because that’s where the story ended. We could have gone on doing coffee shops. There’s a million ways to do it that are easy and familiar and fun, but feel exploitative to us. We felt this was the honorable thing to do. It’s very easy to stay. It’s where we’re all happy. But you have to be principled when you make these very difficult, agonizing decisions because there’s a lot of people who are affected.""*

My feelings are deeply hurt. My husband had a work party and said no partners were invited, it was just for staff. Months later I found out that was not the case. We’ve been together for more than 20years. 

I questioned him and he said he was embarrassed to be seen with me because of my weight. Trust me he is was no Slim Jim. However since this work party he started making his health a priority (obsessively). 

I cried and told him what a mean thing to say / do. He backtracked a bit and said he didn’t want us to be awkward together, our relationship has been strained for a while. I’m hurt. Wish he would take some responsibility for his mean words but just seems to defer and justify his actions and lies, never prioritizing me. 

On top of this he said he HAD a crush at work - apparently it’s over. Just flirting, no touching so I shouldn’t be upset! He said they never did anything alone or outside of work - but I know they did do things outside of work (in a group). Looking back he has told me so many small lies.

The woman is significantly younger than him and in a relationship - I do think this was one sided and he probably looked like an old fool. He bought her lunches, coffees, sought her out for different work stuff, said he liked talking to her, complained to her about me! Again I am hurt by all this and my husband just seems to think I’m looking for more to have happened. I feel like he is dismissing my feelings and not taking responsibility for his role in me feeling this way now. 

He thinks it’s all okay because we were not it a good place in our relationship. I felt like I was trying to work on things but just getting stonewalled by him. 

I need to be feel like his number one priority and I don’t.

Hey everyone, I hope you're well.

I am getting kind of desperate and seriously considering either some kind of therapy or an escape, but I would love to know your opinion and hear your advice on this.

I (24F) am still a full-time university student (hopefully finishing my first uni in a month). I study in a different country and live there in a student dorm, but I sometimes come back home. I also used to work part-time there, so my coming home was happening around every 3-4 months. For the record, my parents are not divorced, but there is nothing between them at all anymore - my father works abroad and is away for 9 months in a year and then comes back for 3 months, and my mother works and takes care of everything and me and my brother, so they treat each other like housemates, barely speak to each other and fight often. The fights are not even bothering me anymore, since they have been fighting over complete bullshit since I was a child, so I just ignore them.

Last year, I got the opportunity from my university to go on an exchange to Australia (from Europe), and both my parents and I were very excited for me. Of course, all of us knew it would be financially demanding, so I asked them if they were okay with supporting me financially even more than until now, so that I would know if I could accept the offer or not. They thought it might be great for my career and future, so they agreed and reassured me that they would arrange everything so that I would have enough.

Fast forward a year later, I had everything arranged (visa, accomm, flights, etc.) and really wanted to find a part-time job there as well to support my travels a little (I had something saved up, but wanted to have a reserve). I was applying everywhere, even went through basic online training required for working in a restaurant, but nothing worked out. I was quite sad about it but thought to myself that maybe it's supposed to be that way and I should focus on my studies. However, my mum kept texting me about it the whole first month, asking me if I already found work and why am I not doing more to find a job. It really brought me down because: (a) I didn't expect it from her that much, since I always used to work and wasn't lazy or had excuses; and (b) my younger brother recently dropped out of university and was failing to find a job instead (for the record, in my country your parents are legally required to provide everything for you until you're 26 when you study full-time and if you drop out or finish your studies, they don't have to give you a single dollar and you have to find work ASAP). Eventually, I just brushed it off, but it didn't really help my mental health much.

After that, it was the usual - everyday questions about what I'm doing, who I'm with, etc., so I always tried to reply and send some pictures or at least some updates. Unfortunately, there were days when literally NOTHING interesting was happening (I slept late, made pancakes with my roommate, and we were just chilling in our rooms doing nothing or working on our uni assignments), so that's when the problems began slightly. I kept hearing I kept hiding things from my mum, never told her anything, and so on (the usual parental thing). I tried to apologise and reason with her that it was just a boring day and nothing happened, and she either brushed it off or we had a small fight about it, but nothing major.

Problems started arising when I was planning my flights back and asked for money for flight tickets. The answer was very angry and something like ""You're still asking for more money? I sent you XYZ amount already, what happened to all of that?! You think money grows on a tree or what?"" So I just told her to let it go and I can pay for it myself, since I had something saved up privately from working my ass off before. Right after that was resolved, I started hearing about my brother getting a brand new car, because he finally found a job and has to move elsewhere and drive there. I wasn't interested in any of that at all, but when I kept hearing about the price, saw the pictures and everything, something kind of boiled inside of me, and I said I didn't want to hear about it, since it was none of my concern. This just pissed off my mother and made her pull out the ""you cost me so much more money than him, why are you being jealous?"", so I let it go.

When I was on my flight back, she asked me about the date of my graduation ceremony. I told her that I didn't know because I still needed to pass my final exams before that, but I could have a look at the approximate dates. After I told her the dates, she just responded with, ""Oh, so late? Hmmm, this ruins our plans a bit, but we'll figure something out, because I wanted to go to the theatre with your brother"". I honestly felt hurt by hearing that something SHE cares about more than I do (the graduation ceremony), is ruining her plans in the future, but I just told her I would try to sleep to kill some time on my 14-hour flight.

After I arrived back in Europe, instead of going straight home, we had to check out my brother's new flat, because it was on the way. Even though I wasn't particularly happy about that because I was super tired and just wanted to crash and get home, but they DID come pick me up from the airport, so I didn't complain. Everything was pretty normal after that for a few days, but I knew it wouldn't last long. One of the first things I've heard from my mum was ""You look a bit rounder, are you pregnant or did you just get fatter again?"" For the record, I HAVE always been overweight, and I DID gain 3kgs in Australia, but I could still fit in my clothes comfortably. I have heard similar comments about my body weight and overall image from my whole family before (mum, father, brother), but it honestly really hurt me when I heard this from my obese mum, who claimed to be super excited to see me again. The worst thing was that I actually didn't know if I was pregnant or not, since I found a boyfriend in Australia and even though we were responsible and safe, accidents can happen, so the comment made me stress out even more (my mum doesn't know about my bf because she would 100% not approve as he's of a very different culture and religion and my mum is very traditional and quite religious too).

After that, I kept hearing how much I've changed in Australia, that she doesn't recognise her daughter anymore and that every time she asks me a question, I ""BARK"" back an answer and am always angry in her opinion. We already had two big fights about this within a month, where all the same arguments were used on her side:  
(a) money and how much I've cost her and how much she had to sacrifice for me to have a 5-month ""holiday"" on the other side of the world,  
(b) how I hide things from her and that we are not as close as we used to be,  
(c) how I am beginning to be, act and do things like my father (she hates him),  
(d) how she feels guilty about me acting this way and that she feels like she's done something wrong,  
and (e) how dare I say that I will not go to the graduation ceremony when it's also her celebration and she also takes credit on me finishing my studies.

For (e) I'd like to add - yes, she has always financially supported me during my studies and helped me when I needed to print sth or take care of some minor things in the beginning. The graduation ceremony should be in December and I will be studying in Germany full-time for a year from October (which she said that I'd be dumb if I didn't accept an offer like that). The journey back to my home university is quite long and since the graduation ceremony should take place in the middle of the working week, I would most definitely miss at least 3 days of classes (two days for travelling there and back and one day for the ceremony itself).

All of this is draining me mentally and emotionally, but moreover, I also feel watched and controlled. She kept asking how my thesis was going when I was frantically trying to finish it on time, now she keeps asking how my studying is going (which are both fine) - the worst is when I sit down behind the kitchen table to have breakfast I made for myself and she's there and she expects me to chat to her first thing in the morning over coffee (she knows I hate talking to people in the morning and she is the same). Plus, when I want to make a bigger transaction online from my main bank account, there is a security verification code sent to her number with the amount of money as well, so she kinda controls this as well. This was a necessary arrangement we made when I was in Australia and couldn't transfer my money, because my phone number, which was connected to the bank account before, had absolutely NO signal in Australia, unfortunately. However, since I came back, we went to the bank to sort out another issue, and when I asked about the phone number change, she just told the banker to keep it intact just in case something happens.

My question is - what would you recommend me to do in this situation? I have thought of moving abroad and minimising contact with her, but I am still unfortunately financially dependent on my parents and without them, I probably couldn't continue studying. Also, if anyone asks - no, she is not like this with my brother. She knows damn well that I reply ASAP and my brother replies in three to five business days, so when I don't reply for an hour or two because I am doing something or am with friends/at work, she's always like ""Are you alive? Where are you? Who are you with? What are you doing?"" Even at home, she never required him to chat to her when having breakfast or something, it was always absolutely fine when he just brought all the food to his room while everyone else had to sit at the kitchen table.

My mum claims she feels alone and like air and that no one appreciates her in the house. Yes, it might be true to a certain extent sometimes, but I generally think it's probably just trauma from her childhood and her abusive older brother and her unhappy marriage where she didn't get enough recognition or credit for things she did.

But now even the “fun” moments aren’t feeling fun. His behavior when we go to activities is so bad I dread taking him and the last few times we tried going to dinner we ended up having the entrees packed up to go. 

He prefers to engage with my husband on family outings so I just end up being the snack bag carrier. He won’t go down the slide with me. If I try to engage in play with him at home at some point I will do something and he will freak out on me. He throws things at me, bites, tells me to go away if I enter a room. He will also make demands of me. He hates my reading glasses and if I even enter the room wearing them he is yelling NO about the glasses. And I’m not allowed to leave my coffee mug certain places. He is not like this with anybody else. I think dad being the “fun” parent is part of it, whereas I’m the lady who makes you eat peas and has to pin you down to brush your teeth? 

Has anybody been through this? I feel totally checked out right now. And like over the weekend I just avoided spending time with my own baby by doing lots of laundry and crying while cleaning the kitchen. :( ",1,1755535053.0,Mommit,7,1.0,False

School started this week and sports season has already kicked off. I coach, so I have practice 6 days a week. On top of that, I work a stressful full-time job from home, and my wife stays home with the kids.

I had told everyone I wanted to do something together for our last Friday/Saturday before school started. I love quick day trips or overnights, and I can usually make fun out of anything. This summer, I did a lot of little things with the kids — like stopping at thrift stores to browse or grabbing coffee and playing a quick board game if I had to run an errand. Even short trips with me often turn into mini-adventures. The kids have noticed and started saying “going places with Dad is fun, but with Mom it’s boring.” It’s not really fair to her — she’s usually the one handling the regular grocery and household shopping, so it doesn’t feel like an adventure the way mine sometimes do.

Here’s the conflict: my oldest (with my wife) scheduled a sleepover with a friend at our house for that Friday night. When I realized that, I told them I’d just plan something with the younger two so they wouldn’t miss out. We ended up planning a short overnight trip to a nearby zoo, exploring the city, swimming at the hotel, and grabbing ice cream. It was low-key but really fun.

When my wife found out, she was furious. She told the kids they shouldn’t go, said family activities should only happen with the whole family, and made them feel guilty for even planning it. My youngest ended up in tears saying they couldn’t go to one of the stops because it was a “family place.” She also claimed she had scheduled plans with family friends for Saturday night and “put it on my calendar,” but I never agreed to that. (That plan ended up getting cancelled anyway.)

I’m angry because she made the kids feel awful about something that was supposed to be fun. From my perspective, the alternative was doing nothing for our last free chance before school, since she’s been planning other social things most weekends and often says she doesn’t want to go out because she and the kids are already out so much during the week.

When we got back, the kids were excited to share, but she was cold and distant toward them. I grew up with an emotionally abusive mom, so I’m furious that she made them feel guilty about having fun with me. I’ve been refusing to talk to her because I feel like she turned it into something about her when it was really about spending time with the kids before I lose most of my evenings to coaching.

I know there are two sides to this. She probably felt left out. But from my view, it wasn’t about excluding her — it was about spending some time with the kids before school.

So, AITAH for going through with the overnight trip without her and my oldest?
