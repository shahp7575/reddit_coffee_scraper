I would usually use Toki, but I was recently gifted a bottle of Chita from my brother in law so I used that. Probably overkill but it's damn good. There's some other *exotic* ingredients but I assure you it's pretty easy to find Sudachi and Yuzu superjuice online, and the bitters are from Honest John.

.75oz of Japanese Whisky 

.5oz Amaro Nonino

.25oz Sudachi Juice

.25oz Yuzu Juice

.5oz Aperol

.5oz Banana Liqueur (Tempus Fugit)

2 drops of coffee cherry bitters

Shake with ice until chilled, double strain into a frozen coupe glass.

Garnish with your best attempts at an origami crane.

1jen9t5,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jen9t5/i_fell_in_love_with_another_woman_while_dating_my/,I fell in love with another woman. While dating my gf of 3 years.,"         So first let’s add some context. In college I met this girl and I thought she was going to be my wife. We dated all the way through college. She ended up breaking up with me a few months before graduation. It crushed me I was depressed, stuck in my room. Watching paw stats on repeat. But I had to force myself to get out there. So I got on tinder and matched with this girl and we went on a date. Had a lot of fun with her and really enjoyed her company. She was really pretty but honestly polar opposite of what I usually date or my type. But we keep hanging out, it was nice to not be alone and have someone I could hang out with. Next thing weeks turn to months and before I know it we’ve been dating for a year.

         I have met her family, I went to her brother wedding. She’s met my family this has become something really serious before I knew it. She is truly amazing she does so much for me and I do a lot for her. But I knew in the back of mind that this is not what i want. But the truth is I got comfortable and I was having fun. Fast forward another year. We are going strong both working  toward our goals. I love this girl I really do. In that same year I had gotten a new coworker at work. Her and I hit it off immediately we had so much in common music, humor, interest. We had become best friends. This is going to sound hard to believe. But she was engaged when she started working. So I never thought about her romantically. I thought she was attractive but nothing more. But it soon became my favorite thing was going to work because I would get to talk to her.

     Fast forward some more and she has broken off her engagement. Honest to god truth it’s horrible but I was happy when she told me that. I knew this was the type of person I wanted to be with. But she was older than me and I thought out of my league. But as time goes on we become closer and closer. Until eventually after work I get a text from her. We had never communicated outside of work. Ask if we can meet up at a coffee shop to talk. That we do and she tells me she has had feeling for me for a long time and they have only gotten stronger. I told her how I felt about and from that point forward we could not get enough of each-other. This all while I am still dating my gf. Everyday after work we would see each-other. Our conversational chemistry was already amazing but intimately and physically it was next level. We were so in sync that it was like we had always known each-other. We’d talk for hours after work. Never enough of each other. This is what I had been longing for so long.

My coworker and I loved each other. I started changing my future plans so I could be with her. But as things went on our attachment let’s becoming stronger. But what she wanted to do with her life and I wanted to do weren’t going to work. Especially with out age gap so we chose to end it. This one really hurt. My first break up I believe was sad but amplified by it being first. This one killed me she was everything I wanted but we just met in unfortunate times in our lives. It only makes it worse that im still dating my gf. Who loves me unconditionally which makes me feel terrible. But I need to break up with her. Because when I see her all think about is the other girl. But breaking up with her is going to crush her. But I should’ve thought about that before I cheated on her. But yeah I’m a scumbag and I feel terrible. ",1,1742352545.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1jen9o9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jen9o9/politics_obsessed_family/,Politics Obsessed Family,"Alright alright, I need some help with navigating my politics obsessed family. Personally, I lean left and do not express the same values as my family which is generally fine. Honestly, that’s life and you have to mingle and get along with people you disagree with. What I have a problem with is how intensely my family follows extremely slanted, biased news stations religiously. 

Every single day, 24 hours a day, FOX news is playing on a tv. It makes them miserable, I should mention. They always have a reason to be pissed off, without even taking a second to check other news sources and carefully evaluate the information they are intaking. They talk about Trump like he is a family friend, my brother called him ‘an alpha male’ and my mom quite literally said that she wouldn’t care if he did assault women. 

I don’t mean to sound antiquated and outdated, but it makes me cringe. Like I get actual, second hand embarrassment from how they talk about him. More than that, they just constantly run their mouths and want to have political discussions when politics is not a part of the conversation at all.

“Hey, I was thinking about making a pot of coffee. You in?” 

“Yeah, sure. You know, since Trump won America again, immigration is going to be abolished.” 

Okay slight exaggeration, but you get the point. It’s so suffocating, and you have to walk around eggshells on them. Not to mention the cultish right leaning music my brother listens to and sings at the top of his lungs. I just don’t know how to navigate them in the slightest, but they make themselves miserable, so they turn that misery out onto other people and I’m so frustrated. Anyone have any advice?

1jen9kf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1jen9kf/i_work_as_a_babysitter_in_the_night_for_a_creepy/,I work as a Babysitter in the Night for a Creepy Family…There are STRANGE RULES to follow.,"([Narration](https://youtu.be/EyoS9WFTeNE) By Secrets in the smoke)

**Some jobs aren’t worth the money. Some jobs aren’t worth the money.** 

Some jobs take more from you than they give. I learned that the hard way.

At the time, I was desperate—College tuition was draining my bank account faster than I could keep up, and my part-time job barely covered food and rent. Every time I checked my balance, it felt like a punch to the gut. Bills kept piling up, and no matter how many extra shifts I picked up, I was always falling behind. I needed a side job—fast. Something easy, quick, and preferably well-paying. No complicated interviews, no weeks of waiting for a paycheck—just instant cash.

That’s when I stumbled upon the ad.

**""WANTED: Babysitter for one night. Pays $500. Must follow instructions carefully.""**

Five hundred dollars for a single night? That was insane. Too good to be true, really. Babysitting usually paid, what, fifteen bucks an hour at best? My first instinct told me there had to be a catch. Maybe it was a prank. Maybe it was some kind of scam. But then I thought about my empty fridge, my overdue internet bill, and the fact that I had about twenty dollars to my name. I wasn’t in a position to be picky.

Without overthinking it, I grabbed my phone and dialed the number listed in the ad.

The phone barely rang twice before someone picked up. A woman. Her voice was cold, distant—completely void of warmth, like she was reading off a script.

**“Be here by 7 PM sharp. No guests. No phone calls.” She said,**

I opened my mouth to respond, to ask any of the hundred questions running through my mind, but the line went dead before I could get a single word out. No introduction, no small talk, nothing. Just an address and a set of rules.

That should have been my first red flag. Who hires a total stranger without even asking basic questions? No ""Do you have experience?"" No ""Have you worked with kids before?"" Just… instructions. But five hundred bucks for a few hours of babysitting? No way was I passing that up.

I drove to the house and arrived.

The house was massive. Not just big—**mansion** big. It stood at the very end of a long, deserted road, surrounded by nothing but empty land and thick, shadowy trees. No neighbors. No streetlights. Just a cracked, lonely pavement leading up to an eerie, towering house.

A single porch light flickered weakly, barely illuminating the front door. The whole place looked straight out of one of those horror movies I usually avoided. Something about it made me hesitate. The silence. The stillness. The way the windows loomed like dark, empty eyes.

I took a breath, shaking off the creeping unease, and walked up the steps. My knuckles barely brushed against the wood when the door creaked open—like someone had been standing behind it, waiting for me.

A man stood in the doorway. He was tall, painfully thin, with sharp features that made his hollowed-out face look even more severe. Deep, dark circles pooled under his sunken eyes, like he hadn’t slept in weeks. Maybe months. Despite his exhaustion, his suit was crisp, perfectly pressed, not a wrinkle in sight.

Behind him, a woman hovered stiffly, her posture so rigid she looked like she might shatter. Her hands were clasped tightly in front of her, knuckles bone-white, like she was holding onto something for dear life.

The man’s gaze locked onto mine. His voice was flat. Mechanical.

**""You’re the babysitter?""**

I swallowed, my throat suddenly dry. “Yeah.”

The woman stepped forward before I could say anything else and shoved a folded piece of paper into my hand.

**""These are the instructions.""**

I glanced down at it but didn’t open it yet. Something about their urgency made my stomach twist. **“So, um… where’s the kid?”** I asked, forcing a small smile.

Neither of them answered. The woman didn’t even blink. She just turned on her heel, grabbed her coat, and started toward the door.

**""We’ll be back by sunrise,""** she said quickly. **""Follow the rules, and you’ll be fine.""**

And then—before I could ask anything else—they were gone. The door shut behind them with a quiet but firm **click.**

I stood there for a long moment, gripping the piece of paper in my hand, my unease growing by the second. Why had they left so quickly? Why did this whole thing feel… wrong?

Finally, I looked down at the list.

The paper was old, slightly crumpled, and covered in tight, neat handwriting, each letter carefully formed, as if someone had taken painstaking effort to make sure every word was clear. It wasn’t printed, no official babysitting instructions—just a handwritten list. aIt wasn’t rushed or scribbled—it was deliberate. Like whoever wrote it **needed** me to understand.

My eyes skimmed over the rules, my stomach twisting with each one.

**Rule #1 : Put Timmy to bed by 8:30 PM. If he asks for a bedtime story, only read from the green book on his shelf. Do not read any other book aloud.**

Okay… strict, but fine. Maybe it was a sentimental book or something.

**Rule #2 : Lock all doors and windows before 9 PM. If you hear scratching at the back door, do NOT investigate.**

I blinked. What? That was weird. Why would there be scratching? A raccoon? A stray cat?

**Rule #3 : Do not answer the phone after 11 PM.**

My pulse quickened. Why? Who would be calling? And why would I need to ignore it?

**Rule #4 : If Timmy tells you someone is outside his window, do NOT look. Tell him, “Go to sleep, Timmy.” Do not say anything else.**

Okay. No. That was officially creepy.

**Rule #5 : If you hear footsteps upstairs while Timmy is asleep, ignore them. Whatever you do, do NOT go upstairs.**

A lump formed in my throat. Footsteps? But there shouldn’t be anyone else in the house.

**Rule #6 : At 11:33 PM, the kitchen door will open on its own. Do NOT close it. Do not look inside. Let it remain open until 11:42 PM.**

My hands felt clammy. I wiped them on my jeans.

**Rule #7 : If you hear a child giggling from the second floor, ignore it. The boy you are babysitting is asleep.**

I swallowed hard. My eyes darted back to the top of the list, rereading every rule, hoping maybe I had misunderstood something. But the words were still there, clear as day.

**Rule #8 : If you wake up on the couch and don’t remember falling asleep, leave the house immediately. Do not look back.**

I let out a nervous laugh. A dry, humorless sound. This had to be a joke, right? A prank? Maybe the parents were just messing with me—some weird rich people humor I didn’t understand.

Then, I heard a voice.

**“Are you my new babysitter?”**

I jumped, my heart slamming into my ribs as I spun around.

A little boy stood at the bottom of the staircase, staring at me with wide, tired eyes. He couldn’t have been older than six. His blond hair was messy, sticking up in different directions like he’d been tossing and turning in bed. He wore pajamas—soft, blue ones covered in tiny stars.

I forced a smile, trying to steady my breathing. **“Yeah. You must be Timmy.”**

He nodded. **“Did my mom give you the rules?” He asked.**

Something about the way he asked sent a chill up my spine. His tone wasn’t casual or curious. It was serious.

My stomach twisted. **“Uh… yeah.”**

His expression darkened. His small fingers tightened on the banister. **“You have to follow them.”**

I stared at him, unable to respond. His voice was quiet, but there was a weight behind it—something heavy, something that made my skin crawl.

I shook off the unease, forcing myself to focus. It was just a kid. Just a weird set of rules. Nothing was going to happen.

I led Timmy upstairs, my footsteps echoing in the quiet house. His room was small and tidy, with a little twin bed and a row of stuffed animals lined up against the wall. Everything was neatly arranged, like it hadn’t been touched in a while.

As I pulled the blanket over him, he whispered, **“Don’t forget to lock the doors and windows.”**

I nodded quickly, not wanting to show my discomfort. **“I won’t. Get some sleep, okay?”**

He didn’t answer, He studied my face for a moment, like he was trying to decide if he could trust me. Then, finally, just turned over, hugging a stuffed bear to his chest, and he closed his eyes.

As soon as his breathing evened out, I left the room and made my way through the house, double-checking every door, every window. The locks clicked into place, one by one, until I was sure everything was secure.

I had just finished locking the back door when I heard it.

A faint scratching.

I froze.

The sound was soft but deliberate. A slow, dragging scrape, like fingernails running over the wood. My breath caught in my throat.

A cold chill ran down my spine as my eyes flicked toward the paper still clutched in my hand.

Rule #2: **If you hear scratching at the back door, do NOT investigate.**

My throat tightened. Every instinct screamed at me to look—to check, just to make sure it wasn’t, I don’t know, a tree branch or an animal. But something deep inside me **knew** better.

I squeezed my eyes shut, my pulse hammering in my ears. **Just walk away. Ignore it. It’s nothing.**

Slowly, I forced my legs to move, stepping away from the door. The scratching continued behind me, steady and patient, as if whatever was out there **knew** I was listening.

Minutes passed. The scratching continued, slow and rhythmic, until, finally—it stopped.

I let out a shaky breath.

I spent the next hour glued to my phone, scrolling through social media mindlessly, trying to drown out the silence. But the quiet was suffocating. The whole house felt… wrong. Too still, too heavy, like the walls themselves were holding their breath. Every creak, every shift in the floorboards made my heart pound.

I forced myself to check the clock.

Then, at exactly 11 PM, the house phone rang.

I froze.

I jolted so hard my phone nearly slipped from my hands. The old landline sat on the wall near the kitchen. Its shrill, piercing ring shattered the silence, echoing through the dimly lit living room, sharp and unrelenting. My breath hitched.

Rule #3: **Do not answer the phone after 11 PM.**

I turned my head slowly, my gaze landing on the old-fashioned phone sitting on the small table across the room. 

I stared at it, my pulse pounding in my ears. The ringing didn’t stop. It just kept going, over and over, like whoever was on the other end wasn’t going to give up.

The ringing was insistent, demanding. 

Like It knew I was here.

It rang again.

And again.

And again.

I turned my back to it, gripping my phone in my hands, trying to ignore it. Just a few more seconds, and it would stop. 

Each ring made my stomach clench tighter. 

My fingers twitched. My breathing came fast and shallow.

What would happen if I answered? Who would be on the other end?

I squeezed my hands into fists, my nails digging into my palms. **Ignore it. Just ignore it.**

Seconds dragged on like hours. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the ringing cut off.

Silence.

I let out a slow breath, forcing myself to relax.

But just as my shoulders sagged—

**“Miss?”**

My stomach plummeted.

I spun around so fast my vision blurred.

Timmy stood at the bottom of the staircase. His small hands gripped the railing tightly, his knuckles white, his eyes wide with fear. His face was pale, his lower lip trembling. When he spoke again, his voice was barely above a whisper.

**“There’s someone outside my window.”**

My blood ran cold.

**Rule #4** flashed in my mind.

**If Timmy tells you someone is outside his window, do NOT look. Tell him, “Go to sleep, Timmy.” Do not say anything else.**

I swallowed hard, forcing myself to keep my voice steady. **“It’s okay, Timmy. Go to sleep.”**

Timmy didn’t move right away. His small fingers gripped the banister, knuckles turning pale. His lip quivered as he shifted on his feet. **“But… he’s staring at me.”**

A chill spread through my body, icy and slow. My instincts screamed at me to run upstairs, to check, to **look**—but I knew I couldn’t. The rules were clear.

I forced a weak smile, even though my hands were shaking. **“Go to sleep, Timmy.”**

His wide eyes flicked toward the hallway, and for a second, I thought he was going to argue. His little body trembled, a quiet fear radiating from him like static electricity.

But then, slowly, he nodded.

Without another word, he turned and padded back toward his room. He climbed into bed, pulling the covers up to his chin.

Then—Timmy asked suddenly.

**“Are you scared?”** 

My breath caught.

I turned my head slowly, my heart hammering in my ears.

Timmy was still sitting upright in bed. He shouldn’t have been—I had just tucked him in, just watched him lay down. But there he was, sitting silently, watching me.

His pale face seemed even paler under the dim glow of his nightlight. He was small for his age, fragile-looking, with dark circles under his eyes.

I forced out a short, nervous chuckle. **“Of what?”**

Timmy didn’t blink.

**He didn’t answer.**

Instead, in a quiet, almost pleading voice, he whispered: **“Don’t close the kitchen door.”**

A cold, twisting fear coiled in my stomach.

I pressed my lips together and nodded. **“Okay.”**

I left his room and shut the door behind me—firm, but gentle, careful not to make a sound. I could still feel his gaze, burning into my back.

I didn’t check the window. I **couldn’t** check the window.

My legs carried me downstairs on autopilot, though every step felt heavier, harder to take. I tried to shake off the nerves, tried to convince myself this was all in my head.

I was trying to calm the wild pounding in my chest. Just make it through the night.

The rules were just… just **weird rules**, right? The parents were strict. Maybe paranoid. Maybe they had a reason for all of this.

Maybe I was just overthinking.

I settled onto the couch, wrapping a blanket around myself, my hands clenched tight in the fabric.

I glanced at the clock.

**11:32 PM.**

My stomach twisted.

My fingers gripped the blanket tighter.

And then—

**11:33 PM.**

A long, low creak echoed through the house.

My body went rigid.

The kitchen door **swung open.**

I didn’t move. I didn’t even breathe.

A deep, suffocating darkness seeped out from the doorway, **too dark**, stretching like ink bleeding into the air. The doorway itself looked… wrong, somehow. Like it was pulling further away, stretching longer than it should have been.

I squeezed my eyes shut. **Don’t look inside. Let it remain open until 11:42 PM.**

I fumbled for my phone with shaking fingers. The screen glowed in the darkness.

**Seven minutes left.**

That was all. Seven minutes. Just wait. Just sit still.

Then—From the darkness, I heard breathing.

Not mine.

Not Timmy’s.

Something **else**.

It was deep and slow, a wet, rasping inhale, followed by an even slower exhale.

I pressed my back against the couch, my nails digging into my palms. My whole body was tense, every muscle locked in place.

The breathing got louder. Closer. So close, I could almost **feel** it against my skin.

A shudder crawled up my spine.

My phone screen flickered.

**11:41 PM.**

Almost there. Just one more minute.

The breath hitched—like it was shifting, moving.

The clock finally struck **11:42 PM.**

The sound stopped.

I opened my eyes and looked..

The kitchen door was closed.

My chest heaved as I sucked in a shaky breath. My lungs burned, like I’d been holding it in for too long. My fingers, still clenched into fists, slowly unfurled, the movement stiff and reluctant. When I glanced down, my palms were marked with deep, crescent-shaped indentations where my nails had dug in too deep. A sharp sting ran through them, but I barely registered the pain.

It was over.

For now.

I checked the time again. **11:43 PM.**

The house was silent, but not in a peaceful way. It wasn’t the kind of quiet that brought relief. It was the kind that pressed down on you, thick and suffocating, like something unseen was still there, lurking just beyond sight. Watching. Waiting.

I stayed on the couch, refusing to move. My body was still coiled tight, my muscles aching from the tension. I tried to focus on my breathing, to slow my racing pulse, to convince myself that everything was fine.

But my heart barely had time to slow before I heard—A child’s giggle.

The sound came from **upstairs**.

I went completely still.

My eyes darted to the baby monitor on the coffee table. The small screen showed Timmy’s bed. He was there. Asleep. Not moving.

The giggling got louder.

It wasn’t him.

My throat tightened.

Rule #6: **If you hear a child giggling from the second floor, ignore it. The boy you are babysitting is asleep.**

I clenched my hands into fists, nails biting into my skin. **Ignore it. Just ignore it.**

The giggling stopped.

For a moment, the house was silent again.

Then—

From behind the couch.

A whisper Came.

**“You’re no fun.”**

A cold rush of terror flooded my veins.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. I stayed perfectly still, my body locked in place, waiting.

The silence stretched on.

I sat there, frozen, until the house felt normal again.

I exhaled shakily, barely realizing I’d been holding my breath. My chest ached, my muscles weak from how tense I had been. I forced myself to check the clock.

My body sagging in relief. My heart was hammering so hard it hurt. 

**See? Nothing happened. I followed the rules, and nothing happened.**

**Everything was fine—**

And then—I heard Soft footsteps. Upstairs.

I went rigid.

I was on the couch. Timmy was asleep in his room. I had checked. I had seen him.

But, I could hear them.

Slow. Deliberate. Measured steps pressing against the wooden floor above me, moving with an eerie patience.

I gripped the armrest, my fingers digging into the fabric.

**Rule #5: If you hear footsteps upstairs while Timmy is asleep, ignore them. Do NOT go upstairs.**

I squeezed my eyes shut, breathing through my nose. **Ignore it.** It’s just noise. Just a house settling. 

I clamped a hand over my mouth, choking back the instinct to scream.

**Ignore it. Just ignore it.**

I squeezed my eyes shut, pressing my back harder into the couch, as if that would somehow shield me from whatever was up there. My whole body trembled, a cold sweat slicking my skin. The footsteps didn’t stop. They moved again—slow, deliberate. Pacing. Back and forth. Just above me.

My mind raced.

**Who… or what… was up there?**

No.

It didn’t matter.

I wasn’t going to find out.

A floorboard creaked.

The steps were moving—down the hall.

Toward Timmy’s room.

A sharp, icy panic tore through my chest. I wanted to run, to throw open his door and grab him, but I couldn’t. **The rules. Follow the rules.**

Then, I heard A whisper.

**""Miss? Why didn’t you listen?”**

A shudder rippled through me. My vision blurred. My chest ached, like the air was too thick, too heavy.

My fingers trembled as I rubbed my eyes. My breath came in short, ragged gasps.

I kept my eyes shut tight, forcing myself to block out the sound. **Don’t react. Don’t acknowledge it.** Seconds dragged into minutes, each one stretching unbearably long. 

And, Then—The footsteps stopped.

Silence.

Darkness swallowed me whole.

The dizziness hit me hard, like something had sucked all the energy from my body in an instant. 

For a moment—maybe longer—I was weightless, drifting in a void of nothingness. There was no sound, no sensation. Just an endless, suffocating emptiness. My mind felt disconnected from my body, like I was floating in a dream. Or maybe a nightmare.

My head swam. My limbs felt weak.

And then—I collapsed.

The world faded to black.

I don’t remember dreaming. I don’t remember anything at all.

I must have dozed off because the next thing I knew, I was waking up—

In Timmy’s bed.

My entire body turned to ice.

The sheets beneath me were soft. The air smelled faintly of dust and something… stale. Wrong.

I bolted upright, my pulse slamming against my ribs. **No, no, no—**

**Rule #7: If you wake up somewhere other than the couch, immediately leave the house without looking behind you.**

I sat up, frozen, my breath coming in sharp, panicked gulps.

The air around me felt thick, heavy, pressing down on my shoulders. I couldn’t hear anything—no wind, no cars outside. Just a deep, swallowing silence.

The mattress dipped.

Suddenly, From the darkness behind me, a voice whispered.

**“Emily… where are you going?”**

Something was in bed with me.

A cold sweat broke across my skin.

I did not turn around.

I forced my body to move, inch by inch. My hands trembled as I pushed the blanket off. My feet touched the cold floor.

Behind me, the presence shifted.

I bit the inside of my cheek so hard I tasted blood. **Don’t run. Don’t panic.**

And, My decision was already made.

I was leaving.

Not just this house. Not just this job.

This **town**.

I packed what little I had, stuffing my bag with trembling hands. No goodbyes. No explanations. **I didn’t want to explain.**

Because I didn’t understand.

And worse—I didn’t want to.

I stood.

I walked forward. I kept my head down as I stepped outside. 

The floor creaked under my steps.

Behind me—footsteps followed.

Soft. Slow. Playful.

I reached the hallway.

The footsteps quickened.

A breath—cold and damp—brushed the back of my neck.

**I ran.**

I hit the stairs, skipping steps, my legs burning as I pushed forward.

The footsteps behind me pounded faster, matching my speed.

I reached the front door, my fingers scrambling over the lock. My hands shook so badly I nearly dropped my keys.

I yanked the door open.

The cold night air hit me like a wave.

I sprinted outside, my heart slamming against my ribs.

I didn’t stop.

Not until I reached my car.

Only then did I turn back, gasping for breath, my hands still shaking.

The house was dark.

The front door—still wide open.

Something stood in the doorway.

Watching.

Waiting.

I didn’t stay to find out what.

The next morning, as I looked at my purse, I noticed Timmy's bear inside my bag. I had to return it, no matter what. I couldn’t keep it.

My hands still trembled as I dialed the number from the babysitting ad.

It rang once.

Twice.

Then—someone picked up.

A man’s voice. Not the father’s. **Not the mother’s.**

**“This is Officer Daniels.”**

I hesitated. **“Uh… I was trying to reach the family that lives at—”** I gave him the address, my voice unsteady.

Silence.

Then, in a careful, measured voice, the officer asked, **“Who are you trying to reach?”**

I told him the couple’s names.

Another long pause.

A cold, sinking dread settled in my stomach.

Then, finally, the officer spoke.

His voice was quiet. Cautious.

**“…That house has been abandoned for twenty years.”**

My mouth went dry.

**“No,”** I whispered. **“I was there. I babysat their son.”**

The line was silent for so long that I thought we had been disconnected.

Then, the officer exhaled. A slow, careful breath.

**“There was a little boy that lived there once.”**

I gripped my phone tighter. My heart pounded so hard it hurt.

The officer’s voice was barely above a whisper.

**“But he died in 2003.”**

The call cut off.

I stared at my phone, my chest rising and falling too fast.

Then—

I felt it.

A shift in the air.

The tiny, creeping sensation of being **watched**.

Slowly, stiffly, I turned my head.

I looked at the bear. It wasn’t the same anymore.

And I swear—**I saw it smiling at me**.",1,1742352522.0,Ruleshorror,2,1.0,False

((DISCLAIMER, this is based off my location and how we do things. Every tims will be different!! And again these are MY peeves, so please don't get mad at me for them! Read at your own risk I guess??))

-When customers in drive through say hello first (like yeah dude we know you're there. Give us a second.)

-Driving off before we tell you to drive up 

-Getting mad when we ask you to repeat something.

-Repeating your WHOLE order when we asked for clarification for ONE thing 

-If you're waiting in line, and you have the time to, and by the time you get to the window you DONT have your payment ready or rewards card even opened? What're you doing while you sit in line? Why can't you get your cards out or wallet out while you're waiting? Why make us wait when we just want you out of the drive through??

-Emptying out your whole damn car into our trash. (I say this because the garbages aren't there for you to put your own bags of trash into. It fills them up and makes it so other customers who just want to get rid of one coffee cup, can't, because someone else decided to put their bags into ours. This one's here specifically because today, someone had filled our outside bins with their own random trash, on top of random empty boxes and other trash, right into the bins... Like, why can't you just do that at home?? Do you not realize some poor minimum wage worker has to clean up after you because you were to lazy to take it out yourself? And then most likely be yelled at for taking too long to do the garbages?? Agh. Personal experiences here sorry-)

-Coming in with a resume and asking to see a manager (they're busy and I can guarantee you that they aren't gonna look at your resume until they have freetime. The normal employees are perfectly happy to drop off your resume instead of you making us think there's a complaint.)

-Not turning off your big loud trucks engines while you're at the speaker box and getting mad when we can't hear you. If you have to yell to hear yourself then maybe you should turn the engine off. 

-The passenger giving orders. (I say this because we can hear the driver A LOT better than the passenger 90% of the time.)

-asking for an extra hot latte (there's no setting to do that...? The machine does it by sensing how hot the milk is and it goes by that.)

-Extra crispy bacon.. similar to the latte thing. It's all the same and we can't make it extra crispy (but I sure wish we could!! I'm a crispy bacon person but my store usually ends up with chewy bacon.)

-More specifically the night shifts, but not calling in when you wanna order more than a dozen donuts. The bakers stop making donuts at a certain time and when you come into the store at 7pm asking for 4 dozen donuts, you best believe you're getting an angry baker and all of the old fashion plain donuts we have.)

-Going through drive through and ordering a take12 box... Please just.. just go inside.. 

-When you get to the window and you're greeted, I expect a hello back not just... Silence. I hate that. We greet you so why can't you give us the bare minimum back? Or not saying thank you when we give you your order, just driving away...

THATS IT FOR NOW!! Once again these are my own thoughts and annoyances with customers. I'm curious to see if anyone shares the same thoughts!",1,1742352495.0,TimHortons,0,1.0,False

It’s not manipulation, it’s about creating an emotional experience so powerful that she *wants* to be with you. Think of it like hacking the attraction code.

**How Does Swingcat Teach This?**

The course is structured with step-by-step lessons, covering:

* How to dismantle a woman’s ""critical factor"" (the part of her brain that resists attraction)
* The secret language of arousal that triggers deep sexual desire
* How to create tension and release to make her emotionally addicted to you
* Psychological tactics that naturally lead to intimacy

It’s packed with practical techniques, real-life examples, and exercises to help you internalize the skills quickly.

**Final Thoughts – Is It Worth It?**

If you’re tired of traditional dating advice that just doesn’t work, ""Swingcat - Sexual Connections"" offers a refreshing, psychological-based approach to attraction. It’s not about cheesy pickup lines or trying to impress women—it’s about flipping the script and making *them* chase you.

In the beginning, it worked wonders for me, which is typical for stimulants. But the thing that impressed me most was that it seemed like my social anxiety was massively improved. I had on-and-off struggles with socializing as a young lad. I did eventually get to a good point where I wasn't a social butterfly or anything but I had friends and wasn't afraid to actually talk to them. Then I got cancer, then COVID happened, so two to three years of continuous isolation flushed that down the drain and I struggled, until May of 2024

But as the months went on, my Vyvanse became less effective in most aspects. Even after slowly increasing the dosage up until reaching the peak of 70mg, it never quite reached the level of effectiveness that's expected of it. But even at its worse, my attention and focus and executive dysfunction was still better than how I would do off the medicine. The one aspect I've definitely noticed a major decline in is my social skills. I feel like they're the worst they've ever been, a complete reversal from when I started the meds rather than just being less effective like how Vyvanse impacts other aspects of my mental health. I also tend to get into caffeine binges every now and then where I relapse and drink a lot of soda and coffee after going a while on just water, which I know can impact anxiety but idk about social anxiety

My psychiatrist recently prescribed me Guanfacine to pair with my vyvanse which I've heard helps both the efficacy of stimulants and also reduces anxiety. I'm also starting therapy next week for social anxiety. But even with all of that, I'm wondering if a dosage decrease might be best. I guess I'm just wanting to see if anybody here has had similar experiences and how y'all solved it if you did

I also take 20mg prozac too",3,1742351572.0,VyvanseADHD,2,1.0,False

English Springer Spaniel, 1 year old, not neutered (male)

This all started 36 hours ago:
-Starting yesterday he was cowering when we’d talk to him
-Has to be coaxed out of his kennel
-Doesn’t jump for joy when offered to go outside
-Typically crashes into 100lb big dog sibling and gets zoomies outside 
-Now sits at door sad, wanting back inside. Would typically pace around yard defending it from anything, digging holes, etc.
-Doesn’t want to be with family or other dog, would rather go behind couch
-We really have to sweet talk him to get him to come to us 
-Not eating or drinking unless coaxed
-Does not care if we throw other dog tennis ball, typically RACES other dog and fights him for it
-Does not care if we pet or call other dog (again, he’d typically run up and push him away and steal the pets)
-Got on our other dogs bed and didn’t even acknowledge my husband when we got home from work (would typically see an opportunity and bolt out the front door, or greet him by jumping on him)
-We have a toddler and he rested his head in their lap for cuddles. This is NOT normal for him. Typically their energy matches each other and it’s a crazy, energetic playful time. Our toddler was gently petting him and he just laid there. Didn’t lick, play bite, push them over, nothing!
-Tonight he circled our coffee table for about 10-15 mins. We noticed he’d try to stop and lay down in the corner mid circle, and one of his back legs wouldn’t cooperate and fold how he wanted, so he stood up and kept circling. 
-Inside of the ear flaps appear normal
-He’s typically an ears perked, mouth open, big smile and panting dog. Now his eyes seem terrified, his ears are hung low, mouth closed and he’ll randomly just lick his lips and bring his tongue back in fast.
-Seems to be sliding around on our tile more than usual.
-We think his testicles look a little different/weird today but it’s hard to describe. They aren’t high and round like usual. They seem more dangly and odd shaped.
-We think he’s favoring a leg
-He’s been walking with his butt really low and tail tucked. He’s acting like a dog we just took home from the shelter or something but he’s been here for over a year, and we’ve had him since maybe less than 15 weeks old. 
-He didn’t want to get in his kennel, but also didn’t want to get out after being in it

Before yesterday I’ve always described this dog as nutso! We have little kids and it’s very much a puppy. He torpedos our other dog, play fights him 24/7, runs with the kids around the house, asks to go outside 1,000 times a day. He typically darts outside to zoom around or chase insects on the patio. He drastically changed yesterday. 

What’s been going on at home:

-Spring Break was last week and we had a lot of home time. The weekend was busy so he had more kennel time, but nothing more than some usual busy weekends. I’m pregnant and had a checkup just before the weekend started and found out the baby is now head down. I’m not close to my due date, but we’re getting there. Over the weekend we purchased some baby stuff so the house was full of boxes and products that we slowly organized into the nursery. Monday morning the big kids were back in school and my husband was gone all day. Monday he was so different. Not sure if any of this is relevant or if I’m just projecting my worries onto him. 
-We got a new bag of food for him at Petsmart and he started eating it maybe 2 days before this started. I noticed recently when we put the food in his bowl he didn’t rush to eat it. His food sat all day. He’s never, ever done this. ",1,1742351237.0,DogAdvice,1,1.0,False

Some collect cars. I collect obedient, financially capable men who understand that submission isn’t about throwing cash at a stranger—it’s about structure, purpose, and long-term devotion.

I am not here for every man. I am not here for thrill-seekers, time-wasters, or those who think $20 is a meaningful tribute. I am here for men who find peace in financial surrender, who crave control, discipline, and the privilege of belonging to something greater than themselves.

I am quality over quantity. I would rather have a handful of devoted, high-caliber submissives who receive my attention, structure, and expertise than a hundred mindless men throwing money for a fleeting moment of interaction. This is about something deeper—an authentic Dom/sub relationship built on devotion, obedience, and financial servitude. I do not entertain inconsistency, desperation, or those who lack the financial stability to sustain long-term submission.

That’s why your first act of submission is non-negotiable.
	•	$50 initial tribute—because access is earned, not given.
	•	Age verification—because I don’t engage with children or liars.
Fail either, and you’re wasting my time (and yours).

This is not about buying my coffee. I am not interested in meaningless tributes from men looking for a quick rush. If all you want is to send money and disappear, I am not the one for you. I take ownership seriously, and I expect my submissives to as well.

What I Offer (For Those Who Prove Themselves)
	•	Long-term financial control and submission. I don’t entertain one-time thrill-seekers. I build lasting devotion.
	•	Exclusive financial mentorship and consulting for high-earning men who need structure in both their finances and their submission.
	•	Private access (Telegram & VIP spaces) for those who prove their commitment.
	•	One-on-one drain sessions for those ready to surrender fully.
	•	Luxury-based submission experiences for men who understand that wealth is meant to be worshiped.

What I Don’t Entertain
	•	Free chats and endless excuses. If you have to ask why, you don’t belong here.
	•	Men who think $50 is a life-changing amount. If that’s you, focus on improving your finances before coming back.
	•	Instant gratification seekers. This is about discipline, not indulgence.

Please let me know if there’s a better subreddit, if not, thank you in advice for reading.

Back when my roommate and I first met, they learned that I spend a lot of time on YouTube, like A LOT.

YouTube has been my form of entertainment for years now, I’d say daily viewer of content for 12 years. I grew up quite sheltered and didn’t watch much tv or listen to a lot of music so YouTube was basically a perfect place for me to watch and listen to whatever I wanted. The type of content I watched has changed over the years, but I’ll be honest, the content mainly watch today definitely isn’t great. I’ve definitely learned things from YouTube, like how to make good coffee and how to take better care of animals like cats, but I’d say over 90% of the content I view is random internet commentary or videos from years ago I’ve seen a million times to the point of quoting. 

The understandable concern has come up multiple times, as my roommate began to notice that I didn’t take part in many interests or hobbies outside of watching YouTube. For example, I like to crochet, but I do so while watching YouTube. They’ve tried getting me into Magic the Gathering, DnD, comedy, new tv shows, wrestling, videos games like Stardew valley and animal crossing, anything to spark my interest and imagination, but nothing has stuck. All of these things have been interesting to learn and I do partake in them, but regardless of how interested I am, I constantly fall back to watching YouTube. It got to a point where I was watching YouTube for 60hrs/week, which is more than I work in a week. Thankfully I’ve been able to lower it recently, but it’s still insane.

I really want to break this cycle and start getting excited about things outside of YouTube, but I’m not really sure how or where to start. It seems like a no brainer, but it’s surprisingly hard for me to break the routine, I’m honestly quite shocked at how much time I spend on this website and not really learning anything I can take with me outside of YouTube. I’m at a point where I don’t have the “patience” per se for tv shows and movies, which has me extra concerned. I don’t like this addiction(?) I have to YouTube but I want to learn how to find the same excitement I get from YouTube videos in other places.",1,1742349786.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

I occasionally have the desire or a recipe that calls for a flat bottom brewer. In those cases, I've been using my B75.

BUT, I probably used my Timemore B75 maybe just a couple of dozen times and the bottom of the base is turning brown.

My thinking is,  if the brewer is absorbing coffee, what is the coffee absorbing?

So, I have  an excuse for a new flat bottom brewer.

I have a birthday coming Friday and searched Reddit for recommendations and opinions on the Kalita185 line and the Oreas v4. Gave my family the results and think they're getting me the Tsubame. 

Thank you for your past opinions , even though I wasn't the one  who asked for them.

Looked at each model except the stainless steel with the reputation for clogging.

Curiously, I was at Vigilante Coffee in Hyattsville,  Maryland this morning and noticed that the ss was what they were using. The barista told me they previously used the glass Kalita but broke too many of them.  

Maybe they were pouring with the 155, now that I think of it. 

Okay and thanks again. I'm now a novice member of team Kalita.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I have been lurking for some time on this sub, and I saw many fantastic setups!

Long story short - our autistic child wanted a pet, so my wife got him a betta fish. He called him Meep. Some reference to Sponge Bob... Meep lived in a 10 gallon tank and was pretty happy with his fake plants. A few months ago we were moving and Meep was not doing so great. Amidst the packing etc. the water in his tank got pretty yucky, low level, the heater was still on. Suffices to say that by the time I could tend to Meep, he was hiding in a small cave in the gravel, submerged in some sort of warm slurry that once used to be water. He was transferred to a small portable container, treated with medicine, tank was well oxigenated with an aerator stone. Some hard conversations had ben held about how Meep is not going to make it... He got better! The tank was cleaned, some new fake plants were put in. He was happy until one day he passed after a few months in his new place. The house felt very empty. Kids were very sad. Even I was missing something in the house. I did some water change in the tank and got a Koi betta - my son named him Seek.

Seek is doing well but looking at all the tanks on this sub I wanted to have a tank with natural plants as well. So, I pulled the trigger today and got some. Also, got some rocks and driftwood for the hardscape.

I removed all the water into a bucket, tossed all the fake plants (they were COVERED with algae!), cleaned the heater (covered with some brown slime), and cleaned the filter housing (not the sponge). The sponge was rinsed in the removed aquarium water. I rinsed the gravel in a sieve using the removed aquarium water. I filtered the remaining water with a coffee filter to remove floating stuff and the new water in the aquarium is 50% old water and 50% new water.

Now, for my question - how to I keep the plants thriving? I have a light that is designed for planted tanks.

Basically, I would like a few things:

\- have plants grow nicely (we are talking amazon sword, anubias, African fern, rotala...)

\- have the aquarium water nice and clear

\- not have algae any more

Is it really all about keeping the lights on for max 8h, not overfeeding the fish, and doing a regular water change (like 20% once a week)?",2,1742349517.0,bettafish,1,1.0,False
1jemapu,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1jemapu/overcoming_social_anxiety_a_practical_guide/,Overcoming Social Anxiety: A Practical Guide,"Social anxiety is the **fear of being judged, embarrassed, or rejected in social situations**. It’s more than just shyness—it’s a deep-rooted discomfort that can make everyday interactions feel overwhelming.

Social anxiety can show up in many ways:

* Overthinking everything you say or do in social settings.
* Feeling like people are always watching or judging you.
* Avoiding eye contact or speaking up in groups.
* Physical symptoms like sweating, shaking, or a racing heart.

# How Does It Develop?

Social anxiety often comes from **past experiences, negative self-beliefs, or fear of failure**. Maybe you were embarrassed in a past social situation, or you grew up in an environment where you felt unseen or unworthy. Over time, your brain starts associating social settings with **danger**, triggering anxiety whenever you’re around people.

For example:  
🚫 **A student avoids raising their hand in class** because they fear saying the wrong answer and being laughed at.  
🚫 **Someone skips a party** because they think no one will talk to them or they’ll say something awkward.  
🚫 **A person rehearses their words over and over before sending a text** because they fear saying the wrong thing.

# How to Resolve Social Anxiety (Step-by-Step Exercise)

The goal isn’t to eliminate discomfort **but to train your brain to stop seeing social situations as a threat**. This takes **exposure, mindset shifts, and self-compassion**.

# Step 1: Challenge the Fear (Reality Check)

🧠 **What to do:** Write down your biggest fear in social situations. Then, challenge it with logic.

* Ask yourself: *What’s the worst that can realistically happen?*
* Ask: *Has this actually happened before, or is it just a fear?*
* Ask: *Would I judge someone else the way I think others judge me?*

**Example:**  
🚶‍♂️ *Fear:* “If I talk to someone new, they’ll think I’m awkward.”  
✅ *Reality:* “Most people are focused on themselves, not on judging me. Even if I stumble on my words, it’s normal.”

# Step 2: Gradual Exposure (Start Small, Level Up)

📌 **What to do:** Slowly push yourself into social situations, starting small and working your way up. The more you **face social situations**, the more your brain learns they aren’t a threat.

**Levels of exposure:**  
🟢 **Easy:** Smile at a stranger, hold eye contact for 3 seconds.  
🟡 **Moderate:** Start a short conversation with a barista or cashier.  
🔴 **Harder:** Join a social event or speak in a group setting.

**Example:**  
🎤 If public speaking terrifies you, start by **talking to yourself in the mirror**, then **record a video**, then **speak in front of one person**, and eventually **a small group**.

# Step 3: Shift the Focus (From Yourself to Others)

🌀 **What to do:** Social anxiety makes you hyper-aware of yourself. Instead, shift your focus to the **other person**. Ask them questions, listen, and engage. This reduces self-consciousness.

**Example:**  
👥 Instead of thinking, *“What if they think I’m weird?”*, focus on **getting to know them**:

* “What’s something you’re passionate about?”
* “What’s the best trip you’ve ever taken?”
* “If you could master any skill overnight, what would it be?”

# Step 4: Rewire Negative Self-Talk

📝 **What to do:** Identify the critical voice in your head and replace it with a **supportive** one. The way you speak to yourself **affects your confidence**.

🚫 *Negative:* “I always embarrass myself.”  
✅ *Reframe:* “Every interaction is a chance to grow.”

🚫 *Negative:* “I have nothing interesting to say.”  
✅ *Reframe:* “I bring value by being a great listener.”

**Example:**  
🎭 *Before a party:* Instead of thinking, *“I’m so awkward, I’ll just stand in a corner,”* tell yourself, *“I’m open to new conversations, and I’ll focus on being present.”*

# Step 5: Practice Presence (Ground Yourself in the Moment)

Social anxiety thrives on **overthinking the past or worrying about the future**. The key is to **stay in the present moment**.

🌿 **Grounding exercise:**

* **Breathe deeply** (inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 4).
* **Observe your surroundings** (What do you see? Hear? Smell?).
* **Feel your feet on the ground** and remind yourself: *“I am safe. I belong here.”*

**Example:**  
☕ *At a coffee shop:* Instead of stressing about what others think, focus on **sipping your drink, feeling the cup’s warmth, and enjoying the ambiance**. This keeps you grounded.

# Final Thoughts: Confidence is Built, Not Given

Overcoming social anxiety **is a process**—it won’t disappear overnight, but each step you take builds confidence. **Courage isn’t the absence of fear, it’s acting despite fear.**

🔥 **The more you practice, the more natural socializing becomes.** You are **worthy of connection**, and with time, you’ll realize—people are just people, and no one is perfect.",0,1742349470.0,spirituality,3,0.5,False

I have a co worker who’s older, just to put it into perspective she’s a grandmother already. At the particular store I work at it’s only drive thru and walk up window so we’re a little unique from other coffee shops. My co worker hasn’t improved since she’s got hired about a year ago too. It’s to the point where it’s truly overwhelming working with her. I truly love my job and my co workers especially as a college student. But this older lady has no business working at a high pace environment and she can only do one drink in 5 minutes when I can do 4 drinks in 5 minutes at the same exact time. I’ve expressed this issue to management multiple times over the course of several months and still see no improvement or no one addressing the issue. After today’s shift I wrote a long message and sent it to some co workers and their feedback was that it was too emotional and I should really sleep on it and then go forward and confronting management again. It’s also difficult because she truly kisses ass to our boss and our manager. I just think it’s so unfair her work ethic is absolutely trash and she makes me life difficult.

I work in a building with 2 unions. Over the past few years there have been several issues between members of my union and the other union, many of them involving the other union’s president (who is also nuts). There have been investigations and arbitrations and most of the results have gone against the other union and its president. 

After years of going without an HR representative my employers finally hired one except she has become buddies with the insane union president and is now being weaponized against my membership. Their relationship extends outside of the building and we have social media posts of them having doggy play dates at each others houses. They also hang out together frequently in the building with the union president having coffee in the HR office. My membership is being harassed non stop and wouldn’t even think about going to HR with an issue, even if it doesn’t involve the other union, as nobody thinks they will be treated fairly. 

I have a meeting tomorrow with a member who is being told she can’t use the door closest to the parking lot to enter our staff lounge because sometimes the president of the other union sits there. This is what the HR person has brought forward! This is how our company is spending its time! 

Anyone have advice for me on how to handle this insanity? Ideally how to get rid of this HR person for someone with some kind of professional standards",1,1742349153.0,jobs,0,1.0,False

I was arrested early hours yesterday morning, taken to the police station and then to the Magistrates Court at 6am. On the way in I was asked if I had any medical conditions, but neglected to tell them about my bladder problems as I'm an extremely nervous person anyway, and it's an embarrassing problem for me. 

 I get to the cell and I'm offered a coffee, I drink it and an hour later I'm offered another. Once I drank the second, I had the sudden urge to urinate. I pressed the cell buzzer but it wasn't answered in time and I could not hold it. I used both cups but it still wasn't enough and eneded up getting some on the floor too, and did my best to hide it in the corner of the room. After meeting my solicitor, I went back in and accidentally kicked the cups over, basically flooding the cell. I panicked, and poured the 3rd cup of coffee I was given over the floor, to try to cover up what I'd done.

Nobody noticed while I went to court and was released, now I'm worried they'll want to issue an arrest warrant for me for criminal damage. I didn't  explain what happened to anyone, so I'm worried they'll think I'm not genuine. Do I have anything to worry about?",3,1742349132.0,LegalAdviceUK,4,0.67,False

How do you use being a southpaw to your advantage?,"Ok so this subreddit has become a little whiny about being left-ahead.  It’s time to look at the advantages.   Where do you get ahead by going left?   


1.  Coffee cup.   Sure I don’t see the logo, but that just means I buy obnoxious Alma-mater logo cups, that all of my staff are blessed to enjoy.  

2. Right handed computer mouse.  Unfortunately I was classically trained with the boring starboard paw mouse work, but there is a huge advantage… I can drink coffee and computer mouse at the same time.  The other 90 % is actually required to set their mugs down.  

3.  Driving a stick-shift while drinking coffee.  Same as above.  Back when we had stick shifts in the US (if you are under 30 Google it), I could stick shift right and drink coffee left.  Maximize caffeine efficiency.   

4.  Left side soccer positions.  Sure I’m really speaking of being left-footed, but it applies.   On left side halfback, I had a powerful kick that could drive the ball down the left line.  

5.  Winches on a sailboat.  Left hand grind, right hand tail.  Even better as port trimmer.    

Sure I have to be selective and creative.   And when I do, I dominate.  

If you are looking for a theme, yes the caffeine helps!  ",4,1742349017.0,lefthanded,8,1.0,False
1jem4h8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_peggycarterspy/comments/1jem4h8/dear_tiramisu/,Dear Tiramisu,"I wish there was a way I could say things to you in person, but since I can’t I’m writing you this. I don’t know how else to tell you anything. I didn’t expect yesterday either. I feel so far away yet so connected to you still. I thought I could just ignore everything, pretend I’m super cool/chill and feel indifferent, but then I got out of the car and saw you and my heart stopped. You take my breath away every single time. I can’t believe you’re real sometimes and that my eyes get to experience you. Even after a few days of not seeing you, you're as handsome as ever. I spent the whole weekend trying to get away, trying to medicate my feelings, trying to get you out of my head and none of it worked. You’re ingrained in there. Every thought, every dream. I missed you. Every time something fun or good happened I wanted to tell you, wanted to share it with you, wanted your opinion, wanted your thoughts. When I had the worst dinner on Friday night you were the first person I wanted to call. I wanted your reassurance. You said nothing is your business, but I want to make everything your business. I want to be your best friend, but how do I do that? You will barely talk to me now. I don’t want the 9-5 only. I want to share my life with you. I want you to know everything. 

I was trying to tell you yesterday, but failed, that I have never once in my life had someone share the same thoughts as me, same feelings as me, same dreams/goals. I haven’t met someone who understands my weirdness and sees it as an attractive trait. I swear I can tell things that you’re anxious about because I too get anxious about the same things. Not to be pretentious, but I know when you need calm reassurance because it’s similar to moments when I need it too. You said people always broke up with you and nobody ever found you attractive, which first of all, how? I’m sorry I got heated in the car, but you’re wildly gorgeous. I wish you could see you how I see you. But I too understand how you feel as I have never been found attractive. Not in high school or my college years or by trash bag. I never got asked out on dates or was the person that people wanted to keep around. I’m the one they use and abuse until I am deflated and dull. 

I thought you wouldn’t text me once this weekend. I thought we’d go back to talking M-F and that was that. I cannot tell you the absolute happiness I felt when I saw your text, when your name popped up on my screen. Can I admit something weird? This keeps happening, and even in my drunken haze I had some weird feeling to check my phone and boom you texted me at that moment. Also at that moment, I wish I was joking, but my sister was talking about the blood moon and how the stars aligned for me to have a clear night to view it the night before. I almost fell over in the bowling alley. The stars aligned. Our connection is so intense even apart. I feel like we are weirdly intertwined and the stars align to keep us attached. I got on my flight home thinking you must have hated me and that maybe you wouldn’t talk to me on Monday, then when I got off the plane and saw you had texted I cried in the middle of the airport. I have to selfishly admit that’s all I ever wanted, was someone who cared about me.

I have self-destructive tendencies and one is running away. I run and hide because it protects me, it protects my heart. I’ve done it since I was a kid because I know I won’t get hurt. I won’t have my heart broken if I do this. I’ve ran and hid my whole life. I’ve put up the wall and slid back into my shell, but somehow I cannot do it with you. I cannot risk losing you. You broke the wall, you stood in my way of running. I don’t know how but you’re the only person to do it. I don’t want to run and hide. I want to stand in front of you and bare my soul. 

My whole life I’ve dreamt of you. I feel like you’ve somehow been there in the background. I just never expected to find you this way. I literally have waited my whole life to find someone who feels the same way I do, who thinks the same way I do, who literally has the same quirks as me, same kinks as me. There are still weird coincidences happening to us, like yesterday with the hamburgers. It’s interesting to me how much you overthink and would always apologize for things you had NO reason to apologize for. I was NEVER mad at you. I’m not even mad at you now. I can’t even hate you right now. All I can do is cry and wish and wish. I only can say all of this because I feel like the whole world is mad at me 24/7. I overthink and feel like I need to know that everything’s ok. I just understand you so well because I feel and think the exact same. How on planet earth do I let go of that? How do I learn to walk alone? I told you I feel like the story of Orpheus and Eurydice…I feel like I’m being pulled back to the Underworld. I can’t claw my way out this time. It hurts too much. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to say. I don’t know how much I can apologize. I don’t know where to turn. Who do I talk to? Where did you go? Why was it me? I have begged and pleaded on my hands and knees for something to change my fate. 

I told you not to live in the what if’s but I do. What if we finally created our own rotation? What if we could watch our shows together on the couch? What if we went around and found fun places to eat? What if we traveled to Europe? What if you showed me the world of photography and we took photos together? What if we sat and watched cool youtube videos together? What if, what if, what if? I live in the what if everyday. It has me trapped by its claws. It haunts me while I sleep, eat, shower, drive. I can’t escape it. 

I don’t know if I am doing the right thing either. I don’t know if I’m doing the right thing by writing this. I was terrified to admit my feelings last week and even more now. Unrequited feelings break apart your soul. You can’t possibly care about me because I care about you more than you know. I’m so incredibly proud of you. I hope you get told how proud people are of you. I wish I could go around telling people how amazing you are, how proud I am of you, how smart you are, how kind, how everything. I wish I could brag about you. Tiramisu, look at how far you’ve come in your career. All that you’ve accomplished, how fast you are at learning it all. You pick up things so fast and are so quick to help others. But you sir are more than your career. Look at what an incredible friend you are. I always hear how much you care about your friends and their interests. I loved hearing about someone’s server and what they upload on it or someone working on their car. You always make time for them. You care so much about their lives, their interests. I’ve never met a friend like you. You’re the type of person people look up to. I hope you look at yourself in the mirror everyday and realize that one person on this earth thinks you’re absolutely incredible, you’re handsome, intelligent, kind and caring. I could say it one hundred times over until it stuck - you got the smallest room but the biggest heart. 

I also care more because I only reactivated my account to see if you were active, to know you were somewhere out there, alive and happy. I don’t know where your happiness lies. I just want you to be happy. If there was an opportunity to give up my own happiness so you could be happy forever I would do it. I wouldn’t even hesitate. I love when you smile. I love making you laugh. I love our inside jokes. I would allow myself to get dragged to the Underworld like Eurydice if it meant knowing that your smile would live on forever. When I was trapped a few years ago someone told me, life is short and scary but you should chase where the sun lives(aka find your happiness). You are my sun, wish I wasn’t admitting this, but you are. It’s like I’m at the bottom of a very deep pool. The water is cool and clear. I’m standing on the floor looking up at the water’s surface and the sun is reflecting all the way to the bottom of the pool, warming my face up even though I’m a few feet under water. The sunlight pulls me and draws me in, telling me to swim to the surface. The sun tells me to tread the water because it’ll be at the top to help keep me warm. I’ve never felt this warmth before. It’s intoxicating how much I wish to stay on the surface so I can feel the sun for once. 

I was not lying when I talked about doing taxes and laundry. I would love just doing the mundane with you all the time. Going to doctor’s appointments, cleaning the kitchen, a car wash, watering plants, going to the grocery store, vacuuming, hour long showers, cleaning a coffee maker, making dinner, getting gas. I could and would love doing it all. I could spend every day with you, and would enjoy every second of every minute of every day. I feel like I could talk to you about anything and would never run out of things to say. I wasn’t kidding when I said I was on the plane and I pictured you in the seat next to me, sharing an Ipad watching some show we both love, traveling somewhere where we don’t have any responsibilities, no cares, no worries…just us and maybe some floor to ceiling windows.

I’m hurt. I’m so incredibly hurt. I wish I could lie and be like I’m cool, but that’s not me. I have big emotions. I can’t accept your apology, but I also want to forgive you. 

You said you’d do anything I wanted. I want to be selfish and say be my friend forever and ever. I literally want you to text me, to message me, to ask questions, to talk about food, shows, to let me inside of your head. Let me know what you’re thinking. Since last week and the letter I have been non-stop thinking about what you must think. I have been desperately wanting to know what your reply to my letter would be. I cannot imagine my life without you even though I’m trying to push you away. Don’t let me push you away. Don’t let me run away. I need you here. I am about to walk into a lion’s den and I feel more alone than ever, but somehow you’re helping me. I can’t lose you now. I feel so selfish. I need you here. All of this scares me. It feels like one big prank. Like I’m going to wake up one day and you’ll say SIKE, I hate you, I don’t want to be your friend, I can’t stand you. If you somehow hate me just tell me, it’ll be faster than having to imagine it.

Even though I cry a lot around you, you’ve made me stronger, braver, wiser, even kinder. I am always thinking, what would Tiramisu think? Would Tiramisu be proud of me? How would Tiramisu react? You’re my moral compass somehow. If you had told me a year ago that I would have done half the things in the last few months that I did I wouldn’t have believed you. You change people's lives sir - another thing to be proud of yourself for. Am I doing the right thing writing this to you? Am I doing the right thing not letting go? Am I doing the right thing by being your friend? I don’t know, but I can’t hide from you forever. I can’t hide my thoughts. I keep wanting to dump my thoughts out to you. I wish I did in the car yesterday, but I’m scared….so so so incredibly scared. I can’t lose my sunlight. 

I still hope you don’t hate me after this.

You’re my moral compass somehow. If you had told me a year ago that I would have done half the things in the last few months that I did I wouldn’t have believed you. You change people's lives sir - another thing to be proud of yourself for. Am I doing the right thing writing this to you? Am I doing the right thing not letting go? Am I doing the right thing by being your friend? I don’t know, but I can’t hide from you forever. I can’t hide my thoughts. I keep wanting to dump my thoughts out to you. I wish I did in the car yesterday, but I’m scared….so so so incredibly scared. I can’t lose my sunlight. 

I still hope you don’t hate me after this. 

Forever & Always,

(Really long),"I (25F) am giving birth in the next few weeks and have been struggling with the mental load of pregnancy which came with so much loneliness considering that my father and I are no contact (about 12 years or so) and not having a normal relationship with my mother. I only have my older sister who also gave birth almost 4 months ago, and we share the same experience.

The backstory with my mother goes way back to as far as I can remember being aware of myself, from physical to mental abuse, you name it. She suffered cervical cancer back in 2008 when my sister and I were 8 and 10, and our parents shortly got a divorce after she got her treatment. She got the treatment she needed, thank God, and is cancer free. She has never in her life worked a single day, has lived off government support and money from her parents. When our parents divorced, our grandmother (her mother) paid our rent, bills, food, everything, even put my sister and I through school. My mother sadly saw how easy it is for her to live off others' pity and realized that's the path she wants to take. She would fake still going to cancer treatments out of country so her parents would send her money, but she would never actually go. My sister and I also never saw that money as we would starve for days and I would have to ask my close friends to lend me menstrual pads. 

When my sister went away to college it was just me and our mother, as I was still in high school. The whole narcissistic relationship with her put a heavy mental load on me during my teenage years where I would lack in school, sleep all day, have thoughts about suicide and self harm. I was scared of hearing her footsteps around the apartment, as well as training myself to hear her when she climbs the stairs in the building jiggling her keys before she enters the apartment, and just pretend to sleep when she comes home. A lot of the time we didn't have hot water, our stove didn't work, we almost faced trial because she didn't pay the electricity bills and all we had to eat was frozen chicken for months. She would receive money from other parts of her family, selling them the same story she would sell to her own parents. She would use old scans and doctor's notes to make her story liable as no one ever doubted her of course. We just never saw any of the money, because she got used to lending money from other people, and got stuck in a cycle of receiving-lending-paying back, and even getting me in situations where people would verbally attack me because she wasn't paying them money back. She got both my sister and I to take a loan out for her as soon as we were eligible to do so, and would slack on paying back causing us harm because people would come straight to us and not her. I always wanted to get a job, but she would knock me down by saying if I got a job she would lose her government support and I was stuck with my hands tied. I was afraid of telling anyone in our family (e.g. her parents) because they live 3 hours away from us and I was afraid of what she would do to me, because as I said she would also physically abuse my sister and me. We also found her online personas where she would pretend to be wealthy, good looking young people on her fake profiles. Mind you, all she did day by day was spend her time on the phone watching reality tv until the sun rises, and go for coffee with her friends. All her friends were always well-off people she could take advantage of.

Fast forward to me turning 21, I got my first job as a waitress and when I told her, it was a collapse but when I explained I wouldn't tell her parents or that she wouldn't lose any government privileges, she calmed down and realized she could use me now as well. My paycheck wasn't big but for the sake of peace I would give her a certain amount, and whenever she requested help with groceries or just wanted pocket money I would give her. That's when she mostly started acting nice, but my main goal by getting a job was to find a place for myself and get the hell out of that hole. And so I did, a few months later I saved money for rent and a deposit, I developed a whole plan of leaving her and the apartment for good. I was extremely scared but I did it. As per usual, she would threaten to kill herself, jump off the balcony, jump of a bridge and whatnot. 

The first few nights I spent in the apartment were horrible because I got threats from her via texts, phone calls, etc. and her telling me she would figure out where I am and come to my door. I lived in the apartment for 6 months, after which I caved and moved back (you know how narcs guilt trip you with the story they've changed) and 21y/o me just wanted her mom and had high hopes that maybe reality has finally hit her and we could make things work. Things were fine for a couple of months as you could have guessed, but after that it gradually started to look the same as before. The threats, the lies, the funny business, I just couldn't take it anymore. Every time I would receive a text or a call if I wasn't at home I would be on edge. 

At the same time when I moved back I started dating my now husband (37M), and the father of the boy I'm carrying. The age gap (12y) didn't sit well with anyone in my family and I could understand that because it isn't something our communities really support, but fast forward until today, he is so loved by my sister, uncle, grandparents and wider family and that tells you just about everything about him and our relationship that you need to know. She on the other hand wanted to kill me for it. Thankfully, when we were about a year and a half into dating he was looking for apartments and I suggested we look together and move in as I was certain about taking our relationship to that next level of commitment. She took that hard, especially since my sister never moved back since finishing college and that would mean she would have to be completely on her own. You know, narcs and not having a victim around. We moved in and thrived, after which he proposed and during our wedding plans (about a month before our wedding) we found out I'm pregnant. My sister was 5 months pregnant at that time as well.

Before I found out I was pregnant I lost my job and everything was on my husband's back a couple months after our wedding, which was when most of my savings had run out. He had a really well  paying job so it wasn't too much of a load. My mom would ask my sister and I (both pregnant) to lend her money, and I just couldn't because I didn't want to give her my husband's well earned money as I knew she just spends money on cigarettes, her phone, and paying people back. My sister was preparing for her baby and had a monthly payment for her apartment which she and her husband had bought so it was only normal of her to refuse as well.

Things started going even more downhill when my sister and I suggested she gets an easier job (since she loves to use the ""but I'm sick and you people are monsters for wanting me to work"" card). We kindly spoke to her and suggested it would make her whole quality of life easier, she would get out of the house, meet other people, and just simply have some sort of an obligation overy day. We both got ""you all hate me, I don't need your money, I'm sick, no one would want to hire me because I'm old (46 btw), I'm ugly and everyone wants gorgeous girls"" etc. etc. etc. But what hurt me the most out of all the things I listed in this whole post, is her telling me ""I wish I were as smart as your father and just simply left you when I could have"". That left a really deep mark on my pregnant, hormonal little heart because even in the event of all these things I just wanted her to get help and be the mom I needed her to be. She stopped talking to both me and my sister, and only rekindled communication with her a few days before she gave birth. Which in my opinion is the peak of manipulation, especially towards a woman who is just about to experience postpartum.

She made a whole scene about not visting my sister when she left the hospital, despite being told when that would be, except she probably expected a personal, hand written invite from my freshly pp sister. She cried to her mother about being heartbroken, and my grandma attacked my sister on her first day at home for not including my mom. That's when I completely lost my marbles and yelled at absolutely everyone for doing that to my sister. Imagine, instead of enjoying your first day at home with your newborn daughter, you get attacked from so many sides for something you didn't even do. Just goes to show you how much our mother loves being the center of attention and to which point it goes.

A few weeks later, I receive a call from a friend of my mom's who is closer to my age and also attended my wedding, and who I had a really nice relationship with. She told me that my mother owes her 800 euros and 200 euros to her brother. My sister's husband also overheard a conversation that the brother of the girl had with a friend, about wanting to ask me and my sister for that whole 1000 euros back. I was in so much stress because my sister and I forgot about the factor of other people who she lends money from, tying us to our mother as she is so keen on painting a perfect mother-daughter relationship and how she helps us and hangs out with us almost daily. I lost my mind. I was so scared of the stress causing harm to my baby that I completely shut myself off. My sister and I were both afraid of the possibility of other people attacking us and our children and making us pay for her mistakes.

During our uncle's visit around the new year's, we told him absolutely everything about our situation with her and seeking help from him as someone clearly needed to give her the ultimatum. He told us that this has been and ongoing problem with her since she was a teenager, as she would steal money, jewelry and other precious stuff from their family house at 17 years old and give it all to men she would date at the time. He also told us about the type of dangerous men she would date after her divorce with our father, and hanging out mostly with women who would, well, do sex work. He said he would take care of it, and that we have nothing to worry about.

Well, we had something to worry about, and it was the fact that he simply woke up tomorrow and decided not to do it, and blame it on us of not telling them anything earlier, and according to him we should do it ourselves. The only step taken was our grandmother telling her she should get a job, but to this day she still pays her rent and sends her money, so nothing has changed.

I've had zero contact with my mother since the period of new year, not even a simple how are you handling pregnancy, etc. It has been so lonely hearing other pregnant women talk about their moms helping them cook, clean and nest whereas I have absolutely no one close in family to do that for me. I don't count my sister as a part of that of course since she is doing more than enough as a new mother herself. The only contact I had with her was when grandma sent her money thtough my account and I had to give it to her. That was the only time she asked me how I was, and that was a week ago. And now, just like with my sister, she's trying to restart communication a little bit before I give birth, and she even said ""if you need help with anything before you give birth, just tell me"" which only makes things worse as it brings me flashbacks to my sister's postpartum experience. It's all the same.

Now I figured someone has to put a stop to it, as I really need to either let it go and move on or accept her the way it is and the latter doesn't really sit well with me. That's why I am ready to be the biggest asshole and tell her; here's the thing, if you want to be a part of this child's life, you'll have to fix yours first. I know what he and I went throughout my entire pregnancy and the stress he had to feel because of her, all while unborn. It's not fair to him. Either change, or forget about being a grandma, let alone a mother. And the outcome of that would be enough for me to make the decision whether or not I should let go. I also want my husband and I to go visit my parents for sunday lunch and hang out, like we do with his whole entire family who have accepted me with arms wide open. I can't thank them enough. My mother in law is an angel on earth. But this whole thing is making me tired, it's draining me and I feel like it needs to end somewhere and I don't care if it makes me the biggest bad guy, I just want the best for me and my child now.

If there is anyone out there who read the entire thing, thank you. I needed to get this off, and I need a bit of reassurance that I'm doing the right thing. 🥰",6,1742348551.0,narcissisticparents,5,1.0,False

Currently we do pastries (croissants, banana bread, bread pudding, cookies, cakes, quiche, and toast as a side for soup). Everything is pre-baked in the kitchen and some items go through a reheat for service. This is a relatively new operation and the only equipment we have currently is a home style toaster oven and a microwave. This works ok for warming banana bread or making toast. Not ideal for reheating quiche, but we are making it work. The oven is behind the coffee bar and baristas do the firing.

We are about to expand our menu. We are planning to add a couple of flavors of  ""cheese toasties"" (let me know if you know a better name), flatbread to be served with hummus which will need warming, and hopefully in the near future, flatbread pizzas and reheating pre-made waffles to order. We expect volume to exceed the little toaster oven capacity just about immediately. I think all of these things could be accomplished at, say, 400F for varying amounts of time, but I'd need to test them.

We are trying to decide what type of oven to purchase. I have been thinking of a tabletop convection oven [like this one](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/avantco-co-14-quarter-size-countertop-convection-oven-0-8-cu-ft-120v-1440w/177CO14.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&gclid=Cj0KCQjws-S-BhD2ARIsALssG0aaKtKIArl2AO579Vp0aAy2XUC4_BU-CMB8fjQNe6eAOnnt_KAKw0MaAlKBEALw_wcB). But now I wonder if it would need to stay preheated or if a toaster oven is really what we need. A merrychef would be ideal, but our budget is low, probably $500 max. If we start doing volume and making money on the new program, we could upgrade later. It would need to be a countertop model, but there is a decent amount of space for a footprint.

Any thoughts?

This is my birthday trip I’m taking with her next month. I already live near the beach in the US so while CR is warmer than it currently is here, making their beach more enjoyable, I feel like if I’m flying all the way there the coffee, chocolate, jungle, sloth and volcano excursions are all the most important and unique. 

I think Guanacaste has better flights for us and we read that Guanacaste is safer and more pleasant than San Jose, but it doesn’t look to be near any of the volcanoes and I’m worried about having a dull time and bland hotel food 😕

This might be the wrong trip to try to take with my 65 year old mother but I thought it would be easier to travel with her rather than dealing with a friend group with opposing budgets, opinions and availability. 

Does anyone have hotel suggestions near Guanacaste that I’ll still be able to do excursions and maybe enjoy local cafes? Maybe a little more inward rather than on the beach is better for that? Is San Jose really so bad?

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking.

    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\

    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jelpc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartBizBooks/comments/1jelpc2/mixing_personal_and_business_finances_say_goodbye/,Mixing Personal and Business Finances? Say Goodbye to Your Money!,"Did you know that mixing personal and business finances could trigger a tax audit, put your personal assets at risk, and make tax season a nightmare? If you're still using the same bank account for both business and personal expenses, you might be making a costly mistake.

While it may seem convenient at first, failing to separate your finances can lead to legal issues, financial mismanagement, tax penalties, and missed business growth opportunities. In this guide, we'll uncover the real dangers of combining personal and business funds, share practical examples, and provide expert tips to keep your finances organized.

If you’re serious about protecting your business and avoiding financial chaos, keep reading!

**The Hidden Dangers of Mixing Personal and Business Finances**

Many small business owners and freelancers assume that using their personal bank account for business transactions is harmless. However, this short-term convenience can lead to long-term financial and legal headaches. Here’s why:

**1. Confusing Bookkeeping and Cash Flow Management**

When business and personal transactions are mixed, tracking income and expenses becomes difficult. Without clear records, you won’t know if your business is profitable, and cash flow management becomes a guessing game.

Example:  
Emma, a freelance photographer, uses her personal debit card for both groceries and business-related camera equipment. When tax season arrives, she struggles to separate personal spending from business expenses. As a result, she overlooks legitimate tax deductions and loses money.

Solution: Open a dedicated business bank account and use accounting software (like QuickBooks or FreshBooks) to track income and expenses separately.

**2 Increased Risk of a tax Audit**

The tax authorities require businesses to keep clear, accurate records. If personal and business transactions are mixed, you may:

* Deduct personal expenses by mistake, leading to tax penalties.
* Miss out on legitimate business deductions, increasing your tax burden.
* Raise red flags with the tax bodies, resulting in an audit or fines.

Statistic:  
According to a SCORE study, 40% of small business owners spend over 80 hours per year managing their taxes—and that number increases if records are disorganized.

 Example:  
David, an online consultant, pays for a family dinner with his business account, thinking he’ll classify it as a business meal. However, since the dinner was not related to his business, a tax audit later reveals the mistake, resulting in a hefty fine.

Solution: Keep personal and business finances separate. Use a business credit card for all company expenses, and maintain digital receipts for documentation.

 

**3 Loss of Legal Protection (Piercing the Corporate Veil)**

If you operate as an LLC or Corporation, one of the biggest advantages is limited liability protection—meaning your personal assets (house, car, savings) are safe if your business faces legal action.

But if you mix personal and business finances, courts can argue that your business is not truly separate from you, leaving you personally liable for business debts and lawsuits.

Example:  
Sarah, the owner of a small tech startup, runs her LLC but frequently pays for personal expenses from her business account. When a legal dispute arises, the court rules that her business is not financially separate, putting her personal savings and property at risk.

Solution: Open a business checking account and avoid making personal purchases with business funds. This maintains your LLC or Corporation’s liability protection.

**4 Difficulty in Securing Business Loans & Investments**

Want to apply for a business loan or attract investors? Lenders and investors want to see clean financial records to assess your business’s stability.

If your finances are mixed, banks may reject your loan application or investors may question your business’s credibility.

Example:  
Mark runs a coffee shop and wants to expand to a second location. However, because his business transactions are mixed with personal expenses, his financial statements appear unorganized and unreliable, leading the bank to deny his loan request.

Solution: Keep separate financial records and ensure your business income and expenses are clear. Use a professional bookkeeper to maintain accurate statements.

**Best Practices for Separating Business and Personal Finances**

Now that you know the risks, here’s how to avoid these costly mistakes and stay financially organized:

**1 Open a Business Bank Account**

* Keeps personal and business transactions separate.
* Makes tax filing easier and more accurate.
* Helps track cash flow effectively.

Pro Tip: Most banks offer free or low-fee business checking accounts. Choose one that integrates with accounting software.

**2 Use a Business Credit Card**

* Builds business credit, making it easier to secure loans.
* Helps track business expenses without confusion.
* Many business cards offer cashback and rewards on business purchases.

Pro Tip: Use one business credit card for all business-related expenses.

**3 Pay Yourself a Salary**

* Ensures financial discipline.
* Keeps business and personal money separate.
* Helps with budgeting and tax planning.

Pro Tip: Set up a regular direct deposit from your business account to your personal account, rather than making random withdrawals.

**4 Use Accounting Software or Hire a Bookkeeper**

* Prevents manual errors and keeps records organized.
* Saves time and reduces tax stress.
* Helps you identify business trends and profitability.

Pro Tip: Use software like QuickBooks, Xero, or Wave, or hire a bookkeeping professional (like Tactic Bookkeeping) to keep your finances in check.

**5 Keep Receipts and Maintain Proper Records**

* Tax authorities requires businesses to keep records for tax purposes.
* Helps with audits and deductions.
* Prevents financial misunderstandings.

Pro Tip: Use apps like Expensify or Shoeboxed to digitize receipts and store them securely.

**Final Thoughts: Protect Your Business & Your Financial Future**

Mixing personal and business finances might seem like a minor mistake, but it can lead to legal liabilities, tax penalties, missed growth opportunities, and financial confusion.

By keeping clear financial records, using separate accounts, and leveraging professional bookkeeping services, you’ll protect your business, simplify tax season, and position yourself for long-term success.

1jellld,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1jellld/revisiting_the_past/,Revisiting the Past,"As I’m nearing my year, I’ve been taking some times to revisit my past posts. They started 4 years ago (I was 31 then). 

I came across this post:

“When I think about future vacations, camping/backpacking trips, or events... I get this little ball of sadness or denial - like I’m trying to convince myself that MAYBE I’ll be able to drink at those. And that’s one of my biggest problems because that little bit of denial shows me that I’m still not 100% there yet, but I desperately want to be. I don’t want to feel like I’ll miss out on life because I didn’t drink at things.

When I was a kid, my family had so many awesome vacations, camping tips, and events together and I had so much fun at them. And I remember them with so much clarity. I didn’t need to drink back then and it wasn’t even a thought (being a kid helps), and I really miss that aspect about life. 

I really wish that alcohol had never entered my life. Because these past ten years, though fun at times, has been full of anxiety and a downward spiral into alcoholism. And there’s a lot of trips and memories I look back on that are foggy or make me feel shameful.  They’re not clear memories.

I need to remind myself of how much fun I can have even without alcohol present. I need to remember those fun times I had as a kid who didn’t need to drink to make the best of my surroundings and experiences.

One thing I hope to do for my future children is to never glamorize alcohol or be drinking around them. I want them to see and adult who can enjoy things without having a glass in their hand.

I hope that I’ll learn to adapt back into having sober fun and enjoying everything for what it’s worth. And hopefully that little ball of denial will go away for good.”

This part stuck out to me: “And that’s one of my biggest problems because that little bit of denial shows me that I’m still not 100% there yet, but I desperately want to be.”

Something that I learned that was absolutely necessary for me to become sober was to accept sobriety into my life. I worried a lot about the “what ifs” during the first stages of my sobriety. I felt like I would miss out on moments and occasions and not have fun anymore. And I truly and deeply believed that. 

But I slowly began to realize that the pain, suffering, and anxiety in my life were directly caused by alcohol. This was physical AND mental pain. And those 1-5 hours of drinking on a couch, a stool, or standing at a kitchen island - those weren’t actually fun, it was all a façade put on by alcohol. I realized nothing was fun about living my days with crippling anxiety, deeply doomed midnight thoughts, and sneaking around behind my loved ones backs to put alcohol in me again. I couldn’t get through life without a buzz - or so I thought. I was living the most miserable life - all while thinking giving up alcohol would cause my life to be miserable. When you’re living miserably and relying on something you’ve convinced yourself takes misery away- you forget to realize what’s causing it or what’s making it feel even worse than it needs to. That was alcohol for me. 

I haven’t drank for 10+ months now. There have been plenty of times I have joined my friends or my SO at a bar and have sat there BORED OUT OF MY WITS. So bored I could cry. And it’s funny to me now - because I used to think doing that was so much fucking fun before. Sitting. Drinking. The reality is that it’s not that fun. Sitting at a bar, standing at a kitchen island, passing out on the couch - those are all incredibly mundane actions. Alcohol just made me stoked on the mundane. 

I’m not now climbing cliffs or running marathons - but I’ve picked back up my art both by hand and digital. I’m able to read again without passing out or forgetting how I got to the page I was on. I’m able to cook healthy meals and stay up late with a group of online friends I’ve met where we all chat and share interests (throw me a bone, I’m living in a new place and haven’t made real friends yet). 

I sleep through the nights, wake up with no anxiety (after my coffee too - yes coffee - I can’t drink that now)! I walk around without sweating or losing my breath. I don’t feel pain in the core of my gut anymore. My digestion is normal. I have genuinely laughed more this year than I have in the past few. I remember at my lowest point I thought it was impossible to laugh or to ever feel elation again - I do now. I don’t fear people getting to close to me at work because of the smell of alcohol. I don’t worry about having to drive when I need to drive. There’s a lot to be thankful for.

I have camped, gone to weddings, attended holidays, gone out of country, gone out with friends at night, attended concerts, flown, been the DD, done karaoke, explored new states, MOVED to a new state, tried new foods, gotten out of my comfort zone, celebrated milestones - my own milestones. And I’ve done that all sober. And you know what? I had fun. And each morning that I wake up I THANK myself from the day before for choosing not to drink. And I promise myself of tomorrow that I will take care of them today. And I repeat that.

I tried experimenting with no meat, cheese or milk (No animal products at all) for a little less than 2 weeks and it made me feel insane, I dont know how people are able to go vegan or vegetarian especially while trying to use peat principles. 

I had a severe lack of energy and mental focus and lost a lot of weight, Im not surprised by the results of doing this but It was still interesting to see how my body would react and I was curious about it.

It made me solidify my thoughts about vegan and vegetarian type life styles confirming that they are not sufficient for proper health and all around well being.

Breakfast - Oatmeal apple and orange + black coffee

Lunch - White rice & a fruit and rice cakes 

Dinner - Cooked potato & Pea soup or vegetable soup

I was curious if anyone else has tried something similar to this and if they could share their experiences doing it in the reply’s.

1jel8ch,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/comments/1jel8ch/every_month_my_roommates_perform_a_disturbing/,"Every month, my roommates perform a disturbing ritual. I am always the sacrifice.","It began around a month ago. 

I started losing time. Long stretches of time, whether it was night or day. 

I’d go to class or to the library to study, and suddenly wake up at home. 

I thought it was stress-related or maybe health-related, so I went to see the campus doctor. 

He just prescribed me sleeping pills. 

He asked me questions about my diet and lifestyle, as if that had anything to do with the fact that I was blacking out for hours at a time with no recollection of what I had been doing.

It was the same every time. 

I woke up in bed with a gnawing hunger in my gut, like I hadn’t eaten in weeks, and no memory of how I got there.

The thing with them wasn’t too crazy at first. I mean, it was just something I noticed. 

For reasons which baffled me, the three of them were suddenly sensitive to the moon.

And I don’t mean that it caused them headaches or nausea. I mean it affected them in ways which didn’t make sense.

Have you ever heard of the Transylvania Effect?

According to Discovery Magazine:

“In the dark sky, the clouds shift, revealing the full moon’s eerie silver gleam, and the people on Earth below go mad.”

I wouldn’t have called it going mad, but something was wrong with them.

Different.

And it’s always the full moon that triggers it. Which made me wonder if it was, in fact, the Transylvania Effect.

I first noticed it at Abigail Matheson’s house party. The party was nothing special, really. 

I didn’t drink that much that night. 

The point is, I can’t blame what I saw on being drunk.

I know perception can be misinterpreted and messed up when you’ve had one too many canned Strawberry Daiquiris, but I was completely sober.

And I was planning on staying that way until we left.

I remember the night in clarity. I’m not a fan of crowds, so I lingered in Abigail’s kitchen playing around on my phone.

I only knew Abigail Matheson from Rowan and Immie. They were in the same classes.

I needed to find something to occupy my mind or I was going to die of boredom.

Most of the party was in the living room playing Mario Kart. 

I was refilling my glass when I glimpsed Immie’s familiar blonde ponytail bouncing through straggling students grinding against each other.

The party wasn’t costume-themed, but Immie insisted on wearing a baby blue ribbon in her hair, which reminded me of a grown Disney character.

Imogen Prairie was the human embodiment of a golden retriever.

She is as adorable as she is naïve and is always smiling no matter the situation.

I lifted my drink in greeting, about to shout her name, but then I saw the expression on her face.

She looked… wary.

No, that’s not the word. 

I can’t describe her expression because I couldn’t understand it myself. 

For once, Imogen wasn’t smiling. Her eyes were wide, lips twitching into a scowl.

Her movements were erratic as she headed into the kitchen, grabbing a glass of punch and downing it before striding towards the back window and pulling the blinds shut.

Rowan, roommate number two, was right behind her.

They were talking in hushed whispers, their heads pressed together before Rowan noticed me.

Rowan was what you would call pretentious cute.

Usually dressed in trench coats, his party outfit was oddly normal.

Shirt and jeans, a loose pair of glasses sitting on top of unruly brown curls.

Rowan Beck resembled what *he* called a ‘normie’.

He fixed me with what I can only describe as a patient smile. “Nin! Have you seen Kaz?”

The copious amounts of lemonade I’d been drinking all night started to crawl back up my throat.

His tone was different. Darker. Nothing like I knew.

That was the first night I noticed something was wrong with him.

“Huh?” I said stupidly. “Kaz?”

Rowan raised a brow. “Yep. Kazzzz.” He dragged out the Z. “The guy you *live* with. Have you seen him anywhere?”

“I don't think so.” I caught his sharp glance at the blinds. “Rowan, are you… okay?”

The man's gaze snapped to me. 

“I'm peachy.”

Rowan leaned against the table, his expression darkening. 

I sensed the desperation emitting from him, but it didn’t make sense. 

Was Kaz in trouble? 

And why were they keeping it between them? What were we, little kids? 

His expression was sour, like he couldn't bear talking to me. 

“Did Kaz by any chance… I don't know,” he tapped out a tune on the countertop. “Mayyyybeee go outside?”

Our third roomie had been MIA since the four of us walked in earlier. 

He made a comment about going to talk to a guy he was crushing on before disappearing into the crowd. 

I hadn’t seen him since. Which was very unlike Kaz. 

When it comes to games, or anything playable, he’s a competitive bastard. 

I expected him to be in the living room with the others, slamming buttons like his life depended on it. Instead, he was nowhere to be seen. 

I opened my mouth to speak, when Immie stuck her head through the gap in the door. 

“He’s fine!” Immie said, a streak of panic in her tone. 

She shooed me back when I started forwards. “We’ve got this. Kaz is just, uh, well, he's doing Kaz stuff.”

“Kaz *stuff*?”

“Yeah!” Imogen’s smile was a little too big. “Like I said, we’ve got this.”

“Have we?” Rowan snapped. He raked his fingernails down his face. “How do you lose a 23 year old guy?”

Immie scowled, throwing a cup in his face. 

“He told me he was going to the bathroom.” She said, “It’s not like I could follow him.”

Rowan tossed a cup right back at her. “In these circumstances, yes, you should have followed him!” 

Lowering his voice, Rowan pulled her closer. But I still heard him. “He could *drown!* What did I tell you about keeping the idiot away from the pool?” 

Imogen scoffed. “I'm sorry, how is that fair? Why don't *you* babysit?”

“You offered.”

“Yeah, not for the whole night!”

Their argument was barely registering. 

*Drown?*

“Nin. You stay here.” Immie grabbed a reluctant Rowan’s arm.  “We’ll go get him.”

I nodded with a smile, but that didn’t stop me following them. 

I made it to the front door, almost tripping over myself. 

The party continued behind me, laughter, and giddy screaming from the living room. 

In front of me, however, was something entirely different from the party. 

The front door was wide open, and the night sky bled inside the house. 

My three roommates  stood on the threshold, their heads tipped back, eyes on the night sky, and the full moon bathing the dark in unearthly light. 

I’ve looked this phenomenon up, and it can be called “Moon drunk” but this had never happened before. 

I had lived with them for two years, and this was the first time they were entranced by the moon of all things. 

Kaz was in front of the others, and I glimpsed a can of beer at his feet spilling its contents onto rough concrete.

At first, I thought they were marvelling the sight. I mean, it was beautiful enough to stare at and smile, maybe comment on it or take a photo. 

""Hey."" I clapped my hands in Rowan's face. ""What's going on?"" 

He didn't even blink. 

Moving to Immie and Kaz, I shook them. 

Still nothing. 

They did move… eventually. 

“See.” Rowan’s voice was almost a breath, his gaze still on the sky. “We’ve found him.”

When the music stopped, they came back to life, ignoring me, and bound back into the party with no explanation to what the hell had just happened.

“Moon drunk” was starting to make the most sense.  

I got my answer when I went back inside, and Kaz was raiding the refrigerator. 

I didn’t think much of it until I saw pieces of raw bacon squelching between his fingers and stringy white sticking from his mouth. 

Now, there’s getting the munchies, and there’s willingly stuffing yourself with raw bacon. 

“Kaz?”

The boy twisted around so fast, almost inhuman. 

Kaz slowly inclined his head, bacon fat caught between his teeth. 

There was a feral look in his eyes, which told me if I even attempted to stop him from feasting on raw pork, I’d lose a finger.  

His gaze tracked me like a predator, before turning back to his meal. 

I left him to whatever *that* was. 

Immie, who hadn’t paid attention to a guy since freshman year when she was assaulted at a party, was sitting in a random guy’s lap, her lips latched to his ear. 

It was Immie who looked to be the one in control, but even being moon drunk, I didn’t want her anywhere near a guy. 

Not when she was still in therapy. 

Before I could intervene, my housemate was yanking the guy to his feet in one pull and dragging him upstairs.

To my shock, though, it was the guy who pulled away from her. “What the fuck?” He hissed, “Get off me!”

Immie didn’t seem fazed. She just offered him a smile and walked away, this time plonking herself in a girls lap.

It was strange behavior, considering Kaz was a vegetarian, and Imogen was terrified of intimacy.

Rowan was acting, objectively, the least weird. I found him in the kitchen staring into his drink.

When I tried talking to him, he responded with one-word answers, his gaze glued to whatever was so fucking fascinating about his glass of diet coke. 

Was it a dead fly? 

“Rowan.”

I followed him around, trying to snap him out of it. 

“Hm?” His voice was almost sing-song. 

“Rowan!”

He twisted around, doing a little dance, half lidded eyes struggling to take me in. 

“Whaaaaaat?!”

I tried to keep my patience. 

“Did you know your best friend is currently gnawing on raw pig?”

I regretted my words ten seconds after saying them. 

This guy was going to be *zero* help. 

“Uhmmm, soooo?” Rowan settled me with a childish grin. “You know what you are, Nin?”

I didn't answer, already expecting a stupid answer. 

Rowan threw a plastic cup at me. *”Cuphead.”*

Comedic genius. 

“What the fuck is going on?” I hissed, only for him to lean forward, and blow in my face. 

“Do you like chicken *tenders*?” He asked, before bursting into childlike giggles. 

Rowan spent the rest of the evening aimlessly walking around with a stupid smile on his face. 

He called me *Cuphead* for three hours straight. 

All three of them had that same mystified grin and I couldn't snap them out of it. 

After the party, I noticed the following full-moon they seemed to go 0-100 in terms of personality changes. 

Kaz would spontaneously decide to go visit his parents in another state for no reason. 

Rowan was obsessed with blocking every window to avoid moonlight spilling in, and insisted the whole house had to be protected with duct tape covering every window and reflective surface. 

As for me, I was locked inside my room with the curtains drawn—forced to wear headphones with music playing. 

There was only one rule I had to follow, and when I questioned it, I just got the same answer from all three. “Trust us.” 

They wanted me to trust them when Kaz was gnawing on raw meat like an animal, Immie was throwing herself at random guys and girls, and Rowan went into a trance-like state when he caught sight of anything reflective.

I understood the moon was affecting them in ways I couldn’t understand. 

But locking me in my room until the morning was over-kill. 

I was the only one who wasn’t affected by the moon’s light, and yet they treated me like I was in trouble too.

Despite being overly reluctant, I agreed to their rules. I stayed in my room and listened to music as loud as it would go. 

According to them, I couldn’t at any point remove my headphones. 

After playing half of my Spotify playlist, I drifted off. Before I knew what was happening, I was waking up with sunlight poking through the blinds,  feeling like shit, a gnawing hunger in my gut which splintered into nausea. 

There were differences that jumped out at me when I pried my eyes open, blinking through intense sunlight.

I was wearing different clothes. 

I remembered I’d changed into a shirt and shorts for bed, but I was dressed for the day. 

I didn’t remember drinking anything before falling asleep, but an empty glass was on my bedside.

Except mouth was parched, my lips dry.

I didn’t question it. I wanted to, but anything was possible.

Maybe I was the delusional one. 

I was blacking out, so maybe I dressed myself without knowing, and then slipped downstairs and grabbed a drink of water in the early morning.

After that night, things seemed to go back to normal. 

I decided that it really was a case of being moon-drunk. 

The others didn’t talk about it again, and life went on, I guess.

I thought about talking about it with them, but when I tried, they would stiffen up or change the subject. 

Rowan would completely shut me down, and Kaz acted like I had a contagious disease. 

I asked Immie if anything happened, and she screwed up her face and jumped up with an excuse that she needed to go somewhere. 

Kaz dismissed everything I said and told me they were fine, and that the moon just “gave them headache”.

I can be an idiot sometimes, but I was pretty sure eating raw bacon like an animal couldn’t be justified with that excuse. 

When I tried to argue, he grabbed the controller from a sleeping Rowan, and dared me to fuck up Immie’s island. 

I did, swiftly ending up covered in Rowan’s breakfast the next morning.

So, basically, my roommates  were hiding something big from me, and I wasn’t planning on telling them about the blackouts.

Because part of me wondered if they were involved. 

I was convinced the two phenomenons were linked.

So, yeah, a pretty toxic mindset to have on both sides.

Anyway, this leads me to what happened last night.

It was the usual– the usual I had gotten used to, anyway. 

After class, I hurried home to help with prepping the house for the full moon. 

Rowan was standing on a chair, taping up the windows, and Immie was closing all the curtains and blinds. 

He was being an asshole as usual, so I busied myself with hiding everything reflective I could find, before retiring to the living room and joining Kaz who was working on his laptop. 

Immie and Rowan were hard to talk to about what was going on, but with Kaz being the resident stoner, his walls came down a little. 

I slumped down on our Craigslist couch and grabbed a controller, resuming a game of COD from earlier. 

“So.” I focused on the game, navigating my first-person character through a pile of bodies.

Kaz offered me a smile over his laptop. He reeked of weed. 

“Soo..?”

“Are you ever planning on telling me what’s going on?”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“The moon.” I said. “It’s moon night, and as usual everyone’s freaking out.”

“Freaking out?” Kaz’s gaze strayed on his laptop screen. “I’m the epitome of calm right now.”

I threw a cushion at him. “You’re stoned. And I’m still waiting for you to explain your spontaneous Peppa Pig binge.”

He tossed me a sheepish smile. “I was hungry.”

“You’re a vegetarian!” I said, immediately remembering Rowan’s moon-drunk state. 

“Rowan was… *giggling*.” I whispered. “It was… oh god, I'm still having nightmares.”

He laughed. “Okay, he was definitely replaced.”

“Or you *both* were.” 

Kaz shrugged. “We’ve already told you. It’s just sensitivity. The moon can do shit like that. Look it up.”

“Sensitivity.” I repeated in a scoff, glaring at war-torn Europe on the TV screen. “That’s what you’re calling it?”

Kaz lifted his head, his gaze snapping to me. “What else do you want to call it?”

I took a deep breath. I had some guesses.  

“Werewolf?”

He curled his lip, but I noticed his eyes darken significantly. 

“Very… original. Ten points for creativity.”

“Werewolves freak out every full moon.” I said. 

He nodded, humoring me as he typed. Kaz was like an older brother. “Uh-huh. They're also not real.”

“It’s not that far-fetched!""

Kaz stopped typing, raising a brow. “I’m pretty sure humans can’t turn into dogs under the full moon. You've been watching too many movies.” 

He shot me a look. “Weren't you like, *really* into Teen Wolf?” 

I put the controller down. “You lock me in my room until morning.” I twisted to face him. “How is that normal?”

“It’s just a precaution. You’ve told us how weird we act, so it’s better to stay away from us.”

“I’d feel better if I was with you.” I swallowed. “So, I know what’s really going on.”

Kaz’s expression seemed to change, relaxing slightly. He looked like he might reply, before Rowan came crashing in. Quite literally. 

That guy can’t walk two feet without falling or slamming into something. 

In this case, he tripped over the rug Immie had been vacuuming. 

I blamed the moon’s influence on him being more hyperactive than normal. 

Rowan oozed ADHD. 

Stumbling into the back of the couch, he grasped onto the back to stable himself. “What are you guys talking about?”

Kaz went back to typing with an exaggerated sigh. “Nin thinks we’re werewolves.”

Rowan straightened up with a very nervous laugh. “What?”

“Werewolves.” Kaz shut his laptop. 

“You know, people who can turn into dogs? Honestly, I’m offended. I thought Nin was more creative than that. There’s a whole Wikipedia page on moon afflicted creatures, and she goes with the obvious.”

“Oh, um, wowwwww.” Rowan chuckled. “Teen Wolf style?”

Kaz grinned. “TV show or 1980’s movie?”

“Doesn’t matter.” Rowan started clearing up the TV table, flipping through comic books.  “They both suck.”

“What sucks?” Immie yelled from the kitchen.

“Teen Wolf!” Rowan yelled back.

The girl made a sound of horror, and it was hard to hide my smile. 

“Take that back!”

“It’s bad.” Rowan said, loud enough for her to hear. “You forced me to watch an episode, and I fell asleep.”

“That was after season 3!” Immie appeared in the doorway, wielding a spoon like she was going to attack him.

Gesturing wildly with the spoon, Immie was desperate to defend her lockdown guilty pleasure.

“After season three it declined in quality. But it was still good! You liked the episode with the chess game!”

Rowan shrugged. “That doesn’t change my overall rating.”

“Who are you, IGN?” Immie turned and marched back into the kitchen and slammed the door.

It took maybe an hour for the two of them to get back on her good side.

See, I think about these moments, and I wonder why I’m writing this post.

I think I’m still in denial. I want to tell you thousands of reasons why they’re not bad people.

But then I remember what happened after that. I remember why I can’t talk to anyone else but an anonymous subreddit.

At around 10PM I found myself once again in my room going through the same routine.

This time, though, they wanted to be extra careful. Which meant a new addition to make sure I stayed there until dawn.

Rowan knelt in front of me. I couldn’t see the look in his eyes through his raybans, but I could tell he was wary.

“You okay?” He fixed the headphones over my ears, jiggling them a little to make sure they were fitted properly.

I tugged at the handcuffs securing my left hand to the bed frame. “Kinky.” 

“It’s just until morning, Nin.""

“Handcuffs, though?” I said. “Are they really necessary?”

He didn’t answer. “Remember what you have to do?”

""Music on and blasting until I fall asleep.”

""And?""

""And I'm not coming out until morning.""

Rowan hummed. “Lastly?”

“Don’t remove the headphones.”

He jumped up. “All right! Are you all set?”

“Sure.” I tried to smile. “I’ve got enough 80’s pop and sad indie to last me a while.”

“Awesome.”

I tugged at the cuffs. “Rowan, if something is going on, you can tell me.”

He didn't turn around. ""Really? Because, no offence, but I don’t think a pep talk will help.”

“Well, I can try.” I said. “I don’t want to be locked up here every full moon because you’re scared of moonlight.”

I was startled when he sputtered out a laugh before getting close—too close—his icy breath grazing my cheeks.

“Well.” Rowan murmured, “Maybe if you weren’t a coward that day, things might be different. But here we are, Nin,"" He flicked me on the nose. 

""Drunk on the fucking moon."" He exhaled in my face, and something warm crept up my throat. 

“Quite literally.”

“Are you a werewolf, Rowan?” I blurted. 

His entire demeanour changed suddenly. I felt him stiffen. 

I was used to his bad moods before the moon, but this was something different. 

This was hatred and resentment in its purest form shown in the twitch of his lips. 

I didn’t have to see his eyes. 

His smile through gritted teeth told me everything.

Slowly, Rowan tipped his head to the side, like he was feigning innocence. “What gave you *that* idea?”

Before I could reply, he climbed off the bed and offered me a two fingered salute, his lips twisting into a grin I knew was fake.

It made me wonder if I was wrong.

If the moon didn’t change them, instead bringing out their true feelings and selves. 

But that only brought more questions. 

He mentioned “that day” which was part of the endless blur of darkness, memories torn from me in my blackouts. 

Did something happen during one of those instances which had triggered them to act like this? 

With that question in my mind, I attempted to lunge from the restraints, but he was already at the door. 

“Night.""

I didn’t reply. 

I knew not to entertain him when he was starting to feel the moon’s effects.

When the door slammed shut and I heard the twist of the key in the lock, I lay back and closed my eyes.

I considered tearing off the headphones and ignoring the rules, but that seemed petty.

Plus, I was tired.

I drifted off to music slamming in my ears. I still don’t know how I slept through it. 

I don’t know how long I was out for, but it couldn’t have been long. 

A few hours. 

I woke up feeling ravenously hungry, and yet hollow at the same time.

When I sat up, I noticed something felt… wrong. 

I frowned at my toes for way longer than necessary until I realized one was missing. 

*I was supposed to have five toes on each foot*, my foggy mind murmured. 

I counted them twice, but there were only four. My pinkie toe was gone. 

After staring at it for a while, I blinked, and I could have sworn it appeared in flashes, like the flesh was knitting itself back together. I was seeing things. 

That’s what I told myself. 

Sleep paralysis was a thing, so I waited until I was fully with it, and when I was, my mind began to drink in my surroundings. The room was still dark, only lit up by my bedside lamp. 

I was in different clothes once more, and an empty glass of water stood on my bed stand. 

Something was different though. 

It was still dark outside, and I could just about glimpse a sliver of moonlight poking through the blinds.

Another thing which was different: My hand was no longer cuffed to my bed frame.

Sitting up, I stretched, and headed to the door. It wouldn’t hurt to peek, I thought.

I reached out and grabbed the handle and twisted it, only for the door to swing open.

Weird. Wasn’t it locked?

They probably had some weird ritual to keep the moon out which Kaz found on Yahoo Answers.

Far too embarrassing for me to see.

Slowly, I made my way across the hall and passed the others rooms which were all silent. Which meant they were downstairs.

If I was honest with myself, I really didn’t want to deal with them if they were under the moon’s effects, but the rest of me was desperate to know what they had been hiding. 

Why was I sentenced to my room until dawn? 

The clock on rustic paintwork told me it was 1am as I slipped down the stairs, careful not to make noise. That meant I’d been asleep for around four hours. 

I heard voices when I reached the kitchen door. Immie was laughing, and Rowan made a hissing noise.

“That’s not fair. You always get the blue ones first and never give anyone a chance. I call bullshit.”

“Yeah, because you’re losing!” Immie shot back.

“Rowan’s right, though.” Kaz joined in. “You do act territorial over Park Place and Boardwalk.”

“I do not!”

“At least give someone else a chance to get the blue ones, Immie.”

“Why? I got them fair and square! You’re just calling me out because you’ve got—”

“Hey!” Rowan yelled. “Hey, she can’t just do that!”

“Two hundred dollars left.” Immie sang. “And you’re stuck in jail. I rest my case.”

Huh. They were playing Monopoly without me. So, they locked me in my room and played games till dawn?

That stung a little.

I could have walked away. I mean, they were having fun. I should have left them to tear themselves apart over a board game.

But I was grabbing the handle and twisting it, pulling open the door.

When I stepped into our kitchen, the first thing I saw was the impressive amount of property cards Immie had lain out in front of her. As well as the pile of cash sitting next to the board. 

I started to speak. 

I think I was going to congratulate Immie on her clear win.

But the words choked up when my gaze continued across the table. 

This time settling on a small plastic container filled with red mush, which Kaz was sticking his fingers in and scooping into his mouth. 

The kitchen looked so familiar and yet different as my brain struggled to react with what I was seeing. 

Immie’s face was split into a manic grin because of her win, but there was something splattered on her lips and dripping from her chin. 

It wasn’t Immie I was looking at. 

It was what was in front of her, spread out like a main course, what she was tearing at like an animal.  

What was hanging out of Kaz’s mouth in slithering strands dyed scarlet and piled on Rowan’s plate. 

I was seeing flesh covering the table and them—and the floor. 

And they were stuffing themselves.

I thought it was raw chicken at first and had decided at that moment that they really had lost their minds. 

Then, though, I saw what was lying at their feet. I saw the torso first, which had been torn into, guts spilling out onto the floor. 

The body was an unrecognizable mass of skinned bone and pooling scarlet before I saw the face, and clumps of hair which had been ragged from the skull. 

I recognised that dirty blonde ponytail. Unbelievably, I was staring at myself. 

I was ahead of my brain at that moment. 

I was already seeing everything for what it was in a hazy red cloud, and my brain could do nothing.

It was me they were eating.

They were ripping me apart—gnawing on my bones.

Stuffing my guts into a plastic container and using me as dip.

I was paralysed. I looked at the window, at the duct tape blocking out the moon’s light.

So, this wasn’t an effect of the moon.

This was them.

This was all THEM.

Immie was the first to notice me. 

Her smile dampened, and she dropped what looked like stringy pieces of intestine clenched between her fists. 

My roommate's eyes widened, and for a moment she looked like she was on the edge of hysteria. 

“Nin!” she squeaked, the mushy mess of guts slipping from her hands. 

“Hey! Uh, this…. this—”

The girl was struggling. 

Her eyes snapped to my body which had been hollowed out and cut into pieces on the floor.

Then, to Rowan’s plate filled with a red mush of blended whatever.

And whatever the fuck Kaz was sticking his fingers in. 

“This...isn’t what it looks like.” Kaz finished for her. He stood up, seeming calmer than the others.

Rowan was staring at me. 

His raybans pinned back dark curls, and his eyes didn’t seem angry or even fazed that I was seeing this. They only regarded me with amusement. 

Like he *wanted* me to find this. He looked torn whether to continue chewing on my flesh or try to explain.

“Nin.” Immie jumped up. “We can explain.” She whispered. “Or… or we can’t explain right now, but if you just let us—”

“Let us what?” Rowan scoffed. “Explain? Yeah, we’re way past that point. Do you want to try explaining café de Nin?”

He pointed to his chin. “You’ve got a little of her small intestine there.”

“What?” Immie shot me a look, swiping at her chin with her sleeve. “Nin, ignore him!”

I don’t remember my legs moving, but I was at the front door before I could release a breath.

They followed me, their thundering footsteps pounding behind me.

Now they were scared.

When I was so close to the door, so close to letting in that unearthly light, their expression’s turned fearful.

“Nin.” Kaz swiped blood from his mouth and chin.  “Don’t open that fucking door.”

Immie wrapped her arms around herself. “Is she here?”

“No.” Rowan grumbled, shading his eyes. “And she won’t come, as long as that door stays shut.”

I found my voice. “Who are you talking about?”

“Nobody.” Kaz said. “Just go back upstairs. We’ll explain. I promise you. But you have to trust us.”

His tone was a warning.

“Trust you?!” I managed to get out. “Are you fucking kidding me?”

It was funny.

How they wanted me to trust them when I saw what they had done to me.

I couldn’t speak, couldn’t breathe. 

I didn’t want an explanation or a scuffed excuse. I wanted out of there.

The rest is a sort of blur. I remember opening the door. 

Or at least I started to open it, and then I shut it again, panicking.

Their cries were enough to make me regret it. 

But it was too late. 

I watched their eyes fill up with that same unearthly light which bathed the sky. 

It was beautiful and terrifying the way their resolve crumbled in their eyes and lips. 

Scowls turned to whimsical smiles, and blood stained hands fell to their sides. 

The three of them headed back into the kitchen, and a sudden rhythmic knock on the front door startled me. 

I remember Rowan at the corner of my eye, rummaging around in a draw. 

Immie and Kaz stood behind him.

I risked going to the window and peeking out, but all I saw was the moon. 

The moon was right there, three inches from my face like it had encased the sky and oblivion beyond. For a moment I was taken aback at how beautiful she was. 

There she was bathing me in her light, in her glow, filling me with her song and her sweet words. And then a thud sounded behind me. 

Whatever had leached onto my mind let go, and I twisted to find Rowan on the ground in a rapidly growing pool of red. 

Her voice was in his head. Just like it was in mine. Another thud, and then another, almost in sync. Kaz and Immie followed. 

Their throats had been slit by their own fingernails fashioned into claws. 

When it hit me that my roommates  were dead, I was seeing her reflection in everything. 

In silverware which had been brought out from the draws—bleeding through the duct tape on the back window. 

I knew what I had to do.

 I had to get the cops. 

I was halfway upstairs when a blinding flash filled the hallway, followed by the sound. It sounded like a camera, like someone was taking a photo. 

When I grabbed my phone from my room, the moon lingered on the screen, growing larger until I swore she wasn’t just in reflective surfaces. 

She was at the corner of my eye, a half crescent quickly reaching totality the more I caught her shadow looming.

It was like a game she was playing. The more I caught her light, she only grew bigger.

After a hysterical freak-out with the cops, they came 5 minutes later.

Two officers followed me inside the house, one of them asking how many people were dead.

“Three.” I kept saying. “My roommates .” I was speaking in barely decipherable sobs. “My roommates  are dead.

When I led them into the kitchen, however, bracing myself for the gory aftermath of what I saw, I was greeted by the three of them sitting on the floor, resuming their game of Monopoly. 

My body, as well as every piece of me was fucking gone.

The blood pooling on the floor, as well as staining their skin and faces—was gone.

“Officers.” Rowan saluted the cops with his drink. I noticed a glitter of light in his eyes, in Kaz’s when he stood and folded his arms, his lips pulling into a smile. 

“What’s going on?” He shot a look at me. “Nin, come on. We’re in the middle of a game.”

The officer standing behind me frowned. 

“We were informed of a triple homicide.” He cleared his throat. “Everything seems to be relatively normal.”  

Stepping in front of me, he was scowling. 

“Miss Caine, are you aware that wasting police time is a criminal offence?”

“They were dead.” I said in a hiss. “I saw them. They were dead!""

“Uh-huh.” The second officer sighed, turning to Kaz.

“Is your friend under the influence of drugs?”

“Or too many scary movies?” The other scoffed.

Rowan jumped up. “Uh, nope! No, we’re all good, officer!” 

When he came over and grabbed my arm, his grasp was strangely gentle. 

When I was leaning into it, however, I glimpsed something on his neck. At first I thought it was a tattoo, but it was engraved into his flesh. 

The number 2. 

“She’s not feeling great.” He said. “We, uh, we apologize for any crap caused.”

The cops didn’t say a word when they left, only muttering to each other about “stupid kids”.

I couldn’t face my roommates  after that. I went upstairs and splashed water on my face.

I was seeing things, I told myself.

I was going fucking crazy.

But then my fingers found the back of my neck, and I was twisting around, something acidic creeping up my throat.

Rowan’s neck displayed the number 2.

While mine had the number 27.

I went to bed after that. 

I was all ready to grab my things and leave while they slept, but when I risked standing on the top of the stairs, Kaz was in front of the door. 

It didn’t look like he was blocking it intentionally, but I wasn’t going to try.

This morning was awkward. That’s the only word I can think of to describe it.

My roommates  acted like nothing was wrong, like nothing happened. 

When I asked if the police had come back, Immie frowned at me over her oatmeal she hadn’t touched. 

“Police?” Her eyes grew wide. “Wait, did something happen last night?”

I was waiting for her to eat it, but she was just staring at it like it was sentient. 

I thought back to last night, watching her chewing through a mouthful of me, and I felt sick to my stomach.

“Doubt it.” Rowan had his back to me, making coffee. “All I remember is passing out after Monopoly.”

“After you lost.” Immie coughed. 

“Last night doesn’t count.” 

Kaz grabbed a seat next to me. “As far as we know, moon sensitivityTM didn’t get us, and Rowan let Imogen win Monopoly. Nin stayed in her room, and we survived another full moon.” 

He smiled. “Cheers to that.”

“Hey, Nin.” Rowan pushed past me when he took his plate to the dishwasher. “If anyone knocks today, don’t fucking answer it.”

I noticed Immie stiffen up.

Kaz’s smile faded.

“Understand?” Rowan said. “Shut off all the lights.”

With no explanation, the others left for class after breakfast, and I planned my escape.

I wanted to pack up all my stuff, but instead I found myself scouring their rooms for anything which would confirm last night was real,  and I hadn’t fucking hallucinated it. 

But their rooms were exactly how I knew them. 

Immie’s was a total mess, covered in exotic plants she forgot to water, textbooks, a whole bookshelf dedicated to the horror genre, and every plushie you could think of. 

I looked under her bed, though there were just old snacks she’d forgotten to throw away and letters to her parents she had never sent.

I tried Rowan’s next, but it was more or less the same. 

I knew his room from movie nights I spent with him, though it still felt wrong going in there. Rowan’s room was perfect. Everything was in its place and was strangely symmetrical. 

His books were color coded and there was one singular Yoda plushie peeking from his bed covers. 

Under his bed were the usual things you’d find in a man’s room: Used tissues and odd socks. 

But there was nothing I’d consider weird.

Nothing that told me he was a cold blooded murderer.

I was losing motivation when I reached Kaz’s room at the end of the hallway. 

I expected the usual when I stepped inside, movie posters on the walls, and Japanese snacks littering the floor. 

There was that, of course. I knew Kaz well. 

But when I peeked under his bed, there was something wrapped in plastic. 

When I crawled further under, I saw through the plastic. I saw the same flesh from last night, pieces of torso and limbs ripped through and torn into. 

But there wasn’t just one of me. 

There were multiple mutilated bodies which all had my face squished against the plastic and pooling red. 

My cannibalised body stuffed into trash bags, my own dead eyes staring at me. 

My mind flashed back to the blinding light filling the hallway, and the sound of a photograph being taken.  

The moon following me, creeping behind me as I made my getaway upstairs to grab my phone to call the cops. 

My pinkie toe growing back right in front of my eyes. 

I know this sounds fucking crazy, but I think my roommates  are copying me.

That’s what the 27 means. I’ve been copied 27 times.

Copied. Cloned. Whatever.

So they can eat me.

I am yet to go back home as I’m writing this. I’m planning to go back and get my stuff, but right now I can’t.

I want to blame all of this on them, but I keep thinking back to Rowan’s words.

“That night” I was a coward and left them, and somehow, these are the consequences.

What did I do to turn them into this? Rowan said this is my fault. It’s driving me crazy that I can’t remember it.

How can I get those memories back?

But do I want them back? 

Do I want to know what turned my roommates into this?",3,1742346221.0,ByfelsDisciple,0,0.81,False

Please help,"Hi all, I have my surgery tomorrow and I've been following my liquid diet all day, I got home at around 7:30 and decided to have a protein shake before reading my pre- surgery paperwork and taking my shower and using the Chlorhexidine Gluconate Cloths they gave me.

Immediately after finishing my protein shake at 8:15 I got to the part in my paperwork that says I'm not supposed to have anything other than sips of water and black coffee after 5:00pm. I'm absolutely devastated to have messed up so carelessly before something so important.

Does anyone know if this will cause my surgery to have to be postponed? I have called the hospital and messaged my doctor in my patient portal to try and make sure everything will be okay but nothing back yet. My surgery starts at 11am and I'm honestly considering trying to throw up the protein shake to try and rectify this. I'm so horrified I've been trying so hard to get to this day and do everything right. 

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your kind and reassuring words! I got a call back from my surgeon's partner and let him know what happened. He wasn't worried at all thank goodness.

He said it should definitely be out of my system by the time my surgery starts like you all said and I shouldn't have any issues, just sip some water until midnight to help move it along. I feel so much better after hearing that from him and all of you and taking a hot shower. I'll be turning into bed soon and I hope I can sleep tonight, I'm just buzzing with nervous energy and a touch of excitement. ",5,1742346220.0,GastricBypass,22,0.78,False
1jel8ag,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1jel8ag/my_neighbors_cat_keeps_growing_pt_2/,My Neighbors Cat Keeps Growing Pt 2,"one night I got up to get my usual snack a lot later, around 1:30am, when I passed by the glass door. there was a night light in another room that I could see in the reflection of the glass, and when I saw the blink of the outdoors, I noticed the cat in the lamp glow, sitting at the small pond on our property line, which would've been about 30 feet from the lamp itself. the shadowy cat appeared to be drinking from the pond water, which I didn't think much of until a minute or two later. that pond water must be rancid as hell, it's not like anyone ever cleans it... then as I was pouring a bowl of cereal, I started thinking back to the cat. the cat must have been a solid 50 feet or even more from the house, it was on the other side of the lamp post where the pond was, after all. but I could still see the cat well enough to see it drinking from the pond... there's no way I should've been able to see it that clearly from where I was. I finished pouring the cereal, and i quickly put it up and grabbed the bowl to head back to the glass door in the mudroom. I didn't see the cat this time, but that's not exactly surprising, maybe it just moved. still, I couldn't help but think more about it as I ate my cereal in my room just minutes later. I turned on my sleep aid playlist and tried to go to bed, visions of the blink i managed to see the cat played over in my mind like it was a rewind moment in a sports broadcast.

the next day went normally, I would occasionally think back to the sight of the cat in the dark, but it seemed way more normal when I would think of it, maybe I was just thinking it weird at the time. I'm sure I just was seeing things, I mean it *was* late at night after all.

several months went by and my family was hosting a birthday party for one of my cousins, the party was taking place outside until the wind started picking up. it must have been an hour or two before we all headed inside, after somebody's mostly empty plate got knocked off the table. I remember one of my uncles brought his dog to the function, and a few of my littler cousins were playing with the neighbor's dogs in the yard. they were the last ones out, they just didn't want to stop playing.

only about 30 minutes went by and I started glancing out the window as a habit from the living room we were eating in. every so often I'd see one of my cousins chase a Frisbee to the other side of the yard where I could see them in the window, but besides that I wouldn't really notice anything. then, maybe 15 minutes later, I saw the cat making his way back from the wooded area that was still part of our property but it was maybe a quarter mile back behind the main backyard. he was there, and he was *definitely* still... big. I'm aware of the Maine coon breed, and I've seen internet videos of really big cats who were just overweight tabbies, but I'd never seen a cat like that. it wasn't acting out of the ordinary, and I tried to make myself believe I was simply experiencing a wild optical illusion. I even tried moving my head a little to both sides to really make sure there wasn't anything weird going on with my sightline, but then I stopped so the other people in the room didn't see my obviously trying to see something outside, because then I'd have to make up a lie or try to explain what I was seeing.

the cat was approaching some farm equipment we keep in one spot right by the chicken coop. I admittedly had stopped thinking much about the bigness of the feline, until it rubbed up against one of the handlebars that I knew was about a good few feet off the ground. as I witnessed it rub a little bit of it's undercarriage over the equipment, I was sprang back into my anxiety. there was still a few kids in the yard, dogs too but I admittedly wasn't as worried about them at the moment.

""hey, where did [names redacted] go? didn't they come back inside after they were done playing with the dog?"" I asked my mother as she was wiping her mouth with a napkin.
""um, no they must still be outside, let 'em play a bit longer"" she said in a joking tone, as if I was their parent. I laughed it off, but inside my anxiety brewed knowing they were still just out there. maybe they'd gone around to the front in the garage to get some sodas, they must have been out there long enough to get tuckered out by now, right? or maybe they were just now making their way back to the door to come inside, only time would tell then.

i stopped myself from looking out the window, and scooted closer to the main coffee table where I could see a game of scrabble was starting. Hopefully I could keep my mind off whatever I was seeing outside. as the game began and I locked myself into playing the game, I successfully kept my anxiety at bay.

at some point maybe about halfway through the game, I excused myself right after one of my turns to go use the potty. I didn't look through the window, but the trip to the restroom would cause me to walk in past the glass door. I was mostly just curious, even if the glass door required me physically walking to the end of a short hallway in order to even be in the mudroom. I did, and as I made my way to see the glass door, I saw it. him. Just standing idly, looking off in the distance with his short hair very visibly being pushed by the wind. but he was there, and he was *big*. he must have been at least 2, 2 and a half feet tall just standing normally. I happened to catch him just before he decided to go for a lie down, curling up behind the glass. as he plopped down, I saw his fur press against the glass. and though it didn't crash through, I did hear a crack. it was as if a horse or a calf laid against it, it wasn't enough to cause any noticeable damage, but I definitely heard it.

this was the last thing I saw before I quickly noped out of the mudroom, scampering down the hallway and into the bathroom. I could feel myself shaking as I peed, almost like I was freezing. the muffled sound of the family having a good time, then a minute later I heard someone exclaim that it was finally my turn again, quickly followed by my mom calling out my name to let me *know* it was my turn to play. I was deep in my own head for a while, what must have been a solid minute or two, before I heard footsteps and a knock on the door.

""d'ya fall in?"" the voice laughed, it was my funny uncle. just as soon as he'd approached the bathroom door, he seemed to leave it to go back to the game. after a few more moments of washing up, I finally opened the door, just as I happened to look out the frosted window over the shower.",3,1742346217.0,CreepCast_Submissions,1,1.0,False

And this time was my turn. I decided to bring one of my favorite deserts, Tiramisu. I made a Lemon tiramisu hoping that everyone would like it and that I could get some feedback because I’d been tinkering with the recipe for a while and needed an outside opinion. My friends loved the desert luckily. But the kicker is that I had soaked the ladyfingers in a mixture of alcohol and mostly water. I was going to make it a point to tell them, but I had other things on my mind and forgot. I was having some more (tiramisu) on the couch after school when I remembered. I figured that I should tell them because I didn‘t want to lie. So I told them in our friend group chat. My friends Breanna and Lauren were fine with it and didn’t have any issues. Chelsea on the other hand was very mad about it. She said that that’s not something to forget abt and that she wouldn’t be eating our snacks again. (I was kind of hurt by this because I am the main person who brings food. Lauren and Breanna don’t bring at all and Chelsea brings every now and again.) I assumed that she (Chelsea) would be ok with it because she was the only one who knew what tiramisu was. So I had also assumed she had had it before. I also assumed that since she had it, she knew that there was coffee and alcohol in the dessert, both of which she doesn’t like. Breanna was telling me that that was something that I should forget about and was defending Chelsea. Lauren on the other hand said that Chelsea needs to calm down because it’s not A big deal because of how much was in it. Idk what to do and Chelsea refuses to speak to me. AITA?

1jel55s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1jel55s/i_played_chess_with_my_partner_today_and_i_swear/,"I played chess with my partner today, and I swear it reignited the spark during a rough patch.","Sorry, I know it's a strange title. But hear me out.

We (me F29, him M30 together 4 years) always offhandedly spoke about playing chess together (he admitted he wanted to learn strategies and actually play as an adult) and I thought ""hey why not?"" But the time never came.

We've been having a rough patch about recent finances (job market for me sucks, can't find a job despite working with an employment agency) and bills are always paid but leaving us mere pennies. I couldn't even afford a chessboard. The arguments began to get nastier, and the spite and resentment was building. While all the costs go up, income is stagnant and we've had to heavily improvise efficiency and utility.

One night, we had a big blow out and I left to hangout with my friend that I confided to about struggles. Obviously best friend loves us both would hate us arguing. But along the lines I brought up how I love playing strategy games like chess. Friend gives me a spare chessboard for free and says ""you guys will work through it, why don't you two play chess together? Kick his ass!""

So after the dust settled we looked at each other and I merely pulled out the chessboard on the coffee table. No words. He smiled and said ""one second! I'll join you!"" And after his usual post-work regime he sat down on the floor with a cushion across from me. 

I'm not sure what has happened, but we ended up playing chess for hours. But it was so much fun? We even forgot about normal dinner time. Between me teaching him strategies and him actually being really good at it and describing tactics I found it hot. Nerd alert. Lol. We unintentionally had such a blast that something sparked in us and we've been flirty and calling each other nerds all night.

Before we knew it we were making dinner together slapping each other's butts and making jokes. And now, he's been saying ""I need my jetpack to sleep!"" (AKA Im the big spoon)

I guess I just wanted to share this, because sometimes I forget how smart my partner is and how funny he can be and I love him. ",2,1742345970.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

I don't drink coffee, so it's not a place I generally frequent, but I thought I would use the card to get myself a sandwich. I'm on the website right now looking at their ""lunch/dinner"" menu and I'm seeing some wraps, bowls, and pizza, but no sandwiches. I just want a BLT. Is this no longer a thing?

She hearts nearly all my text messages, and responds pretty quickly. I often direct and lead the topics of conversation and write thoughtful messages that open the potential for questions but I often receive “nice nice” after I send a long message. I asked her to a coffee date and she said she’d be down. I asked her about her weekend availability and she said she would be busy. She asked to set up a call sometime instead. After saying “sure” to the call, she hearted my message. I’m completely lost and confused on how to approach this. ",1,1742345830.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False
1jel3b4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1jel3b4/my_mother_is_more_annoying_now_that_im_a_mother/,My mother is more annoying now that I'm a mother,"I have been more annoyed with my mom since becoming a mom. I (35F) have a 4 month old baby and a loving husband (34M). She comes to visit us and our baby and will ask for me to make her coffee, get particular about how it's made, request water instead of getting it herself, etc. I make up the guest room for her and she tells me ""I'd rather sleep on the couch"" and proceeds to sleep there without blankets or anything, then complain that she was cold overnight. She does not help with the baby when she visits, not even a diaper change, but will occasionally hold him. On her most recent visit, I had to change my baby so in the process put baby lotion and oil on his skin. When I came back out with him, she said she was having an allergic reaction to whatever I put on him, so she couldn't hold him. She does have lots of food allergies so I know she's sensitive, but baby products are usually benign, so I was confused. She gets mad that I don't video call enough so she can see the baby, but I work full time and have a busy life, so we get 1-2 video calls in per week. 

My biggest annoyance is that recently I sent her a video of my husband blowing raspberries at the baby and baby giggling. Baby was only in a diaper and it was a private moment, but she posted it on Facebook without so much as a warning or consent. She's driving me crazy! ",3,1742345813.0,Vent,1,0.81,False

I prefer to make 1-2 meals and eat them then have peace for 16 h.
Unfortunately I've noticed negative changes in me .
I'm lacking motivation, I'm lethargic, feeling dumb (cant focus ) dizzy and light headed .
I'm getting anxious, I have no ideas about anything. I'm only thinking about time when I can finally eat and trying to waste it till I'll get the food . Because in the mean time I have no energy to do anything. .
And yeah I'm using electrolytes, drinking water, drinking a lot of coffee ☕ etc.
Ive noticed with the time my symptoms became worse ..
Any of you experienced something similar? Also It doesn't really help me with weight loss...",3,1742345784.0,intermittentfasting,2,0.81,False
