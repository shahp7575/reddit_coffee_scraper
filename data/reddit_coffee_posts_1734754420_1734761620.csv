My partner and I haven‚Äôt been in person with each other this whole time and won‚Äôt see each other until after the holidays (we‚Äôre spending them with our separate families). This time apart has been helpful for me to write down my boundaries and requirements for this relationship to continue. 

What do things look like for you when you both live together?

I don‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing a bed with him right now. I know that‚Äôs reasonable. But I‚Äôm wondering about how life stuff is going to work. Like getting groceries, preparing meals, etc. I normally make us coffee and breakfast every morning. I cook for us a lot. I don‚Äôt want to do any of those things while I‚Äôm still working through this very fresh trauma. Logistically though, I just wonder how it‚Äôs going to work. Do I grocery shop just for myself, as if I was living alone? That‚Äôs what I want to do. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just being petty or setting a boundary? 

We don‚Äôt have kids thankfully and it‚Äôs just the two of us in our home. 

I‚Äôd love to hear about some of the more mundane sides of healing and recovery. How do you split up and manage the day to day stuff like groceries, cooking, housework, etc? ",1,1734761366.0,loveafterporn,1,1.0,False

I didn't know that my art teacher was a druggie and was subjecting me to drugs via his breath- he was literally breathing loudly and I thought he just had really bad coffee breath. He said he drank a lot of coffee and needed a lot of coffee to function.

I joined a weekend class that was actually taught by another teacher- I was not made aware of that. I literally thought the teacher was another student who talked more than he painted.

I eventually switched classes for scheduling convenience, and instead, the art teacher claimed that I was 'addicted' to him because of his coffee drug breath. Usually I avoid hanging out or talking to people until I got to know them better, but one time, the art teacher and I ended up walking in the same direction on opposite sides of the road. He wore a black mask, and I was on my way to meet someone, so I just ignored him.

Apparently that became I was following him. Like wtf? First of all, he crossed another road, and I thought he was headed in another direction. I only realised we were walking in the same direction because he kept looking at me from across the road. 

This whole gossip started from a psycho colleague at a previous company I worked for- she claimed that I joined the company because I saw a photo of a male assistant manager and applied to work there to get close to him or whatever- which is all so far from the truth. I joined another sector of the company, and she kept following me around, telling me sob stories about her life, how she's being bullied, she wants me to move to her side for support, etc- all which were lies. She was the one who also wore a mask, precovid, went to work and hugged the male assistant manager in front of his girlfriend. And she argued with the girlfriend over it as well. Like wtf?

Fun fact: the male assistant manager was a druggie and drank nine shots of coffee every morning and his reason was that he couldn't live without it. The coffee represented his girlfriend, who was a barista, and I never found if there was any significance behind the number nine. The female colleague told the male assistant manager that I liked him, and in his mind we were already dating, and his nine shots of coffee became pieces of chewing gum- since I always chewed gum at work. It was really creepy.

The worst part of it was that I was accused for being an addict because I consumed certain foods and drinks that I've been consuming for years, and way before I worked at that company. And it was a psychologist who made it up.

I joined this painting class and I thought I will finally be able to learn how to paint. Instead I was subjected to more bullshit and fucking drugs.",0,1734761059.0,venting,1,0.5,False

Flickering  
again  
like god playing with a light switch  
there, gone, there  
unsure, doubts prevail  
shaking my head  
what did I actually see?  
  
A beautiful face  
a feral wolf  
two images unite  
and I just stare  
into a dare  
from blue/grey eyes  
hearing a snarl in my mind  
  
She writes something  
slips it under my coffee at the counter  
a phone number  
with a missing ¬†digit  
games  
fuck, not going to call  
  
But haunting eyes possess  
three wrong numbers  
on the forth got lucky, or did I?  
  
Without asking if I had plans  
  
*tonight's a full moon, walk with me*  
*pick me up at nine, don't be late*  
  
Borrowed my roommate's best shirt  
leather jacket and boots  
my roommate dresses cool  
  
I'm right on time  
she lets me in  
the chains by the bed throw me  
she's sipping a dark, dark red  
  
*want some?*  
  
‚ÄãSmall talk but not boring  
she has a very intense aura about her  
as if life and ¬†death really matter  
new to the city  
grew up in a small town  
  
*come on, or we'll miss the moon*  
  
*‚Äãbeautiful*... I say to the orb rising from ocean mists  
she looks forlorn  
*hold me*... and cries  
*I'm sorry*... mumbled to my chest  
  
*I want you, do you want me?*  
and bites my neck  
  
*What the fuck lady!*... passing out  
  
Waking up, covered in blood  
my roommate's going to kill me  
her head resting on my shoulder, snoring  
with a cute little purr/growl  
  
*what happened last night?*... panic setting in  
  
*you need to tell me what the fuck is going on*  
  
‚Äã*don't you feel it?*... she asks  
  
A singing deep inside  
and a connection to everything all at once  
fucking dreams aren't real

I worked at the airport for a year and a friend of mine that worked there randomly messaged me asking if we could meet for coffee and talk about tips for solo traveling. 

As a man (specifically a gay one) I felt more obligated to let her know risks as a female that she might encounter that I never did. For example, I told her that Japan or Turkey (both countries I visited) would be safer for her than maybe Brazil or Mexico. Of course, there are safe areas and dangerous areas everywhere. 

Another friend of mine told me that I post a decent amount of my travels on Instagram and I said to him ‚Äúit feels like a counterproductive journal that people see‚Äù. He then added ‚Äúwell you actually inspire some people to travel like you do‚Äù. 

I always thought of my travels as very normal because I‚Äôve been doing it for so long - could be a mild imposter syndrome? But what I‚Äôm noticing is people view me as confident and secure enough with myself to be alone to some extent.

1hj3fre,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTheorists/comments/1hj3fre/fnaf_theory_brain_dump/,Fnaf theory/ brain dump,"sorry I‚Äôm new to sharing my theories/info dump so it may be rough around the edges.  Ive been watching a lot about the new content in help wanted 2 that was dropped a lil bit ago and a lot of things have been driving me crazy like how Bonnie is purple in the stained glass of the mask and gift shop. if this was the very first location I feel like it would‚Äôve been golden if spring bonnie was the main mascot. and with the huge night and day theme with the building having sun‚Äôs and moons a blue bunny would work a ton better then another golden mascot, maybe even back then spring Bonnie maybe was a possible later concept that was specifically to be used to lure kids as kinda like a sun form of Bonnie that comes out for ‚Äúspecial‚Äú events.

Next would be MXES being apparently a huge part, if I remember correctly it was stated MXES was old and being outdated if MXES came from 1979 it almost feels like the mask that‚Äôs in security breach might be a thing back then, which also brings up Shadow Bonnie. Again this character we barely know about shows up for a couple games (fnaf2, fnaf3, fnaf world, fnaf ar, and fnaf ucn) with barely any lore where it‚Äôs first introduce that the animatronics have been given facial scanners and to survive the player must heavily rely on a mask to show your friendly to the robots. Fnaf 3 it‚Äôs given lore through a sprite for how little the minigame is which is to save the children. In utc DeeDee has to summon them, why would the animatronics summon a possible hallucination or ghost to haunt/torture william unless it had some weight and wasn‚Äôt just a random hallucination, and why was shadow Bonnie given such an important job in fnaf AR as to spawn and kill you for collecting too much dark remnant. Fnaf world there‚Äôs not much to go on but I find it interesting is it has the ability gift boxes which only 4 characters use, crying child, Funtime foxy, and coffee, almost as to protect everyone but it‚Äôs not as concrete as the other points.

as for the thing that bugs me out the hardest is the mimic and ennard. Is it just me or does the mimic and ennard seem like mirrors of each other, if there is potentially more then one mimic could it be possible ennard is one, after all they were designed to fit into any suit, they learn everything they see, and mimic voices. Ennard does every one of these things and none other animatronic has had this level of self awareness to do this. If ennard is a mimic program and watched the scooper be used, fix up and modify animatronics, get through to the surface, and watched and understood how people acted it could be completely possible. Not to mention in the 8bit minigame in SL custom night it shows even as ennard has taken over Micheal it still proceeds to keep doing Michael‚Äôs tasks. And even if this wasn‚Äôt the exact case could it be possible for ennard to have been jackie 2.0 or another one in the set.

and finally puppet and jackie. Security puppet looks like it could be paired with Jackie, the hat, the facial expression it just feels like they are a pair, both have boxes, both are clown themed, both have face seams that don‚Äôt do anything it‚Äôs just kinda odd. Security puppet isn‚Äôt a Funtime or really belong with other groups and kinda fit with sun and moon as security puppet is almost like wearing night cap. Also jackie Having nearly The exact same music box sound as puppet is also interesting.

it would be very interesting if the facility is going to be split night and day with day being Jackie, sun, and fredbear with everything being high energy and excitement and night being puppet, moon, and bonnie with a mellow and calm feel but it also seems far fetched of a sort.

anyways thanks for sitting down and listening to my rant of just random interesting stuff I‚Äôve been thinking about. Not sure if it‚Äôs a valid theory due to not explaining with much evidence cuz it‚Äôs extremely late and I just had to get it out before I lose track of thought.

I started therapy at 17, and told my parents I‚Äôd like to quit therapy about a month after I turned 18. After I decided to quit, this therapist called up both of my parents and attempted to convince them to bring me back. 

He told my dad that he thinks I was lying in my last session and told me that I‚Äôd be living at home forever and that I‚Äôll never graduate from college (I‚Äôm a UCLA graduate now). Also a few months after I stopped seeing him, he ran into my dad at a coffee shop that was close to my dad‚Äôs place of work.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Water is essential for life. It plays a crucial role in nearly every function of the human body, from regulating temperature to aiding in digestion. You might wonder, though, how much water should you consume a day? Understanding your hydration needs can help maintain your overall health and wellness.

### The Importance of Hydration

Your body is made up of approximately 60% water. This means that hydration is vital for your physical and mental performance. When you don‚Äôt drink enough water, you can become dehydrated, leading to symptoms like fatigue, headaches, and decreased concentration. Staying well-hydrated is key to keeping your body functioning smoothly.

### Factors That Influence Your Water Needs

There isn't a one-size-fits-all answer to how much water you should drink daily. Several factors can affect your individual hydration needs:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Activity Level:** If you exercise regularly or have a physically demanding job, you‚Äôll need more water to replenish what you lose through sweat.
- **Climate:** Hot and humid weather increases your body's need for hydration. You may sweat more, which means you need to drink more water.
- **Health Status:** Illnesses, fever, or infections can lead to increased fluid loss, meaning you will need to drink more water.
- **Diet:** If you eat a lot of salty or spicy foods, try to drink more water. Additionally, foods like fruits and vegetables contain water and contribute to your daily intake.
- **Age and Gender:** Generally, adult men are recommended to drink about 3.7 liters (or 125 ounces), while adult women should aim for 2.7 liters (or 91 ounces) per day. However, these needs may vary individually.

### Scientific Recommendations for Daily Water Intake

Following scientific recommendations can simplify how to determine your daily water needs. One commonly cited guideline is the ‚Äú8x8‚Äù rule, which encourages drinking eight 8-ounce glasses of water each day‚Äîabout 2 liters or half a gallon. While straightforward, this method is not foolproof for everyone. Some other recommendations include:

- Consider drinking 1 ounce for every 2 pounds you weigh. For instance, if you weigh 150 pounds, aim for 75 ounces a day.
- Monitor your urine color. Light yellow often indicates optimal hydration, while dark yellow may suggest the need for more fluid intake.
- Use hydration apps to track your water intake. These easily remind you to drink water during the day.

### Hydration Beyond Water

While water is vital, it‚Äôs not the only source of hydration. You can boost your fluid intake through:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Other Beverages:** Herbal teas, unsweetened coffee, and other non-caffeinated beverages can count towards your daily intake.
- **Fruits and Vegetables:** Foods such as watermelon, cucumbers, oranges, and strawberries contain high water content that can contribute to hydration.
- **Broths and Soups:** These can also add significant fluid, especially in colder months.

### Listening to Your Body

Ultimately, the best way to ensure you‚Äôre adequately hydrated is to listen to your body. Pay attention to signs of thirst and your energy levels. If you‚Äôre feeling tired or your mouth feels dry, it‚Äôs time to drink. During exercise or hot weather, increase your intake to avoid dehydration.

Understanding how much water you should consume daily is vital for your health. While general guidelines exist, individual factors play significant roles in determining your specific hydration needs. By staying conscious of your body‚Äôs needs and adjusting your fluid intake accordingly, you can maintain optimal hydration and support your overall well-being.

The Benefits of Staying Hydrated: Why Water Matters for Your Health
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Water plays a crucial role in maintaining our overall health and wellness. It makes up around 60% of our body weight and is involved in nearly every bodily function. Staying properly hydrated can lead to a variety of health benefits that can improve your daily life. Understanding why water matters can motivate you to drink enough each day. Here are some of the essential reasons why staying hydrated is vital for your health.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Improves Physical Performance

During physical activities, dehydration can significantly impact your performance. Poor hydration levels can cause fatigue, reduced endurance, and overall decreased athletic ability. Drinking adequate water helps maintain your energy levels and ensures your muscles function optimally during workouts. This means that you can push through those last few reps or run that extra mile with ease.

### Aids Digestion and Nutrient Absorption

Water is essential for effective digestion. It helps break down food so your body can absorb nutrients efficiently. A well-hydrated digestive system reduces the chances of constipation and helps maintain regular bowel movements. Make sure you're drinking enough water to support your digestion and enhance nutrient absorption.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
#### Key Benefits for Digestion:

- Prevents constipation
- Supports healthy stomach acid production
- Helps transport nutrients through the bloodstream

### Regulates Body Temperature

Your body‚Äôs temperature regulation relies heavily on water. When you‚Äôre well-hydrated, your body can sweat effectively, helping to cool you down during hot weather or intense exercise. If you're not drinking enough water, your body may struggle to regulate temperature, leading to heat exhaustion or heatstroke.

### Boosts Cognitive Function

Staying hydrated is also crucial for maintaining cognitive function. Even mild dehydration can affect your mood, concentration, and overall cognitive performance. When you feel tired or foggy, it may simply be a sign that you need more water. Drinking enough fluid can help you stay alert and improve your focus throughout the day.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
#### How Hydration Affects Your Mind:

- Enhances attention span
- Improves memory retention
- Reduces feelings of fatigue

### Promotes Healthy Skin

Your skin is the largest organ in your body, and it is also affected by hydration levels. Proper water intake can help maintain skin elasticity, keeping your skin looking youthful and fresh. When you're dehydrated, your skin can become dry, flaky, and more prone to wrinkles. Drinking enough water helps keep your skin hydrated from the inside out.

### Supports Weight Management

Drinking water can be a powerful ally in weight management. Sometimes, our bodies confuse thirst with hunger, leading us to eat when we are actually just dehydrated. By maintaining proper hydration, you can help curb unnecessary snacking and support your weight loss or maintenance goals. Moreover, consuming water before meals can help you feel fuller, thereby reducing overall calorie intake.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
#### Water and Weight Loss:

- Curbs excessive snacking
- Enhances the feeling of fullness
- May boost metabolism

### Flushes Out Toxins

Another vital role of water is its help in flushing out toxins from your body. Your kidneys rely on adequate hydration to filter waste from the bloodstream and excrete it in the form of urine. Without sufficient water, your kidneys can become strained, leading to health issues. Staying hydrated supports optimal kidney function and overall detoxification of the body.

### Enhances Mood and Energy Levels

Being dehydrated can lead to mood swings, irritability, and decreased energy. Drinking enough water can help improve your mood and boost your energy levels throughout the day. You‚Äôll feel more vibrant and ready to tackle daily tasks simply by ensuring adequate hydration.

Water is a fundamental element of a healthy lifestyle that often gets overlooked. From improving physical performance to supporting cognitive function and maintaining healthy skin, the benefits of staying hydrated are extensive. Make it a goal to drink enough water daily, and enjoy the positive impact it can have on your health and wellbeing.

Myths and Facts About Daily Water Intake: Debunking Common Misconceptions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Water is essential for our survival, yet there are many myths surrounding how much we should drink each day. Understanding the facts can help you stay hydrated and healthy. Let's debunk some of the most common misconceptions about daily water intake.

### Myth 1: You Must Drink Eight Glasses of Water Daily

This popular guideline is a simplistic rule of thumb. The truth is that your water needs can vary significantly based on several factors, including:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Your age
- Your activity level
- The climate you live in
- Your overall health
- Your diet

Many experts recommend that you listen to your body. Thirst is a natural indicator that you need to hydrate. Some people may require more than eight glasses, while others might need less.

### Myth 2: All Fluids Count Toward Your Daily Intake

While it‚Äôs true that beverages contribute to hydration, not all fluids are created equal. Some drinks can actually dehydrate you. Here are a few examples:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Caffeinated drinks:** Coffee and tea have mild diuretic effects, which means they can increase urine production.
- **Alcoholic beverages:** Alcohol can lead to dehydration, especially if consumed in large quantities.
- **Sugary drinks:** Sodas and energy drinks can cause thirst and are not ideal hydrating choices.

While these drinks contribute to fluid intake, plain water is the best option for hydration. It has zero calories and is free from additives.

### Myth 3: You Can‚Äôt Drink Too Much Water

Excessive water intake can lead to a rare condition called water intoxication or hyponatremia. This happens when the balance of electrolytes in your body is disrupted by an extreme intake of water. Symptoms can include:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Nausea
- Headaches
- Confusion
- Severe cases can even lead to swelling in the brain

It's crucial to drink water in moderation and be mindful of how much you're consuming, especially during intense exercise or hot weather.

### Myth 4: You Should Drink Water Even When You're Not Thirsty

Many think that you should drink water regularly, even if you‚Äôre not thirsty. While staying hydrated is important, forcing yourself to drink when you don't feel the need can be counterproductive. Your body has natural indicators to signal when it‚Äôs time to hydrate. Listen to your body instead of following a rigid schedule.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 5: Eating Fruits and Vegetables Doesn‚Äôt Count as Hydration

Many foods have high water content and can contribute to your overall hydration. Fruits like watermelon and oranges, and vegetables like cucumbers and lettuce, contain significant amounts of water. these foods into your diet can help you stay hydrated without drinking excessive amounts of water. Here are a few examples:

- Watermelon - about 92% water
- Cucumbers - around 95% water
- Strawberries - about 91% water

### Myth 6: Thirst Is Not a Reliable Indicator of Hydration

Many believe that thirst is a poor gauge of hydration status, suggesting you must drink water continuously throughout the day. However, your body‚Äôs thirst mechanism is actually quite effective. Thirst signals your body needs water, so feeling thirsty is often a reliable indicator that you should hydrate. If you stay active or are in a hot environment, you may need to drink more regularly, but paying attention to what your body is telling you is always wise.

By discarding these myths and embracing the facts about daily water intake, you can make better hydration choices. Remember, each of us has unique hydration needs, and staying mindful of them is essential for your well-being.

How to Calculate Your Individual Hydration Needs: Factors to Consider
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Staying properly hydrated is vital for your overall health and well-being. But how do you determine your individual hydration needs? The answer lies in various factors that can influence how much water you should drink each day. Knowing these factors can help you make informed decisions about your water intake and ensure you‚Äôre getting the right amount for your lifestyle.

### Body Weight

Your body weight plays a significant role in determining how much water you need. A common guideline is to drink half your body weight in ounces. For example, if you weigh 160 pounds, aim for about 80 ounces of water daily. This basic formula can vary based on other factors, but it offers a starting point to gauge your hydration needs.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Activity Level

How active are you? If you exercise regularly or have a physically demanding job, you‚Äôll need more water to replace lost fluids. During vigorous activities, you can lose a substantial amount of water through sweat. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how to adjust your intake based on activity:

- **Light Exercise:** For low-intensity activities, add an extra 16-24 ounces of water.
- **Moderate Exercise:** For moderate workouts, drink an additional 24-40 ounces.
- **High-Intensity Exercise:** If you engage in intense workouts, you may need 40+ additional ounces of water to stay hydrated.

### Climate and Environment

The climate you live in can greatly affect your hydration needs. Hot and humid weather increases sweating, which requires additional water intake. Similarly, in cold weather, you might not feel as thirsty, but dry air can lead to dehydration. Adjust your intake according to these conditions:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Hot Weather:** Increase your water intake by 16-32 ounces daily.
- **High Altitude:** If you‚Äôre at high altitude, add an extra 16 ounces per day.

### Dietary Factors

Your diet also influences how much water you should consume. Consuming salt, caffeine, and sugar can increase your body's need for hydration. Here‚Äôs how different dietary elements affect your water requirements:

- **Salty Foods:** If your meals are high in sodium, drink more water to help balance your body‚Äôs electrolytes.
- **Caffeinated Beverages:** While coffee and tea do contribute to overall fluid intake, they may also lead to slight dehydration, so compensate by drinking additional water.
- **Water-Rich Foods:** Foods like fruits and vegetables contain water and can contribute to hydration. Be sure to factor this into your daily intake.

### Health Conditions

Certain health conditions can alter your hydration needs. If you have specific concerns, it‚Äôs essential to consult with a healthcare provider. Some conditions that may require adjustments to your water intake include:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Kidney Disorders:** These may affect how you process fluids.
- **Diabetes:** High blood sugar levels can increase urine output, leading to a higher need for water.
- **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Women who are pregnant or nursing should increase their water intake to support both their own needs and those of their baby.

### Personal Comfort and Thirst Signals

Listening to your body is one of the best ways to gauge your hydration needs. Thirst is a natural signal, so don‚Äôt ignore it. Additionally, urine color can be a quick indicator of hydration levels:

- **Light Yellow:** Well-hydrated.
- **Dark Yellow:** Drink more water.
- **Amber or Brown:** Seek medical advice; this could indicate dehydration.

By considering these factors, you can customize your water intake to better suit your personal health and lifestyle. This not only promotes good hydration but also supports your overall well-being. Start by calculating your needs based on these elements, and adjust accordingly to find the right balance for you. Stay mindful, and your body will thank you!

The Impact of Dehydration on Your Body and Overall Wellbeing
------------------------------------------------------------

Dehydration can sneak up on you, often without you even realizing it. It occurs when your body loses more fluids than it takes in, leading to various physical and mental issues. Understanding the impact of dehydration on your body and overall wellbeing is crucial for maintaining optimal health.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Understanding Dehydration

When you think about hydration, you might only consider drinking water. However, hydration includes all fluids you consume, as well as the water your body extracts from food. Dehydration can occur for several reasons, including:

- Inadequate fluid intake
- Excessive sweating
- Diarrhea or vomiting
- Certain medications
- Illness or fever

### Physical Effects of Dehydration

The repercussions of dehydration manifest physically in various ways. Here‚Äôs how it can affect your body:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Fatigue:** You may feel unusually tired, as dehydration can reduce your energy levels and make everyday tasks feel more exhausting.
- **Dry skin:** A lack of water can cause your skin to lose its elasticity, leading to dryness and flakiness.
- **Decreased athletic performance:** If you‚Äôre active, dehydration can affect your stamina and strength. Your muscles need water to function correctly, and dehydration can lead to cramps or strains.
- **Headaches:** Many people experience migraines or tension headaches when dehydrated. Your brain can temporarily shrink from fluid loss, causing pain.
- **Digestive issues:** Water helps in digestion. Inadequate hydration can lead to constipation and other digestive disturbances.

### Mental Effects of Dehydration

Dehydration doesn‚Äôt just impact your body; it can also significantly affect your mind. Here are some cognitive effects:

- **Reduced concentration:** Many people find it harder to focus when they are dehydrated. This can impact work performance or academic results.
- **Increased irritability:** Mood swings and irritability are common in dehydrated individuals. Without sufficient fluids, your brain may not function optimally, leading to frustration and anxiety.
- **Memory issues:** Some studies suggest that dehydration can impair short-term memory and cognitive function, making it harder to retain information.

### Long-Term Consequences

While mild dehydration can cause temporary issues, ongoing dehydration can lead to severe health problems. Chronic dehydration can contribute to:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Kidney stones and urinary tract infections
- Increased risk of heat-related illnesses
- Electrolyte imbalances, which may lead to heart problems
- Increased risk of inflammation
- Potentially contributing to chronic illnesses like diabetes and hypertension

### Staying Hydrated

The key to preventing dehydration is staying on top of your fluid intake. Here are some practical tips:

- **Drink Water Regularly:** Aim for 8-10 glasses of water a day, adjusting based on activity level and climate.
- **Listen to Your Body:** Pay attention to your thirst signals. When you feel thirsty, drink water rather than sugary or caffeinated beverages.
- **Include Hydrating Foods:** Eat fruits and vegetables with high water content, such as cucumbers, watermelon, and oranges.
- **Set Reminders:** Use phone apps or alarms to remind you to drink water throughout the day.

Being mindful of your hydration levels is essential for both physical and mental wellbeing. Recognizing the signs of dehydration and understanding its impacts can help you make better choices. By drinking enough fluids and consuming water-rich foods, you can maintain a healthy balance and support your overall health.

We also tackled prevalent myths about daily water intake, clarifying that while the ""8x8 rule"" is a good starting point, individual needs vary based on numerous factors, including activity level, environment, and overall health. By recognizing these differences, you can better tailor your hydration strategy to suit your lifestyle.

Calculating your exact hydration needs involves considering factors like age, weight, and physical activity. This personalized approach can lead to more effective hydration practices, ensuring you are not just drinking enough but also optimizing your overall health.

Moreover, we highlighted the detrimental effects of dehydration on your body. Even mild dehydration can lead to fatigue, headaches, and decreased cognitive performance. Understanding these impacts underscores the importance of staying hydrated, especially in hot weather or during intense physical activity.

Prioritizing hydration is one of the simplest yet most effective health strategies you can adopt. Make it a habit by keeping a water bottle with you and listening to your body‚Äôs thirst cues. By doing so, you'll set yourself up for a healthier, more vibrant life. Remember, when it comes to hydration, your individual needs matter, so find what works best for you and drink up!

I'm practically a hermit with no life because damn, this is the 10th 9 to 12 hour shift in a row and I worked on a PTO day like an idiot.

I still sit and write about my daily life. What the heck do I even have to write about if I'm a ""hermit""? My day.

I wrote over a page and half about helping my brother return his Amazon package and going to UPS. Wrote another page about the bakery. Just finished a page of ranting about my job. I'm about to write about tonight's tacos.

I somehow managed to stretch 2 stops on my errands run, into over 2 pages. If you want to write, I promise you, there's a story everywhere you look. You just have to ""stop and smell the flowers"". I'll be honest, journaling has made me aware of the tiny things in life often ignored in our rush to and from places.

Describe your day, the smells of the bakery, the things you accidently overhear in line, debating between 2 pieces or 1 piece of bread, the menu board, the coffee you chose, what did it taste like, first snow, chatting with strangers. Describe the barrage of random thoughts you were zoning off about in line or why you're even in the UPS store. 

Don't feel pressured like ""my journal is so boring"". Nobody is looking (unless you want to, tots up to you). Your journal is your pal, probably the ONLY one who is GLAD to hear the most mundane day of your life.

When you're 90, you'll be able to almost visualize that random Friday the 20th odd December, 2024 from the details.

1hj31lp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1hj31lp/what_you_have_to_look_forward_to_two_months_out/,What You Have To Look Forward To - Two Months Out ,"I wanted to share this because I previously posted something like this about a month ago. I want you all to know there is something better on the other side. 

In the beginning, obviously, I was very upset. I was trauma bonded, heavily emotionally abused, and thought everything was my fault. Through therapy, a slight up in my anxiety medication (because I have diagnosed anxiety), and time, truly life has become better. So let me tell you what I have to look forward to after leaving your exBPD. 

One day, you're going to wake up and not be sad anymore. This may sound impossible, stupid, unbearable, but I promise you, once you actually feel peace for the first time, it gets addictive. Not having someone bullying me every single day, telling me how I'm ruining his life, telling me how I need to prove my love to him, hanging an ultimatum over my head, I no longer miss him. 

You rediscover yourself. And I mean that. This is why you can't rush into another relationship quickly. Honestly, I haven't went on a single date yet despite being asked on four. I wasn't a boring, sad person. I picture myself like an abused dog, seriously. I lived life in a cage and I didn't even know it, and I was fine with my cage until I outgrew it. That's why he discarded me. 

You realize just how much your exBPD isolated you. I see my best friend since childhood, who has lived within 30 minutes of me my entire life, about three times a week now. For six years, I saw her maybe once every three weeks. I see all of my friends ‚Äî who he claimed to like, but always never spoke to unless he was in the stage of trying to win them over ‚Äî about once a week at minimum. I'm not lonely, I'm not unlovable, I'm not the worst person to exist.

You do things you like. When I was with my exBPD, his idea of a good time or date night was going to the bar with his friends (read, his family and extended family, since he can't make friends) or going to the bar with me. Despite me drinking a glass of wine once every two weeks, I was expected to go 2-3 times a week to a bar, despite me not wanting to, despite me saying no, despite me saying I'd like to do something else. If I said any of these things, though, he would emotionally punish me. Now, I have rediscovered my favorite things. I go on long walks with my dogs. I jog. I go to cute coffee shops. I thrift. I go to cute little events in my city. I go shopping with my friends. I get boba with my besties. I go to my favorite restaurants and I'm not forced to eat chicken wings every single ""date night"" (his way or the highway, as you know). And I never have to worry about him being there, because I know he's either at one of three bars or his new place. 

You will be shocked by kindness. My best friend has been a great person to relearn affection from. She will grab a coffee for me if she's on her way to my place and getting coffee too. She will clean up after herself. She will be happy to join me on a walk. She will ask me what I want to watch. She will say she likes my music and then she will show me a song she thinks I'll like. She will talk to me, actually, like a human, and laugh with me. The other day I was in the kitchen doing my dishes and she just started a line of me handing her the washed off dishes and putting them in the washer for me. I can tell you, I haven't experienced that in the six years I was with my exBPD. 

You will realize just how one-sided the relationship was. All that love you gave your ex? All that gratitude, fulfillment, the good times? That was you. And if it was you being truly happy, good. But be honest, how much of it was you compromising so they could have a good time? How much of it was their way or their highway? How much did you have to beg for them to spend time doing things you wanted? How much did you compromise for them, and they offered nothing in return? 

You will realize how they NEVER compromised. My therapist asked me when he compromised on something. This was four weeks ago. I still don't have a single thing. And when I do, I think, ""Well, he got mad at me or blamed me or told me I was selfish for asking or shamed me."" Whenever we reached a compromise on my behalf. 

You can do everything yourself because you already were. I mean that. And those things that might feel heavy ‚Äî extra work for kids, pets, cleaning, etc. Girlie. You were doing it the whole time on your own. Now you don't have a BPD partner you also have suckling on your teet. 

Your energy will be through the roof. I mean that. Now that I don't take care of him and his temper tantrums, now that I don't spend my time trying to prove myself to him, I have enough energy. It's comparable to my college years. I can clean my house. Go on a jog. Walk my dogs. Get ready in the morning. Read. Write. Draw. And still have time for my friends and family and not feel exhausted. I used to think I just needed time to recharge. Little did I know, I was just constantly running on E because he kept me that way. 

You're going to find love again. Just be patient. Discover what you like. This is important. I've been on the dating apps and talking to men, and my rule is that the moment some guy tells me how he feels guilt or is sad about some incredibly personal stuff, I don't let my empathy take over. I unmatch. It's not my job to caretake someone. I'm not that one. I won't ever do that again. Dating apps allow you to put a safe fence between you and a potential BPD or Narcissist. If you get the ick from someone, unmatch and move on. In the beginning, I started with dating apps and I almost met a man who, looking back, he was 100% a narcissist or similar. He told me all about his mental illnesses, all about his struggles, complained about everything, and started ""future faking"" with a woman he hadn't even met before. For a few days, I was like ""Oh yeah, this guy is perfect."" I look back now and I'm horrified I ever let myself talk to him so long. I just wanted to take care of someone, I wanted to be useful, I wanted to be validated. The man wanted a maid and therapist, just like my ex. When you give yourself time to simmer down and really relax, you'll realize just how tired that makes you. (Clarification, I have not found love and am not actively looking for it. I want to be me again. Boyfriends are like biscuits and gravy. Biscuits taste great on their own. Gravy can make it even better.)

They're going to date someone else. They're going to announce their love on social media. And you know what I did. I deleted my social media. I blocked him. I went absolutely no contact. And still, I get emails from him, hoovering. I read them, laugh, and then delete. And if you don't think you'll get hoovered, you will. Christmas and New Years is coming after all, expect a holiday message. I already got mine. Instead of seeing these as branches of getting back together, know what they are. They want to see if they control you still. 

You're going to be just fine. It just takes time. It just takes patience. What helped me is accepting the absolute worst possibilities, which at the time, was: He's truly happy and I did this. I cried for two days straight. Then I thought, wow, if that's the worst thing, that means he's happy and I made a mistake like all humans do. Be kind to yourself. Laugh more. Drink plenty of water. Show love to people in your life, because you have people who love you. Bake them a cake. Take them to that museum your ex said was dumb. Compliment a stranger. Hold onto hope. It's coming.

Misunderstanding about gifts with neurotypical partner","Hi all! Any fellow ADHDer advice is helpful here - I was just kindly informed by my friends that I ""need"" to get my partner a gift for Christmas (the words ""this is an intervention"" were jokingly used). Thing is, my partner specifically proposed the idea of and then bought an expensive coffee maker as a gift to both of us back in November??? I feel totally confused and blindsided. The way my friends were joking, I think they were being kind and trying to gently hint that my partner let them know that he got me something big or meaningful, and either he or my friends heard me mention the coffee maker as our gift recently and realized that I had no idea and was completely misunderstanding the situation. I am genuinely grateful to my friends, but also very, very confused.

* Should I ask my partner straight-up what the deal is with gifts this year?  
* Or should I go out and try to find something for him, taking the lifeline offered by my friends, and just pretend everything is normal?

To be honest, the idea of my friends and my partner talking about stuff like this and coming to a consensus about me behind my back is kind of a huge nightmare and trigger for me. I suppressed my initial emotional reaction (to be defensive and mad at my partner for demanding gifts???) and thanked my friends sincerely in the moment, but it still has me feeling just kind of...weird?

In my 20‚Äôs everyone was figuring themselves out, learning through mistakes, and partying. I didn‚Äôt feel any pressure to give the kids thing much thought.

In my early 30‚Äôs the party started dying down. People were getting married in droves but there was still quite a few of us ‚Äòlate bloomers‚Äô still living  pretty carefree and enjoying the financial stability your 30‚Äôs tends to bring. I still felt like ‚ÄòI had time‚Äô whatever that means.

Now I‚Äôm 38. My younger sibling just had her first child. Suddenly the pressure. is. ON. If I don‚Äôt make a decision, biology will make it for me.

I‚Äôm in the healthiest relationship I‚Äôve ever been, with the most kind loving patient man. And out of nowhere when it‚Äôs the most logical next step *I don‚Äôt know if I want a child*.

I‚Äôm not afraid. I KNOW I can handle the feedings, sleeping, burping, crying.

I started watching my niece alone when she was 3 months old. I find the early months to be a breeze. 

But just this past weekend I baby sat her now at 11 months and JFC IT IS SO MUCH WORK.

She doesn‚Äôt want to nap much. She wants to CRAWL. She wants to EXPLORE. She wants you to support her by the hands and ‚Äòwalk‚Äô her around. 

Trying to scroll social media and enjoy a cup of coffee? NOPE. Within 15 seconds she‚Äôs heading full speed ahead towards whatever it is that‚Äôs dangerous and not appropriate to play with. 

She won‚Äôt self entertain, she cries bloody murder if you put her in the playpen so she‚Äôs ‚Äòcontained‚Äô.

She gets bored after 10 minutes of playing with whatever baby toy is appropriate for her. Doesn‚Äôt this child realize there are HOURS in a day? Make it last kid, make it last. I was counting down the minutes until it was nap time so I could get some ME time. 

‚ÄúOh this stage goes so fast, it doesn‚Äôt last long‚Äù my mother tried to reassure me when I told her idk how my sister does this day in and day out. Sure, someone can watch your kid for a couple hours but *responsibility* is right back waiting for you the next day. 

And suddenly I realized it. It would be YEARS of this in different dressings. Battles over wearing what they want, getting up for school, homework, putting on hold whatever I‚Äôm in the mood to do for kiddie time. Educating them enough on the dangers of drugs and making good life choices. Hoping the world isn‚Äôt going to continually get more difficult financially bc the powers that be don‚Äôt care about your mental health if you can‚Äôt continue to pull your own weight economically.

And I just was immediately exhausted at the thought of all of it. I‚Äôm embarrassed to say that all I could feel at the thought‚Ä¶.is a lifetime of burden. The burden being needing to prioritize baby/child over what I might need whether it‚Äôs sleep or alone time or rest. 

Someone else being my responsibility for the rest of my life. Someone else affecting my mood and feeling‚Ä¶proud when good, disappointment and shame when bad. I truly think I would resent an innocent child merely for the things (attention) they need as a result of existing. 

I‚Äôve long suspected I‚Äôm neurodivergent. I have a very low tolerance for noise. I need to leave public place immediately once I start to feel overwhelmed. I require lots of alone and quiet time to recharge or I become a mess emotionally.

Or maybe I‚Äôm just selfish. I feel selfish. I can‚Äôt stop thinking ‚Äòwhat about ME and my wants?‚Äô when posed with the thought of being a mother. It‚Äôs truly a selfless thankless job. 

But to risk it all for the ‚Äòexperience‚Äô‚Ä¶.i feel would be grossly irresponsible for me and unfair to a child.

Basically it started with some pain and one day after sex I started bleeding out, a lot. Like a lot, enough for a few minutes and went into the shower and was crying. I took a pregnancy stick and was fine. 

6 months later I wake up, didn‚Äôt have sex and bled for 34 minutes which led me to the ER. Which took them 8 and a half hours to give me electrolytes and tell me I have endo. 

Now I have had testing done by the hospital/clinic and have had a large cyst that is now going down in size because they suggested nexploton. I‚Äôve been on it before but now I‚Äôm back on birth control for 7 months. The cyst is down in size but I‚Äôm having SOO many problems. 

I have gained 30lbs in months. I hardly eat, don‚Äôt snack, and can‚Äôt lose it. I know it‚Äôs weight gain from it but this is extreme. With that and the bloating I get, I can‚Äôt wear anything. Also when I go to the gym and start to work out I always end up in so much pain. Even the other day I walked 1.2 miles and had horrible cramps where I had to go home and go under my heating pad. It‚Äôs like working out isn‚Äôt really an option with endo because of the pain. How do you resolve this?

I have health insurance now and it‚Äôs taken 4 months to get a gyno appointment. I did manage to get a doctors appointment a few days ago and he blew off all my symptoms I have to endo. 

Basically everything I told him was blamed on my endo and I can‚Äôt do anything until I see the gyno. 


Here are the symptoms from my notes:

I have always drank 1-2 cups of coffee a day, some times with butter. I have been a nicotine user for most of my life, (chewing tobacco, nicotine pouches, and the occasional vape). I have been taking the same electrolyte drink for weeks, but added boron pills (1mg a day) and that seems to help with the cramps (been taking the boron pills for a couple weeks now). 

Not sure what's going on, can anyone give some guidance?

I (20F) live with my roommate, Emily (21F), and we've been sharing a pretty small apartment since the beginning of August. Everything‚Äôs been good between us, except for the fact that recently she keeps using my favorite mug. It‚Äôs this cute, hand made mug I got from an artist at a farmer's market in my home town, so it's not like I could easily get a second one. It‚Äôs one of the few things I‚Äôve brought to this apartment from my home, and it‚Äôs super sentimental to me.

For the past couple of weeks, I‚Äôve noticed that every time I go to make coffee, my mug is missing. I‚Äôve found it in the kitchen after Emily‚Äôs used it, and I‚Äôve politely told her a few times that I don‚Äôt want her using it. She always says she ‚Äúforgot‚Äù and that she‚Äôll wash it right after, but almost every morning by the time I get to the kitchen the mug is used and on the counter, and she is gone to class. For reference, she has morning classes most days, whereas I work at noon and go to class in the evening, so most of the time she is up before me.

I feel like a crazy person now, but this morning I set my alarm an hour earlier than usual and I caught her in the kitchen using it again. I confronted her again and told her to stop using it, and she said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being really dramatic about a mug.‚Äù I got fed up and snapped, telling her that she‚Äôs disrespecting my things and that I‚Äôm tired of her ignoring my requests. I told her if she ever uses it again, I‚Äôll lock it in my room. I'm really bad with confrontation and I teared up a bit, but I asked her nicely so many times!

She got really upset, saying I was overreacting and that I should just let it go. Then she splashed water in the mug, put it on the counter, said ""happy?"", and left. I guess she texted some of our other friends because a few hours later I got a bunch of texts from a couple of them saying I was too harsh. I haven't spoken to anyone else about this yet, and it's really getting to me. I wish I kept my composure, but I honestly feel like she‚Äôs been crossing a boundary.

1hj2joz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1hj2joz/the_only_person_hes_discarded_avoidant_insight/,"""The Only Person He's Discarded"": Avoidant Insight Appreciated","**I finally broke and texted my ex a long message explaining that he hurt me in dire need of some clarity, but knowing I'm probably not even going to receive a response. I would love insight from an Avoidant- I just want to get over  my DA(?) ex but also just miss him so badly. My ex told me I was the only person he's discarded and I'm so confused.**

I've decided not to date for a long time after this but I'm genuinely confused and want to fix whatever is broken within me that's causing this to happen. Because Ive dated 2 DAs prior to this and I just want to attract secure partners.

I met my ex in March at the coffee shop I work at when he ran in, saw me, stopped and told me how beautiful my eyes were. He was so forward and seemingly written out of a book. He had charm, charisma, and made me feel like I was floating. We didnt see each other again or date until July but during that gap, he was asking our mutual friends about me and began pursuing me pretty heavily. I should've listened to my body because I felt anxiety about how fast he was trying to move and how immediately I was showered with compliments and affection. I had some friends who were concerned but others who really thought it was genuine.

We connected when I got out of an abusive relationship and ended up talking for hours on end, multiple nights in a row. We quickly got hooked onto each other and moved at an unhealthy pace. He told me he had a good family history and had previously been in a 4 year relationship - he seemed secure to me. He took me on a date the next week and we stayed up until 8am just talking. He ended up staying the night and we got intimate the next morning.

I told him i wanted to start slow bc i was alarmed at the speed he was going and I had just gotten out of a relationship. After we got intimate on our first date, he said something like ""I dont even know what we're doing"" and laughed and kept offering a ""go with the flow"" ""i do you, you do me"" but we remain committed to each other and head towards a relationship. I told him I wanted to date with intention and that he didnt want a situationship and he completely agreed but was still pretty vague with actual intentions. He was pretty busy with running and work, but saw me whenever he could. He would come into my work and kiss me very publicly, kiss me in the middle of my sentences, interrupt me to tell me how lovely and beautiful I was, and tell me how safe he felt with me. The ""safe"" thing always worried me because my previous DA ex would say that too. But our chemistry was unlike anything I had experienced and he truly seemed like a hopeless romantic, written out of a book. He would play me soul music in the morning, cook for me always, and was simply just so sweet on me.

I started to notice in the beginning that he would shut down when anything emotional came up. Or if I told him how i felt about him and gave him compliments, he would change the subject or make it lighthearted somehow. He asked me about my abusive mom in the beginning and once he noticed I was tearing up, he went to go shower mid-sentence and came back without saying a word. A couple of weeks later, I fell down the stairs and he didnt ask if i was okay and refused to talk about it.. He didnt even come down, he just stood at the top until I got up (i was pretty bruised. it was a hard fall). He never said a word about it after that, even if i brought up my bruise or how silly that was. 

After a month, he had some big life changes. He quit his job (he has quit a lot of jobs.. this time to pursue modeling which has not panned out.) and he moved into a new house. During this time, he stopped calling me beautiful, stopped showering me with affection, and started to be pretty distant but would be great in person. He didnt initiate hangouts as much or visit me at work as often, but said he was busy. I noticed that anytime I would bring up a need, he would shut down or avoid what i said altogether and just change the subject into something really lighthearted.

When it came to his past relationships , he always mentioned that they never talked about things. That me having basic conversations about dating expectations were as far as he had gotten in communication with other ex's. He had gotten out of a 4 year relationship less than a year before. They started off long distance, then both moved to our state together and he has described their relationship as very toxic.. She was avoidant and their relationship had a rocky start bc he had sex with his ex while they were casually dating, wanting to keep her side of the relationship polyamorous but always accused him of cheating, though he's very monogamous. They went to couples therapy and tried what they could. He said they both just randomly lost feelings. He would post the SWEETEST things about her and seemed so emotionally available with her, but he told me he was just trying to fix things.. But the way he treated her online was how he treated me in the beginning. He was the sweetest boy I had ever met before things suddenly changed.His other ex relationships he said lasted 6 months and they both broke up with him out of the blue. (one was his roommate that overlapped with his last ex. They continued to live together even while he and his recent ex dated) He also described them as push pull but said he would still always go visit them at work, went official with them, and was upset because they didnt want to remain friends. though i get confused because he told me they told him he was very robotic and cold towards them in the end. 

One day out of nowhere, about 2 months in he told me he didnt have time for a relationship and that maybe i wanted too much from him that he couldnt give based on his running schedule (he started to become ""too busy"" and didnt want to lose himself to a relationship). But once he offered friendship and I said no, his heart seemed broken and he told me he had no intention on breaking up with me but wanted to see how our lives fit together with his schedule. We agreed on only seeing each other 1x a week so that he could focus on running and prioritize his life, although this felt really shitty on my end. I tried my best to be supportive, even though i was feeling really anxious and heartbroken.

When i would try to bring things up or ask for reassurance (before you come at me, i did my best to be very ""chill cool girl"" about it), he would shut down and not respond and then later come back with a response that was SO reassuring that even my therapist and friends were fooled. It made me think i was overthinking it all and he really was just an overly laid back guy with ADHD. He'd apologize and say hed work on being better at communicating. Communication was AWFUL at this point. (very inconsistent, all about his schedule, mostly about him, mostly about trail running..) No matter how anxious he'd make me,  he always reassured me, was still VERY physically affectionate (though not in public anymore. again, when i started to show it back he stepped back), and mainly just limited physical sweet connection to sex. But he would say things that made me think i was still just overthinking it all.

**T**hen finally, we had the best weekend and then he went on a 10 day running trip. He was so distant while he was gone, but this wasnt anything i wasnt used to at this point, and he would post on Instagram without checking in (which is fine but he was very blatantly ignoring me lol). He'd respond to me in the morning and then send a message right before bed, but was online all throughout the day and said he didnt do much throughout the days. I sent a text asking if he could just sends a heads up if he didnt want to talk that day (i tried to make it v sweet and not accusatory) and he ignored me all night. I sent another text apologizing and blaming myself for asking too much -- this was the biggest spiral i had gone into lol i really try not to show it to him. and then he responded in the morning with a text kind of brushing it over, apologizing, saying it wasnt a big expectation and he understood, and then a million other texts about running.

He always would say he'd do better, but would end up being more distant than before. But then when we were together, hed get really sweet and have moments where he acted in love like he did in the beginning.. But the amount of distance starting to overshadow the good. But the good would be SO GOOD and he'd be so sweet again.

We went a few weeks seeing each other in between his trip and mine, taking each other to and from the airport and when we finally were done with our trips he was being so sweet again and I was so excited that things were seeming normal once again. He picked me up from the airport and the next morning, he took me out to a diner and again, something seemed so off. I asked him what was going on and he said ""I just want to be friends"" (he had no intentions of telling me that day and i had just stayed the night at his house)

He told me that he didnt see me romantically and there was no possibility of him seeing me romantically. He was INSISTENT on being friends and having me in his life, doing all of the same things that we had before like talking about life, going to concerts, etc, but not as frequently. He told me he just didnt desire me and that he no longer wanted to make me a priority in his life.. he also kept going back and forth between saying that i was the ""only person he's lost interest in like this"" and ""this is a pattern and he doesn't know why he does it"". ?????? He told me about his other relationships and how they left him out of nowhere (he has this belief that people always leave, which we talked about in the beginning), and how he wanted to try with them but they just left and  
didnt want to be friends.. Though he said he was told he was robotic with them.. How his other relationships were very push pull and with me, he just didnt have a desire to ""come back"" like he did in his other relationships. He said he used to be able to see a future with me and now he cant. That we're a ""mismatch"" and ""incompatible"" but he cant give me any answers as to why.

he told me i had done nothing wrong and had only been supportive and loving from the start. he said he didnt lost any attraction for me and there was no one else, that he couldn't even date right now if he tried. but he simply didnt see me romantically and still wanted friendship with me. he said he had been contemplating this before his trip and was wondering why he didnt desire me, but didnt have any answers.. he really said i was the only person hes done this to. He seemed like he didnt care other than just feeling guilt and he wanted to meet the following week to talk about being friends.

Then he went on a trip and was stone cold towards me (I hardly texted him, just to figure out the logistics of when we'd meet up. I dated a DA before and was trying to be respectful of the assumed space he'd need.) He was cold towards me until we eventually made it work for him to come to my house two weeks later.

When he finally came to my house, i told him i couldnt have him in my life. But then it was the first time i hadnt seen him as his usual positive and sweet self. He looked horrible and started talking for an hour about how he cant get a job, cant keep anyone close in his life (literally said his two closest people live with him and its out of convenience. he hasnt even known them a year and neither of them tell him really anything in their lives.) He was telling me about how horrible his life was and how he made it this way and this was all his fault.. I had never heard him talk like this before and honestly was shocked. Again, he comes off as very charming and secure. I also confronted that I saw him on Hinge and he said his friend made him make one, but ive still seen him on it despite ""not having time for a relationship""

He told me he did care and we kind of started talking about nonsense for an hour (literally the most random light things).. then suddenly he started holding me, crying. Then told me I was so perfect in our relationship and didnt do anything wrong and that hed be waiting for me whenever i was ready for friendship. That hed have his schedule ready and hed always be there.

He left and I reached out a few weeks later on Thanksgiving. I reached out because my friend said he started coming around the bar that my friends work at (he lives outside of our city) and was going there during the day, seeming really lonely and trying to get back into our friend's lives. I missed him so much and just sent him a text that I hoped he was doing well, was surrounded by love, and sent him some film photos I had just received of him from the month prior.

No response.

And then tonight, I crashed out and sent him a long text about what he did to me and how his actions have affected me. I know I probably shouldn‚Äôt have but I think I just spent so much of our relationship and breakup trying to help him and taking the blame, that my heartache turned to one last desperate attempt in poorly getting his attention.

Despite all of this, im sad and i miss who i had in the beginning. I miss who I thought was my person. I want him back so badly but know thats never going to happen. I guess I'm here because I know he's not going to respond and I'm never going to get the closure I need from him, but I want to hear from an avoidants perspective.

\- Why did he give his other ex's years of his time and he couldnt handle 4 months with me?  
\- Why did he discard, hold me crying, beg for friendship, then not respond when I reached out?

\- Is this truly avoidant or something else? He seems anxious in other relationships and tried couples therapy with his ""abusive' ex until he lost feelings.

\- How do I cope with being the ""only one"" he has discarded like this?

\- Honestly any insight you can give is helpful. I feel insane and have tried to rationalize this, but it feels like nothing helps me understand what went wrong when he said multiple times that i was only supportive and loving, never asking for too much and being ""perfect"". He has told me its him and not me, but my heart cant cope with the thought that I'm the ""one off"" to him.

I've tried everything from EMDR, weekly therapy, and even talking with a relationship coach that specializes in avoidant attachment... Everyone says I'm not the problem, but I cant help feel blame and confused that I'm the ""one off"" of discards in his life.. How do I truly move on?",1,1734756699.0,AvoidantBreakUps,6,1.0,False

 I am hooked by the prospect of what I want me espresso by Sabrina Carpenter to smell like. I've heard mixed reviews, so I'm looking for something more reliable. Does that make sense?

 Looking for something with coffee/latte/cappuccino scents. I'm not a coffee drinker so I'm not super familiar with the nuances but something that smells like walking into a coffee shop. Baked goods going like vanilla or chocolate or biscotti.

Hours of brainstorming had reached a screeching halt, the flow of ideas stop like a river blocked by a dam.  Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Dan was the first to speak up.

‚ÄúGot it,‚Äù Dan said with a snap.  ‚ÄúReceptionist.‚Äù

‚ÄúNeeds to use a phone,‚Äù I glumly replied.

‚ÄúShit,‚Äù Dan muttered.

‚ÄúMaybe sales at a clothing store?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù Dan said.  ‚ÄúBut she‚Äôll probably end up insulting the inventory for not meeting her impossible standards.  Plus, cash register.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúUgh!‚Äù Dan leaned back into the couch.  ‚ÄúI know the influencer thing failed but why not just make her a regular model?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo dice.  Emma‚Äôs gonna think the camera is trying to steal her soul.‚Äù

Dan sighed, picked up the notepad, and scribbled off another job idea.  He kept scribbling, faster and faster, until the lead in the pencil snapped.  He tossed the pencil and pad angrily on to the coffee table and silently fumed.

I rubbed my temples.  ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúThere are practically zero jobs that don‚Äôt require any form of technology.  So, maybe we need to focus on getting her used to technology before we can get her employed.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike, exposure therapy?‚Äù Dan asked.

‚ÄúKinda,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúWe just need to make her understand that technology isn‚Äôt magic and to start feeling comfortable around it.  Then she‚Äôll finally be able to hold down a job.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcept for her lack of any practical skills.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúBut one problem at a time.‚Äù

Dan leaned his face on one of his hands.  ‚ÄúThis sounds like it‚Äôll take forever.‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably,‚Äù I conceded.  ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs probably our best plan for now.  Once we can get her a job, then we can begin the process of moving her out.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis plan better work, Peterson,‚Äù Dan said.  ‚ÄúBecause if she‚Äôs not at least making some progress by the end of the month, then I‚Äôm kicking both of you out.‚Äù

I reeled back in shock.  ‚ÄúSeriously?  What the hell, Dan?!?‚Äù

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù said Dan with an emphatic finger point.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one who brought her here!‚Äù

‚ÄúShe followed me through the portal!‚Äù

‚ÄúRight!  She followed *you*!  Not *me*!‚Äù

I groaned.  He wasn‚Äôt wrong for feeling this way but it still hurt.  ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, man‚Ä¶‚Äù

Dan rolled his eyes.  ‚ÄúFine.  I‚Äôll give you more time.  But I swear, if she destroys my computer because she hates magic, you‚Äôre both on the street.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù  

‚ÄúI mean it,‚Äù Dan said with the upmost seriousness.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve put two grand into that thing.  That‚Äôs my baby.‚Äù  Dan grabbed me by the collar and pulled me in close until our noses were barely touching.  ‚ÄúIf she destroys my PC I swear to God *I will go scorched earth.*‚Äù

I pushed Dan back.  ‚ÄúAlright, I get it!‚Äù  I leaned back in my chair.  This whole thing had become a nightmare so quickly.  Dan and I somehow managed to get Emma three more interviews since the grocery store and every single one of them had rejected her.  If it wasn‚Äôt her fear of technology making her unhirable, it was her spoiled and sheltered upbringing.  If I didn‚Äôt figure a plan out soon, Dan was gonna dump her at an Amish village and be done with it.  Which admittedly was sounding more and more tempting‚Ä¶

‚ÄúI mean,‚Äù I started to say, hoping to push away that uncomfortable line of thinking.  ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt mean to be so‚Ä¶you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù said Dan.  ‚ÄúBut she‚Äôs also the reason we have to start budgeting for fire extinguishers.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrue‚Ä¶‚Äù

Emma stepped into the living room‚Äîor rather, danced.  She always seemed to walk around the apartment with little twirls and shimmies, humming songs of her own creation to herself.  It would almost be cute if she didn‚Äôt also do it while trying to bash our blender with a golf club the other day.  Emma had finished her long bath and gotten dolled up.  ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúNothing!‚Äù Dan and I said simultaneously.  Dan took the writing pad and tossed it away from us. 

If Emma noticed our strange behavior, she didn‚Äôt show it.  ‚ÄúWell, no matter.  Go freshen up, dear.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked.  

Emma scoffed.  ‚ÄúBecause I wish to have a romantic dinner with my husband-to-be, of course!‚Äù

‚ÄúDinner?  It‚Äôs only‚Äî‚Äù I checked my phone and saw the time.  ‚ÄúSix?  Shit, guess I lost track of the time.‚Äù

‚ÄúPrecisely,‚Äù Emma said.  ‚ÄúYou must be simply famished.  Go on, wash up.  I have prepared us a scrumptious picnic to enjoy.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I said with a fake smile.  ‚ÄúGoodie.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, yes, you can praise me when we are at the picnic.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen we reach it?‚Äù I asked.  ‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù

***

I closed the access door to our apartment complex‚Äôs roof and made my way to the picnic blanket Emma had set up.  She sat down with her picnic basket and set out some wine glasses filled with some of Dan‚Äôs energy drinks.  Emma had found she didn‚Äôt really like wine but loved Gamerade, particularly the ‚ÄúLag-Free Lime‚Äù flavor.  She‚Äôd been drinking a lot of them, which was another reason Dan wanted her out of the apartment.  

I sat down on the blanket.  ‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs for dinner?‚Äù I asked with dread and trepidation.  

Emma sat up proudly.  ‚ÄúWell, Dan recommended a meal so easy that even a child could do it‚Äîegg sandwiches!‚Äù  She reached into the basket and took out two ‚Äúsandwiches‚Äù‚Äîby which I meant blackened pieces of toast with a raw egg smashed between them.  ‚ÄúWhat do you think?  Did I do well?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶‚Äù I desperately tried to think of an answer that wouldn‚Äôt hurt her feelings but failed.  ‚ÄúNo.  That‚Äôs‚Ä¶that‚Äôs not how you make those.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Emma sighed.  ‚ÄúDrat.  I thought I did so well.  I only started two fires this time!‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said, putting on a reassuring smile.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs progress.‚Äù

‚ÄúQuite.‚Äù  Emma took another dignified sip of her energy drink.  ‚ÄúAt least the refreshments are nice.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know those aren‚Äôt super healthy for you, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù Emma asked.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so.  I‚Äôve already had four glasses today and I feel fine.  Although my head has been buzzing for some reason.‚Äù  She took another drink, draining her glass.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, pushing my glass away from me.  ‚ÄúYou should definitely stop drinking those.‚Äù

Emma let out a defeated sigh.  ‚ÄúCurses.  It seems my picnic idea wasn‚Äôt as successful as I hope.  I am terribly sorry, my love.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúI can order us takeout.‚Äù  

‚ÄúTake us where?‚Äù Emma asked.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù  I texted Dan ‚ÄúPicnic was a bust.  Chinese?‚Äù  He responded with a laughing reaction and a thumbs up emoji.  ‚ÄúSo, what made you pick the roof for our picnic?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt seemed a natural spot,‚Äù Emma said.  ‚ÄúAfter all, it‚Äôs difficult to go anywhere without one of those awful horseless carriages yelling at me.  And besides‚Ä¶‚Äù  She drifted off as she stared at the evening sky, the sun beginning to dip under the horizon.  ‚ÄúThe sunset is beautiful, is it not?‚Äù

I stared at the sky with her.  It was hardly perfect view.  Buildings blocked a lot of the sky and the ambience was dampened by car horns and a couple arguing a few apartments down.  But Emma was completely enraptured by the sky, oblivious to everything else.  ‚ÄúYeah, it is.‚Äù

The two of us just watched the sky in silence for a few minutes.  Emma sighed.  ‚ÄúI never tire of this sight.  It is my favorite thing about this place.‚Äù  She turned to me a gently pat my hand.  ‚ÄúOther than you, of course.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou not get sunsets in your world or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe do.  But‚Ä¶‚Äù  Emma brought her knees to her chest and her expression soured.  ‚ÄúI spent the majority of my life inside the palace.  I rarely got to peer out a window.  I never saw the sun rise or set until‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶until what?‚Äù I asked.

Emma turned to me.  ‚ÄúUntil Count Osvald first kidnapped me.‚Äù

I cringed.  ‚ÄúYikes.  Sorry such a beautiful thing was tainted.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite all right,‚Äù Emma said.  ‚ÄúThe memory isn‚Äôt actually tainted, all things considered.‚Äù  Emma stared wistfully into the orange sky.  ‚ÄúI had been a prisoner on his ship for a few days at the time.  I had been locked in a cell without any windows.  Osvald came down and asked if I was enjoying my stay.  He asked it to mock me, I‚Äôm sure, but I told him that I was used to not seeing the sky.  He left after that, struck silent by my retort, but he came back a few hours later.  He opened my cell and forced me to go to the deck with him.  I thought he was planning to throw me overboard but instead he told me he wanted to show me something.  And‚Ä¶I saw it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe sunset?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Emma replied.  ‚ÄúBut more than just that.  A saw a field of these beautiful flowers.  Osvald said they were lilies.  Under the golden light of sun, they looked like a sea of stars.  It was the most beautiful sight I had ever witnessed.  After that, he allowed me the freedom to roam the ship.  I made attempts to escape, of course, but I found myself unequipped to survive in the harsh wilderness beyond the capital.  So, I wandered the ship as I pleased and Osvald only interfered to send me back to my cell for the night.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúGuess your time with that Osvald guy wasn‚Äôt all bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said.  ‚ÄúOsvald was always a gentleman with me, all things considered.  Yes, he ripped me from my home in a bid to seize power but he and his undead abominations never laid a finger on me.‚Äù

‚ÄúMakes sense,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúYou said he was trying to ransom you back to your dad, right?  Hurting you would probably make that harder to do.‚Äù

‚ÄúI suppose you‚Äôre right,‚Äù Emma said.  For some reason she sounded so glum when she said that.  Guess being talked about like a bargaining chip bummed her out.  Whoops.

‚ÄúAnyways,‚Äù I said, moving on as quickly as I could.  ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Osvald‚Äôs deal?  You said he was a count, right?  How did he become a captain of a flying pirate ship manned by skeletons?‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, right,‚Äù said Emma, her frown fading.  ‚ÄúOsvald is the scion of House Rosenveld, a formerly prominent noble house.  When I was young, his parents were convicted of conspiracy against the crown.  They had planned to have my father and I assassinated so they could maneuver to seize emergency power.  The count was going to use black magic to raise an undead army to enforce his rule.  They were found out, however, and my father had them executed.  Osvald inherited the estate while he was still a child and spent years tricking everyone into believing he was nothing like his parents.  Then, a few years ago, he snuck into the palace and kidnapped me.  He tried to spin a web that this was all for my own good but I knew he only wanted me as a tool to finish his parents‚Äô work.  My father sent heroes like yourself to rescue me and bring Osvald to justice.  But the count would always elude them and return to snatch me away once more.  I‚Äôve honestly lost count of how many times he‚Äôs held me prisoner.‚Äù

I put a hand on her shoulder.  ‚ÄúWell, don‚Äôt worry.  Dan and I won‚Äôt let him take you again, Emma.‚Äù  Emma smiled sadly but turned away from me.  ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù she said.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶that name.  ‚ÄòEmma.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about it?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶no one had ever called me that before.‚Äù  Emma stared straight into my eyes.  ‚ÄúNo one except‚Ä¶Osvald.‚Äù

‚ÄúOsvald came up with that name?‚Äù  

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Emma said.  ‚ÄúIt was an attempt to belittle me.  Emmalinde is a prestigious name in Brenione.  By shortening it to Emma, he stripped it of that prestige, of its stature.  To remind me that I was no longer a princess.  I was just a prisoner.‚Äù  She hugged her knees tighter.

Ugh.  I‚Äôve always been bad at emotionally comforting people.  Everything I do or say feels so awkward.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs rough, Emma.‚Äù  I slapped my forehead.  ‚ÄúShit, I‚Äôve probably been making you feel bad calling you that, huh?‚Äù

Emma‚Äîfuck, Emmalinde‚Äîsmiled sadly at me.  ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs quite alright.  I know you mean it as a term of endearment.  The name Emma may have once been tied to a terrible memory, but you have turned it into a pleasant one.  When I hear the name Emma, I will only think of my beloved.‚Äù  

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I said awkwardly.  ‚ÄúUm, cool.‚Äù

‚ÄúQuite.‚Äù  Emma leaned her head against my shoulder and closed her eyes.  Tears formed in the corners of her eyes but she dabbed them away with a monogrammed handkerchief.  It looked like it had a single letter on it‚Äîa B?  For Brenione, probably.  She opened her eyes and admired the sun some more.  ‚ÄúSo many awful memories because of that dreadful count.  But now I‚Äôll be able to create countless good ones with you, Mike.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight‚Ä¶‚Äù I said.  Damn it, she was falling for me and failing for me *hard.*  Getting her to move out was going to be impossible now.  Dan was going to be pissed.

Emma continued, unaware of my internal dilemma.  ‚ÄúMy mother passed when I was born.  Father told me I had older siblings but that they had all either passed as well or left to other kingdoms due to marriage.  I suppose that is why he forbid me from leaving the castle.  I spent a lot of time alone in my room, only leaving for the occasional gala I snuck into.  Then Count Osvald began stealing me away and imprisoning me on his ship until I was rescued and returned to the castle.  Back and forth between the two, one prison to another.  The only escape I ever had was the stories I read.  Fairy tales of heroes slaying dragons and rescuing the princess.  Each and every one of them ended the same‚Äî*‚Äôand they all lived happily ever after.‚Äô*  

‚ÄúFor far too long I wondered when a brave knight who save me, when he would take me away to live out our days happily ever after.‚Äù  She cupped the sides of my face in her hands and stared into my eyes, her own on the verge of tears again.  ‚ÄúAnd now I have it right here with you.  The happily ever after I‚Äôve longed for is right in front of me.  And I‚Äôm so excited to start living it.‚Äù  She gently kissed me, tears streaming down her face as she allowed herself to open her heart to me, to finally be vulnerable after escaping her prison.

And all my stupid ass could think about was how I was going to break the news to her that I couldn‚Äôt marry her.  Seriously, what the hell did I do to make God mad at me?

I broke the kiss and gulped.  ‚ÄúI mean, the stories always end with ‚Äòhappily ever after‚Äô but you know it doesn‚Äôt end there, right?‚Äù

Emma looked at me puzzled.  ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúThe stories just always kind of end but life‚Äôs not like that.  Life keeps going.  Happily ever after is the easy part‚Äîthe hard part is what comes *after* happily ever after.‚Äù

The princess seemed even more confused by my words.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand.  The hero slays the dragon.  He rescues the princess.  They fall in love.  Happily ever after!  What could be hard about that?‚Äù

I rubbed the back of my neck.  ‚ÄúWell, life‚Äôs more complicated than that.  Couples still face problems together.  They argue, they get mad at each other.  Love doesn‚Äôt just fix all your problems.  Love takes work.  A lot of it.‚Äù

The weight of my words seemed to finally sink in for Emma.  She looked down at the ground sadly, saying nothing.

I sighed.  ‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶I just wanted to make sure you understood what you were getting into.  Didn‚Äôt want you to have a bunch of expectations and get let down.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see,‚Äù she said, still looking at the ground.  She finally looked at me again with renewed determination.  ‚ÄúWell, it doesn‚Äôt matter.  We will face whatever trials come our way and defeat them.  Because our love can conquer anything.‚Äù  She took my hands in her and gave a big smile.  ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that right, my hero?‚Äù

Aw crap.  Yeah, I knew what I had to do but I didn‚Äôt like it.  ‚ÄúLook, Emma we need to talk.  I‚Äî‚Äù My confession was interrupted by the sound of my cellphone going off.  Emma quickly let go of my hands and recoiled at the sound.  ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúThought I muted that.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, yes,‚Äù a horrified Emma said.  ‚ÄúJust make that awful little box stop making that atrocious sound.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, yeah.‚Äù  I took my phone out of my pocket.  Dan was the one calling.  I answered the call.  ‚ÄúHey, Dan.  The Chinese food get here?  Seemed pretty fast.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Dan nervously.  ‚ÄúQuick question, what are you and the princess doing?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm,‚Äù I said a little confused.  ‚ÄúHaving a picnic?  On the roof?‚Äù

‚ÄúCool,‚Äù Dan replied.  I could practically here him sweating.  ‚ÄúHey, can you guys come down here a sec?  We sorta have some guests.‚Äù

‚ÄúGuests?  Who?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Äî‚Äù Dan‚Äôs reply was interrupted by the muffled sounds of someone grabbing the phone.  Another voice answered, one gruffer and angrier‚Äîone that sounded familiar.

‚ÄúKing Ardnoth Brenione,‚Äù said the king of Brenione and Emma‚Äôs father.  ‚ÄúAnd I have come to see my daughter, you *thief.*‚Äù

‚ÄúOh shit,‚Äù I mumbled.  ‚ÄúUh, right, yeah, we‚Äôll be right down there.  See you in a bit.‚Äù  I quickly hung up.  Emma was still smiling at me, her head tilted quizzically.

‚ÄúWhat is it, love?‚Äù

***

Emma and I rushed down to the apartment as quickly as we could.  Dan was sweating buckets on our couch while the king and his knights stood in our living room.  The king was a dour looking guy with the same golden hair as his daughter.  For someone who‚Äôs youngest child was in her twenties, he looked pretty young.  Perk of being super rich, I‚Äôm guessing.  The moment Emma and I walked in he glared in our direction and closed the space between us.

‚ÄúWell, well,‚Äù said the king, his voice deep and commanding.  ‚ÄúI believe when I sent you to rescue my daughter, it was under the implicit agreement that you would return her to me, not kidnap her yourself.‚Äù

I started sweating as much as Dan was.  ‚ÄúUm, I can explain.‚Äù

‚ÄúSave it!‚Äù the king barked.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky I‚Äôm just glad my daughter is safe and unharmed.  I could have you executed for this!‚Äù

Emma jumped in between us.  ‚ÄúFather, please!  This isn‚Äôt Mike‚Äôs fault!  It was my idea to come here!‚Äù

The king reeled back in shock.  ‚ÄúWhat?  Why would you do such a rash and foolish thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I love him, Father!‚Äù

The king narrowed his eyes.  ‚ÄúYou *what?*‚Äù  He turned his ire back on me.  It was like white hot knives were burrowing through my skull.  I was starting to become very aware of the four dudes with swords in my apartment.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said Emma as she grabbed my arm.  ‚ÄúI love him and I want to spend the rest of my life with him.‚Äù

His focus remained on me, his stare getting somehow even more intense.  ‚ÄúIs this true?‚Äù he asked me.  I only responded with a nervous laugh.

Emma continued.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I ran off without telling you.  But I had to follow my heart.  I know it comes from a place of love but you‚Äôve cooped me up in the castle all my life.  I want to see the world!  I have obtained a ‚Äòjob‚Äô and paid ‚Äòrent.‚Äô  I‚Äôve even learned to cook!‚Äù

Dan mumbled to himself ‚ÄúAll very debatable‚Ä¶‚Äù

Emma didn‚Äôt seem to notice.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had so many wonderful experiences since I arrived here, Father.  And I wish to have even more with my beloved.  Can you not just be happy for us?‚Äù

The king pinched the bridge of his nose, holding back what was probably a tirade riddled with fantasy swear words.  ‚ÄúEmmalinde, we have a come a long way to come and find you.  Do you understand the complicated divinations we had to perform to find you?  To open a portal here?‚Äù

I cut in.  ‚ÄúI thought you guys hated magic?‚Äù

The king turned back to me again.  ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù

‚ÄúMagic,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúYour kingdom hates magic.  Your daughter here can‚Äôt even look at Dan‚Äôs phone without freaking out.‚Äù

Dan was putting on a big fake smile.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bring me into this,‚Äù he said with clenched teeth.

The king was silent as he stepped closer to me.  I very quickly realized how much he towered over me.  ‚ÄúYou are correct,‚Äù the king said.  ‚ÄúMagic is forbidden in Brenione.  It is an abomination against the laws of nature.  We only resorted to using it out of desperation.  Had you simply returned my daughter like you were *told to*, we would not have had to resort to such *drastic measures*.‚Äù

‚ÄúY-yeah,‚Äù I stuttered.  ‚ÄúW-well, that‚Äôs‚Ä¶fair.‚Äù

The king was inches away from my face.  ‚ÄúYou should be careful what you say to me, boy.  I am a forgiving man but even my patience has its limits.‚Äù

‚ÄúNoted,‚Äù I said.  I think a little pee came out.  ‚ÄúFor the record, I didn‚Äôt mean to keep Emma here so long, it just‚Äî‚Äù

The king interrupted.  ‚ÄúWhat did you call her?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe called me Emma,‚Äù the princess chimed in.  ‚ÄúIt is a term of endearment.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is a mockery of a proud Brenian name!‚Äù the king retorted.  

‚ÄúWell, I like it!‚Äù Emma shouted.  ‚ÄúIt makes me happy when he calls me Emma!‚Äù

The king just shook his head in frustration.  ‚ÄúYou may call yourself whatever you like, Emmalinde‚Äîas long as you do it at the castle.‚Äù  The king grabbed his daughter‚Äôs arm.  ‚ÄúWe are leaving.  *Now.*‚Äù

Emma pulled her arm away.  ‚ÄúI am not going anywhere.  I am staying right here with my betrothed.‚Äù

I thought the king was going to explode.  ‚ÄúThis is not up for discussion.  You.  Are.  Coming.  *Home.*‚Äù

Emma just stood there silently, unmoving.  The father and daughter stood there like statues.  I glanced over to Dan who gave me a look that screamed *do something.*  So I did.

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúYour Highness, with all due respect, your daughter is fully grown.  Shouldn‚Äôt she be able to make her own choices?  Don‚Äôt you want her happiness?‚Äù

My mediating words seemed to have little effect on the king.  ‚ÄúYou do not understand the situation, boy.  Do not speak as if you do.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, what is it then?‚Äù I asked.  ‚ÄúWhy is it so impossible for her to make her own choices?‚Äù

The king frowned at me a little bit more before letting out a deep sigh.  ‚ÄúFine then.  I suppose it is about time for my daughter to hear this.‚Äù  The king turned his back to us and stepped away.  ‚ÄúBrenione has been at war for many decades now.  Long before I was born, when my grandfather ruled.  The enemy lives far beyond our borders and are masters of the dark arts.  The horror they‚Äôve inflicted on our people with their terrible sorcery is the reason for our hatred of magic.  But among the foulest of magics they‚Äôve performed was the curse they cast upon the royal family.‚Äù  He turned to look at Emma.  ‚ÄúOn you.‚Äù  

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù Emma asked.

The king turned away and continued.  ‚ÄúOur enemy attempted to shake our resolve by creating a crisis in its leadership.  They cursed the royal line so that all children who shared my blood would pass away at a young age.  Your siblings all were consumed by the curse.  And so too will you unless we find a cure.‚Äù

Emma‚Äôs breath was caught in her throat for a moment.  ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I am cursed to die?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said the king softly.  He turned to us and gently held his daughter‚Äôs hands.  ‚ÄúI had kept this secret from you to avoid burdening you.  But I realize that was wrong.  You deserved to know the truth.  I am sorry, Emmalinde.‚Äù

Emma turned away from her father.  ‚ÄúHow long?  How long until‚Ä¶‚Äù

The king sighed.  ‚ÄúIt is hard to say.  A few years, maybe.  We discovered that exposure to the sun worsens the curse.  It is why I have kept you inside the castle.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I see,‚Äù the princess said.  Her knees started to wobble.  ‚ÄúThat makes sense.  I had felt myself getting weaker since I arrived here.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù I asked.  ‚ÄúYou seemed fine to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is true,‚Äù Emma said.  ‚ÄúI thought I was overcome with my love for you.  But now it is clear it is the result of that curse.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess‚Ä¶‚Äù I said.  I swore she had seemed the exact same since we met her.  Hell, she had been dancing almost the entire time she was here.  But then again, I had been pretty focused on getting her out of the apartment.  I guess I missed the signs.  

Wow, I sound terrible when you put it like that.

Dan finally chimed in.  ‚ÄúHow come you never mentioned any of this curse stuff when you told us to save her?  I feel like it would have been relevant then.‚Äù

The king scowled at Dan.  ‚ÄúWell, I didn‚Äôt think it would be important since you were *supposed to bring her back right away.*‚Äù

Dan gave a nervous thumbs up.  ‚ÄúStill mad about that, huh?  Got it, shutting up now.‚Äù

The king turned back to his daughter.  ‚ÄúI understand how stifling life in the castle can be.  But it is for your own protection.  And I have good news‚ÄîI believe we have found a cure.  Or at least a way to mitigate the curse.‚Äù

Emma gasped.  ‚ÄúYou have?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.  But you need to return home so we may perform the ritual.  And you will need to stay in Brenione while we monitor the curse.‚Äù

Emma closed her eyes.  ‚ÄúI understand.  But‚Ä¶‚Äù  She looked into her father‚Äôs eyes.  ‚ÄúBut if that is the case, then I demand that we allow Mike to stay at the castle with us.‚Äù

The king shook his head.  ‚ÄúI cannot allow this.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen I will not go!‚Äù

‚ÄúEmmalinde, if you do not come home you will perish!‚Äù

‚ÄúI do not care!‚Äù  Emma grabbed my arm and pulled me close.  ‚ÄúBeing without my love would be a fate worse than death!  I do not fear this wretched curse because the love we share can conquer anything!‚Äù  Emma looked to me.  ‚ÄúTell him, Mike.  Tell him the strength of our love.‚Äù

I froze.  Everyone was looking at me, waiting for my answer.  I knew what I had to say but *God* was it going to suck.  I tried to respond but couldn‚Äôt find my voice.

Emma noticed immediately.  ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù

I sighed and grabbed her hands.  ‚ÄúWe need to talk.‚Äù

‚ÄúAbout what?‚Äù

I grimaced.  ‚ÄúThe thing is‚Ä¶‚Äù God, I hated breakups.  Especially ones where I had to tell them we were never really together in the first place.  ‚ÄúEmma, the truth is‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt come with you.‚Äù

Emma‚Äôs face paled.  ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, you‚Äôre a wonderful girl.  I just‚Ä¶‚Äù I shrugged.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre too different.  We come from different worlds.  You need to return home.  And I belong here.  I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

Tears welled up in Emma‚Äôs eyes.  ‚ÄúBut what about our love?‚Äù

I sighed even deeper.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the thing.  I‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not in love with you.  I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù  Dan flinched when I said that.  The guards looked uncomfortable.  The king just watched us stoically.

Emma blinked back the tears.  ‚ÄúNo.  No, that can‚Äôt be true.  You told me you loved me!‚Äù

I held up a finger.  ‚ÄúSee, that‚Äôs actually not true.  I never told you I loved you.  You just kinda assumed that.‚Äù

Emma looked at me aghast.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶but you‚Ä¶‚Äù  She thought for a moment, the despair evident on her face.  ‚Äú‚Ä¶you‚Äôve never said I love you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry,‚Äù I said, squeezing her hands.  ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôll find a handsome duke or count to marry.  Maybe even a baron.‚Äù  I turned to Dan.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs better than a duke, right?‚Äù  Dan just shrugged.

Emma diverted her gaze away from me.  ‚ÄúI see.  I understand.  Thank you for your honesty.‚Äù  A single tear rolled down her cheek.  Damn.  I know I had to do it but it still sucks.

The king put a hand on Emma‚Äôs shoulder.  ‚ÄúI am sorry, Emmalinde.  This is why I did my best to protect you from the outside world.  It can be cruel to a girl as kind as you.  Are you ready to leave?‚Äù

Emma wiped away her tears.  ‚Äú‚Ä¶yes, father.‚Äù

‚ÄúVery well.  Let us be off.‚Äù  The knights escorted the king and princess out of our apartment.  Before they left, the king stood in the doorway.  ‚ÄúThank you for rescuing my daughter, Mike, Son of Peter.  However, should we require another hero‚Äî‚Äù The king shot me one last glare.  ‚ÄúI do not think we will summon you.‚Äù  With that, they left.  A few moments later and a there was a green flash of light and a warbling sound as the king opened a portal home and stepped inside, Emma following.  Dan and I shared an uneasy glance.  We had finally gotten Emma out of the apartment like we planned to.

So why didn‚Äôt we feel happy about it?

***

Dan grabbed me a beer and joined me on the couch.  He turned on a movie and we drank in silence.  The events of the other day still weighed on my mind.  Emma‚Äôs heartbroken look was seared into my brain.  It was the right call for everyone in the end.  So why did I still feel so bad?

I finally broke the silence.  ‚ÄúDo you think we made a mistake?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Dan asked.  ‚ÄúWith Emma?  No!  We‚Äôve been tryin‚Äô to get her out of here all week!‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúBut still.  Something just feels off.‚Äù

Dan shrugged.  ‚ÄúOkay, sure, her dad was kind of a dick.  But as far as he knew, we *did* kidnap his daughter.  Besides, that curse was going to kill her if she stayed!  Far as I‚Äôm concerned, we were helping her.‚Äù

I shook my head.  ‚ÄúBut doesn‚Äôt it feel a little too convenient?  Emma just so happened to have a curse her dad never mentioned before that makes it so she has to come back home?  Like, what kind of curse is that?  It just feels so contrived.‚Äù

‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù Dan said with sweeping gestures.  ‚ÄúMike, your *life* is one contrivance after another.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúUsually it makes my life *more* difficult, not *less.*  Something‚Äôs up.‚Äù

Dan took a swig.  ‚ÄúWell, not like it matters.  We weren‚Äôt convincing her dad and he had armed soldiers.  And even if we wanted to bring her back‚Äîwhich I can‚Äôt say I do‚Äîwe don‚Äôt have a way to go to her world.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I took another drink.  ‚ÄúI just feel bad for her.  Spending all her life cooped inside.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Dan said sarcastically.  ‚ÄúStuck in a giant castle all day, waited on hand and foot.  Sounds terrible.‚Äù  Dan put a hand on my shoulder.  ‚ÄúLook, you tried your best but it wasn‚Äôt meant to be.  What‚Äôs important is that she‚Äôs alive.‚Äù

I considered his words and let out a sigh.  ‚ÄúYeah, I guess so.‚Äù

‚ÄúBesides, could be worse.  At least that pirate guy hasn‚Äôt kidnapped her.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù  I thought back to her words.  About growing up in the castle all alone and cut off from the world.  And about her time as a prisoner of the count‚Äôs, watching sunsets and seeing flowers.  Was the castle actually better than Osvald‚Äôs ship?  ‚ÄúMaybe‚Ä¶‚Äù

There was a loud banging on the door.  Dan and I just looked at each other.  Another round of banging.  ‚ÄúYou expecting guests?‚Äù Dan asked.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúBut when am I ever?  If it‚Äôs someone wanting to go on a quest, tell ‚Äòem to go home.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, yeah.‚Äù  Dan got up and the banging continued even louder.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm comin‚Äô, I‚Äôm comin‚Äô!  Calm down.‚Äù  He opened the door and immediately tried to shut it.  ‚ÄúOh fuck!‚Äù  The door slammed open, smashing Dan between the door and the wall.  Standing in the doorway, disheveled, desperate, and pointing a wand at me, was Count Osvald.

‚ÄúYou again!‚Äù I shouted as I jumped to my feet.  ‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing here?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere is she?‚Äù Osvald said.  The formerly prestigious count had really let himself go since I last saw him.  His ponytail was still unraveled from our fight, his clothes were wrinkled and unwashed, and he definitely hadn‚Äôt slept in a while.  He was looking at me with a lot of hate and, coupled with the wand crackling with energy aimed at me, I was getting a little nervous for my safety.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said as I put my hands up.  ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just be cool, man.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know she‚Äôs here,‚Äù Osvald asked, rejecting my offer to be cool.  ‚ÄúI saw her follow after you through that portal.  Where.  Is.  She?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou mean Emma?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúTsk.  You have some nerve referring to a princess in such a casual manner?‚Äù

I scoffed at him.  ‚ÄúYou mean like you do?‚Äù

‚ÄúSilence!‚Äù Osvald shouted (ironic).  ‚ÄúDo not speak to me that way!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat way?‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúThe way where I call out what a weird hypocrite you are?‚Äù  It had been a rough couple days and I wasn‚Äôt going to let some jackass bust into my home and order me around.  Even if he was capable of killing me with magic.

‚ÄúInsolent welp!‚Äù  Osvald jabbed the wand at me, sparks dancing off the crystal at the end of it.  ‚ÄúNeed I remind you that I am armed?  Another insult from you and I‚Äôll blast a hole in your chest!‚Äù  As Osvald mean mugged me, Dan squeezed out from behind the door and snatched the wand out of his hand.  He threw it out the door and somewhere into the parking lot of the apartment complex.  Osvald stared in the direction of the wand for a moment.  ‚ÄúDammit,‚Äù he mumbled.  

‚ÄúYou should get a wrist strap for that,‚Äù Dan said.  ‚ÄúWorked well for the Wii.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need a ‚Äòwrist strap‚Äô,‚Äù said the man who absolutely needed a wrist strap.  ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt need my wand.  I‚Äôm still a master swordsman and I‚Äî‚Äù Osvald reached for his belt and saw no sword.  ‚ÄúWhat do you mean I left it on the ship?!?‚Äù

‚ÄúWow,‚Äù Dan said.  ‚ÄúThis is just embarrassing, man.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúNow I kinda feel bad.‚Äù 

Osvald grabbed his face with both hands and let out a frustrated groan.  ‚ÄúNo matter!  In the arena of unarmed combat, I have the upper hand!‚Äù

‚ÄúDan,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúThink you can hold him off while I walk five steps to the closet and grab the golf club?‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably,‚Äù Dan replied.

Osvald just looked back between Dan and I, doing the mental math in his head about his chances of victory.  They must not have been in his favor because he just stood there grinding his teeth. 

‚ÄúSo, we good?‚Äù I asked.  ‚ÄúCause I was really enjoying my movie.‚Äù

Osvald just laughed.  ‚ÄúNo.  In fact, you‚Äôve forced my hand.  Surrender the princess to me this instant or I shall return to my ship and blast your domicile to smithereens!‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said placating.  ‚ÄúThat feels a scooch too far.

Dan just looked at the count unimpressed.  ‚ÄúDo it.‚Äù

Osvald blinked in surprise.  ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo it,‚Äù Dan repeated.  ‚ÄúPut your money where your mouth is.‚Äù

‚ÄúDan, don‚Äôt encourage him!‚Äù

Osvald puffed out his chest a bit.  ‚ÄúI will!‚Äù he blustered.  

Dan gestured to the doorway.  ‚ÄúGo right ahead.‚Äù

The three of us just stood there in the living room of the apartment.  Osvald had talked a big game but suddenly he looked nervous.  After what felt like forever, Osvald just sighed.  ‚ÄúFine.  You‚Äôve called my bluff.  I couldn‚Äôt risk the princess ending up caught in the crossfire.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell yeah,‚Äù said Dan.  ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt risk blowing up the girl I‚Äôm in love with either.‚Äù

Osvald‚Äôs face turned pale.  ‚ÄúWhat did you just say to me, worm?‚Äù

Dan shrugged.  ‚ÄúI mean, you‚Äôre totally in love with Emmalinde.  That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre kidnapping here.  Like, its *so* obvious.‚Äù

The count just stammered.  ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI‚Ä¶how *dare* you?!?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, he‚Äôs right,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúHonestly, if I had really dedicated some time to it, I would have figured that out too.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is preposterous!‚Äù said Osvald.  ‚ÄúI am a villain.  We do not *love*.‚Äù  

Dan was bewildered.  ‚ÄúDude, what?  That‚Äôs the motivation of, like, 40% of villains.‚Äù  Dan started counting on his hands.  ‚ÄúDarth Vader, Dracula, Bowser.  This is totally a trope.‚Äù

Osvald narrowed his eyes at Dan.  ‚ÄúI have no idea who any of those people are.‚Äù

Dan just laughed.  ‚ÄúHey man, I can pop in *Super Mario* right now.  You want 2-D or 3-D?  Pick your preference.‚Äù

Osvald buried his face in his hands.  ‚ÄúThis is ridiculous.  I am not in love with Princess Emmalinde.‚Äù

I smirked.  ‚ÄúThen why‚Äôd you take her to a field of flowers at sunset?‚Äù

‚ÄúDude, what?‚Äù said Dan with a chuckle.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs romantic as hell.  Ozzy‚Äôs got game.‚Äù  

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I continued.  ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt even lock her in her cell much.  Hell, he‚Äôs the one who called her Emma first.‚Äù

‚ÄúOoh, pet name,‚Äù Dan said with a shit eating grin.  ‚ÄúClassic sign of affection.‚Äù

Osvald had gone from pale to red in the face.  ‚ÄúIt was an insult!  I was simply stripping her of her status!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah,‚Äù Dan said with a raised eyebrow.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you wanted to strip her alright.  Heyo!‚Äù  Dan put a hand up for a high five.  Osvald just gawked at him so Dan high fived himself.  

Osvald took a second to calm himself down.  ‚Äú‚Ä¶I am not engaging in this idiotic conversation one second longer.  You will deliver me the princess this instant!‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, no,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna do that for a lot of reasons, the biggest one being that you‚Äôre a dick.  Secondly, she‚Äôs not here right now.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, fine!‚Äù Osvald said.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just go find her and when I do, I‚Äôll‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúKidnap her?‚Äù Dan asked.  ‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôll win her over.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am not trying to win her over!‚Äù Osvald pleaded.

‚ÄúDude,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just us.  You can admit it.  No judgement here.‚Äù

Osvald looked at me with disgust and confusion.  ‚ÄúHow in the world did I lose to an idiot like you?‚Äù

I shrugged.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm shockingly good at this.‚Äù

Dan placed an arm around Osvald.  ‚ÄúLook, man, I get it.  We all want our crush to like us back.  We‚Äôve all been there.  But trust me, kidnapping her ain‚Äôt gonna make her love you back.  She totally hates you, bro, and she fell head over heels for Mike.  It‚Äôs over.  Just move on.‚Äù

Osvald tried to respond but there was only silence.  He stared at the floor, pondering Dan‚Äôs words and his own situation.  Finally, without looking up at me, he quietly asked ‚Äúdoes she love you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúDid Emma‚Äîdid Princess Emmalinde truly fall in love with you?‚Äù

I hesitated as I remembered how I broke her heart.  I don‚Äôt think she was in love with me anymore after that.  But if it stopped Osvald from kidnapping her anymore‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYeah.  She‚Äôs in love with me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see.‚Äù  Osvald turned around and started walking out.  ‚ÄúThen I shall leave her with you.  I will never bother her again.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry, dude,‚Äù Dan said.  ‚ÄúPlenty of fish in the sea.‚Äù

Before Osvald took his last step out the door, he turned to me and said ‚ÄúJust promise me you‚Äôll protect her.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure thing,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm pretty sure her dad has that covered.‚Äù

Osvald spun around, staring at me in shock.  ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù

‚ÄúHer dad took her home the other day,‚Äù I said.  

Osvald stared at me with his mouth agape.  ‚ÄúYou let Emma return to the castle?‚Äù  

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶yeah?‚Äù

Osvald started shaking.  Suddenly, his face became a scowl and he snarled at me.  ‚ÄúYou bastard!  I‚Äôll kill you!‚Äù  He lunged towards my throat.

‚ÄúJesus!‚Äù  I grappled with Osvald trying to keep him from crushing my windpipe.  Dan made a mad dash to the closet and grabbed the golf club I didn‚Äôt break.  He sprinted at Osvald and struck him in the back.  The count released my neck and Dan struck him another time.

‚ÄúBro!‚Äù Dan shouted, raising the club in the air in preparation of another swing.  ‚ÄúChill!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou idiots!‚Äù Osvald screamed, holding his injured back.  ‚ÄúDo you realize what you‚Äôve done?!?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your deal?!?‚Äù I shouted back.  ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so bad about giving her back home?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time for this!‚Äù Osvald said as he got up and he rushed for the door.  ‚ÄúI need to save her!‚Äù

‚ÄúSave her?‚Äù I asked.  ‚ÄúFrom who?‚Äù

Osvald just gave me the most condescending look imaginable.  ‚ÄúFrom King Ardnoth, you simpletons!  I need to save her from her father!‚Äù",1,1734756360.0,mikesonofpeter,1,1.0,False

Not for nothing is Katrina Kaif known as Bollywood‚Äôs safest bet; its blockbuster queen has starred in mega hits alongside Akshay Kumar, Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and Hrithik Roshan. But just when she was on top of her game ‚Äì and had given big hits in Tiger Zinda Hai and Jagga Jasoos, she began to get her feet wet as an entrepreneur.

Now, every other actor has investments in some business or the other. But for Katrina Kaif, launching her own beauty line, Kay Beauty, five years ago came from a long-held dream. ‚ÄúIt comes from a very genuine space,‚Äù she tells me. We are at a Bandra restaurant as she sips on her coffee (black, obviously), celebrating five years of Kay.***‚ÄúPeople often ask me why I launched my own business, and one thing I say is that it came from my heart. Authenticity connects you to your audience, or what people in business say, to your consumer. Your audience can sense something that‚Äôs not great, and they can sense something that comes from a real space. Makeup has been my passion, the confidence it gives you is so personal and transformative.‚Äù***

Kaif has found an excellent partner in Falguni Nayar of Nykaa, and Falguni‚Äôs daughter Adwaita. Kay Beauty is a brand owned by Nykaa and Kaif.***It has been profitable from its first year thanks to its easy prices and has won over the most hard-nosed beauty critics courtesy great quality.***

The actor has been fully hands-on; she‚Äôs involved with campaigns, packaging, social media, press releases et al. ***‚ÄúI work closely with Falguni and Adwaita and have their full respect,‚Äù she smiles. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve learned so much from them and their team, I‚Äôm really not a numbers person but now I have a better understanding of how we create something. They‚Äôve empowered me so much. We can do anything, the sky's the limit.‚Äù***

Katrina Kaif has been an actor for well over two decades and an entrepreneur for five years. How are the two passions different? ‚ÄúThe process of being an actor is so much about letting go of yourself. It‚Äôs about blending into another character. As an entrepreneur, it is so different. I get to get involved with technical aspects and innovation. I‚Äôm really opinionated but being in business has taught me to listen.‚Äù

The actor became a businesswoman while she was at the top of the Bollywood ladder. The beauty business is not a second coming for Katrina Kaif, it‚Äôs almost like a parallel career.

***""In the beginning, it was definitely challenging,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúEven now my husband asks me to put down the phone and I want to send just one more email. When you‚Äôre on a movie set, you have a schedule. You are gone from 9 am to 9 pm; he knows where I am and I know where he is. But when you are a business owner there's no schedule. You have to set down rules. Otherwise, you can go on sending emails. But I‚Äôve learned the importance of setting guidelines.‚Äù***

Kaif says she knew she wanted to be in the makeup business all along. ‚ÄúI know I wanted to say to women and to men about how we look, about ideas of beauty, and physical appearance and self-acceptance. Makeup was my way of communicating. It has been an important journey of my confidence and self-image. I‚Äôm learning what I need to learn through my journey as an entrepreneur.‚Äù

When someone with the impossible beauty of Kaif talks about issues with her self-image, she normalises self-doubt for her countless fans too.***‚ÄúI completely struggle with self-acceptance. Things are not what they seem on the surface, that has been one of the savings, or learnings of my life. When you are struggling with something it seems like you are drowning and everyone else is thriving. But that‚Äôs not the way it is. Things are not what they seem, you have to pick yourself up and you have to keep fighting. Life is going to give you moments of ups and downs but you have to find your way,‚Äù she confesses.***

In her personal life, Kaif says she doesn‚Äôt wear makeup unless she‚Äôs going out. ‚ÄúBut even then I want to feel like my skin is breathing. I don‚Äôt want to feel anything weighty. Like our creme blush, or the eye crayon pencil, maybe some concealer and our lip tint with honey. ***Just something natural looking. I‚Äôm equally passionate about skincare, because I have very sensitive skin. I enjoy fun routines, like the gua sha. I know I‚Äôm late to the party, but I‚Äôve just started using it and it‚Äôs amazing. My mother-in-law also makes me this hair oil with onion, amla, avocado and two-three other ingredients. Home remedies are incredibly powerful too.‚Äù***

She says her husband, actor Vicky Kaushal, and she never fight for counter space in the bathroom. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs very adjusting and understanding,‚Äù she laughs.

With Kay Beauty‚Äôs incredible success, are films on the back foot now? ‚ÄúDefinitely not,‚Äù she asserts. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an actor and that‚Äôs a part of my being. Being on a film set, creating cinema, is magical. It will always be there with me.‚Äù

1hj2c5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/videogames/comments/1hj2c5o/my_review_of_portrait_of_ruin_still_not_above_an/,"My Review of Portrait of Ruin. Still not above an 8/10, but more enjoyable than Dawn of Sorrow and Aria of Sorrow.","# Let me state that, having played Aos and Dos, I HAVE enjoyed both of them, and even committed to the boss rushes and new game plus.

# However with Portrait of Ruin, I had more fun.

# There are, however, flaws.

# So let's talk about the bad before we get to the good.

Luck/Grinding: To kill a Demon 200 times to get FOUR Super Tonics, or to kill certain enemies dozens to hundreds of times over to get a specific item.

The Luck Stat was supposed to be BETTER in Portrait compared to the Sorrow series where you kill peeping eye 30 times in AoS to get its soul, or the Creature 50 times in Dawn of Sorrow to get its soul.

So unfortunately, even if you level up close to level 80, luck is NOT on your side.

The Quests: I love and hate the quests because they make some of them so difficult or push you away from doing certain things.

The Miser Ring has the power to surpass the Headhunter from AoS. But it requires 100K gold per increase in stats. Now then....suppose you do new game plus? You'll have to deplete your currency once again to get a second miser ring. Worth it though, so I recommend purchasing multiple master rings and the like.

The Spin quests are hard to pull off, and part of the reason I had issues with Circle of the moon. You might not even be using those techniques either.

Most of the quests with the best items take place in the last 80-99% of the game...let me repeat. You won't get an item speeding up charlotte's spells, all of charlotte's spells, the rapid regen MP ring, or the best team attack until the practically end of the game.  
AFTER you defeat Brauner, the second to last boss.  
With Circle of the moon,you just needed to put ""MAGICIAN"" as your title, and you could start with all of the spell cards.  
Here, you have to explore every nook and cranny of the game in order to get to the Nest Of Evil to get the final quests.

At least with new game plus, you don't have to do it all over again, and the maps remain completed. But the nest of evil still remains locked until late to end game. AFTER you defeat the 2nd to final boss.

The Subweapons...

I'm fine with the master ring costing 200K gold to get....what I'm NOT fine with is how many weapons you're required to master when it requires 1500-2000 kills/skill points. Between the grinding for items and leveling up the subweapons, I was able to reach level 80 on THOSE ALONE. At least you KEEP all those masteries in new game plus.

The cakes in 13th Street. In the initial game, you need TWO gold rings if you want to collect all the cakes. Strange in that New Game Plus, you can only collet 1 new game from 13th Street.

Now we move onto charlotte.  
Her spells are awesome, but too easy to interrupt, and take too much time to charge until you get the sorceress crest. It makes it harder to appreciate using her for most of the game unless you heavily level up to at least 70.

And that Sanctuary spell was a nightmare to pull off against the Lecarde sisters. Its doable, not impossible, but rough!

Next...the nest of evil...imagine leveling up to level 80 because you grinded for different items ,spells, and level up subweapons...now in the nest of Evil, you STILL need to grind for MORE items to complete quests.  
And somehow, the enemies can still kill you. The cave troll's electric attack took down my 1000+ health bar in mere seconds...

# Well, that's the flaws....let's talk about the good.

First, the spoiled foods/toxic foods. In new game plus, these become invaluable in getting the Miser Ring by reducing health in front of vincent.

The skull ring or mask whatever curses you, allowing you to do the same with MP.

So the game DOES give you the means to achieve that quest a second time.

Which leads us to The Miser Ring.

In the first game alone, whether grinding on high level enemies who drop valuable weapons, o getting the Gold Rings, it IS time consuming but worthwhile if you want to grind several million gold, as the Miser Ring SURPASSES the Headhunter Soul from AoS.

In New game Plus? Two of those rings? Charlotte becomes a goddess who can shrug off dracula's ultimate and one-shot bosses with spells alone. it makes you basically Saitama but with magic and weapons. Which makes New Game Plus quite fun!

Speaking of Charlotte. One issue I had with Circle of the Moon was how hard it was to pull off button combinations for most of the card spells. Though I do appreciate the Magician Mode that let me start the game with them. With Charlotte you not only have tons of options with spells, your tomes, while limited like your spells compared to Jonathan, are still quite fun. And in New Game plus, she's all but omnipotent with the new tools you can give her. I had so much fun using her character.

**Plus its nice to give girls the option to play as a female character whose intelligence is praised by friend and foe alike. We all know how hard it is for our family to acknowledge us and our hard work, right?**

The Order Of Ecclesia I haven't tried yet, but for now, I used Charlotte Exclusively on New Game Plus.  
Its also fun to add the challenge of having her fight Jonathan during the Astarte boss fight. Cool mechanic. And her dialogue after is...relatable? Cute?

And speaking of the boss fights...they were all more interesting, entertaining, and challenging compared to the Sorrow Bosses. For one, you had to learn their moves. Two, you had to try different strategies compared to the boss you fought before. It gave you sense of accomplishment , more so than the Soma Boss Fights. Interestingly, those bosses are in the Nest of Evil, as well as the Dark Academy as enemies. And they're somehow fun to fight this time.

Dracula as the final boss is cool because if you level up enough, you don't have to use the teamwork system to handle his ultimate. But it was a bit depressing as his ultimate form only has that and stomping on you.

But prior to that, Dracula teaming up with Death is SUCH A FUN IDEA. And it was well done.

Even leading up to that? The final boss of Nest of Evil and Brauner both are entertaining and creative to fight.

The story is fascinating and ties in multiple games in the series without the need for retcons. It humanizes Brauner without making him sympathetic.He's still awful and irredeemable, but you do understand his motives, even though its so easy to find them absolutely contemptible.

Now let's go onto weapons.  
Starting with the subweapons...SO many options.  
From the exploding crossbow to the Belmont Weapons, to the shurikens to the AURA BLAST. And the best part is that these got stronger the more you used them.

Then the actual weapons...as in AoS, the final guard gives the second to best sword, next to the royal sword. One quest gives you MAXIM'S Sword, AND you can get the Alucard spear. Lots of fun callbacks.  
Each of the weapons can be used for different options and quests. What's great is that the game requires you to try different things out.

Now for equipment.

Lots of different customizable options.Headgear, footwear, two arm options, and a weapon slot.

The gear is interesting, and you can mix and match far more options than nearly any other game

And speaking of so many options.? There's so much food!

So not only is there tons of health items, but coffee and tea can be used to replenish your MP as well!

1hj28qd,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1hj28qd/marketing_hypotheses_how_to_stop_guessing_and/,Marketing Hypotheses: How to Stop Guessing and Start Achieving Real Results,"When it comes to creating content or video, most brands share the same request: ""Make something cool that blows everyone away!"" But let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîcool videos that are ""just pretty"" rarely deliver real results. You might love the idea, but it can leave your audience completely indifferent. Why does this happen? Because while ideas inspire, hypotheses prove.

# Ideas vs. Hypotheses

Idea: ""Let‚Äôs create a video about our product, featuring beautiful people smiling at sunset. This will definitely work!""

Hypothesis: ""If we tell a real customer story and show how our product solved their problem, it will boost lead conversion by 15%.""

**Feel the difference?**

An idea is when you *think* you know what your audience wants. A hypothesis is when you *test* your assumption and measure the results with precision.

As Eric Ries put it in *The Lean Startup*: **""A hypothesis is a measurable assumption about how you can achieve a specific outcome.""** It‚Äôs not a hunch or some abstract ‚Äúwow factor‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs a scientific approach that either works or doesn‚Äôt. And here‚Äôs the beauty of it: even if a hypothesis fails, you still win because you‚Äôve learned what *not* to do.

# Why Hypotheses Are Your Secret Weapon for Video Marketing

Today, video isn‚Äôt a luxury‚Äîit‚Äôs a necessity. People consume videos faster than they drink their morning coffee. Research shows that **72% of customers prefer learning about a product through video** (according to HubSpot). But here‚Äôs the catch: not all videos convert viewers into buyers. To create videos that actually drive results, you need to figure out what truly resonates with your audience.

**This is where hypotheses become your best ally.**

Formulating a hypothesis is like putting on glasses that bring reality into focus. You stop guessing and start testing what format, style, concept, or even button color works best for your audience.

# How to Formulate Hypotheses for Video

**Step 1: Identify the customer‚Äôs problem.**

Start with a question: What pain point or desire are you addressing? For example: ‚ÄúWhy are users leaving our website without filling out the form?‚Äù

**Step 2: Propose a solution.**

Suggest a specific change to your content that you believe will improve performance.

**Example Hypothesis:**

""If we add customer testimonial videos to the website, this will build audience trust and increase conversions by 20%.""

**Step 3: Define a success metric.**

How will you measure the outcome? It could be conversion rates, audience retention in the video, or shares on social media.

# Tips for Working with Hypotheses (Tested and Proven)

1. Keep your hypotheses narrow and simple. Many marketers make the mistake of trying to solve too much at once. A good hypothesis tests one specific assumption. For instance: ‚ÄúIf we feature a unique selling proposition (USP) in the first 3 seconds of the video, audience retention will increase by 10%.‚Äù
2. Use a minimum viable video. As taught in *The Lean Startup*, test ideas on a small scale first. Instead of creating a full-scale ad, try a 15-second test video for social media. It‚Äôs quick, cost-effective, and efficient.
3. Focus on your audience‚Äôs needs. Rob Fitzpatrick in *The Mom Test* warns: never ask your audience, ‚ÄúDo you like our idea?‚Äù‚Äîbecause they‚Äôll lie to you. Instead, ask, ‚ÄúWhat problems are you facing? What recent content resonated with you?‚Äù This gets you closer to the truth.

**Example Hypothesis:**

‚ÄúIf we feature a real customer story in the video instead of generic product claims, the audience will feel more connected to the brand, and engagement will increase by 15%.‚Äù

# Experimenting with Formats

Jonah Berger in *Contagious* explains that the success of content often depends on its format.

Try testing:

1. Horizontal vs. vertical videos.
2. Animation vs. live-action.
3. Subtitled videos vs. videos without text.

**Example Hypothesis:**

‚ÄúVideos with subtitles will get 25% more views since most of our audience watches social media content without sound.‚Äù

**Learn from Failures.** Every marketer fears launching a campaign that flops. But as Eric Ries reminds us, a failed hypothesis is just another step toward growth. If something doesn‚Äôt work, you learn what *not* to do and can pivot your strategy accordingly.

# Backstory:


[üîí]


# Now:


*At Half-Blood Hill*


There was a silence that stretched across Half-Blood Hill in the evening, one that had remained undisturbed before there was a sudden rush of heated winds and a resounding *crash* as a pair of redheads fell through the trees and landed roughly at the Crest of Half-Blood Hill, the soft grass softening their landing only a little as the momentum of the fall sent them tumbling downhill.


‚ÄúOw.‚Äù Was the first utterance that came from one of the twins, discounting the string of curses that came from the other as they fell down the hill in unison


Aubrey panted as she lay across the grass, ignoring the pain from the various scrapes and bruises the fall had left her with for now as she looked around cautiously. She almost felt too exhausted to care at this point but her survival instinct still screamed at her to check if their pursuers were still on their trail.


‚ÄúYou think this is the place?‚Äù She asked her sister in a hushed whisper, wincing as she raised her head to look at the cabin area and the campfire that roared at its centre.


The person who Aubrey directed her comment to, her sister whom she had crashed into Camp Half-Blood‚Äôs hill with, was too preoccupied to answer the question. Scarlett rolled across the grass, attempting to unwind herself from the wings that she used to cushion her fall. The outline of her arms bulged from within her feathery cocoon, and the girl‚Äôs annoyed grunts and groans could be heard as she fruitlessly tried to escape her winged trap. The sounds of her heated curses and grumbles broke the hushed tone her twin had created, only helping to garner more attention to the demigod two red-heads. After a few more awkward and anger-filled moments of Scarlett‚Äôs struggle, she was finally able to break free, her face red and puffy as she gasped for air. While she recuperated from the intense cardio that just occurred, Scarlett looked around. Her matted wavy, red locks weakly bounced as she looked from side to side; getting her first glimpse of the place she hoped to call ‚Äúhome‚Äù: Camp Half-Blood. Although she never really had a home, her lifeline was always Aubrey. Nonetheless, her golden eyes zoomed from one area to another. The first thing that caught her attention was the rows of cabins nearby, which were all different colors, shapes, sizes, and appearances. She thought they looked odd. The next thing that she glanced at was the vast forests that she had seen overhead, before her descent from the sky. The last thing she looked at was the raging fire that burned within the center of Camp. 


Despite the impressive display before her, Scarlett wore a contemptuous look on her pale and sun-kissed face. The girl wore an expression akin to disgust or annoyance; a scowl across her blushed face. However, her amber eyes were unreadable, and they held a distant, far-off look within them. Nonetheless, minutes after the statement had been said, Aubrey‚Äôs earlier inquiry finally registered within her twin‚Äôs head. The girl promptly responded with a tight-lipped frown as she began to dust herself off, although the action didn‚Äôt amount to much. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if this is the place.‚Äù Scarlett immediately pauses. Her voice isn‚Äôt loud, but it‚Äôs also not quiet. When she resumes speaking, her voice is hushed, and her tone is more serious than its previous laxity. ‚ÄúBut if this isn‚Äôt Camp, I don‚Äôt think I should even say how screwed we would be because it‚Äôs already obvious.‚Äù She lets out a raspy, hearty sigh. When she speaks to her twin, she shows a vulnerable side of herself. One of weakness and fear. Her ginger eyebrows are knotted, and her teeth bite at her already peeled lips. Her tired face betrays a lack of rest: under her amber eyes are large and purple circles, beneath the torn layers of her jacket and oversized shirt that peaks beneath it are scars that vary in age and severity, and across her body are scrapes, bruises, and scabs alike. 


And her wings don‚Äôt look any better. As broad and magnificent as they might be, they were even more dirty. All sorts of debris were knotted into her reddish-brown feathers: twigs, branches, leaves, and an abundance of grass. Scarlett‚Äôs crash onto the ground only helped to worsen her appearance and her injuries. Her baggy pants were ripped at the knees, and her bare freckled legs were bright pink and bloody, although admittedly, using her wings to cushion her fall had somewhat helped. After standing still in thought for a few seconds, filling the heated air between the two with tense silence, the girl suddenly turned to her side: facing her twin sister, Aubrey. Although she wasn‚Äôt smiling, the look on her face was notably more warm than before. There was also something else there, something that was more tricky to read. Hope. ‚ÄúAubrey.,‚Äù She spoke with an oddly soothing and comforting tone. Within a blink of an eye, all of her previous bitterness, sarcasm, and anger had disappeared. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm stupid and I‚Äôm tired, and I‚Äôm not in the right headspace right now. So just forget what I said. It doesn‚Äôt matter. I‚Ä¶,‚Äù She pauses to bite her lip. ‚ÄúI was being a jerk. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù She takes a step closer to her sister, taking her hand and wiping some grass off of her shoulder. Surrounding the two burned an abnormally high heat, yet as Scarlett came into contact with this warmth, she didn‚Äôt think it was alien. Instead, she thought it was comforting. ‚ÄúBut even if I suck, I can tell you this: it doesn‚Äôt matter if this is the place or not. We‚Äôve fought and survived for this long. I won‚Äôt let anything happen to you. They won‚Äôt hurt you.‚Äù She pauses, her eyes drifting towards her sister‚Äôs injuries, then back to Aubrey‚Äôs eyes. ‚ÄúNot anymore. I swear by it.‚Äù 


Aubrey stared at her sister for a long moment, her gaze hard with lingering resentment, but it didn't take her long to deflated. She sighed, closing her eyes and her shaking head before a soft smile crept across her lips. She flicked her sister on forehead.


‚ÄúYou're fine, Scar. Last few days haven't been easy. As long as you don't keep acting like such a jerk.‚Äù She replied, stumbling a little and grabbing Scarlett‚Äôs shoulder for support ‚Äúand stop with the oaths n‚Äôall, I'm the older one remember? It's my job to protect you, plus I have the shield.‚Äù


She sighed again, looking around as it became apparent that the crash-landed pair had finally gathered some attention. Aubrey was too tired to think about her sudden ability to control the air and fly at the moment, but she suddenly felt very conscious of her appearance as she dusted off her worn-out clothes. A light flush bloomed across her pale cheeks.


In response to her sister‚Äôs words, the tiniest of smiles crept across Scarlett‚Äôs face. However, her happy look quickly disappeared as she was reminded of the severity of their situation‚Ä¶Despite the heavy words Scarlett spoke, they held little weight behind them. She swore to protect Aubrey from harm, yet there her sister was, standing before her injured, tired, and hanging onto hope. Nonetheless, whether the girl could keep her word or not, she began to wander around. ‚ÄúAnd besides, I don‚Äôt think we even have to worry. It seems like this is it. I mean, it doesn‚Äôt get more campy than this, right?‚Äù She joked even though the exhaustion in her voice was thick, and she looked like she wanted to do nothing more than collapse to the ground and succumb to sleep. Aubrey could only muster a snort in response, then groaned. Laughing hurt her bruised ribs, she was half worried that the fall might have broken something.


Scarlett‚Äôs back was hunched due to the weight of her wings, and she winced with every word she spoke. Scarlett‚Äôs body faces away from her sister, instead looking at the teenagers that roam around. Many of them wear bright orange shirts with odd-looking emblems on them, with some of the kids even stopping to gawk or stare at the twins, a few longer than others, while some people carry on with their days as if two flying teenagers crashing into a hill was a normal event. 




*At Canoe Lake*


A red-haired girl sat at the edge of canoe lake, her bare feet dipping into the surface of the frigid water as she sat there with her journal in her lap, sucking at the capped end of her ink pen. Clad in just a brown cardigan to warm her as she was, if the cold bothered her she didn't let it show, and her breath created perhaps more mist than it would were it for a normal person as she let out a sigh, staring at the blank page of her journal with a look that was part frustration and part exhaustion. She tapped her pen restlessly against the paper, as if that was gonna help her put to words the idea of the poem that was floating across her mind and consumed her every thought, though just as she was about to get up and try getting a change of scenery again, she heard the sound of footsteps approaching her.


Turning towards her visitor, she tucked the stray strands of wavy hair that covered her face to see them properly, her red hair seeming to almost glow in the winter sunlight as she closed her journal and tucked it between her arm and body again, capping and shoving her pen in the pocket of her cardigan.


""Hi there,"" She greeted, tilting her head. The exasperation from her writer's block hadn't entirely left her expression, but the look she gave her oncomer wasn't unfriendly as she greeted them ""How can I help you?""




*At The Forest* 
Wavy, red hair gave the illusion of shimmering flames as Scarlett‚Äôs body came crashing down into the frosted ground. She landed upon the forest‚Äôs floor with an echoing; loud and heavy thud. Frozen grass, twigs, and leaves alike flew around her throbbing body as she angrily hurled expletives at the gray sky above her; limbs twitching with every loud and hoarse curse she groaned. Pain was nothing new to her, although Scarlett couldn‚Äôt ignore the sharp, swelling feeling in her abdomen, and the hand that was pinned between the ground and her ripped black jacket. After tiring herself out, she laid there in exasperation, before deciding to do something about her miserable state. Placing her injured hand on her waist that stung with pain, she willed herself to sit up. Carefully inching forward, Scarlett groaned and cursed with every slow and sore movement her body made. A smoke-like, frosty cloud formed around her open mouth, although she oddly wore light sweatpants, and a short-sleeve shirt peeked through the rips of her jacket. Despite being ill-dressed for the surrounding weather, she had managed to sit up, and now she used her free arm to bat at her wings. They were dirty and broad, although soft, so she had used them to cushion her descent from the icy sky. As Scarlett smacked at her spotted reddish-brown, debris flew across her face. She squinted her eyes, and weakly plugged her nose, coughing before finally finishing her cleaning. Queerly, she was untouched by frost, and beneath her body was green grass, where the surrounding area was covered in ice. This was clearly due to her demigod abilities. Upon her arrival at Camp Half-Blood, Scarlett could freely demonstrate her powers without a care in the world. This meant she could finally practice flying. For her entire life, her wings were just an extension of herself. She would remove them if she could. They were more cumbersome than anything, requiring constant upkeep, and being the source of her back pain and bad posture. Even though flight was achievable, she wasn‚Äôt good at it; every attempt was a miserable failure. And now, after yet another unsuccessful attempt at flying, Scarlett decided she would recuperate; and give herself some time to relax. But for her, relaxing meant training, and pushing her already tired and weak body to its limits, because it was the only way she could ignore the pain. Pushing herself up from the soft, grassy floor below her, Scarlett let out a pained groan. Instinctively she gripped the ground, and in response, the grass made a hissing noise, and smoke rose from beneath her palm. This brought a scowl to her freckled, pale face. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just great.‚Äù She spoke with obvious disgust, annoyance, and anger.  After another round of sighing, and a few more minutes of deliberation, Scarlett finally managed to fully pick herself up from the ground; the smell of burnt grass thick in the chilly air. A frosty breeze blew her untamed locks across her face, but she didn‚Äôt care enough to adjust nor pull back her hair. She had more pressing things to worry about, like the aching soreness that engulfed her, however manageable she tried to tell herself it was. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay.‚Äù She cooed, in a calm and soothing voice that didn‚Äôt suit her; the words sounding as if they came from an entirely different person‚Äôs mouth. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay.‚Äù The words became even more dystopian as Scarlett unsheathed a hidden dagger from her left side. Her way of managing her pain was deflecting it by focusing on the one thing she did best. Fighting. Unable to control her smile, she peered down at the weapon‚Äôs reflective surface, taking joy in seeing it shine; breathing her unnaturally hot breath upon its lustrous surface to maintain its beauty. ‚ÄúHome sweet home.‚Äù The girl said aloud as she gripped the blade‚Äôs etched hilt; readying herself to throw it. However, before she could even aim it, something made her freeze dead in her tracks. Like a deer in headlights, she ceased all movements. Someone, or something, had created a noise nearby. Being too preoccupied with her injuries to notice their presence before, Scarlett couldn‚Äôt tell if this being was a friend or foe. Her bird-like wings animalistically quivered, and her golden eyes zoomed around her surroundings, trying to find the source of the sudden sound. ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù She asked aloud, although it was to no one in particular; her voice so low it was barely even a whisper. The air was so thick that it could be cut with a knife; tensions were high as she began to flex her wings, her defensive posture unwavering as she held her dagger with deadly intent. However, all her fears died away as soon as she caught sight of the person responsible for the noise. Despite herself, she let out a sigh of relief; unable to hold the noise back. Nonetheless, she maintained her composure. ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù She inquired with a tone sounding as lethal as the dagger that she held in her hand. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it common sense not to sneak up on someone?‚Äù She refused to admit it was her fault she hadn‚Äôt noticed their presence sooner. Just how much of her struggle had they seen. ‚ÄúWell. What do you want?‚Äù Despite the tense moment that had just occurred, Scarlett‚Äôs voice was sarcastic and teasing, although her defensive stance remained unwavering; her wings outstretched regardless of how weak they were.

For context we have a lot in common race, sexuality, professional goals, etc and we‚Äôve been compared a handful of times or mistaken for one another. We were relatively close in college because we had the same friend group and had overlapping schedules. However things took a turn when Tom was flirting with me. I may be reading into it too much, but y‚Äôall can decide for yourselves. 1) he slide up a few times on my gym pictures and complimented my figure 2) he drunkenly grabbed on to my thigh and nuzzled up to me (I let it happen since he threw up and was having a bad night). I just ignored these things until they stopped happening. Fast forward to one night out in which I run into Tom‚Äôs friend at the bar. I‚Äôve never talked to this person in my life, so I was taken by surprised when he grabbed me by the shoulder and said, ‚ÄúAre you Tom‚Äôs friend. Yeah you are! You don‚Äôt know me, but I know enough about you. We‚Äôre not gonna be friends, so let‚Äôs leave it at that.‚Äù I was left speechless for a moment. What did Tom say to this guy that would warrant that kind of statement? I toil with this for a while and decide to ask about it during the next hangout. A week later, the friend group meets up, and we take turns catching up on each other lives. I go last because I was chowing down on food. I only planned on speaking about two things, and since the bar incident was a little heavy/confrontational I decided to start with a lighter topic.  I tell the group about a guy I‚Äôve been talking to from tinder, and I whip my phone around to gasps from two of my friends. Tom speaks up first and says he dated him in the past, and another friend said she did as well. Tom tells us how horrible he is, and I immediately get the ick and stop talking to the tinder guy. However a week later Tom tells texts me and says he reached out to the guy after our lunch to get closure. I support him in this decision, but he then tells me they are going on dates after a few days. Fast forward a month and I‚Äôm hosting a wine. The topic of past relationships gets brought up, and I bring up the only ex I have regrets about (let‚Äôs call him Jose). Tom says, ‚Äúoh I dated Jose!‚Äù Which is news to me because we don‚Äôt have the same taste in men. I ask how did the relationship go, but he doesn‚Äôt disclose anything or tell me anything about Jose that I didn‚Äôt just state to the group. This leaves me feeling put off by Tom, so I stop talking about relationships around him. (Fast forward to our senior year 6 months later). Tom and I don‚Äôt really text or hang out outside the friend group. One day I get a message from him asking for help with reviewing grad school applications, and I happily help out. I give detailed suggestions on what to edit, and I help him practice for interviews after he receives invitations. More times flys by, and I decide to let past incidents go. I reach out to Tom a few times to get coffee or food, but I‚Äôm always met with ‚Äúfor sure let I‚Äôll let you know when I‚Äôm free.‚Äù I‚Äôm sadden by this but still try to plan one on one hangouts (my last attempt was beginning of Fall of this year.) Throughout our friendship Tom has a on and off relationship with this demonic twink that he met through our mutual friend. The first ‚Äúbreakup‚Äù was ugly, and we obviously supported him and ostracize the demon twink. This cycle repeats until he tells us that he can handle a purely sexual relationship (Tom wants to be monogamous relationship). I still feel anger towards the twink because he doesn‚Äôt learn from his mistakes and keeps hurting Tom. However Tom loves to invite the demon whenever we go out. I confront Tom about this, and ask what does he want from me when the demon is in my presence. I am told to do whatever I want, and he can handle it. Okay. (Fast forward 3 months later to Tom‚Äôs birthday this year) Half his guest list can‚Äôt make it, so I try to be more cheerful and excited to compensate. He tells me that my presence is appreciated, and that he knows he can always count on me. We hug and head to the club with a few others. Later that night he invites the twins to join us. I ignore the demon (I don‚Äôt make eye contact or acknowledge his presence whatsoever), and this gets me a mean look from Tom and a cold shoulder for the rest of the night. A few weeks later we go see a concert together, and low and behold Jose and the demon are there. I briefly tried to reconnect with Jose for the first time in years this summer, but it didn‚Äôt go anywhere. I kind of curled up into a ball after seeing him there, and my friends check in on me. Tom catcalled Jose while this was going on, but realized I was upset afterwards. He kept asking if that‚Äôs actually, and he swears he thought Jose was a stranger. Jose looks basically the same just a little skinner and with better hair now. I pull back from Tom after this. This was a month ago, and I don‚Äôt know what to do from here. It‚Äôs just complicated because we‚Äôre in the same friend group. I feel conflicted because I don‚Äôt think friendships are suppose to be so frustrating. AITAH?

1hj21sp,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1hj21sp/easy_dinner/,Easy dinner,"I decided to have cream of mushroom soup tonight.  So I got out the pots and blender and whipped up a batch.   I used this recipe https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/235589/chef-johns-creamy-mushroom-soup/   This makes a delicious rich and filling soup. This recipe can be followed easily by a beginner.    I served it with Waasa crackers cheese and some cold veggies.

It has 13 carbs 23g fat and 272 calories per serving.  Because of the heavy cream (i actually used 1/2 & 1/2 because we use it in our coffee). 

With all the fat from the cream the carbs shouldn't spike at all. So far mine is rock steady. 

 I'm not sure what I'd use to make this vegan.  The butter at the beginning is easy just use margarine.  At the end it calls for 2 cups of heavy cream.  Other than coconut cream I don't know what options vegans have.  Coconut cream would substantially alter the flavor.  I'll leave that up to the vegans.",2,1734754834.0,diabetes,0,1.0,False

Total long shot, but wondering if anyone else is headed to Pondicherry for NYE? I'm  (23M) going on a solo trip from Dec 29-Jan 3. Thought it'd be cool to see if any fellow Hyderabadis are around. 

I'll be in Chennai till the 30th, then Pondy for NYE, and quick stop at Auroville before heading back. First time there, so pretty much winging it.

If anyone's planning to be in these places around the same time and wants to grab a coffee or hang out and bitch about how the biryani there is not as good as ours, that'd be awesome! If not, totally cool - any tips about the places are super welcome too.

1hj1zd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1hj1zd6/severe_digestive_issues_after_eatinglooking_for/,Severe Digestive Issues After Eating‚ÄîLooking for Advice or Shared Experiences,"Hi Reddit,

I‚Äôm a 25-year-old male with GERD, and I‚Äôve been dealing with digestive issues for¬†*years*. I feel like I‚Äôve tried everything, seen every specialist, and still feel awful‚Äîespecially after eating. Here‚Äôs my story (I‚Äôll keep it as short as I can while covering the key details).

**The Backstory**

* Started around 2019 with left-sided chest pain. EKG normal, so I moved on.
* 2020: GI referral led to an EGD. Findings: mild distal esophagitis, superficial erosions in my distal esophagus, and an erythematous gastric fold. Biopsies were normal, no H. pylori. Nexium didn‚Äôt help much long-term.
* 2022: Bulked up with 2.5‚Äì3K calories/day, gained 20 lbs. Felt constant abdominal fullness, but pushed through while in college.

**The Downhill Slide**

* 2023: Chest tightness (and tachycardia) sent me to the ER twice. Everything was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù (EKG, X-ray, bloodwork). Diagnosed with anxiety, tried SSRIs‚Äîno improvement.
* Multiple tests (H. pylori, celiac, fecal fat, pancreatic elastase, HIDA scan, CT abdomen) were all normal. Gallbladder showed no stones but was ‚Äúpartially contracted.‚Äù

**Current Symptoms**

* Every time I eat‚Äîeven small, healthy meals‚ÄîI feel awful:
   * **Abdominal tightness/fullness**
   * **Chest tightness**¬†(probably upper abdominal pressure)
   * **Fatigue**¬†(even with 7‚Äì9 hrs sleep)
   * **Tachycardia**¬†(especially after larger meals)
   * Pain under ribs (left > right) that‚Äôs dull but persistent. (ranging from \~3-7/10)
* Symptoms subside when my stomach is empty, but I still feel weak overall.
* I‚Äôve lost 40 lbs (from 180 lbs at my peak to 140 lbs), but my weight has stabilized at 160 lbs recently. Appetite still sucks, and I‚Äôve tried¬†*everything*‚ÄîPPIs, supplements, diets. Nothing works.

**Tests I‚Äôve Done**

* 2 EGDs: Mild esophagitis, but nothing major. Biopsies negative.
* Gallbladder: Normal HIDA scan (>65% EF).
* CT abdomen: Unremarkable.
* Breath hydrogen test: Negative.
* Cardiology: EKG, stress test, and 2D echo all normal.
* Labs: Normal amylase, lipase, pancreatic elastase, and celiac panel.

**What I Eat**¬†I eat mostly home-cooked meals (olive oil, lean proteins, veggies), but even plain chicken and rice makes me feel terrible. Sometimes, just drinking coffee triggers symptoms (I‚Äôm down to one cup/day).

**Why I‚Äôm Posting**¬†I‚Äôm desperate. I feel crippled every single day because of how I feel after eating. Unless I eat¬†*tiny portions*, I‚Äôm miserable‚Äîtightness, tachycardia, and that horrible full feeling. It‚Äôs draining me physically and mentally.

If anyone has dealt with similar symptoms or can point me toward a specialist, condition, or test I might have missed, I‚Äôd be beyond grateful.",5,1734754578.0,ibs,4,1.0,False

Nov 3 smashing pumpkins. And kicking laptop.
Said he would replace the pumpkin which was $20 but no mention of the laptop 

Nov 4 
Didn‚Äôt follow through with ordering pumpkin. It‚Äôs too little too late. 

5:36 pm
Pumpkin arrived today. Broken and half the size of the other. Makes me think I am selling myself short for this guy‚Äôs ‚Äúpumpkin‚Äù when the one I got on my own was so much better. Learn to stand on my own two feet. I can do anything with God‚Äôs help! 

Pumpkin arrived but it‚Äôs broken. Way smaller and won‚Äôt stay lit. ‚Äú

I ended up leaving him and only lasted nine days. Unbelievably I let him back in and here I am now two years older and just now waking up. Don‚Äôt settle for some man‚Äôs pathetic, broken heart. It‚Äôs not our job to heal it.

1hj1xsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1hj1xsj/what_accessories_do_i_need/,What accessories do I need?,"Virtually every Aeropress recipe video I watch on YouTube uses coffee scales. From what I understand these are specialty scales with both a timer and an accuracy of .1g. The digital kitchen scales I have only shows the whole gram. 

So far I‚Äôve not even used my standard Slater scales, just taking an Aeropress scoop of beans to grind and using the numbers on the side of the Aeropress to gauge how much water I pour. Perhaps another heresy is that I only use a normal kettle (a hob top, not an electric). No swan necks or temperature controlled super-kettles in sight. So, my question, do I need a new kettle and coffee scales? Or, more precisely, will I get ‚Äòbetter‚Äô coffee with those additions? 

My cup of coffee without weighing beans and water does seem fine to my naive palate but the one thing I have decided to get is a decent canister to keep my beans as fresh as possible. ",2,1734754422.0,AeroPress,9,1.0,False
