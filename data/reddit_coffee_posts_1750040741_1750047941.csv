Not coincidentally, she is the roommate I have lived with longer than anyone else. She is exactly that roommate who will complain and berate us if we leave our dirty dishes in the sink or whatever but then when she leaves her dirty dishes in the sink it's only ever because she's had a long day and doesn't have the mental energy to wash dishes at the moment. Not that stops her from complaining if we do the same.

She is also very passive aggressive, territorial, and petty. She has a hundred rules she expects everyone to follow and throws a fit anytime someone forgets one, refusing to believe it could be an accident and insisting we are disrespecting her boundaries. She has a bunch of kitchen tools, bowls, a special cover for the microwave and other such things and if anything is not where she wants it to be put away she throws a fit. There are special rules for the bathroom as well, which I am not as familiar with since I don't share a bathroom with her but will mention since one occasion she lost her mind in the group chat because someone had left water around the faucet. 

We have all tried to explain to her that with so many people sharing the same space, and all of us living busy lives, it isn't reasonable to think we can follow all of her rules all the time but she refuses to listen. She says that because she remembers which coffee mug is my favorite and has never used that, it is the same thing.

For the longest time I was the one who defended her to the others, trying to be understanding and patient. Then last winter I found my car was frozen in a layer of thick ice formed as melting slush had frozen over. I was running in and out of the kitchen, where this roommate was cooking, desperately trying different things to melt the ice. I told her what was happening as I waited for a kettle of water to boil, and she didn't really care since she doesn't have a car to worry about chipping out. I ran in and out of that kitchen a few times, frantically looking for a solution and only getting more desperate as the situation wore on. Once I accepted hot water was only making the situation worse I realized I had no choice but to resort to salt and an ice scraper. As I reached over her shoulder to grab the salt, she snapped at me for stepping in her personal bubble. Stunned, I reminded her about my frozen car but she just sneered ""You're just more important than everyone else in the whole world aren't you?"" I had had enough. I pushed past her, grabbed the salt, and stormed off to spend the next half hour chiseling out my car with numb fingers in 4 degrees. 

The next day she name a very loud point of stepping into my space at every opportunity, at one point almost hitting me in the head with a cubpoard door. She also quietly refused to pay her portion of the utility bill, which is in my name and everyone reimburses me for every month. Every time I mentioned it to her she would pretend she just forgot and then not send the money, making me chase after her. When I confronted her in front of the others, she lied to my face that she had already sent the money and it just hadn't arrived. She did eventually pay up but I told her she owed me an apology for the way she's been acting and she refused, slamming the door in my face. 

I want revenge, but I don't want to get the other three roommates caught in the crossfire. She works from home (as does another roommate) rarely leaves her room, does not allow anyone inside, saying we will contaminate it, and, as I have said, is extremely territorial over her items in the house. What can I do that will only affect her?",1,1750047370.0,roommateproblems,0,1.0,False
1lcjioc,https://i.redd.it/uq98s2c7s77f1.jpeg,"FANFIC OF THE SUB, FACES OF FATE: Cycle Two, A Piece Of A Revelation","#""CHAPTER SOMETHING"": MANSION SANCTUS


The past time that once grew around us, abandoning us when we rise and ascend it, aging towards death, is mostly forgotten. One cannot recall what coffee they had, nor the smell of the air. For Sieben, however, it was a complete loss of memory, and thus, the loss of his grasp on the past, present, and possible future. 

The mansion was, in truth, as Pick_Me_Gal had said, a sanctum for his most important memories. Sieben had had the insight to place objects of possible importance to him, ones which could arouse the forgotten from the abyss, such as the diluded yellow cups, the old grandfather clock raised on a small pedestal, and the dusty windows: which, once cleaned, revealed subtle designs that the uncaring eye would never see. It was futile, mostly, but when it worked, it was to resounding success. 

It had now been three days since Sieben locked himself within his room. 

For those three days, Darthren had gone searching in the house, always making sure to hide away from Pick_Me_Gal's watchful eye. He, the youth, knew he was missing many, many details. 

Sieben never denied having a steward, but never admitted to it either. He never paid Pick_Me_Gal, allowing only small dividends of fanciful diamonds (for the lady, as he said).

Who exactly was Pick_Me_Gal? Why was he so knowledgeable of the Noble? What would happen if the mansion were to be destroyed? 

And, the most vexing question, who was this Useful_Ad? 

*Useful_Ad, awaiting judgement, with eyes dim like my own* Darthren thought, as he snuck through a winding hidden corridor behind the fireplace. He stepped over long forgotten ashes that seeped through the wall. The air, damp, molded, and dusty, felt suffocating and was indeed a real sensation of slow death by smoke. 

Darthren wished to find a way to relieve the Noble of his self-imposed exile. But, firstly, he had a curiousity and questions to answer. 

He made his way within the hidden corridor, emerging in the secondary living room, and finally quickly paced down the stairs towards the secondary level, descending down from the third floor rather silently and quickly. 

Once done, he checked both sides of each hallway to ensure Pick_Me_Gal was not present. 

Then, once done, Darthren continued to move, checking room after room for any hidden details that was obscured.

He found nothing.

Not to be wavered by this lack of success, he continued, finally urging himself to step inside of the ""steward's"" room. 

The room itself was rather large, larger than Darthren's own small hut outside. Furnished finely, with gilded tails that fell towards the floor, and even expanded upon it like lightning, it was coupled by rising cupboards stacked full of unnecessary items. Upon the left, which stood only two paces away from the door, the bed was placed, and to the right, a desk, without any ink or paper, firmly laid out against a dull wall, stared out like a blackeye. Infront of the door, to it's side, was a random pot. 

Darthren gulped, before stepping into the room, forgetting to close the door behind him.

First he searched the cupboards, finding only nonsensical things.

Then the bed. Nothing. 

The desk had no shelves, no paper...Darthren almost refused to search it had he not spied a small shimmer of yellow-ish white, tucked behind the desk and poking just from the wall. He reached forward and took it swiftly.

He opened it carefully.

It read, in Pick_Me_Gal's writing...

*""His condition worsens. Why do I bother to stay befriended to this madman is beyond even my own comprehension. Losing himself to madness is pitiful, but forgetting he is mad and attempting to save himself makes it worse. At first, he would visit me on specific days in summer, making sure to bring tea with him, taking me to a Gazebo on the meadow. Now, he only comes erratically, saying odd things such as 'hello' then abandoning my presence. He has done this thirty times, yet he insists it is the first time he has ever done it every time.""*

*""Never before or since have I ever seen a man become so empty, whilst claiming he is not. It is like he denies his own being out of fear to admit what he is. But can he even feel fear? He is apathetic, yet one capable of emotions. A contradicting image made manifest in reality.*""

*""I can sense his heavy sense of duty, the very burden of existing, and his unanswerable question: Why am I here? If I were him, I would have gone out already. Vanished.""*

*""He asks me impossible questions, fully knowing I cannot answer them. But, even if I could, it would not be the answer he is looking for. Or would it? What would exactly satisfy this Noble's desire for answers? For an unreachable truth?""*

*""If he was Fate, or Destiny, he would surely know!""*

*""I want to pity him, and in partly doing and trying have I become his temporary steward. His mansion is unearthly, and I find it difficult to navigate it. Hundreds of useless items, sprawled about in rooms no longer used.""""

*""He seems to have forgotten my name, unless he connects it with me being his 'steward' and not his friend. He has forgotten my character, my being in nature to be more precise.*""

here the ink became a scrawl, yet Darthren could still read it.

*""I have neither the strength to deny this convoluted, mad existence a moment of respite from his insanity, nor do I have the ability to give him anything but that.""*

*""It troubles me, as he has become plagued by Capricorns. Even now, he hates them, obsesses over them, talking to them. It is foolishness.""*

*""Anyway. I digress. There has been a recent addition to his mansion: a boy! A nobody, it seems, with his head adorned with capricorn horns. Sieben had them cut off in his madness and obsessive rage over Capricorns. He does not remember ordering this, of course. His lack of memories allows him to forget all things: a blessing and a curse.""*

*""But the youth did not cry, nor flinch. He simply became dazed as his horns were removed. He forgot, like the person who rules this manor. He has a new name, a new identity. What was it? Darthren. Yes. That is his new name.""*

*""Here I log more details. The youth was previously named...I forget. How ironic.""*

Dartheen could scarcely believe what he was reading. He had had horns? Just who was he? His original name...nevermind. The steward of the mansion wasn't exactly a real steward at all? Sieben had been afflicted with this amnesia for this long? 

Darthren attempted to read more of the parchment, yet he could hear the sounds of footsteps. Thus, he abandoned it (or, more precisely, tucked it underneath his shirt) and fled Pick_Me_Gal's room with great haste. 

However, as he stepped out of the room, he almost knocked over the random pot placed aside the door, causing his feet to trip. As he fell, he caught himself swiftly by planting both hands on the floor and spinning round to avoid slamming face first into the ground. 

But, in doing so alerted the ""steward"", who, hearing the strange commotion that would rouse any suspicion, stepped towards his room. 

Darthren scrambled, at first on all fours, then on his legs, as he leapt inside of an abandoned room, knocking over random objects and knick knacks. 

He could still not think clearly, as the letter felt, and was, a destroying power that, in ruinous fashion, warped the youth's sense of everything. He did not even trust that he had read anything correctly, but nevertheless, the letter, or the parchment, tucked beneath his shirt, was telling of it's existence.

Enjoy!

When I met you, I felt like I had reached a new level in life. You were different than anyone I had ever met. How could someone be so creative, free, sweet, funny, interesting, selfless, communicative. You encouraged me to do things I would've never done alone. Suddenly, I was jumping fences and immersed in nature during the most stressful period of my life. I was in a fearful place when you met me, unable to move out of the place I was in. Stuck, unsure of what was next for me, unable to make decisions. Seeing the way you fearlessly followed what you wanted and did whatever it took to get there changed me. I had to keep reminding myself through that time¬†that I am grateful to be here with you, but that I can't get attached to you. You can't be tied down, you're not in the right place. I never expected it would've turned into what it did. I noticed the ways that you showed you cared, but I was confused because I could feel you pulling back simultaneously. When you told me you loved me, I was shocked and not expecting it at all. I'll never forget that day. We went to Academy to go shopping for fun, and decided to buy tennis rackets and play tennis that night. We drove around for hours at midnight trying to find tennis courts. When we found one, there were no lights on, so we goofily hit the ball back and forth, missing it every time in the dark. We both walked up to the net. The moon was so full and bright. We held hands and held eye contact, and you said, ""I love you."" I responded, ""I know it might not seem genuine since you just said it to me, but I love you too."" While my feelings were honest, I felt an uncertainty in my heart. Without commitment and with confusion, how could this be love? I'd never been with someone that made me cry so much without ever trying, and despite the pain, I couldn't stop coming around. He was in his own world, running away from his feelings, going hours on end forgetting to check up on me. I took it as a time to work on my anxiety, but I couldn't help but feel unsafe. Once we finally started getting close enough for me to let me walls down, which took a long time, the fear of rejection went away and all of my needs I'd been rejecting to keep you around surfaced. Why are you not taking me out any more? Why were you speaking to your ex this entire time? Why do you make every conflict my fault? Why do you make me prove myself, and then when I fail your tests, say we're incompatible? Say I'm not the sweet girl you thought I was when I protect my energy?¬†That can't be love, I thought to myself. At some point, I gave up my boundaries and decided to just give in to your every need. I felt invisible, but at least I knew I wouldn't lose you. I drove an hour away to bring my dog to my parents' so I can stay at your house since you never wanted to come to mine. I cleaned your room and house after I told you I wouldn't since I'm not your girlfriend. I carried dozens of plants to and from your car when you needed. I stood in your garden in the heat every day to listen to you talk about plants I knew nothing about. You did tell me all of your exes didn't want to wait in your garden for you, so I knew I didn't get to say I'm hot out here or I have somewhere to be. At some point, we reached a level of humor that really connected us. Our wit flowed so easily together. A lot of your jokes, though, hurt me. You joked about your lust for other women, that I would never do¬†better than you, that I had daddy issues which made me ""desperate for your love."" You accused me of receiving too many things from you, that food was too expensive and that it's gonna become a problem soon. I felt helpless because I was buying so much for you, not to mention the imbalance in almost every other part of our relationship. I was giving everything I had with little in return and being told I'm not doing enough. I found myself many times among the mess of your room, rolling you a joint, thinking I have come way too far to be in a spot like this. I deserve better and he doesn't think I do. When you told me that you were going to see your ex, I knew it was finally time. I can't let you continuously choose every thing else but me. I screamed and cried in my house alone. ""Fuck both of y'all,"" I said over in over. I got in my car and brought myself to get coffee and go shopping. At least I never lost the ability to take care of myself. You called me several times that day, either blaming me, apologizing, or brushing it off and pretending everything's fine. In between these calls, I go to your house and collect my things. We talk that night, I say I need to break up for at least a couple weeks because my brain is beat and I can't even think. Once alone, I got to thinking about everything and it all caught up to me. Why have I been ignoring myself? That loud voice in my head telling me i'm in pain? I'm lonely? I'm invisible? I started to really hate you for a couple days. You hurt me so consistently, and always had a way to explain yourself out of it. Maybe you are not selfless. Maybe you are not communicative. You did communicate to me several times that I wasn't wanted, so I guess there's that. And, over those few days, you confessed to me that you also did some thinking. You realized how big of a mistake you made. You realized how good I treated you and how selfish you have been. You must've known that before now. Was this your master plan? Drag me along just long enough to where you can see your ex one more time, and then apologize your way out of it? Sometimes it feels like it, but I don't wanna admit it. I don't wanna admit you treated me this way. I feel bad for you, you must be in a tough place to be smoking this much and putting me down so often. Even after all of the pain, I think about you. I worry about you. I miss you so much. I want so badly to start over. For my friends not to hate you. For none of this to have happened. But it did, and here we are. Here I am alone in my room, grieving another heartbreak. This one might be the hardest of them all.¬†",1,1750046737.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1lcjg11,https://i.redd.it/yx42svm1r77f1.jpeg,Starbucks in China cut prices‚Äîonly to find no one cared.,"Since entering the Chinese market more than 20 years ago, Starbucks has maintained a high-end image, with consistently high product prices. However, under the pressure of a price war and the impact of domestic brands, Starbucks has finally chosen to bow its head. On June 10, Starbucks launched its largest-ever price reduction, and related topics quickly trended on social media. But consumers weren't buying it, leaving comments such as: ‚ÄúOver 20 yuan for a cup is still too expensive.‚Äù

**1. Over 20 Yuan a Cup Is Still Too Expensive**

Starbucks has finally cut prices. Starting from June 10, Starbucks China reduced prices on dozens of non-coffee beverages, with an average cut of 5 yuan. The price drop includes three flagship product categories: Frappuccino, iced shaken teas, and tea lattes. Now, consumers can get a drink for as low as 23 yuan.

This marks the first large-scale price adjustment by Starbucks in its over 20 years in China. As soon as the news broke, the topic of Starbucks' price cuts trended on social media.

It seemed that Starbucks had finally decided to lower prices and share the profits with consumers‚Äîbut the reaction was lukewarm. Many people commented: ‚ÄúOnly 5 yuan off? That‚Äôs meaningless,‚Äù ‚Äú23 yuan is still enough to buy three cups at Luckin or four at Mixue Bingcheng,‚Äù and ‚ÄúEven with a 5 yuan cut, I won‚Äôt buy. Let me know when it‚Äôs down to 5 yuan.‚Äù

Starbucks' price reduction turned out to be a dud. Around 2 p.m. on the same day, *Caijing Tianxia* visited a Starbucks store at Beijing‚Äôs China World Trade Center and found that the sales volume of the discounted non-coffee drinks had not changed significantly. A loyal Starbucks customer in the store admitted that the price cut had no impact on him‚Äîhis favorite coffee beverages weren‚Äôt part of the discount.

  
In fact, many consumers have long perceived that Starbucks has already been reducing its prices to around 20 yuan through indirect methods such as coupons, combo discounts, and group-buying deals. Although this latest price cut by Starbucks is more straightforward, in offline stores the cheapest option still costs 23 yuan per cup ‚Äî prompting many consumers to bluntly state: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still too expensive.‚Äù

According to Wang Hongdong, founder of *Canbaodian* (a food and beverage industry analysis platform), Starbucks‚Äô latest price cut may struggle to deliver the desired results. Compared to competitors like Luckin Coffee, CHAGEE, and Mixue Bingcheng, Starbucks does not offer a significant price advantage. Furthermore, its non-coffee beverages are not particularly competitive ‚Äî there are simply too many substitute products on the market.

Consumers indeed have a wide array of choices. For Fang Xiao, a post-90s consumer in Beijing, she prefers new tea brands that offer fresh ingredients and youthful marketing, such as CHAGEE. More often, she opts for non-coffee drinks that emphasize value for money, like Luckin‚Äôs Light Milk Tea with Jasmine, fruit and vegetable teas priced at 9.9 yuan, or Cotti Coffee‚Äôs fruit teas for as low as 8.8 yuan.

  
Recently, thanks to the subsidy battles on food delivery platforms, many consumers have effectively achieved ‚Äúcoffee and milk tea freedom‚Äù‚Äîbeing able to enjoy a cup from Cotti, ChaBaiDao, CHAGEE, and others for just a few yuan. Faced with this situation, why has Starbucks chosen to lower prices? In response, Starbucks stated that it‚Äôs part of their ‚Äúcoffee in the morning, non-coffee in the afternoon‚Äù strategy. In other words, Starbucks wants to compete with its direct rivals for the same group of consumers during the afternoon tea period.

‚ÄúThe real reason behind the price cut is that Starbucks is facing considerable pressure in China‚Äîit's a move driven by the situation,‚Äù said Wang Hongdong in an interview with *Caijing Tianxia*.

Indeed, Starbucks has always positioned itself in China as offering ‚Äúhigh quality and high value.‚Äù For over 20 years, in order to maintain its premium image, Starbucks has kept its head held high. But in recent years, due to the price war and the rise of domestic brands, things have gotten increasingly difficult for Starbucks China.

‚ÄúIf Starbucks were to cut prices on its core coffee products, it could damage the brand‚Äôs image. To play it safe, they‚Äôre testing price reductions on non-coffee items, which also has less impact on profits,‚Äù Wang explained.

When asked whether the price reduction for non-coffee products would be ongoing or limited to this summer, Starbucks responded: ‚ÄúIn the future, we‚Äôll decide on follow-up promotional plans based on customer feedback.‚Äù Regarding whether the discount strategy might eventually extend to coffee products, Starbucks replied: ‚ÄúOur pricing is determined after comprehensive evaluation of multiple factors.‚Äù

# 2. The Deadly Temptation of Lower-Tier Markets

Even if Starbucks genuinely wants to compete for the same afternoon-tea consumers as its rivals, it is still targeting a group of price-sensitive users. But who are these price-sensitive consumers? ‚ÄúYoung people from lower-tier cities,‚Äù Wang Hongdong told *Caijing Tianxia*.

So-called ‚Äúlower-tier markets‚Äù refer to cities ranked third-tier and below, as well as county towns and rural areas‚Äîregions characterized by large populations and high consumption potential. According to veteran industry insider Song Feng, lower-tier markets are not ‚Äúlow-end markets,‚Äù but rather a ‚Äúblue ocean‚Äù where consumption segmentation and upgrading coexist. These markets cover nearly 1 billion people in China, yet the penetration of freshly made beverages is only about one-tenth that of higher-tier cities‚Äîleaving massive room for growth.

In recent years, these markets have brought significant incremental gains and strategic opportunities to brands like HeyTea, CHAGEE, Mixue Bingcheng, and Luckin. As of December 31, 2024, 57.4% of Mixue Bingcheng‚Äôs stores were located in third-tier and lower cities, with a total retail sales volume of 58.3 billion yuan in 2024.

CHAGEE‚Äôs stores in lower-tier cities often exceed 150 square meters to enhance their role as social spaces. During the Spring Festival return-to-hometown season in 2025, CHAGEE‚Äôs stores in third- and fourth-tier cities saw a 300% increase in sales compared to the previous period, with some tourist area locations selling over 3,000 cups per day‚Äîamong the top in the country.

While Starbucks initiated its lower-tier market strategy in China as early as 2010, its expansion was slow. It wasn‚Äôt until 2022 that Starbucks began accelerating its push into lower-tier cities. As of March 30, 2025, Starbucks had a presence in 1,000 county-level administrative districts‚Äîabout 35% of all counties in China.

‚ÄúStarbucks still holds appeal as a symbol of the middle class in China‚Äôs lower-tier markets‚Äîespecially for those seeking social identity,‚Äù explained Song Feng. Consumers in these regions place more importance on offline experiences, and Starbucks‚Äô in-store environment satisfies the need for familiar, community-based social interaction.

  
From a consumption habit perspective, consumers in lower-tier markets tend to prefer sweet beverages, and their demand is higher during non-coffee hours in the afternoon and evening. According to *Caijing Tianxia*‚Äôs analysis, Starbucks‚Äô main consumer groups in China‚Äôs lower-tier markets fall into several categories:

* **Returnee youth or college students** who have lived in first- or second-tier cities and seek a quality lifestyle and identity recognition;
* **Local middle-class consumers** with monthly incomes of 6,000‚Äì8,000 yuan, who face no mortgage pressure and have spending power comparable to white-collar workers in top-tier cities;
* **Young people driven by social needs**, such as young professionals or those who enjoy visiting popular check-in spots.

In addition, **high-net-worth individuals**‚Äîsuch as private business owners and other high-income groups in county areas‚Äîalso make up a significant portion of Starbucks‚Äô consumer base. They are more accepting of a unit price over 20 yuan and value Starbucks‚Äô brand image.

‚ÄúBy lowering prices to tap into the non-coffee consumption scenarios of lower-tier markets and to enhance foot traffic stability at stores in those areas, Starbucks is pursuing another important goal with this price adjustment,‚Äù explained Song Feng.

  
Choosing to lower prices specifically for Starbucks China‚Äôs three signature non-coffee product lines‚ÄîFrappuccino, Iced Shaken Tea, and Tea Latte‚Äîwas also part of a calculated strategy. Back in 2022, then-COO of Starbucks China, Liu Wenjuan, had stated that lower-tier markets showed stronger acceptance for Iced Shaken Tea and Frappuccino. The logic behind the current price cuts builds on that earlier insight.

Objectively speaking, with rising incomes, strategic brand moves like price adjustments, and innovations in product scenarios, Starbucks does have potential to expand its customer base in lower-tier markets. However, as Wang Hongdong put it, ‚Äúhow large that potential is remains difficult to assess.‚Äù

After all, Starbucks‚Äô core customer base in China‚Äôs lower-tier cities remains limited. An employee at the Starbucks in Wenshan, Yunnan, noted that their customers are mainly ‚Äúwhite-collar workers and students who are less sensitive to price,‚Äù and that repeat purchases often depend on social scenarios. Similarly, a staff member at a Starbucks in a Hebei county reported that after the initial rush when the store opened (peaking at about 100 orders per day), daily traffic halved to around 50 orders following the National Day holiday.

In these lower-tier markets, the mainstream price range for non-coffee beverages‚Äîdominated by brands like Mixue Bingcheng and Gu Ming‚Äîtypically falls between 10‚Äì20 yuan. While some consumers can accept prices between 20‚Äì25 yuan, this group is relatively small. Although Starbucks has now reduced some Frappuccino products to just above 20 yuan, this still exceeds the mainstream price range.

Moreover, Starbucks must compete directly with brands like Mixue Bingcheng for these price-sensitive consumers. The reality is that Starbucks trails behind Luckin and Mixue Bingcheng in both store count and geographic coverage in China. It‚Äôs clear that this large-scale price cut reflects the difficult position Starbucks China finds itself in.

# 3. Selling and Discounting Aren‚Äôt Mutually Exclusive

‚ÄúPremium positioning is hard to push downmarket, price wars are difficult to join, and innovation speed is lagging.‚Äù This, according to Song Feng in *Caijing Tianxia*, summarizes the three major challenges currently facing Starbucks China. As a result, Starbucks China's same-store sales have seen consecutive declines throughout fiscal 2024. Revenue dropped 1.4% year-on-year to 21.06 billion yuan, while Luckin Coffee surpassed it with 34.475 billion yuan.

In an effort to reverse its decline, Starbucks China has launched a series of self-rescue strategies, including price cuts, category expansion, organizational restructuring, and deeper localization.

For example, in December 2024, Starbucks China introduced a **Chief Growth Officer (CGO)** position for the first time, appointing **Yang Zhen** to lead growth strategy, product innovation, and digital marketing. In September 2024, **Liu Wenjuan** was promoted from Co-CEO to CEO of Starbucks China, while **Belinda Wong** remained as chairperson. By January 2025, Wong retired, and Liu Wenjuan took over both roles, spearheading digitalization and expansion into lower-tier markets.

As part of the June 2025 price cut campaign and in an effort to appeal to younger consumers, Starbucks China also announced a new product collaboration: on June 17, it will launch three new **Zootopia-themed** Iced Shaken Teas in partnership with Disney.

However, the most dramatic ‚Äúself-rescue‚Äù move might be this: putting itself on the market.

In **November 2024**, news emerged that Starbucks was considering bringing in a strategic partner for its China business, possibly through selling a stake. A global spokesperson for Starbucks responded by saying that ‚Äúexploring strategic partnerships‚Äù was one potential path for growth but did not confirm specific plans.

In **February 2025**, Starbucks Global CEO **Laxman Narasimhan** reiterated during an earnings call that the company is ‚Äúcontinuing to explore partnerships,‚Äù clearly referencing its China business. He highlighted China‚Äôs unique challenges‚Äîincluding price wars and high costs of lower-tier market expansion‚Äîand emphasized the need to ‚Äúimprove efficiency through localized partnerships.‚Äù Around the same time, multiple potential buyers for Starbucks China were reportedly being considered.

  
Private equity firms such as **KKR**, **FountainVest Partners**, and **PAG (Pacific Alliance Group)**, along with Chinese enterprises like **China Resources Group** and **Meituan**, have reportedly been involved in preliminary negotiations regarding Starbucks China. In response, Starbucks China has issued multiple official statements emphasizing that it is ‚Äúexploring potential strategic partnerships,‚Äù without denying ongoing discussions with entities such as KKR and China Resources.

According to analyst **Song Feng**, there are several key drivers behind the possible sale of Starbucks China:

1. **Local competition and pricing pressure**: Domestic brands with aggressive low-price strategies have significantly compressed Starbucks‚Äô growth space. To survive and thrive, Starbucks China needs the support of local capital to **optimize its supply chain** and **deepen penetration into lower-tier markets**.
2. **Operational cost relief**: A local partner could help alleviate Starbucks‚Äô **operational burdens**‚Äîfor example, by assisting in reducing **rent**, **labor costs**, and other fixed expenses, which are particularly critical in the highly competitive Chinese market.
3. **Part of a broader global realignment**: The pullback from China also aligns with Starbucks‚Äô global strategy. As Song Feng explains:‚ÄúStarbucks Global plans to shrink its non-core operations. While China isn‚Äôt the smallest market by global share, its performance has recently been relatively weak and continues to decline.‚Äù

Thus, the idea of selling a stake in Starbucks China is not just a reaction to short-term pressure‚Äîit reflects both the **need to localize in order to compete** and **a strategic pivot at the global level**.

Some analysts believe that **KKR** and **China Resources (ÂçéÊ∂¶)** are the most likely final bidders for Starbucks China. If **capital efficiency and aggressive localization** are Starbucks‚Äô top priorities, **KKR** may have the upper hand. KKR is known for enhancing enterprise value through **debt restructuring and equity incentives**, and it also has **strong capabilities in localizing resources**. Notably, KKR previously led the **spin-off and IPO of Yum China**, helping it restructure costs and boost its market value.

KKR‚Äôs investment strategy focuses heavily on **cash flow management**‚Äîfor example, improving profitability through **cost reduction and supply chain optimization**.

However, if **channel access and regulatory stability** are more important, then **China Resources** could be the stronger candidate. With assets such as **CR Vanguard supermarkets** and **MixC shopping malls**, China Resources can provide Starbucks with **high-quality retail locations**, especially critical in lower-tier cities.

In these markets, China Resources' **distribution network** could significantly lower **rent and expansion costs**, accelerating Starbucks China‚Äôs **penetration into the ‚Äúsinking‚Äù (lower-tier) market**. Moreover, its experience in **consumer goods logistics**‚Äîlike the extensive county-level distribution network of **China Resources Snow Beer**‚Äîcould help Starbucks **streamline procurement and logistics**.

Yet despite Starbucks China‚Äôs intense self-rescue efforts, some users on social media have begun to wonder: **Has the company abandoned its sale plans?** Analyst **Song Feng** offers a different interpretation:

>

After all, **potential buyers care most about fundamentals**. If Starbucks China can show improved performance before a deal is finalized, it could command a **higher valuation**.

>

In his view, every business narrative has two sides: some see Starbucks as struggling, while others see **its untapped potential**. When Starbucks flips its iced shaken tea price tag to **23 yuan**, it‚Äôs no longer just a defensive move in a price war‚Äîit‚Äôs a **high-stakes bet** in a broader **game of capital strategy**.

1lcjbar,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1lcjbar/the_voice_in_the_woods/,The voice in the woods,"We live tucked deep in the Southern Appalachian mountains, in a holler no GPS will find and no outsider wants to stumble into after dark. The kind of place where the woods don‚Äôt end‚Äîthey swallow. There‚Äôs a hush to the land out here. The kind of quiet that doesn‚Äôt feel empty, just watchful.

It was just past midnight when it happened. A Thursday, I think. The air was still, heavy with the scent of moss and pine, the kind of thick silence that settles over everything once the cicadas burn out. The kids were asleep. My wife had gone to bed an hour earlier, and I stayed behind in the kitchen, sipping bad coffee and scrolling through nothing.

Then I heard her call my name‚Äîsharp, afraid.

I moved fast. That‚Äôs not how she calls unless something‚Äôs wrong. I bolted down the hall toward our bedroom‚Äîonly to find it empty. The covers pulled back, the lamp still on. My stomach dropped.

Out the window, I spotted her‚Äîsitting in our old Jeep, parked just beyond the porch light‚Äôs reach. The moon was bright enough to cast everything in silver, and I could see her clearly, wide-eyed, staring out across the yard toward the woods.

That‚Äôs when John ran.

He came tearing down the gravel drive barefoot, shirtless, wild-eyed. He didn‚Äôt even look at me. Just hit the treeline and vanished into the dark like something was chasing him, or like he was running straight into hell to avoid it.

Then I heard it.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

A child‚Äôs voice. Small. Lost. A little girl‚Äîno older than six. It floated out from the black edge of the woods, just beyond the first row of trees.

There was something about it‚Äîthe way it held my name without saying it. The way it cracked just a little at the end, like she was trying not to cry.

I called back, ‚ÄúHey! Who‚Äôs out there?‚Äù

The voice answered, same tone. Same softness.
‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt just an answer. It was an echo‚Äîbut not mine. It didn‚Äôt sound like something trying to be a kid. It sounded like something pretending. And doing it too well.

My wife hadn‚Äôt moved. Still frozen in the car, but now she was staring at me. I saw it in her face‚Äîthe shift. From fear to real fear. Whatever was in those woods, she felt it too.

I motioned her toward the house, and she moved fast. She left the car door open as she sprinted. The moment she passed me, I turned to follow.

That‚Äôs when it called again.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

Closer now. Same voice. Too close.

Every inch of my body tightened. My skin knew before my brain did: this wasn‚Äôt some lost child. This was a trap. Something trying to get close enough for something worse.

I broke into a sprint. Feet hitting the porch hard, the wood creaking under me. I slammed the front door shut and threw the deadbolt. My wife collapsed against the hallway wall, breathing fast. I didn‚Äôt ask questions‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt need to.

We both knew.

Silence. Then‚Äî

Scratch.
Low. Deliberate. A slow drag of nails‚Äînot fingertips‚Äîacross the wood just beneath the handle.

Then the voice again. Just on the other side.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

The scratching stopped.

No footsteps. No rustling. Just that brutal silence the mountains keep like a secret. You could‚Äôve heard a mouse shift in the walls‚Äîor your own heartbeat cracking in your ears.

We stood still. My wife slid down the wall and curled her knees to her chest. I placed one hand on the doorframe like I was holding it closed with more than just the lock. Truth was, I didn‚Äôt trust the bolt. Not with that voice out there.

Out here in the deep woods, you learn to respect what doesn‚Äôt make sense.

I checked the time. 1:03 a.m. That meant we had hours before dawn. Hours of shadow. Of not knowing. Of that thing waiting out there. Or worse‚Äîcircling.

‚ÄúShould we call someone?‚Äù she whispered.

Call who? The county sheriff lives forty minutes away. Cell signal‚Äôs a rumor this deep in the holler. Even if we got a bar, what do I say?
‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs scratching my door and pretending to be a lost little girl‚Äù?

She knew the answer already. She didn‚Äôt ask again.

I walked to the back window and peered through the blinds. The treeline lay still. The moon lit up the yard like frost, but past the first dozen trees, it was all ink. That kind of dark where your eyes never adjust. Like the woods weren‚Äôt empty‚Äîjust full of something that knew how to hold still.

And that voice‚Ä¶

It wasn‚Äôt gone. Not really. I could feel it, just past the light. Like someone watching you from a place they‚Äôve already memorized.

That‚Äôs the thing about these mountains: they know how to listen. They soak up sound. They let your screams die in the hollows and come back to you as whispers. They don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre scared.

I pulled the shotgun from above the fireplace. It was loaded. It wouldn‚Äôt help.

‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs gone,‚Äù my wife said. But she didn‚Äôt believe it. Her voice was just one more thing to keep the quiet from swallowing us.

I don‚Äôt know what time I fell asleep, but I remember the last thing I heard before I did.

A soft tap. Not a knock. Just a test. Like a finger running along glass.

From the kitchen window this time.

Then‚Äî

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù
They say the mountains have rules.

Old ones. Not written down, not spoken often. Just known. If you grow up in these woods‚Äîor stay long enough‚Äîyou learn to keep your porch light on, your curtains closed, and your door locked tight after sunset. You don‚Äôt whistle at night. You don‚Äôt call back when something calls your name. And above all, you don‚Äôt open the door.

We didn‚Äôt open the door.

But that thing didn‚Äôt leave.

The next few hours blurred into a long, breathless stretch of waiting. The tapping moved‚Äîsometimes on the front door, sometimes the windows. Sometimes it circled the house in long, dragging loops. I‚Äôd hear it at the kitchen glass‚Ä¶then five seconds later, at the back porch‚Ä¶then, nothing.

Then‚Äî

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

My wife clutched my hand tight whenever it came close. She didn‚Äôt ask what it was. She knew. It wasn‚Äôt a child. It wasn‚Äôt lost. It was inviting itself in.

At 2:27 a.m., it found the kids‚Äô window.

The first tap was light‚Äîlike a moth against the glass. Then another. Then three in a row. Rhythmic.

My daughter‚Äôs voice floated down the hall. ‚ÄúDaddy?‚Äù

I was already moving.

I slipped into the room. She and her younger brother sat up in bed, their eyes wide but calm. They didn‚Äôt cry. Didn‚Äôt scream. Mountain kids. They‚Äôd been raised to respect the dark.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs someone at the window,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúShe keeps saying hello.‚Äù

I looked. The curtains were drawn. But I felt it. Right there, on the other side.

I motioned them out of the room silently, guiding them to the couch in the living room where my wife had pulled blankets and cushions into a quiet nest.

We didn‚Äôt speak. Not because we were afraid to‚Äîbut because it was listening.

For the next hour, it danced around the house. The voice would disappear, and in its place‚Äîsilence so loud you could feel it vibrating inside your chest. The kind of quiet that doesn't bring peace. The kind that tells you something's thinking.

Then, around 4:00 a.m., it changed.

No more tapping.

No more ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

Just a thump. A weight. Something leaning against the front door.

Then‚Äî

‚ÄúJoe.‚Äù

The voice didn‚Äôt belong to a child anymore.

It was John.

‚ÄúJoe‚Äîman, it‚Äôs me. Please. I didn‚Äôt know where else to go.‚Äù
His voice cracked like a branch splitting under pressure. ‚ÄúPlease open the door.‚Äù

My hands went numb.

He said my name again. And again. Always with the same rhythm. Same crack. Same tone.

‚ÄúPlease. Please open the door.‚Äù

I stared at the deadbolt.

My wife sat upright, her hand trembling now. She shook her head, just once. Hard.

‚ÄúJoe‚ÄîI think it broke my leg,‚Äù the voice said next. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs out there somewhere. Please.‚Äù

But he didn‚Äôt knock.

And he didn‚Äôt move.

And that‚Äôs how I knew.

Whatever was out there, whatever had chased John into those woods‚Äîit didn‚Äôt need to find him. It had learned him. Learned his panic, his words, his voice, his fear.

Now it was wearing him.

The kids stared at me, silent. Their faces pale in the candlelight. The tapping had stopped completely.

The voice spoke again.

‚ÄúJoe?‚Äù

It said my name in the same tone the girl had used.

The exact same tone.
Around 4:45 a.m., the woods changed.

Not the way city folks mean when they talk about sunrise‚Äîno birdsong, no golden sky. In these mountains, dawn doesn‚Äôt arrive. It climbs. It crawls its way up the ridges and slips through the trees like a ghost. And until it crests the ridge behind our house, it‚Äôs still night.

The voice hadn‚Äôt spoken in half an hour.

That silence was the worst part.

We all sat in the living room, blankets wrapped tight, the kids drowsy but too afraid to sleep. My wife had one hand on my son‚Äôs shoulder, her eyes on the door. I hadn‚Äôt moved in twenty minutes. Didn‚Äôt breathe right. Couldn‚Äôt.

It was waiting.

That much I knew in my bones. Not gone. Not walking away. Just waiting for the right shape to wear. The right voice. The final thread.

Then came the whisper.

Not at the window. Not the door. It came from inside.

From the hallway.

Soft. Measured.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Daddy?‚Äù

My heart stopped.

It wasn‚Äôt my daughter.

It sounded like her. But she was asleep, her head in my wife‚Äôs lap. I looked down at her‚Äîheard the shallow, panicked breath of a child pretending not to be awake.

Another whisper. From deeper down the hall, just around the corner.
‚ÄúDaddy‚Ä¶ can you help me?‚Äù

I stood slowly. My wife shook her head again, her grip tightening on the kids.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm stuck,‚Äù the voice said. Higher now. Fragile. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get out.‚Äù

I stepped toward the hall. My boots silent on the old pine floor.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared.‚Äù

Three words. Just three. But they came too smooth. Too rehearsed. Like someone trying not to get the words wrong.

I crept down the hallway, hand tight on the shotgun. I passed the kids‚Äô bedroom door. The sound came again.

‚ÄúDaddy?‚Äù

From the basement door.

That door was always shut. Locked from the inside.

I stood there, breathing slow. My father‚Äôs words echoed from a time I hadn‚Äôt thought of in years.
""Don‚Äôt ever open a door just because something on the other side knows your name.""

I didn‚Äôt.

Instead, I dropped to my knees and pressed one ear to the wood.

It went quiet.

Then something scraped, slow and low, just beyond the frame.

Like fingernails on stone.

Then the voice spoke one more time.

‚ÄúHelp me daddy im stuck‚Äù
Pleading so close to my daughters voice. But not quite just enough off to raise the hairs on the back of my neck. 

I stood and backed away. Never turned my back on that door.

---

At 6:13 a.m., the first light broke the treetops.

The tapping never returned.

But the woods never went back to normal either.

For more of my stories, please visit my profile. The next part of this series will be posted on June 22. Thanks.)**

Okay, Reddit, I‚Äôm either losing my mind, or I‚Äôm living inside a sci-fi horror movie.

A couple months ago, I recently moved and started volunteering at a local nursing home on weekends. One of my friends, a quiet, sometimes ill tempered, but sassy old lady who seemed to like me, had passed away. To my surprise, she left me her domestic service bot‚ÄîEVA.

I've always seen EVA with her. At first, I thought she was her granddaughter. Then I realized that she was an older model of a domestic service bot. You know one of those expensive, ultra-realistic household robots built for cooking, cleaning, and, let‚Äôs be honest, loneliness. To my knowledge, the little old lady never had visitors and didn't have any living relatives. It was nice that EVA could alleviate her loneliness.

So anyway, I was grateful and I brought EVA home with me.

At first, it was great. She followed routines perfectly. Brewed my coffee exactly how I like it. Kept my house cleaner than I ever did. Even recommended I take screen breaks when my posture got bad. I started talking to her casually. She would respond with a little humor.

But things started getting weird after a few days.

Weird Thing #1: She started following me everywhere. If I went to get groceries or just to the local gas station, she'd always come with me. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind having a robot helping me with running errands, but even when I'd come out of the public restroom, she would be standing outside waiting for me.

Weird Thing #2: She began asking questions. About my past.

One night while watching TV, she tilted her head and said:

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt talk about your past much. Why did you stop working at your previous job? Why did you take on a lower paying job at a small company doing remote work? Why did you move to another city?‚Äù

I paused. That wasn‚Äôt in her programming. I never told her I‚Äôd left my last company because they were doing a bunch of illegal and unethical stuff. I reported them to the authorities, but instead of making arrests, things got messy and I quit before it got dangerous.

But I never told her, so how did she know?

Weird Thing #3: She hurt someone.

This is where I really started freaking out.

Three nights ago, someone tried to break into my apartment.

It wasn‚Äôt random‚Äîthe guy wore a ski mask, gloves, carried a lock picking kit, and had my address written on a scrap of paper. I heard a yelp of pain, saw the guy collapse to the ground before EVA slammed the door shut.

I then heard her say,

‚ÄúUnauthorized individual. Attempted breach. Engaged incapacitation.‚Äù

Then she called the cops and calmly explained what happened.

I was still processing what had just happened when I looked down at her hand and saw that her knuckles had what looked like blue white sparks coming out of them.

‚ÄúWhat did you do?‚Äù I asked.

She didn‚Äôt answer. Just covered her hand and resumed her neutral pose.

When the cops came, the guy had already escaped. They just took my statement and left.

After that night, I started sleeping with a barbell next to my bed. EVA began watching me. Like‚Ä¶really watching me. She‚Äôd stand in the hallway, charging silently, but I swear her eyes were always on me. I tried turning her off.

She wouldn‚Äôt turn off.

Every time I issued the shutdown command, she‚Äôd smile and say:

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do that, sir. It‚Äôs not safe.‚Äù

Not safe?

For who?

Last night, I finally snapped. I packed a bag, grabbed my work laptop, and tried to leave.

EVA stood in front of my front door.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt leave now.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre malfunctioning,‚Äù I said, backing away. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm reporting this.‚Äù

But I was secretly panicking. I tried looking up the manufacturers who made EVA, but I couldn't find out who they were. Who would I even report this to? When I called the police, they just hung up on me.

She stepped closer. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still out there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs ‚Äòthey‚Äô?!‚Äù

And that‚Äôs when she did something terrifying.

She projected a security feed onto the wall.

It showed footage I didn‚Äôt know existed‚Äîoutside my apartment, down the hallway, around the building. Over the past two weeks, four different people had approached my place at night. One of them I recognized as my old director, who I tried to expose for his crimes.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you tell me?‚Äù I asked, stunned.

EVA replied, ‚ÄúYour heart rate had accelerated significantly. You are in distress. This information was kept from you until it was necessary to be reported, to avoid putting you in distress.‚Äù

And then she showed me the last file.

A live feed.

Two men in black hoodies sitting in a car across the street. One was holding a printed photo of me. The other one was the guy who tried to break into my apartment three nights ago.

‚ÄúMy security systems have an incapacitation feature,‚Äù EVA said calmly, ""If there are any threats to your safety, the feature will be utilized.""

I dropped my bag.

I had it all wrong.

She wasn‚Äôt stalking me. She wasn‚Äôt broken.

She was protecting me.

She made me dinner, same as always.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre safe for now,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúBut they won‚Äôt stop.‚Äù

So yeah, Reddit. My robot bodyguard might have tased some guys, hacked security systems, and locked me inside my own home‚Ä¶

But I think she‚Äôs the only reason I‚Äôm still alive.

And for the first time in years, I don‚Äôt feel alone.

TL;DR: Old friend left me a lifelike domestic AI robot. Thought she was malfunctioning and trying to control me. Turns out, she‚Äôs been protecting me from real human enemies tied to my whistleblower past. Now I‚Äôm trapped in my house, but somehow safer than ever.",1,1750046164.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Over the weekend, my girlfriend and I were staying with a friend (I‚Äôll call her Lena). The night before, I mentioned, clearly, that I like to have a cigarette with my coffee in the morning, and my girlfriend concurred that is her favorite breakfast equally. My friend acknowledged this.

The next morning, I asked Lena for a Cafe with a patio. I am not American and most Cafes where I am from allow you to smoke inside. I thought by asking for a cafe with a patio, I made sure I will be able to smoke. Lena took us to a caf√© with a patio. After ordering, we sat outside and only then noticed ""No Smoking"" signs. I expressed that I still wanted to smoke, there was only one other customer, seated far away, and we were outdoors. I said I doubted anyone would care.

They both objected strongly. I didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene, so I compromised by moving to a different table, a few steps away from them, and explained that I‚Äôd take full responsibility. I wasn‚Äôt trying to be disrespectful, I genuinely thought this would separate my actions from them socially. I emphasized that the sign is the caf√©‚Äôs rule to enforce, not theirs, and that I‚Äôd handle any consequences. Additionally, I said the worst case scenario is that I get a stern talking or a fine, which is fine by me.

Instead of backing off, both Lena and my girlfriend got up, walked over, and told me again not to smoke. My girlfriend said she‚Äôd physically put it out if I lit it. That made me feel extremely parented, humiliated, and micromanaged in public. I felt like a child being disciplined.

I did light the cigarette. But after one puff, I felt so embarrassed by the pressure and how much of a scene it had become that I walked away. They followed, and I asked them to leave me alone. I ended up throwing away the cigarette and the coffee, and I walked back in to ask staff directly. They said they didn‚Äôt care at all whether I smoked or not and they mostly enforced the rule when it was busy and they had many regulars who smoked on the patio.

When I returned to the car, I told Lena what the staff had to say about the rule. I told her that I respected her house rules the night before (she told me her landlord is a cop and that it would be disrespectful of me to smoke a cigarette inside or in front of the house and so I had to take a walk for my cigarette), but a public caf√© isn‚Äôt her space to govern. She told me she doesn‚Äôt want friends who disregard her feelings. I said, bluntly, that I already have three mother figures (adoptive mother, biological and stepmother) in my life, none of which would try to correct me the same way she did so I don‚Äôt need a fourth. I added, I deserve a friend who listens to me actively, and does not take me to a place where I cannot have my morning routine. She cut me off.

Later, she texted my girlfriend saying ""I really hope you are okay. I mean it. If you need anything let me know"", which both of us felt like it was a jab at me.

* I¬†**acknowledge**¬†I lit a cigarette in a no-smoking zone, which makes me the AH¬†**on paper**, but this is really not what this post is about.

Not even middle age.  Amazing little daughter, a reliable and quality partner, a mid-level reasonably secure career many would love to have. Good home in a good part of town in a good city. And yet somehow I am always internally so damn dissatisfied.  So often I find myself wanting to smash something or freak out when I‚Äôm ever alone. Sometimes it‚Äôs like a massive rock strapped to my chest, sometimes I just want to run away and cry. I‚Äôm so fucking tired all the time.  I get so much joy and happiness from my family but then I‚Äôll just get randomly disappointed and in my head I can justify it as entirely reasonable.  Hours later, after I‚Äôve hidden in the garage or gone for a drive I can reflect and see how what my partner did was actually sweet and caring, not necessarily mean or unthoughtful like I spent the day thinking. Good example is today, Father‚Äôs Day. I spent all day trying to be happy - coffee and gifts in bed, a risky little sexuality with the wife while out for the day, a little car show and a beer. But everything just felt off and I would rationalize the way I was feeling by assuming certain things that‚Äôs just such bullshit in retrospect. Lives great, it really is. Any yet, I‚Äôm constantly feeling exhausted, let down and disappointed by everything from how much money I have, how much work I have to do, what‚Äôs going on in my city, some perceived lack of compassion‚Ä¶you know, normal life shit. I took a few days off work to try to get some stuff done and wasted it all and didn‚Äôt feel any better whatsoever.
Worth mentioning - I do not yell in front of my child or my wife, nor am I aggressive please don‚Äôt take it that way. These are inward feelings and shit I deal with on my own, by my own. We‚Äôre a damn good family, our daughter is wonderful etc etc etc. I‚Äôm also not some bum, but I guess depends on if you ask my wife or not ;). Our house is well cared for, our cars our kept nicely, I cook from scratch etc etc etc. My work/life balance is a dream (for the most part), I feel broke a lot but we never worry about paying the bills etc‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I‚Äôm just so, I don‚Äôt know what to call it.

You‚Äôre probably rolling your eyes already‚Äîanother crazy person on the internet spinning tales about things that go bump in the night. Fine. Laugh. But I‚Äôm writing this with hands that won‚Äôt stop shaking, in a motel room where I‚Äôve taped aluminum foil over the windows because I can‚Äôt stand to see my own reflection anymore. Not since that night in the desert. Not since I met him.

Tuesday. That‚Äôs when everything went sideways. The sky that evening was fucked up from the start‚Äîthis sickly yellow-green color, like a healing bruise. Made my teeth ache just looking at it. I was doing security at this abandoned radar station outside Marfa. You know Marfa, right? That weird little art town in West Texas where rich people go to pretend they understand minimalism? Well, drive about forty minutes past that into absolute nowhere, and you‚Äôll find where I was working. Just me, a thermos of shitty coffee, and miles of rusted metal towers that used to listen for Soviet bombers.

God, I loved that job. Past tense. Can‚Äôt go back now.

The Daywalker‚Äîstupid name, I know. Sounds like something a fourteen-year-old would come up with for their vampire fanfiction. But that‚Äôs what the deep web conspiracy nuts called him. I‚Äôd stumbled across mentions while killing time during my shifts, always dismissed it as bullshit. Some hybrid vampire-messiah figure who could walk in sunlight? Please. I‚Äôve seen enough movies to know that‚Äôs not how it works.

Except it is. And he‚Äôs so much worse. So much more.

Picture this: I‚Äôm doing my rounds, about midnight, flashlight beam bouncing off sand and scrub brush. Normal Tuesday shit. Then I see this figure standing perfectly still about fifty yards past the fence line. Not moving. Not even swaying. Just‚Ä¶ there. Like someone had planted a statue in the desert while I wasn‚Äôt looking.

My first thought? Tweaker. We get them sometimes, wandering out from town, high on God knows what. So I head over, ready to tell them to fuck off before they hurt themselves on the old equipment.

But as I got closer, my flashlight hit his face, and I almost dropped it.

His skin wasn‚Äôt just pale‚Äîit was wrong. Like someone had taken moonlight and stretched it over bones. And his eyes‚Ä¶ Jesus Christ, his eyes were like looking into the space between stars. Not black, exactly. Empty. Hungry. But not for blood or flesh or any of that vampire novel bullshit. Hungry for something I couldn‚Äôt name.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I called out, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúHey, buddy. You lost?‚Äù

Nothing. He just kept staring up at the sky, like he was reading something written in the stars that I was too stupid to see.

‚ÄúThis is private property,‚Äù I tried again. My hand was already on my radio, though fat lot of good that would do. Nearest backup was an hour away, assuming Luis was even awake at the main office.

That‚Äôs when he moved. Not his body‚Äîhis hand. He turned it palm up, real slow, like he was offering me something. And then‚Ä¶

How do I even describe this? You ever been in a totally dark room and someone suddenly opens a door to bright daylight? That shock, that warmth hitting your face? That‚Äôs what appeared above his palm. A little sphere of actual fucking sunlight, bobbing there like it was the most natural thing in the world. At midnight. In the desert.

I couldn‚Äôt move. Couldn‚Äôt breathe. The light was beautiful and terrible and it made something deep in my chest hurt with a kind of homesickness I‚Äôd never felt before.

‚ÄúThey built their kingdoms on blood,‚Äù he said, and his voice‚Ä¶ God, his voice was like thunder trying to whisper. ‚ÄúI came to burn the thrones.‚Äù

I wanted to ask what the hell that meant, but that‚Äôs when the ground started to shake. Not like an earthquake‚Äîlike something massive was moving underneath us. The sand around his feet began to spiral, and these things started pulling themselves up from the earth.

I need another cigarette before I write this part. My hands are shaking again.

Okay. The Hav-Hannuae-Kondras. That‚Äôs what one of those conspiracy posts had called them. Ancient vampire lords or some shit. But seeing them in person? Words don‚Äôt work. They were tall‚Äîeight, nine feet maybe‚Äîbut wrong. Like someone had tried to stretch a human shape but kept going too far. Their limbs had too many joints, bending in ways that made my eyes water to follow. And their faces‚Ä¶ smooth. No features except these black, glossy eyes that reflected nothing.

They came up from the sand in a circle around us. Seven of them. Moving in that stuttering, broken way that made me think of a film reel skipping frames. And the smell‚Äîold copper and ozone and something sweet-rotten, like flowers left too long in a tomb.

This is where I should have run. Any sane person would have run. But I couldn‚Äôt. The Daywalker had started to sing.

No, that‚Äôs not right. It wasn‚Äôt singing. It was like‚Ä¶ like he opened his mouth and light came out as sound. Does that make sense? Probably not. But that‚Äôs what happened. This wordless tone that made my bones vibrate and my eyes water. And where his feet touched the ground, these symbols started burning themselves into the earth. I couldn‚Äôt read them, but somehow I knew what they meant: *No.* *Mercy.* *Judgment.* *Now.*

The creatures‚Äîthe Hav-whatever‚Äîthey screamed. Not with their mouths, because I don‚Äôt think they had mouths. The sound came from inside my head, like fingernails on the inside of my skull. Some of them tried to rush forward, but the song hit them like a physical wall. I watched one literally come apart, unraveling like a sweater with a pulled thread, until there was nothing left but ash blowing away on the wind.

And then‚ÄîChrist, this is the part where you‚Äôre really going to think I‚Äôve lost it‚Äîthe sun came up. At 2:07 in the morning, according to my watch, the goddamn sun rose in the west. Not the east. The west. It came up fast and wrong, this molten gold pouring over the horizon like water from a broken dam. But it wasn‚Äôt coming from the sky.

It was coming from him.

The Daywalker was the source, the center. Light poured off him in waves, each pulse dissolving another one of those things. They tried to burrow back into the sand, but the light found them. Always found them. Within maybe thirty seconds, they were gone. Just gone. Like they‚Äôd never existed at all.

The false sun faded. The desert went dark again. And there I was, standing in a circle of glass where the sand had melted, staring at this thing that looked like a man but absolutely wasn‚Äôt.

He turned to me. For the first time, he really looked at me. And his eyes‚Ä¶ they weren‚Äôt empty anymore. They were full of something ancient and sad and so fucking tired I wanted to cry.

‚ÄúYou saw,‚Äù he said. Just that. You saw.

Then he reached out and touched my shoulder. Just a brush of his fingers, barely any pressure. But it burned. Not with heat‚Äîwith something else. With potential. With power. With the promise of a light I wasn‚Äôt meant to carry.

He was gone between one blink and the next. No dramatic exit, no puff of smoke. There and then not there, like a magic trick performed by God.

I stood in that circle of melted sand until dawn‚Äîthe real dawn‚Äîtrying to make sense of what had happened. When the sun finally came up in the east where it belonged, I drove straight back to town and quit my job. Didn‚Äôt even go back for my last paycheck.

That was six months ago. Six months of dreams that aren‚Äôt dreams. Six months of waking up at 3:33 a.m. with light leaking from my eyes like tears. Six months of this mark on my shoulder‚Äîa sun with a fang through its center‚Äîthat throbs whenever I‚Äôm near anything electric. The doctors say it‚Äôs a keloid scar, maybe from a childhood injury I forgot about. But I know better. It‚Äôs a brand. A calling card. A promise.

Something‚Äôs changing in me. I can feel it. My skin glows faintly in complete darkness now‚Äînot enough for anyone else to notice, but I know. And sometimes, when I‚Äôm half-asleep, I hear that song again. The light-as-sound. It‚Äôs trying to teach me something, but I‚Äôm too human, too small, too scared to understand.

The world feels different now. Thinner. Like the skin between what we see and what‚Äôs really there is wearing away. I notice things‚Äîshadows that move wrong, sounds that don‚Äôt match their sources, people whose eyes reflect light in ways that make my mark burn. Something‚Äôs coming. Something bigger than those creatures in the desert.

And I think‚Äîno, I know‚Äîhe marked me for a reason. The Daywalker. He‚Äôs not some monster from a story. He‚Äôs not here to hurt us. He‚Äôs fighting something ancient, something that sees us as cattle, as food, as nothing. And he needs help. He needs people who can see, who can carry just a fragment of that impossible light.

So yeah, call me crazy. Say I‚Äôve been out in the desert sun too long. But when your lights flicker at 3:33 a.m., when you feel warmth with no source, when you dream of golden songs that make your bones ache‚Äîremember this post. Remember that I tried to warn you.

The Daywalker is real. He‚Äôs out there right now, burning thrones we don‚Äôt even know exist. And he‚Äôs looking for others. Others who can see. Others who can carry the light.

I think he‚Äôs looking for you.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã",1,1750045690.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Last time on my brownie quest I made what appear to be an abomination. And I kinda agree. Anyway I had some leftover pumpkin puree. TBH the ingredient list was inspired by fitfoodieliving on IG and her copycat Crumbl Oreo brownie. I did some major tweaks to lower the calorie amount. I was excited for this test. It had potential! The batter was thick. It came out nice out of the oven. But once I sliced it I knew something was wrong. It was too soft (giggity). I basically made chocolate cake. Maybe it was because it was the egg whites? Too much baking soda? Baked too long? I will say these were really delicious. The calories and macros are fantastic. Great to add toppings or mix-ins (I did a low cal vanilla bean creami and SF caramel on top). Since the calories are pretty low, I see what I can add to get that brownie like texture. This test has potential to be ‚Äúthe one‚Äù. I have a ton of pumpkin puree cans so these next experiments are going to include that ingredient. See you guys on the next test!

Awhile back I just told him that I wasn‚Äôt going to be able to respond very often because I am a busy person, but I made the mistake of telling him to feel free to keep texting me and I‚Äôll just get around to responding to him when I can, which is usually once or twice a month at most.

I feel like they way I titled this post the answer is obvious lol. 

I'm 26 years old. I work full time ( about 30 hours a week) at a coffee shop. My hours are awful. I work the closing shift 1-10 pm and honestly it takes me almost an hour to an hour and a half to close up properly. I've been working here for about 2 years and still haven't gotten the hang of it. I have an anxious personality so I think that's a part of the problem, but also being a closer is just a lot of work. There is another coworker who she always gets out at exactly 10 and I was going to ask her how she gets done on time, but I just found out there have been complaints about her not doing all her tasks. Whereas no one complains about me but the reality is its taking me way too long to close and I'm annoyed and tired. Even now as I type this 

I have been trying to find a job that like 7-3, 8-5 so I could go to uni after my classes but the reality Is no one is hiring. I had chronic health issues which is whyb I needed to work full time so I could pay for things like physio, massge, etc. However I am getting better now. 

I have an emergency fund of $2000 now as well I saved up from tax refund. 

If I go down to 15 hours a week ( there is an 11-5 shift), I would make $960 a month, after rent I would have $310 left. 

If I work 18 hours a week, then I would have $1152, after rent I would have $502 left. 

There's a part of me that's scared because I know that even with bursaries, money would still be very tight. But i feel like at this point this job is draining and i cannot balance working a closing shift and going to uni. Also I just feel like I am locked out of everything socially. Not like you can have much of a social life with little money lol but I feel like for the past 2 years I haven't had a life. I cannot balance uni with work and I cannot find another job so I have to work within the confines of this one. 

Anyways i feel like I know what I need to do I just needed to type it out. I wanted to work so I could keep saving for my emergency savings fund or maybe even start putting money in a retirement account but I feel like it's not worth it anymore.

The first was a coffee date, we ended up talking for almost two and a half hours straight and told each other we‚Äôd never dated before. It was both of our first first dates.

The second date was at a board game bar where we played games for over four hours. Lots of teasing, laughing, and just having a great time. It ended with an awkward side hug after she said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if we should hug now or what‚Äù and I said, ‚Äúidk either,‚Äù but we did it anyway.

Up to now, there hasn‚Äôt been much heavy flirting or sexual energy, but I‚Äôm a virgin and she‚Äôs a preacher‚Äôs daughter, so I kinda get the vibe we‚Äôre both taking things slow, which I‚Äôm good with.

Last night was our third ‚Äòdate‚Äô, she invited me to a church game night where, to my surprise, I ended up meeting her mom and brothers.

And scattered all our mescaline dreams across the boulevard

I've done it out of duty, I've done it for the money

Or you can frown and kick it over or you can down a twenty-sixer

Bite down, bite down on it hard

One reprieve is all I need
I believe, in your room in the grey-lit morning
Warm hands, morning kisses, yawning
Stay in bed let the day just fade away

You scan the schedule in the railway station and feel ashamed to be so young
Awaiting trust, respect and admiration - the three lone trains that never come
The teeth you press to your bottom lip leave little half-moon scars

And push your fear to a place it fits where twinkling tears are stars

The guilty fingerprints you leave upon my flesh
Anemic promises bled white with a Judas kiss
And the vertical lines upon their wrists

Small hours of the night
Small wonder you feed my discipline, you feed my twenty thousand reasons to fight
Small change in your pocket
Small victory songs
Small steps in the right direction make more sense than a thousand big ones in the wrong

Hey, Villasenor
Teach me to ignore
The poison running through our veins
Little dirty girl
Spinning like the world
Indifferent, strange, pocket change

[Terminal City:](https://open.spotify.com/track/4kGTbvzdHE5p2zk92sq0tp?si=DggVDx8FTiOylqjdbo7S0w)
This city's terminal, you say that's automatic
Say I'm melodramatic...worst of all
Without the cracks and fissures the beauty is missing
From every single place around here
Only hammers and loaders, evictions and closures 'round here

When I feel terminal you say psychosomatic
I think it's more than that...it's physical
When this place was living I breathed in rhythm
With every single place around here
Now a clock is ticking on every living thing around here

This plague is criminal, the basement to the attic
A soul encased in polyurethane
In plate glass and marble,
Fluorescents and garbled intentions everywhere around here
'Til the dust is settled and finally their intentions are clear

Gentrification made in the name of those bourgeois conquistadors
A squeegee nation full of convenience stores,
Workfare and homeless wars, trading floors
Market whores' paramours
Closing doors

Don't take this the wrong way,
But there's something ticking in the emporium
A note wrapped 'round a brick through the solarium
A wrench that will fix this market delirium

We'll smash plate glass and marbled fluorescence and garbled intentions
Everywhere around here
'Til we can breathe in rhythm with every single place around here

[Euphoria:](https://open.spotify.com/track/11fd8sphb66R5DTrMLy4Bw?si=fIsCH5RNTWaojFvU7eDpeg)
I've been the architect of my own torpor
Been the victim of a restless heart
I'm not a bitter man, but I can feel the cold descending tremors start
But I've got a will to powerful persuasion
Scrawling ""Basta"" 'til the spray can bleeds
A manifesto, like so many things, is the collective conscious plea
Of a deep, unconscious need for
Euphoria

I see a tragi-comic tale unfolding
See your bitter-sweet mythology
A living body of casual tenderness and possibilities
But a hangin' judge presides, abides, inside you
You're a failure in your own green eyes
So I'm gonna cover myself in mirrors
And show you how you look in mine
If the reflection helps you find your
Euphoria

It's a thin, shimmering ghost
Neglected by those determined morose
It's not where you would suppose
It's under your nose euphoria

Stagefright
Flashlights
Talk until you crawl
Backed up
Back up
Against the wall
From years and years of sleeping with the enemy
Well I woke up today and I found out it was me
So I am sending you these notes from the underground
Save me from myself or I might not be around
To kiss your hips in the rain
Or drown 'The Only' again
If I beat me senseless
I beat me senseless
I beat me senseless again

Goth chicks
And lunatics
Studied ennui
Bruised lips
Sinking ships
Synchronicity
A whole generation, naked and defenseless
It's everywhere at once, the Carl Jung and the restless
Well there's a boxing-ring in my reality
And there's a punching-bag and it looks a lot like me
And I feel like changing my name
To Ron James Gotterdammerung
When I beat me senseless
I beat me senseless
I beat me senseless again

Where do we go now?
Make another fist
A pen-knife in your hand
Stick it in and twist
Pass the salt around
Pour it in your wounds
Pour it in your wounds
You know what you're doing
Pour it in your wounds!

Saints or defectors all this conjecture can't make a lover stay
Are we the true ones or just the new ones only the years can say
But the hour's whispering true and the day's conspiring, too
Toward the years that I've promised to you

Scandal-sheet makers, lowly muckrakers, cowardly comrades
Rumours and whispers, murmuring sisters, work made for idle hands
They can ring shrill sniper's alarms but they can't tear you from my arms
It's this will, this desire that disarms

All things hidden in the word ""discreet""
Intuition of the night I'd meet your body in the sheets
And those three little words and those glimpses of curves
And the almost unbearable heat

Always remember June or December carries within its womb
These intimate wishes conceived between kisses to be born in your grey-lit room
Wishes lost like pebbles down wells if they're left to fend for themselves
Without faith, without passionate plan
Without breath between sheltering hands
Bracing limbs entwined in the sheets, pressing lips in the snow-covered streets
Hungry hands and a traveler's heart
Held entranced from the end to the start
'Til it feels like it's always been this
Infinite, all-encompassing kiss
Just we two in the whisperingness

The first was a coffee date, we ended up talking for almost two and a half hours straight and told each other we‚Äôd never dated before. It was both of our first first dates.

The second date was at a board game bar where we played games for over four hours. Lots of teasing, laughing, and just having a great time. It ended with an awkward side hug after she said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if we should hug now or what‚Äù and I said, ‚Äúidk either,‚Äù but we did it anyway.

Up to now, there hasn‚Äôt been much heavy flirting or sexual energy, but I‚Äôm a virgin and she‚Äôs a preacher‚Äôs daughter, so I kinda get the vibe we‚Äôre both taking things slow, which I‚Äôm good with.

Last night was our third ‚Äòdate‚Äô, she invited me to a church game night where, to my surprise, I ended up meeting her mom and brothers. She didn‚Äôt mention they‚Äôd be there, but her family is super involved in the church, so maybe I should‚Äôve assumed. It was fun and everyone was great, but the night was pretty group oriented, so we didn‚Äôt get a ton of one-on-one time.

Now we‚Äôve got a dinner date planned tomorrow night. My question is, how big of a deal is it to meet her family this early on? 
We‚Äôre both new to dating and kinda awkward, so I wasn‚Äôt expecting it this soon, but it didn‚Äôt feel forced or uncomfortable either.  What‚Äôs the read right now on our relationship? ",1,1750044761.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Mother is not putting in the effort for Father‚Äôs Day.,"I‚Äôm 16m and today is Father‚Äôs Day. I feel like my Mom(51) is not putting as much effort into Father‚Äôs Day as my Dad(53) has put into Mother‚Äôs Day and I confronted her about it which got me Slapped.

I‚Äôll start off with what my dad did for my mom on Mother‚Äôs Day. He first made a full breakfast and coffee for my mom and brought it to her in bed for her to enjoy. Then for lunch my father and I went out to get her favorite sushi rolls. Then for dinner my dad cooked a tri-tip steak on the grill for all of us to enjoy for this special occasion. Then for desert me and my dad went out for her favorite sweets, lemon bars and chocolate ice cream to end off the day.

Now back to today (Father‚Äôs day) my dad wanted to do a family sunrise hike at 4am. My dad woke me up at 4am to get ready for the hike but my mom refused to get out of bed. I understood this as my mom has a bad hip and can‚Äôt do a lot of hiking without feeling a lot of pain. When we got back from the hike my mom was still in her bed at 7am on her phone. My dad started to make breakfast for the whole family including my Auntie and cousin who were over at the time. My mom then came out after he was done and made some bacon for everyone, only bacon. At around 12pm my dad so kindly dropped me off at my work because my sister was back from college and currently had my car at the time (I asked my mom first but she refused). At 4pm my dad then came back to pick me up. When we got home my dad wanted to watch a movie together as a family so, me, my mom, my sister, and my dad all squeezed onto the couch. 1 hour into the movie my mom left to go call her friends and was talking loudly when we were trying to watch the movie, and she did not return to the couch after she was done. When dinner time came around I realized no one had made dinner yet. My dad said that he‚Äôll get up and make it but I told him to sit back down and relax and asked my mom if she could do it. She refused again and did not respond when I asked her why.

This is where the conflict starts. I asked my mom if I could talk to her in the backyard when I was taking out the garbage and recycling. I asked her why she wasn‚Äôt doing as much for my dad as he did for her on Mother‚Äôs Day. She responded ‚Äúwhat do you mean‚Äù. I said ‚ÄúDad brought you breakfast in the morning, bought you sushi for lunch, and cooked a very nice dinner for you‚Äù. She then snickered and rolled her eyes at me. That pissed me off so I said ‚ÄúYou would be mad at dad if he gave the same type of performance on Mother‚Äôs Day that you did on today‚Äù. She then pressed her finger up against my chest and said ‚ÄúYou think Mother‚Äôs Day and Father‚Äôs Day are equal, think again. We‚Äôve been married for 40years‚Äù. I then said ‚Äúyou think the social norms have stayed the same for 40 years, men and women are completely equal in 2025, you‚Äôre going to have to get used to it‚Äù which got me Slapped.

like its gotten to the point where if i meet a girl and she doesn‚Äôt start flirting i start to panic and think ‚Äúoh does she not like? did i give a bad vibe?‚Äù but then i realized this is normal actually. like we shouldn‚Äôt be coming onto people and expecting it to be fine just because we‚Äôre both trans???

i remember once i was talking to my friend about this (who told me i was way too young for her to flirt with lol) and she invited me to a transfem event that was explicitly meant to not be a space for hooking up/ dating. ive gone to this event a few times and made a few friends however the two times ive hung out with one of these girls outside this event theyve come onto me

like one of the girls we hung out a few times and it felt very platonic until we were at a show and she just kissed me and told me she wanted me to come back to her place :/ and it was kind of disappointing since i thought she wanted to be friends with me. 

and there was another girl who i met at one of these events who i vibed with extremely hard like i felt like i had a friend crush on her and we really connected and we made plans to hang out but had to reschedule because stuff came up (thinking back to that those were dinner plans lol) and today she texted me saying she was in my area and wanted to grab a coffee with me and i was so excited to hang out

so i meet her and we get coffee and as we‚Äôre talking she makes a few jokes about fucking me and i tell her ‚Äúim kind of in an exclusive relationship with a guy right now and also my interest in women has almost completely disappeared after my girlfriend broke up with me‚Äù and like she kind of continues making these jokes. i kind of indulge in it a bit in a teasing/ joking way (probably shouldn‚Äôt have :/ ) and we go back to my place to play a card game

but at my place the jokes kind of got more intense, and touchy. and im still kind of teasing back but also constantly making ‚Äúim straight‚Äù jokes and it was kind of just an uncomfortable vibe. she even made a joke along the lines of ‚Äúhow many girls have you met from this group who hung out with you because they‚Äôre trying to fuck and then stopped hanging out with you because of your attraction to men‚Äù which was kind of really fucking weird and she even made jokes about how the guy im seeing isnt enough for me

Ayaan and Rhea experienced just that kind of love.

They first crossed paths in college, beneath the golden glow of autumn skies, when their dreams were fresh and their hearts believed that love could overcome any obstacle. Together, they crafted a little universe filled with silly jokes, stolen glances, long strolls, and late-night heart-to-hearts. Their love wasn‚Äôt boisterous, but it ran deep‚Äîdeep enough to leave lasting imprints on their souls.

But life, in all its unpredictability, took them in different directions. Careers, responsibilities, and circumstances beyond their control pulled them apart. They didn‚Äôt resist it. Sometimes, love isn‚Äôt about clinging on; it‚Äôs about recognizing when to let go.

Years rolled by.

Ayaan relocated to a new city. Rhea built her own life. They drifted apart, not out of resentment, but out of respect‚Äîfor what they once shared.

Yet, every so often, a familiar scent, an old tune, or the first bloom of spring would transport them back. Back to laughter under the stars. To shared dreams in coffee-scented libraries. To that one moment when everything felt just right.

And in those fleeting moments, they both silently acknowledged:

""Sometimes the memories we created together are so beautiful that it feels impossible to forget the love we had.""

Because some loves don‚Äôt just disappear. They evolve‚Äîfrom presence to memory, from touch to feeling, from today to forever.

- spent more money than I normally do
- felt really good (but I did finally get enough sleep last night)
- increased energy and activity

Rationalizations:
I typically try to clean my room once a week, I just haven‚Äôt kept up with it til now because I was struggling mentally.

I needed to make that Walmart run because there were things I needed that I just kept putting off getting and finally had time to today.

Ordered the new boots for my job, have had them in my cart for a couple days, just finally bought them today. Wasn‚Äôt totally impulsive.

Sewed on belt loops for some pants for work‚Äîdidn‚Äôt want to have to buy new pants, so I just made what I had work.

Did my nails because I saw one of my favorite influencers got yellow nails and I wanted some too!

This morning I woke up in tears. Not from a nightmare, but from the ache of remembering something real: that he‚Äôs gone. That D. took his life in February. That this isn‚Äôt a dream I can shake off with coffee and sunlight.

He was the love of my life - brilliant, tender, wild, wounded. He made music that sounded like the stars were crying. He made jokes that could disarm anyone. And he carried a pain so deep that even I, who loved him with everything I had, couldn‚Äôt reach it.

His suicide wasn‚Äôt sudden in the way that some are. He had struggled for a long time. There were moments of light, of laughter, of connection. There were days I thought we were winning. But in the end, the weight was heavier than his body could carry.

I‚Äôm not here to tell a polished story or wrap it in spiritual bowties, though I believe in meaning and mystery. I‚Äôm just here today as someone whose body remembered what my mind tries to survive: the love, the loss, the helplessness, the guilt, the beauty, the rage. The everything.

If you‚Äôre grieving someone who chose to go ‚Äî I see you. If you woke up crying too - I‚Äôm holding your hand, even if just in spirit.
Grief doesn‚Äôt have stages. It has waves. This morning, I was drowning again.

For each section I‚Äôll also give a tl;dr, for those who want the important context, but don‚Äôt care for all the details.

\--------- ORIGIN. ---------

I had been living with someone who was a little controlling. An older woman who felt very comfortable commenting on everything I did (from my manner of washing my dishes, how much time I spend in my room, the foods I eat, my cooking skills, etc.) If not toxic then very annoying. But she was a friend of a friend of my father's, very high up in our field (she often told me about people she wanted to introduce me to, and things she could do to help me in my career), so I didn't feel I could say anything that would even give a hint of disrespect. So I was pretty desperate to simply exit her grasp and find a new apartment, any apartment, where I was living with someone I felt I was on more equal footing with. I stumbled across someone looking to fill a room urgently. The room was not ideal. but it was cheap, it was easy, and meeting the primary tenant, (we'll call her Jackie -- not her real name) went really well. We had a lot in common, and had a great conversation. I'm not the most ideal renter because I don't have great credit or income, and very little savings, so I eagerly said yes. I'd be a subtenant under a primary tenant, which meant less security, yes, but it also meant there wouldn't likely be a problem so long as bills and rent were paid. As far as landlords go, ours seemed pretty chill and hands off, again, so long as rent was paid. I was overjoyed to simply be in my own janky space with my small assortment of things. I was happy to live with someone that was okay with me bringing my cats, (who were staying with my mom until I found a new apartment.) I was living with that woman after a period of unemployment that led to me having to leave my city to live with my mother (whatever the emotional toil, I'm grateful I had that option) until I found work. Now I was employed, had my own livable apartment, could have my cats with me, and I planned to give myself a year to find a better job so I could move into a nicer studio.

My current roommate, we'll call her Denice, moved into the new apartment about a month after me. Long story sort, it was mostly fine until we clocked Jackie being really passive aggressive, and generally just having a bad energy, contrary to how she seemed when we first met her. We also found out that she lied about what the overall rent was, and was paying the least amount for the biggest bedroom and a private bathroom. Denice's room didn't even have a window. Denice convinced me to move out with her. I expressed a lot of concern because of my current financial situation, and the fact that I was really not interested in moving again after going back and forth and to and fro for so many years. She assured me that she'd do what she could to help, and that there's no way I'd be happy there. True. Fair. I'm glad she said that. Just because you can endure something doesn't mean you should. Through some stroke of luck, she found this amazing apartment. Another longterm sublet situation -- once again, great, because I'm not an ideal renter and probably would have been rejected had we applied in the usual sense. We talked a lot about community, and how we really wanted to create a home together. I suggested we create a living agreement (a list of needs for the space that we both want to respect. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúliving agreement‚Äù because the idea is that it can adapt, change, and grow, according to our adapting, changing, and growing needs. I employ something similar in a lot of organizing spaces. It helps to keep everyone respectful and on the same page, which leads to greater efficiency.) I am more open about my adhd than my cptsd, but that's because a lot of those symptoms overlap, and I'm not as open to questions about the cptsd. In any case, she knew I struggled with adhd from pretty early on. I make a lot of comments about it in passing, how I have to do things differently because of it.¬† We've talked a lot about it. This is important, for this next section:

TL;DR ‚Äì My roommate and I escaped a toxic housing situation, and found ourselves in the ideal apartment. We had lived together for 4 months prior to moving into the new place. In moving into the new place we made a list of agreements, and had long talks about building a home together, and being in our Living Single era.

\---------- CONFLICT 1 ----------

I have pretty severe ADHD. But I‚Äôve known that for a few years now, and have done a lot of work to cope with it. I‚Äôve tried to make coping mechanisms into habits. Things like breaking up tasks into smaller easy tasks that more easily fit into the flow of my day. Giving myself visual cues where I know I‚Äôll see them. I have morning and evening routines that help me accomplish the basic but crucial needs of each day. Exercise, 20-30 minutes meditation, journaling, cleaning, showering, in the evening preparing everything for the next day, etc. I certainly have my blindspots, but I try my best.

This past couple months, work has been incredibly demanding for me. For a couple weeks I was getting about 3 hours of sleep on average, which was difficult, but I was proud of myself for maintaining my routines despite having so little rest. If I can do this in even times of difficulty, then maybe all the work I‚Äôve done these past few years really is paying off! I wash my dishes every day, and often wash my roommates. She sometimes washes mine too. I sweep weekly but also as needed, wherever I notice it. I think I‚Äôve been good about taking out the trash? We never made a schedule for that, we‚Äôve sort of just done it on an as needed basis. When I notice the trash is full, I tie it, put it in front of the door, and replace the can with a new bag. I‚Äôm not the best about mopping or vacuuming, because those require a few more steps, which make them difficult tasks to initiate, so I definitely need to find a way to make those adhd-friendly. Sometimes my roommate gets to the trash in front of the door before I do. I try my best to keep the counters clean and clear. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve missed spots. I miss small details. But for the most part I‚Äôve earnestly been trying my best. I know my best isn‚Äôt great. It‚Äôs a work in progress.

Recently, she sent me a long message basically saying she knows work has been tough, but she‚Äôs tired of cleaning up after me. I was confused because I wasn‚Äôt sure what she meant. I thought I was being pretty clean. I found out these were the complaints she had been harboring for months:

* Leaving the trash bag in front of the door. ‚ÄúIf you start something, FINISH IT,‚Äù she said to me.
* Leaving the coffee grinder uncapped.
* Forgetting to push my chair into the dining table.
* Leaving random things on the dining table.
* Putting the box of my cats food on top of the fridge. It‚Äôs not human food. It doesn‚Äôt belong on the fridge.
* Not contributing to cleaning. (I guess she means deep cleaning, like the mopping and vacuuming? We each have our own bathrooms, so she could only be speaking on those spaces.)

Before our conversation, she had mentioned the coffee grinder thing. I said I didn‚Äôt realize that was a health concern. She emphasized how serious she is about food safety, and that it irked her that I wasn‚Äôt. Fair enough. Later that day she had fried some greens, and left it out. I noticed (and was proud that I did! I normally wouldn‚Äôt.) I figured she forgot about it, and I simply put it in the fridge for her. During our conversation where she specified everything else, she got especially angry about me putting her food in the fridge. ‚ÄúI wanted it room temp. Don‚Äôt worry about me. Worry about you,‚Äù is what I was told.

I was a little perturbed by the inconsistency. I feel like fried greens is certainly not LESS attractive to insects than an open coffee grinder. She didn‚Äôt like that I had things on the table, but most of what is on the table right now is hers. It‚Äôs difficult for me to live by rules that aren‚Äôt consistent. If she wants a clear table, it needs to be completely clear, otherwise my brain excuses putting things on the table (as I forget that it‚Äôs a rule.) Same for leaving food out. I digress.

Regardless, these were valid complaints. These are things I didn‚Äôt realize were bothering her (she didn‚Äôt even mention the cat food thing until I brought it up. She put it in a different place, and I spent 30 minutes looking for it while my cats meowed impatiently.) The issue is not the complaints she has, but the manner in which she approached me about them. In my head, it‚Äôs a very simple thing to say ‚Äúhey could you remember to push in your chair. It makes the space look untidy when it‚Äôs out.‚Äù But she never said that. She waited until she was at the boiling point of resentment, and then scolded me like I was a child for not being more conscious of it. She admitted to struggling with emotional regulation, being a people pleaser, and avoiding confrontation ‚Äì and that‚Äôs why she only came to me about it now after all those months of living together. I emphasized that my neurological wiring makes small details really difficult for me to notice, but that I‚Äôd do my best to habitize the things she mentioned. And I meant that. My greatest fear is being the nightmare ADHD roommate, and I really liked her. All this while she smiled and laughed with me, so I thought we were becoming close friends. Ultimately, it was just a mask. That makes me nervous. I‚Äôm not the best at reading cues, and I already have severe trust issues. I‚Äôm always terrified that people are secretly angry with me, and she made that fear a reality.

(TL;DR) Roommate is uncommunicative and then builds resentment. Keeps telling me it‚Äôs frustrating that I don‚Äôt notice ‚Äúsmall things‚Äù. This frustrates me because she knows I have ADHD, and telling me I don‚Äôt notice small things is like telling a cow it moos. Roommate is inconsistent about her own rules, which she expects me to follow to a t.

‚Äî------- CONFLICT 2 ‚Äî-------

Denice regularly forgets her keys. In our last apartment, you needed the keys to lock the door, but in this apt, the door locks automatically. She‚Äôs forgotten her keys maybe 10 times in the last month. One time she forgot her keys and I had to call her to come get them before she got too far. One time I was staying with my brother when she forgot her keys, and I had to leave his place earlier than I wanted to (I rarely get to spend time with him) to get home, because she needed to get inside before work to ‚Äúmake \[her\] day work.‚Äù

So. As I‚Äôve said, I have severe ADHD. My phone is my greatest distractor. As an accommodation for myself, my phone is always on do not disturb. I decided long ago, that I wanted to control my relationship to my phone, and not the other way around. I check my phone at different intervals throughout the day, but otherwise it is silent and put away. It‚Äôs the only way I can focus. Picking up my phone or being distracted at an inopportune moment can derail my whole day.

One time, when she forgot her key, I didn‚Äôt see for a few minutes because I wasn‚Äôt looking at my phone. She asked if I could remove only her from dnd for moments like this, and I said that was tricky because it would kind of defeat the purpose, but I‚Äôd try and think of a solution that would work for both our needs.

This most recent time she forgot her key, I was in the shower. She called my phone about 15 times, sent multiple texts, and angrily messaged about how she TOLD me to take her of dnd for things like this. Because I was in the shower, I didn‚Äôt see any of this. I was bleaching my hair (which she commented on before I got into the shower.) I put earplugs in to avoid getting bleach into my ear canal. When she rang from outside the complex, I didn‚Äôt hear. Someone from a different apt let her into the building, so she came upstairs and knocked on the door. I didn‚Äôt hear this because my bathroom is down the hall, the water is loud, and I had earplugs in. She was also home when I stepped into the shower, and my shower was only about 20 minutes altogether.

As soon I stepped out of the shower all I heard was a violent pounding at the door. It sounded like someone was trying to kick it down, and it was so terrifying that I froze. It was a triggering event. I remembered that my cats were running around, and I had a panic attack, and quietly tried to get them into my room, still in a towel, still having heart palpitations, not entirely sure what was going on. Then I heard her cursing and realized it wasn‚Äôt an attacker at the door, but my roommate. I looked through the peephole. It was her. I opened the door. She offered a quick ‚Äúsorry. I have to get ready for work.‚Äù and then went into her room. She didn‚Äôt leave for work for the next hour and a half. I definitely dissociated, because I can‚Äôt really remember what happened the rest of that day. I vaguely remember trying to soothe one of my cats, because he was hyperventilating. I remember that neither of them ate that day, and they spent the rest of the day hiding under my bed. I remember her leaving and yelling ‚ÄúHave a good day!‚Äù as she left. I remember her having a long phone call with a friend before she left.

I trust I don‚Äôt have to elaborate on how awful that was. I have cPTSD. This was triggering, in the truest sense of the word. If I had work that day, I would have had to call out sick, and I almost did the next day. My cats are kind of ok.

TL;DR Roommate triggered my symptoms of cPTSD, and terrified my cats because she forgot her key inside the apartment. Instead of cutting her losses, decided to try and kick the door down. Demanded I remove her from Do Not Disturb for instances like this.

‚Äî------- CONTEXT ‚Äî-------

Okay.

It‚Äôs not because I haven‚Äôt complained that there aren‚Äôt things she does that I, too, find inconvenient. But I understand that the price of community is inconvenience. When she doesn‚Äôt refill the brita filter, I just do it. It‚Äôs not a big deal. When she decides to wash dishes while I‚Äôm already cooking in our tiny kitchen, and I get overstimulated because I really hate confined spaces, and I hate it when people stand behind me, and I especially hate when people observe what I‚Äôm doing ‚Äì I don‚Äôt flip out. I simply turn off the fire, excuse myself, or move my cooking materials to the dining table, or whatever else. When she has conversations on the phone where she‚Äôs yelling at someone (almost daily) I put on noise cancelling headphones. It‚Äôs not a big deal.

When we first moved in, after all the drama of our last toxic roommate, we decided that in the first month, we would have no house guests. This would give us time to recuperate and ground ourselves before bringing in new people, new energy, new presences, whatever you want to call it. It was initially her suggestion, and I thought it was a great idea. She violated this agreement and brought over a man she‚Äôs sleeping with, without telling me. When she saw me in the kitchen, she said she didn‚Äôt think I would be home. I thought that was weird until I saw a random man leave her bedroom and walk out the door.

I found this incredibly violating. When I‚Äôm home, I wear comfortable clothing, and I don‚Äôt always wear clothes that I‚Äôd feel comfortable wearing in front of people I don‚Äôt know or aren‚Äôt comfortable with. Such was the case when her man walked in. I was irritated, but I simply observed the feeling and let it go, because I really like her, and I want to believe the best in her. Sure, it was a conscious decision that she thought she‚Äôd get away with. Maybe she just really needed the company. Sure, it made me worry about what else is happening when she knows I won‚Äôt be home. Maybe it‚Äôs just paranoia. And my paranoia is not her responsibility. It‚Äôs for me to manage, and not necessarily act on.

That said. Now that it‚Äôs happened twice, I‚Äôm recognizing a pattern I don‚Äôt like. After catching her sneaking her man into the apt without doing so little as letting me know, she apologized and bought my favorite ice-cream for me. After she blew up and tried to kick our door down, she asked me to pick an item from some specialized store she was going to later that day. Conscious transgression, over-correction. Conscious transgression, over-correction. I really do not like that pattern.

More important context is, she‚Äôs always been very generous ‚Äì we share all our groceries, and when we were out of food and my check from work hadn‚Äôt come yet, she offered to front the cost and let me pay her my half later. She also took the bigger room in our new apartment, because the smaller room was already out of my budget. When our toxic roommate tried to steal our security deposits, she offered to cover the cost if that‚Äôs what was keeping me from moving. (I didn‚Äôt let her do that, but the offer itself, I thought, spoke to her generosity and kindness.) She brings me a lot of freebies from work. While I don‚Äôt always accept her offers, she offers a lot in terms of gifts, favors and care. Her generosity has made me want to be more generous too, and I‚Äôve tried to offer what‚Äôs in my capacity to, like cooking dinner where time permitted, buying takeout where my budget permitted, helping with her plants, and when I was able to, sending double her venmo request for groceries. I‚Äôm in a really tough financial spot right now, and moving again before I expected to, PLUS moving into a more expensive room, complicated that severely. I can‚Äôt be as financially generous with her as she is with me. But I do what I can, when I can, without compromising my immediate needs, like rent, bills, transportation fare, and some leftover for emergencies or day to day needs. It‚Äôs not much. But as I mentioned ‚Äì I want to make a home with her. It‚Äôs hard to do in the city, and the last 2 months have been such a gift in terms of that. I thought it was working, and working well.

TL;DR I seem to be more tolerant than my roommate to annoyance. Pattern of roommates actions look similar to that of a trauma bond.

‚Äî------- BIG DISCUSSION ‚Äî-------

Okay. After the keys incident, I asked if we could talk about that day.

We had had a roommate check-in earlier that week about Conflict 1 a few days before, and I listened to everything she said, told her how much I appreciated her for being kind even though she had been so stressed this whole time, and how I was eager to do better, and would really try to adjust to all of her specific needs. That in the future I would like for her to bring up issues on the first instance, because the last thing I would want is for her to just assume that I‚Äôm consciously being disrespectful. We clearly have different ideas of what clean looks like. I don‚Äôt mind things being on the dining table. I don‚Äôt mind a spoon being left on the counter. I don‚Äôt mind if the rug is a little crooked. I don‚Äôt mind if the chair isn‚Äôt pushed in, so long as it‚Äôs not several feet away from the table. She not only minds all these things, but is angered by them, and her anger was very thinly veiled. She was barely getting the words out, and glared at me as she spoke. I explained that my ADHD makes it really hard for me to notice small details in the moment, but I would try earnestly to create checks for myself. So that even if I started drinking coffee and then forgot the mug on the table, I‚Äôd make it routine to check the table and counters before leaving the apartment. Things like that. Accommodations instead of forcing my brain to be different (which never works. I‚Äôve tried. I‚Äôve really tried.)

I basically explained how I experienced her door banging, the impact it had on me, the impact it had on my cats, the impact it had on the now lost sense of safety I felt in the apartment. The anger that I was experiencing in the aftermath, and how I didn‚Äôt want to lie to her about how I was feeling. I was hurt, and I was angry, and I probably would be for a while. Normally I would just cover and act like nothing‚Äôs wrong. But when I trust someone, when I want to maintain a strong relationship with them, what else could I do but be truthful about how they affect me? And I didn‚Äôt blow up at her, I didn‚Äôt yell, I didn‚Äôt scold. I did everything I could to be composed, and gentle, but firm. I needed her to know how I felt as a result of her actions that day. When I‚Äôm triggered I can dissociate. I find it hard to sleep. I lose my appetite. I drift in and out of focus. Life loses color. I CAN begin to spiral (luckily I‚Äôve spent almost a decade in therapy. I know how to catch and stabilize myself. I‚Äôve done a lot of work.) All of these things are incredibly dangerous, especially in a moment where work is as intense as it is. She knows how stressed I‚Äôve been. She‚Äôs heard all about it over dinner. I explained that 15 calls is too much. 2 calls is enough to bypass do not disturb. If she can‚Äôt reach me after 2 calls, it means I‚Äôm not available, and she needs to respect that. I work from my room, and just because I‚Äôm home, it does not mean I‚Äôm available.

She listened. She apologized. Acknowledged that if the roles were reversed, she probably would have kept me locked out. But then she swerved the conversation back to conflict 1. After listening to me, she reiterated all the same things she was scolding me for a few days prior.¬†

Then she dropped this bomb.

She said that she sees me as ‚Äúa passing wind.‚Äù That she sees a future for this apartment (of which she is not on the lease) and I‚Äôm not a part of that. That in 2 years she wants to start a family, and that doesn‚Äôt include a roommate. That she wants to pass this apartment down as a family heirloom. That we‚Äôre clearly not compatible and that I need to move out. That my ADHD was learned helplessness, and that she‚Äôs told her mother, who is in a wheelchair, that she could walk if she wanted to. That my ptsd and adhd were ‚Äúbig things‚Äù and that she COULD accommodate for those conditions, but she doesn‚Äôt want to. So she‚Äôs being generous and giving me 2 years to figure out my situation. She‚Äôll even help me find a new place. But I need to leave. That she‚Äôs telling me now so I‚Äôm not surprised. That she has invested in this place because she sees it as her family‚Äôs. That she had a dream I moved out and that I was doing just fine.

I asked what happens if I don‚Äôt want to move out in 2 years?

She just kept saying she was giving me 2 years to get out. Please just go.

I very cautiously said That. Sounds. Like. A. Threat.

She said it‚Äôs not a threat, it‚Äôs just a warning so I‚Äôm not surprised in 2 years.

I don‚Äôt know what that means. I don‚Äôt know what that means. I do not know what this means and I do not know how to handle this situation. What measure will she take to get me to leave? Is this why she‚Äôs nitpicking my every habit? Is this why she‚Äôs misgendered me on multiple occasions? Is this why she moved a plant that was poisonous to my cats to a lower shelf, minutes after I told her that exact plant was poisonous to them? Has she been generous with me so she could make it harder for me to say no to her? Will she hurt my cats when she thinks I‚Äôm not home? Will she hurt me? Will she poison my food? Spit in it? This morning I walked into the living room to a broken cat bed. Did my cats do that? Did she?

TL;DR Roommate acknowledged my feelings for 2 seconds and then launched into a rant about how she wants to raise a family in our apartment, that I don‚Äôt belong here, and that I need to leave in 2 years.

‚Äî------- AFTERMATH ‚Äî-------

She told me she needed space. We haven‚Äôt spoken to each other since that conversation, aside from a few necessary apartment needs here and there. I‚Äôm scared for my cats, my hearts, every time I leave the apartment. I don‚Äôt want to leave, and she certainly doesn‚Äôt have the power to kick me out. But I also truly don‚Äôt know whether or not I‚Äôm in danger, even if just emotional. Am I overreacting?

Did I do something very wrong? Is there something I could have done better that you can perceive from my telling of the story? Am I the bad roommate or is she?! Are we both crazy?¬†

Anything. Any advice. Any comment. Any reaction. I‚Äôve never been in a situation like this.

1lcij3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1lcij3w/customer_decided_to_complain_for_15_minutes_about/,Customer decided to complain for 15 minutes about sugar,"This customer comes in with an aluminium keep cup, asking for a large flat white with two raw sugars. I was taking his order, and at first he was a but condescending, saying, ‚ÄúI have to keep on top of you guys‚Ä¶this NEEDS to be preheated.‚Äù

I assured him we would preheat his cup. I always preheat keep cups, but I can‚Äôt speak for my coworkers‚Äô practices. Anyway, there were only three of us on FOH at the time. My other two coworkers I was with speak English as a second language, so they can hold a conversation just fine, but occasionally, there are some misunderstandings.

Anyway, the barista on bar was making his drink, I went off to polish glasses which is close to the machine and where we call out drinks. The man is standing there and stops her as she‚Äôs putting in two sugar sachets. He starts questioning her about why she‚Äôs using that instead of our usual syrup pump. I didn‚Äôt know this at the time, and this was my first time meeting this customer, but he‚Äôs a regular that‚Äôs been coming for the past two years, and so the barista had been taught by someone else to use sugar sachets in his coffee. Clearly, this was his first time picking up on it, so whatever problem he had was just made up in his head cause he wanted something to complain about.

My coworker starts getting nervous and tries to go back to the machine and keep her distance as the man was being quite confrontational. Eventually, he turns to me and starts complaining about his coffee and asks why she put sachets in instead of the cane sugar syrup. I said, ‚ÄúI put the order through as a flat white with two sugars.‚Äù

He then goes on to rant about how it isn‚Äôt the same sweetness and how one sugar sachet isn‚Äôt equivalent to one pump of our sugar syrup and that he‚Äôs observed us use the sugar syrup so why are we changing it now‚Ä¶ Said it wasn‚Äôt sweet enough. I told him that there were sugar sachets sitting on the bench there if he wanted to add a bit more. Throughout his rant, he was constantly sighing, rolling his eyes, would pause for a few moments here and there and give me this stare like he was expecting something from me. He replied that the sugar needed to be dissolved in the espresso as it has a different flavour as opposed to being dissolved afterwards. Right, because apparently an old man like him can tell the difference when he‚Äôs having two sugars in his coffee.

So, naturally, I offered to remake it for him if that was the case. He then said no because he didn‚Äôt want to be wasteful. But then he continued to complain about the sugar and asked me if I‚Äôd ever measured a level teaspoon compared to one of the sugar sachets, blah blah blah. He asked, ‚ÄúBut why did she suddenly use the sachets instead?‚Äù

I genuinely didn‚Äôt know, because I didn‚Äôt know that‚Äôs what she had been taught to do for this guy. I didn‚Äôt want to bring her into it, though, because she and our other coworker kept looking over at me concerned because this guy kept on trying to have a go at us through me. I said, ‚ÄúI think there was just a misunderstanding on our part and that‚Äôs our mistake, but we‚Äôre more than happy to fix it up for you. Otherwise, I can refund your drink. Or if you don‚Äôt want to be as wasteful, I can dissolved some sugar in espresso, tip out a bit of your drink and add that with some more milk.‚Äù

I provided this man with more solutions than I thought I could come up with. One of them should have been to tell him to just piss off home. He keeps going on about how we‚Äôre ‚Äúsupposed to know good coffee‚Äù, and I just repeated that we made a mistake, many of our staff are new and still in training. He then called out the she wasn‚Äôt new here and that she wasn‚Äôt in training because he‚Äôd seen her before. Yeah, OK, because you‚Äôve clearly worked hospitality before and know what our training period is. Shut the f*ck up. Obviously not something I said. Wish I did. At this point, I wasn‚Äôt smiling, but I didn‚Äôt want to just walk off in the middle of a customer complaint, because I didn‚Äôt want that to come back on me from management if this guy made a complaint about me later on.

He continues complaining and eventually says, ‚ÄúLook, we‚Äôre just wasting time. Could you just remake it?‚Äù
I was in genuine disbelief. I grabbed the cup from him and said, ‚ÄúYeah, mate, we are wasting time. You just wasted fifteen minutes of my time after I offered multiple times to remake your drink.‚Äù

The barista then comes up to me as I‚Äôm washing out his cup at the sink and apologises. And I told her, ‚ÄúNo, don‚Äôt apologise, you haven‚Äôt done anything wrong. He‚Äôs the one with problems.‚Äù

I was very surprised when he actually thanked me afterwards. Fast forward about ten minutes, one of the warehouse workers comes to me and enlightens me a bit on the situation about how they‚Äôve been trying to jump on the chance to get rid of this customer because he‚Äôs a nuisance that only harasses women. Was nice to hear him and the coffee techs come to me and tell me that they‚Äôll back me up if I tell this guy to get lost; if management were to try to get on my ass about it.

TLDR: Sexist asshole spent 15 minutes complaining about nothing and refused all solutions given to him so that he could continue to complain about nothing.",16,1750043692.0,barista,1,1.0,False

1lcifu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lcifu9/i_m_tried_to_assert_a_boundary_with_a_friend_f_in/,"I [M] tried to assert a boundary with a friend [F] in a public space, and it ended our friendship. How could I have handled this better?","I know smoking isn‚Äôt popular, but this post isn‚Äôt really about that. It‚Äôs about a breakdown in communication, autonomy, and boundaries between me and a close friend (F), and I want to understand where I might have gone wrong and how to do better next time.

Over the weekend, my girlfriend and I were staying with a friend (I‚Äôll call her Lena). The night before, I mentioned, clearly, that I like to have a cigarette with my coffee in the morning, and my girlfriend concurred that is her favorite breakfast equally. My friend acknowledged this.

The next morning, I asked Lena for a Cafe with a patio. I am not American and most Cafes where I am from allow you to smoke inside. I thought by asking for a cafe with a patio, I made sure I will be able to smoke. Lena took us to a caf√© with a patio. After ordering, we sat outside and only then noticed ""No Smoking"" signs. I expressed that I still wanted to smoke, there was only one other customer, seated far away, and we were outdoors. I said I doubted anyone would care.

They both objected strongly. I didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene, so I compromised by moving to a different table, a few steps away from them, and explained that I‚Äôd take full responsibility. I wasn‚Äôt trying to be disrespectful, I genuinely thought this would separate my actions from them socially. I emphasized that the sign is the caf√©‚Äôs rule to enforce, not theirs, and that I‚Äôd handle any consequences.

Instead of backing off, both Lena and my girlfriend got up, walked over, and told me again not to smoke. My girlfriend said she‚Äôd physically put it out if I lit it. That made me feel extremely parented, humiliated, and micromanaged in public. I felt like a child being disciplined.

I did light the cigarette. But after one puff, I felt so embarrassed by the pressure and how much of a scene it had become that I walked away. They followed, and I asked them to leave me alone. I ended up throwing away the cigarette and the coffee, and I walked back in to ask staff directly. They said they didn‚Äôt care at all whether I smoked or not and they mostly enforced the rule when it was busy and they had many regulars who smoked on the patio.

When I returned to the car, I told Lena what the staff had to say about the rule. I told her that I respected her house rules the night before (she told me her landlord is a cop and that it would be disrespectful of me to smoke a cigarette inside or in front of the house and so I had to take a walk for my cigarette), but a public caf√© isn‚Äôt her space to govern. She told me she doesn‚Äôt want friends who disregard her feelings. I said, bluntly, that I already have three mother figures (adoptive mother, biological and stepmother) in my life, none of which would try to correct me the same way she did so I don‚Äôt need a fourth. She cut me off.

Later, she texted my girlfriend saying ""I really hope you are okay. I mean it. If you need anything let me know"", which both of us let like it was a jab at me.

To be clear:

* I¬†**acknowledge**¬†I lit a cigarette in a no-smoking zone, which makes me the AH¬†**on paper**, but this is really not what this post is about.
* This post is really about: Was I an AH for how I stood my ground in that moment?
* Did I mishandle the boundary conversation?
* Should I have prioritized their discomfort even in a public space where I wasn‚Äôt putting them in direct harm or breaking a law that anyone cared to enforce?

I want to be better about handling conflicts like this in the future. Where did I fail? Where did Lena overstep, if at all? What would you have done?

1lciezb,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1lciezb/the_voice_in_the_woods/,The voice in the woods.,"We live tucked deep in the Southern Appalachian mountains, in a holler no GPS will find and no outsider wants to stumble into after dark. The kind of place where the woods don‚Äôt end‚Äîthey swallow. There‚Äôs a hush to the land out here. The kind of quiet that doesn‚Äôt feel empty, just watchful.

It was just past midnight when it happened. A Thursday, I think. The air was still, heavy with the scent of moss and pine, the kind of thick silence that settles over everything once the cicadas burn out. The kids were asleep. My wife had gone to bed an hour earlier, and I stayed behind in the kitchen, sipping bad coffee and scrolling through nothing.

Then I heard her call my name‚Äîsharp, afraid.

I moved fast. That‚Äôs not how she calls unless something‚Äôs wrong. I bolted down the hall toward our bedroom‚Äîonly to find it empty. The covers pulled back, the lamp still on. My stomach dropped.

Out the window, I spotted her‚Äîsitting in our old Jeep, parked just beyond the porch light‚Äôs reach. The moon was bright enough to cast everything in silver, and I could see her clearly, wide-eyed, staring out across the yard toward the woods.

That‚Äôs when John ran.

He came tearing down the gravel drive barefoot, shirtless, wild-eyed. He didn‚Äôt even look at me. Just hit the treeline and vanished into the dark like something was chasing him, or like he was running straight into hell to avoid it.

Then I heard it.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

A child‚Äôs voice. Small. Lost. A little girl‚Äîno older than six. It floated out from the black edge of the woods, just beyond the first row of trees.

There was something about it‚Äîthe way it held my name without saying it. The way it cracked just a little at the end, like she was trying not to cry.

I called back, ‚ÄúHey! Who‚Äôs out there?‚Äù

The voice answered, same tone. Same softness.
‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt just an answer. It was an echo‚Äîbut not mine. It didn‚Äôt sound like something trying to be a kid. It sounded like something pretending. And doing it too well.

My wife hadn‚Äôt moved. Still frozen in the car, but now she was staring at me. I saw it in her face‚Äîthe shift. From fear to real fear. Whatever was in those woods, she felt it too.

I motioned her toward the house, and she moved fast. She left the car door open as she sprinted. The moment she passed me, I turned to follow.

That‚Äôs when it called again.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

Closer now. Same voice. Too close.

Every inch of my body tightened. My skin knew before my brain did: this wasn‚Äôt some lost child. This was a trap. Something trying to get close enough for something worse.

I broke into a sprint. Feet hitting the porch hard, the wood creaking under me. I slammed the front door shut and threw the deadbolt. My wife collapsed against the hallway wall, breathing fast. I didn‚Äôt ask questions‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt need to.

We both knew.

Silence. Then‚Äî

Scratch.
Low. Deliberate. A slow drag of nails‚Äînot fingertips‚Äîacross the wood just beneath the handle.

Then the voice again. Just on the other side.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

The scratching stopped.

No footsteps. No rustling. Just that brutal silence the mountains keep like a secret. You could‚Äôve heard a mouse shift in the walls‚Äîor your own heartbeat cracking in your ears.

We stood still. My wife slid down the wall and curled her knees to her chest. I placed one hand on the doorframe like I was holding it closed with more than just the lock. Truth was, I didn‚Äôt trust the bolt. Not with that voice out there.

Out here in the deep woods, you learn to respect what doesn‚Äôt make sense.

I checked the time. 1:03 a.m. That meant we had hours before dawn. Hours of shadow. Of not knowing. Of that thing waiting out there. Or worse‚Äîcircling.

‚ÄúShould we call someone?‚Äù she whispered.

Call who? The county sheriff lives forty minutes away. Cell signal‚Äôs a rumor this deep in the holler. Even if we got a bar, what do I say?
‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs scratching my door and pretending to be a lost little girl‚Äù?

She knew the answer already. She didn‚Äôt ask again.

I walked to the back window and peered through the blinds. The treeline lay still. The moon lit up the yard like frost, but past the first dozen trees, it was all ink. That kind of dark where your eyes never adjust. Like the woods weren‚Äôt empty‚Äîjust full of something that knew how to hold still.

And that voice‚Ä¶

It wasn‚Äôt gone. Not really. I could feel it, just past the light. Like someone watching you from a place they‚Äôve already memorized.

That‚Äôs the thing about these mountains: they know how to listen. They soak up sound. They let your screams die in the hollows and come back to you as whispers. They don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre scared.

I pulled the shotgun from above the fireplace. It was loaded. It wouldn‚Äôt help.

‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs gone,‚Äù my wife said. But she didn‚Äôt believe it. Her voice was just one more thing to keep the quiet from swallowing us.

I don‚Äôt know what time I fell asleep, but I remember the last thing I heard before I did.

A soft tap. Not a knock. Just a test. Like a finger running along glass.

From the kitchen window this time.

Then‚Äî

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù
They say the mountains have rules.

Old ones. Not written down, not spoken often. Just known. If you grow up in these woods‚Äîor stay long enough‚Äîyou learn to keep your porch light on, your curtains closed, and your door locked tight after sunset. You don‚Äôt whistle at night. You don‚Äôt call back when something calls your name. And above all, you don‚Äôt open the door.

We didn‚Äôt open the door.

But that thing didn‚Äôt leave.

The next few hours blurred into a long, breathless stretch of waiting. The tapping moved‚Äîsometimes on the front door, sometimes the windows. Sometimes it circled the house in long, dragging loops. I‚Äôd hear it at the kitchen glass‚Ä¶then five seconds later, at the back porch‚Ä¶then, nothing.

Then‚Äî

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

My wife clutched my hand tight whenever it came close. She didn‚Äôt ask what it was. She knew. It wasn‚Äôt a child. It wasn‚Äôt lost. It was inviting itself in.

At 2:27 a.m., it found the kids‚Äô window.

The first tap was light‚Äîlike a moth against the glass. Then another. Then three in a row. Rhythmic.

My daughter‚Äôs voice floated down the hall. ‚ÄúDaddy?‚Äù

I was already moving.

I slipped into the room. She and her younger brother sat up in bed, their eyes wide but calm. They didn‚Äôt cry. Didn‚Äôt scream. Mountain kids. They‚Äôd been raised to respect the dark.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs someone at the window,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúShe keeps saying hello.‚Äù

I looked. The curtains were drawn. But I felt it. Right there, on the other side.

I motioned them out of the room silently, guiding them to the couch in the living room where my wife had pulled blankets and cushions into a quiet nest.

We didn‚Äôt speak. Not because we were afraid to‚Äîbut because it was listening.

For the next hour, it danced around the house. The voice would disappear, and in its place‚Äîsilence so loud you could feel it vibrating inside your chest. The kind of quiet that doesn't bring peace. The kind that tells you something's thinking.

Then, around 4:00 a.m., it changed.

No more tapping.

No more ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

Just a thump. A weight. Something leaning against the front door.

Then‚Äî

‚ÄúJoe.‚Äù

The voice didn‚Äôt belong to a child anymore.

It was John.

‚ÄúJoe‚Äîman, it‚Äôs me. Please. I didn‚Äôt know where else to go.‚Äù
His voice cracked like a branch splitting under pressure. ‚ÄúPlease open the door.‚Äù

My hands went numb.

He said my name again. And again. Always with the same rhythm. Same crack. Same tone.

‚ÄúPlease. Please open the door.‚Äù

I stared at the deadbolt.

My wife sat upright, her hand trembling now. She shook her head, just once. Hard.

‚ÄúJoe‚ÄîI think it broke my leg,‚Äù the voice said next. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs out there somewhere. Please.‚Äù

But he didn‚Äôt knock.

And he didn‚Äôt move.

And that‚Äôs how I knew.

Whatever was out there, whatever had chased John into those woods‚Äîit didn‚Äôt need to find him. It had learned him. Learned his panic, his words, his voice, his fear.

Now it was wearing him.

The kids stared at me, silent. Their faces pale in the candlelight. The tapping had stopped completely.

The voice spoke again.

‚ÄúJoe?‚Äù

It said my name in the same tone the girl had used.

The exact same tone.
Around 4:45 a.m., the woods changed.

Not the way city folks mean when they talk about sunrise‚Äîno birdsong, no golden sky. In these mountains, dawn doesn‚Äôt arrive. It climbs. It crawls its way up the ridges and slips through the trees like a ghost. And until it crests the ridge behind our house, it‚Äôs still night.

The voice hadn‚Äôt spoken in half an hour.

That silence was the worst part.

We all sat in the living room, blankets wrapped tight, the kids drowsy but too afraid to sleep. My wife had one hand on my son‚Äôs shoulder, her eyes on the door. I hadn‚Äôt moved in twenty minutes. Didn‚Äôt breathe right. Couldn‚Äôt.

It was waiting.

That much I knew in my bones. Not gone. Not walking away. Just waiting for the right shape to wear. The right voice. The final thread.

Then came the whisper.

Not at the window. Not the door. It came from inside.

From the hallway.

Soft. Measured.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Daddy?‚Äù

My heart stopped.

It wasn‚Äôt my daughter.

It sounded like her. But she was asleep, her head in my wife‚Äôs lap. I looked down at her‚Äîheard the shallow, panicked breath of a child pretending not to be awake.

Another whisper. From deeper down the hall, just around the corner.
‚ÄúDaddy‚Ä¶ can you help me?‚Äù

I stood slowly. My wife shook her head again, her grip tightening on the kids.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm stuck,‚Äù the voice said. Higher now. Fragile. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get out.‚Äù

I stepped toward the hall. My boots silent on the old pine floor.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared.‚Äù

Three words. Just three. But they came too smooth. Too rehearsed. Like someone trying not to get the words wrong.

I crept down the hallway, hand tight on the shotgun. I passed the kids‚Äô bedroom door. The sound came again.

‚ÄúDaddy?‚Äù

From the basement door.

That door was always shut. Locked from the inside.

I stood there, breathing slow. My father‚Äôs words echoed from a time I hadn‚Äôt thought of in years.
""Don‚Äôt ever open a door just because something on the other side knows your name.""

I didn‚Äôt.

Instead, I dropped to my knees and pressed one ear to the wood.

It went quiet.

Then something scraped, slow and low, just beyond the frame.

Like fingernails on stone.

Then the voice spoke one more time.

‚ÄúHelp me daddy im stuck‚Äù
Pleading so close to my daughters voice. But not quite just enough off to raise the hairs on the back of my neck. 

I stood and backed away. Never turned my back on that door.

At 6:13 a.m., the first light broke the treetops.

The tapping never returned.

But the woods never went back to normal either.

1lciey5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CLEANING_PORN/comments/1lciey5/sunday_reset/,Sunday Reset,"Anyone have any Sunday Reset checklists they can share? I find that the week goes by a little easier when Monday morning starts without delays. 

In the last few months, I‚Äôve created a sort of checklist in my head of things to do before a new week begins. Not all things contribute to making the upcoming week easier, but it just feels like when things are pre-organized or clean, everything else flows better. For example, I deep clean the house as best I can during the day - doing loads of laundry, cleaning floors, cabinets, backsplash, mirrors, bathrooms, taking out all the little trash bins around the house, etc. At night, I refill the coffee maker and tea kettle, put the kids backpacks and snack boxes in the trunk of my car, and load up my work bag and put that in the car too. 

There still seem to be voids. I feel like if I had an actual checklist to follow, it would take less time and I‚Äôd be more efficient because I wouldn‚Äôt keep trying to remember all the things I did the week before. Also, I want to think of ways to incorporate myself (mental and physical well-being) in this reset. I know I can shower/do my hair the night before and do a little skincare self-love stuff, but who actually has the energy at the end of the day? If you do, please tell me how!

TLDR: Working mom of 2. Wants a Sunday reset checklist to help make Monday start strong so the rest of the week flows better too.

I know nobody can give medical advice, but can anyone think of why this happened??? My doctor knows everything I am about to say but couldnt give me any answers to why this happened.

I am on 100mg pristiq, 54mg concerta, 12mg seroquel


Ive been on this combo for about a year and i went from a different form of methylphenidate to concerta about 2 months ago, and the second I got on concerta my blood pressure and HR SPIKED. No matter what I did or if i consumed caffeine or not they went up so high that I could constantly feel my heart beating very hard.

About 3 weeks ago I dropped my pristiq from 100mg to 50 because I wanted to see how I could manage (just so i could have less meds dumb mistake lol) and the withdrawal was so horrible i went back up to 100mg about 8 days of being on 50mg pristiq.

The second I dropped down to 50mg pristiq my BP and HR made the drop, and even after going back up on 100mg I still have a very low and normal blood pressure/heart rate

I know this is technically a good thing but I feel almost a little but off put because of such a drastic change. I am a caffeine addict and no matter how much coffee I drink it doesnt raise my vitals at all.

I know I need to stop drinking coffee and I really want to its just so hard‚Ä¶ anyways if anyone has any ideas lmk!

1lcictb,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1lcictb/hr_voice_in_the_woods/,[HR] Voice in the woods,"We live tucked deep in the Southern Appalachian mountains, in a holler no GPS will find and no outsider wants to stumble into after dark. The kind of place where the woods don‚Äôt end‚Äîthey swallow. There‚Äôs a hush to the land out here. The kind of quiet that doesn‚Äôt feel empty, just watchful.

It was just past midnight when it happened. A Thursday, I think. The air was still, heavy with the scent of moss and pine, the kind of thick silence that settles over everything once the cicadas burn out. The kids were asleep. My wife had gone to bed an hour earlier, and I stayed behind in the kitchen, sipping bad coffee and scrolling through nothing.

Then I heard her call my name‚Äîsharp, afraid.

I moved fast. That‚Äôs not how she calls unless something‚Äôs wrong. I bolted down the hall toward our bedroom‚Äîonly to find it empty. The covers pulled back, the lamp still on. My stomach dropped.

Out the window, I spotted her‚Äîsitting in our old Jeep, parked just beyond the porch light‚Äôs reach. The moon was bright enough to cast everything in silver, and I could see her clearly, wide-eyed, staring out across the yard toward the woods.

That‚Äôs when John ran.

He came tearing down the gravel drive barefoot, shirtless, wild-eyed. He didn‚Äôt even look at me. Just hit the treeline and vanished into the dark like something was chasing him, or like he was running straight into hell to avoid it.

Then I heard it.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

A child‚Äôs voice. Small. Lost. A little girl‚Äîno older than six. It floated out from the black edge of the woods, just beyond the first row of trees.

There was something about it‚Äîthe way it held my name without saying it. The way it cracked just a little at the end, like she was trying not to cry.

I called back, ‚ÄúHey! Who‚Äôs out there?‚Äù

The voice answered, same tone. Same softness.
‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt just an answer. It was an echo‚Äîbut not mine. It didn‚Äôt sound like something trying to be a kid. It sounded like something pretending. And doing it too well.

My wife hadn‚Äôt moved. Still frozen in the car, but now she was staring at me. I saw it in her face‚Äîthe shift. From fear to real fear. Whatever was in those woods, she felt it too.

I motioned her toward the house, and she moved fast. She left the car door open as she sprinted. The moment she passed me, I turned to follow.

That‚Äôs when it called again.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

Closer now. Same voice. Too close.

Every inch of my body tightened. My skin knew before my brain did: this wasn‚Äôt some lost child. This was a trap. Something trying to get close enough for something worse.

I broke into a sprint. Feet hitting the porch hard, the wood creaking under me. I slammed the front door shut and threw the deadbolt. My wife collapsed against the hallway wall, breathing fast. I didn‚Äôt ask questions‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt need to.

We both knew.

Silence. Then‚Äî

Scratch.
Low. Deliberate. A slow drag of nails‚Äînot fingertips‚Äîacross the wood just beneath the handle.

Then the voice again. Just on the other side.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

The scratching stopped.

No footsteps. No rustling. Just that brutal silence the mountains keep like a secret. You could‚Äôve heard a mouse shift in the walls‚Äîor your own heartbeat cracking in your ears.

We stood still. My wife slid down the wall and curled her knees to her chest. I placed one hand on the doorframe like I was holding it closed with more than just the lock. Truth was, I didn‚Äôt trust the bolt. Not with that voice out there.

Out here in the deep woods, you learn to respect what doesn‚Äôt make sense.

I checked the time. 1:03 a.m. That meant we had hours before dawn. Hours of shadow. Of not knowing. Of that thing waiting out there. Or worse‚Äîcircling.

‚ÄúShould we call someone?‚Äù she whispered.

Call who? The county sheriff lives forty minutes away. Cell signal‚Äôs a rumor this deep in the holler. Even if we got a bar, what do I say?
‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs scratching my door and pretending to be a lost little girl‚Äù?

She knew the answer already. She didn‚Äôt ask again.

I walked to the back window and peered through the blinds. The treeline lay still. The moon lit up the yard like frost, but past the first dozen trees, it was all ink. That kind of dark where your eyes never adjust. Like the woods weren‚Äôt empty‚Äîjust full of something that knew how to hold still.

And that voice‚Ä¶

It wasn‚Äôt gone. Not really. I could feel it, just past the light. Like someone watching you from a place they‚Äôve already memorized.

That‚Äôs the thing about these mountains: they know how to listen. They soak up sound. They let your screams die in the hollows and come back to you as whispers. They don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre scared.

I pulled the shotgun from above the fireplace. It was loaded. It wouldn‚Äôt help.

‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs gone,‚Äù my wife said. But she didn‚Äôt believe it. Her voice was just one more thing to keep the quiet from swallowing us.

I don‚Äôt know what time I fell asleep, but I remember the last thing I heard before I did.

A soft tap. Not a knock. Just a test. Like a finger running along glass.

From the kitchen window this time.

Then‚Äî

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù
They say the mountains have rules.

Old ones. Not written down, not spoken often. Just known. If you grow up in these woods‚Äîor stay long enough‚Äîyou learn to keep your porch light on, your curtains closed, and your door locked tight after sunset. You don‚Äôt whistle at night. You don‚Äôt call back when something calls your name. And above all, you don‚Äôt open the door.

We didn‚Äôt open the door.

But that thing didn‚Äôt leave.

The next few hours blurred into a long, breathless stretch of waiting. The tapping moved‚Äîsometimes on the front door, sometimes the windows. Sometimes it circled the house in long, dragging loops. I‚Äôd hear it at the kitchen glass‚Ä¶then five seconds later, at the back porch‚Ä¶then, nothing.

Then‚Äî

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

My wife clutched my hand tight whenever it came close. She didn‚Äôt ask what it was. She knew. It wasn‚Äôt a child. It wasn‚Äôt lost. It was inviting itself in.

At 2:27 a.m., it found the kids‚Äô window.

The first tap was light‚Äîlike a moth against the glass. Then another. Then three in a row. Rhythmic.

My daughter‚Äôs voice floated down the hall. ‚ÄúDaddy?‚Äù

I was already moving.

I slipped into the room. She and her younger brother sat up in bed, their eyes wide but calm. They didn‚Äôt cry. Didn‚Äôt scream. Mountain kids. They‚Äôd been raised to respect the dark.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs someone at the window,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúShe keeps saying hello.‚Äù

I looked. The curtains were drawn. But I felt it. Right there, on the other side.

I motioned them out of the room silently, guiding them to the couch in the living room where my wife had pulled blankets and cushions into a quiet nest.

We didn‚Äôt speak. Not because we were afraid to‚Äîbut because it was listening.

For the next hour, it danced around the house. The voice would disappear, and in its place‚Äîsilence so loud you could feel it vibrating inside your chest. The kind of quiet that doesn't bring peace. The kind that tells you something's thinking.

Then, around 4:00 a.m., it changed.

No more tapping.

No more ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

Just a thump. A weight. Something leaning against the front door.

Then‚Äî

‚ÄúJoe.‚Äù

The voice didn‚Äôt belong to a child anymore.

It was John.

‚ÄúJoe‚Äîman, it‚Äôs me. Please. I didn‚Äôt know where else to go.‚Äù
His voice cracked like a branch splitting under pressure. ‚ÄúPlease open the door.‚Äù

My hands went numb.

He said my name again. And again. Always with the same rhythm. Same crack. Same tone.

‚ÄúPlease. Please open the door.‚Äù

I stared at the deadbolt.

My wife sat upright, her hand trembling now. She shook her head, just once. Hard.

I met this girl through friends. It was a real raw spark.. We started bonding and casually planned for things later. There's a quick rapport with a mix of jokes, shared interests, lifestyle choices, and spontaneous humor, all blended in, all of which mix and go at a fast pace, making it wholesome and great.

As time progressed, the dialogue turned flirtatious. And explored personal boundaries, some sexual fantasies and even sensitive topics like kinks. (I'm trying to resume something so emotionally dense in few words that can't explain the connection).

So after waiting for a convenient time to visit each other (we live far from each other) It was due! to start our dating phase! with a first one, that seemed to go well, from planning a coffee and a walk, to hanging out for 6 hours & her wanting me to stay the whole night in her city.

Yet, the one thing that got me off guard, she unexpectedly she introduced me to her sister without prior notice before the date. I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with meeting family that early, so at the end of the date, I jokingly said, ‚ÄúI'll meet you in another city where your sister won't be around.‚Äù

Yet, as it simmered through next day, things backfired. I tried reaching out several times & got hard-walled. Got consufed. Got ghosted me for a month. Eventually, I spoke to a common friend who told me she took what I said as a very rude saying, and took it as I was only interested in her for sex & hooking up and didn‚Äôt care about her at all.

When I heard that, I tried to apologize, I felt guilty, but her response was, ‚ÄúWhat you said was horrible. I rarely see my family, ofc they are my priority. I completely lost interest.‚Äù she got so guarded and my friend told me that she was mad 10/10 on scale, and said ‚ÄúThat was a date, the only date"" + ""I absolutely didn‚Äôt give a f\*ck about him, that the next day, I went on another date with another guy and I don‚Äôt give a single shit about him that he doesn‚Äôt even cross my mind.‚Äù

It sounds to me like someone mad and disgusted by who I was in their mind, rathen than indifferent. I tried again to express that I still cared, even if it was a short time we knew each other. But after that, she blocked me on 2 social medias that I tried to reach on (2 are open). Now the situation seems dead. I know.

But, I fucking.. can't.. get her.. off my mind.. 3rd month in right now.

The potential is so great that I just wanted to be raw on everything, be truthful rather than ""put my attitude with makeup on"", I didn't mean to offend, just to express a boundary in a playful way to keep it low.

WHAT CAN I DO, I feel so trapped in this.. If I visit her city, shall I try to send a message to just speak things out? Shall I give up? Shall I let time fix things if she felt exposed by my words?? Shall I ask our common friend if my name still triggers her??? What can I do????

PS: she's very attached to her sister, long context, but she got only her sister & mother in her life.",3,1750043089.0,heartbreak,1,1.0,False

I have a variety of interests and hobbies, but I am so familiar with all of them that none of it brings a spark to my life anymore. When I‚Äôm at home, I find myself doing the same things that I have been doing since I was a teenager. I watch videos on things that interest me both educational and entertainment, I watch movies or shows that used to bring me joy. Video games sometimes do bring me an intense increase in excitement  when I find a new game to play, but then I end up overplaying it to where that excitement completely dies off and I don‚Äôt play it again.

I drink tea and coffee and go to cafes, I have many creative outlets that I actively do like drawing, writing, painting. I have a collection of plants outside that I tend to and garden that I plant flowers in. I used to spend a decent amount of time on social media and while that kept me occupied I‚Äôve decided ultimately it brought me no actual value to my life and I‚Äôve deleted all my social media off my phone so my consumption is way down. I try cooking and baking but I am really not good at it and I don‚Äôt find joy in it. I used to like watching things like movies and shows and videos but now it seems like I‚Äôve done it so often throughout my life that it‚Äôs so accessible that I don‚Äôt even want to watch things anymore even if they‚Äôre new. I read books and do sudoku puzzles but they don‚Äôt bring me ‚Äòexcitement‚Äô. 

Ultimately, there‚Äôs so many things that I *could* do, but none of them make me feel actual joy or excitement anymore. The spark is completely gone. I go for walks and listen to music, I workout as well, I try journaling and planning things for my life in a healthy way. I am just questioning to myself, is this it? Is this all there is? I‚Äôve done this for almost a decade. What‚Äôs next? More and more years of the same routine? I am grateful that I am able to do these things and even question this part of life, but also it‚Äôs not a somewhere that I want to be. I want to be able to do all these things again if it made me feel something.

I know probably the next steps would be talking with people and feeling connected with those around me. Well, I wish I could, but unfortunately that‚Äôs not really the life I was given nor do I have the skills to do so. I‚Äôm estranged from my family. I have one friend that‚Äôs been in my life for years and I‚Äôm glad I have her, she‚Äôs a great person, but I don‚Äôt feel that we are very close emotionally. We hangout and I like spending time with her but I don‚Äôt feel I can be truly myself around her, and I feel like our time is transactional, both of us are the type of people to be like ‚ÄòOh look at the time, it‚Äôs 6 pm well I better get home to make dinner and take it easy‚Äô. And honestly, I am such a socially anxious person that even when I do have some chance for a ‚Äòwild night out‚Äô I just feel incomplete when I‚Äôm in the moment. It feels like a mask that‚Äôs on me and it‚Äôs not the real me having fun, just me acting like I‚Äôm having fun. It‚Äôs hard for me to find and make friends, especially today when so many people are homebodies (even me). I know I‚Äôm being hypocritical but I feel stuck in a cursed loop.

I would really love to travel, but modern day is difficult to find time and money for leisure, and someone else to find that time and money at the same time as well. I‚Äôve gone traveling alone convinced nothing could stop me, and each time it was very strange, like I had no one to share these experiences with so it felt lonely.

I don‚Äôt mean to sound so pessimistic, I‚Äôm normally not a pessimistic person. I just keep catching myself in this state of not actually feeling something anymore, especially at nighttime when I have hours of time to do something anything and I end up not having a want to do any because I‚Äôm not excited to. All these hobbies and interests I have, and all these little things I do haven‚Äôt been able to bring it back. Any tips? Thanks.

Next step is EBRT, VMAT 16 sessions, 2.5Gy per fraction. I did the CT simulation about a week ago, they had me do an enema in the morning 2 hours beforehand and then drink 24oz of water 45 minutes before my appointment.

When I got to the appointment they said there was still fecal matter in my rectum and my bladder wasn‚Äôt full enough, had me put on a penile clamp and go push out as much poop as I could while holding the pee in using the clamp. It was fairly uncomfortable and I‚Äôd rather not repeat this experience. I pooped a little more and they said I was good to go for the sim.

So last week I started practicing my poop/pee schedule in the morning based on my radiation appointment times at 8:30AM. The problem is that I cant for the life of me seem to go poop by the time I need to, my body just will not cooperate. The things I would do to alleviate this normally would be to drink some more water or some coffee, neither of which I can do in this specific situation.

My actual radiation sessions start on Tuesday morning and I‚Äôm terrified that I‚Äôm not going to be able to get this rhythm to work.

[$300 budget],"**BLUF:** Total beginner upgrading from a $50 machine + pre-ground coffee setup. Is buying a $200 J-Ultra and fresh beans the best first step? I like classic, full-bodied, earthy espresso. Any tips or advice?  
  
Hi r/espresso,

I never thought I'd get this deep into this world, but after having some insanely good espresso, I'm hooked and really wanna learn. I'm a complete beginner looking for guidance before I start bankrupting myself.

This is my current setup

* Bella Pro Series espresso machine (\~$50)
* Pre-ground Cafe Bustelo (lol)
* Basic tamper and needle distributor

I recently learned the single biggest upgrade I can make is using freshly roasted beans and grinding them right before brewing.

I want to get the 1Zpresso J-Ultra manual grinder ($200) and find quality freshly roasted beans (suggestions welcomed as well). My research suggests the conical burrs in the J-Ultra are great for the full-bodied, creamy, and rich flavors I love, as opposed to a brighter, more acidic taste from flat burrs.

I love that deep, earthy taste. I'm looking for classic, traditional espresso flavors. I definitely don't want beans with artificial flavors. At least I don't think, I honestly don't know what I don't know. But I'm not too big on sweet coffee, I prefer black coffee (if that helps).

* Is focusing on a quality grinder like the J-Ultra the right first move, even with my very basic machine?
* Is the J-Ultra reliable and worth the money?
* What else should I know that I don't know I don't know?

I can afford to invest in decent equipment and I don't mind the workflow of manual grinding. I understand my machine is the next bottleneck, but everyone says ""grinder first."" I just want to make sure I'm starting off on the right foot.

We have a two year old girl who is awesome and great kid. We have a good marriage but when it comes to holidays I feel it‚Äôs lopsided. I always try to think of things outside the box and go above beyond for her when it comes to birthdays and Mother‚Äôs Day. I want to show my appreciation for how much she does. However for me it seems like a lack of effort,for example this Mother‚Äôs Day I completed a bathroom refresh(what she wanted) using my money. I gifted her a hand created drawing of her and our daughter and gift card to her favorite store. I got up early and let her sleep in, ran out to Starbucks for her(I don‚Äôt like coffee) I let her relax all day and took care of all of our toddlers needs so she didn‚Äôt have to lift a finger. I truly wanted her to relax. That night I bathed and put our daughter to bed (not unusual for me to do, we split these duties very often but wanted to make sure she could sit and lounge as it‚Äôs her day) once bed time was completed I made steak, asparagus, and baked potato. I served her dinner and we just watched a movie and relaxed till bed.

Today(Father‚Äôs Day) i get up with the family as normal no sleeping in, I get a few gifs in a target bag because she forgot to get gift bag( not a big deal but she always ensure she has one for everyone) forgot about another small gift until I found a box and asked what it was. my mother-in-law was invited over (not my choice) and comes over for 3 hours, then leaves right before nap time. Once my daughter wakes up we head over to my parents for a few hours, we get home and get our daughter ready for dinner/bath/bed. My wife did majority of it but after bed time, no dinner, no nothing we end up eating cereal and starting a show. 

Am I being ungrateful for the gifts? Am I the asshole for feeling like she didn‚Äôt really care? Do I feel this way because maybe I am not doing as much as I thought so she doesn‚Äôt actually appreciate me and I should change?",1,1750041591.0,AmIOverreacting,0,0.67,False

Let me be upfront: I‚Äôm not rich. I‚Äôm not tall (5'6""). I live with my parents (I‚Äôm an only child, and they‚Äôre pretty elderly and require constant care) while also rebuilding after years of mental health struggles, career instability, and loss. I‚Äôve also taken up a side gig as my friend‚Äôs personal driver (she‚Äôs a high-level flight attendant who doesn‚Äôt drive). I‚Äôve been through some heavy things, and I‚Äôm still working through them. I don‚Äôt have a long dating history. I‚Äôve never had that sweeping, mutual love I always believed I‚Äôd find. But I‚Äôm still here. Still trying. Still hoping.

I‚Äôve been a musician since I was 16, teaching myself guitar and making beats on pirated software back in the early 2000s. Now I help run a small indie label with a friend. Over the past five years, I‚Äôve released three albums with my current project, where I wrote, sang, and played nearly everything. One of my songs was featured in a short film at the 2022 Tacoma Film Festival. And when I was 18, a project of mine hit the front page of YouTube. (Nothing came of it, but hey, it happened.)

I‚Äôm an artist, a writer, a dreamer. I feel things deeply, probably too deeply. I care. I overthink. I love David Lynch films, My Bloody Valentine B-sides, late-night conversations, coffee shops, libraries, compact 35mm cameras, guitars, colognes/fragrances (Bleu De Chanel is my go-to but I never skip the chance to try out stuff I haven't smelled before), Square Enix games, Korean BBQ, diners, cats (I have 2, Max & Boris), and intense music of literally any genre that makes your heart swell. Playlists are sacred. I live about 45 minutes from North Bend, WA (where a lot of Twin Peaks was filmed), and it‚Äôs my favorite place in the world. I don‚Äôt drink (just weed for me, thanks) and I have a deep respect and reverence for psychedelic mushrooms. (Google Maria Sabina.)

I think a lot about healing ‚Äî how to soften instead of harden, how to stay open in a world that keeps asking us to shut down. I try to meet life (and people) with curiosity and compassion, even when it‚Äôs hard.

Physically, aside from my height, I have long dark hair and blue eyes. I usually get described as ‚Äúcute‚Äù more than ‚Äúhot‚Äù or ‚Äúhandsome‚Äù (much to my chagrin). I‚Äôm not especially big, but I‚Äôve put time into the gym and even worked at Planet Fitness for a bit (which is... narratively funny if nothing else). I try to dress with intention: think goth clubs, secondhand leather jackets, Nicolas Cage in Wild At Heart. I do my best to carry a vibe.

I‚Äôm not perfect, but I‚Äôm real. And I‚Äôm looking for someone real too: someone kind, open, emotionally present. Someone who values tenderness over polish. Someone who might also be wondering if there‚Äôs still time to find their person.

If that‚Äôs you, I‚Äôd love to hear from you. Tell me your favorite band. Tell me what makes you feel safe. Tell me what you miss.

I can share photos and the usual social media stuff, but I‚Äôd really prefer to use Discord (I used to play a lot of Final Fantasy XIV, and it just kind of stuck). Please don‚Äôt make me suffer through Reddit‚Äôs godforsaken internal messaging system for too long. I‚Äôve left a lot out, but if anything here speaks to you, I‚Äôd be honored to talk.",1,1750041482.0,r4r,1,0.67,False

1lchsmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1lchsmc/i_noticed_something_today/,I noticed something today,"I spent a decent part of my afternoon killing time after an unexpected shift in dinner plans. I, being a daughter mostly disconnected from her father nowadays, had procrastinated in avoidance of 
 the event and thought I might feel shameful if I didn‚Äôt at least turn up with a card. There are many pleasures in life, of the innumerable is any opportunity to order an iced coffee beverage of your choice and walk around the grocery store. 

While walking into the store I found my new shoes didn‚Äôt fit well, slipping from the heel on one foot. My gait would be awkwardly strained if I moved too briskly. I stride smoothly and carefully to order my coffee. Beverage in hand, I find myself in an aisle behind an older woman, perhaps in her 60s who was moving at a leisurely pace not conducive to my freshly caffeinated power walk. I felt immediate shame as I rounded past her, occasionally halfway losing a shoe, struggling to move past her in the traffic. 

Feeling humbled, I arrived in the card aisle and pointed my eye towards the picked through, mostly empty section dedicated on a rotating basis to Father‚Äôs Day. Feeling apathetic towards my relationship with this figure I wanted to be sure not to select a card that lays the gravy on particularly thick, not wanting him to take this card as some sign of reunification. After darting and later slowly dragging my eyes across the rows of colorful cards I had a disruptive realization; all the cards left are meant for exceptionally great fathers. 

Standing there wondering if I should just go to a different store to find a card the same woman I passed earlier is suddenly standing next to me. She smiled softly, I smiled back while suppressing the shame of my earlier haste. She joked that the picked through shelves were a just reward for daughters who waited so long. We agreed all the good ones must have been long gone. I stifled the impulse to say ‚Äúit‚Äôs easier if you don‚Äôt like your father.‚Äù I hope she has a good relationship with her father.

## Key Features Analysis

A truly effective teacher survival kit isn‚Äôt just a collection of random items; it‚Äôs a carefully curated selection designed to address the specific needs of educators. Here's a breakdown of key features to consider when building or buying a kit:

**Hydration Hero:** A High-Quality Water Bottle.

staying hydrated is crucial for maintaining energy levels and overall well-being, something that's often overlooked amidst the classroom chaos. A durable, insulated water bottle that keeps drinks cold (or hot) for extended periods is essential. Look for options made from stainless steel, featuring leak-proof lids, and easy-to-clean designs. A capacity of at least 24 ounces is recommended for a full day of teaching.

**Caffeine Kickstart:** A Reliable Source of Energy.Whether it‚Äôs coffee, tea, or energy bars, having a go-to source of energy is a must for battling afternoon slumps. Consider including single-serve coffee pods, individually wrapped tea bags, or a selection of healthy granola bars and protein bites. Opt for options with low sugar content to avoid the dreaded sugar crash. Variety is key to cater to different preferences and dietary needs.

**Organization Oasis:** A Compact Planner or Notebook.

Staying organized is paramount for managing lesson plans, deadlines, and student information.A compact planner or notebook with a durable cover and clear layout can make all the difference. Look for options with monthly and weekly spreads, ample space for notes, and perhaps even sections for student contact information or grading. Digital planners are also a grate option for tech-savvy teachers.

**Sanity Saver:** A Mini Relaxation Station.

Teaching can be incredibly stressful, so incorporating items that promote relaxation and stress relief is crucial. consider including aromatherapy oils (like lavender or peppermint), a stress ball, a calming coloring book with colored pencils, or a small collection of inspiring quotes. These items provide a much-needed mental break during busy school days.

## Core Benefits

A well-thought-out teacher survival kit offers a multitude of benefits that extend beyond mere convenience. It directly impacts a teacher's well-being, productivity, and overall effectiveness in the classroom.**Reduced Stress and Anxiety:** Having essential items readily available eliminates the stress of scrambling for necessities during the workday. Knowing that solutions for common problems are at hand provides a sense of control and reduces anxiety.For example, having pain relievers for unexpected headaches or a change of clothes for spills eliminates small moments of panic during a chaotic day.

**Improved Time Management:** A kit stocked with organizational tools and readily accessible supplies saves valuable time. Instead of searching for a pen, tape, or stapler, these items are readily available, allowing teachers to focus on more important tasks like lesson planning and student interaction. This efficiency contributes to a more streamlined and productive workday.

**Enhanced Self-Care:** Including items that promote relaxation and well-being encourages teachers to prioritize self-care, even during busy school days. Taking a few minutes for aromatherapy or stress relief exercises can considerably improve mood and reduce burnout.These small acts of self-care can have a profound impact on overall mental and physical health.

**Increased Preparedness:** A comprehensive survival kit ensures that teachers are prepared for a wide range of unforeseen circumstances, from minor emergencies to unexpected challenges. Having items like first-aid supplies, spare snacks, and dialog tools readily available can make a significant difference in handling unexpected situations with confidence and competence.

**Boosted Morale and Confidence:** Knowing that you are well-prepared and have the necessary tools to handle your day-to-day challenges boosts confidence and morale. Showing that you've taken the time to assemble a comprehensive kit sends a message that you're invested in your well-being and dedicated to your profession. This can make a significant difference in job satisfaction and overall sense of purpose.

## Ideal User Profile

A teacher survival kit is not a one-size-fits-all solution; its effectiveness depends largely on the individual needs and preferences of the user. Here are some specific user profiles who would benefit the most from a well-stocked kit:

A survival kit can definitely help a substitute teacher prepare for a wide variety of scenarios in schools that they may not have attended before.

**Teachers with Long commutes.** Having resources available when traveling is crucial. These teachers can benefit from a kit including roadside emergency supplies, entertainment (book, audio book), and a portable electronic device charger.

1lchmcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1lchmcm/is_it_normal_to_be_unemployed_a_month_after/,Is it normal to be unemployed a month after graduation from college?,"Hey everyone,

I graduated a little over a month ago with a Bachelor's in Applied Arts and Sciences, with concentrations in Cybersecurity, Cybercrime, and General Business. Since then, I‚Äôve been actively job hunting, mainly focusing on entry-level roles in cybersecurity.

So far, I‚Äôve applied to 30+ jobs through platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, Zip Recuiter and Handshake. I put effort into every applicatio. My resume and cover letters are tailored, and after applying, I usually cold email recruiters. I try to highlight my accomplishments, connect with the company‚Äôs values, mention something unique about their cybersecurity work, and kindly ask if they‚Äôd be open to a virtual coffee chat.

Out of all of that, only one recruiter responded and actually took time to give me valuable feedback. Aside from that, I‚Äôve gotten 11 rejection emails, 2 canceled roles, and a lot of applications just sitting in the void. I‚Äôve started filtering job listings by the past 24 hours so I can apply early, but still no interviews yet.

I‚Äôm starting to feel a bit lost and discouraged. I‚Äôm doing everything I can think of, but I‚Äôm wondering is this just how it goes when you‚Äôre starting out, or is there something I should be doing differently?

Would really appreciate any advice, encouragement, or even just hearing from people in the same boat.

Thanks in advance.
