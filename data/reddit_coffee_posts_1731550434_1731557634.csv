According to Statista, the global upcycled products market has been on a steady rise, with consumer interest up by 15% year-over-year. Not only is upcycling a way to personalize home décor, but it also helps reduce waste and give old items new life.

**Section 1: What is Upcycling, and Why is it Important?**

Upcycling, unlike recycling, transforms discarded items into new, more valuable products without breaking them down. This process is environmentally friendly, minimizes waste, and encourages creativity by challenging individuals to think outside the box.

**Environmental Impact**

A recent study by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revealed that landfills in the United States alone contain 10.5 million tons of furniture waste annually. Upcycling can significantly reduce these numbers by diverting waste from landfills, conserving resources, and reducing pollution.

* **Fact Box**: In 2022, Statista reported that 34% of American consumers were willing to pay more for eco-friendly or sustainable products, indicating a growing trend toward sustainable practices.

**Section 2: Benefits of Upcycling in Home Décor**

Upcycling offers multiple benefits for home décor enthusiasts:

1. **Cost-Effective**: By repurposing existing items, you save money on buying new décor.
2. **Unique Style**: Upcycling allows for one-of-a-kind pieces that reflect personal taste.
3. **Sustainability**: Reducing waste helps the environment, and upcycled items often require fewer resources than new products.
4. **Creativity**: Upcycling encourages experimentation and offers a creative outlet for personal expression.

**Section 3: Getting Started with Upcycling – Tips and Tools**

Before you dive into upcycling, gathering a few basic tools and supplies can make projects easier. A toolkit with essentials like a hot glue gun, scissors, paintbrushes, sandpaper, and adhesives will be beneficial. Start with smaller projects and gradually expand as you become comfortable with the process.

* **Pro Tip**: Shopping at thrift stores, flea markets, or garage sales is a great way to find inexpensive items for upcycling projects.

**Section 4: Creative Upcycling Ideas for Every Room**

Below are creative upcycling projects for various rooms, each designed to transform common items into stylish décor.

**Living Room**

1. **Wine Bottle Candle Holders**
   * Wine bottles can be cut, painted, or decorated to serve as unique candle holders or even flower vases. Using a glass cutter, you can slice the bottle, smooth the edges, and add tealight candles or fairy lights for a cozy ambiance.
2. **Old Ladder as Bookshelf**
   * Transform an old wooden ladder into a rustic bookshelf by sanding, painting, and placing it against a wall. This offers a unique way to display books, plants, or small trinkets, adding charm to any living space.
3. **Wooden Pallet Coffee Table**
   * Wooden pallets are easy to find and can be repurposed into a chic coffee table. With a coat of paint, some wheels for mobility, and a glass top, pallets make for sturdy, eco-friendly furniture pieces.

**Kitchen**

1. **Tin Can Utensil Holders**
   * Used tin cans can be upcycled into chic utensil holders. Paint them in your preferred colors, add decorative labels, and line them along the kitchen counter for a vintage-inspired look.
2. **Drawer to Spice Rack**
   * An old drawer can easily be transformed into a spice rack. Simply add shelves or separators within the drawer, mount it on the wall, and organize spices neatly for easy access.
3. **Cutlery Chandelier**
   * Old cutlery can be used to create a quirky chandelier by attaching spoons, forks, and knives to a circular frame. This is a great way to repurpose mismatched utensils while adding personality to your kitchen.

**Bedroom**

1. **Suitcase Side Table**
   * Vintage suitcases make for fantastic side tables. Simply stack them on top of each other, or place them on a stand for a retro feel. You can also open one up to use as storage for books or other items.
2. **T-Shirt Quilts**
   * If you have old t-shirts that hold sentimental value, consider turning them into a quilt. This upcycling project is not only functional but also serves as a wonderful way to preserve memories.
3. **Mirror Frame from Broken Jewelry**
   * Broken pieces of jewelry can be repurposed as decorative frames for mirrors. Attach them around the edge of a mirror to create a stunning, bohemian-style piece for the bedroom.

**Bathroom**

1. **Glass Jar Storage**
   * Repurpose [glass jars for storage](https://www.truegether.com/category/arts-crafts) by mounting them onto a wooden board to hold items like cotton balls, makeup brushes, or toothbrushes. This idea combines functionality with rustic charm.
2. **Towel Holder from Old Belts**
   * Use old leather belts to create a stylish towel holder. Attach them to the wall in loops, and slide rolled towels through for a unique storage solution that adds character to your bathroom.
3. **Mason Jar Soap Dispenser**
   * A mason jar can be turned into a soap dispenser by adding a pump mechanism. Paint the jar or leave it clear for a classic look, and you’ll have a charming, functional addition to the bathroom.

**Garden or Outdoor Area**

1. **Tire Planters**
   * Old tires can be painted and used as planters for flowers or small shrubs. Stack tires to create a raised bed effect or hang them for a vertical garden display.
2. **Plastic Bottle Hanging Garden**
   * Empty plastic bottles can be repurposed as planters for herbs or small plants. Cut the bottles, decorate, and hang them vertically to save space and create an eco-friendly garden.
3. **Chair Planter**
   * An old chair with a broken seat can be converted into a planter. Place a pot where the seat used to be and paint the chair for a pop of color in your garden.

**Section 5: Upcycling Trends in 2024**

The demand for sustainable home décor continues to grow, and upcycling has emerged as a favorite trend. As reported by Statista, the DIY décor market, which includes upcycling, is projected to grow by 5.5% annually. More people are seeking ways to reduce their carbon footprint and live sustainably.

* **Mixed Materials**: Combining metal, wood, and glass in upcycled items is trendy, creating a blend of rustic and industrial aesthetics.
* **Minimalism with a Personal Touch**: Upcycling allows for creating personalized, minimalist décor that reflects individual tastes without excess waste.
* **Eco-Friendly Paints and Finishes**: People are increasingly using eco-friendly paints and varnishes, which are safe for the environment and give upcycled pieces a polished look.

**Section 6: How Upcycling Impacts the Environment**

In addition to its aesthetic and cost-saving benefits, upcycling also has significant environmental advantages.

* **Reduction in Waste**: Upcycling reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills, conserving natural resources.
* **Lower Carbon Footprint**: Repurposing items requires fewer resources than recycling or manufacturing new products, leading to a smaller carbon footprint.

**Statistic Highlight**

According to a report by the EPA, upcycling could reduce landfill waste by up to 50% in some categories of household items if adopted widely. This means that individual efforts at upcycling could have a profound environmental impact.

**Section 7: Essential Tips for Successful Upcycling**

To get the most out of your upcycling projects, consider these tips:

1. **Start Small**: Begin with simple projects like repurposing jars or making candle holders. As you gain confidence, move on to larger items.
2. **Use Non-Toxic Materials**: Choose environmentally-friendly paints, adhesives, and finishes, especially for items used indoors.
3. **Personalize**: Add a touch of your own style through colors, textures, or embellishments.
4. **Consider Functionality**: Upcycled items should not only look good but also serve a purpose. Functionality adds long-term value to your efforts.

**Conclusion**

Upcycling and repurposing everyday items into creative home décor is a rewarding way to personalize your space, save money, and contribute to environmental sustainability. As this guide has shown, with a bit of creativity and a few tools, you can turn almost anything into a stylish addition to your home. Upcycling is more than just a trend—it’s a way to make conscious choices that benefit both you and the planet. So, start exploring your home for items to repurpose and transform your space with unique, meaningful décor.

I’m in a bit of a dilemma and could use some advice.

So I work remotely, but at a recent office retreat, I met this coworker I’d only known over Zoom before. The first time I saw her, she was in a saree, and honestly, it took me a solid 10 seconds just to say ""hello""—she completely caught me off guard. Before this, we’d bonded a bit over work calls, even complaining together about certain things. We get each other in a way.

Since then, we’ve stayed in touch a lot. We’ve even gone out a couple of times for coffee and hung out once at a party at our manager's place. Lately, we’ve started sending each other cute reels, and if I don’t react to one, she actually gets a bit annoyed, which is... confusing but also kinda nice.

Here's the issue: she’s single but heartbroken from a tough breakup, and I’m a divorcee, which she knows. Both of us have our own messy stories, and I feel like she’s still processing hers. But there’s this connection that I can’t ignore. I don’t want to ruin the friendship or make work awkward, but I also don’t want to miss a chance at something more.

Right after drinking a cup I could tell it wasn't decaf and felt all jittery for hours especially since I haven't had any in almost a year. Turns out it was a prank some guys played because "" I'm so high energy"" they wanted to see what I was like cafinated. A couple nights later I was at the store and I saw there was a sale on decaf so I bought a bunch took it to work and dumped out all the regular coffee and filled the canister with decaf . 

No one has caught on yet but they are definitely dragging ass lately in the mornings. I feel it's fair game but my wife says that messing with their performance isn't cool especially long term ( because it will be at least a month or so before they finish the canister) and it's our busy season at work.

1gqwcpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentRentalInvestor/comments/1gqwcpy/finding_the_perfect_location_for_student_rentals/,Finding the Perfect Location for Student Rentals – Here’s How I Do It,"If you’ve ever wondered why some student rentals are always fully occupied while others just down the street struggle to get tenants, you’re not alone. I learned this lesson the hard way when I was in college myself. The right location can be the difference between a cash flow machine and a property that sits vacant.

In this post, I’ll break down exactly how to find the *perfect location* for student rentals, using the same strategies that helped me build a $5 million portfolio. Whether you're just starting or looking to optimize your current investments, this guide is for you.

# 1. My College Epiphany: Location, Location, Location

When I was a college student myself, I struggled to find a place close to campus. I noticed that the houses right next to the university were always in *high demand* and rented at sky-high prices, even if they weren’t in the best condition. But just a few blocks away, similar properties were renting for significantly less and often had vacancies.

That’s when it hit me: **proximity to campus** was a goldmine. If I could own properties in those high-demand spots, I’d have a steady stream of tenants year after year. This insight became the foundation of my strategy to invest in student rentals.

# 2. The 5 Factors That Make a Perfect Student Rental Location

Not all “close to campus” locations are created equal. Here’s a breakdown of what I look for:

**A) Walking Distance to Campus**:

* **Ideal range**: 0.5 to 1 mile from campus. Students prefer places they can walk or bike to in 10-15 minutes.
* Check Google Maps to estimate walking times. Look for properties on direct walking routes to campus.

**B) Access to Amenities**:

* Students want convenience. Look for areas with **grocery stores, coffee shops, fast-food spots, gyms, and public transport**.
* Properties within a 5-minute walk to essentials tend to rent out faster.

**C) Safety & Lighting**:

* Students (and their parents) care about safety. Check local crime maps and ensure the area is well-lit at night.
* I’ve found that properties near **campus police patrol routes** or with plenty of streetlights are much more attractive to tenants.

**D) Noise Levels**:

* This might sound odd, but students don’t want to live *right* next to the loudest party spots if they actually want to focus on their studies. Look for areas that are **close to campus but not directly in party central**.

**E) Public Transportation & Parking**:

* If your target school is in a city, being close to a bus stop or train station is a huge plus. Students without cars will appreciate this.
* For suburban campuses, make sure you have **ample parking** available. Lack of parking can be a deal-breaker.

# 3. How to Research and Validate the Location

Once you’ve identified a potential area, it’s time to do some due diligence. Here’s how to dig deeper:

**A) Online Research Tools**:

* Use sites like **Walk Score** and **Neighborhood Scout** to get a feel for walkability, safety, and amenities.
* Look at **Google Reviews** for local businesses to gauge the vibe of the neighborhood. Students love areas with highly-rated cafes, gyms, and hangout spots.

**B) Check University Resources**:

* Visit the university’s website or housing office to see if they list popular off-campus housing areas. This can give you insights into where students actually want to live.
* Check forums, Facebook groups, or Reddit communities where students discuss housing options.

**C) Talk to Local Realtors & Property Managers**:

* A good realtor who specializes in student rentals can be a goldmine of information. They know which areas have the highest demand and which streets to avoid.
* Property managers can also tell you which locations have lower vacancy rates.

**D) Boots on the Ground**:

* If possible, **walk or drive around the neighborhood** during different times of the day. Visit during the morning, afternoon, and evening to get a sense of traffic, noise, and safety.
* Talk to students if you see them around – ask them where they live and what they like or don’t like about their area.

# 4. Red Flags to Avoid When Choosing a Location

Not all locations near a university are good investments. Here are some red flags to watch out for:

* **Too close to party hotspots**: While it might seem like a great idea, being too close to bars and clubs can attract the wrong type of tenants and lead to higher turnover and property damage.
* **High crime rates**: Even if it’s cheap, avoid areas with high crime. You’ll struggle to fill rooms, and parents will steer their kids away.
* **Oversaturated markets**: If you see too many “For Rent” signs, it could be a sign of oversupply. Do some research to see if new student housing developments are being built nearby, which can reduce demand for your property.

# 5. Real-Life Example: How I Found the Perfect Property in Hamilton, Ontario

I’ll share how I applied these strategies to find one of my highest-performing student rentals.

* **Step 1**: I researched Hamilton’s student housing market and realized that properties close to McMaster University and Mohawk College were in high demand.
* **Step 2**: I used Google Maps to identify neighborhoods within a 10-minute walk to campus that also had access to grocery stores and cafes.
* **Step 3**: I drove through the area on a weekend to check noise levels and safety. I even chatted with a couple of students about where they lived and why they liked it.
* **Step 4**: I found a single-family home with a basement unit just 0.7 miles from campus. After some light renovations, I was able to rent it out by the room, significantly increasing the cash flow.

# 6. Your Next Steps – Finding Your First Student Rental Location

Now that you know what to look for, it’s time to start applying these strategies. Here’s a quick action plan:

1. **Pick a university** you’re interested in targeting.
2. **Research neighborhoods** using Google Maps, Walk Score, and forums.
3. **Talk to local realtors or property managers** to validate your choices.
4. Visit the area in person if possible and trust your gut.

Just felt the need to vent to someone after the 4th night in a row with sub 4 hrs of sleep. I am experiencing hallucinations and have lost all touch with reality. Nothing makes sense or is clear to me anymore, all I hear is the ringing sound in my ears. When someone talks to me, ringing. When I listen to music, ringing. When I go to bed, ringing. I can't enjoy any of my hobbies or concentrate on anything anymore. I have to write down what I'm going to do in the day step by step or save them on my phone since my memory is essentially gone, concentrating hurts. Life just feels like I am on a torture wheel, it is worse when nighttime comes. I vaguely recall a past when I used to be happy, and excited to go to concerts, bars, talk to my family and girlfriend. I was interested in my university studies and eager to work. I had goals and ambitions. Now I have lost connection to all of them. Not that they're not there anymore, but I am just a shell of who I once was. There is no me anymore. I live in a city where I no longer need a car for transport, and walk everywhere. Sold basically everything I liked. Had a nice motorcycle too. Shame. 

Tried the sound masking apps, melatonin, magnesium. Nothing works for me. I drink coffee like water, and gained weight. I used to be fit too you know. Now I walk around with dark circles under my eyes, people must think I'm a zombie, because I am. My life is no longer my own, yet I keep going forwards. Hoping one day there will be an end to this madness. One day.


There is no sleep either. I cry myself to bed most every night, I don't really know why, but I just do. I don't take any medication since I don't want nightmares too. Life alone is enough. ",1,1731557024.0,tinnitus,0,1.0,False

Granted that's not saying much considering the station employs a total of three men. But today really got to me.

It started when I arrived in the morning. A and B were standing around the coffee pot like normal and chatting. Somehow they got on the topic of paternity leave. They both thought it was a stupid concept. B joked about only taking three days off when his wife gave birth to their 2nd. A chimed in saying that he left his wife at home with their toddler and newborn when she got home from the hospital to catch up on some work... and they both found it so very funny.

Later when A was showing me something on one of the computers T showed up. I did not fully grasp why the others have issues with him until today. Me and T made polite conversation and I did my work until our weekly takeout feast from the place next door. Food and conversation are flowing normally until me and A start talking about a Thai restaurant in town. I mention that my boyfriend's parents, who are from that region of the world, make a special ""white people plate"" when I come over and that it's still too spicy for me. 

T then flies in with some racist nonsense about how they all eat cats and dogs and the spice is there to cover up the taste. You know, typical lowbrow racism. He then went on to complain about his crypto not doing well and how ""it's the currency of the future"" or whatever. I excused myself from lunch right after that and went into one of the recording booths to finish what I was working on. 

It really drains me when I'm around those men who are all between 45-65 and I just kind of have to take it. A is the only one who deems me competent enough to complete menial tasks. I don't think the others even trust me around a screwdriver. I've been there since late August and I'll be done by December. But good lord I need to be around intelligent women.

That being said, I’m looking for flavors to try.  I’ve tried 18 flavors already since my machine came with 12 to try, and I’ve bought or sampled the remaining 6 (whether they were samples at one of the boutiques or a bonus in an order through the app).

Additionally, when I was at a Nespresso Boutique the other day, the team manager there acknowledged how (in her opinion) most of the pods taste the same and how one has to figure out what they most lean more toward, and so far, I agree with her.

I’m the most fond of Altissio, Fortado, Stormio, and Odacio as of writing this. Therefore, I ask, what would y’all say are noteworthy flavors to try?",2,1731556245.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

A friend and I are taking a roadtrip to Vancouver from Seattle. We're planning to stay a couple nights. Generally, we know we want to do some vintage/boutique shopping (I'm so excited to see the real John Fluevog store. Ours is tiny), eat some really good Chinese food, and go to the Anthropology Museum, but beyond that, I'd love some suggestions. Also, this is maybe too specific, but if anyone knows any third wave coffee shops that serve a light roast but maintain a cozy vibe, I'd love that. 

And finally, we both love live music but will be eighteen at the time of the trip, so any all ages venues would be appreciated! From some googling I got the sense that liquor laws might be slightly different than in the U.S.? Are they more relaxed in terms of underaged people being in establishments that serve alcohol?

On top of the constant tension headache, I would get migraines 1-2 times a week, until about a year and a half ago when I started taking magnesium supplements. Then they went down to once a month which was such a relief, and normally would occur right before my period so I could kind of prepare.

The flavor description is: Sugar cookie flavored ice cream with chocolate chip cookies, snickerdoodles and sugar cookies, red sprinkles, and a green frosting swirl.

I have a Whynter ICM-15LS and access to major grocery stores. With a little googling, I have seen people create a sugar cookie base with sugar cookie flavored coffee creamer or sweetened condensed milk and whipping cream. For the frosting, would you just add canned frosting as you layer churned ice cream into the container? Any advice is much appreciated! Thank you!",2,1731555693.0,icecreamery,0,1.0,False
1gqvxur,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1gqvxur/i_asked_chatgpt_to_come_up_with_an_analogy_for/,I asked ChatGPT to come up with an analogy for what it's like going through an MBA program as an outcast ,"It's actually pretty good so I wanted to share. I don't know what the point of this post is. I guess its just to say if you are struggling to find your friends group or fit in at your MBA program - you are not alone. 

Also - don't give up! Even if you are on a full ride scholarship - the opportunity cost of being at a MBA program is still huge. Force yourself to go to the school-sanctioned events, read social skills books, invite people to go get coffee even if its scary. Take care of yourself. Remind yourself that you matter and you are great just the way you are, because how we feel on the inside, somehow it has a way of showing up on the outside and people can sense this. 

Hang in there - hopefully it will get better. 

Start of analogy: 

Imagine showing up to a giant potluck dinner where everyone was told to bring a dish to share. You spend hours preparing your signature dish, carefully thinking through every ingredient to make sure it’s something everyone will love. You arrive at the event with your dish, full of hope and excitement, but when you set it down on the table, nobody touches it.

Instead, they’re all gathered around other dishes, laughing, sharing stories, and piling their plates high. You try to join a few conversations, but you’re met with polite smiles that fade quickly, or worse, they simply don’t even register you’re there. Eventually, you find yourself sitting alone, your dish still untouched.

As the evening winds down, you’re left wondering if you should’ve made something different, if you somehow misread the invite, or if you just don’t belong there at all. But deep down, you know it’s not really about the dish; it’s about the fact that, despite your best efforts, you’re just… invisible.

And the potluck? It repeats every day, for two years.

Anyways my boyfriend told me how there is a woman he works with that he was friends with.  That wanted too me, since we both had pet cats and we liked cats.  One time my boyfriend told me heads up she flirts with others as a joke. I was like that's a bit weird but ok.

Anyways turns out she's married too a man, but she enjoys my boyfriend's company alot.
My boyfriend had been honest from the beginning that's he in a relationship with me.

This woman started flirting with my boyfriend alot, especially sexually. Sending sexual texts. Like winkey face do you like what you see. He didn't add her back on snapchat but he added her back on Facebook. My boyfriend doesn't have his last name or job description on Facebook yet she found him.

She was flirting alot with him, my boyfriend said he had too tell her too stop. At first she was a bit upset he couldn't be her sex play thing. 

The crazy thing is this woman excuses it with her husband cheated on her.   Anyways eventually my boyfriend called me cause he had been freaking out about it.

He does say he made the mistake of joking back with her when she flirts. Cause he thought she was joking.

She put a chocolate box on his desk supposedly.

He did set boundaries and she said I won't do anything without both your consents.

I just had enough one day and texted her how disgusting she was for flirting with my boyfriend.

My boyfriend was upset with me, thinking that I risked his job.

Am I the asshole.

Anyways she wonders too my boyfriend why I don't like her.  

She's made my boyfriend and I protect the secret that she's cheated from her husband.
I honestly don't like keeping this secret. I'm only keeping it for my boyfriend sake.

As I don't want my boyfriend in more of her drama or for her too take shit out on him.

My boyfriend says for me not to get tempted to expose her secret.

One day my boyfriend wants me too meet up with her and him that way he can avoid being alone with her.

He's only been too coffee with her once and too her house too meet her pet cats.

I've encouraged him not too be alone outside of work hours.

She seems to have calmed down for some reason she keeps calling him sweetie on texts and in person.

He is moving jobs and away from her luckily.


I unblocked her on Facebook.

She found my instagram, but once I followed back thinking it was just a regular cat account.  Until I showed my boyfriend.

I let her follow me, but the next day as soon as I followed her back she took me out of her followers and unfollowrd me.

Weird but oh well.

Anyways what do y'all think of this.

I had a work event that day so I wasn’t able to check much of the bag. To my dismay, pagkauwi ko, I noticed na they sold me a bag that’s expiring this December 2024 which more or less means the beans might’ve been pre-ground for more than a year or almost a year to date.

Nung una okay pa. May lasa pa pag 2 mins steep time using my AP. But habang tumatagal I had to steep 12g of coffee for 3:30 already para lang maging decent.

Whether that's the Costella family, or whatever *this* is, I'm not sure. 

The police are taking forever, and part of me knows they're either refusing to believe me, or RC got them too. 

I'm holed up on our school bus, so I've got nothing better to do. 

I want to tell you about my team. 

We met in our sophomore year. 

Strangers standing outside the club room. 

Levi was the freckled brunette who wouldn't stop talking about Game of Thrones.

Sunny, a pretty redhead, told him to shut up. 

Tom, a sandy blonde, nodding his head to music corked in his ears. 

I just wanted to be part of a club, and get away from my overbearing mother. 

I won't say it was a perfect start. 

Our school was lacking in funding, so anyone could join, which made us more of a Quiz Club. I had some serious anxiety, so I stayed on the sidelines for a while, watching, rather than taking part. 

It's not like we actually talked to each other initially. The first few weeks, we played Jeopardy, and attempted to find more members to cement us as an official Academic Decathlon club.

Unfortunately, though, it was just the four of us. 

Which made it extremely hard for us to be taken seriously. 

According to Google, Academic Decathlon teams were made up of nine members, placed by their GPA. 

Our principal laughed at us, but he *did* let us become official. 

Which was out of pity, I assumed. 

The club was assembled, and we started meeting up after school. 

Sort of. 

Sunny barely showed up, and Levi didn't take anything seriously, preferring to spend the time telling us about his weird family turf-war. 

Our principal dumped us in a tiny classroom with a resident rat living under the floorboards. 

There was barely enough room to move, and the four of us crammed together for three hours was less than appealing. 

Still, though, I wanted to be part of a club.

I had grown up with parents who were obsessed with board games, so I was pretty good at general knowledge questions. 

Our club room was too small for anything else but three desks (Sunny and I shared one) and a whiteboard we had to shove through the door. 

But, again, we didn't start as an Academic club.

It was more akin to Story Time Club. 

Arriving late on my third day, armed with quiz cards from home, I found Tom and Sunny completely mesmerised by Levi’s storytelling skills, drowned in shadow. 

They didn't even turn the lights on. 

I strictly remember squeezing next to Sunny, and hearing the words, *“But there was so much blood all over the floor, and my Mom told me to go upstairs and hide under the bed…”*

Sitting in front of them was Levi, perched on a desk, his legs swinging, a whiteboard marker between his teeth. 

Sometimes he'd get up, and illustrate parts of his story. 

It sucked that his drawings were all stick people. 

I won't go into full details of his life, but Levi grew up as part of a family who had… *interesting* methods of making a living. I had seen the guy’s father multiple times when we hung out at his place, and, yeah, my friend’s family definitely had Soprano vibes. 

Levi’s Draw My Life was nothing to do with the club, but it did bring us closer. 

Even if, at that point, I was considering leaving.

But it's not like it was easy to walk away from these guys. It's like finding your soulmates. 

Levi wasn't the only one with an interesting life. 

Sunny Lang was an ex kpop trainee, who was *kicked out for being too big,* which led her to develop a severe eating disorder, and a hatred for her own body. Sunny explained her family were originally from Boston, her mother growing up in Korea. 

She signed up for an idol agency focusing on creating a new girl group, and had gotten all the way to the final stages, before being kicked for her weight. 

Sunny told us her story with a smile, though there was a hollowness in her eyes I couldn't ignore. The other girls were judgemental bullies, and the idol diet and brutal regime almost killed her. 

Sunny lived in a tiny apartment with 9 girls, who would tear each other apart for a chance to debut. Sunny said all the other girls debuted, and when we (not so patiently) asked for names, she shrugged, admitting she signed an NDA that prevented her spilling the beans. 

What she *did* say, was the *K-pop idol* is a product, not a person– and are made and moulded *into* a product. 

She had zero interest in throwing her humanity away to become a manufactured doll. 

So, one of us was the son of an underground family, and the other was an ex idol. 

Tom was an aspiring horror writer with a famous older step-brother.

His story times were usually, *That one time I went to the Met Gala*.

When it was my turn to reveal my story, I told them the only interesting thing about me. 

I could *smell* when something bad was going to happen. 

They laughed, but I was being serious. 

When I was a kid, I smelled my mother’s brain tumor.

I remember it smelled like curdled milk. 

I asked Mom why her head smelled of mouldy milk, and Mom laughed and said it was her shampoo. 

It was actually a grade two tumor growing inside her brain. 

Thankfully, the tumour was found quickly and removed.

Growing older, I became sensitive to smell. The little girl choking on the bus smelled of singed wood, and the old man crossing the road stunk of gasoline. 

In the fourth grade, my classmate Alex Castor smelled of lemons all morning. 

I sat behind him, choking on the stink all the way through class. 

Ever since I met him, Alex had always smelled… off.

It was a distinct smell I could never understand, and as the days and months and years went by, that smell morphed into a subtle orangey musk that was so strong I had to cover my mouth and nose. Then, he smelled like lemons. 

During Recess, I watched Alex fall off of the jungle gym, straight onto his head. 

Alex Castor was dead before the paramedics arrived, my panicked teacher attempting CPR when his brains were leaking out of his ears. 

The school claimed it was an accident, but Alex would have been fine if the jungle gym wasn't built on solid concrete. 

I told my team members this, and Levi was sceptical. 

“You can *smell* bad things?” He said, his lips curved around his milkshake straw. In the early days, we hung out in the local bar. It's not like we were allowed inside, but Levi could get us in anywhere.

I was squeezed between Tom and Sunny, while Levi took the seat opposite us. I couldn't help noticing our waitress was insisting on free milkshake refills, her frantic eyes glued to Levi. 

I had zero idea why. Levi Costella was about as intimidating as a fruit fly. 

Wearing a white shirt with a popped collar, a leather jacket thrown over the top, Levi was giving rebellious Harvard student, rather than *son of a crime family*.

Leaning forward, he raised a brow, clearly not believing me. 

“So, you're like a stink psychic?”

I shrugged, sipping my own shake. 

“Sure.”

I wasn't planning on telling him the club room smelled *off* on our first day. 

Once we actually started the club, Levi surprised us as the smartest member, and getting to know him further, I came to the realization his family were infamous in our town. 

However, his parents hid it well. Lucy and Michael Costella were the owners of a popular ramen store in our town, hiding under the facade of two successful business owners. The Costella’s were an attractive family. 

Lucy was a sophisticated brunette with a  lipstick smile, Michael, a handsome fluffy haired man who looked like he modelled glasses.  

The two were fiercely protective over their youngest son, not so casually reminding us behind grinning smiles, that if anything happened to Levi, we would automatically be involved in the family.

I mean, they did laugh and say, “We’re joking! Look at your little faces!” when Sunny went deathly pale. But there was definitely truth behind their words.

Being Levi’s friend was… challenging at first. 

Tom and I were in his room studying for finals, and an alarm went off, flooding Levi’s room in red light. 

I had zero idea where it was coming from, but it locked all the doors and windows, forcing the Costella residence into temporary lockdown. Levi didn't seem fazed, casually mentioning his parents were *taking care* of *it*. 

He had a whiteboard set up in his room, and was standing in front of it, cramming all of our textbook notes into one easily digestible drawing. 

Levi wasn't just smart. 

He was *Ivy League* smart, so we had struck gold with him. 

His family were questionable, and yes, sometimes I did fear for my life,  but as the more time we spent at his house, the Costella household became a second home. We got used to the alarms. 

I just brought along ear plugs. 

I wish I was writing this post about Levi’s family, and sure, they are a factor in what is going on right now, but I want to preface this by saying the events below involve the 2024 scholastic decathlon final in our town with the school’s listed: 

**Starbrook High School.**

**Ratcliffe High School.**

Please note, the incident that took place last night was immediately covered up, and all phone footage was destroyed. Our town is mostly out of the way, and does not show up on Google searches.

We also have our own version of the academic decathlon, which is a more town-level competition, due to lacking funds. The four of us were desperate to start competing with our schools. 

So, we started taking things a little more seriously. 

We got a coach. 

Mr Hanes, who was hesitant at first. 

In his words, “You will hate me as your coach.”

He started by recruiting more members, announcing, “If you want to be taken seriously as an actual club, then I'll be taking the reins from now on.”

He did, and with our teachers guidance (and sometimes brutal honesty), we reached a level where we could start competing with other school’s in town. Now, none of us knew this, but Mr Hanes was *obsessed* with winning. 

So, club meetings were twisted into two hour study sessions with no talking, followed by Mr Hanes Jeaprody, which was *Jeaprody*, without the actual fun. 

We were quizzed multiple times, answer cards and practise questions quite literally thrown directly in our faces. 

I hate to admit this (I really hate to admit this) but Mr Hanes’s tactics worked. Sure, we had been mildly brainwashed by our slightly unhinged coach, but with Levi Costella, we destroyed our competitors. 

Like I said, our town held their own version of the academic scholastic decathlon, but it was pretty much the same, with some changes. 

Ten subjects. Language and Literature, Math, Social Science, Economics, Art, Music, Interview, Speech, and Essay. 

Unlike the official Decathlon, ours was more like a game show, with the ability to be knocked out if a team member answers a question wrong. Whoever answers the most questions correctly wins. Team meet ups were either tests, study sessions, or quizzing each other. 

Which leads me to last night. 

The finals were held in the reigning champions, Ratcliffe High School’s, auditorium. 

And we were about to win our town’s Scholastic Decathlon 2024 Championships. 

Well…I was knocked out in the music section. Standing next to my coach who I was sure was going to asphyxiate from excitement, I could smell the sudden potent stink of lemon. I tried to ignore it at first, but the more questions my team were answering correctly, the smell got worse, suffocating my senses. 

This wasn't just lemon. The stink was like a burning, singing smell trickling into my nose and the back of my throat.

It was stronger than what Alex smelled like. 

This was suffocating, drowning my thoughts. 

“Are you okay, Cassandra?” 

Mr Hanes nudged me when a Ratcliffe girl was struggling to answer a question, only for Sunny to jump in with the answer. “You look quite pale.”

I nodded, forcing a smile. 

My gaze was on the Ratcliffe coach, a scary looking blonde woman, whispering in one of her student’s ears. 

The Ratcliffe kid freaked me out. He was way too tall, dark blonde hair, and bulging eyes I swear were not blinking. 

His gaze was glued to Levi, who wore a smug grin. 

There was a smaller girl next to the Ratcliffe kid, a Macbook balanced on her knee. Every so often, he leaned into her, the two of them in deep conversation. 

“I'm just nervous.” 

I jumped when Ratcliffe scored a point, their side erupting into cheers. 

During the break, we had a mini team meeting.

Sunny rushed to the bathroom to freshen up, and I noticed a Ratcliffe girl with a bouncing ponytail following her.

Ignoring our coach’s speech, I joined the two girls in the corridor, that lemony scent hanging thick in the air. 

I caught them in an awkward position. 

The Ratcliffe girl had her fingers pinched between the material of Sunny’s dark blue shirt bearing our school’s name. 

Sunny looked confused, her lips parted like she was going to yell.

Ponytail dropped her hand, suddenly, with a nervous laugh. “Oh! I'm so, so, sorry,” she gushed. “You had, like, the biggest spider crawling on your back.” 

Sunny caught my eye, shooting me a reassuring smile.

“Thanks.” She made sure to keep her distance. “Uh, where's your bathroom?” 

The Ratcliffe girl nodded down the hallway. “It's just down there. I'm going there too if you want me to show you?”

Sunny motioned for me to go back to the auditorium. “Uh, sure! That'd be great!”

I did try to follow them, only for Sunny to cough loudly. 

I took the hint, reluctantly heading back into the auditorium. 

My team was hyping each other up, Levi in the centre, sweating through his team shirt. He ran a trembling hand through his hair. “I can't do this,” He groaned. “Ratcliffe High is known to play dirty, man. They're unbeatable.”

“In what way do they play dirty?” I asked, joining them. 

Levi gulped down water, shrugging. 

“I dunno! They're already trying to distract me with the stink eye.” The boy narrowed his eyes at a grinning Ratcliffe kid who, after noticing our stares, jumped to his feet, waving at us. 

*“Hey guys!”*

“That's Harry Cartwright, the son of the Cartwright family who tried to kill my parents in the third grade.” Levi mockingly waved back. “As you can see, their kid is a fucking sociopath.”

*Huh. I wasn't expecting the smiley kid to be the mobster’s son.*

Harry Cartwright was *not* what I expected. 

Unlike his team members, he was the only one in casual clothing, a short sleeved white shirt and jeans, a pair of sunglasses perched on top of his head. 

Tom went pale. 

“Fuck.” He hissed. “He’s one of you? Then those bastards will have a *reason* to play dirty, right?”

Levi shrugged, averting his gaze. It was the first time I saw his eyes darken, like he was subtly telling the boy to back off.

“The Cartwright’s have been trying to buy our land for a while,” he muttered. “I wouldn't put it past them to use the Decathlon as a way to attack.”

“Attack?!” April, another member of our team, hissed. “Like, *attack* attack?”

Mr Hanes grabbed the boy, resting his hands on Levi’s shoulders. “Ignore them,” he said. “Hey. Look at me.” 

Levi did, raising a brow. 

“You're losing that spark in your eye, young man.”

“Spark?”

Our coach nodded. “Look at me, kid.”

Levi rolled his eyes. “I *am* looking at you, Mr Hanes.”

The man was shaking. I was guessing his whole career (or coaching career) was on the line. 

“They know they're losing, Mr Costella.” 

Hanes shook the boy, squeezing his shoulders. “You are being positive and Ratcliffe doesn't like that. They want you to be nervous. They want to make you second guess yourself and lose confidence. Don't let them get into your head.” he smiled, giving the boy a playful shove. “Kick their asses.”

“Exactly!”

I didn't realize Sunny was back from the bathroom. 

The faint smell of lemons had followed her. I noticed a wet patch on her shirt collar, though she was quick to smile at me, admitting she'd spilled water down herself. Sunny wrapped her arms around Levi, squeezing him into a hug. 

She hung on for a little too long, Tom dragging her away with a laugh. “Good luck, all right?” she backed away, ruffling his hair. “We’ve got this!”

When I hugged Levi good luck too, I had to resist covering my nose. 

The smell of lemon was unbearable, just like fourth grade Alex. 

But it wasn't as potent as earlier. 

I vaguely remembered the smell starting to fade once Alex’s body was being carted away on a stretcher. 

Following my captain through the crowd, I was right. The smell was less suffocating. Before he went back to the stage, I grabbed the back of his shirt. 

*The material was soaking wet.*

“How are you so wet?” I said, swiping my hands on my shirt. 

“Huh?” 

I shook my head. “Never mind. Do you remember what I told you in sophomore year?” 

Levi settled me with a  confident, but nervous smile. “Thaaaat you're scared of clowns?”

“No. I mean the boy who smelled of lemons.” I gritted out. 

Levi surprised me with a laugh. “What are you talking about?”

Something ice cold trickled down my spine. 

Levi *did* know what I was talking about. He brought up my *stink sense* a day earlier in front of his parents, and I had to cover his mouth to shut him up. 

Leaning close, I whispered in his ear. “You stink of rotten lemons.”

He nodded slowly, pulling away. “Uh… thanks?”

I bit back a hiss of frustration. “No, you don't understand what I'm saying–”

“Starbrooke High School,” The host announced. “Can all members please return to the stage.”

Levi held up his hand for a high five. 

“Can we do this later?” He winked. “I'm kinda busy carrying this spelling-bee on my back right now.”

I nodded shakily, high fiving him, and letting him jump back onto the stage. 

Before his words hit like a tidal wave, ice cold water slammed into me. 

*Spelling Bee?*

Slowly making my way back to the stands, Levi’s mistake was circling around my head. He *did* win a spelling bee, but that was in middle school. 

Thankfully, the smell of lemons was gone when I returned to my seat. 

Mr Hanes handed me a soda. “Chill out, Cassandera, it's just a game.”

He could talk. The guy was on his fifth coffee. 

Mr Hanes was not *chilled out* in the slightest. 

Surprisingly, the event went well. I was half expecting my team to be crushed by the rafters, or caught in a blaze started in the crowd. But we were doing well. No, we were *winning*. 

Reaching the climaxing round, Sunny choked against a smug Ratcliffe boy, joining me on the sidelines. 

Levi answered the next question with a confident smile. 

We were winning, but Ratcliffe could still catch up with a miracle. 

The second to last question was to Ratcliffe, and it was general knowledge. 

*”Where on the human body would one find the *orbit*?*

I knew the answer, and so did Levi, his lips breaking out into a smile when the Ratcliffe boy was hesitating, eyes wide. 

Our school’s buzzer went off, Levi slamming his hand down. 

*Bzzz!*

The host turned to our team. “Starbrooke, can I have your answer?”

Levi nodded, shooting our team a victory grin. 

“It's…!“ He opened his mouth to answer, his jaw slackening suddenly. 

The boy’s shoulders slumped. 

“Uh… “ 

“Um…”

“Huhhhhh…”

Levi inclined his head, blinking, his eyes glazing over. There was a sudden, hollow vacancy that sent chills down my spine. It was like someone had reached into his skull, and yanked out his brain, leaving a shell in his place. 

To my confusion, our team captain frowned at his buzzer like he'd never seen one before. He pressed it, exploding into child-like giggles. 

*Bzzz!*

The audience laughed along nervously. 

Tom nudged me. “What the fuck is he doing?”

*Bzzz Bzzz Bzzz!*

Levi’s entire body was slumped, his hand slamming down on the buzzer. 

I caught something pooling down his chin. 

“Is he… drooling?” I whispered. 

Mr Hanes looked mildly horrified. “Has he been *drinking*?

“Levi?” Tom spluttered. “Drinking?!""

Whatever we were watching, however, was definitely influenced by… something. 

*Bzz*. *Bzz*. *Bzz*. *Bzz*. *Bzz*! 

“Young man, that is not a toy!”

The host wasn't amused. “Starbrooke High School, I need an answer from you,” He nodded to Levi, who was pressing the buzzer, his smile growing. 

“Once again,” The host backed away, like Levi was contagious. “Where on the human body would one find the *Orbit*?”

Levi cocked his head, lips parted.

His gaze found the overhead lights, and he winced, his lips curling into a frown. 

“Starbrooke High School!”

Levi jumped, tipping his head back and blowing a raspberry. “Palm tree?”

The audience laughed, and I started feeling nauseous. 

Across from us, I could see the twist of a smirk on the Ratcliffe coach’s lips. 

*Bzzz!* Levi slammed the buzzer again  giggling. 

“Starbrooke High School, if your team member continues to act like this, I will be forced to disqualify all members.”

Our captain stopped, gaze glued to the host, his hand creeping towards the buzzer, like it was a big red button. 

The audience loved it, laughing like they were watching a sitcom. 

“He wouldn't.” Tom whisper-shrieked. 

The auditorium was silent for a moment, awaiting Starbrooke’s response.

Levi stuck out his tongue, slamming his hand down. 

*Bzzz! Bzzz! Bzzz! Bzzz! Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz–*

When Tom dragged Levi away from his podium, a Ratcliffe girl hit her buzzer. 

“Starbrooke High School, you are disqualified,” the host announced. “Ratcliffe High School, do you have an answer?”

It was Ponytail who nodded with a grin. 

“The answer is the eye socket! The Orbit is part of the eye socket!”

“That is the correct answer.” The host was distracted, his eyes glued to Levi. 

“Ratcliffe High School wins.”

Levi jumped when the Ratcliffe wide erupted into cheers.

His eyes were wide, clinging onto the buzzer for comfort. 

Next to me, our coach looked like he was going to faint. 

I barely noticed Ratcliffe’s victory, too busy watching our team captain, who was Harvard bound, tipping his head back and smiling at the ceiling like a new-born baby. Tom dragged the stumbling boy over to me, his mouth twisted. 

“This was Ratcliffe, right?” He hissed, shaking our captain, who was struggling, squirming in his grip. 

“Did they put something in his drink?!” He prodded Levi. “Hey! What did they do to you?!”

Still, though, drugging his drink didn't make sense. 

Levi never left the auditorium, and kept his water bottle with him the whole time. 

How did they even manage to slip something into his drink in the first place? 

Did I *smell* our competitors drugging him? 

Sure, intentionally inebriating my teammate was morally wrong and illegal, but why could I smell lemon? 

“I doubt it was Ratcliffe.” Sunny appeared next to me. “I've been watching them. They're harmless.”

“Then how the fuck do we explain *this* to his parents?!” Tom whispered, grappling with Levi, who was fighting to get back to the buzzer. 

When Tom let go of him, he dropped onto the floor, crawling over to his podium. It was like watching a child. 

Who was determined to piss off the adults.

Levi jumped back to unsteady feet, his gaze was glued to the host, a smile curved on his lips, when he slammed the buzzer again. 

*Bzzz!*

“Someone, please remove the Starbrooke boy from the stage!”

I was embarrassed, our whole team ducking our heads as our captain was forcibly removed from the podium. 

Mr Hanes grabbed Levi, pulling him off of the stage. 

I expected our coach to be mad at him, but I think the teacher was more worried, a phone pressed to his ear while he forced the boy into a sitting position. 

*No, I don't think it's influence from alcohol,* I could hear his conversation. 

Levi kept trying to get up, mesmerised by the buzzer. The teacher was firm but gentle. “Hey. Sit down, all right? Keep still.” He went back to his phone call, gently prying Levi’s eyes open. 

*From what I can see, there's nothing wrong. He's just kind of…* 

Mr Hanes swiped his own hands on his jeans.  *... wet?*

Team Ratcliffe came over to rub it in our faces, though I was still tuned into our coach’s hissed whispering. 

*Water? No, I don't think it's water. It smells… no, I haven't told his parents…*

“You guys did *awesome*!” Ponytail's voice was sugary sweet. *Too* sugary. 

She held the 2024 trophy, bearing a satisfied smile. I noticed the Ratcliffe members were surrounding Harry, like guards. 

“Better luck next time, okay?” She held out her hand, her eyes twinkling.

“No hard feelings?” 

“Control your *dog*.” Harry said, amused eyes flicking to Levi, who was once again sprinting back to the fucking buzzer. 

His eyes had visibly darkened, lips curled into a triumphant smile. 

Harry Cartwright was watching Mr Hanes chase our team captain like it was his own personal entertainment. 

I had to look away before I died of second hand embarrassment. 

“What did you put in his drink?” Tom demanded. “Weed? Edibles?” the boy attempted to shove Harry, only to be pushed back. “What the fuck did you do to him?”

Harry’s smile didn't waver. “Like I said. Control your *mut*.”

When the Ratcliffe team walked away, our red faced coach struggling with Levi, who was behaving progressively more erratically, informed us we were longer welcome inside the school. 

Tom suggested calling an ambulance, but our coach was hesitant. 

We all knew who Levi’s family were. 

On the way out, Tom matched my stride. He was frowning at our team captain struggling to walk. 

The way he was acting was already eyebrow raising. 

But walking at an angle and being unable to stand up straight was worrying. 

“I don't think they drugged his drink.” Tom muttered. 

We pushed through the doors out of the school, and I revelled in the cool night air grazing my cheek. “If they did, he would be acting out of it, right? So, what's the deal with him acting like–”

“A child.” I finished for him. 

“Yeah.” Tom leaned closer. “Do you think this has something to do with their turf war?”

I slapped at a bug creeping across my cheek. 

Levi fell over again, this time bursting into giggles. 
 
“Almost definitely.”

Levi was right about Ratcliffe playing dirty. I didn't realize *how* dirty until we were on the losers bus home. Levi was in the seat next to me, and the kid hadn't moved since we left Ratcliffe, his eyes wide, lips pulled into a dazed grin. 

*Bzzz!*

The noise startled me from slumber. I was drooling, my head pressed against the window. Outside, the sky was pitch dark, and squinting through the glass, I couldn't get a bearing on where we were. I thought I was hearing things, but when I sat up, I heard it again. 

*Bzzz!*

It was close. 

Leaning over the boy, I glimpsed a smear of scarlet on his headrest. 

I choked on my next words. 

“Tom.” 

Tom was in front of me, listening to music. 

He didn't reply, his head of dark blonde curls nodding to the beat. 

“Levi.” I managed to get out. I prodded him, and his head lolled into his shoulder. “Hey. Can you… sit up?”

Bzzz! Bzzz!

When the boy didn't move, I gently grabbed his shoulders and pulled him forward myself, something contracting in my stomach. 

I  don't know how long it takes for your mind to fully register something, but my body was already reacting. 

Levi’s seat was infested with *bugs*, eating their way through the upholstery. I was aware of my body moving back. I  threw up, instantly, screaming into my hand. 

The back of my best friend's skull resembled a deflated soccer ball, what was left of his brain leaking from his skull where a swarm of skittering bugs chewed their way through brain tissue, metallic legs scratching the curved, pearly white of the base if his skull. 

Levi’s head hung, his body flopping into mine. 

But his eyes were still open, lips still stretched into a smile. 

Blood ran in thick rivulets from his nose and ears. 

*Bzzz!*

I could see them, black writhing dots alive in his eyes, wriggling movement under his skin. 

“Tom!” 

I jumped up, stumbling into the aisle, my stomach heaving. 

And it was only when I was on my knees, swiping bile from my lips, when I realized the others weren't reacting. 

Tom wasn't moving. 

I pulled an Airpod out of his ear, a long, slithering string of pink attached to the end. 

There was a stray bug skittering across his hand, his face starting to twitch and writhe. 

Moving back, I checked myself over, my hands shaking. 

Head. 

Shoulders. 

Hair. 

Clawing through it, my breath was stuck in my throat. 

Arms. 

Legs. 

Feet. 

Mr Hanes was slumped against the window, a reddish froth bubbling from his mouth. 

Sunny. 

I started towards the back of the bus, but all I had to see was her bowed head, half of her skull chewed through. 

Sunny was in a far more deteriorated state, her face had been ripped through,  a skeletal smile glinting in the dim. 

The thick black smear on the window next to her was *moving.* 

When I screamed for the driver to stop the bus, he ignored me. 

If anything, he stamped on the gas. 

I moved forward to shake him, before glimpsing a bug creeping down his face. 

Calling 911, the operator laughed at me. 

*“Bugs are eating your friends.” He said. “Do you know the penalty for calling with bullshit pranks?”*

The bus didn't stop, so I stayed at the front, while the bugs took over the back, eating through my teammates. 

After four hours, I risked leaning over the seat next to Tom to check on Levi. 

They were eating him.

Chewing all the way through skin, muscle and bone.

I tried to stop the bus, but the driver’s hands were tightly wrapped around the wheel. 

Another hour, and blood was seeping down the aisle, crawling with bugs. 

Levi was gone, and in his place, a buzzing skittering pile of bugs, that I thought were going to move to a second victim, maybe burrowing into the seats. 

But, no. 

These things began to tremble, replicating. 

Building. 

Slowly, *nothing* became static, and static became muscle. 

Then bone. 

Then flesh. 

When a body began to slowly form, moulded from the dead boy, I stumbled back. 

These things weren't eating Levi Costella. 

They were *rewriting* him. 

… 

Edit: I'm still on the bus. I'm 99.9% sure that I'm infected with whatever this thing is. I can't stop fucking itching. 

I keep picking them off me but they won't stop. This bus isn't going to stop until I'm like the others. 

… 

Edit 2: 

I can feel them chewing into my skull. They're in my ears. I keep spitting them out. Please, someone get them off of me. Help me. I don't want to die at 17.

Edit 3: 

Still alive. Still breathing. Maybe they're leaving me alone????? I think I'm okay. There is a pile of bugs at my feet, but they're crawling off of me. 

Edit 4:

Levi really wants to go home. Like, he just told me he REALLY wants to go home. He's got a gift for his parents. 


~~Edit 5 :) ~~

Levi is next to me right now, an odd smile on his face. 

The bugs are not finished building him yet, but he'll be ready soon. 

*We* will be ready soon.

Your son says hello! He is a wonderful boy, is he not? 

Mr and Mrs Costella, I cannot wait for you to meet him.

He is our greatest achievement, and rest assured, you *will* give us what we want.

Warm regards.

1gqvesk,https://i.redd.it/4h1cqkyyas0e1.jpeg,New to pre diabetes,"Hello all,

I’ve generally been a really healthy person. Vegetarian for 25 years, low carb / keto for 15 and generally don’t eat processed foods. I’ve been a blood glucose checker for years as I’ve always wanted to know what my food does to me for all the reasons you know, and I’ve enjoyed experimenting. So I’ve been pretty high fat and enjoying that though either my body said no or a virus came along and one day a few months ago I got pancreatitis that went into chronic pancreatitis. So that was a thing though coming out of it I noticed my blood glucose was really high. My doc didn’t mention this might be a thing though now my numbers are well into pre diabetes.

I’ve been super strict to try to turn this thing around and am basically a raw vegan and supplement with a natural whey protein concentrate shake for protein and just general calories. I’ve also started lifting weights which has helped though I cannot get my daytime glucose under 6mmo/l. I’m wondering if this elevated number is enough to cause damage? Dr Berg from memory, if you know know him from YouTube, says any number above something like 5.4 is had though that just seems impossible. I’m wondering what your thoughts are - should I consider meditation or keep it natural and just keep on trying?

For reference, all I have had today for this graph is a black coffee and a boiled egg (trying something new with the egg) for breakfast at 7 and a protein shake at about 11:30. 

Thanks for your time, I really appreciate your thoughts ",0,1731553974.0,diabetes,0,0.5,False

For background: 24F, 5’4”, 163-ish lbs (currently losing weight) and the only meds I take are YAZ (birth control) and a multivitamin. 

My skin has just started to turn this splotchy red color after showers. I use Pantene shampoos and conditioner with Dove orange antibacterial soap bars. Been using these exact products for about a year now, and this color change just started about a month ago. The only thing new is a sugar scrub I’ve been doing, but this shows up even if I don’t do the scrub.

Shows up in hot or cold. It happens on my legs and arms most noticeably, and usually after applying the soap but sometimes before? It doesn’t really itch or burn, just gets red. No swelling, either.

I know my skin is also just very sensitive to temperatures. My feet always turn blue as soon as it gets cold. I can’t hold even a slightly hot coffee or even cold drinks at times without red marks on my hands. A simple smack to my arm turns the area a slight red color.

I was picking people I did not find attractive. I matched with a guy who seemed interesting and meeting for coffee and talking about hobbies and stuff. We chatted for a few days online only and I never moved off the platform. He said he was visiting my town I told him I was already busy with another male friend the day he was arriving. 
This tinder guy went mental on me, accusing me of leading him on and blamed it on my friend I was spending time with. 
I told him that we clearly weren’t looking looking for the same things and to get a grip on himself, I unmatched and blocked him. 

Fast forward 2 months and he shows up on my snap. Asking to meet up as he was coming to town again. He asked if I was still seeing my friend, I said yes. He sent me pictures of himself with 🔫(How did he find me?) He went stupid angry at me. WTF? He said he wasn’t violent and I said he was aggressive and not to contact me again. Blocked on this platform now.

At this point I told my friend about this guy. I didn’t necessarily say he got agro cos I was hanging out with him…… I didn’t think anything of it.

The ‘man’ then sends me messages (i think it was him- it looks like his writing as English is not his 1st language) on my business FB and IG. I report and block. I don’t hear from him again. I’m wary though cos I have a couple of other public profile platforms with my pictures etc.

**(I have been using the new TikTok AI for answers on this ‘man’ and some of the terms he was using for clarity)

A couple of weekends ago I got weird random banner flag notifications from TikTok, it was addressed to me and looked like it was from me. I posted about this on r/TikTok. I told my friend about it at this point cos the message read ‘stay away from him’. It freaked me out. 

My friend has since unfollowed me and won’t respond to me. 😭😭😭 I sent a letter apologising but I’m the bloody victim here. My therapist told me to tell him and not hold in my emotions. Now he won’t talk 😭

It happens that the banners were from TikTok AI!!!! I have photo evidence that the AI is sending them now. 

So AITA for telling my friend I was being harassed due to this ‘man’ getting the wrong idea? What did I do wrong? I trusted all the wrong people and I’m shattered and don’t want to exist cos the only person I trusted turned their back on me.",0,1731553012.0,AITAH,3,0.33,False

1gquxxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1gquxxj/i_think_my_daughters_doll_is_possessed/,I think my daughter's doll is possessed,"Thrift shopping had always been a sort of ritual for my wife and me. We’d hit up estate sales, thrift stores, garage sales, even old shops on their last legs, picking up whatever caught our eye to breathe new life into our home. Nearly everything around us had a story—things that, in their quiet way, had been through someone else’s life before they became part of ours. Cookware, furniture, our daughter’s toys, clothes—it didn’t matter. If it was well-made and had some years left, it was good enough for us.

Growing up the way we did, my wife and I both learned early on not to waste anything. We weren’t poor now, not by a long shot, but when you’ve spent your childhood stretching every dollar, that “waste-not” mentality never fully leaves. It’s more than a habit; it’s instinct.

I’d become something of a hawk for deals, tracking social media for those inevitable posts about local stores closing down, big sales, liquidations—anything with a shot at uncovering a hidden gem. It was like a hobby. And that’s how I found out about the toy store. An old post, buried deep on the community page, announced the auction of a local toy shop that had been a fixture in the town since the Great Depression.

The place was special. I’d been there once as a kid, and I remembered the almost magical feeling of the store—the smell of old wood and varnish, the glint of paint on row after row of handmade toys. This wasn’t your usual toy store. The owner, an older man everyone knew as Mr. Winslow, had poured his life into every toy, carving and painting each one by hand. Wooden soldiers, miniature dollhouses, delicate puzzles… everything you could imagine. He never imported a single thing, and every toy had a strange, vintage charm that you couldn’t find anywhere else.

Mr. Winslow and his wife had run the shop right up until they died, years apart. They didn’t have any family left, so the state had seized the property, and now they were auctioning everything off, right down to the last hand-carved toy. 

The sale was on a cold, gray Saturday. I convinced my wife it’d be worth checking out, maybe picking up a few toys for our daughter. The place was in rough shape, dim and drafty. Half the lights didn’t work, and the smell of dust lingered heavy in the air, clinging to everything like a veil. But the toys—they were immaculate. Each shelf was still filled with tiny wooden faces frozen in mid-expression, each toy glancing out at us, wide-eyed and almost… expectant. 

The crowd at the auction was familiar, dotted with faces I’d seen at sales like this before. Liquidation sales bring out a certain kind of person. You can always tell who’s a regular and who’s new to the scene just by watching them bid. The newcomers hesitate, test the waters before committing to any serious bid. But the regulars, the seasoned ones, they’ve got a rhythm. They know exactly how high to go, exactly when to pull back. Most of them aren’t there to pick up keepsakes; they’re there to flip it all for a profit online.

In most liquidation sales, they bundle the goods in bulk, which suits the resellers just fine. You see a table stacked with, say, a hundred of the same porcelain vase or unopened action figure; people bid on the lot, the highest bidder picks their fill, and then the next one steps up. It's efficient. By the end, whatever’s left just goes for the average bid price, first come, first serve.

But Mr. Winslow’s toy store wasn’t your average liquidation. No one was here for bulk toys from China, and no one was going to find a stack of hot-ticket items like last season’s electronics. Every item was unique, hand-crafted and individually priced. There wasn’t a single barcode in the building, not a plastic wrapper in sight. Every toy was a labor of love, something that had been sanded, painted, and assembled by hand. It was like stepping into a time capsule, each piece carrying a bit of the old man’s life and passion.

The toys looked like relics from another era: wooden horses with faded paint, lines of tin soldiers standing rigid, delicate porcelain dolls with blank, glassy eyes. There were marionettes on thin, tangled strings, and intricate dollhouses with hand-painted wallpaper and tiny furniture inside. Toys made for another world, another life. Most of the people there took one look and left early, their disinterest written all over their faces. These weren’t things that would sell for much online. And with the store’s gloomy atmosphere and the unsettling shadows cast by the dim light, I didn’t blame them.

But I was in it for more than a quick sale. I’d come to find a treasure, maybe something special to put on a shelf for our daughter or a keepsake to remind me of a place that had been in the town forever. So I stayed, wandering the aisles, running my fingers along the toys’ edges, feeling the worn, chipped paint under my fingers.

The auction had turned out to be a bust. I wandered around the store one last time, eyeing the shelves filled with dusty old toys, and I was just about ready to leave empty-handed when my daughter tugged on my sleeve.

“Daddy, look!”

She pointed to a battered old toy box shoved in a corner. Sitting upright inside it, propped against the side like she’d been carefully placed there, was a plush doll. But this wasn’t just any stuffed toy. The doll was eerily life-sized—just about the same height as my daughter, in fact. It had stringy blonde hair that cascaded messily down its shoulders, two large button eyes stitched onto a cloth face, and a stitched-on smile that seemed just a little too wide, curling up at the edges in a way that didn’t quite feel right. The doll wore a faded black dress with lace trimming, adding to its peculiar charm.

My daughter rushed over, her face lighting up with excitement. She plucked the doll from the toy box and hugged it tightly, like she’d found a long-lost friend. “Her name is Dolly!” she declared, squeezing the doll with the kind of fierce, unfiltered affection only a child can muster.

I looked at the doll more closely, a little unsettled by its fixed, button-eyed stare and that odd smile that seemed to follow me even as I shifted from side to side. There was something strange about its proportions, almost as if it had been crafted specifically to look like a child… but not quite.

The auctioneer, clearly tired of a morning spent trying to hawk dusty old toys to an uninterested crowd, noticed my interest and gave a half-hearted wave.

“Take it if you want,” he said with a shrug. “Ain’t nobody bidding on this junk. Most of it’s headed for the dump. You find anything else you like, feel free to pick through it. Won't cost you more than a few dollars.”

The truth was, there wasn’t anything else in that store I wanted, and after an auctioneer calls the merchandise “garbage,” it’s a good hint to leave. I paid him a few dollars for Dolly, who was now practically glued to my daughter’s side. She clutched the doll’s hand, looking at me with a beaming grin that melted any lingering doubts I might have had.

As we left, I noticed that my daughter was oddly quiet. Normally, she’d chatter all the way home, talking about every little thing she saw, but this time, she just held Dolly close, staring out the window with a sort of distant expression, almost like she was… listening. It was subtle, but it was there. I chalked it up to the thrill of her new toy, and figured she was probably just imagining adventures for Dolly, weaving stories in her head like she often did.

Still, something felt strange. I couldn’t shake the feeling that the doll’s stitched-on eyes were watching me, even as I drove, catching glimpses of it in the rearview mirror. And though my daughter was silent, there was a sort of tension in the car, a quiet that seemed to settle in like a chill.

We pulled into the driveway, and I glanced back at my daughter, who was still holding Dolly, her fingers entwined with the doll’s soft fabric hand. She looked up at me with a serene smile.

“She really likes it here, Daddy,” she whispered, as if Dolly herself had somehow told her.

The words sent a shiver down my spine. I told myself I was just being paranoid. After all, it was just a doll, a cheap, old-fashioned plush left over in a toy store no one cared about.

But as we stepped inside, I couldn’t help feeling we’d brought something else home with us that day, something that had been waiting patiently in that dusty corner, in a forgotten store full of discarded things. And now, it had found a new place to belong.

In the weeks that followed, my daughter’s attachment to Dolly grew into an obsession. At first, my wife and I thought it was adorable. Kids have imaginary friends all the time, right? And if she wanted to treat Dolly as her special friend, that seemed harmless enough. 

At any given moment, you could find my daughter playing with Dolly. She held tea parties for the two of them, setting up our good china in tiny rows on her play table. Dolly always had the seat of honor, perched across from my daughter, her button eyes staring straight ahead, her strange stitched smile ever-present.

When it wasn’t tea parties, it was “school.” My daughter would line up her other stuffed animals, but Dolly was always in the front row, right under her watchful eye. I’d hear her talking to Dolly, sometimes even scolding her in a low, serious voice, like she was dealing with a difficult student. She’d talk with Dolly while watching TV, telling her all the things that were happening on the screen as if the doll was hanging onto every word. We chalked it up to a vivid imagination.

But soon, things started to feel… different. I noticed my daughter no longer touched any of her other toys. They lay scattered around her room, gathering dust. Her entire world revolved around Dolly.

One evening, we sat down for dinner. It was spaghetti night, my daughter’s favorite, and my wife had gone all out. We called her to the table, expecting her to leave Dolly behind like usual. But tonight, she walked into the dining room, gripping Dolly by the arm, and carefully set her down on the chair next to her.

“Can Dolly have a plate too?” she asked, her voice full of a strange kind of insistence.

My wife and I exchanged a glance, an uneasy one. We both shrugged it off and played along, thinking it was just a phase. My wife set an empty plate in front of Dolly, miming a spoonful of spaghetti onto it with a playful smile.

But our daughter’s face fell, her expression crumpling as she stared down at the empty plate in front of Dolly.

“She needs real food, Mom,” she said, her voice small and hurt.

“Honey, she gets special pretend food, because she’s a pretend person,” my wife explained gently, trying to meet her halfway.

My daughter’s expression twisted into something dark and angry, a look we’d never seen from her before. Her face flushed, and her eyes filled with tears as she screamed, “No! Dolly hasn’t eaten in decades! She’s *hungry!*”

The words came out in a wail, raw and full of a desperate, gut-wrenching emotion that seemed so out of place. It was as if she was pleading for a real, living person, as though Dolly’s hunger was a tangible, undeniable fact. She grabbed the doll, cradling it protectively as if we had wronged it, her face red with frustration and hurt.

When we tried to calm her down, she started kicking, screaming, inconsolable. She clung to Dolly, her knuckles turning white, her small voice rising in a frantic, guttural cry that we’d never heard from her before. Eventually, we had no choice but to pick her up, gently prying her from Dolly’s side. She thrashed and shouted as we carried her to her room, leaving Dolly alone at the kitchen table.

As I closed her bedroom door, my heart still pounding from the outburst, I found myself staring back at the dining room. There sat Dolly, her button eyes unblinking, her crooked smile staring straight ahead as if mocking me.

The room felt quiet, too quiet, and as I stood there, I could’ve sworn I saw the faintest twitch in Dolly’s stitched mouth—a subtle shift, as if she were smiling just a bit wider. I shook it off, forcing myself to laugh at the absurdity of it. It was just a doll. Just fabric and stuffing.

But as I turned out the kitchen light, leaving Dolly in the darkness, I couldn’t shake the feeling that, somehow, she was still watching me.

It took a long time to calm our daughter down. She kept sniffling, wiping at her nose, and muttering how unfair it was that Dolly hadn’t been given food. She clutched at her pajamas, her small fists trembling with frustration and sorrow, saying she just wanted Dolly to be happy. My wife, always the peacemaker, gave me a gentle nudge.

""Just get the doll, please,"" she whispered, glancing back at our daughter. “It’ll help her calm down.”

I nodded, reluctantly heading back to the kitchen, feeling a strange knot forming in my stomach. As I walked into the room, an odd chill seeped into my skin, making me pause at the doorway.

Dolly wasn’t where we’d left her.

We had set her at the dinner table, facing her empty plate, exactly where my daughter had insisted. But now she was turned in her chair, her body rotated to face down the hallway—the hallway that led to my daughter’s room. Her button eyes seemed to glint in the dim light, her crooked smile somehow looking sharper, hungrier.

I shook my head, brushing off the unsettling feeling as a trick of the light. It was just a doll. Maybe the chair had shifted when my daughter thrashed in the dining room, and in the chaos, I just hadn’t noticed.

I picked Dolly up, her fabric cold against my skin, and carried her back to my daughter’s room. I stepped inside, and the moment my daughter saw Dolly in my hands, her face lit up, her eyes going wide with relief and joy. She jumped up, practically launching herself at me to grab her beloved doll. The way she held Dolly… it was like she was reuniting with a real friend, someone she’d been separated from for a lifetime.

“Thank you, Daddy,” she whispered, clutching Dolly tightly, pressing her cheek against the doll’s button-eyed face. My wife sat beside her on the bed, running her fingers through our daughter’s hair, soothing her. 

As the tension in the room faded, my daughter murmured something, barely a breath.

“What did you say, sweetie?” I asked, leaning closer.

She looked up at me, her face soft and serene, and repeated it, her voice clear. “Dolly’s full now.”

A shiver ran through me, but before I could think too much of it, she broke into a grin, her usual playful energy returning. “Can I watch TV now?”

My wife shot me a confused glance but quickly regained her composure. “After you eat your dinner, okay?”

Our daughter nodded, happily returning to the dining room to finish her meal. She didn’t ask about Dolly’s food, didn’t protest or insist on setting an extra plate. She ate without complaint, chattering occasionally about her favorite cartoons. The strange outburst over Dolly seemed forgotten, almost as if it hadn’t happened at all.

After dinner, she padded off to the living room and settled in front of the TV, Dolly perched beside her, her tiny hands still wrapped around the doll’s. We exchanged wary glances, but neither of us dared speak the questions lingering in our minds. The quiet in the house had returned, as if nothing unusual had happened at all.

That night, there were no more whispers about Dolly being hungry, no more outbursts or demands for extra plates at the table. My wife and I, unsure of what to make of it, decided to let it go. Whatever had happened, our daughter was calm, happy even. And if Dolly had something to do with that, well… we weren’t about to argue with a win.

That night, after we’d tucked our daughter into bed and cleaned up the kitchen, my wife and I sat together at the dining room table, mulling over the evening’s strange events.

""She’s eight now,” my wife said, her voice low, like she didn’t want to risk our daughter hearing, even though her room was on the other side of the house. “Isn’t she a little old to be pretending a doll is… well, *real*?”

I nodded, rubbing my temples. “I was thinking the same thing. I mean, she did this before, but back when she was really little—two or three, maybe. And even then, it wasn’t this intense.”

We’d both noticed that her behavior with Dolly was different than her usual flights of imagination. At that age, she’d had a few imaginary friends, nothing we worried about. She’d talk to her stuffed animals, play-act scenarios; it was normal stuff. But now, with Dolly, her behavior seemed… fervent. Like Dolly wasn’t just a doll she liked, but something essential, almost sacred to her.

“We could… maybe take the doll away?” I suggested, not liking the idea even as I said it.

My wife shook her head. “If we just took Dolly, she’d be inconsolable. And honestly, I don’t want another outburst like tonight. We’d have to handle it carefully.”

After a few minutes of back and forth, we came up with a plan: we’d gradually phase Dolly out. We’d get our daughter hooked on something new, a fun toy or playset she couldn’t resist, and once she’d lost interest in Dolly, we’d quietly take the doll away while she was at school.

But this plan was harder to execute than we thought.

We spent the next week scouring stores for the latest toys—something we usually avoided given our thrift-shop lifestyle. We bought dolls with accessories, elaborate playsets, building kits, anything we thought might catch her attention. We figured we’d splurge just this once if it meant keeping her happy and moving her away from Dolly.

Yet, no matter what we brought home, she barely looked at the new toys. Her enthusiasm was tepid, at best. She’d unwrap the new toy, inspect it with a polite sort of interest, and then inevitably wander back to wherever Dolly was waiting. My wife and I tried everything, even bringing home a new board game, hoping it’d be something we could play together as a family. But Dolly was always right there, tucked under my daughter’s arm or seated by her side, a silent companion with her button eyes and stitched smile, watching us from across the table.

Finally, in a last-ditch effort, we went out and bought her a tablet. We figured that with all the educational games, drawing apps, and videos at her fingertips, surely she’d be glued to it like most kids her age. But she barely gave it a second glance.

“Thanks, Mom and Dad,” she said when we handed it to her, but there was something distant in her eyes. She held Dolly close, almost protectively, her thumb tracing the doll’s tiny hand. “But… Dolly doesn’t like tablets.”

The words, though innocent enough, sent a chill down my spine. It was like she was speaking not for herself, but on behalf of her doll, as though Dolly had a voice, an opinion, a preference.

My wife and I exchanged worried glances. We’d tried everything, and it seemed our daughter’s attachment to Dolly was only deepening. She barely even touched the new toys; they lay untouched in her room, some still in their boxes, collecting dust.

With a heavy heart, we decided to go forward with our original plan. We would wait until she was at school, slip Dolly out of sight, and hope that, with enough new distractions around her, she’d find something else to latch onto. We both felt a pang of guilt—seeing the joy Dolly brought her, the way her face lit up when she held the doll, made it hard to imagine taking that away. But our concern for her well-being outweighed everything else.

So, we waited, biding our time, and hoped—hoped that, in Dolly’s absence, our daughter would turn her attention to one of the other toys.

But deep down, I had a feeling this wouldn’t go as smoothly as we hoped.

The night before we were set to pull off our plan, I had the strangest dream. At least, I *think* it was a dream.

I was lying in bed, staring up at the ceiling, when a chill crept over me. It felt like something was watching us, something cold and patient. I didn’t want to look, but in the way dreams force you, I felt my eyes drift toward the end of the bed. There, just at the edge of my vision, was Dolly. She was standing up, perfectly still, her button eyes fixed on me. I couldn’t make out any details—just her shadowy outline, a figure waiting silently, as if she had all the time in the world. Every time I tried to turn my head to look directly at her, she vanished, slipping back into the corner of my sight.

When I woke up, my heart was pounding, my skin damp with cold sweat. I shook it off, trying to convince myself it was just the stress of the past few weeks getting to me.

That morning, as planned, my wife took our daughter to school, distracting her with promises of a new game they’d play together that evening. The house felt unnaturally still once they were gone, a heavy silence that seemed to press against my skin.

I took a deep breath, heading into my daughter’s room, where Dolly was resting on her bed. Picking her up felt strange, like I was holding something more than just a doll. I avoided looking into those button eyes and quickly made my way to the pantry. I stuffed her into the top back corner, where my daughter wouldn’t think to look, carefully positioning her behind a stack of canned goods.

As expected, when my daughter came home and saw that Dolly was missing, all hell broke loose. The tantrum was unlike anything I’d ever seen. She stormed through the house, screaming, throwing things, demanding we give Dolly back. It was as if she was possessed by some uncontainable rage, her small face twisted into an expression that was both heartbroken and furious. My wife and I tried to calm her down, to reason with her, but she wasn’t listening.

""Where’s Dolly?” she shrieked, her voice hoarse from crying. “You’ll regret this! Dolly’s going to hurt you! She’ll make you sorry! Give her back!”

Her words left a chill running through my veins. This wasn’t our daughter speaking, not the sweet, gentle child we’d raised. She’d always been polite, soft-spoken, never the kind of kid who threw tantrums or even raised her voice much. But now, she seemed almost feral, her eyes wild with an intensity that was… unnerving.

The tantrum went on for hours, our daughter’s screams echoing through the house, until she finally wore herself out. With her voice raw and every tear shed, she collapsed onto the couch, exhausted and half-asleep. My wife and I sat nearby, sharing exhausted, worried glances, feeling like we’d made a terrible mistake but unable to go back on our decision now. Once we were sure she was asleep, we carried her to her bed, laying her down gently and turning on her night light. We murmured soft goodnights, though we made sure not to wake her.

We thought the worst of it was over for the night, that we’d weathered the storm and could finally get a moment to breathe.

But when we walked back into the living room, a chill settled over me, prickling the back of my neck. My heart dropped when I saw it.

There, sitting on the couch in the exact spot where my daughter had just been sleeping, was Dolly. She sat upright, her button eyes fixed straight ahead, her stitched smile just a little too wide, too knowing. 

We stood there, frozen, staring at her in stunned silence. Neither of us had touched the doll since I’d hidden her in the pantry. There was no way she could have gotten back to the living room on her own.

My wife reached out, her hand trembling, as if to pick Dolly up, but then thought better of it and pulled her hand back, wrapping her arms around herself instead.

I could feel the words I wanted to say caught in my throat. Instead, I moved forward slowly, as if approaching something dangerous, and took Dolly in my hands, her fabric cold and somehow… heavier than before. I was careful not to look at her too closely, afraid that if I met those button eyes for too long, I’d see something I couldn’t unsee.

I brought her back to the pantry, stuffing her into the corner again, this time piling more cans in front of her, pushing them in tightly to make sure she wouldn’t move. I left the pantry, shutting the door firmly behind me.

When I returned to the living room, my wife was still standing there, her face pale. We didn’t say a word. We just sat there in silence, the weight of that empty stitched smile lingering in the room.

And as we sat there, I found myself thinking about my daughter’s words, her warning echoing in my mind: “Dolly’s going to hurt you. She’ll make you sorry.”

My wife and I sat on the couch, staring at each other, hearts pounding in our chests, with the realization that neither of us had moved Dolly from her hiding place in the pantry. We both knew it couldn’t have been our daughter, either; she’d been asleep the whole time. And yet… there was Dolly, sitting in the exact spot where our daughter had drifted off on the couch, like she’d claimed it as her own.

“This is too much,” my wife whispered, her voice shaky. “I don’t want that doll in the house anymore. Please, just… get rid of it.”

She looked at me with pleading eyes, and I couldn’t blame her. Every logical part of me wanted to dismiss what was happening, but that feeling—that lingering chill creeping down my spine—told me it was best to listen. I didn’t want Dolly here, either. Whatever this was, it needed to end.

I scooped Dolly up, feeling that unnatural heaviness in her again, like she was almost pulling me back, as if the doll didn’t want to leave. I ignored the way her stitched smile seemed to stretch just a little more as I turned toward the door, telling myself it was just a trick of my tired mind. I had to get her out.

Outside, the early morning was eerily quiet. The community dumpster stood at the far end of the lot, and I made my way over, clutching Dolly tight, every step feeling more difficult than the last. A weight, like icy fingers, seemed to wrap around my shoulders, tendrils of dread clawing at my chest. It was ridiculous; I knew it was just a doll, but it felt like something was whispering in my ear, urging me to stop. To turn around. To take Dolly back inside.

I shook it off, forcing myself to keep walking. When I reached the dumpster, I flung the lid open, staring into the dark, reeking void below. With a grimace, I tossed Dolly inside, hearing the muffled thud as she hit the bottom, then slammed the heavy lid shut with a sense of finality.

As I walked back to the house, a small but persistent voice in my mind whispered that this wasn’t over. But I pushed it down, reasoning that we’d done the right thing. Dolly was gone. Our daughter would be upset, but with some time, she’d move on.

The next morning, when our daughter woke up, her eyes darted around the room, searching, and she quickly realized Dolly was missing. Her face fell, and she looked up at me, desperation clouding her eyes. But this time, she was different. It was as though something in her understood, resigned and hurt. She didn’t throw a tantrum. She didn’t scream or demand Dolly back. She just sighed, shoulders slumped, and went about getting ready for school with a defeated sort of sadness.

“Promise to be good, okay?” I said, brushing her hair out of her face as she sat at the breakfast table. She nodded, though her gaze was fixed somewhere distant, somewhere I couldn’t follow.

After we got her on the bus and my wife headed to work, I finally allowed myself to relax. Maybe we’d done it, I thought. Maybe we’d finally won the battle.

I made myself a coffee, settled into my office, and powered up my laptop, planning to get some work done in the quiet house. The familiar hum of the computer and the routine of logging into emails and files felt comforting, ordinary. I let myself get lost in it, ignoring the lingering memories of the past few days, trying to embrace the calm.

But then, just as I was settling in, I heard it: a soft, drawn-out creak, like someone slowly pushing the door open. 

My heart froze. I looked up from my screen, eyes darting to the door. It was open, just a crack, though I distinctly remembered shutting it when I’d sat down.

“Hello?” I called, my voice barely more than a whisper, straining to listen for any sound in return. Nothing.

A chill ran down my spine as I pushed back from my desk, rising slowly, my eyes locked on that narrow sliver of the door, as if expecting something to appear there. I took a cautious step forward, reaching out to push the door wider, my breath caught in my throat.

And that’s when I saw it.

Sitting there, just outside my office, was Dolly.

She was propped up in the hallway, her button eyes fixed on the door, her head tilted just slightly, as if she were studying me. That stitched smile, wider than I remembered, curved in an expression that was almost… triumphant.

I stumbled back, feeling my stomach twist as that dreadful realization settled over me. I’d thrown her away. I’d *seen* her hit the bottom of that dumpster. But here she was, back in my house, waiting, like she’d never left.

Dolly sat there, covered in dirt, grime, and bits of garbage clinging to her black dress, her button eyes still fixed on me. For a moment, I could only stare, paralyzed by disbelief and dread. I took a step back, not even noticing the wall behind me until my shoulders hit it. I had thrown her away—*I had seen her at the bottom of that dumpster*. And yet, here she was, sitting on my hallway floor, filthy and somehow more sinister than ever.

Then, before I could even process what I was seeing, Dolly began to rise. Her small body lifted into the air, hovering just above the floor. The air felt thick, almost electric, like the whole house was holding its breath. I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. 

Then, in a rush, a series of images flashed through my mind. Terrible, twisted visions filled my head—screaming faces, dark, tangled forests, and a sense of looming, inescapable dread. The world around me seemed to fade away, swallowed by shadows. My vision blurred, and in the next instant, I was no longer standing in my hallway.

I was in a forest, a dense, suffocating darkness pressing down on me from all sides. My heart pounded in my chest as I ran, my legs pumping through thick underbrush. My feet stumbled over roots and rocks, my lungs burning as I gasped for air. It was like being inside the worst kind of nightmare, but the terror was too real, too sharp to dismiss as mere fantasy. Something was behind me—*chasing* me.

I risked a glance over my shoulder, and my blood ran cold. A massive beast, towering and monstrous, loped through the shadows, its movements fluid but unnatural, as if its joints were barely holding together. It looked like a wolf, but larger than any wolf I’d ever seen, with a gaping maw that stretched grotesquely across its face, almost as if it were barely attached by a thin hinge of jaw. Its eyes burned a bright, unsettling red, like twin buttons sewn deep into its skull, and its body was held together with thick, fraying threads, giving it a twisted, stitched appearance that reminded me horribly of Dolly.

The beast let out a growl, and the sound was like a thousand voices, guttural and inhuman. I stumbled, my legs giving out beneath me as I crashed to the forest floor. The rancid smell of decay filled the air as the creature loomed over me, its hot, foul breath washing over my face. It was like staring into the face of a nightmare made real, a vision of pure, unfiltered terror.

I tried to push myself up, to run, but the beast was too fast. It lowered its massive head, baring rows of jagged, yellowed teeth, each one as sharp as a dagger. I braced my arms against its maw, desperate to hold it back, but the beast was impossibly strong. Black, oily ichor dripped from its mouth, splattering onto my arms and chest, the stench nearly choking me.

“*This isn’t real!*” I shouted, my voice breaking with desperation. “*Leave me alone!*”

But the creature’s glowing red eyes narrowed, and I felt a crushing weight as it bore down on me. Its teeth sunk into my shoulder, sending a wave of agony tearing through my body. I screamed, the pain sharp and cold, a raw fire spreading through my veins. I could feel its teeth tearing into me, feel the slick heat of blood as it spilled down my side.

With a surge of frantic energy, I brought my knee up, slamming it into the beast’s chest, trying to shove it back. But it barely budged. The creature’s maw twisted, a sick, twisted semblance of a grin, its red button eyes glinting with something almost… playful.

“*Wake up! WAKE UP!*” I yelled, every ounce of my mind focused on breaking free of this nightmare. I was trapped, I knew it, but I couldn’t give up. Images of my daughter, my wife, flashed before my eyes, filling me with a fierce determination. I couldn’t let this thing win. I couldn’t let it keep me here.

With a final scream, I pushed against the creature, throwing every ounce of strength I had into one last desperate shove. My body ached, my mind felt splintered, but I focused on them—on my family—on getting back to them. The creature’s grip loosened, if only slightly, and I clawed at the ground, digging my fingers into the dirt as I struggled to pull myself free.

I kept fighting, clinging to that small, stubborn spark of hope. And then, with a sudden, blinding flash, the forest disappeared. 

I found myself back in the hallway, Dolly lying lifeless on the ground in front of me. My head was spinning, still trapped somewhere between the nightmare forest and reality. But one sensation cut through the fog: a searing pain on my chest. I pressed my hand to it, feeling the strange, raw heat radiating from beneath my shirt.

With trembling hands, I pulled my shirt over my head and looked down. My skin was marked with thick, jagged scars—pale and twisted, like they’d been there for years. They traced the spot where the beast had sunk its teeth, a brutal reminder of what I had just endured, or maybe… *survived*.

I looked down at Dolly, her button eyes gazing blankly up at me, her face filled with that eerie, stitched grin. Rage bubbled up inside me, pushing past the confusion and horror of what had just happened. Enough was enough. This doll had wormed its way into my life, into my daughter’s mind, and I couldn’t let it haunt us any longer.

Without another thought, I scooped her up and strode to the garage. I grabbed a can of kerosene, nearly spilling it in my haste, and snatched a box of matches we kept for family fires in the backyard. Today, we’d be having a fire of a different kind.

The backyard was quiet, almost too quiet, as I made my way to the fire pit. I threw Dolly in, her soft body crumpling against the grate, and stuffed a few pieces of old newspaper around her. The doll’s face stared up at me, an almost pleading look in her button eyes. And then, out of nowhere, I felt it—*hesitation*. A nagging, sick feeling gnawed at me, a tiny voice in my head begging me to stop, like I was about to destroy something important, something I should cherish.

It was absurd, but the feeling was almost overwhelming, like Dolly herself was reaching into my mind, whispering to me, making me doubt.

*No*, I told myself. *She’s nothing. Just a doll.*

I shook off the creeping doubt, forcing my hands to steady as I unscrewed the kerosene cap and doused her, watching as the liquid soaked into her fabric, darkening the black dress and matting her tangled hair. With one last breath, I struck a match and, without hesitating further, tossed it in.

The flames roared to life, but instead of the usual red and orange, they flickered a strange, dark purple, licking over Dolly’s body with an otherworldly glow. I watched, transfixed, as her face seemed to contort within the flames, her button eyes bulging slightly, her smile twisting as if alive, fighting against the fire’s embrace. But I held firm, rooted to the spot, determined to watch until there was nothing left but ashes.

I sat there by the fire pit, ignoring the urgent pings of work emails and notifications from my laptop still inside. None of it mattered. Not right now. I stayed there, keeping vigil until the doll was nothing more than charred scraps, the purple flames fading into smoldering embers.

Hours later, when it was time to pick up my daughter from school, I finally stood up, feeling a strange mixture of relief and exhaustion. Dolly was gone, nothing more than a burnt heap. But the scars on my chest tingled, reminding me of the nightmare I couldn’t quite shake.

When I picked up my daughter from school that afternoon, she came running toward me, her face lighting up with that familiar, heartwarming grin. It was as if the past few weeks—the tantrums, the outbursts, the strange fixation on Dolly—had never happened. She wrapped her arms around my waist, her voice bubbling with excitement.

“Daddy! Guess what? I got a gold star on my spelling test! And we made clay animals in art today. Mine’s a bunny. I’ll bring it home to show you tomorrow!”

I hugged her back, feeling a weight lift from my shoulders. It was like having my little girl back, the bright, happy child I’d known before Dolly came into our lives. The darkness that had hung over her seemed to have vanished, leaving no trace, no lingering shadows. She didn’t ask about Dolly. She didn’t even seem to notice the doll was gone.

That night, as we sat down for dinner, she chattered about her day, telling us all the little details we’d missed, her laughter filling the house with warmth that had been absent for far too long. My wife and I exchanged relieved glances, finally allowing ourselves to believe that it was over.

Later, after our daughter was asleep, I told my wife everything. The nightmare in the forest, the scars on my chest, the way Dolly had been lying in the hallway, filthy and somehow… waiting. I explained how I’d taken her to the fire pit, how I’d watched the doll burn with those strange purple flames, staying there until I was sure every last piece of her was gone.

My wife listened, her expression shifting from shock to disbelief. I could tell she was skeptical, and who could blame her? I wasn’t sure I’d believe it myself if I hadn’t seen it all firsthand. But in the end, she squeezed my hand, her lips curving into a soft smile.

“Well, real or not,” she said, “I’m just glad that thing is gone. Our daughter’s back, and that’s what matters.”

I nodded, feeling the scars on my chest itch slightly under my shirt, something that will always remind me of the nightmare I’d lived through. But as I looked down the hall, hearing my daughter’s soft breathing from her room, I knew that we were finally safe.

Dolly was gone. Our daughter was free. And, for the first time in weeks, our home felt like ours again.

I started compounded semiglutide in June, after I finally got a doctor to believe me something was wrong with my body (I was gaining on average 3 lbs a week despite diet and exercise). They suspected PCOS, but my hormones were actually fairly in line (so the 3 years I spent trying to balance them was not for nothing). But, I was found to be pre diabetic, have the start of fatty liver disease and very low in vitamin b12 and d. I’ve been supplementing the b and d. I initially lost 20 lbs in the first 3 months and repeated blood work that showed liver was almost back to normal and no longer pre-diabetic. But, my weight has been stalled 3 months. I did a weight loss challenge at the gym the last 8 weeks and in that time I did lose 1% body fat and did gain a little muscle which could account for the leveling out. But, I still feel like I should be losing weight a bit faster than I am. I’m curious if other insulin resistant gals have a similar experience. I’m trying to figure out if my body is just doing a ton of healing before I lose? I’m no longer gaining. But I’m still not losing like I should. (I’m also measuring and not seeing changes that way either).  I was slowly building and have gone a bit faster the past month. I’m currently at the equivalent of 1.25 for dosing. 

(I am eating good, healthy foods (occasional treat, but this should not be enough to derail), I limit sugary drinks to 1 homemade coffee per day (with 2T of sugar and half and half) and a glass of apple juice if I need some help pooping, drinking plenty of water, getting enough protein, eating adequate but no excessive calories ( my best friend is an RD so I know I am on track here) working out-including strength training, prioritizing sleep. I have tried different injection sites. 

I’m also trying to decide if I need to start intermittent fasting as well? Would love to hear experiences and thoughts. ",2,1731552429.0,OzempicForWeightLoss,1,0.75,False

I have been dealing with gut issues for a year now. It started with chest pain that caused excessive burping through out the day. So no matter what i ate, I am always burping. Some times my stomach would hurt and i would have to use the bathroom to relieve it. I had an endoscopy done last year and the doc said I have some inflammation to my stomach (diagnosed it as mild gastritis) and they did a biopsy to make sure it’s not h pylori. It came back negative and the doctor said to just keep a clean diet, caffeine sometimes but not every day, no spicy or fatty foods. She gave me PPi’s but i didn’t see much of a significant difference. But I did start to feel better in the sense that i wasn’t as bloated alrhough the  burping never stopped , just decreased. My doc stopped prescribing the medics after i told her I feel better than i did before (not completely though. ) This went on for a year. Recently, i started having coffee every single day and kind of fell off my cleaner diet (i know, im guilty) and for about 3 weeks now, my burping has intensified, and i have pain in my left rib area from time to time. idk if i should be worried or should i just wait it out and see if going back to a better diet will make me feel better.

In the past I have been prescribed different medications like lexapro, zoloft, wellbutrin, prozac, and others. All gave me horrible side effects except for prozac and without prozac I am not sure if I would have made it past 2022. My only hesitation is long-term effects of these drugs. 

The end of 2022 was by far the worst time in my life emotionally. I was truly a broken person. I haven't taken anything since maybe summer of 2023 but I'm thinking I may need something again. I went to a coffee shop today to read and maybe do some job searching but I felt such a rush of anxiety and real negative thoughts I had to leave and immediately call someone. Fundamentally, I think I am a weak person and no amount of exercise or journaling really helps. It sucks to feel this way and rely on a crutch like anti-depressants, but I don't know where else to turn.

I've decided to serve champagne, enough for each person to have 1-2 glasses, but have asked people not to bring any alcohol with them. This is because of my grandmother/mother's behaviour at my neices first birthday where they drank a lot, spilt wine on the carpet and presents and just bad behaviour all round. My mother doesn't have a great relationship with myself and my sisters due to substance and mental health issues and because of how her and my grandmother act when they get together when alcohol is involved, ive decided to only invite my grandmother who I have a pretty good relationship with overall. 

However, she seems to be taking issue with me not allowing her to bring alcohol. I told her I'd 'probably serve some champagne' and the following day she rings me, again asking about bringing alcohol as she 'cant see herself going all afternoon without a drink'. I confirm that I will be serving champagne but don't want anyone bringing any. My husband's family aren't big drinkers and neither are the rest of the people invited. At this point I'm starting to get a bit fed up with the fixation on alcohol when it's about my son and dryly ask her if she's an alcoholic. She tells me 'no but I'm a drinker and I drink everyday, don't you know that?' and saying 'what are the adults supposed to drink, raspberry soft drink!?'.
Fyi I plan on serving champagne, coffee/tea, soft drinks etc.

[Scene: The Griffin living room. Peter, Chris, Meg, Lois, and Stewie are gathered around a shiny new iMac on the table, all looking perplexed.]

Peter: (grumbling) So Lois said we needed a “family computer” for everyone, right? So I got this… this iMac. But where’s the rest of it? It’s just a big, shiny… screen!

Lois: (sighing) Peter, the store guy said it was all-in-one. I thought that meant it was easier to use.

Meg: (rolling her eyes) And yet, it’s already crashed three times while setting it up.

Stewie: (smugly) Yes, behold the marvel of modern technology—an overgrown smartphone with one USB port, cleverly hidden, to keep us all guessing.

Peter: (looking under the screen) Why are all the ports in the back? It’s like a secret code just to plug in a thumb drive. (tries plugging something in, grunts in frustration)

Chris: Why does it need to look so fancy? It’s a computer, not a fashion model.

Meg: (sarcastically) Oh, don’t worry, Chris. Looking good while being useless is totally in right now. Isn’t that right, Stewie?

Stewie: (smirking) Right you are, Meg. Apple’s motto is practically “Style over Substance.” Like buying a Ferrari that only has a gas pedal and no brakes.

[Brian walks in with a dry look, sipping a martini.]

Brian: Let me guess: Peter tried to turn it on without the fingerprint scan.

Peter: What do you mean, “fingerprint scan”? It’s a computer, not my parole officer!

Lois: (nodding, frustrated) And it took me two hours just to set up an account. Why did it ask me what my favorite fruit was?

Stewie: Ah, yes, Apple’s “fruit-themed security.” Only people who can guess the password “banana” get access to the internet.

Meg: (clicking on the screen and frowning) I think I just opened… the music app? Why is it asking me to subscribe just to listen to one song?

Peter: Oh, perfect! Next thing, they’ll charge us to look at our own photos. But hey, at least it’s shiny while it robs us blind!

Lois: (crossing her arms) All I wanted was a simple computer that works. This one just feels like it’s judging me every time I make a mistake.

Brian: Yep, welcome to Apple products. You have to earn their respect just to get the internet.

Stewie: (sarcastically) Ah yes, Apple—the only company that makes you feel worse about your intelligence just for owning one of their products.

[Cutaway Scene: Peter at Starbucks with the huge iMac]

Peter: (whispering, looking around) Okay, I’m going to be the coolest guy in here with my brand-new iMac. Let’s just… uh… (struggles to pull it from the bag, knocking over a cup) …stand out. Yep. Cool as ever. (sits awkwardly with the massive computer on the small coffee shop table)

Barista: (eyeing him suspiciously) Sir, we usually mean laptops.

[End Cutaway, back to the living room]

Chris: (randomly tapping on the iMac screen) Why isn’t it doing anything? Are we… not cool enough for it?

Stewie: (giggling) Clearly. Only people who take it out for $8 lattes and whisper, “It just works” are allowed to use it.

Meg: Well, I think I’m cool enough. (taps it again, and the iMac freezes with a spinning rainbow wheel)

Peter: (groans) Okay, that’s it. (grabs the computer) We’re taking this back. I don’t need to be outsmarted by a computer with a smiley face on the screen.

Lois: (relieved) Oh, thank you, Peter. Next time, we’re going with something normal—like one of those computers with actual buttons.

[Fade out on Peter scratching his head, holding the iMac as the family gathers around, finally agreeing that maybe they should go “button-based” next time.]

Maybe you wanted the masseuse's hands to drift toward intimate parts of your body.

Maybe you enjoy someone else using toys on your private areas.

But it never happened... So, the idea of having someone put all their attention on you sexually like this is what you crave.

With time, patience and attention we can together have a life-changing erotic experience. Nothing is sexier than a woman who is open-minded and in-tune with her body. I enjoy giving an erotic massage to this type of woman. Let's just say that I have a very special set of skills.

We can start by chatting and then meeting for coffee to talk about your desires. Your comfort will come easy as you notice that I am a pure gentleman and that I am trustworthy. I'm a very a clean-cut Italian man with a warm smile and soft yet firm hands. We discuss desire and comforts about what you like and how the massage would proceed.

I know that sometimes having an orgasm takes a lot of work and that sometimes a woman focuses a long-time in order to orgasm. I don't want you to stress or try to concentrate so hard on not losing your focus. Let me help.

I would start with a caring gentle massage, absolutely relaxing your body. Then, my hands will start exploring the places you would always want a masseuse to explore. You're lying on your stomach while I work your legs and getting close to your upper thighs nearing your sweet spot. My soft hands work your inner thighs, teasing and playing. You shift your body so that my hands would get the message and see you getting wet.

I want you to think about this as orgasm therapy of the most erotic kind!

I want you to orgasm with intense pleasure like you feel an entire waterfall going down your body!

I want you to have a feeling of sublime and total pleasure!

Maybe you want more, so I turn you over and start massaging your breasts. You crave more and are now putty in my hands. You close your eyes and wait for my fingers to drift towards your breasts and nipples. My soft fingers are making your nipples hard. I am rubbing and then gently suck on each nipple by taking my time to devour them. My breast and nipple play is intense and builds up over a while. You get even wetter and then suddenly you are on fire. Your sensitive nipples are going to setup for another orgasm to rush through your body.

It's hard to think of anything that feels better than a man's hands, fingers and kisses all over your body. You think about this relaxed and cozy orgasm. Then, you start to think about how you could've come again and again. The whole time you are happy and smiling and in awe of your own naughtiness.

So, if you're interested then please message me and tell me all about yourself by sharing your age, location, ethnicity and what you look like. Thanks!",1,1731551552.0,MassageNearMe,0,1.0,False

It's in the first half of the episode, after the alien heals O’Brien’s shoulder (also the first mention of Miles' kayaking). Beverly and Wesley have a quiet conversation in her quarters over coffee (maybe after dinner?). They’re discussing her mysterious patient, their mutual fondness for him, and Beverly's potential feelings for him. It’s refreshing to see a conversation that isn’t just Beverly worrying, Wesley pushing back, Wesley saves the day, etc. 

Wesley’s genuinely curious and eventually asks if she has feelings for the guy. Beverly doesn’t try to avoid or neutralize the question. She answers honestly, showing real respect for her son’s intelligence and maturity. It’s a small moment but feels like some of the most authentic Beverly-Wesley bonding we get.

30 M here and I can’t stop thinking about this girl that I work with. I might sound werid, but her beauty just makes me fall in love with her everytime I see her lol. I’ll explain the entire thing here:

About 3 months ago, she randomly asked me to help her connect something to the TV. Before that, I can tell she was just fiddling around acting like it wasn’t working. I went up and fixed it in seconds but the way the interaction happened I feel it was to speak to me. After that I bumped into the elevator with her a few times and had small talk and she seemed interested in a way but I didn’t take it on. I then noticed she would come into the area I worked in just to borrow a charger and it seemed like she did it to speak to me again (I might be wrong)

I then noticed when I had small talk with her about her weekend and asked “nice who did you go with for your little trip” she said her boyfriend and after that she stopped talking to me lol. Again, I was a little burned about this and started to think it was maybe just a fad. She then started playing hot and cold games with me. She would constantly walk where the area I worked (even though she never had to because her desk is right at the entrance), she would say hi when we walked by each other in the halls and then she would ignore me and act cold. There was a time she was in the kitchen, with another coworker and when I went to get coffee it was a break of silence and I heard her say “I’m going to go back to my desk now”

I don’t know if she thinks I’m a creep or if I like her but yeah it’s really strange. We had a work party, and I notice she would come really close to me and started playing with her hair, walking back and forth infront of me, and just find every opportunity to be there. There was even a point where I went into a disclosed room and she came in, acting like she’s on the phone. When looked at her she looked at me, looked down and left the room lol. Also that same night, I did try to engage conversation with her and this other co worker that works with her. In seconds, when I can tell it was going to get deep in the convo she said “oh let’s go take pictures” to the other girl lol. I’m not too sure if she’s into me or she’s playing games. I understand she has a boyfriend but who does this? Am I tripping out? I really do like her, and want to be friends but how can I move on. I really think it’s toxic for me.

he is exactly the kind of person i would want to in a relationship with. smart, worldly, caring, generous, fun. he is an absolute angel to me. he sends me food when i’m sick, pays for all of my food, gets me my favorite coffee every time we are together, is extremely physically and verbally affectionate. we started officially dating about 3 weeks ago now and our relationship is already so emotionally passionate and intense. i haven’t had a real relationship like this in years so it’s weird for me. honestly this is probably the only healthy relationship i’ve ever had and im terrified of losing him but he knows nothing about my sugar dating life or G and im terrified of what he would think of me if he found out. i love him and i don’t want to hurt him but i don’t know what to do. i don’t want to stop sugar dating. i don’t want to give up the money and the freedom but i absolutely do not want him to find out about it. he’s such. conventional guy. he has a great job working for some sort of legal consultant company, a great group of friends that all have normal jobs, and doesn’t really do anything off the beaten path. i think i could continue to do it and date him simultaneously without it interfering with the relationship but i just know he wouldn’t be ok with that. he just wouldn’t understand it at all. he probably has never even considered the possibility that i would be doing something like that either cause it’s just not a part of his world.

i’ve still been doing it behind his back a little bit but ive slowed down a lot. i know im playing with fire. every time im with him im terrified he’s going to go on my phone and see a text from G or something but im so so conflicted. i feel extremely guilty about lying to him but i don’t know what a better option is. maybe i just need to end the relationship but i don’t want to lose him.

She’s been “running into” me everywhere for years, and it’s honestly exhausting.

For context: My ex and I broke up over a decade ago. We were on and off for five years, and our relationship had its issues. He started seeing his now-wife while we were together and eventually broke up with me to pursue her. I’ve respected that from the moment he ended things (and ran off on a bicycle, which is ridiculous but paints the picture of who we’re dealing with here).

They’re now married with a child—around 3? I try not to track their lives. I’ve been trying to move on by avoiding mutual spots and sticking to new routines, but his wife keeps showing up in places I frequent, like my favorite coffee shop and even an outdoor tai chi class I used to go to. She stood nearby a couple of times in a way that felt off, so I eventually quit the class because it creeped me out.

I work in a job where I’m walking around the neighborhood at predictable times, and she always seems to show up where I am, making it hard to feel at ease during my workday.

This has gone from strange to unsettling. At first, it was little things—liking and unliking my Instagram posts late at night, poking me on my long abandoned Facebook account, or posting random photos of my apartment building. It escalated to in-person run-ins. I tried to brush it off as coincidence, but the frequency of these encounters makes it hard to ignore. I even reached out to both of them years ago when it was just online behavior (screenshots exist, but I won’t share those). She brushed it off as “Lol, honest mistake,” and he told me to “move on.” After that, I noticed a burner Instagram account, which I believe was hers, always watching my stories. When I blocked it, the account was deleted the same day.

I feel like I’m being gaslit into thinking I’m imagining things, but these in-person encounters are so frequent (sometimes daily) that it’s affecting my peace of mind. I’ve tried everything to avoid this situation: changing routines, quitting tai chi, and even avoiding friendships with people who live on their block. She’s still there, and it feels like she has control over my life, and I don’t understand why.

For the record, I’ve been nothing but respectful of their relationship. The oddest part? My ex only acknowledges me with a polite wave when his wife isn’t around. If she’s with him, he looks at the ground and seems… sad, I guess? But that’s not my business.

Some context: I wasn’t a perfect girlfriend, and I don’t look the way I did when we were together. Life’s taken a toll, and my appearance isn't my main priority. I doubt this is jealousy; I’ve never interfered in their lives. I’ve never even had a conversation with her—just casual nods when we pass by.

So, what gives? Does anyone have insights into what her motives might be? How do I set boundaries with someone who isn’t technically doing anything wrong but has such a strange hold over my peace of mind? I can’t change my work route, and I really wish working from home was an option.

Thanks for any insights!

How many hours a week? What appliances do you swear by (for me it's my  Ecovacs T30s combo)? What are some hacks that have helped you get stuff done efficiently and effectively?

I'm living solo in an apartment with a kitchen, a bathroom, a tiny living room, and a bedroom. Work keeps me pretty busy, so I don't have a lot of time for cleaning.The bathroom's the toughest for me. After every shower, I use a squeegee to wipe down the shower walls. I wipe down the sink with Clorox wipes once a week, and do a deep clean on the toilet and mop the floor once a month.

In the kitchen, thanks to my dishwasher, I just load it up every night and let it run, then put the dishes away in the morning. Every night, I vacuum the kitchen countertop with the handheld part of my Ecovacs T30s combo (using the finest attachment) and then wipe it down. For the floors in the living room and bedroom, I rely on the T30s robot vacuum. It's easy to control with my voice. I usually set it to vacuum and mop in that order, and it starts up every night when I get home. While it's doing that, I use the T30s handheld vac (with a medium-sized head) to clean the coffee table and desks. I wash the sofa covers once a month, or sooner if there's a spill. I make the bed every morning, spray some room spray before bed each night, and wash the sheets whenever I do laundry, which is usually once a week.

1gquev7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1gquev7/i_work_as_a_security_guard_in_a_secret_government/," I work as a security guard in a secret government facility, and this is what happened (Part 1) ","Buster growled softly, baring his teeth at me as he stood in defiance. His stance rigid and unyielding, his tail stiff, and ears pinned back - he watched my every move with alert eyes.

My 3-year-old German shepherd had intuitively figured out the prospect of an upcoming bath when he saw me reach for the towel, and decided to give me a hard time over it.

“I know buddy. I am not happy about it either. But I will make it quick. I promise,” I tried to reason, holding up both hands to reassure him.

‘But it’s not even been a week…’ I could almost imagine him saying those exact words to me when he growled back in protest.

“You’re right...But listen, man. You’re dirty. I can feel your presence from here,” I said, standing ten feet away and pretending to cover my nostrils with my finger.

Buster, of course, didn’t care and continued to defy without hesitation.

I put my hands on my hip and sighed. My glance immediately shifted to a hose attached to a tap outside my quarters.

“Tell you what. I’ll make it worth your while. You don’t mind the jet spray, right? In fact, you even tolerate it sometimes,” I said, pointing to the hose located only a few feet away.

“How about a little cooperation now, and I’ll make you your favorite meal a little later?” I asked him, while reaching out to pick a can of chicken liver from the kitchen.

As I dangled the can in my hand, I could see it slowly chipping away at his resolve, his mind grappling with the pros and cons of my new proposal.

A moment later, Buster barked at me twice and slowly made his way out of the house. He sat by the garden tap, ready to receive his bath. 

I took a handful of lotion and began to rub it against his torso to remove all the muck and grime that was sticking to his body.  We had been quite busy lately, guarding the base and conducting multiple patrols along the perimeter every day. The rain a few hours ago certainly didn't help matters, with Buster leaping over puddles of water and actively rolling in the mud to escape the desert heat. I had to use a brush to remove the layers of dirt that had caked all over his body.

It’s been a strange week, to say the least. The days were busy but peaceful, while the nights brought scattered, random sounds. Their origins were a mystery, as they appeared not to originate from the base. But I wasn’t too worried about it, not yet anyway.

There is an air base located a couple of hours away from the facility, and it wasn’t unusual for them to conduct sorties at odd hours in the night. I assumed they were probably testing out some new technology.  

My colleague Joe thought the same thing as well. But we couldn’t take any chances, and we both had a job to do. So we conducted regular patrols around the base just as a precautionary measure.

But deep down, I felt something nagging at me, like I was being watched by someone or something. I couldn’t exactly put it into words.

For a second, I wondered if Buster too felt the same way when I saw him suddenly lift his head up, listening intently with his ears up in attention.

I quickly turned back to check if there was anybody standing behind me, but I found no one. When I turned around to face him again, I saw him looking up at the night sky, his gaze focused and unwavering.  

“What’s it buddy? You see something?” I asked him as I cleared away the foam from his face. Moments went by slowly. And then, just like that, as if nothing had happened, he put his head down and began pawing my leg, urging me to finish his bath. I sighed again and turned on the hose, to wash off all the soap.

He finally looked presentable and I have to admit, his coat glistened beautifully under the moonlight.

Before I could reach for his towel, Buster swiftly moved in to close the gap between us and looked me in the eye dead serious. He then shook his body vigorously, much like a wet dog trying to rid itself of wetness, and trotted off without bothering to look back.

I laughed out loud as I sat there, drenched in water. I knew I should have seen that coming. However, my smile quickly faded, as it also reminded me of Jessica, my ailing wife.

Before another thought could take shape in my mind, I heard a familiar voice blare across the radio.

“Mike, I need you down here. Get to the post quick.”

It was my colleague Joe and I replied back in the affirmative. I quickly grabbed my gear and signaled Buster to follow after me.

When I reached the post, I saw Joe standing there armed with his rifle. As a seasoned war veteran with two tours under his belt, Joe was a dangerous man and not to be trifled with. But he was also compassionate and wise beyond his years.

“What’s up Joe?” I inquired, as I approached him near the entrance of the base.

“I am not sure yet.  I thought I heard something at a distance. It could well be nothing.” he replied, after a brief pause.

‘Well, we’ve had a lot of that going around all week’, I thought to myself.

He then turned around to look at me. “I want you to run a perimeter sweep first. Then go on patrol again. Take Buster with you” he said, before heading back to his post.

I started the jeep and drove out towards the perimeter. The engine hummed softly as I navigated the rough terrain, with Buster sitting alertly beside me. After finding nothing suspicious during my initial sweep, I decided to broaden my search radius.

A mile into the drive, Buster suddenly started barking, prompting me to stop the jeep immediately. He leaped onto the ground and dashed towards a boulder located a short distance away. I picked up my rifle and cautiously followed after him.

When I reached the spot, I keyed the mic attached to my shirt and said, ""Boss, you need to come see this.""

I knew he wasn’t going to be happy about leaving the guard post unmanned, but I thought he would prefer to come and inspect this himself.

Joe arrived ten minutes later, parking his vehicle next to mine. He walked towards the boulder overlooking a small pond, and switched on his torch to get a better look at the skeletal remains of an animal dumped nearby. Three other animal remains lay next to it, all appearing to be in a similar condition.

“These look like coyotes, probably stopping by to drink water from the pond before they were killed,” he observed, his voice expressing concern. “Did you find them like this?”

“Yes”, I replied. “And they weren’t here when I drove through the same place this morning. I thought it was quite odd to be honest, to find four of them out here all at once in the middle of the desert, that too at this hour.”

Joe simply nodded in agreement.

“What sort of creature do you think did this Joe?”

“I mean it must have a ravenous appetite to chew every sinew of flesh from the bone, and lick it this clean.” I said, leaning in take another look.

“Do you think it could be the Chupacabra or something similar?” I continued, knowing fully well my question was a bit far-fetched, but I had to still get it off my chest.

Joe finally stood up, switched off his torch, and looked around the vast open desert in quiet contemplation.

“This is in fact the fifth sighting in less than a week, Mike, and all have occurred in close proximity to secure government installations. The one before this was even stranger, and happened near a military base, where an old buddy of mine continues to serve.”

“He told me in that instance, the remains belonged to a dog. There were no signs of flesh or connecting tissue from the nasal region to the abdominal section, while the region spanning from the abdominal cavity to the tail bone was left fully intact. The whole thing was carried out with surgical precision, and drew morbid praise from even the medic back at the base.”

""But how is that even possible? What are you suggesting, Joe?"" I asked, surprised by the tone of my own voice and my inability to hide my disappointment upon hearing about it for the first time.

“This is not a hunt for prey, Mike. This is a hunt for attention. Somebody is trying to make a point. And I’d say they are accomplishing their objective.” Joe said.

When we got back to the base, Joe updated the command centre about the new developments. I headed back to my quarters and lay down on my bed. The exhaustion washed over me and I immediately drifted to sleep.

*I looked at my Mickey Mouse watch. The time was 5:36 PM. I was licking my ice cream while sitting next to my mom in the car. To my right, was my 4 year old cousin Henry who was fast asleep on his mother’s lap.*

*In the front, my dad was driving the car with his brother seated next to him. Then a truck from the opposite side suddenly came in our lane, and rammed into our vehicle causing it to turn turtle.*

*With great difficulty, I managed to extricate myself and pulled my cousin out from the wreckage as well. And then suddenly, the car exploded and went up in flames….*

I opened my eyes and realized I was still in bed. The same dream had come and gone a thousand times before. It has become a constant part of my life ever since I was a 9-year-old kid.

I slowly got off the bed and found my head hurting. I had barely slept since last night’s excitement, and my mood was already beginning to turn foul.

Buster was already awake. I gently patted him on the head as I walked into the kitchen to put a kettle of water on the boil, and turned on the TV.

My attention immediately shifted towards the news. There was a nuclear explosion in Russia in a small town that was just a couple of hours away from Moscow. The details regarding the explosion were still shrouded in speculation.

“Just the kind of news to start the day,”I groaned as I reached for a nearby chair in the kitchen.

‘But what could have caused this?’ I thought to myself a little later, and hoped the damage there was minimal.

I then looked at the clock and set about getting ready for work. I showered, ate my breakfast, and was out the door by 8, with a hot cup of coffee in hand. Buster raced ahead to get to the guard post.

Joe had already completed his shift, and was waiting for me to relieve him of his duties. We high-fived as usual, and he began to walk back to his quarters. I settled into my chair, and made an entry in the logbook.

My name is Michael Armesto, a 30-year-old security guard working for a secret government installation located in an obscure area in the hot Nevada desert. The facility is centered around a medium-sized building occupying 7,000 square feet of space.

A 10-meter-high wired fence had been erected around the base to provide added protection. There was nothing else around the facility for miles, with the exception of a few boulder fields and mountains in the distance.

For over 5 years now, my colleague Joe and I have been working in shifts to ensure the guard post is manned at all times. When compared to other secret government bases, the security requirements here are not as stringent. And yet, neither Joe nor I ever had any clue about the kind of work being done here.

Every day, like clockwork, a bus carrying 25 people would arrive at the facility at 9:00 AM sharp. I had to open the gates to let them through, once the customary security checks were performed.

These people always wore lab coats and looked like scientists. They would work in the facility until 5:00 PM, and leave by the same bus at the end of the day. In all that time, they never once smiled or waved at me. It was as if their bosses had strictly informed them to not even initiate eye contact with people outside their circle.

Anyway, I never took offense to any of that. My job was to provide security to the facility, and I was doing that to the best of my ability.

As I sat back in my chair, ready to take another sip of coffee, my phone began to ring. It was from the hospital, and I answered it. A minute later, I called Joe and asked him to stand in for me. He immediately understood.

When he arrived at the guard post, I apologized for the inconvenience and Joe simply nodded with a reassuring smile.

As I was about to climb into my jeep, I pointed my finger at Buster and said, “STAY.”.

“Take him with you Mike. She will be happy to see him” Joe said quickly intervening.

“But Boss, I don’t want to leave you here alone after last night.” I protested.

Joe waved his hand dismissively. “Get going Mike. That’s an order.”

“And don’t worry about me. I’ll be fine. Go see Jess and tell her I am rooting for her,” he said, before walking back to the guard post.

I put a leash on Buster and climbed into the jeep with him. I started the vehicle and began driving towards the city to check on my wife Jessica. She was receiving treatment for lung cancer at St Mary’s Hospital, which was a 5 hour drive from the base.

Jess had never smoked once in her life, and for her to go through all this hardship really broke my heart. I would have normally liked to stay by her side during this crisis, but I could not afford the cost of treatment on my own. Thankfully, the insurance from my government job so far helped me cover most of the medical expenses.

After arriving at the hospital, I headed straight to her room and found her with tubes attached to her mouth. She was heavily sedated and looked like she was in pain.

Buster was standing by the door looking glum. He could see that Jess was unwell. Buster came into my life as a surprise birthday gift from Jess, and he has been a part of our family ever since. The people working at the hospital regularly allowed him inside the premises, knowing fully well that his presence always helped to uplift her spirits.

I came to know from the doctor that Jess had suffered a heart attack due to long term COVID complications. While she was stable and out of danger for now, she did need to undergo an emergency surgery within the next 3 days. The surgery alone would cost $30,000, and that was not covered by my insurance policy.

I pulled Buster by the leash to tell him it was time to go, but he kept resisting. He wanted to sit by her side for some time, even though she was unconscious and unable to acknowledge his presence. So, I too pulled up a chair and sat beside him. It immediately brought back happy memories of our marriage.

We used to spend our summers going on long drives, visiting natural parks, or idly sitting by the beach, enjoying good food and playing all kinds of sports. Jess and I would also often embark on scenic routes, with no particular destination in mind, allowing the road to guide us towards hidden gems.

Whether it's a visit to a historic village or a hike through a lush green forest, all the shared experiences helped strengthen our bond as a family.

The two of us also enjoyed using Buster to pull pranks on each other. Whenever Jess gave him a bath, she would command Buster to go ‘Shake’ in front of me and I would get drenched in water, leading to fits of laughter all around. It was one of her favorite pranks.

So when I saw my wife on the bed with tubes attached to her mouth, I got the reality check I needed. I stood up from my chair and yanked harder at his leash; he didn’t resist this time and followed after me.

I walked out of the hospital feeling a bit dazed. As I started to drive back to the base, my mind was busy trying to come up with solutions. I had only $2000 in my bank account, and that clearly wasn’t enough.

‘Maybe I could contact an official from the government and apply for a loan?’ I thought to myself. I kept driving while mulling on the best course of action.

Then, at a certain point, I suddenly snapped to my senses and immediately stopped the car. I had been driving for over 4 hours now. It was 7 in the evening, and night had already fallen.

Yet, I could not spot the base in the distance. Usually, by this time, the floodlights would have been turned on, and the facility would be easily visible for miles.

Instead, all I could see up ahead was pitch-black darkness. Something was wrong.

I tried calling Joe on his phone, but he was unreachable. I pressed the gas pedal and drove as fast as I could.

When I finally reached the facility, the situation looked much worse than I had feared. The entrance gate was left half open, with no one manning the guard post. The entire building just sat there in the darkness with no power. I tried calling on Joe’s number again. No response.

I then called Joe’s boss, who was stationed in Carson City, to inform him of the situation and possibly request reinforcements. He was unreachable as well.

‘What on earth is going on?’ I asked myself. This was completely bewildering on so many levels.

I slowly drove up to the base, and stopped the jeep a short distance away from the front gate. I wanted to be able to make a quick exit, if things turned hostile. I took a torch light from the dashboard and unfastened my sidearm from the holster. After getting down from the vehicle, I softly whistled towards Buster to follow me.

When I walked past the gate and checked the guard post, I saw a body lying face down on the floor. From a distance, it was difficult to identify the person clearly, but as I got closer I recognized Joe’s uniform. I ran towards him and turned him around and got the shock of my life. I stumbled back in fear and hit the floor hard.

I don’t know what they did to Joe.

But he was lying there dead! Very dead!

It was like he had been zapped or electrocuted. The only thing that was remaining of him was his skeleton. Not an ounce of flesh was visible on his body. And yet his uniform looked in pristine condition.

‘How is this even possible?’ I asked myself.

It immediately reminded me of the dead coyotes I found on patrol the previous night.

“Could this all be somehow related? Was this an execution? And was this carried out be the same group of people?” I wondered.

Joe’s rifle was still there, leaning against the wall. I holstered my sidearm and picked up his rifle. I checked the magazine. He hadn’t fired a single shot.

I then turned on the tactical light and started moving towards the government facility. No one could enter this building until they had a high level of clearance, and every person who had clearance, was issued an electronic key card to gain access. So I was shocked to see the door was left ajar here as well.

Before entering, I headed back to check the junction box. The darkness was making me paranoid and I wanted to see if there was anything I could do to fix it first. When I reached the box, I discovered that the power had been deliberately shut down.

I turned it back on, and the entire place lit up like a Christmas tree.

But the whole facility wore a deserted look. The bus that was usually used to ferry the scientists was still parked at the parking lot.

I doubled back towards the entrance, and slowly entered the building with my rifle pointed forward. This was the first time I was setting foot inside the facility. And if this was supposed to be a top research lab, I wasn’t seeing any signs of it.

The place had been hastily evacuated. There was not a single soul in sight. All I could see was waste paper and computer cables strewn across the floor. Everything else had been cleared out.

Buster then took off on his own, and dashed towards the far end of the building. Something had caught his fancy and I followed after him. He stopped against a large couch and started barking at me.

I looked down and could see something metallic hidden underneath. I stretched my hand to retrieve an aluminum briefcase with blood stains all over it. Someone was obviously holding onto it for dear life, and then tossed it underneath as a last ditch attempt to prevent it from getting into the wrong hands.

‘Did the scientists manage to escape? Or did something bad happen to them, like it happened to Joe?’

‘Could the nuclear explosion in Russia have something to do with this?’

“Are the two countries about to go to war? Is this to be viewed as an escalation,” I wondered.

A hundred questions were going through my mind now, and I had answers to none of them.

I decided to get the hell out of there as quickly as possible. I saw no point in staying, now that Joe was dead and the facility had also been cleared out. I ran back to my jeep, tossed the briefcase in the backseat, and began my drive back to the nearest city I could think of.

Twenty minutes into the drive, I began to get curious about the briefcase, and I had to stop the car to take a look. I switched on the light in my vehicle and opened the briefcase. There was some kind of a telescope inside.

On its base, it bore the insignia of a bright burning Sun with a single eye at it’s center. It also had a name tag attached to it that was labelled Korelo ZX4 – 1969.

The telescope in itself was a strange looking contraption, the likes of which I had never seen before. It was the size of a camcorder, and comfortably fit within the palm of my hand.

There were two identical knobs on either side of the device. The one on the left moved freely clockwise or counter clockwise. It felt similar to those old radio transistors, where you could switch back and forth between stations.

The knob on the right looked the same but had a small pointer attached to it. It had limited range of motion and worked like a switch. Close to the pointer were 3 printed dots, one larger than the other in ascending order. I guess this signified the 3 levels in which this device functioned.

I held the telescope gently in my hand and peered into the eyepiece. With the moon being the only source of light in the desert, I could hardly spot a thing. I then turned the knob on the right, and the device immediately roared to life. I could even feel it mildly vibrating in my hand.

As I peered into the eyepiece again, I now had clear vision of the space all around me. A green display had opened up and was providing clean imagery with stunning levels of detail. I slowly started to turn the knob on the left, and the telescope began to zoom in and out.

I could now clearly see the creatures of the desert ….miles away… coming out their holes …looking for prey. Their heat signatures capturing perfectly… the contours of their own bodies as they moved swiftly across the sand.

As I kept zooming in further, I could also spot the local diner of the nearest town that was more than 50 miles away. I could not only figure out the make and model of cars parked in front of the restaurant, but also read the number plates on them.

And then I looked upwards, pointing the telescope at the night sky, hoping to see the stars a little more clearly. And suddenly everything became obscure. It was like staring at a blank wall.

I moved the telescope away looking confused. Everything looked normal. There was an abundance of stars scattered across the sky, and there were hardly any clouds. I looked into the telescope again, and started zooming back, and my heart suddenly skipped a beat.

Thousands of feet high up in the sky, a large spaceship was hovering mid-air. It was big enough to accommodate an entire football field. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest as I just kept staring at it for several moments.

Then I slowly began to pan the telescope across the skyline, and soon realized that I was in for an even bigger shock! There were at least two more spaceships thousands of miles away. Make no mistake. They were clearly visible as the one I was standing in front of.

‘Ok Mike, What else you got?’ I said out loud to myself.

I then turned my focus back to the ship in front of me, and turned the right knob again.

The second dot got highlighted on screen, and the telescope suddenly zoomed in to reveal the insides of the spaceship.

The unfolding images were a little grainy but still definitive enough to provide sufficient visual quality. It was like an X-ray, CT scan and MRI all rolled into one. As I kept adjusting the left knob to get a clearer visual, I could see a large workstation occupying most of the space inside the ship.

Close to the panel, two people were standing and conversing with each other. They did not look human at all. In fact, they looked like aliens!

By this point, I was already sweating even as the cool winds of the desert were hitting my face, and ruffling my hair. I continued to stare into the telescope completely transfixed. I turned the right knob one more time.

The last big dot got highlighted on screen, and then I suddenly started hearing weird noises. Buster who was keeping silent all this while, let out a soft howl and dug his face into the sand. But the noises didn’t stop. It sounded odd and animal like. Like the garbled speech of someone attempting to speak with a mouthful of water. I realized I was now eavesdropping on the aliens talking amongst themselves.

I think they figured this out as well. Because one of them abruptly stopped speaking, and walked towards a work station, and then punched something on the console.

In a matter of moments, the other alien turned around and took a step forward in my direction. It looked like he was peering down at me, fully aware of my existence. A wry smile appeared on his lips, and I felt a shiver go down my spine.

I immediately switched off the telescope, put it back in the briefcase and ran towards my jeep. Buster followed after me. I decided to get to the nearest town and drove as fast as I could.

1gqucub,https://i.redd.it/5rxomuo91s0e1.jpeg,Update: I Love Swiss Products,"
Recently i posted a topic ""I love swiss products"". I ordered a few of the cheaper items that where recommend and available on Amazon


u/Lanxy & u/whateber2 & u/stwyg & u/attempt9001 & u/aureleio

All of you all recommend the Rex style peeler. I purchased the red one frlm victorinox.  My initial thoughts. On design, it is absolute simplicity. No masted material and ergonomic.  My initial thought when i picked it up was that it almost seemed to light weight. I didn't realize how heavy my Oxo peeler was. I test peeled a potato.  The ergonomics are nice, and they fit in hand nicely.  I think this will stay in my kitchen.

--------

u/b00nish & u/Fun_universe & u/Bakeey & u/Amareldys & u/RedFox_SF & u/mr8unty & u/thelilbinch

You all recommend that I try Ovaltamine (European version) and that it is different from the American version of Ovaltine. Well, you are 100% correctm it's less sweet. He has a slight malty flavor. I made a cup with water, and it was good.  I added 1/2 a spoonful to my coffee. ONG that was brilliant.  I agree that Ovaltamine is the superior product.

-------

u/Unicorn1982 & u/sweet_nasty_things & u/ndbrzl & u/paltrax

You all recommend Aromat. The night when amazon delivered it, I was having oxtail (cowtail) stew. I sprinkled some on a few bites.  It really enhanced the flavor. It reminds me of a seasoning I use called Everglade Seasoning. The next morning, i made over medium eggs for breakfast and sprinkled some on. It was GRRREAT!

------
u/Grand_Public_228

You recommend Caran D'Ache pen. I ordered a red one with a swiss flag. Let's talk about the clicking mechanism or the lack of click. It is buttery smooth. I mean, it's like silk. Barely an audible noise. The Swiss made the clicker so efficient. I am sorry, i hate it. I love super clicky pens. My wife hates when i have clicky pens. I will click a pen over and over. I will say i love the octagon sided aluminum body. It feels really nice. It's definitely a good pen.

u/Unicorn1982 
Offered to send me a Swiss care package and we have DM. I put together one for him. Ill post updates on this in future.  


-----
I purchased a SAK Midnite Manager. It is my first SAK that is only 58mm. This is tiny.  Its also my first SAK with a pen or light. I am excited sbout pen feature. I am going to put this on my keychain. We will.see if it survives EDC usage

### Training
Background:

M34
I’ve been running marathons on and off since 2012, and this was my 8th marathon to date. My previous times are:

* 2012 - 3:45:35
* 2013 - 3:26:18
* 2014 - 3:34:46
* 2017 - 3:14:02
* 2019 - 2:58:09
* 2022 - 2:48:41
* 2024 - 3:08:48 (Boston)
* 2024 - 2:44:06

My goal at Boston earlier this year was to hit sub 2:45. Overly ambitious in hindsight, but I was certain I had the fitness to pull it off. My hamstring flared up a few weeks out during one of my last threshold sessions, and it was touch and go all the way up the gun. I thought it was an injury that I could power through, but alas, I was humbled within the first 8 miles. The pounding on the downhills in those first miles completely undid my left side, and I spent the next 18 miles battling for my life. I knew I was doing damage…but it was Boston and I had fought for so long to get there I WAS NOT going to DNF. I hobbled across the finish line at 3:08, twenty minutes slower than my PR, but ten times harder in effort. I felt proud of my ability to grit through the pain, but disappointed I was not able to prove my fitness to myself and others.

After Boston I did about 6 weeks of PT, and made a fairly speedy recovery. (Dry needling was a miracle for me). Fortunately I was able to do some decent mileage after about 3 weeks and so I didn’t lose much fitness in the process. I focused a lot on working strength routines into my training program going forward which became a huge help IMO.

The goal was to steadily and safely get back to a good volume. By mid May I was back in the 40’s, and pushing into 50+ by June. 

In July I ran a 17 second 5k PR (17:05) and was super happy with where my fitness was trending.  Hit 60mpw a few times in July, but the real training block began in August.

I jumped into Pfitz 12/70 program but modified it to 14 weeks. The reason being is I had a planned trip to Europe smack dab in the middle of the two peak weeks. I knew I wasn’t going to accomplish that while on vacation, so I started my program two weeks early, and just added two buffer weeks while I was away.  I managed to maintain decent mileage with a workout or two during those two weeks.

Overall, it was the most consistent block I’ve ever had. I think I missed 1 total workout in 14 weeks and that was due to being tremendously hungover from Oktoberfest in Munich :)

Key workouts went well. I had a few blow ups in the heat where I didn’t scale my effort for the temps, but I didn’t let that get me down. MP efforts were all on point. My last workout was a 20 miler with 3x4m @ MP with one mile float. My MP miles averaged to about 6:08! It was at that point I was thinking that maybe 2:42 was achievable. I was unable to get in any real tune up races due to my schedule, but instead I ran a solo 10k time trial on a track 3 weeks out and hit a 35:20.

### Pre-race
Leading up to race day I did a 2 day carb load of 600+ grams. Usually I dread the carb load, but my appetite was ferocious and it went smooth with little discomfort. Pop Tarts and Red Bull were my friend.

RACE MORNING:

Woke up at 5AM. Breakfast was a bagel w/PB + honey, banana, coffee, and half of a Maurten 320 mix. My hotel was 2 blocks from the start corral so I chilled inside pooping in my room until about 30 minutes before the gun. 30 min before I took a Maurten Caf100, 500mg Tylenol, and headed out the door.

### Race

I had a lot more pacing issues in the first 5 miles than expected. I could not find 6:15 for the life of me. My first 5k was slow at 19:50 (6:23/m), but I tried to stay calm knowing I had a long race ahead to chip away at my time.

Miles 6-12 I really settled in and hit a groove. Felt super comfortable, had decent packs to run with, and felt I had plenty of energy to start picking up the pace. Confidence was through the roof. I was going to hit sub 2:45 no problem.

Hit halfway at 1:22:21 and had a mild panic attack. “Oh boy, you can’t go any slower than this if you want to get sub 2:45. But I reminded myself that my first 5k was slow, and that I still had a lot of opportunity to pick up the pace and bank some time.

Miles 15-18 had some good downhills that I really tried to hammer. Dropped a 6:10/avg 5k here which was my fastest 5k split in the whole race.

18 on was a GRIND. Suddenly I was on an island, and the headwinds had picked up. I could feel myself straining against the slightest headwind, and I think it had a profound effect on my mental. I kept telling myself “just get to mile 20 and then see what you’re made of” I was fully prepared to open up and rip the last 10k.

My legs were dead in the last 10k. I was still straining in headwinds wondering where everyone around me went. Finally, I got passed by a taller runner than me (I’m 6’3) who was also quite built…and I just slotted in right behind him. I stared at the back of this dudes head and drafted off him for probably 2 miles. Eventually I surged past him and kicked solo for the last two miles. Getting back into downtown, the crowds thickened, and I had a surge of adrenaline take my stumpy legs to the finish line.

For fueling I had 50ish grams of drink mix in bottle, Gel 100’s at 4, 8(caf), 12, 15 (caf), 18, and 21  Water at about 4 of the stops, and Nuun at mile 23.

### Post-race

I’m super proud of this race and for getting redemption after my poor showing at Boston. Looking back, I think I could have gone 1 minute faster if I paced my first 5k better and didn’t deal with so much wind and solo running. My stretch goal was sub 2:42, but I think sub 2:43 was doable.

Not sure what my plan is going forward. I know I’d like to run New York (which I will likely do next fall) and probably Berlin after that. I can see stacking some more blocks and getting under 2:40…maybe into the mid 2:30’s…who knows?
