What are my options,"Had a rough year with prostatitis and EOE / asthma diagnosis. I have a ton of allergies causing anxiety. Finally started seeing a counselor  who told me to keep a journal. My wife and I are seeing a lot of ADHD symptoms. I always suspected I had it but never diagnosed. 

I saw a nurse practitioner yesterday for pre surgery blood test and I mentioned what I found. He referred me for testing but told me it will be a seriously long wait. He can't prescribe meds for it but my normal family doctor can. I see him in March. Wondering if I can convince him to prescribe low dose stimulants to try? I don't want to scare him away thinking im only trying to get high or something. I just want this internal feeling of fatigue type pressure to go away so I can get things done for once in my life. I would also like to read a book without drifting off, daydreaming about something else every other paragraph. Also sick of trying to hide zoning out during 1 on 1 conversations. Im 45 and you would think I'd have my life figured out by now but I've learned to cope. Could never hold a job long term. Always dreaded going to sleep which meant my fun was over until I woke up and got thru another day of work. This thinking would always keep me up until 5am trying to extend time I can relax (but was never really relaxed) 

After thinking about how so many aspects of my life have been wasted up until now, I wonder what its like to live a normal life. My wife is amazed at how I feel and my thougjt process for doing anything even just simple task.

Anyways, id really like to try a stimulant some point soon. Im sensitive to caffeine and coffee is not an option for me",1,1735733747.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

Seeing the photos here reminded me of it. I was stood near this building taking a photo of my coffee for Instagram, when this crow walked across the road, hopped up onto the pillar, and started posing for the camera. So of course I had to oblige and take a photo.

My crow murder is probably the main thing I miss about Southampton. There was a big murder in the park that I used to feed regularly. They'd come see me when I sat down on one of the benches and we'd play a game of outwit the seagulls so the seagulls wouldn't steal all their food. Those crows suckered me out of many a Lidl apple turnover. Cheeky brats üòÇ

There was also a small parliament of rooks that lived in the town centre, which surprised me because I was under the impression that they were shyer and stayed away from heavy urban environments where possible. Sometimes they'd hang around in the trees at the edge of the park, but they would also sit around on tall buildings, lamposts, etc. around the high street. I rarely saw them come down from their perches, which is why I've included the latter two photos (apologies for potato phone photo quality üòÖ). ",3,1735733373.0,crowbro,0,1.0,False

1hr1q86,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1hr1q86/budgetfriendly_home_decor_ideas_that_look/,Budget-Friendly Home Decor Ideas That Look Luxurious,"Creating a luxurious home doesn‚Äôt have to come with a hefty price tag. With thoughtful planning and the right [decoration items](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/), you can achieve a high-end look without overspending. From strategic furniture choices to small accents like a [white ceramic vase](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/white-ceramic-vase), here are some budget-friendly home decor ideas that exude sophistication.

# 1. Focus on a Neutral Palette

One of the easiest ways to achieve a luxe look is by sticking to a neutral color palette. Shades of white, beige, and soft gray create a clean and elegant backdrop. Accentuate the space with metallic accents, plush textiles, and statement pieces.

**Pro Tip:** Add a **white ceramic vase** to a side table or shelf. Its minimalist elegance enhances any space, whether filled with fresh flowers or displayed on its own.

# 2. Layer Textures

Layering different textures instantly elevates a room. Combine soft fabrics like velvet or faux fur with natural materials like wood or rattan. This interplay of textures creates a rich and inviting ambiance.

**Budget Tip:** Visit local [home decor stores](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) for affordable throws, cushions, and rugs. These smaller items can make a big impact on the overall vibe of your space.

# 3. Add Statement Vases

Vases are timeless **decoration items** that can transform any corner of your home. Choose versatile options like a [ceramic vase small](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration/vases) enough to fit on a nightstand or coffee table but with enough character to stand out.

**Styling Idea:** Pair a **white ceramic vase** with tall pampas grass for a chic, modern look. Or, group multiple **ceramic vases** of varying heights for an effortlessly curated centerpiece.

# 4. Incorporate Mirrors

Mirrors are a go-to solution for creating the illusion of space and light. A large mirror with a sleek frame can make a small room feel expansive and sophisticated.

**Budget-Friendly Tip:** Check out **home decor stores** for affordable mirrors with stylish designs. Look for options with metallic or geometric frames to add a touch of glamour.

# 5. Mix High and Low Elements

A great way to achieve a luxurious look on a budget is to mix high-end items with affordable finds. Invest in one statement piece, like a bold piece of wall art or a designer light fixture, and complement it with cost-effective decor.

**Affordable Upgrade:** Add a **ceramic vase small** to your bookshelf or console table. Its subtle charm will blend seamlessly with more elaborate pieces.

# 6. Embrace Minimalism

When it comes to luxury, less is often more. Avoid clutter and focus on showcasing a few quality **decoration items**. This approach not only feels sophisticated but also makes your space easier to maintain.

**Styling Tip:** Use a single **white ceramic vase** on a dining table or mantle for an understated yet elegant focal point.

# 7. Use Lighting to Your Advantage

Lighting can make or break a room. Replace harsh overhead lights with softer, layered lighting. Floor lamps, table lamps, and string lights create a warm and inviting atmosphere.

**Budget Solution:** Look for affordable lighting options at **home decor stores**. Pair them with vintage-style bulbs for a designer feel.

# 8. Elevate with Art

Art can instantly make your home look polished. While original art can be expensive, you can find budget-friendly prints or even create your own.

**Display Tip:** Frame your artwork and pair it with other **decoration items** like a **ceramic vase small** to create a cohesive vignette on a console table or shelf.

# Where to Find Budget-Friendly Decor

Finding affordable yet stylish **decoration items** is easier than you think. Many **home decor stores** offer a range of products that look high-end but won‚Äôt break the bank. Look for items like vases, throws, and candles that can effortlessly enhance your space.

# Final Thoughts

Luxury is in the details, and even small changes can make a significant difference in how your home feels. By focusing on key elements like textures, lighting, and thoughtfully chosen **decoration items**‚Äîsuch as a **white ceramic vase**‚Äîyou can create a space that‚Äôs both stylish and budget-friendly.

The key lies in choosing versatile furniture pieces that save space without compromising on aesthetics. Whether you‚Äôre shopping for [armchairs online](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/armchairs) or looking for a [rattan round coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/ava-rattan-coffee-table), here‚Äôs a guide to help you furnish your cozy haven.

# 1. Compact Armchairs: Comfort Meets Functionality

In small apartments, every piece of furniture needs to earn its place, and armchairs are no exception. A cozy armchair can serve multiple purposes, from a reading nook to extra seating for guests. Look for compact designs with slim arms and legs to save space.

**Where to Buy:** Explore a wide range of **armchairs online** to find styles that fit your space, such as mid-century modern pieces or armchairs with hidden storage.

# 2. Multifunctional Sofas

A multifunctional sofa is a must-have for small apartments. Consider a sofa bed or a sectional with storage to maximize utility. Opt for neutral tones to make your space feel larger and add colorful throws or cushions for a pop of personality.

**Pro Tip:** Pair your sofa with a **rattan round coffee table** to introduce texture and warmth to your living room.

# 3. Foldable Dining Sets

Space-saving dining sets are a game changer for small apartments. Foldable or extendable tables allow you to adjust the size based on your needs. Pair these with stackable chairs for a stylish and functional dining area.

**Design Idea:** For a touch of outdoor charm, consider [outdoor garden furniture](https://beta.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor) like lightweight metal or wooden chairs. They‚Äôre easy to move and can double as balcony seating when needed.

# 4. Rattan Round Coffee Tables

A **rattan round coffee table** is perfect for small apartments. Its circular shape eliminates sharp corners, making it ideal for tight spaces, while the rattan texture adds a natural, bohemian vibe. Choose one with a lower shelf for additional storage.

**Styling Tip:** Complement your coffee table with a soft rug and decorative trays to keep it clutter-free and visually appealing.

# 5. Wall-Mounted Shelving

Small apartments often lack storage, and wall-mounted shelves can help solve this problem. Use them to display books, plants, or decorative items without taking up precious floor space. You can even create a floating desk by adding a sturdy shelf at desk height.

**Shopping Tip:** Check out [home interior stores](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) for customizable shelving options that match your apartment's aesthetic.

# 6. Outdoor Garden Furniture for Balconies

If your apartment includes a balcony, transform it into an extension of your living space with **outdoor garden furniture**. Compact bistro sets, foldable chairs, or a small bench with storage can make even the tiniest balcony functional and inviting.

**Design Idea:** Add cushions and throws to create a cozy outdoor retreat for morning coffee or evening relaxation.

# 7. Storage Beds

A storage bed is a lifesaver for small bedrooms. Look for beds with built-in drawers or lift-up platforms to store seasonal clothing, bedding, or other essentials. Pair it with a minimalist headboard to avoid overwhelming the space.

**Pro Tip:** Opt for lighter-colored bed frames to keep your bedroom feeling airy and spacious.

# 8. Nesting Tables

Nesting tables are versatile pieces that can be tucked away when not in use. They‚Äôre perfect for small living rooms as they can double as side tables, extra seating, or even laptop stands.

**Style Suggestion:** Choose nesting tables with natural wood or glass tops to blend seamlessly with your decor.

# Why Shop at Home Interior Stores?

When furnishing a small apartment, **home interior stores** are a treasure trove of smart solutions. These stores offer a curated selection of furniture that caters to both style and practicality, from **armchairs online** to multipurpose tables. Plus, shopping locally or online ensures you‚Äôll find pieces tailored to your specific needs.

# Final Thoughts

Furnishing a small apartment requires thoughtful planning, but the right pieces can transform your space into a functional and stylish retreat. From compact **armchairs online** to the versatility of **outdoor garden furniture**, each choice plays a part in maximizing your apartment‚Äôs potential. Don't forget to incorporate timeless staples like a **rattan round coffee table** to add charm and character to your home.

Whether you‚Äôre looking for a functional lighting solution or a statement piece, the right pendant light can make all the difference. In this guide, we‚Äôll help you choose the perfect pendant lights for every room while exploring trends like **rattan pendant lights** and where to find the best [pendant lights in Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights).

# 1. Living Room: Layered Elegance

The living room is often a gathering space, so lighting should be both functional and stylish. A cluster of [hanging lights](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights) over a coffee table or in a corner can create a focal point and set the tone for the room. For a relaxed, boho-chic vibe, a [rattan pendant light](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/lia-rattan-pendant-light-18749) adds texture and warmth, perfectly complementing natural or neutral decor.

**Pro Tip:** Pair your pendant lights with [floor lamps in Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/milia-floor-lamp-black) to create layered lighting that adjusts to different moods and occasions.

# 2. Dining Room: Centerpiece Illumination

In the dining room, pendant lights often serve as the centerpiece. A single, dramatic fixture or a row of **hanging lights** over the dining table ensures even illumination and enhances the room's aesthetics. Choose a pendant light that complements the size and shape of your table. For round dining tables, consider a circular or **rattan pendant light** to create balance and cohesion.

**Style Tip:** Metallic or glass pendant lights add a modern touch, while natural materials like rattan bring warmth and charm.

# 3. Kitchen: Functional and Stylish

Pendant lights are a popular choice for kitchens, especially when installed above an island or counter. Not only do they provide task lighting, but they also add a touch of personality to the space. Look for adjustable **hanging lights** that can direct light where it‚Äôs needed most.

**Design Inspiration:** A trio of **pendant lights in Dubai** with sleek finishes like matte black or brushed gold creates a modern yet functional vibe. Alternatively, mix materials by incorporating **rattan pendant lights** for an eclectic, cozy feel.

# 4. Bedroom: Ambient Relaxation

In the bedroom, pendant lights are a stylish alternative to traditional bedside lamps. Hang them on either side of the bed for a modern, clutter-free look. Opt for fixtures with dimmable features to control the light intensity for reading or winding down.

**Styling Idea:** Choose soft-toned **hanging lights** or designs with fabric or rattan shades to create a calming, inviting atmosphere.

# 5. Bathroom: Spa-Like Sophistication

Bathrooms often require layered lighting for both functionality and ambiance. Mini **hanging lights** or pendants placed over the vanity mirror add elegance and provide focused light for grooming tasks.

**Expert Tip:** When choosing **pendant lights in Dubai** for bathrooms, look for moisture-resistant options to ensure durability in humid conditions.

# 6. Entryway: A Grand Welcome

Make a statement in your entryway with a bold pendant light. Whether you choose a single oversized piece or a cluster of **hanging lights**, the right lighting fixture can leave a lasting first impression. A **rattan pendant light** works beautifully in entryways with bohemian or tropical decor themes.

**Pro Tip:** Ensure the pendant light is hung at the appropriate height to avoid obstructing views while still catching the eye.

# 7. Outdoor Areas: Cozy Alfresco Lighting

Extend the charm of pendant lights to your outdoor spaces. Weather-resistant **hanging lights** can elevate patios, balconies, or gazebos. A **rattan pendant light** designed for outdoor use brings an organic touch to your alfresco setup, blending seamlessly with natural surroundings.

**Bonus Tip:** Pair pendant lights with complementary **floor lamps in Dubai** for a cohesive lighting scheme indoors and out.

# Why Choose Pendant Lights in Dubai?

1hr1pbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hr1pbu/i_think_my_bf_27m_fancies_his_mates_gf_25f_and_i/,I think my bf 27M fancies his mates gf 25F and i 26F don't know if I'm just being deluded/over jealous,"TW: abortion/baby loss/CPTSD/abuse briefly mentioned for context .

I have been with my bf for 1 year and 10 months. The mates gf 25F has been with his mate for over 7 years.

Here's what I know (to be followed by what I dont know but I believe):

- He went on a guys trip to Le Mans last year. One of the guys took his gf along. I wasn't chuffed when I found out because I wasn't originally invited. He said he didn't think I'd like the camping and I genuinely thought it would just be dudes.

- I went a bit moody while he was away but was generally OK.

- He came back and he said he spent time alone with his mates gf, they went for walks away from the group and talked about her relationship being bad. He insists she never said anything red flag worthy bad about him and she was trying hard not to. He also insisted he was giving her advice and told her about how us as a couple deal with things well. He said we go to couples therapy..
 we don't. We did one session which felt bias and he got a lot of praise and I was told I need to go do individual work due to some CPTSD issues. (my ex was a serial cheater, forced the ending of an early pregnancy and was violent). I have done work for a solid few months but I had to stop because I can't afford it. I'm aware I still have work to do however I am proud of my improvements so far that even he has noticed.
He despite me asking multiple times has refused therapy for himself- even as a preventive measure.

-He also said they sat together in the car journey back. She lost her phone, he rang it and that's why they have eachothers numbers. Apparently when that happened he said she can talk to her if she wants outside of this trip but he understands if she wants to respect her relationship and not.

-He had a ticket of hers in his pocket when he got back. He keeps things like that a lot for memories but why specifically hers? I binned it and he wasn't happy.

-She also fell asleep on his hand and shoulder during the drive and he apparently nudged her and asked her what that would look like to other people.
Thing is.. her bf was in the front passenger seat so how did he not hear this? I asked to see the messages and he claimed there is none.
(When I eventually spoke to her she said that she said the part about not talking and respecting relationships, not him).

-All of this really hit a nerve because it felt so gross and insincere so I kicked off. I was mean about her and refused to meet her, I asked him not to message her and explained I can't know how ' respectful' they really were because i wasn't there and what I'm being told isn't filling me with confidence.

-Later, after a lot of discussion and deliberation and being in a room with her, my bf and her bf and another party - I decided that I am not comfortable with him going again if she is going to be there too.

-The group shared a huge tent with individual rooms and they discussed kicking eachother and snoring etc though the tent wall.

-He was very unhappy about this so I said it might be OK for me if I went too. He insisted I can't go because I won't like it, just like last time.
(He has gone on multiple trips without me abroad and I have never said no and that I'm not comfortable with it before). 

So i told him no, neither of us are going then. If you want to be in a relationship with me- that is my boundary.

He was livid about this and refused to tell his mates he's not going. In fact I don't think he ever did he just delayed buying the tickets.

-Few months down the line now and he found out that she broke up with his mate. Next day hes asking about taking her ticket and going this year. I said okay fine but be certain she's not going and he said even if she does show up, he'll come straight home. (I don't believe that).

-Few days later we have an argument about something entirely different, and he leaves the house (he's never done this before). He showered, got in gym/relax stuff and left. He said 'its a long story' when I asked where he went. He was gone for hours so I got deeply insecure and asked his mates gf if she was with him. She said no and offered to get a coffee and go for a drive (this was the first time I'd ever really spoke to her) .

I accepted and we went and chatted. She seemed sincere but idk if that's my bias to trust women. She said it doesn't seems like my bf to be like this and she doesn't know where he went. She said nothing happened in le mans they just chatted about stuff and she told me about losing her phone and getting his humber because he called it. She told me about how they agreed they don't have to speak to respect relationships but she said she was the one that said that.
While I was with her my bf found out where I was and said he can't believe what I'm doing. He went off on me about seeking solace in someone I spoke badly about. 

-I am now confused because to go to le mans with her, he was pushing me to meet her and to go on double dates etc which I turned down after initially meeting her in a group environment. This was because I didn't feel like she liked me. 

Surely me getting along with her was what he wanted? It just took me ages to get there.

- I agreed with the gf that if we were forced to be mates it probably wouldn't have worked and this way was a little better in a way.

- Yes she didn't deserve to be spoken badly about. I was scared and unsure and insecure. None of this was ever said to her or someone who would get it to her other than my bf. 

I told her about this and apologised and she said she's gets it and probably would've been the same.
She even said that she promises if I breakup with my bf right now she won't go there.

He still insists I've done something wrong and overstepped by talking to her.


Things I don't know but I'm starting to believe:

- He fancies her.  By telling her he left and idk where he is he now- he was made to look bad infront of her and he's mad

- he doesn't actually want me to be mates with her in a way that doesn't benefit him because he might not have a chance anymore 

-he seems to think that because he couldn't talk to her that I can't 

TLDR: They met on a trip without me and spent time alone, both their stories match up but his behaviour doesn't. He's pissed I met up with her.",1,1735733117.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

It‚Äôs been weeks. Or maybe just days. I‚Äôve lost the ability to tell. I‚Äôve been trapped in my house, unable to leave. Every window is covered, every reflective surface shattered. The man, the one who looks like my wife, who looks like me, haunts me even now. I can‚Äôt see his face without feeling my chest tighten, my breath catch, my entire body seize in panic.

He‚Äôs gone, but he‚Äôs everywhere. I told him to leave, to go far, far away, but the weight of him remains. I smashed the mirrors to escape that cursed reflection, but I still feel it, the wrongness in my face. My hands tremble as they touch the angles of my cheeks, the shape of my jaw, all unfamiliar now. Every brush of my fingers sends a jolt of nausea through me.

Today, I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore.

I stepped outside for the first time since it happened. The sunlight hit me like a physical force, blinding and harsh. My legs wobbled beneath me, but I kept moving, squinting as the light burned into my vision. A breeze swept past, cool and indifferent. I barely felt it.

I reached my car, each step a monumental effort. My hands fumbled with the keys as though they belonged to someone else. When the engine roared to life, it was the first sound that didn‚Äôt terrify me in days. I gripped the wheel, took a deep breath, and pulled out of the driveway.

Anywhere but here.

I didn‚Äôt care where I ended up, as long as it wasn‚Äôt this cursed place. The road stretched ahead, empty and endless, and I drove like my life depended on it. I didn‚Äôt dare look at the other drivers, afraid of what I might see. What if they all had his face? What if they all had mine?

The highway felt like salvation. Each mile that passed should have been a step closer to freedom, but the knot in my chest didn‚Äôt loosen. I felt like ripping my face off, right then and there. My hands shook on the wheel, and my breath came in shallow, uneven gasps. The gas light finally blinked on, snapping me back to reality.

I took the next exit, hoping for a new town, a new beginning. My heart sank as I saw the sign.

It was my hometown.

No.

This couldn‚Äôt be. I had driven for hours, taken every turn I could to escape, but here it was. The caf√© came into view, and my stomach churned violently. No matter how I turned, how I tried to reroute, the caf√© was always there, waiting.

I had no choice.

My legs felt like they weighed a thousand pounds as I climbed out of the car. My body trembled with every step toward the door. The closer I got, the more suffocating the air became. My vision blurred, and my ears rang. My hand reached for the handle, and I almost pulled away, but something inside me pushed forward.

The bell above the door chimed as I stepped inside.

He was there. The waiter. Myself. Everyone else.

‚ÄúGood morning, Mr. Mill. The usual?‚Äù he asked, his voice unnervingly cheerful.

I froze, my mind blank. My heart pounded in my chest, each beat a hammer against my ribs. The waiter disappeared for a moment and returned with a coffee cup. I couldn‚Äôt look away from it.

Inside the cup was a heart.

‚ÄúYour favorite,‚Äù he said, smiling that too-familiar smile. ‚ÄúI put extra effort into this one.‚Äù

I felt my knees buckle as the room spun around me. My breath caught in my throat, and I gripped the nearest table to steady myself. ‚ÄúWHY? WHY IS THIS HAPPENING? AM I DREAMING?‚Äù I screamed, my voice cracking with desperation.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you remember?‚Äù the waiter said, his tone almost pitying. ‚ÄúYou prayed to me that lonely day in the hospital. On your wife‚Äôs deathbed.‚Äù

His words hit me like a physical blow. My mind raced, fragments of memory clawing their way to the surface.

‚ÄúI remember,‚Äù I whispered, my voice trembling. ‚ÄúI remember everything.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my heart, Mr. Mill,‚Äù he said, his smile widening. ‚ÄúYou prayed, and I answered. You said you loved her so much that her heart belonged to you. So now, here I am. I belong to you, don‚Äôt I?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I choked out, tears streaming down my face.

‚ÄúOh well,‚Äù he said with a shrug, picking up the cup. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt want it, I can take it back. But remember, no refunds.‚Äù

‚ÄúNO! PLEASE DON‚ÄôT!‚Äù I screamed, lunging toward him. ‚ÄúSHE‚ÄôLL DIE!‚Äù

His grin twisted into something darker, something hungry. ‚ÄúI can however, swap your order for something of the same cost. I heard you wanted to try ripping your face off. Let‚Äôs see how that feels.‚Äù

Before I could react, his hand shot out, cold and unyielding. His fingers sank into my skin, tearing through flesh like paper. I felt the ripping, the burning agony as he started at my ear and dragged toward the center of my face.

I screamed.

I begged.

I pleaded....

I entered the building, took the elevator and landed on the second floor.

The hum of the office surrounded me, the sounds of keyboards and quiet chatter filling the air. Tim or whatever used to be Tim was talking nearby, his voice as grating as ever. I didn‚Äôt look at him. I didn‚Äôt look at anyone.

My hands reached for the photo of my wife on my desk. She was smiling, her hair catching the sunlight just right, the way it always did.

But in the reflection of the frame, I saw it.

My face...

From a short break in Bangkok (who could forget all the pool photos of Dino...), to numerous mentions of sebongs‚Äô individual memories in places like Bulacan and Jakarta, I personally thought SVT has had some stand-out (and very positive and memorable) moments in the region.

So today, as we begin a **17**\-day countdown to the 17RH Asia tour's first stop in the Philippines, I wanted to start a thread of our favourite moments with sebongs in Southeast Asia! ü©∑ü©µ And may the tour (and 2025 on the whole) bring many more unforgettable moments with SVT!

My own favourite SVT-in-SEA moment has to be S.Coups, Jeonghan, and Wonwoo having the most awesome and picture-perfect [adventure in Yogyakarta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWsozueNVmw), Indonesia during Battle Trip. It amazed me that they really immersed themselves in local food and delicacies (like the streetside charcoal coffee) and gamely bargained with market vendors. I also loved that they sported beautiful Javanese batik (wax-dye) attire.

Of course, this was also the moment that created Jeonghan's iconic ""Mahal!"" line. The word means 'expensive' in the Indonesian language, and our clever angel kept saying it adorably to get better deals... which of course he managed successfully!!

1hr1jd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DragonLifestory/comments/1hr1jd7/chapter_11_part_02/,Chapter 11 Part 02,"Meanwhile in Gothenburg city, Hasse goes into Liseberg. He has planned to see the Bratzkidz concert, but first he wants to walk around the park and just cuddle. Hasse sees the Ferris wheel and wants to ride it. He doesn't usually ride any attractions, but today he makes an exception.

There is no queue at the checkout at the Ferris wheel. Hasse pays at the till and goes towards the Ferris wheel. There is a gondola available immediately and Hasse gets into it when the person in charge of attractions opens the door to it. Soon the gondola goes further and further up and Hasse enjoys the view. It is a very sunny day and there are hardly any clouds in the sky.

In the end, the gondola is at the very top and Hasse can see his apartment building where he lives but also Ullevi and several other famous places in Gothenburg city. Hasse enjoys life. When the gondola comes down, Hasse gets out of it and continues walking in the park at Liseberg.

Meanwhile in √Öby, the bright yellow dragon is heading towards the villa where a human threw a frying pan at him. The dragon is still mad at the father who threw a frying pan at it. The dragon is at the light blue villa and it looks down on the villa and the large balcony where the people were sitting.

The light yellow dragon flies low over the light blue villa. The dragon looks down at the balcony where the owner of the villa threw a heavy frying pan on it an hour ago. The dragon intends to take revenge on the owner who threw the frying pan. The dragon now knows exactly how to best take revenge. The dragon presses against the organ in the lower abdomen that has all the gas for the fire spewing and it opens its jaw so it's wide open. The dragon makes a quick movement at the throat. The movement releases the gas at the same time as it is ignited.

The dragon spews a metre-long flame against the wooden roof of the light blue villa. This dragon can also spew liquid fire but it chooses to spew regular hot fire. The fire that shoots out of the dragon's wide open jaw is 700 degrees hot. It's hot enough to set fire to all the wood on the roof. The entire wooden roof almost immediately begins to burn with high flames. It crackles from the fire on the roof. So far, no one in the villa has noticed what has happened.

The bright yellow dragon flies further down and it can see the people sitting on a red sofa in their living room. They are sitting and watching some entertainment program on their TV. Some of the people laugh at something they hear or see on their TV. The dragon presses against the organ with the gas and makes the rapid movement in the throat again.

The dragon again spews a meter-long flame from its wide-open jaw, and the house wall and balcony are ignited directly by the dragon's fire. The house wall and balcony begin to burn with large flames. The fire crackles loudly as it burns up the wood on both the house wall and the balcony. The high flames soon reach almost up to the already burning roof.

The people panic. The dragon can see how the panicked people run around inside the villa and try to get the door to the balcony open. Someone in the family gets a fire extinguisher. A loud bang is heard from inside the villa. The burning roof has collapsed over the attic and soon the attic of the villa is also on fire. The flames are soon high from both the attic and the roof.

The dragon again spews hot fire from its wide open jaw and the glass in the patio door shatters from the high heat from the dragon's fire. A fire starts in the family's living room and the whole family rushes out onto the balcony. They have two fire extinguishers with them and manage to put out the fire on the balcony.

The dragon spews more fire. This time the dragon's fire spews into the living room through the broken patio door. The sofa that the family was sitting on and all the furnishings start to burn heavily. When the synthetic curtains that hang further in by the side windows catch fire, it happens quickly. The whole living room becomes a burning inferno. No one can go in there and survive. The flames shoot far out from the broken patio door and up over the house wall. The two flames soon meet and almost form a vortex of fire.

The dragon flies even further down and finally lands on the large lawn in the garden. The dragon stares into the eyes of the man who threw the frying pan. The pale yellow dragon growls at the man. The dragon presses against the organ with the gas and again makes the rapid movement in the throat again.

The dragon spews a meter long flame at the man and he starts burning immediately. The dragon's jaw is wide open as it spews out the hot fire. The dragon holds on for a long time and spews its fire. It moves its large head as it continues to spew fire. The fire once again hits the now fully burning living room but also the house wall and the balcony. The flames that lick the house wall grow even higher. All the people on the terrace burn up in an instant.

When the dragon finally stops spewing fire, the villa burns heavily. It is burning violently with meter-high flames both inside and outside the villa. The flames crackle loudly as they burn everything from the inside out. The dragon stands for a moment, watching the high flames burning down the villa. Finally the dragon flies away. It has had its revenge.

Meanwhile in M√∂lndal, the dark red dragon has finally found food. There is a couple walking in the forest and the dragon lands directly in front of the couple. The couple are so surprised when a giant dragon suddenly stands in front of them that they don't even try to escape.

The dragon grabs the man first. By pure instinct, the dragon knows that men have an easier time fighting back than women. The man tries to fight back as he is in the dragon's large jaws but the dragon effectively crushes the man's spine with its powerful teeth and a loud cracking sound is heard. The man can no longer resist and the dragon can easily swallow the man whole without any problems. The man flows down the dragon's throat and ends up in the first belly. He starts to hit the walls of the stomach but it doesn't help him.

The woman is the easiest to swallow for the dragon. She doesn't even resist and just stands there crying as the dragon picks her up with its jaw. She loses her shoes just before she goes down the dragon's long throat and she and them ends up in its first belly. When the two people have ended up in the big belly of the dark red dragon, it flies on.

Meanwhile in Gothenburg city, Hasse and several hundred others stand in front of the big stage at Liseberg. They are waiting for the Bratzkidz to start playing. All instruments are present on the big stage. Now all that is needed is the group itself.

Some of the players run onto the stage and stand by their instruments. The audience starts clapping to the beat and shouting. Those standing at the instruments look happily at all the people.

After a short while, the Bratzkidz finally come on stage. The singer Bodil is wearing sun yellow clothes and he smiles happily at the audience and grabs the microphone.

\- How are you, Gothenburg?

\- Yeah!

\- Sorry, I didn't really hear. How are you, Gothenburg?

\- YEAH!

\- That was better. Then we start with the first song. You know. It's summer and then a little reggae goes well. That's why we now play ""Summer reggae""

The crowd cheers and the song begins. Everyone claps along and sings along loudly. Hasse also sings along in the song.

Applause roars when the song is over. Bodil presents the next song.

\- Can you gyus party properly? I want to see everyone in the audience jump when we play the song ""Bop time"". This also applies to those of you who stand in front of the stage and film. Put down your cameras and party away.

Everyone starts jumping when the song starts and everyone sings along to the song.

When the song is over, Bodil takes out old military clothes.

\- As you may know, I've made a mess while in the army and it was awful. So here's a song about it and it's called ""Sorry Sir Corporal but I want to go home""

Meanwhile in M√∂lndal, the dark red dragon has arrived at a large dark yellow villa. The color is intense and stands out in the dragon's eyes. The villa smells strongly of paint and the dragon does not like the pungent smell. The villa has been repainted during the day and the paint is still wet. Those who have painted have used linseed oil paint. The dragon decides to spew fire on the villa. The dragon presses against the organ with the gas in its stomach and makes the movement in the throat while keeping its jaw wide open.

Liquid hot fire shoots out of the dragon's wide open jaw and ignites the freshly painted house wall. The fire becomes very strong because the fire spreads all over the wall, but also because those who painted the house wall have used linseed oil. Soon the flames are high above the roof of the villa. The dragon flies lower so it can see through the windows. It cannot see any person in there.

The dragon spews liquid fire at two windows and they shatter from the high heat. The dragon spews its liquid fire through the broken window and the fire floats around the kitchen, igniting everything. The liquid fire ignites the wooden floor and the two kitchen curtains and the kitchen table and all the chairs. The fire continues and ignites all the kitchen cabinets and the fire rushes up to the ceiling. Soon it's like a burning inferno in the kitchen. The dragon flies around the villa and comes to its back.

The dragon spews its liquid fire onto a wooden balcony and a glass door leading to a large living room. The glass is shattered by the dragon's hot flames. The dragon lands on the burning balcony and enters the villa. The dragon has a little trouble getting inside the villa because it is so big and its wings stick out to the sides but after folding its wings it manages to get in even though it hits its head in the doorway.

The reason the dragon goes in is because it wants to see if there is any human prey hiding. If there is someone hiding, the dragon will eat them. The dragon soon comes to a large bedroom. It smells the people who live here but there is no one in the bedroom and the dragon gets frustrated and growls loudly.

The dragon spews its liquid fire into the bedroom. The liquid fire flows under the two beds and the fire is hot enough to ignite the underside of the beds as well as the wooden floor. The fire almost explodes from the two beds because the cotton in the beds burns so strongly. The fire continues and ignites a rag rug and the fire quickly spreads to three well-stocked wardrobes. There is a big explosion of fire when the clothes in the wardrobes start to burn. The roof catches fire and begins to collapse. The dragon watches as the entire bedroom turns into a huge fire inferno and the dragon feels very satisfied and it moves on to the living room

The dragon stands in the living room and spews his liquid fire and the fire splashes against the wooden walls and ignites them in seconds while the liquid fire that is on the floor flows around like hot lava, igniting the floor itself but also the bookshelves and the sofa and the coffee table. There is a thick and full carpet under the sofa and when it is ignited, the sofa is almost lifted by the enormous force of the fire. When the whole living room is an inferno of fire, the dragon leaves the villa.

The villa is engulfed by the dragon's hot fire and the flames are reflected in the dragon's yellow eyes. The dragon likes what it sees and stands for a long time looking at the fully burning villa before flying away.

The bright yellow dragon in √Öby has arrived at a farm where there actually seems to be food. The farmer has pigs in a large outhouse and the dragon lands in front of the outhouse. It can hear the pigs in there. The outhouse has a large gate that is closed and the dragon pushes against the gate to open it. But the gate is locked and won't open. The dragon pushes harder against the gate and finally the gate opens with a bang and the dragon can enter.

The dragon enters the outhouse and directly attacks the biggest pig it sees. The dragon begins to eat the pig while it is still alive. The blood spurts from the pig's belly, staining the dragon's face blood red. The dragon feasts on the pig's flesh while the pig's squeals die down to finally become completely silent. A large pool of blood begins to form on the ground from the pig's blood.

When the first pig is eaten, the dragon goes straight to the next pig and the dragon begins to feast on the pig's flesh. Soon the entire pig is eaten and the pool of blood on the ground has grown larger.

The dragon is about to take a third pig when a man suddenly runs into the outhouse with a large rifle.

\- You don't touch my pigs, you beast.

The man shoots at the dragon. It doesn't really hurt as the shots only hit the dragon's protective scales but the dragon gets angry that the man is shooting him. The man fires at the dragon again. The dragon advances towards the man and growls softly. The man exits the outhouse backwards and the dragon keeps advancing towards him.

In the end, both the dragon and the man are out of the outhouse. Another man comes running from a grey-brown residence on the farm. He also holds a large rifle. Both men fire at the dragon and it roars loudly at them but they don't seem to be spooked. The two men shoot at the dragon again and now the dragon gets furious.

The dragon flies into the air. The two men fire again. Once up in the air, the dragon presses very hard against the organ with the gas at the same time as it makes the rapid movement in the throat. It has its jaw wide open.

The dragon spits fire at the two farmers but this time the fire is almost 1000 degrees hot. It is not red but light blue. The two peasants burn up immediately. The dragon can hear people from inside the grey-brown house and it spits fire at it. The house immediately begins to burn heavily. No one from the house manages to get out before it is over-lit. The dragon watches as the house burns down.

The dragon lands and re-enters the outhouse and continues to feast on the flesh of the pigs. The squeals of the pigs can be heard a good distance from the outhouse. When the dragon is completely stuffed, it flies away. He intends to tell the other dragons about the outhouse. They probably also want to eat their fill of the pigs.

The red dragon in √Öby flies around and is very restless. He doesn't really know what to do. He is not hungry because he has eaten three people.

The red dragon flies over the villa that the bright yellow dragon set on fire. The red dragon is immediately inspired and decides that he will also set the villas on fire. He also knows very well that man is afraid of fire.

The dragon flies above the villas and thinks about which villa to spray its fire on. In the end, the dragon finds a dark green villa that it wants to spray its fire on. The dragon dives down towards the villa and it looks in through several windows. There are people in the villa and they seem to be having a good time. But not for much longer.

The dragon presses against the organ with the gas in its stomach and makes the movement in the throat while keeping its jaw wide open.

The dragon's hot fire spews through a wide open door from a large balcony. The wide open door leads into a large living room. That's where the people are. The dragon moves its head constantly as it spews its fire continuously. The dragon's hot fire ignites the people, the sofa, the large coffee table, the luxurious thick carpets, the thick plastic curtains and a wide wall. The whole living room starts to burn heavily and the high flames burst through the open door and soon ignite the house wall. All the people are burned alive by the dragon's hot fire and the fully burnt living room. They have no chance of survival. Soon the red dragon can smell burnt human flesh.

The dragon spews its hot fire on the outer wall of the house where it is already burning. The flames soon rise all the way to the roof of the villa because the dragon's fire is so hot. Soon the entire west side of the villa is burning very heavily. When the thick carpets in the living room catch fire, jet black smoke billows out along with meter-high flames from the open living room door. The meter-long flames ignite the large wooden balcony. Soon the whole balcony is on fire. The dragon flies around to the south side of the villa.

The dragon spews its red-hot fire through an open bedroom window. The fire that shoots out of the dragon's jaws causes the bed, two closets full of clothes and the rugs on the floor to burn. The doors to the three wardrobes are massive and they haven't started to burn yet but a long and wide rug that is right next to all three wardrobes is starting to burn and the fire is finding its way through the bottom cracks of the wardrobe doors and igniting the clothes.

There is mostly only cotton and similar clothes in all the wardrobes, which causes the flames to rise very quickly as garment after garment catches fire. Soon the bottom three floors of the closets are fully ablaze but in seconds the flames reach up to the next floor and the next and the next. The doors of all three wardrobes are blown open by the heavy flames. The flames reach up to the ceiling in just a few seconds. Thick black smoke billows from all three wardrobes and from the plaster ceiling. After a few seconds, it's like a big firestorm in the bedroom

Meanwhile, the dragon has moved to another window. Inside there is a nice and modern kitchen. The dragon spews its red-hot fire at the closed kitchen window. It shatters from the intense heat and the dragon's fire enters the kitchen. The new tables and chairs are relatively fireproof but the dragon is stubborn and eventually the furniture catches fire. They do not burn as strongly as the curtains in the kitchen window, but it will still be a fairly strong fire. The kitchen is the room that burns the least. The dragon flies higher over the villa.

The dragon spews its red-hot fire on the roof and attic of the villa. The attic burns the most because there is a lot of flammable material there. After just a few seconds, the flames are several meters from the wind. The high flames make large holes in the roof and set fire to dry branches hanging over the roof. The branches belong to a dead tree that stands next to the villa. The dry branches start to burn explosively and it doesn't take long until the whole tree is in full flames.

The dragon flies around the entire villa while spewing powerful fire non-stop. The entire villa is engulfed by the dragon's fire. After a short while the dragon flies on.

Meanwhile in Gothenburg city, the concert with Bratzkidz is over and Hasse is going home. But he sees the new cafe that has opened almost next to where he lives and he gets curious and goes in. Hasse has thought of cooking but why not buy a bun or something else here first?

There aren't that many people inside the cafe. A female customer comes in and she has a bunch of papers in a big folder. She fumbles with a cell phone and ends up dropping all the papers on the floor.

Hasse goes over to the girl and tries to help her collect all the papers. She smiles happily at him. When they both stand up, they hit each other's foreheads and both Hasse and the girl laugh nervously. Oops.

\- Thank you for helping me collect the papers.

\- Oh. it was so little.

\- Do you live here in town?

\- Sure. Newly moved in. Just a few meters from here.

\- Alone? I mean, do you live alone?

Hasse is embarrassed and his face turns completely red.

\- Yes. Since about five years ago.

\- May I invite you to a coffee?

\- It's not necessary.

\- But if I want to?. My name is Madelene by the way.

\- Okay then. You are welcome to invite me to coffee. My name is Hasse.

Hasse and Madelene look into each other's eyes and something happens. They immediately fall in love with each other. Both look down after a while. Hasse blushes slightly.

\- Well. Hasse. What would you like for coffee?

\- Well, Madeleine. A cinnamon bun and a cup of coffee are always good.

\- So right. I choose that.

Madelene pays for both herself and Hasse. They go in and sit down at an empty table and start eating the cinnamon buns and drinking the good coffee.

The cinnamon buns and coffee run out after 20 minutes, but Hasse and Madelene sit for almost two hours and talk to each other. They talk about what they do and what they have done earlier in their lives. They decide that they will go to Kato's concert tomorrow at Liseberg.

Hasse and Madelene leave the cafe and stand outside in the street and continue talking for a while before going to their apartments. Hasse cooks some food when he comes up to the apartment. He doesn't bother to check the news before going to bed.

On the news, several reporters talk about the fires that have taken place in √Öby and M√∂lndal. But no one knows that it is dragons that have set fire to all the villas.

Meanwhile, in the Cave near √Öby, the dragon queen and the male mate. They have been busy feeding their 79 baby dragons and fetching more food. It is only the male that has collected food, but the food supply is replenished. The male has had to fly further because the other dragon pairs in √Öby and M√∂lndal have cleared all nearby farms for food.",1,1735732417.0,DragonLifestory,0,1.0,False

1hr1ivi,https://www.reddit.com/r/DragonLifestory/comments/1hr1ivi/chapter_11_part_01/,Chapter 11 Part 01,"While all the eggs are being laid, the six homeless dragons wake up. They stretch and soon they are up in the air looking for something to eat. The dragons are getting very hungry. The six dragons beat their powerful wings and they carry them forward. The dragons that are in √Öby are bright blue, red and light yellow, while the ones in M√∂lndal are dark blue, dark red and orange.

The dragons in √Öby do not manage to find any food yet, but the dark blue and the orange dragon that are in M√∂lndal each find a human and a dog. The people are out early and resting their dogs.

The dark blue dragon lands in front of the man resting his dog. It is a tall and handsome man and the dog he is resting is a boxer. The dog is immediately afraid of the dragon and starts barking at it. The dragon swoops down with its great jaws and pulls the human off the ground. He begins to slide into the dragon's large mouth.

The dark blue dragon throws his head back so that the tall man goes down the dragon's large throat. Soon only the man's feet protrude from the dragon's jaws, but they also disappear into the great jaw. On the outside of the dragon's throat, the man appears as a thick lump moving downwards. The dark red dragon flies right above the dark blue dragon as he swallows the human.

When the human is swallowed, the dragon grabs hold of the barking dog and swallows it as well. Soon the man and the dog are in the first belly of the dragon. The dog has become silent because it was suffocated by all the mucus in the throat and in the first stomach. But the man is still alive. He is both sad and frustrated. He is sad that his best dog has now died and he is frustrated to be swallowed by this great beast. After a while, the first stomach is filled with a tough light yellow liquid that numbs the nerves of the tall man. But it does not numb his feelings.

Meanwhile, the orange dragon sees a lonely woman who is out walking her dog. The dragon lands near the woman and she tries to escape but the dragon grabs her with its jaws and bites off her head. The dragon swallows the head right away. The dragon picks up the headless body with its jaws and tilts the head back so the body can drain down the throat. The woman's body is visible as a lump at the throat. The bump moves down until it is no longer visible.

The dog that the woman rested is terrified and growling. The dog is a kind black labrador. The dragon picks up the dog in its jaws and swallows it. The dark red dragon passes the orange dragon as it swallows the dog.

The dark-red dragon is really frustrated. He has seen that both the dark blue dragon and the orange dragon have found something to eat and he is frustrated because he has not found anything edible. He needs to take his anger out on something.

There are many villas below where the dragon flies and he gets annoyed with the people. They both smell and taste good, but they hide in their villas. When the dark red dragon lived in the cave near √Öby, he got to taste human flesh and he thought it was very good. But these people who are in the villas don't seem to be as readily available as the meat in the cave was. Finally he decides what to do to get food. The dragon instinctively knows that people are afraid of fire. He will spew fire on the villas. Then maybe he can catch the people running out of the villas.

The first villa the dragon comes to is colored yellow. The mother usually calls the villa their sun villa because it is yellow like the sun. The family that lives in the villa has just got up and is having breakfast. They have planned an excursion today. The whole family will go to Liseberg and the children will be able to go to as many attractions as they want. They are going to see the Bratzkidz group later in the day.

\- Can someone send the butter, please?

\- Wait. I'm just going to spread some butter on my sandwich.

\- But you've played well with it for a long time.

\- I haven't at all. You are stupid

\- I'm not at all, but you're stupid stupid stupid

\- Dad. He says I'm stupid.

\- Now stop arguing and eat breakfast properly. Stop playing with the butter and give it to your little sister. My God! What good coffee!

\- What is that big shadow above the villa?

\- It's not a shadow... Hmm. That seems a little strange.

\- But what is that?.

\- I wonder that too. It actually looks like a dragon.

\- Dragons don't exist. It's just imagination.

\- Tell that to the dragon flying above the villa right now. Damn how big it is. What massive wings it has. Little sister, you have to see this.

\- I see it. Do not approach the window. The dragon can be dangerous.

The dark red dragon flies over the villa and he begins to push against an organ that sits in the lower part of his stomach. The organ is very large and contains gas that the dragon always has. The gas is flammable, but in order for it to ignite, the dragon must make a special movement in its throat and have its mouth wide open. But the dragon does not make the movement in the throat yet or has its jaw wide open. Instead, it flies further down and soon it can see the family in the kitchen. And everyone in the family can now see the dragon

\- Oh my god that's actually a...

\- Dragon. It has to be.

\- But they don't exist, do they? It must be something else

\- Do you think it can breathe..

The dragon spews liquid fire at the window and the villa wall. The window is made of glass but the wooden paneling around it catches fire. The house wall starts burning immediately as the fire splashes everywhere and ignites all the wood. This fire is almost 900 degrees hot. It hasn't caught fire inside the kitchen yet but the family can already feel the immense heat from the flames which quickly get bigger as the outer wall of the house burns with full flames

\- We have to get out. We have to get out. Fire. Hurry hurry.

\- Is it so well thought out when there is a dragon right outside the house?

\- If we're not going to die in a house fire, it's probably the best idea. Children, run straight to the car and hide there. Here is the key to the car.

The whole family runs out of the villa. The kids have the car keys and run to the car and open the back door and jump in. They close behind them. The father and mother distract the dragon in the meantime. The mother tries to scare the dragon by making herself bigger and roaring at it. The father gets hold of an old iron pipe that has been lying in the garden plot for many years. He swings the pipe at the dragon.

\- Leave! There is nothing here for you. Fly away!

The father manages to hit the dragon with the pipe. The pipe hits one of the dragon's wings. There is a hollow sound and the dragon roars loudly as it hurts its wing. The father quickly jumps away because he realizes that the dragon will spew fire on him. The father starts running towards the car. He doesn't turn around. The mother also starts to run.

The dragon again spews its liquid fire but this time the fire is so hot that it is bluish. The fire spews through the front door of the villa and because it flows so fast and is so hot, it immediately ignites everything that is combustible. The dragon moves its head as it spews its liquid fire. Soon the flames are high above the roof of the villa. The fire crackles and roars loudly as everything in the villa burns up.

The dragon continues to spew fire on the villa and some of the fire splashes on the mother's clothes and they start to burn. The mother throws herself down on the gravel path outside the villa to smother the flames but the heavy fire soon engulfs her entire body and it is clear that she will not survive.

\- No, no. Not mom, not mom.

\- Shhh. We have to be quiet so it doesn't hear us.

\- But drive instead. Mother cannot be saved. The villa cannot be saved now either. It will burn down before the fire department gets here.

The father sees the logic in what the eldest child is saying and starts the car engine. He puts it into reverse and reverses as fast as he can. Then he drives as fast as he can in the small residential community. He checks in the rearview mirror to see if the dragon is following but it has started to eat the mother.

The father sees in the rearview mirror how all their windows in the villa explode in a big explosion of fire. Even though the villa is burning violently, the dragon continues to spray its fire on it. After a while, the dragon flies up into the air again and leaves the burning villa.

The father and the children sit in the car and think about what to do. After a while they decide to drive to Liseberg even though their villa has burned down and the mother is dead. They need some fun now that everything terrible has happened.

The second villa the dragon comes to is light gray. It is a small villa and the elderly couple who live in the villa are still sleeping. The dragon flies low and looks into the windows but sees no one but it smells the people who live there. Have they already managed to hide, the dragon thinks.

The dragon presses against the organ with the gas and makes the movement in the throat at the same time as it has its jaw wide open.

Liquid fire shoots out from the dragon's open jaw and the fire ignites the entire house wall and roof. The flames lick the entire house wall and the roof begins to bend inwards. The fire crackles and roars as the wood burns. The flames from the villa are eerily reflected in the dragon's yellow eyes.

The dragon once again spews its liquid fire at the villa and several windows crack from the high heat of the dragon's hot fire. The elderly in the bedroom sleep so deeply and have such poor hearing that they do not hear when the window in the bedroom breaks. The thick smoke from the burning house wall and roof seeps in through the broken window and down the throats and lungs of the sleepers. They have forgotten to put new batteries in the two fire alarms that are in the villa.

The dragon spews its liquid fire through the broken window and the fire floats around the bedroom, soon igniting several closets. The thin doors catch fire immediately and because the fire is so hot, all the clothes ignite. Many of the clothes that burn are synthetic, which quickly increases the flames even more. Soon all the clothes in the two wardrobes are on fire. Black smoke billows from the burning synthetic clothes in the closets. The ceiling in the room starts to burn due to the high flames from the closets.

Everything in the room starts to burn as the liquid fire ignites the elders' beds and two rag rugs that are near the beds and the two elders wake up to find themselves on fire. They both see and feel the hot fire. They try to get out of their beds but the room is burning so badly that they are unable to get out of their beds. The thick protective plastic against urine leakage that is found in the beds of the elderly melts and soon flows onto the floor. The dragon soon senses the burning smell of human flesh. The liquid fire flows out through the bedroom door and comes out into a hall where there are many outer clothes and the clothes start to burn heavily and black thick smoke billows everywhere.

The dragon spews even more liquid fire through the broken window and the fire flows into the kitchen and living room, igniting every room and soon the villa is on fire. All the windows are blown out by the immense heat from the fire raging in the villa. The dragon's liquid fire is almost 1000 degrees hot. The flames reach several meters above the roof of the villa and it is really close a power line starts to burn, but a light breeze blows the fire in another direction. The fire is now burning so strongly that it almost sounds like it is roaring.

The dragon flies on. The dragon has been filmed by a neighbor and he has filmed when the dragon has spewed its fire on the villa. The neighbor uploads the clip to his Facebook and Youtube accounts. Pretty soon he gets reactions from both Facebook and YouTube. Some of those who see the clip believe that it is fake, while others understand that it is happening for real. Those who understand that it is real are shocked by how the dragon spews its liquid fire at the villa. It almost looks like it's spewing lava.

While the people and the dogs are being devoured by each dragon and the dark red dragon has set fire to two villas in M√∂lndal, Hasse wakes up in his apartment in Gothenburg city. He eats breakfast while watching the morning news. Hasse is going to a concert today. He's going to see the group Bratzkidz. Hasse thinks they play such nice music. But first he has to do the laundry.

Hasse goes down to the laundry room and starts the machines. While he waits for them to finish, he cleans his apartment. When he is done cleaning, he goes downstairs and puts the clothes in the dryer. While the dryers are running, Hasse mops the floor in the apartment and also goes for a short walk and buys some milk in a grocery store. When Hasse comes back, all the clothes are dry and he takes them up to his apartment and puts them in repsective wardrobes.

At the same time as Hasse puts in his clean laundry, the bright yellow dragon flies around √Öby looking for food. So far it hasn't found any food and it's getting really hungry. Suddenly, the dragon sees something that interests it. A family sits outside on their balcony and eats breakfast.

The dragon looks down on the family eating breakfast. So far, no one in the family has noticed the dragon. The bright yellow dragon flies further down and finally lands on the family's lawn. Now the family gets to see it. Some of the family start shouting and banging their cutlery on the plates to scare the dragon away. But it doesn't get scared.

The father of the family stands up violently and quickly enters the villa, and it seems that he is looking for something. The bright yellow dragon hopes it is something edible. After a while the father comes out and he has something with him. The dragon goes up to the balcony and waits impatiently for food. But the father has no food with him but a heavy frying pan.

The bright yellow dragon gets a little upset that the man doesn't bring any food. The father starts swinging the heavy frying pan at the dragon. Mostly to scare, probably. The dragon hisses angrily at the father but he doesn't get scared and continues swinging the frying pan back and forth in a sweeping motion while yelling at the dragon.

\- Don't come any closer! Disappear! Get out of here! There is no food here.

The dragon walks a little closer to the father and suddenly gets the frying pan on him. It hits one part of the open jaw and the dragon whines as it hurts. The father throws the frying pan at the dragon and it hits the dragon's head with a bang. The dragon roars because its head hurts.

The whole family quickly enters the villa. The dragon remains and whines piteously, trying to get sympathy from the humans but it gets no sympathy at all, only hatred. After a short while, the dragon flies away.

The bright yellow dragon soon passes a forest where the bright blue and red dragon are arguing with each other. They have both found three people and they argue about whose food it is. The people are dead and they lie lifeless on the ground while the two dragons roar loudly at each other.

The bright yellow dragon lands and asks if they can take a human each. But the red dragon absolutely does not want that. The bright blue dragon thinks it's perfectly fine to do so. But the red dragon is stubborn. It's his food and no one else's. Finally, he spews hot fire at both the bright blue and the light yellow dragon.

Both the light yellow and bright blue dragon recoil and they fly away, leaving the red dragon with its three humans. The bright yellow dragon come to think that people are afraid of fire. It can be used against the mean father who threw a frying pan at him. What a great idea.

In M√∂lndal, the dark red dragon flies around and looks down on all the villas it passes. There are a lot of small villas that it passes right now and the dragon doesn't think they are worth any attention.

But after a while the dragon arrives at a large campsite. There are many tents, small houses and caravans on the campsite, but also several communal spaces in large burgundy houses. The kite flies low over the campsite and it is seen by several tourists and people swimming in the sea. Many people get scared when they see the giant dragon.

Most people who see the dragon seem to get angry at it and throw their fists at it and even throw hard objects at it. Only the kids seem to like the dragon. The dragon gets mad at those who throw things at him and he decides to take revenge.

The dragon presses against the organ with the gas and makes the movement in the throat at the same time as it has its jaw wide open.

Liquid hot fire shoots out from the dragon's wide open jaw and the fire hits a larger plastic tent. The plastic tent starts to burn strongly at the same time as the plastic melts around the tent. Luckily, there is no one in the tent when the fire starts. Those living in the tent cook in one of the five common areas. They have no idea that their tent is burning down. The dragon flies over the campsite.

The dragon spews more liquid fire from its wide open jaw. This time the dragon manages to spray the fire right into an open caravan. The fire floats around the caravan and ignites the interior and it starts to burn heavily. All fabric upholstery over sofas and wooden materials burn strongly

The family living in the caravan has not turned off the gas to the gas stove properly and it is not long before there is a violent explosion. The dragon flinches at the loud noise as the explosion occurs.

Soon the entire caravan catches fire and those who live in it do not manage to get out but are burned alive. The dragon can smell their burnt smell. After a while, the dragon flies on over the campsite.

The dragon spews liquid fire from its wide open jaw and this time it is in front of one of the small houses where people threw pots at it. The four pots are still on the ground when the dragon gets there and it spews its liquid fire into the small house. The house starts to burn immediately and the people who are in the house rush out in a wild panic. The dragon spews its liquid fire on the running humans and their clothes begin to burn violently. The dragon hates the humans for throwing pots at him. The people throw themselves on the ground to suffocate the flames but they fail to suffocate the fire and die after a short while.

The dragon lands on the ground and starts walking around the campsite. None of the tourists dare to do anything to the dragon. They have seen what it can do and they don't want to die.

The dragon spews its liquid fire at one of the houses that contains the largest common area. The house has recently been repainted and there is an explosion as the dragon's liquid fire splashes against the wood and ignites the outer walls of the house. The flames are soon high above one long side of the house and the high flames ignite the roof. The roof is repainted and the tall flames rising from the roof ignite several trees that have thick branches over the house. Soon the burning branches crash down onto the burning roof and the flames soon grow even larger as the two fires coalesce into a single large flame. Soon the fire on the trees rushes up to the crowns.

The dragon approaches the other long side of the house and spews its liquid fire through an open door to a large common area where there is an older Big TV and several games. The fire splashes everywhere and all the furnishings start to burn heavily and lots of black smoke billows out because there are only older chairs in the space. The chairs emit black and toxic smoke when they burn. When the inner ceiling starts to burn, the smoke becomes even blacker and thicker. The dragon flies up into the air again but it flies at a low altitude.

Once again the dragon spews its hot liquid fire and this time two larger contiguous tents are ignited by the dragon's fire. The floating fire floats around between the two tents, igniting everything that is combustible and the flames soon rise high from the two tents while black smoke billows from all the burning plastics and synthetics. Those who live in the two tents shop in Gothenburg city. They intend to see Bratzkidz at Liseberg and don't go back to the campsite until 17.00. Then nothing remains of the two tents. The dragon flies over the campsite but it change the direction a little.

The dragon spews its liquid fire as it flies. This time the fire hits several large trees. The trees stand near the beach. Some guests have hung their wet towels on the lower parts of the trees and the dragon's liquid fire ignites both the towels and the trees with a loud swoosh sound. Soon both trees are burning with high flames and it is not long before the fire has spread up to the crowns of the trees. Several burning branches fall on the dry grass that is around the trees and it also starts to burn. The dragon looks at the burning trees and flies on at the campsite

The dragon spews even more liquid fire. This time, it is the smaller house that contains common areas that the dragon spews its fire on. The dragon spews its liquid fire through an open door. Chairs, tables, TV sets and games start burning immediately. Soon, dark smoke billows from the space while tall flames lick the outside of the entrance. Soon the fire moves up to the roof of the house.

The dragon flies above the house and spews more fire. The liquid fire hits the roof and it flows down a wide house wall. Both the roof and the house wall begin to burn heavily. The fire soon burns so strongly that it sounds as if it is roaring. The dragon roars back at the fire and flies on into the campsite.

The dragon once again spews its liquid fire and this time it's a smaller tent that gets hit by the fire and it starts burning instantly. The young people who live in the tent are nearby and they see what is happening. There is no fire extinguisher nearby and they see their things burning up. However, they are glad that it was not in the tent when the dragon spewed its fire on it. The dragon leaves the fire-ravaged campsite and flies on.

Context: 4 months ago, nagkaroon ako ng ka-talking stage then recently lang sya nagdecide na ligawan ako. This guy (37 y.o) is 8 years older than me and NGSB sya. I thought things were okay since interested ako sa kanya, parang ako yung mas gumagawa ng way to work things out (e.g ako nag aaya na magsimba, nag iinitiate ng conversation, keeping the conversation alive). Nafifeel ko naman na he cares for me pag magkasama kami and once a week lang kami magkita since busy sya sa work like literal na super busy. Pero pag normal days, may mga araw na hindi nya ako minemessage kahit ano or kahit i-seen man lang yung last message ko sa kanya. Parang I feel na hindi sya masyadong nag eeffort sa'kin at hindi ko alam sa paanong paraan sya nanliligaw  Pag magkasama naman kami, i feel safe and secure. Very gentle and caring. Napakilala na ako sa family nya and mabait naman sila sa'kin.

Last December 30, may guy na nagmessage sa'kin. Naging crush ko sya before (5 years ago) and inaya ako magdinner. Pumayag ako magdinner kami sa mall and nag coffee kami after. I asked him anong reason nya ng pag-aaya ng dinner and he said na he likes me and matagal nya na daw gusto akong ayain kumain. Hindi pa natatapos yung coffee namin, inaaya nya na ako ulit for another date. Ang kaibahan dito sa 2nd guy, sya yung laging nag eeffort na imessage ako. Ilang beses nya na sinabi na excited na sya makita ako ulit and nung time na magkasama at magkausap kami, nafifeel ko talaga na interested sya sa'kin. And the way he looked at me, iba yung feeling talaga like feeling ko ang ganda ko sa paningin nya.

Attempts: I tried to talk to my friends. Some of them, ayaw kay guy 1 dahil hindi nga nag eeffort. Some of them naman sinasabi na bigyan ko ng chance si guy 1 since baka nag aadjust pa dahil NGSB nga.",2,1735731476.0,adviceph,9,1.0,False

1hr1bjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_fhchandigarh/comments/1hr1bjg/caffeine_and_weight_loss_does_coffee_really_speed/,Caffeine and Weight Loss: Does Coffee Really Speed Up Your Metabolism?,"Coffee, one of the most consumed beverages worldwide, is often touted as a potential aid in weight loss. While many people believe that their morning cup of coffee can help them shed a few extra pounds, the science behind caffeine's effects on metabolism and fat burning is more nuanced. Understanding the connection between coffee, caffeine, and weight loss requires a closer look at how caffeine influences the body‚Äôs metabolism and appetite regulation.  
  
**Caffeine‚Äôs Impact on Metabolism**  
Caffeine is a stimulant that can temporarily increase metabolism, the rate at which the body burns calories. When¬†taken, caffeine stimulates the central nervous system,¬†causing¬†an increase in heart rate and blood flow. This¬†increase¬†in activity can cause the body to burn more calories, even¬†when¬†resting. Some studies suggest that caffeine can increase the metabolic rate by 3-11%, with larger doses having a more noticeable effect.

Studies have shown that [*caffeine and metabolism*](https://foreverhealthy.in/the-truth-about-caffeine-and-metabolism/)¬†stimulates each other. It may help with weight loss.  
  
Another important aspect is that¬†the thermogenic effect of caffeine;¬†that¬†means¬†production of heat¬†within¬†the¬†human¬†body,¬†causes¬†loss¬†of¬†fat.¬†If¬†a¬†human¬†body¬†starts¬†to¬†burn¬†energy¬†for¬†creating¬†heat,¬†there¬†can¬†be¬†utilisation¬†of¬†reserved¬†fats¬†for creating this energy source.¬†That's the reason¬†this¬†drug¬†is¬†seen¬†in¬†most¬†supplements¬†as¬†a¬†'burning-fatty-tissues'¬†supplement;¬†yet¬†the¬†aftereffect¬†is¬†transient,¬†and¬†because¬†tolerance¬†builds,¬†effects¬†often¬†taper¬†off¬†with¬†habituation.

**Caffeine and Fat Oxidation**  
Caffeine¬†also¬†stimulates¬†fat oxidation,¬†which is¬†the¬†breakdown¬†of¬†fat¬†to¬†provide¬†energy¬†to¬†the¬†muscles.¬†Its¬†effect is¬†more¬†pronounced¬†during¬†exercise.¬†Experiments¬†have¬†proven¬†that caffeine¬†may¬†increase the amount of fat¬†burned¬†during exercise,¬†and¬†because¬†of¬†this¬†effect,¬†pre-exercise¬†supplements¬†often¬†contain¬†it. Thus, drinking¬†a cup of¬†coffee or¬†tea,¬†or taking a¬†caffeine¬†supplement¬†before¬†physical¬†activity,¬†might¬†actually¬†help¬†burn¬†a¬†bit¬†more fat during¬†exercise.  
  
However,¬†even¬†though¬†caffeine¬†stimulates¬†the¬†burning of¬†fat,¬†this¬†does not¬†imply¬†that¬†it¬†alone¬†results¬†in¬†noticeable¬†weight¬†loss. Weight loss is a¬†multifactorial¬†process:¬†diet, physical activity, and overall lifestyle¬†must be considered in a holistic sense.  
  
**Appetite Suppression¬†by¬†Caffeine**  
Some¬†people¬†also¬†associate¬†coffee¬†consumption with¬†weight loss¬†because¬†the¬†beverage¬†may¬†have¬†a lower chance of stimulating¬†appetite.¬†In¬†some studies,¬†caffeine may¬†minimize¬†the¬†feelings of hunger¬†because¬†it¬†seems¬†to affect¬†hunger hormones¬†such¬†as¬†ghrelin, the hormone¬†that¬†triggers¬†the¬†sensation of¬†hunger. This¬†effect¬†is¬†only¬†short-term¬†and¬†may not be significant¬†to¬†lead¬†to¬†significant¬†weight loss¬†if¬†other lifestyle changes¬†are not implemented.  
  
**Potential Side Effects of Caffeine Consumption**  
Although¬†caffeine¬†may¬†stimulate¬†metabolism and¬†burning¬†of fats, it¬†has¬†a¬†downside.¬†Taking¬†high¬†levels of¬†caffeine,¬†mainly¬†in the form of coffee,¬†leads¬†to¬†effects¬†like¬†increased anxiety, jitteriness, sleep¬†disturbance, and¬†even¬†digestive issues.¬†Such¬†side effects¬†are¬†very¬†devastating¬†for¬†people¬†taking¬†excessive¬†amounts¬†of¬†coffee¬†or¬†have¬†sensitivity¬†to caffeine.  
  
Additionally,¬†if¬†sugar, cream, or flavored syrups¬†are added¬†to coffee,¬†then¬†the¬†beverage¬†can¬†be¬†transformed¬†overnight¬†from¬†a¬†potential weight-loss¬†tool¬†to¬†a¬†high-calorie¬†drink.¬†A¬†more¬†direct¬†path¬†toward¬†the¬†metabolic¬†benefits¬†would be¬†to¬†drink¬†coffee¬†black or with minimal additives.  


Ultimately, drinking coffee can be a¬†useful¬†supplement¬†to a weight loss¬†program¬†but¬†should not be relied upon as the sole strategy for¬†losing¬†weight.¬†Moderation is¬†always¬†key, and¬†knowledge¬†of¬†the science¬†that works¬†behind caffeine¬†will¬†allow¬†you¬†to¬†bestow¬†this¬†choice¬†with¬†caution.",1,1735731444.0,u_fhchandigarh,0,1.0,False

","# What are remote work practices?

Remote work practices are ways in which people who work in a different location from their office can remain productive, efficient and motivated. The different dynamic between working in a dedicated workspace and doing so at home or in a public place means there are usually more elements that can distract you and reduce your work performance. By implementing remote work practices, you are reducing the odds of the quality of your work suffering because you are not performing it in a dedicated space.What are remote work practices?



# Best remote working practices

Consider these 13 practices for improving your productivity and consistency while working remotely:

# 1. Have a clear daily routine

Although remote work is usually more flexible than office work regarding working hours, setting up a routine based on the work you must perform and your personal preferences can significantly increase your productivity. If you can set up your own daily schedule, you should do so based on work priorities, but also your natural inclinations. For example, if you are not an energetic person in the morning you can set up a routine where you handle your most difficult tasks after lunch.

# 2. Create boundaries between office time and personal time

The potential lack of a fixed schedule may indicate to coworkers, clients and anyone needing to communicate with you for professional purposes that you are available even outside office hours. Having a clear boundary between personal time and work can help you mentally by allowing you to fully relax during your personal hours, but also helps you avoid disappointing a colleague or client who may be expecting you to be on call in a situation when you're not.**Related:**¬†**Remote Work Resume: Templates and Samples**

# 3. Make sure you can rely on your devices

Although internet connections and internet-connected devices are constantly improving, technical issues can still occur, especially if they are not set up properly. Depending on the exact nature of your work, you should make sure you have all the software and hardware you need to perform. A fast and stable internet connection is typically a common necessity for remote workers, with other potentially important tech being appropriate software, noise-cancelling headphones for those working in loud places, dual monitors, quality keyboards and others.

# 4. Make sure that those around you understand what you do

Outside distractions caused by the people around them are usually a major issue for remote workers. Those who are constantly near you while you work, like family members for those working from home, need to know what your working hours are and whether or not they can interact with you during that time. The best option for those who can't or won't work from home is joining a coworking space with like-minded professionals. This space could be specifically set up for remote work, but also a local coffee shop with a reputation for accepting and encouraging remote workers.

# 5. Constantly communicate with coworkers and managers

Classic office settings make communicating with office peers and superiors easy and natural, but when you are working from a different location you may tend to communicate less. Doing so can be detrimental to your work objectives, as most tasks are better performed as a team. You should proactively seek to communicate with everyone you work with, so you can be sure you are all working towards the same goal.

# 6. Dress for work

Although working from home or a caf√© allows you to look and dress as you please, making an effort to appear professional subconsciously puts you in a professional state of mind and your overall productivity is likely to increase as a result. Try to dress like you are going to the office, even though no one sees you.

# 7. Plan your tasks

Remote workers are generally less micromanaged by their superiors, compared to those who work in traditional workplaces. Although this allows you more flexibility in how you arrange your schedule, not having a manager outline your tasks for you can lead to a lack of organization. You should avoid that by planning out your schedule and goals well in advance, whenever possible.**Related:**¬†**How To Transition From Remote to Onsite Work**

# 8. Learn and practice online meeting etiquette

As opposed to in-person meetings, where it is relatively easy to maintain good standards of interaction and communication, online meetings require a proactive approach to etiquette. Aside from dressing appropriately, you should make sure that no participants are experiencing technical errors and that your camera is well-lit. Also, if you have a presentation to make, you should take advantage of the online environment and send everyone a document with the major points you would be touching upon.

# 9. Make time for social interactions

Traditional workplaces usually ensure a certain level of social interaction between coworkers, which can have psychological benefits for those involved. When working remotely, however, you need to proactively make time to meet and communicate with people. Spending too much time alone and indoors can have negative effects on both the mind and body.

# 10. Keep yourself accountable

Most people working in offices or other classic workplaces have managers to keep them focused and accountable. This way, workers are not tempted to spend the time reserved for work on other unrelated activities. When you work remotely, however, there is no physical presence to watch over you and help you avoid different temptations, like chatting online with a friend or reading a website unrelated to work. You are your own manager and you need to find ways to keep yourself accountable during office hours.

# 11. Make sure you know what is and isn't your responsibility

When working remotely on a team project, it can be difficult to determine exactly what each member of the team is responsible for. Before starting a new project, communicate with all the other people involved and clearly establish what everyone is responsible for within the project. This way you can avoid future miscommunications.

# 12. Watch your health

Working in a traditional office typically implies getting dressed, leaving the house and physically going to work. Also, after work, people are generally more likely to have other activities, since they are already out of the house. Remote workers, however, don't need to spend the energy required to get to work and may lack a normal routine that involves regular meals, staying hydrated or going to a gym after work. This means you not only require self-discipline for professional reasons, but also for staying active and energetic.**Related:**¬†**How To Ask To Work Remotely Full-Time: Steps and Tips**

# 13. Meet your coworkers face to face regularly

Remote workers who live in the same geographical area should have occasional meetings, as this can lead to stronger relationships and better online communication afterward. Even something as simple as meeting your manager for lunch once a month can resolve potential communication issues created by the online environment, as people tend to speak more freely in  remote working practices",1,1735731214.0,freelancesuccesshub,0,1.0,False

1hr193l,https://www.reddit.com/r/DragonLifestory/comments/1hr193l/chapter_04/,Chapter 04,"The next day dawns and in the cave the dragon queen is almost in the far right part of the cave and she is full of eggs that she will soon start laying. The dragon queen lies on her belly and waits for the time to lay her eggs.

She is extremely fat so there must be a lot of eggs in there. The dragon queen can feel how the eggs are constantly pressing against her abdomen and anus and she finds it a bit annoying. But she knows that she will soon be rid of them and she focuses on that thought.

The male is nearby, guarding. The dragon queen is vulnerable once she starts laying her eggs and the male instinctively knows that this is so. Both the dragon queen and the male have heard people nearby so they are really suspicious of anything they hear outside the cave.

The dragon queen's abdomen begins to twitch and there are small contractions down by the anus. The dragon queen starts to get up but feels that no, it's probably not time yet. The abdomen twitches a few times. The dragon queen yawns and waits some more.

After a while the contractions in the abdomen start again and the contractions at the anus appear more often and get bigger each time. The Dragon Queen starts to get up but regrets it again.

The dragon queen suddenly has a contraction so strong that her whole body jerks. Look, now things are happening, she thinks. It feels as if some egg is starting to push out from the anus. She withdraws the egg but it soon comes out again just the same. She again withdraws the egg but it is stubborn and soon enough it comes out again.

The dragon queen gets up. She feels it's time to lay the eggs now. She walks over to the first nest and directs her anus towards it. The male is quickly in front and sprays fire on the stones and in the bottom of the nest. The combustibles at the bottom start burning immediately. The male stands on the other side of the nest so he can easily see both the abdomen and the anus of the dragon queen

It doesn't take many seconds before the first 5 eggs pop out of the dragon queen's anus and land in the first nest. The white eggs tumble into the nest and they are warm and they land with the top side up. It is not positive if they land on the side because the dragon embryo cannot grow properly then. The laying of the dragon queen's eggs is a bit like when sea turtles lay their eggs. The biggest difference is, of course, that the eggs are larger and that more come out at once than in sea turtles.

There is a slight wet sound from the anus as each egg is released. This is because the eggs are covered with a tough mucus and it is the mucus that is heard the most when it bubbles out of the anus together with the eggs. For the dragon queen, it is a very positive sound. When the dragon queen pops out the eggs, she has one hind leg raised, but as soon as she stops popping them out, she lowers the leg again.

The male sprays super hot fire on the stones. The dragon embryo in the eggs grows very quickly and is ready to hatch after about a day or less, but the heat must be right if it is to happen. The baby dragons that hatch will be about the size of a Golden Retriver dog.

Shortly after the first five eggs are laid, a transparent mucus first drips and later flows from the dragon queen's anus. The clear slime is similar to regular water but it has lots of little bubbles in it and water usually doesn't have that unless it's carbonated. The mucus gives the eggs extra protection and also lubricates the anus so that the eggs will come out more easily through the opening. The male becomes curious when he sees the slime flowing from the dragon queen's anus. 

Several strong contractions are visible in the anus and 10 eggs come out at once.

The dragon queen helps and pushes the eggs out so that more eggs come out at the same time. She has very strong muscles in her anus. The wet sound is heard all the time as the eggs pop out. Since the male stands behind the dragon queen's anus, he watches as each egg pops out. He can also see when they are filled from the abdomen. Each egg looks like a bump and they keep moving towards the anus without stopping. If he stood in front of her, he wouldn't be able to see it at all. The male gently feels the eggs. They are warm and slightly moist.

A big contraction in the anus is visible almost immediately after the 10 eggs come out and 5 eggs pop out without a break.

Now there are 20 eggs in the first nest and the dragon queen moves to the second nest. She pinches the anus so that no egg can fall out on its own. She directs her anus towards the center of the other nest. She feels several contractions in her anus and knows that several eggs will arrive soon.

The dragon queen stands and waits impatiently for the male to spray fire in the middle of the nest and on the rocks, and soon he sprays the hot fire on the stones and in the middle of the nest and the dragon queen can continue to lay her eggs.

Several large contractions are seen in the dragon queen's anus and this time she lays 20 eggs without any pause. There is more pressure on the eggs this time.

The eggs first thump hard in the nest due to the high pressure from the anus, but when the nest starts to fill up, the sound is muffled. The male almost gets several of the eggs on himself because he is so close to where the eggs pop out. Some of the eggs are close to hitting his jaws.

It wouldn't have been good if some eggs ended up in the jaw and the male realizes that he is mostly in the way when he is standing right behind the anus. But he likes to see the eggs pop out and the eggs also smell very good when the dragon queen lays them.

The dragon queen moves to the third nest and directs her anus into the nest. The male is quickly in front and sprays fire on the rocks and at the bottom of the nest. The male can see that several bumps are on their way to the anus. The eggs move really fast. There are still many eggs left to lay for the dragon queen. The contractions in the anus continue without interruption and after a few seconds another 20 eggs come without a break.

The eggs thump hard in the nest due to the high pressure in the abdomen and anus, but the dragon queen knows that the eggs can withstand relatively mild treatment without cracking and breaking. The male thinks it looks funny when the eggs have such speed from the dragon queen's anus. A few times the eggs come out so fast that the mucus that flows from the anus splashes in all directions. 

The dragon queen moves to the fourth nest and directs her anus towards the center of the nest. Again, the male helps and sprays fire so that it gets warm enough in the nest. The male can see several lumps moving from the abdomen to the anus but they do not appear to be many and they are moving more slowly this time. Strong contractions are soon visible in the dragon queen's anus and after a few seconds the last 10 eggs come out in rabid succession.

There are no more twitches or contractions in the abdomen and the mucus stops flowing and becomes drops that come out occasionally. There are also no bumps in the abdomen anymore. The male knows that all the eggs have been laid. The dragon queen turns around and counts all the eggs she has laid. There were 70 eggs. She feels very pleased with herself.

The male counts the eggs and concludes that there are 70 of them. He is impressed that there are so many considering they are so big. The dragon queen looks at her four nests with all the eggs she has laid and again sprays hot fire on all the rocks around the four nests. The male walks around the nest and stands next to his dragon queen. He really likes her. The two coo at each other.

Just as the dragon queen has laid her last eggs, some uniformed policemen knock on Hasse's door. They want to talk to him. Hasse is almost naked but he lets the police in and they go around and check his villa while he puts on clothes. A male policeman stands guard at the bedroom door while he gets dressed. When Hasse is dressed, he goes out to the police.

\- How good that you are dressed. We would like to talk to you a bit.

\- Okay. Do you want coffee or something?

\- No thanks. You may come along to the station for questioning.

\- Can't we have the interrogation here instead?

\- We have technical equipment at the police station so it is better to keep it there.

\- I'm a little hungry and need some food first.

\- We have a cafeteria in the police station, so we can fix both drinks and food for you there.

\- Yeah. okay. I just have to lock the villa door first and then i can follow you

\- It's not necessary. Two colleagues stay here and look around.

\- Am I suspected of something?

\- We'll take it when we arrive. Do you intend to be calm in the police car?

\- Why wouldn't I be?

\- We don't know much about you yet. Right. Looks like no handcuffs are needed on this person. Preliminary investigation started by Mats Olofsson at 8.45am.

Hasse accompanies the three police officers to the car, while two remain in his villa. Two of the policemen sit there in the front and one sits down next to Hasse.

\- Nice hairstyle you have.

\- I didn't choose it myself. A friend recently cut my hair.

\- Oh i see

The policeman sitting next to Hasse notes something on a post it note. The police car doesn't have the red light and alarm on, and Hasse thinks it's nice. He wonders what the neighbors would think if they saw him getting into the police car. The journey to the police station is quite quick. They park in the garage and let Hasse out.

They go up three floors and end up in a long corridor where there are only a lot of interrogation rooms and offices. On one of the doors is the name Mats Olofsson and the police lead Hasse in there and they ask him to sit down. The three policemen stand outside the door and talk to each other for a while.

Meanwhile in the cave near √Öby, both the male and the dragon queen are hungry. The dragon queen is probably most hungry after laying all the eggs. Her big stomach and belly look really thin but they are big and hold a lot of food and eggs. Both dragons walk over to their food supply to check what they are craving for food. Both the male and the dragon queen choose a cow. They each pull a cow out of the food supply and start eating them.

The male bites off the head of a cow he caught the previous day and he breaks the cow's horns with his claws. He doesn't know if they can get stuck in his throat. The male picks up the cow's head with his teeth and swallows it down. The cow is dead and completely still so the male can eat it in peace.

The dragon queen smashes the horns of another cow that the male has fetched but she chooses to turn the cow over and rip open the cow's belly and eat its entrails. They are very long and somewhat reminiscent of slimy thick sausages. The entrails slurp into her large jaw as she pulls them out of the cow's belly and swallows them. She ingests a lot of plant material, but her stomach can handle that as well. Soon she reaches the good and tender meat.

When the cow's head has been swallowed, the male chooses to take the left front leg of the cow. He jerks and tears until it comes loose and swallows it. He then takes the right front leg. It is also pulled away and swallowed. There isn't a lot of meat in the cow's legs but the male has planned to eat the whole cow so it doesn't matter.

The dragon queen is still eating from the cow's belly. There is only very good tender meat here. The entrails she swallowed have just come down into the big stomach so the small stomach can be filled with new food. The reason the entrails came down so quickly is because tiny sensors in the stomach sensed that they didn't have to go through as much prep work as the humans did the day before.

The male has also turned on the cow that he is feeding on and he begins to open the cow's abdomen. Here there is most of the cow that does not consist of bones but only tender meat. The male dives down with his big jaw and begins to feast on everything good that he sees. He doesn't even raise his head when he swallows, but bite after bite can be seen sliding down his throat. He only gets up when the first stomach is almost full.

He stands and waits impatiently for all the meat to be released into the big belly so he can continue to feast on the good meat and all the organs that lie there and shine. The male drools because the meat both smells and tastes very good. After a short while, the male dives down again with his big jaw.

This time he eats the cow's intestines. He accidentally punctures the cow's gut while it's on its way into his jaws and green plant material sprays out in all directions but the male doesn't care. The male doesn't have very good table manners, but since the dragon queen doesn't protest, it's nothing that the male even thinks about.

The dragon queen takes it a little more calmly and doesn't feast like the male does. She has significantly better table manners. They have all the time in the world to eat the cows and she sees no reason to hurry. The eggs will only hatch the next day.

Meanwhile, at the police station in central Gothenburg, Mats Olofsson has picked up three rolls with ham on them and two cups of coffee and a large cinnamon bun. He has everything on a tray and he walks in to Hasse who is sitting on a chair. Mats places the tray in front of Hasse and nods at him. Hasse is hungry and eats the three rolls immediately and drinks the first cup but saves the cinnamon roll and the second cup for later. Mats turns on his tape recorder and starts recording on it.

\- Yeah. Then there was an interrogation with Hasse Jespersson regarding events with a dragon at Liseberg. You and the dragon are suspected of public vandalism. How do you approach it?

\- Yes. I do not know. I didn't do any damage myself. It was the dragon who did it.

\- But it was you who took the dragon into the park with you. We have seen that on the surveillance cameras.

\- Yes it's true

\- Where does the dragon come from in the first place?

\- It and another dragon hatched from two eggs I found recently while taking a walk.

\- So two dragons have been living with you for a while?

\- Just a few days. They have grown really fast.

\- Why did you bring the dragon to the park?

\- It chased the female all the time and I felt she needed to be left alone for a while. I saw the ad for furries and thought the dragon could fit in there.

\- So.. The dragon you brought with you was a male. How do you know it was a male?

\- I saw his private parts. You know, like male animals have. The other one had nothing like that so I understood it was a female.

\- It is already sexually active?

\- I think so, but it also seemed like a game between the two.

\- Where are the dragons now?

\- I have let them loose because they got too big to keep indoors. They sprayed some fire inside and then this incident happened in the park.

Mats scratches his head and turns off the tape player. He opens the door and walks further down the corridor and knocks on a door there. The door soon opens and Hasse hears Mats and another person talking to each other. Hasse cannot hear what they are saying.

Meanwhile in the cave, the dragon queen has just eaten the whole cow and she licks her jaw clean with her long tongue. The male has gotten down to the bottom of the cow's underside but right now he is taking a short break while he waits for the meat and organs to be released into the big belly. There is not much meat and organs left in the bottom of the cow and he starts to feel full but he intends to eat the whole cow anyway.

Two minutes later, the food has flowed down into the large stomach and the male continues to feast on the meat that remains in the cow. The male's jaws are smeared with blood and plant matter that was in the cow's intestine. He hasn't licked his jaws yet. The dragon queen begins to walk further into the cave. She continues to spray hot fire on the rocks at each nest.

Mats comes back to the room and he has a colleague with him. The colleague sits down on a chair near Hasse.

\- We need to find those two dragons as soon as possible. Where did you find the eggs?

Hasse intends to tell where he found the eggs but regrets it. The dragons probably aren't there anyway, so he says another place.

\- Um. It was near Hisingsparken that I found them. There was some smaller cave nearby.

\- Where in the park was this?

\- Somewhere in the middle.

The colleague nods to himself.

\- I think I know where he means somewhere. Thanks.

The colleague leaves the room and goes back to his room. Mats stays behind and starts the tape recorder again.

\- Your dragon spewed fire on two young people at the restaurant. Can you tell me what happened?

\- Well, the young guys started annoying me and the dragon and i told them to leave us alone but then one of the guys walked to the dragon and teased it and it spewed fire on him.

\- I see. Well the kids say they hadnt provoked the dragon.

\- Thats a lie. There were witness who saw this.

\- Its not the story we have been told but i guess they didnt like your dragon

\- I see. I could have guessed some people wouldn¬¥t tell the thruth about this. What kind of damages are they claiming?

\- They want you to pay mainly for the fire damage and the glass ceiling that the dragon broke. Some want all the money back for the entrance fee.

\- How much will it cost?

\- It's hard to know, but the most important thing right now is that the dragons are found and killed before they start to multiply.

\- Do I have to stay here until the dragons are found?

\- No. You can go home when the interrogation is over. I just have a few questions left.

\- Did the dragons mate when they lived with you?

\- No. They didn't seem that sexually active. They were probably just playing

\- Mmm. If you should see the dragons, will you call us?

\- I can do that.

\- Yes you should. They must be found immediately. The interrogation is over.

Hasse is released by the police and after a while he goes to the bus stop closest to the police and goes home to M√∂lndal.

The investigating officers are still in the house when he gets home, but they soon set off in search of the two dragons. Hasse walks around his villa. The cops don't seem to have touched much of his stuff. He lays down in his bed and rests a bit.

At the same time Hasse comes home the dragons have eaten their meat and the male decides to fly a bit. He flies out of the cave and flies upwards and soon up in the air he starts doing many sharp turns and several loops high in the air. 

During the time that the male flies and makes loops, Hisingsparken is filled with a lot of people. They look like ordinary people but they are from the defense. In order not to worry people, they have dressed so that people do not know they are from the defense. They are intensively searching for caves and other places where the two dragons may be. But so far they haven't found anything.

The male has finished flying and starts to land inside the cave but he involuntarily flies on the two skeletons at the beginning of the cave and they collapse. The dragon queen hears the noise and quickly comes towards the entrance to see what it was. She calms down when she sees that it was only the male that flew on the skeletons

The male goes further into the cave and cuddles with the dragon queen. After some cuddling the male lies next to the dragon queen and rests. She looks at him lovingly before walking away towards the right part of the cave and continuing to spray hot fire on the rocks by the four nests.

While the male rests and the dragon queen sprays fire on the rocks, several planes take off. Those in the plane are looking for caves and it is decided that they can fly over all of Gothenburg and all the villages and communities. The places where there appear to be caves are marked and through walkie-talkies it is relayed to several groups that are on the ground looking. The groups that are on the ground go on foot. It is important to find the dragons as soon as possible.

Some plane flies right over the hill at √Öby where the cave is but the pilots don't think it looks like a cave there so the dragons remain undetected. On the other hand, there are several people who walk further away in the area, but they never pass so close that they discover the opening. The dragon queen hears them and she moves uneasily.

At home in M√∂lndal, Hasse hasn't done much during the rest of the day. He watches TV in the evening and reads a book about dragons that he finds on the internet. Not much matches the dragons that hatched with him and he gives up and goes to bed around 10pm.

Day turns into evening and night. In the cave, the dragon queen continues to spray fire on the stones around the four nests so that the temperature will be right. The male has rested and helps out by spewing fire a little now and then. It will be so exciting when the eggs hatch.",1,1735731128.0,DragonLifestory,0,1.0,False

1hr17y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1hr17y7/entitled_exboss_wants_me_back/,Entitled ex-boss wants me back,"Several months ago I picked up a side job at a local bar/cafe. It's quite a popular place and my sister and I used to go in a lot since she's friendly with the landlady - we were talking about her looking for help behind the bar one day a week in the evenings and I agreed to give it a go after she posed the offer to me. I was going through a bit of a stagnant phase in life and thought it could be fun and worth the extra money; although I already work full time it's hybrid so I have more flexibility around things outside the office and she said she understood if other work commitments needed prioritising.

I have never worked in a bar/done barista before, and there was absolutely zero proper training - my first shift the landlady showed me where everything was and immediately got me on serving customers while she dissappeared off to do other things. I knew next to nothing about what wines or beers we had on stock, how to measure and pour all the different drinks, enter all the items correctly on the till, how to navigate the coffee machine (I burned myself on the steamer more times than I care to remember) but the regulars gave me plenty of grace and advice and I muddled through.

I stuck it out since the extra cash in my pocket certainly didn't hurt, but it was stressful and physically demanding even at the best of times.

It was often loud and busy in there, with live music or karaoke playing, you'd be on your feet constantly running back and forth, bending and lifting heavy crates in and out of the dishwasher, getting your clothes and shoes soaked with beer - it was a tiny space behind the bar and the landlady seemed to have zero spatial awareness so she'd bustle in behind you to grab things while you were in the middle of serving, knocking past your elbows while you're trying to pour, squashing you into the beer taps, tripping you and blocking you in while she stood to talk to people and expecting you to contort around her with your hands full of pints or hot drinks.

She also had a habit of telling you off about doing stuff wrong - either something she'd never bothered to show you properly, or that you'd been doing the way she showed you for weeks. Like she'd just decide on a whim she wanted something doing differently and you were expected to know and immediately correct it. She'd pull me aside to lecture me about the most random things like the volume I was talking over the bar, the type of mug I used for someone's tea or the way I arranged the candles on the table.

My agreed shift was 6 -11pm close, but we often didn't finish until gone half 11 since the landlady would let regulars stay longer or extend last orders when it was busy, and she would let me go closer to midnight a lot of the time, knowing I'd been at work all day, and that I was going to be up for work again the following morning.

I got added to the staff whatsapp group 'to keep up to date' and it was mostly a stream of passive-aggressive essays from the landlady randomly updating all the shift/bar rules and expecting everyone to follow along, or calling everyone out on how things were being done wrong (since she didn't actually train anyone properly it just got ignored). Instead of planning cover for events she expected everyone to just be able to pitch in to pick up the slack, would frequently be asking for people to stay longer or pick up extra hours and there was always a sense of urgency and guilt tripping around it like 'we really need everyone to pull together and help out guys'. Most of the other staff were part time and had other full time jobs or commitments like me. She would message me individually asking if I could do extra shifts as well, or wait to pitch last minute requests on me in person, hoping I'd say yes if she put me on the spot. A couple of times I caved because I had the free time and energy, and conveniently those shifts always ended up being the most busy and stressful.

There were a handful of people who the landlady let in that were barred from all the other places in town, like this alcoholic woman who always made weird comments about your appearance and tried to reach out and grope you inappropriately, the middle aged married man who sat at the bar leering and making gross misogynistic jokes and asking all the girls for hugs, the dodgy group of lads who were always off their faces, trying to intimidate and threaten people and start fights. The landlady never seemed bothered about any of this and wouldn't really support us if me or other staff brought up feeling uncomfortable when they came in, in fact she'd often continue to enable them by giving them what they wanted. 

She started to take liberties leaving staff on their own and would put her partner in charge while she went off on holiday, but he knew nothing about running the place and would just disappear off for ages, so if it was a busy shift you were totally on your own. There were so many times I was forced to do things I didn't feel safe or comfortable doing, like leaving the bar and till completely unattended to make food in the kitchen or having to lift and carry massive crates of drinks and empty glass across the slippery paved courtyard in the rain. There was absolutely no planning for the volume of customers we would regularly have to manage alone, and could easily have 30+ people on an evening packed into the bar area.

The last few months I was under a huge amount of extra unexpected stress and pressure from my regular job, so I think the landlady could tell I was getting burned out but she rarely tried to check in or ask how I was doing. I went through a phase of suffering panic attacks quite badly a few years ago, and I had my first one in ages in the middle of a shift at the pub when nobody was around to help - I also had to go to my doctors a few times in as many months because I kept breaking out in odd rashes, probably from stress, and the medication they put me on was making me incredibly nauseous if I didn't eat at regular intervals. Which I wasn't doing. Or sleeping.

I kind of hit rock bottom after a horrendous couple of weeks at work around November time, big organisational changes dropped on us without warning, multiple days of overtime and working through lunches/not getting up from my desk or seeing sunlight for hours while more and more things continuously got piled on me and everyone else involved is conveniently out of office. I asked the landlady if I could swap out my next shift to give me a break which is something I absolutely hate doing, and she told me she wasn't going to be there so 'couldn't help me out'. No-one else was available so I had to go in, and it ended up being one of the busiest nights I'd had, the landlady's partner of course was nowhere to be seen so I was left to drown.

It was so stressful that within the first hour some of the regular customers kept coming to ask if I was OK because I must've looked like I was on the verge of having a breakdown, I couldn't hold a glass steady or even make eye contact when they were speaking to me. At some point, I honestly wasn't even aware of time passing, the landlady's partner decided to appear to grab his coat, told me he was going home to have dinner, and fucked off until closing.

A couple of days later, I got a message from the landlady asking if I was available to take an extra shift on Saturday, and that broke me. I told her no but that I would drop in to see her after work, and I think she could tell something was up from that because when I came in and asked her for a chat, she pretty much immediately (and bluntly) asked me if I wanted to quit.

I was quite stunned by her attitude, not sure if she was angry, or if I should be angry about her being angry, but I kept my cool and we had a brief conversation about things. She didn't put up any fight, just offered to keep me on the group chat 'incase I ever wanted to pick up the odd shift here and there' - I told her I'd need some time to think about that. I stayed for a quick drink and went home to try and enjoy my weekend off.

It's been about a month and a half since then and I haven't been in or heard anything from the landlady. Then just before Christmas my sister convinced me to go in for a drink with her, and I was chatting to one of the girls behind the bar and just saying hi to a few people when she walks in and upon seeing me, immediately goes 'oh hi, so when are you coming back then?' I just laughed it off and ignored her, as I currently have no intention of going back at all.

Come Monday, I have just got back from a weekend away seeing family and am straight back at work. It's been so busy I haven't been able to take any time off between the bank holidays so I've been trying to fit in travelling and other plans around that which is stressful enough - I look at my phone and notice a message from the landlady asking if I'm free the next day (new year's eve) to come in and do a shift in the middle of the day, because apparently she has loads of staff off and can't find anyone and she's desperate. Then she tops it off with 'and let's have a chat about you coming back in the new year'. I am completely dumbfounded by this message as she's not even reached out to me until now, and it's a normal weekday so she knows I'm working.

I just ignored the message, and yesterday I noticed it had been deleted from the chat history. My sister went in for a drink there last night and she's just messaged me this morning saying the landlady was asking about me and that she 'missed me yesterday'- sure thing.

Personally I don't think I'll be going back in there for a good long while.",16,1735730988.0,EntitledPeople,9,0.79,False

He was very scathing and critical when describing Jay Leno and his audience.

Yes I myself did notice it uses a quite stereotypical format and I also did notice it's simplified mass appeal. 

But for me as an african it was quite a treat to see a typical ""american"" late night show. For one thing you had to have pay tv to watch it, and also you had to stay up very late at night to see it air live. Also I felt the jokes were very 'classical' type comedian jokes. I also liked how everybody whore suits and the live jazz band and the background with the stylised city nightline. Even the coffee cups on the desk that are never drank from. And also I didn't think it's audience was dumb, I just thought the show catered to people from the middle of America. The one's who drive pickup trucks and work in the trades. Not very academic and cerebral people but very authentic and tough and possessing practical wisdom. I saw nothing wrong with The Jay Leno Show.

So imagine my surprise when years later he has Jay Leno on his podcast and has nothing but _*nice*_ things to say to him. He gave him a huge compliment on his car and motorcycle collection. While saying nothing about what he thinks of the kind of work that made it all possible! And not once did he bring up how people can like comedy that's so poor in his own eyes.

And speaking of poor comedy if I was him I would be the very last person to ever criticise another comedian. Leno's comedy is very basic but atleast it's funny in a very simple way. But Rogan's comedy is not funny in any kind of way. Simple or intelligent. So who is he to judge? 

And also Joe always says he is just a moron. And according to him Leno's audience is dumb. So why is the pot calling the kettle black? Shouldn't he have empathy for Leno's audience? They're both not smart. So why is he judging them for being what he also is?

Ever since then I knew something was off about Joe.

1hr16fv,https://www.reddit.com/r/DragonLifestory/comments/1hr16fv/chapter_01/,Chapter 01,"Hasse Jespersson is a lively and curious 39-year-old man who lives in M√∂lndal just outside Gothenburg. He has been married to a woman named Kerstin but the marriage never worked very well so they divorced after three years together but he has chosen to stay in the house they bought together. They unfortunately never had any children together. Hasse enjoys both the house and the small community in which he lives.

M√∂lndal is a quiet community but still so close to Gothenburg that it's easy to drive to the big city and shop and, of course, go to Liseberg. Hasse doesn't ride any attractions, but usually just walks around the park and looks at all the people and meets friends.

Sometimes he goes to concerts and drinks beer with those he hangs out with the most. There are also many shops in town where he buys groceries and other things, but it also happens that he shops in his nearest ICA store so that it can still be open.

One beautiful day in June 2025, Hasse is out walking in a forest that borders √Öby. √Öby is also a small community and is smaller than M√∂lndal.

Hasse loves to go for long walks. On the one hand, it is nice to get fresh air, but it also strengthens the mind and heart. Kerstin also liked long walks. Hasse never listens to music when he walks, but only to all the sounds of nature.

Hasse has never walked in this forest before, but he finds it exciting. This forest is really old. He can see that. It doesn't seem like that many kids have been here and messed up. The path he walks on is full of moss. Sometimes the path is rocky, but often it is completely green and soft from all the moss. A few woodpeckers are pecking at some tree nearby.

Further along the forest road where Hasse walks is a very high hill. There is something about it that attracts him. Hasse walks towards the hill and is soon at the top of it and he enjoys the view. Hasse can see very far into the forest from the high hill. Hasse thinks that the next time he comes here, he will bring a coffee basket and sit on the hill and have a coffee. Hasse starts going down the hill, although not from the same direction he went up it.

On the way down from the hill, Hasse steps on a bed of leaves and green moss and suddenly he feels himself falling down and everything rushes past his face. Finally he has solid ground under his feet but he is under the hill in a kind of cave. It's really dark down there. Hasse looks up at the hole where he fell down and hopes he doesn't have to climb up there to get out of the cave.

After a while, Hasse's eyes have gotten used to the darkness and can see that the cave he fell into is huge. He wants to be able to see a little better so he doesn't run into something hard and hurt himself. Hasse knows that there is a flashlight function on the mobile phone that he can use. Hasse takes his cell phone out of his trouser pocket and logs in so that the menu with different choices appears. Hasse sees to his disappointment that there is no phone coverage in the cave so he cannot call anyone. But the flashlight in the mobile works as it should.

The floor of the cave consists of small hard stones and they are easy to walk on. Hasse discovers something strange about the stones. It looks like quite a few of them are burnt and sooty from heavy fire but the funny thing is that the fire trails are not at all what it looks like when using a fireplace.

It looks more like someone used a flamethrower and sprayed the fire in all possible directions. Hasse doesn't understand how it can be like that. Such flamethrowers have not been around for a long time and it seems that it has been a long time since anyone was here last. A thick gray blanket of dust covers every available surface.

Hasse continues to walk around the huge cave and while he is exploring it, he is also looking for an exit. Finally he comes to a place where the cave divides to the left and to the right. Hasse chooses to go to the right. The further in he gets, the fewer the signs that someone has been here and after a while he goes back where the cave splits and chooses to go left instead.

The cave is both very large and deep and it takes a while, but eventually Hasse arrives at a type of stone or cement wall that someone has blocked the opening with. Hasse can see how daylight comes in through holes and cracks in the wall. Hasse soon notices that he is not alone at the wall. There are two huge skeletons right by the wall.

The huge skeletons are terrifying and Hasse feels his heart rate go up when he looks at the skeletons. They resemble dinosaurs but still not quite. Up on their heads he sees long and huge horns on one skeleton while the other has short and small horns. The skeleton with the long horns is the larger of the two. He can also see its huge fangs. They look unreasonably sharp. On both sides of the large skeletons, it looks like wing bones are sticking out very far. There were flying lizards in the time of the dinosaurs, but they weren't this big.

Hasse feels the hard and bare legs with his hand. He concludes that they must have had enormous muscles to be able to use their wings. Hasse takes several pictures of the skeletons with his mobile and he uses different angles so that as much of them as possible will be included in the picture.

Hasse feels the sharp fangs with his fingers and they make a small hole in one of his fingers and a little blood flows out from the hole they made. The horns are not as sharp as the fangs. He also feels a little in the large chests and a little in other places. Whatever the animals were, they were built to last well. They must have been fearsome predators when they were alive. Hasse turns away from the animals.

Hasse walks up to the wall and presses hard on it. After a little while, the whole wall collapses with a loud crash and Hasse can get out of here. Hasse starts to walk out of the cave but turns one last time to look at the two huge skeletons one more time. Something big and white draws his attention. It looks like there is something large and oval behind one of the skeletons.

Hasse walks over to the white and oval thing he caught sight of. It is located under the skeleton that has short horns. It looks like the white and oval is where the living thing must have had its anus. Hasse picks up one of the white objects and realizes almost immediately that it must be some kind of egg. The eggs are very large and have a hard and rough surface. In some ways, the rough surface is reminiscent of reptile skin.

Hasse decides to take the eggs home and he carefully places the three eggs in a plastic bag. Although the bag is large, the eggs barely fit.

Back home, Hasse looks in animal books to try to identify what was in the cave, but he finds nothing that matches what he saw there. He starts a fire in the large fireplace he has in the ""rest room"". The eggs are on the floor near the fireplace. Hasse looks at them and it looks like two of them are slowly but surely pulling themselves to the fire in the fireplace. He scratches his head but finally lifts the eggs and places them near the fire. After a short while, two of the eggs have risen and stand up in their place. Hasse doesn't know what to believe, but it's cool anyway.

After a while, Hasse goes out to the kitchen and cooks himself some food. When he has finished eating, he goes to the fireplace and puts some wood there so that the fire will not die. It has started to get dark outside the villa and when it is 10 pm, Hasse goes to bed. Just before going to bed, he puts a few more logs on the fireplace. It doesn't take long before Hasse falls asleep.

After several hours of sleep, Hasse wakes up to a crackling noise from somewhere. He quickly jumps up because he thinks there is a fire on the floor by the fireplace but when he comes out into the room where the fireplace is, it is burning peacefully as it should. He walks around the other rooms but everything is as it should be there. Hasse stands in the hall and thinks about what he heard. As he stands there, the sound is heard again. It's definitely coming from the room where the fireplace is and he goes there again.

Hasse sits down on the sofa and waits for the sound to be repeated. It won't be long before it is heard again. Hasse sees that two of the eggs have cracks in them and that a transparent, bubbly liquid flows from the cracks a little from time to time. He thinks that the two eggs have become so hot that they boil. Hasse thinks that they are so hot that he cannot remove them yet, but they will have to wait until the next day when the fire is out. More of the clear liquid spills out and there is a little sizzle in the fire closest to where it spilled out.

But as it is, there is a very large crack in one of the eggs and a large part of the shell falls off. Hasse sees something dark moving inside the egg and he quickly understands that both eggs are about to hatch. Soon he hears low animal sounds from the two eggs. Hasse gets his cell phone in the bedroom and when he gets back to the fireplace he kneels down and starts filming the eggs hatching.

The eggs move and the animal sounds are louder. More and more cracks form in the two moving eggs. They move towards each other several times while the shell cracks even more. The top of both eggs comes off and now Hasse can see more of what is hatching before his eyes. Both animals have reptilian skin but their colors are completely different from each other.

One is purple in color with a light blue mane from the head down. The light blue mane does not appear to be hard but more like fur. The other animal is grey-black with red highlights here and there. In some places it almost looks like a chessboard, but then with mixed black and red. Both animals have small horns on their heads, but the purple one has the largest horn. The animals smell in a special way that Hasse has never known before. It is both a sour lemon scent but also a warm scent reminiscent of chocolate.

Both animals kick the rest of the shells and tumble into the fireplace, but they soon fall to the floor where Hasse sits. He can now study them better. Both animals are as big as a Golden Retriever dog, although the purple one is slightly larger than the other animal. They must have been really tight in the eggs.

The one that is grey-black with red highlights has reptilian skin all over it and it has kind cute light blue eyes that look up at Hasses. He thinks it's incredibly cute. The purple-colored animal has a light blue mane of fur that runs from its head down to where its tail ends, while elsewhere it has purple reptilian skin. Hasse gently feels the mane and it is completely soft and wet and feels very nice. The animal has slightly narrower and more yellow-red eyes that look up at Hasse. Its horns on its head are very long.

Both animals have wings and Hasse carefully explores them. On the gray-black-red animal, the inside of the wings are burgundy, while the purple-colored animal has a very special pattern on the outside and inside. It looks as if a map of the Milky Way has been painted with all the stars on both the outside and the inside of the wings, and Hasse is almost hypnotized by the colors. On the outside it is mostly purple, while the inside has a more light blue color. Hasse takes a picture with his mobile phone and thinks that he should have that photo as his desktop image.

The third egg that Hasse brought home hasn't hatched and hasn't moved at all and he's thinking about what to do with it but it soon resolves itself. The purple animal runs up to the unhatched egg and eats it. A little clear liquid oozes from it but not very much. Soon the egg is eaten by the purple animal and it runs down to the floor again. The animal has leaned on the egg so that the transparent liquid has flowed out first. Hasse guesses that they cannot bear to ingest the liquid.

Both animals look up at Hasse and he guesses that they are hungry so he goes to the kitchen. The animals follow with tripping small steps. Hasse is surprised that they walk so carefully. He takes out some ham and some other small meat from the fridge and then he brings out a small plate for each of the animals and puts a small pile for each of them. Hasse sets the plates down on the floor and soon disappears piece by piece in their gap. He can see their throats undulate slightly as they swallow the meat.

Hasse thinks that he can't bear to stay up all night looking after the newly hatched animals, so he decides to go to bed, but first he closes the doors to the rooms he doesn't want them to be alone in. Hasse goes to bed and sleeps soon.

Hasse wakes up in the morning and wonders where the animals are, but it doesn't take long before he sees them. They are in the room where the fireplace is and they have grown overnight and are now almost the size of a Grand Danios.

If they keep growing this fast, I won't be able to keep them indoors, Hasse thinks. But for now they can stay. After he himself has eaten breakfast, he again feeds the two animals. After they have eaten the meat, he checks where they go and how they act.

The purple animal chases around the gray-black animal across the floor and sometimes the gray-black-red animal makes a chopping sound. It seems it doesn't like being chased. Hasse discovers that the purple animal has small balls near its butt. He wonders why but soon realizes that it must be a male. The other animal has none so he guesses it must be a female.

They continue rolling around on the floor and playing with each other for several hours. The purple one is the most active while the grey-black-red one seems to take it easy and let him do what he wants. Sometimes she hisses when she thinks he's going too far. At one point, the purple animal happens to bite her nose. Then she snorts loudly and raises her wings a little.

The play continues for a few hours but towards the afternoon it seems that the animals become less active and want to rest. The two animals lay down on the floor in the living room and they fall asleep very quickly. But the two animals do not sleep for a long time and soon they are awake again and looking at Hasse.

Hasse hears both of their stomachs grumbling and he understands that they are hungry again. There is just one small problem. He doesn't have much meat left in the fridge. But then he realizes that he previously did so-called dumpster diving in a few places with some friends. There may be free food that can be fed to the animals. Or even better. They can come along and eat what they want. Why not?

Hasse calls his friends and they decide on a place where they will meet. Hasse takes both animals to his car and drives into the city. The animals cannot be in the car but are transported with an older horse transport that Hasse has. The animals go inside and lie down on the hay-covered floor.

In the end, Hasse arrives at a small shady neighborhood in Gothenburg. The friends are already there and when Hasse lets the animals out, they become very curious.

\- What kind of animal is that? Where did you find them and when?

\- I don't know what kind of animal they are, but I found three eggs in an old cave yesterday during the day and they hatched during the night.

\- So they are fairly newly hatched, then?

\- Almost a day ago, yes.

\- They almost look like little dragons. Did they spray any fire?

\- Dragons? hmm. I haven't seen them shoot fire but the purple one is a male and he is very interested in the other one which is black and red. It's probably a female.

\- Be careful so she doesn't start laying a lot of eggs and having sex.

\- They are probably too young for that yet.

\- Ah okay. Shall we start with some dumpster diving?

\- Yep. I will let them check for food that they want.

The friends break all the locks to the cointainer that is nearby and then they open the lid and all the hatches. There are lots of different things down there. Both food and gadgets. The two animals sniff the open lid and nimbly jump into the cointainer and start looking for food.

Meanwhile, the friends are rooting for other things. It gets a bit crowded because the two animals are so big. The friends find some old paintings where the frame is cracked but otherwise looks fine. They are placed in the back seat of the car they bring with them. They also find CDs and DVD movies in a garbage bag and they put the entire garbage bag in the car.

One of the friends keeps watch in case someone comes. The animals in the containers start fighting over some food they have both found. Hasse tries to calm them down but they growl louder and louder at each other. Suddenly, the purple animal shoots out a rather long flame at the grey-black-red and it seems that she gives in and lets him take the bite. One of the friends laughs and points at them.

\- Those must definitely be dragons. Did you see the flame?

\- Yes, I saw. Okay. I hatched two dragons last night.

\- How then?

\- I placed all three eggs in the fireplace and at night they hatched.

\- So they have to have high heat to hatch?

\- It seems so

The friend who keeps watch so that no one discovers them suddenly freezes.

\- Shh. Someone is coming. Try to lure the dragons out of there.

Hasse succeeds in luring the dragons into the horse transport again and closes the hatch. He stands and waits for what the others do and say. The person keeping track seems to be getting nervous.

\- Yep. He's definitely on his way here. We drive behind the house here.

Everyone smoothly but quietly jumps into their cars and starts driving. Hasse releases the handbrake so that the car rolls away a bit before he starts the engine and the others do the same. The guard arrives just as they have already started to drive away from the scene. He manages to register some registration numbers but not all. The guard swears silently to himself.

Hasse calls the others and they think it is best if he goes home to himself and the others to himself. If the police ask any questions, he will answer that he was not with those guys that night. Once home, he lets the dragons in and they tumble around the hall and play wildly with each other. The whole floor shakes with their weight and they look like they're having a lot of fun together.

When darkness falls outside the villa, the dragons become less active and eventually lie down on the kitchen floor and rest. The purple dragon has one wing over the grey-black-red one and Hasse takes a picture of the two. They look so cute and kind. Both dragons start snoring and Hasse can't help but laugh at the sound. The snoring of the dragons makes Hasse tired and he also goes to bed.",1,1735730807.0,DragonLifestory,0,1.0,False

[‚Ç¨1500],"So lets get right into it. My wife and I are looking for an endgame espresso machine as sort of a late christmas gift for ourself to match our needs.  
We have already deccieded about a grinder to match it which would be the DF64 Gen II, choosing it was also a journey, but then I started looking into the espresso machines and to be honest I was overwhelmed by the sheer choice we have.  So here are some specs what we would like and and some information I managed to dug up myself.

  
\-We are usually brewing coffee 2-3 times a day a bit more if we have family or friends over, but thats rare  
\-We mostly drink milk based drinks so steaming is important and I do not want to spend 40-50 second steaming the milk for every drink  
\-We use light and mid roast coffee  
\-No preference with single/dual boiler or HX and by that I mean I do not mind waiting between the shot and the steam for 1 or 2 minutes and I am no fan of doing everrything at the same time, but with that in mind I do not want to wait for 15-20 minutes for the machine to heat up when I turn it on my limit on that would be around 5 min or so  
\-Having an energy save or stand-by mode would be preferred  
\-Aesthetic is an important part for us so you can recommend not perfect matches as we can compromise on some aspects if the looks win us over  
\-PID is not a must, but consistent water temp is

We are located in Hungary, but we are in no rush so taking a vacation somewhere in europe to buy the machine is not a problem, so you can recommend machines that can not be ordered or bought here.",1,1735730389.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1hr12me,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1hr12me/what_is_this_feeling/,What is this feeling ?,"*early 2017*

We‚Äôve been neighbors and working mates for about a month, and I wasn‚Äôt noticing the shift in my feelings at all.
I was well aware that it was a good friendship, but for me it was just that.
What I rather noticed was an improvement in my attitude towards work, I started to dread it much less than before, Monday stopped giving me nightmares and getting up and ready for work didn‚Äôt need my mother‚Äôs doomsday shouting every morning.

Most romantic movies depict a harmful way of seeing love, this blessing of the gods that smites you all of a sudden when you‚Äôre going about your day, unsuspecting.
It‚Äôs rarely this bond that grows on you and that you nurture gradually, by sharing things, caring for each other, small talk and deep meaningful conversations.
Sitting by his side, allowed me to understand why the team seemed to revolve around him, despite an intimidating serious face, an appetite that I never liked for cynical dark humor, and a confidence that bordered on arrogance.
What was obvious from close observation and later confirmed by his own words and life story, is that these were shields around the heart of a broken child, raised in poverty with unresolved trauma.
Shields that he would take off instantly around people he cared for.
I remember when he was mentoring interns, that when they needed him he would never sit on a chair by their side, he would get on his knees beside their desk, he would smile when explaining things to them and give them as much time and attention as needed, they loved and revered him for that. 
He‚Äôd never turn down any request for help, which made his desk a pilgrimage spot for newcomers, and would make his day fragmented with very little time for focused uninterrupted work, but it didn‚Äôt bother him, it actually bothered me more, since now as his neighbor I was overhearing all the conversations.

Now I was excited to go to work everyday, stopped snoozing, and got ready before my father. I took it as a sign of getting adapted to work and used to the team.
I was unaware of how much place he held in my day until one day he didn‚Äôt show up, his empty desk was the first thing I noticed when I got to the office, I thought he maybe went to the toilet or went to get some coffee, but when I got closer I could see that neither his computer nor his backpack were there, saying that my heart skipped a bit might be an exaggeration, but the place felt so empty.
He was never late, and in the times when he had something to do in the morning before coming to office, like training a client or a presentation, he would always tell me about it the day before, and make the same joke about not letting anyone steal his screens.
My mind started racing, I caught myself wondering if he had some sort of accident on the way, did he forget to tell me that he‚Äôll be late, how dare he ? 
It took me a few minutes and some deep breathing to remind myself that I‚Äôm not entitled to know his whereabouts, and to recognize that I was worrying ! what ? why am I worrying about this dude ? 
I sat there and started working, and I told myself that he‚Äôs just late, it happens to the best of us. A little before lunch time, I was out of self soothing techniques, I couldn‚Äôt work anymore, this absence was too much for me, but I just couldn‚Äôt simply call and ask where he was. I got up and went to his best friend‚Äôs desk, asked him if he knew if X was coming today, he said that he didn‚Äôt know, he has just assumed that he had some client appointment. 
I was getting more and more aware of the fact that i was worried, but I wasn‚Äôt questioning the feeling, it didn‚Äôt strike me as odd that all of a sudden the absence of this person was tormenting me, completely clouding my mind making me unable to focus on my work.
At some point in the afternoon, I caught my phone and sent a text, trying to make it as neutral as possible, showing the least possible amount of worry, I was naively scared that he would sense how worried I was from my message, ¬´You‚Äôre coming today or what ? Someone is gonna steal your screens if you‚Äôll be any later than this.¬†¬ª.
I had the answer in less than five minutes, ¬´¬†hey you ! I called in sick today, the boss didn‚Äôt tell you that in the team meeting ?¬†I will try to come tomorrow¬ª.
¬´¬†No he didn‚Äôt say a thing, must have slipped his mind. Get well and take care !¬†¬ª
¬´¬†I will, thank you for checking up on me !¬†¬ª
Damn that fucking boss.
I smiled at my phone, I was relieved.
The day after, when I opened the office‚Äôs door, I looked in the direction of his desk, he was there, and it made me happy, what is this feeling ? are these butterflies in my stomach ?",8,1735730321.0,Tunisia,6,0.9,False

I really liked her and it was my first time really crushing on anyone and so we started going out. She had suicidal thoughts and was in a really bad mental state when I met her and I said I was willing to help her through this healthily. What actually ended up happening was that she dumped those feelings on me without actually speaking and working through them with an adult which at the time I couldn't handle while juggling exams and family life. I was considering the possibility of breaking up with her due to my declining mental health and my inability to be the best I could for her but she said if I left her she would kill herself and if I tried to contact anyone else about this she would hate me forever. I get that I still should've but I was 16 at the time and it was my first time loving someone. After that I constantly had the thought that she would be gone one day when I woke up looming over my head so I inadvertently started isolating myself from friends and family to make sure that wouldn't happen. I started developing those issues about now in the relationship and it all went downhill. All the things I had usually been doing I had no motivation to do and I didn't plan any dates or study or anything because of that thought constantly over my head and it felt like the only person I could talk to about it was her. So with my mental health at an all time low she decided she couldn't handle it and broke it off with me. We went 2 weeks without any contact and then met up for some closure about the situation.

1hr0yxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1hr0yxn/i_18m_was_in_my_first_relationship_with_my_ex_for/,I (18M) was in my first relationship with my ex for around 2 years and we recently broke up. How to I heal the dependency issues she gave me?,I was in a relationship with this girl for two years. I really liked her and it was my first time really crushing on anyone and so we started going out. She had suicidal thoughts and was in a really bad mental state when I met her and I said I was willing to help her through this healthily. What actually ended up happening was that she dumped those feelings on me without actually speaking and working through them with an adult which at the time I couldn't handle while juggling exams and family life. I was considering the possibility of breaking up with her due to my declining mental health and my inability to be the best I could for her but she said if I left her she would kill herself and if I tried to contact anyone else about this she would hate me forever. I get that I still should've but I was 16 at the time and it was my first time loving someone. After that I constantly had the thought that she would be gone one day when I woke up looming over my head so I inadvertently started isolating myself from friends and family to make sure that wouldn't happen. I started developing those issues about now in the relationship and it all went downhill. All the things I had usually been doing I had no motivation to do and I didn't plan any dates or study or anything because of that thought constantly over my head and it felt like the only person I could talk to about it was her. So with my mental health at an all time low she decided she couldn't handle it and broke it off with me. We went 2 weeks without any contact and then met up for some closure about the situation. (I was handling it okayish) Then she kissed me at the coffee shop and it some how ended up in us wanting to try again. But i don't want to try again. She's hurt me so badly but I find it so hard to leave. Especially now that I have the comfortable option of going back to her it's extremely hard to say no after being isolated from everyone and only knowing her for the past 2 years of my life. How do I deal with this?,1,1735729863.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

How to I heal the dependency issues she gave me?,I was in a relationship with this girl for two years. I really liked her and it was my first time really crushing on anyone and so we started going out. She had suicidal thoughts and was in a really bad mental state when I met her and I said I was willing to help her through this healthily. What actually ended up happening was that she dumped those feelings on me without actually speaking and working through them with an adult which at the time I couldn't handle while juggling exams and family life. I was considering the possibility of breaking up with her due to my declining mental health and my inability to be the best I could for her but she said if I left her she would kill herself and if I tried to contact anyone else about this she would hate me forever. I get that I still should've but I was 16 at the time and it was my first time loving someone. After that I constantly had the thought that she would be gone one day when I woke up looming over my head so I inadvertently started isolating myself from friends and family to make sure that wouldn't happen. I started developing those issues about now in the relationship and it all went downhill. All the things I had usually been doing I had no motivation to do and I didn't plan any dates or study or anything because of that thought constantly over my head and it felt like the only person I could talk to about it was her. So with my mental health at an all time low she decided she couldn't handle it and broke it off with me. We went 2 weeks without any contact and then met up for some closure about the situation. (I was handling it okayish) Then she kissed me at the coffee shop and it some how ended up in us wanting to try again. But i don't want to try again. She's hurt me so badly but I find it so hard to leave. Especially now that I have the comfortable option of going back to her it's extremely hard to say no after being isolated from everyone and only knowing her for the past 2 years of my life.

i was at the self-order machine placing our order, while my dad stood a little distance away from me. out of nowhere, this random guy strikes up a conversation with my dad and tells him i‚Äôm beautiful. sweet, right? i overheard it and thought, ‚Äúokay, cool, thanks.‚Äù but then‚Ä¶ he kept talking.

WHY is the male gaze this feral? why is it more plausible for me to be THAT than for me to be a daughter?

i totally spaced out after that, but i think my dad cleared things up because i heard the guy apologising, followed by something else that my dad laughed off. i don‚Äôt think my dad knows that i overheard all that. the awkwardness was unreal though. :))

I'm mentally exhausted and just can't be bothered tbh. Then to top it all off when I thought I was having a minute of quiet my 16 month old decided to dive bomb me on the sofa while I was drinking my coffee...luckily it wasn't warm  (is a mum's coffee ever warm?!) But now my new dressing gown is covered in coffee, not really a big deal but I feel like I just can't take anymore.

I'm wracked with anxiety over my youngest, 16 months also being on the spectrum, even though he seems typical so far, I can't help but notice every little 'odd' thing he does and wonder...
He passed his one year review but my other two children also did...

Then my husband is suffering depression and is on new meds which have caused massive mood swings, one minute he's OK the next he's yelling at everyone. 
He came to bed last night and argued with me through the night about previous fights we've had and said that anytime we have a bad fight I ask him to leave and it's caused him to have 'ptsd'. He says i hardly come near him for hugs/kisses and i tried to tell him I do try but between two kids with low functioning asd and a baby I'm pretty swamped and mentally drained. My family help when they can and his family do not help at all so i feel isolated and alone. Also the last thing I want to do after he's screamed at me all day is be affectionate with him. He left work recently as he said he couldn't cope anymore which has left us financially crippled and struggling to afford rent etc. Luckily I have a great family who have lent me money. He shows no interest in ever working again and I'm not sure what will happen.

I was breastfeeding my youngest until recently and I couldn't pump much so working was out of the question for me, but now he's weaned I'm trying to find some part time work to help cover costs. Although I'll admit this has led to a bit of resentment towards my husband as I feel likes he's so hard on me yet he sits home all day just complaining about his life while I look after the kids, clean, cook etc and then he just moans at me that I'm not 'nice' enough.

I just feel like the worst wife, mother and overall person and the year is just beginning.

There could be a possibility that I am overthinking this as a result, but I have friends (both male and female) who agree with several of my observations about this woman (F 23) I went out with. 

This woman first came to my house with her family for dinner. Her mom and my dad are close friends. The following day, she asked her mom to ask her dad for my number. She said I was ""funny"" according to what her mom told my dad. My dad kept forgetting to give my number so I eventually just typed out her name on Instagram, followed her, and then dmed her asking if she got my number from her mom in which she just did. She then gave me her number and then asked me to go out for coffee sometime. I said yes and we were talking for about two hours at the coffee shop before going home. 

Now this is where things get weird. I was not aware of any of this until after we went out for coffee. Her mom and my dad were communicating about us going out (which I found annoying). According to my dad, her mom told me the woman's purpose of getting my number was to go and hang out with her and her friends which would indicate an instant friendzone to me. Specifically, she was supposed to actually invite me to be with her friends in LA. This did not happen as she invited me out to coffee first. It has been about a month and she has still not mentioned hanging out with her friends. This LA outing was actually a birthday celebration for her friend. It was 3 women total including her. It would be extremely strange to invite me to an outing like that especially when I do not know who her friends are at all. Why would I celebrate some person's birthday who I do not even know? Something seemed off to me. 

A few hours after going out for coffee, I asked her if she wanted to go out sometime next weekend but she said she was going to be in LA with her friends to celebrate their birthday next weekend and then she would be out of state for 3.5 weeks for Christmas / New Years. She said she would definitely let me know when she is free as a result. I know some people see this as the woman not being interested in you, but she was straight up going to be gone for a little over a month in total so I do not think she had an actual idea of  when she was really free. Bear in mind, she has initiated messages after the fact with me although I still initiate messages at about an 80 / 20 ratio. If she truly was not interested in going out whatsoever or talking to me again, why would she initiate any messages with me in the first place? 

The fact that she told her mom that she wanted my number to invite me to hang with her friends in LA but then told me that she was going to LA indicates to me that I am not supposed to know what she told her mom. I think she is lying to her mom and all of my friends agree with me on this. Another thing to note is that her mom was being extremely ""overbearing"" according to my dad in asking the woman questions about her intentions with me. She told her mom that the coffee outing was not a date after the fact too (she would not specify what it was supposed to be though). Now that sounds bad for me, but it seems that she was lying to her mom about the LA thing, so she could be lying about her intentions with me too. My friends think this is what is happening. My friends also suggested that the woman does not want to be transparent with her mom as it was revealed that my dad said that her mom told him that the woman does not have an ""open"" relationship with her as well (open relationship meaning transparent relationship, not the other type of open relationship lol). After the coffee outing, my dad said the mom ceased to have communication with him even though they talked regularly as they were childhood friends. They have not talked for weeks, That seems very strange too. 

Again, she has initiated messages with me after the fact (although I still initiate more) and her messages do ask questions about me and her responses are decently detailed too for the most part. We text almost every day. Her questions during the coffee outing perhaps indicated romantic interest as she was asking whether I planned to move or not and my future life plans. This whole situation does confuse me though. I do not exactly know what her intentions are and what she wants from me. Perhaps I am overthinking it. Does anybody have advice on how I should approach this situation going forward?    ",1,1735727207.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
