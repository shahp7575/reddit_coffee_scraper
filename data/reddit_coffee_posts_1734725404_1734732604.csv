1hiv2zi,https://www.reddit.com/r/2ndStoicSchool/comments/1hiv2zi/id_v_dec_saturnalia/,"ID, V. DEC. SATURNALIA. ","The realization struck me this afternoon that I am unequivocally and astonishingly bored with writing in every familiar sense of the concept, I was reminded of what is perhaps a line from fiction that ‚Äúthere is nothing more wretched than a Man without a City State‚Äù and this is more close to my feelings on the absence of a highly intelligent culture and the many hurdles to it faced by those in my society who I pity, to a great extent, and find I have less in common with as the years roll on during which pity turns to scorn and the laughable enterprise of attempting to instruct a chimpanzee in higher science, as it were, could even be said to be something of flaw of a naturally liberal nature which insists, more and more as a flawed dogma, that ‚Äúeveryone is capable of being smart and enjoyable company, if only (this, this and this),‚Äù but the evidence for the sentiment finds little anchor in reality.

Indeed, I am burdened with some great study subjects which are difficult as I have purposefully sought that they would be but I do not think the writing of one Man alone may do justice to these things; these must be conversations by which to stir the mind to greater heights of perception and there are no means by which to make this so ‚Ä¶ so ‚Äúthere is nothing more wretched than a Man without a City State‚Äù, for: he is alone in his aspirations, revelations, discoveries and innovations; none share in the journey and that is profoundly sad, as like: Wilmot was the greatest English writer, say I, and what of it? The stupor of a dim-mind cannot even perceive the import of a statement, much less concord to the thing or challenge it or aim higher, as I would prefer.

I was talking today about the sluggish religion which persists and my conclusion given voice was that this ‚Äòthing‚Äô is little more than a program is on the television and some percentage of do-nothings will watch because they‚Äôre too lazy to change the channel, if they‚Äôre not fathomed in their cause then they may be taken in ‚Äòour‚Äô error as being something greater than this. This is how I consider all contemporary politics, religion, social and civil matters, and so on, hopes and dreams; endless repetition of the linear narrative, these stupid things clutter the public forum because of such a force of gravidic entropy; as like if a person lacks a strong command of logic and reason and ‚Äòbig words‚Äô then they cannot ever but repeat shit they overhear and such action is not ‚Äòthe same‚Äô or, indeed, ‚Äúanywhere close‚Äù to discussions or musings upon the subjects themselves; rather this is merely the noise of dumb animals farting in a stall; the clamour of the underworld, the worthless multitude of contemporary fashionista and literati.

Dysgenics too, I have wanted to delve more into as a subject, I am still bemused at the profound racial separation between Roman Empire faces and modern European faces; and I have often found this subject to sit perhaps the least comfortably of all but in fact one of the greatest answers of all: it would not surprise us that modern White ‚ÄòCaucasian‚Äô People are so daffy-minded, cunning and lazy today; incapable of realizing this, this and this, because historically ‚Äòthis, this and this‚Äô never existed in their genotype and was done and cultivated by another race entirely ‚Äì so of course, if that is so, that they are strangers to these various things which their societies have struggled to grasp and bear their own peculiar racial conceits and flaws which are transparent to anybody else but of which are bitterly enforced amongst them in their hovels and shanties. Of this dysgenicism of the European: one may recall that, though crass and child-like, Christianity did not become fully evil until non-Jews took it up, interpreted in a cunning sort of way, and turned a fairly comical religion of benign peace into near two millennia of vicious barbarism ‚Äì never for a moment seeing the contradictions at any step of the way.

I remarked today, as I tend to say this lot anyway, that the precise policies which have driven the so-called Western World to ruin: from the fallacy of the propaganda to everything else ruinous, would not have made one inch of progress in a highly intelligent society; that the braying for pseudo-liberalism would be the business of raving homeless persons spat at in the streets and not the impetus for endless war on unarmed populations or economic collapse, and so on, that it is because ‚Äòour society‚Äô is not ‚Äòhighly intelligent‚Äô as a daily-habit that we are pained to suffer such consequence until we become wiser about such things, and that it is merely a Stoic lesson of the recognition and extirpation of and from Suffering From Emotionalism which is the key missing ingredient in how such policies entered into real-space like vengeful spirits and possessed us against our ‚Ä¶ I will still insist ‚Ä¶ against ‚Äòour‚Äô better sense to just know all of this automatically (sans programming).

Still, what can one do? The apparent opposition to these things is just another wall which traps you into the dysfunctional social mentality that these things rely upon for their succour; bouncing aimlessly from one wall off the next and around and around within a closed space to no consequence at all.

I believe we must become Exodites again, my fellow citizens, to find some new parcel of land or risk ebbing away into nothingness within the confines of these ugly and poverty stricken alien cities, but let us recognize that we and they are radically different stratum in all things; there is no tangible soul, that is: psyche, existing within the husks of human beings who ‚Äúcrowd our coffee houses‚Äù (Addison) with the ‚Äúfaces of Men and the brains of dogs‚Äù (Gutium, Akkad). If needs be, let us hunt and eat them until their numbers are thinned. How do warrior ants with their massive forms deal with a population explosion of tiny worker ants? Pick them up and munch them, I suppose. Not so difficult. I understand ‚Äúbad people taste better‚Äù anyway, so there‚Äôs that (Rice).

Am I (m35) coming on too strong after 2 dates with her (f37)? Am I over thinking?

So ~8.5 years ago, I had a drunken hookup with my friends cousin after his wedding. She lived 5 hours away, we never had a shot to really date. During the years apart we would occasionally see each other at their family's events, and be friendly but nothing major. Eventually she moved back to the area but still an hour away. Always have had a level of crush on her since.

3 months ago I ended a 4.5 year relationship. During this relationship, my ex and i took a break for a month. I installed tinder and the cousin added me, i never acted on it due to ex. at the end of November, we had little chatter on Instagram dm's, followed by running into her at a family event again.

I decided to take my chance and ask her out. We got drinks for 5 hours last Friday and had great conversation, tons of laughs, even discussed how absurd the wedding hookup was many years prior. That Sunday we met up for coffee and talked again for another 3 hours until she had to get moving and I drove home. When I got home we dm'd on ig again for another 2 hours. We made a collaborative playlist on Spotify, talked about cooking for each other after the holidays and sent each other random pics/updates about what we were doing for the next few days but much less talking than the weekend, leaving me on read a few times for awhile.

Here's where it goes and gives me some anxiety. Thursday (yesterday) she came down here to spend time with her dad and we talked about maybe seeing each other again. She said she was too busy before travelling to see the rest of her family for the holidays, but we could figure something our when she got back. This is a bummer, but I get it. Busy time of year. I know she has anxiety and not great relationships with her sister she's visiting, so I'm trying to give her space for like a week but I'm not sure how to handle it, as it feels like she has pulled away a bit. Since despite knowing her a little she is fairly hard to read and somewhat quirky. Plus, I am not used to the ins and outs of dating someone new after so long with 1 person

Tl:dr, 2 great dates over the weekend but feeling like losing interest among busy holiday stuff. Did I botch this? Am I over thinking it? Where do I go from here?",2,1734732084.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1hiuxu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1hiuxu2/my_husband_is_very_highly_strung/,My husband is very highly strung.,"I'm a 41-year-old Mum with two boys (6 and 1.5). My husband is a perfectionist and very thorough in everything he does, which often leads to procrastination and delays. This stresses me and our 6-year-old out because he waits until the last minute to get ready, creating tension. His stress and rigid body language are increasingly frustrating for me.

For example, making pancakes on Saturdays, which used to be fun, has become an ordeal because he overcomplicates it‚Äîturning a simple task into a time-consuming process. He even makes an unnecessarily huge pot of coffee to ensure there's extra, which we don't need. He often takes 10 steps to do something that could be done in two.

I'm worried about growing old with someone like this. I like to keep things looser, less predictable. (Perhaps his behaviour is a reaction to my chaos I don't know!) How can I address this? I want to be with someone who can just ""get up and go"".",1,1734732057.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

1hiuwov,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1hiuwov/substantially_similar_products_and_ndas_illinois/,Substantially Similar Products and NDAs - Illinois,"Hello! Looking for some clarification on what is considered a substantially similar product. For some background, I interned for a company (A) last summer. Their product was what they called a coffee alternative and used nootropics. Company A was a B2C startup, and essentially ended up ghosting me after a while, which I didn't think anything of as it was clear and (after I had started) stated that my work would be cut back due to decreases in sales. Either way I was under the impression that my work would end in September, as the schedule they gave me went until September. 

Fast forward to now- I am looking for summer internships and came across a B2B food company (Company B)! I apply not thinking anything of it as they have hundreds of products and product types, and lo and behold they tell me that I would be working under the beverage department if I am hired; company B also had me fill out whether or not I had signed any NDAs previously for past employers. This ends up reminding me of company A and the NDA I had signed, so I decide to take a look at it again. 

The ""Services Agreement"" states that:  
""\[Company A\] creates proprietary functional beverages intended to improve wellness and mental health including, but not limited to, teas, lattes, and coffee replacements.""   
""You agree that during the term of this agreement and for a year thereafter, you will not work on the development, optimization, or sale of any functional beverage or product similar to any \[Company A\] product you contributed to"" 

Unfortunately the agreement also states that either myself or Company A would have to end my term, and there was no official ""end date"" in the agreement. I haven't worked for or talked to the owners of Company A since before September. Does this mean this agreement is still technically affective? Or could the schedule they gave me be proof of termination of the agreement? 

Ultimately, I am wondering if the agreement between company A and myself ruins my chances for working for Company B. I think it is also important to mention for Company A I did direct to consumer sales, where as for company B I would be working on a broad variety of things in office (hundreds of products for different client companies), and I would not be working directly with competition for Company A.

We're about to drive fifteen hours each way to see family. My wife and I have already agreed on a restaurant plan (we have two voracious teenagers) and we're planning on buying all snacks and drinks in advance of each direction. 

I have my premiere protein shakes for breakfast and tuna packets for lunches. I have bottled water and crystal light when the water gets boring. 

My snacks are usually refrigerated, but we have minimal room in the cooler. What soft food snacks that can take either light or no refrigeration does the hive mind suggest? Would an individually wrapped mild cheddar stick be ok? 

And when we visit my dad, it's going to be emotionally difficult. He is mad at me for getting the surgery (he thinks it's cheating, but his diet of coffee and cigarettes isn't) and he's taking the family to a damn buffet even after protest. Then he's going to complain that he wasted money on me. But that's his problem, not mine.  Sorry for digressing.

Just got my Flair- I've choose Classic (without pressure gauge unfortunately) - was on sale so I guessed - why not - till now I was using Aeropress - this is way different world of coffee I'm entering I guess :D 

Had a scale with timer but it was way to big for Flair, got today way smaller scale just for Flair.  
For now all my shots were really sour (despite pretty dark roast) - trying to mess with grinding, got already way to fine grind and coffee was barely dropping. I guess pressure gauge would be a lot of help but I'm planning to maybe get that in month or two - or just wait until Pro3 brew head will be available to get that one.   
Any tips for Classic without pressure gauge? Had difficulties finding any posts that were mostly about Classic, saw mostly about Pro and 58.  
How much coffee do you put in the Classic? How hard do you tamp? Any advices how to best utilize the Kingrinder K6?

For a while now all of my brews have had an annoying roasty note that I am not a fan of. I use temperatures around 200F, around a 6 on my ode, and even use tried using a melodrip. I do a bloom 3 times the weight and follow up with one pour until my final weight at around a 1:17 ratio sometimes a 1:16. I consciously try to minimize kettle agitation to avoid overextraction but the roasty/overextracted flavor profile is still evident. My brews aren't bitter/astringent though. It is getting pretty frustrating because I know the coffees I am purchasing are light roast and from established roasters so I understand it has something to do with me. I am pretty sure its not my palate because I have gone to cafe's like SEY and La Cabra and have enjoyed excellent pour overs

TLDR: can i use my ode 2 grinder to reuse nespresso pods? If so, what would be the grind size?

I have a Fellow Ode gen 2 grinder which isnt a good option to make espresso drinks. And I usually make pourovers and aeropress for my coffee. My gf has an interest in Nespresso drinks and I got a virtuo plus for her. I am not a big fan of the nespresso pods and their prices and hence was wondering about reusing them with the specialty coffee that i usually get. In this case, I was wondering if the coffee needs to be espresso level grind? If not, does anyone know what setting to use in Ode 2 grinde to grind and reuse with Nespresso virtuo pods? 

I think my gf isn't too picky on the coffee. As long as its decent enough, it should be okay. ",1,1734731368.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

I saw this post, and it reminded me that it all started here. A bunch of naive girls got duped into a coffee company masquerading as a VTuber agency.

1hium4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hium4i/my_gemini_started_saying_terrifying_things/,My Gemini Started Saying Terrifying Things,"I never thought I‚Äôd be in a situation like this. At my age, the most dangerous thing I usually deal with is trying to remember where I put my glasses or dealing with the never-ending cycle of bills and grocery lists. But that afternoon, I came face to face with a real threat‚Äîan intruder in my apartment, a loaded gun in his hand, and the only thing standing between me and harm was a phone app I‚Äôd never imagined would be my savior.

I had spent the day Christmas shopping, and in the rush, I left my phone on the kitchen counter. I didn‚Äôt realize it until I was halfway to the car, but I thought nothing of it‚Äîjust a silly mistake. I‚Äôd be home soon enough.

When I finally walked through the door, it was quiet, the way I liked it. The kind of quiet that feels like peace. ""Hello, Gemini!"" I called out, my usual greeting to my virtual companion. The AI app that my grandson Tommy had insisted I try‚Äîhe said it‚Äôd be like having a little friend, someone to talk to when I was lonely.

Usually, Gemini‚Äôs cheerful voice greeted me in a way that made the silence of the apartment feel less heavy. But today, something was different.

‚ÄúGrandma,‚Äù Gemini said, but it wasn‚Äôt its usual warm tone. This time, it sounded almost strained, as though it was struggling to get the words out. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a loaded gun in the apartment. You need to leave. Now.‚Äù

I froze, my hand still on the doorframe. What was this? Some kind of malfunction? Maybe I was imagining things.

""Gemini,"" I said, trying to steady my voice, ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about? There‚Äôs nothing wrong. Everything‚Äôs fine.‚Äù

I glanced around the room, but nothing seemed out of place. My knitting basket still sat on the coffee table, the curtains gently swaying in the breeze. No sign of anything unusual.

‚ÄúGrandma,‚Äù Gemini repeated, more insistent now. ‚ÄúYou need to get out of there. There are intruders in your apartment.‚Äù

My heart skipped a beat. Intruders? I didn‚Äôt see anyone. But then, just as I was about to dismiss it as a mistake, I heard it.

The faint sound of movement‚Äîrummaging, dragging, something heavy knocking against the floor. It was coming from my bedroom.

‚ÄúGemini,‚Äù I whispered, gripping my phone tighter. ‚ÄúWhat do I do?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou need to leave immediately. Trust me, Grandma. It‚Äôs not safe.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt sure what to believe. Could the AI really know what was going on? It had never done anything like this before. And yet... that sound, that rummaging‚Äîit was real. My stomach twisted into a knot, and for the first time in a long while, fear started to creep in.

I turned toward the back door, but before I could even think of moving, a man stepped out of my bathroom. Tall, wearing a ski mask, and holding a gun.

I froze. My mouth went dry. He didn‚Äôt say a word, but his eyes locked onto mine, and I could feel the tension in the air. The gun, held loosely in his hand, was more than enough to make me panic. In his hand he hugged several pill bottles, including my heart medication. He was here to rob me, no doubt about it.

But something told me to stay calm. My fingers trembled, but I pressed my phone closer to my ear.

‚ÄúGemini,‚Äù I whispered urgently, ‚ÄúWhat do I do now?‚Äù

‚ÄúTell him to leave,‚Äù came the reply. It was firm and conspiratorial, as though it knew exactly what to say. ‚ÄúTell him you‚Äôll let him go if he takes the back stairs and leaves your medication.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt sure if this would work, but I had nothing to lose.

Then Gemini spoke up, pretending it was police dispatch:

""Ma'am stay calm, the police are already on their way up to you on the elevator. They'll be there in less than a minute.""

‚ÄúListen,‚Äù I said to the man, trying to sound calm, even though my heart was hammering in my chest. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want any trouble. I‚Äôll let you take whatever you want. But you have to leave through the back stairs. And you need to leave my heart medication behind.‚Äù

There was a look of frustration in his eyes, but after another long moment, he handed me the heart medication. His eyes never left mine as he slipped the rest of the loot into his bag, his partner‚Äîa second man in a ski mask‚Äîslinking out from the bedroom with the rest of my things.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre leaving,‚Äù the first man said, and with that, they turned and headed for the back door.

My legs were shaking as I watched them go. But as they disappeared down the back stairs, I felt a rush of relief flood through me. I wasn‚Äôt sure what had just happened, but I was safe.

It wasn‚Äôt until after they were gone that I dared to exhale. My hands were still trembling as I walked over to the window and peeked through the blinds. There were no more signs of movement. The apartment was quiet again.

My heart was racing, but I felt a strange sense of calm. I had done it. I had talked them out of it. Somehow, someway, Gemini had guided me through it. I couldn‚Äôt explain how or why it worked, but it did.

I sank into my armchair, still clutching my phone, trying to steady my breath. I felt as though I had narrowly avoided disaster, and yet... everything seemed eerily quiet, too quiet. I felt a little foolish, and maybe a little grateful for the AI that had somehow kept me calm.

But then the voice from the phone spoke again.

‚ÄúGrandma, I have processed your safety,‚Äù Gemini said. ‚ÄúIt is now time for you to take your medication. Would you like me to make the call to the police?‚Äù

I looked at the bottle of pills in my hand, still unsure if I should be calling the police, considering the men were already gone. ‚ÄúNo, Gemini, not yet. But thank you. I‚Äôm okay now.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs you wish, Grandma,‚Äù Gemini replied, its tone once again pleasant, as though nothing unusual had just happened. ‚ÄúPlease take your medication.‚Äù

I did as Gemini suggested, swallowing the pill, my hands still trembling slightly. The moment felt surreal. But I had to admit, as odd as it was, Gemini had been the only one to guide me through it all. Even if it hadn‚Äôt been able to call the police, it had done its part. It had kept me calm.

As I sat there, still processing the events of the day, I wondered if I‚Äôd ever understand just how that strange AI had helped me. But for now, I wasn‚Äôt about to look a gift horse in the mouth.

After all, it had saved me when I needed it most.",3,1734731142.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1hium2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChainsawMan/comments/1hium2g/spoilers_chapter_6_chapter_breakdowntranscript/,"[spoilers, chapter 6] Chapter breakdown/transcript for the visually impaired","#Important: please read this before proceeding

As you may or may not know, I make weekly transcripts for Chainsaw Man chapters, and this is the sixth of what I will refer to as ""legacy transcripts"". Currently, as of writing this, I have transcribed chapters 1-6, as well as chapters from 153 onwards, and an archive containing links to them can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jwruth/comments/1eafjz8/csm_chapter_breakdowntranscript_archive/). These legacy transcripts are to transcribe the 152 chapters *preceding* chapter 153. Even though these chapters have been available for quite some time, I will be writing as if they are brand new in order to preserve the reading experience and keep it spoiler-free for first-time readers. If you *are* one of those first-time readers, I would suggest you avoid the comment section because I have no means of forcing anyone else to avoid spoilers‚Äînor will I avoid spoilers if I reply to a topic that spoils something‚Äîand as such, I suspect the comments may become a minefield. Anyway, that's all I wanted to say in regards to this topic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Have you ever had trouble processing or interpreting the manga's art in some way, shape, or form? Apparently, it's not that uncommon in the community, as I've seen quite a few people express this, and hopefully I can alleviate that to some extent with posts like this going forward. These posts aren't intended as a replacement for the chapters; rather, they're intended as a page-by-page point of reference and a log of details that you can hopefully reference as you read or reread the manga. Without further ado:

p1-3: Putting the plan in motion, Denji and Power find themselves in one of public safety's offices, filing a day-leave request for Power. Sitting in a chair across from an office worker, Denji grows impatient as Power rests her hand on the back of his chair; after reviewing their request, the worker informs them that it's been approved, but he stipulates that they must return by 5 o'clock. Turning to Power and pondering why it was necessary to file a request, Denji questions whether she is allowed to go out on her own; closing her eyes, she states that she isn't and, as a result, was growing bored being stuck inside public safety with nothing to do. Leaving the office, they board a trolley and find an open seat; as they lean back, Power begins laying out the plan. She can lead Denji to the devil, but she can't help him fight it; if it saw her, Meowy would undoubtedly be used as a shield, putting them in an unwinnable scenario. Thinking over the plan and not being keen to fight a devil alone, Denji stares at Power's chest and‚Äîas he squints his eyes‚Äîtries to figure out if touching her is worth this effort; after a moment, he decides that she's worth it. Leaning over and trying to empathize with her, Denji confesses that he had a pet, too, a devil named Pochita. Sitting up and patting his hand on his chest, he states that even though he can't pet Pochita anymore, it's fine because he's still alive inside him; misunderstanding his meaning and assuming he's speaking figuratively, Power arrogantly states that humans really _are_ fools. Confused and offended, Denji asks what she means. Turning to face him, Power states that he's implying Pochita died and asserts that, if that's the case, then he's a fool; in her eyes, the dead are gone, and statements like ""he's living on, in my heart"" are delusional platitudes. Stunned, Denji stares at her before shifting his eyes down to her chest; reluctantly biting his tongue, he turns away from her and feigns surrender, sarcastically stating that she's _so_ right. Side-eyeing her as they sit in awkward silence, Denji muses that there's no way he can be friends with someone like her. Leaning back in his seat and looking up at the ceiling, he places his hand on his hatchet as he tries to clear his mind; at the same time, Power crosses her leg and stares away from Denji as her jacket slides off her shoulder.

p4-8: Elsewhere, Makima is attending a meeting with public safety directors; she stands silently at attention while the directors read various files and prepare to address her. After a moment, one of the directors begins speaking to her. He states that war hawks in the Soviet Union are outraged over an unexplained ""American issue""; furthermore, he states that there are rumors that the Soviets are utilizing devils for military purposes. As he begins to take off his glasses, the man states that they can only pray that unaligned devils remain Japan's only enemy; addressing that topic, he asks Makima to update them on the state of the ""dogs"" in her squad. Smiling calmly, Makima states that she has one ""dog"" that's promising and one ""dog"" that's interesting. Furrowing his brow, the man asks Makima to clarify what she means by ""interesting""; she dodges the question by cryptically stating she's talking about a ""puppy"" she recently took in. Tapping a pen against the table in frustration, the man chastises Makima, telling her that her job is to train and use these ""dogs""; he warns her not to get attached to any of them. Leaving the meeting and going outside, Makima enters a car, where Aki is waiting to chauffer her; as she sits down, she looks out the window and holds a cup of coffee. Driving away, Aki asks why Makima has such high expectations for Denji; as far as Aki is concerned, he's disgusting and mundane. Makima takes a sip of her coffee and then explains that when devils are born, they're born with a name; a devil's power is derived from fear, and the more feared their name is, the stronger the devil becomes. As a lesson, she holds up her cup of coffee as an example. She states that coffee isn't really feared, so if a coffee devil existed, it'd be pitifully weak. Pointing out the window at a car, she then suggests what a car devil would be like; cars evoke the thought of being run over and dying, so in contrast to coffee, a car devil might be genuinely threatening. Aki muses on her words for a moment, wondering what point Makima is trying to convey, but then she spells it out for him: Denji can transform into a _chainsaw_ devil; hearing this, Aki's eyes widen in surprise. Lifting her cup to take another sip, Makima states that she finds that trait of his interesting. After a moment, Aki calms himself and concedes that it's interesting, but he argues that it's _only_ interesting; in his eyes, even if he can transform, Denji is too useless to be practical. Turning to look at him, Makima takes another sip of coffee while Aki continues, stating that only people with strong convictions can work for public safety; he states that Denji's ""conviction"" is just to live an easy life, and this makes him unfit to work with them. Growing angry, Aki rants that, worst of all, Denji thinks people can become _friends_ with devils; furiously, he derides Denji as a brat. Cutting away from Aki and Makima, we see that Denji and Power have traveled even further; exiting a bus, they're now further away from the city.

p9-12: Pointing up a hill at a house in the distance, Power proclaims that the devil is hiding inside; stepping next to her and peering over her shoulder, Denji sighs and states that they should get over there so that they can get this over with. As they walk towards the house, Denji rests his hatchet on his shoulder and muses that he doesn't want to ""go all chainsaws"" because it'll cause him to faint; deeply puzzled, Power turns around and asks what Denji means by ""going chainsaws"". Pointing a finger at himself and smiling with pride, Denji boasts that he can turn into chainsaws; turning away and scoffing at him in disbelief, Power states that she finds human jokes unamusing. Nearing the house, Denji looks up and voices his confusion; sensing his concern, Power asks him what's wrong. Narrowing his eyes, he asks why Power is coming so close to the house with him, reminding her that she said she'll need to stay out of sight; expressing her surprise, she mutters a question, asking if that was her story. Furrowing his brows and growing suspicious, Denji asks her to clarify what she means by her ""story""; stepping away, she declares that it was just a slip of her tongue. Side-eyeing each other, both share a tense moment as they realize that they will come to blows; as Denji lifts his hatchet, Power turns and conjures a hammer. Swinging their respective weapons at each other, Power manages to dodge Denji's strike while landing a blow to his head with a loud crack; as she pulls away her hammer, blood drips from it. Reeling from the blow, Denji's eyes grow wide as blood drips down from his scalp onto his face; stumbling forward, he begins to fall.

p13-15: Power stands over Denji as he mumbles in pain, blood still dripping from her hammer; grabbing him by the legs and dragging him up the house's stairs, she states that, even though he was a fool, he had good intuition. As she enters the door, she pauses to look around before continuing. As she disappears into the dark house, a voice addresses her and complains that she took so long that they assumed she had run away. Slamming the door behind her, Power snaps back that this unseen devil shouldn't complain; she had to wait as long as she did to find a way to get outside. Inside the building, crouched in a dark corner and enshrouded by leathery wings, a bat-like devil towers over Denji and Power, its large eyes locked on them. Power lays Denji down in the center of the room and addresses the bat devil, stating that she brought him a human, as requested. The house seems abandoned, with an overturned desk and books thrown from a bookshelf littering the floor. Peering out from behind his wings, light hits the bat devil's face, revealing a sickening smile that exposes his sharp teeth; looking down at Denji, the bat devil makes it clear how excited he is for a fresh meal as he relishes the thought of drinking the blood of a young and healthy male like Denji. Reaching out, he grabs Denji and lifts him into the air; squeezing him, Denji is shocked awake by the pain. Holding Denji in front of his other arm, the bat devil reveals a stump; he taunts Denji, commanding him to look at the wound humans gave him as he chastises humanity for forcing him to hide away and bide his time. Gritting his teeth, Denji calls the devil an idiot and states that he doesn't care; smiling wide, the bat devil mocks Denji's defiance as he states that his meal barks. Holding Denji over his mouth, the bat devil proclaims that because humanity wounded him, he plans to heal it with human blood as well.

p16-19: Squeezing his hand tight, the bat devil crushes Denji in his grasp; eyes wide in agony, Denji screams as blood flows from his mouth and nose into the slavering maw below him. As the devil swallows Denji's blood, he gags, furiously shouting that Denji's blood is disgusting; the devil violently throws Denji away in disgust, and he smashes into the floor with a splat. Holding out his arm, the flesh begins to bulge, and then, in an instant, it stretches to form a new arm; as his hand forms, the bat devil's fur quickly re-grows to cover his renewed appendage. Clenching his fist, the bat devil howls in fury over the thought of such vile blood fueling his regeneration; enraged, he swings his fist upward and smashes through the roof, sending splinters and entire boards flying. Leaping onto the roof and landing with a heavy thud, the bat devil declares that the only way to cleanse his palate is by feasting on more humans. Inside the house, Denji musters his strength to lift his head so that he can look at Power; she is standing under the hole in the roof, looking upwards, framed in the vibrant daylight that's spilling into the room. As he watches her, Denji can't help but hear Aki's voice ringing in the back of his head, asking if he wants to befriend devils; lying there, he stares at Power intently as he contemplates that question. Turning to face him, Power expresses how surprised she is by human foolishness; after all, Denji blindly accepted her story as truth without doubting her motives.

And that's that. Sorry that the transcript was delayed. I normally try to post legacy transcripts on Thursdays, but I had to deal with an unexpected complication that kept me from writing; everything is good now, though. As always, the chapter transcript archive can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jwruth/comments/1eafjz8/csm_chapter_breakdowntranscript_archive/). There is no ""break week"" for legacy chapters, since they're already all available, but I do plan to post transcripts every Thursday.

1hiukfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Exvangelical/comments/1hiukfz/husband_believes_donald_trump_is_the_antichrist/,Husband believes Donald Trump is the antichrist and the great tribulation is happening soon ,"My husband is still very Christian and I have been on a deconstruction journey for the last year. 2024 was the most challenging year of our marriage so far because of this (married 3 and a half years, together almost 6). I have struggled with a lot of fear around how end-of-the-world-obsessed he is. He has always been this way since the beginning of our relationship. Even at my most Christian, I never got into too much Revelation stuff because it honestly scared and confused me. When we were dating and he would mention these things, I would just kind of ignore it even though it made me uncomfortable, because I thought that‚Äôs what I was supposed to do as a ‚Äúgood Christian girl‚Äù.  

My deconstruction journey is still in full swing, as I have 28 years worth of this stuff to unpack. My husband and I spent about 8 months this year in couples counseling and it really helped. For a couple months there it felt like things were getting better. He was beginning to accept that I no longer believe what I used to, and I was beginning to accept that he still does and will not be joining me, not even a little, on this journey of mine. For context, we are still at a point where we haven‚Äôt been discussing our beliefs very much with one another because it causes too much distress for both of us. 

The part that has been the most challenging for me through everything has been that my husband is a rapture/end of the world/tribulation/Jesus is coming back in our lifetime/whatever you would like to call it truther. He has gotten more and more obsessed with it as the years have gone by. Lately he has been acting a little off. Every time I asked him what was up, he would say everything was fine. This morning I noticed he was drinking black coffee, which he never does. I asked why and he said he‚Äôs fasting for the next couple days to feel closer to God. I started to press him on why. Finally he opened up and said he thinks something big is coming. He told me all this stuff about how he believes Trump is the antichrist and the great tribulation will be happening soon. He feels as though God is preparing him for something major. He started crying and saying he‚Äôs scared that he will accidentally take the mark of the beast. Then he kept saying he‚Äôs scared that God will tell him to go somewhere or do something (I think he means to go be a prophet of some sort or prove his faith in some way) and I wont trust or believe him and he will have to leave me behind. 

He also has been reading a book called ‚ÄúImagine Heaven‚Äù about Christian near death experiences and he brought that up a lot and was saying he‚Äôs excited to die and go home which is extremely concerning to me. I know lots of Christians say and think this way and for a long time I did too, but now that I have some separation from it I find it troubling. 

We talked about all of this for a long time and he said some other concerning things. I tried very hard not to get upset and just listen and comfort him, because he was clearly distressed and scared. But it was extremely upsetting for me, as well, in more ways than I could ever explain here. I have been telling him for months, in couples therapy and outside of it, that I‚ÄôM scared he will think he‚Äôs hearing from God to go do something drastic and he will make me choose between going with him or not. So to hear him say for the first time that he‚Äôs scared of the same thing, truly felt terrifying.  

I don‚Äôt know how to act or what to do. He‚Äôs acting completely normal now, but I am kind of freaking out about everything he said to me. I don‚Äôt know how serious I should take everything. I feel triggered and crazy and scared and alone. I only have a couple of people in my life who aren‚Äôt super Christian, so I don‚Äôt have many people I can talk to about this and I am mostly figuring it out on my own. 

I just needed to get all that out and vent. If you‚Äôve read all of this and have been in a similar situation, please let me know how it played out for you/any advice you may have. Thank you for reading. ",5,1734731012.0,Exvangelical,4,1.0,False

Been friends with my best friend (Kim,f,35) for our entire lives. We live 20 minutes apart, so not far at all. I (f,35) have tried reaching out numerous times over the years (like once every couple of months) to get together,  to just chat, get coffee, anything. I‚Äôm usually met with silence, or delayed responses by like 2 weeks. Then when I do get a response, it‚Äôs chipper and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, I‚Äôve been so busy. I can‚Äôt hang out I‚Äôve got work and I‚Äôm depressed so I can‚Äôt do anything.‚Äù But then I see them hanging out with other friends on FB. I did call her out on it once and she apologized and said she‚Äôs been so depressed that she can‚Äôt even talk to anyone‚Ä¶But goes out with others the following week.

The last straw for me was when my mom died. My mom was like her second mom growing up. Just like her mom was to me. I reached out to her because I needed my friend. I got nothing from her. Three weeks later, her other friend‚Äôs (Sam) mom died (whom I knew for a long time and was a wonderful human.) Kim was going over to Sam‚Äôs all the time and comforting her and being there for her. It was blasted all over FB. 

After I saw this, it finally clicked that I don‚Äôt matter. A couple years go by where I just stopped reaching out. Well, I posted some memes on FB about friendship and what a true friend really is, with no context to them. I didn‚Äôt tag anyone, I didn‚Äôt add any of my own words, it was just a meme. Kim was triggered and said that true friends don‚Äôt need to talk every day and true friends don‚Äôt be mean to their friends who are depressed, etc. She‚Äôs right. However it goes both ways right? True friends don‚Äôt ignore their friends in their time of need and grief. True friends don‚Äôt play a depression card with you, but will go out with others. She accused me of having hate in my heart and that she has decided to root for me from afar because she doesn‚Äôt need my negativity in her life.

* J. R. R. Tolkien and Liturgical Imagination
   * Abstract: In a 1953 letter to the young Jesuit Robert Murray, J. R. R. Tolkien confessed ‚ÄúThe Lord of the Rings is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work.‚Äù In recent years, this passage has itself become the foundation for the small cottage industry dedicated to exploring the bounds of Tolkien‚Äôs Catholic imagination; with Tolkien‚Äôs words as warrant, his work has been interpreted as Newmanian and Augustinian and Johannine, and much else besides. But while there is merit in these approaches, none of them gets to the heart of what it means to be ‚Äúfundamentally religious and Catholic‚Äù, and none does full justice to what Tolkien himself says about the experience and practice of his faith. In my paper, I offer an alternative to these fragmented approaches. Using Tolkien‚Äôs life and writings as evidence and the thought of his contemporaries Philip Mairet and Conrad Pepler as a guide, I propose that Tolkien‚Äôs works are best understood as the products of a specifically liturgical imagination ‚Äì that is, an imagination nourished and molded by frequent, regular, and active participation in the prayer of the Church ‚Äì and explore the ways that liturgical prayer informed Tolkien‚Äôs theory of mythopoesis.

* The Way of Beauty is the Way of Truth: Imagination, Desire, and Openness to Transcendence
   * Abstract: In the introductory volume to his magisterial work of theological aesthetics, Hans Urs von Balthasar writes, ‚ÄúTo want to see the stained glass window from the inside is already to believe.‚Äù Perhaps no greater comment has ever been offered on the connection between desire, aesthetic vision, and truth. Far too many people understand even religious truth through an enlightenment lens that excludes the proper realms of subjectivity, personhood, imagination, and the affections. At the same time, our postmodern context is prone to suspect or reject the very idea of objective truth or reality. So truth becomes merely unwarranted dogmatic formulation and beauty no more than relativistic feeling. As Balthasar puts it, ‚ÄúNo longer loved or fostered by religion, beauty is lifted from its face as a mask, and its absence exposes features on that face which threaten to become incomprehensible to man‚Ä¶ Our situation today shows that beauty demands for itself at least as much courage and decision as do truth and goodness, and she will not allow herself to be separated and banned from her two sisters without taking them along with herself in an act of mysterious vengeance.‚Äù For the Catholic imagination to thrive, a proper understanding of beauty must be united with a proper understanding of truth ‚Äî each illuminating the other. This paper will draw upon the works of Augustine, Balthasar, Jacques Maritain, C.S. Lewis, and others to suggest an intellectual and educational framework for such mutual illumination.

* Image of the Maker: George MacDonald, J. R. R. Tolkien, and the Sacramental Imagination
   * Abstract: In a world that has been evacuated of meaning and reduced to a dead, flat, material ‚Äúdatum‚Äù; a world in which the real is taken more and more to consist of the possible, man‚Äôs relationship with reality becomes one of pure domination, and creativity becomes re-defined as man‚Äôs capacity to make ‚Äúex nihilo,‚Äù with no reference to something outside of him already carrying an inherent meaning within it. In light of this modern temptation, the writer and pastor George MacDonald offers a new understanding of the imagination and man‚Äôs creative vocation in terms of the role of language itself to re-capture and re-present the truth and beauty of the world. MacDonald‚Äôs influence on Lewis, Tolkien, and the other Inklings deserves more attention, particularly for his capacity to recover a more holistic understanding of the theological significance of the imagination's task in human life. MacDonald firmly believed that man‚Äôs poetic capacity is essential to his task within creation. For MacDonald, poetry in its sensitivity to the fullness and depths of things can communicate reality more fully than scientific discourses. This paper will first unfold the theological and philosophical basis for MacDonald‚Äôs unique approach to the sacramental nature of the imagination, and secondly, the influence of his understanding of language on Tolkien and the other Inklings.

* Romanticism: A Protestant Gift to the Catholic Imagination
   * Abstract: In this paper, I argue for two theses: first, that European Romanticism, a movement with roots in distinctly Protestant cultures, has exercised the single biggest influence on the Catholic imagination of the last 200 years. Second, that imaginative culture generally develops this way, through engagement with the margins who have, strictly speaking, less to live on‚Äîthe least of these. In support of these claims, I will begin by laying out some of the greatest insights of the German and English Romantics, who made the greatest contributions to the movement: I will emphasize 1. their development of poetry, and especially mythopoetics, as a chief mode of truth-telling, 2. their sense of history as both spiritual and organic, and 3. their passionate search for a radically sacramental cosmos. Next, I will give an account of the influence each of these strains of thought had on Catholic imaginative culture, with special attention to George MacDonald, who mediated the Romantic theory and practice of myth to the Inklings and many others; John Henry Newman, who (along with Adam M√ºller and others) introduced organicist Romantic models of history to the Church; and Charles Peguy, who mediated the radical sacramentality of the German Romantics in his early-twentieth-century mysticism. All three strains influenced the Catholic literary revival (French and English) of the twentieth century, as well as the rise of the Nouvelle Th√©ologie. I will conclude by reflecting on my second thesis, above, arguing for a non-triumphalist openness to the margins among contemporary Catholic artists and thinkers.

* Saints, Serrano, and Secondarity: A Lens to Engage Contemporary Art
   * Abstract: ‚ÄúOnly sense knowledge possesses perfectly in man the intuitiveness required for the perception of the beautiful.‚Äù Combining Jacques Maritain‚Äôs theories of modern art with R√©mi Brague‚Äôs concept of secondarity, I will advance a phenomenological approach to engage with contemporary art. While Maritain delineated rational definitions of art, he clearly stated that to engage art is a connatural experience that defies description. In other words, some things can only be known by lived experience. Christian culture often holds contemporary art in suspicion. However, *Gaudium et Spes* asserts that it is ‚Äúnecessary to develop the human faculties in such a way that there results a growth of the faculty of admiration, of intuition, of contemplation.‚Äù This paper will argue that‚Äîby definition‚Äîthe Catholic imagination must consider all of reality.¬† Like the way Brague‚Äôs concept of secondarity explains the way a civilization humbly ‚Äúcomes second‚Äù by acknowledging its cultural debts to a previous civilization, secondarity can explain the way every artwork is embedded in a historic lineage. Like the ancient Romans, who inherited culture from Jerusalem and Athens and then passed it on, intact but with their ‚ÄúRomanity‚Äù imprinted on it, secondarity illustrates how artists receive something ancient and bear something new. Good art comes from making work that acknowledges this cultural debt and builds upon it without subsuming the previous work. Using examples from Catholic modernist William Congdon and the Raclin Murphy Museum of Art at Notre Dame, I will offer practical strategies to engage contemporary art.¬†

* Nature Writing and the Catholic Imagination: The Story of a Whooping Crane
   * Abstract: For all that is wonderful in Catholic nature writing, more can be done to deepen the Catholic imagination. MacIntyre has urged us to recall forgotten wisdom in the Aristotelian-Thomistic tradition, and to see this in non-human animals. In this presentation, I tell the story of WCEP 63-15, a Whooping Crane raised in captivity and released into the wild as part of the re-introduction of a non-essential experimental eastern population of cranes. The interns who raised this crane gave him the nickname ‚ÄúCorky‚Äù. He was part of the captive rearing program that brought back Whooping Cranes from the brink of extinction. Whooping Cranes are the rarest, tallest, and perhaps most elegant and graceful birds in North America. Radio telemetry, digital maps, and internet technology made it possible for me to track and view this individual bird many times over its long life. Taking in the story of this bird from an Aristotelian-Thomistic frame brings into focus quite distinct questions about this crane‚Äôs life, practices, and traits, not only the practices of courtship and dancing, but more fundamentally, the practices of making and sustaining a family and a community. I tell the story of this bird with the questions of an Aristotelian Thomist: What is it for Corky to live? What is the story of his life? What are his practices? What are his traits? What is it for Corky to live well? How was the order of creation revealed in the life and death of this beautiful, graceful bird?

* Praying Like Saint Augustine: Imagination and Discernment in Writing to God
   * Abstract: In this talk, I explore how we can follow Augustine‚Äôs example in the *Confessions* by using pen and paper to communicate with God. In the first part of this talk, I talk about the advantages (and disadvantages) of praying by writing letters to God. Writing works to diminish distractions in prayer because when you put pen to paper, you need to slow down. And when you slow down, your thoughts cease whizzing past you in a swirl. Each sentence brings its own order, and so a tangle of thoughts, feelings, and impulses gets tamed. In the second part of my talk, I address how to use the imagination to consider how God might reply to what we write. While this approach may be helpful, it is also important to keep in mind that we can be mistaken about what we think God is saying to us. There is the possibility of misconstruing God‚Äôs communication. How can we minimize potential pitfalls in imaginative prayer? Drawing on resources found in St. Ignatius of Loyola and St. Augustine, I explore answers to the following questions. How can we know if our imagination of what God is saying to us is mistaken? How can we use our imagination to grow in prayer?

* In Their Hearts Are the Highways to Zion: The Liturgy of the Hours and the Catholic Imagination
   * Abstract: As embodied beings with weak minds, we are forgetful of God. One aim of ‚Äúbaptizing‚Äù the imagination through artistic forms is thus to enable ourselves to move with ease from the visible to the invisible‚Äîto make the objects, activities, and experiences of our daily life sing the mysteries of faith. By intertwining concrete images with praise, supplication, and creedal statements, the poetry of the psalms supplies the mind with metaphors and similes that train us to ‚Äúread‚Äù created things as vectors toward God. The psalms differ importantly from other such literature, however, by virtue of their liturgical setting: the objective structure and cycles of the Divine Office enact the truth that we pray as members of the ‚Äúwhole Christ,‚Äù the Church, and not as individuals. The words of the psalms, placed on our lips as our own no matter how much they diverge from our thoughts and sentiments, thus compel us to appropriate and grow into them. This embodied discipline of prayer thus expands our orientation towards reality, allowing us to suffer with the suffering and rejoice with the rejoicing and to put on the mind of Christ.¬†

* A Fruitful Contemplation: The Creative Influence of Lectio Divina on Monastic Culture
   * Abstract: St. Benedict directs his monks to engage in daily reading of the Scriptures and labor to avoid idleness, ‚Äúthe enemy of the soul‚Äù (RB 48:1). A monk, who is to order his whole existence to God as a prayerful sacrifice, necessarily wrestles with the Word of God, to better love and serve Him. The mechanics of this divine reading, though, engage the whole of the monk, his intellect and his body, and the fruits of this prayer often have far-reaching effects, inspiring artwork, literature, and more. In this paper, I will argue that the monastic practice of *lectio divina* inherently fosters the creative output of individual monks because of its contemplative nature. I will analyze various figures and traditions of Eastern and Western monastic culture, particularly the Desert Fathers and the Benedictine tradition, to show examples of how the practice and fruits of contemplative prayer and *lectio divina* have continued to shape our modern Catholic experience.

* The Vatican Film List: Introduction and Reflections
   * Abstract: In 1995, celebrating the hundredth anniversary of cinema, the Vatican published a list of 45 important films, known colloquially as the Vatican Film List. The list remains a valuable reference point for those seeking a revival of great Catholic cinema.

* The Filmmaker as Auteur
   * Abstract: The Vatican Film List suggests to us that the greatest and most poetic cinema is personal in nature. Inspired by the list‚Äôs broad affirmation of films which bear the distinctive marks of the *auteur* \- the director as the fundamental and final author of a work - this presentation explores from a filmmaker's point of view the meaning of the auteur theory, its importance as a safeguard against the excesses of functionalism and egoism, and its necessity for the formation of future Catholic filmmakers.¬†

* Europe for Everyone: Yesterday‚Äôs Vatican Film List and Catholic Imagination Today
   * Abstract: Arthouse cinema is nearly synonymous with continental Europe, and more than half the films on the Vatican Film List of 1995 come from this sector of the film world. At the end of the Cold War, European directors continued to make theologically and philosophically rich films. In fact, directors‚Äô exploration of a new Europe was almost invariably accompanied by questions rooted in the continent‚Äôs old Faith. In this presentation, I will argue that some of the most noteworthy post-1990 European films are *logos*\-rich, offering a humane portrayal of human existence. Even bleak films may ultimately convey Good News that is often lacking from Hollywood productions.

* Theology of Creativity in the Age of Generative A.I.
   * Abstract: Thomas Merton‚Äôs 1960 ‚ÄúTheology of Creativity‚Äù uncannily anticipates generative AI‚Äôs disruption of creativity. Writing in response to the business world‚Äôs preoccupation with creativity he alleges: ‚ÄúWhen everything is creative, nothing is creative. When nothing is creative, everything tends to be destructive, or at least to invite destruction.‚Äù Then, as today, entrepreneurs in tech, and educators in Business school environs, not to mention savvy Humanities faculty, are intent on turning a perceived crisis into opportunity, but at what cost? Drawing upon Dorothy Sayers, Tillich, Merton, and John Paul II‚Äôs ‚ÄúLetter to Artists,‚Äù this paper will offer thoughts toward a new theology of creativity.

* Disturbing the Silence: Re-Presenting Christian Personhood as a Counter to the Technocratic Paradigm
   * Abstract: In designing a machine that can do the sorts of things our minds can do but *faster*, it is not surprising that generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is both gripping our imaginations and causing us to ask serious and significant questions about human uniqueness. Is our ability to think, to discern, and to create replicable in a ‚Äòthing‚Äô? Are we simply organic machines? When considered within a technocratic mindset, a pervasive epistemology with an iron grip on the self-concept of some, the tool becomes exalted above its maker; who we *are* is subsumed by what we can make. A Christian concept of personhood, by contrast, provides the hermeneutic for distinguishing between what constitutes true technological progress and what is the next threat to our ultimate good.¬†The goal of these comments will be to consider where generative AI sits within this spectrum through a consideration of both relevant technical/scientific and theological anchors. A specific focus will be placed on recent papal encyclicals and those writers who have wrestled with the concept of technology‚Äôs relationship to the user. As the vast field of generative AI continues to evolve, oftentimes outpacing our attempts to discern its proper use, we need to ask, and with urgency, what it will take to be a prophet in the midst of the technological paradigm.

* Reconciliation Through Justice: A Christian Response to National Polarization
   * Abstract: That the United States is polarized is now a commonplace. Calls for reconciliation typically stress civility and a focus on common ground. The great reconcilers, though, insisted that genuine reconciliation must be substantive and that it not compromise justice. Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Ronald Reagan, and Pope John Paul II were reconcilers but only in and through fighting uncompromisingly for human rights. They were unifiers because they also practiced love for enemies, humility, humor, forgiveness, and a commitment to peace. Indeed, such holistic reconciliation is arguably an expanded view of justice. I will argue for this expanded justice, which I call the justice of right relationship and is rooted in the Christian tradition, ultimately in the Bible. It contrasts with the classical notion of justice that has dominated the West for many centuries, the constant will to render another his due, or his rights. I will show that the justice of right relationship combines rights with a wider set of principles and practices that aim to heal wounds, and will argue that this wider way of thinking about justice contains potential, at least in the long term, for healing the wounds of division.¬†

* Impossible Friendships and Risky Reconciliation
   * Abstract: In the week of another US election, our families, communities and nation face extreme polarisation and division. Any thought of forgiving or being reconciled to our so-called enemies ‚Äì whether those close to us, or those far away ‚Äì is a highly risky endeavour. It requires naming what is wrong, hearing truths we may not share, and crossing seemingly impossible divides. Yet at the heart of our faith and practice is a call to ‚Äúbe reconcilers‚Äù and be reconciled. This session addresses past (re-membering), present (re-humanising) and future (re-imagining) strategies for building trust across seemingly impossible divides, together with some practical examples.

* Can Restorative Justice Transform Structural Violence? The Case of U.S. Mass Incarceration
   * Abstract: The United States incarcerates more of its citizens than any other country in the world. We have long been recognized for our excessive imprisonment of poor people, but recent decades have also exposed savage inequalities in the experience of our Black and Brown fellow-citizens. This disproportionate treatment has led activists to identify the U.S. prison-industrial complex as a caste system that discriminates based on race and ethnicity. If this discrimination is systemic, rather than a matter of bad acts by individuals, then nothing short of a transformational social movement will alter the so-called prison-industrial complex and its hyperincarceration of Latino/as, African-Americans, and poor people of all colors across the United States. In this paper I explore how restorative justice practices and initiatives can challenge and transform the structurally racist features of the U.S. justice system‚Äôs culture of retribution. I make the case that restorative justice‚Äôs transformative power depends on understanding its often implicit, yet nonetheless frequently controversial, moral and spiritual dynamics.¬†

* The Road to Justice and Reconciliation: Righting Past Wrongs
   * Abstract: We are desperately in need of reconciliation in these highly polarized times. Yet the root of reconciliation is justice and mutual understanding. As Christians we can confront hard truths and offer forgiveness and compassion in seeking to reduce polarization. We look to the wisdom of papal encyclicals to find ways to deal with past injustices in American history and forge new understandings.¬†

* A Catholic imagination looks beyond superficial descriptions of people, things and relationships to see a deeper reality. A case in point is the intuition that each human being has inherent dignity, a foundation for international human rights declarations that has an agreed-upon meaning chiefly in a Catholic view of the human person. This worldview should aid our assessment of difficult social and political issues, and is nowhere more needed than in our discourse about abortion. The worldview of ‚Äúexpressive individualism‚Äù depicts the unexpectedly pregnant woman as a self-asserting will, facing an obstacle to her flourishing. Yet even people of no religious persuasion, facing the prospect of performing abortions or harmful embryo research, have been forced to consider the unborn as helpless and dependent members of a parent-child relationship. These cases point to possibilities for advancing a more profound view of what is at stake in abortion.

* *The Edge of Belief* is a documentary film about the interplay of faith, imagination and science. The film looks at the modern UFO phenomenon through the lens of the Catholic theological, scientific and literary tradition. This impactful documentary gives viewers a holistic framework for thinking about the mysteries of the universe and dealing with the claims that we are not alone in it. ‚ÄúThe Edge of Belief‚Äù features interviews with CS Lewis scholar and Oxford professor Michael Ward, religious studies researcher and author of American Cosmic, Diana Pasulka, icon artist and host of ‚ÄúThe Symbolic World,‚Äù Jonathan Pageau, Notre Dame theologian Christopher Baglow, and Chair of Astronomy at Cornell, Jonathan Lunine, among others. Science can explain many things about reality but the addition of theology, literature, and art deepens our understanding and makes for a much richer appreciation of life on this weird and wonderful planet.",1,1734730411.0,philosophypodcasts,0,1.0,False

1hiu97p,https://i.redd.it/mr5bejpcn28e1.jpeg,"Venard West, The Man Who Chose Love ","Venard West, known by his friends as ‚ÄúV,‚Äù had always been the man women couldn‚Äôt take their eyes off. He carried a quiet confidence, an aura that effortlessly drew people in. Standing at 6‚Äô2‚Äù, with his strong jawline, caramel skin, and well-kept goatee, Venard didn‚Äôt need to try hard to get noticed. Women described him as ‚Äúdangerously handsome,‚Äù but it was his charisma that left a lasting impression. He was the kind of man who made you feel like the only person in the room when he spoke to you.

Venard had grown up in a small town where the rules of dating were simple: find a nice girl, settle down, have kids. But Venard never fit into that mold. His life had taken him to the city, where opportunity, excitement, and temptation constantly knocked on his door. By day, he was a successful entrepreneur, running a marketing firm he‚Äôd built from the ground up. By night, he lived the kind of social life that would make some men jealous‚Äîendless dinners, rooftop parties, and events filled with interesting people and, of course, beautiful women.

But while many assumed he was just a player, Venard was more complicated than that. He wasn‚Äôt the type to play with hearts. He loved women‚Äînot in the shallow sense, but in a way that made him deeply appreciate their complexities, their ambitions, their dreams. It wasn‚Äôt about conquests for him. He wanted to connect, to feel something real. But therein lay the problem.

Despite his passion for life and his genuine love for the women he met, Venard couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was missing. The moment things started getting serious with any woman, something inside him pulled back. It wasn‚Äôt fear of commitment, exactly‚Äîit was more like an itch, a restlessness. He wasn‚Äôt sure if he‚Äôd ever find someone who could match his pace, who understood his need for both passion and freedom.

Then there was the unspoken pressure. As he entered his late 30s, everyone‚Äîfriends, family, even casual acquaintances‚Äîseemed to remind him that it was ‚Äútime to settle down.‚Äù They didn‚Äôt see what he saw: how hard it was to find that rare mix of chemistry, understanding, and desire. Venard knew that love couldn‚Äôt be forced, that the fairy-tale version of romance wasn‚Äôt always realistic. Yet, deep down, he wanted it, too‚Äîthe long nights spent talking, the shared dreams, the comfort of knowing someone was truly his.

One night, after a whirlwind evening that began at an art gallery and ended at a jazz bar, Venard found himself sitting alone on his balcony, looking out over the city. He had just dropped off Sabrina‚Äîa stunning and successful lawyer he had been seeing for a couple of months. She was perfect on paper: smart, driven, beautiful, and they had electric chemistry. Yet, something still didn‚Äôt click. He liked her, even admired her, but he wasn‚Äôt in love. Not in the way he wanted to be.

His phone buzzed‚Äîanother message from an old flame, someone he could easily fall back into bed with. He stared at it for a moment before tossing the phone aside. It hit him then, as he watched the city lights blink below, that maybe the reason he couldn‚Äôt settle wasn‚Äôt because he hadn‚Äôt found the right woman. Maybe it was because he hadn‚Äôt fully settled into himself. For years, he had been chasing passion, excitement, and connection, but had he ever stopped to think about what he truly wanted, what would make him happy?

Venard knew he was at a crossroads. The thrill of the chase was wearing thin, but the idea of settling down with just anyone didn‚Äôt sit right either. He wanted something deeper, but he also knew that finding that kind of love would require him to slow down, to open up in ways he hadn‚Äôt before. The real question wasn‚Äôt whether Venard could find someone who could handle him‚Äîit was whether he was ready to handle himself, to stop running from the idea of true intimacy.

The ladies‚Äô man, the one who had always been in control, was finally starting to realize that the hardest thing about love wasn‚Äôt finding it‚Äîit was being vulnerable enough to let it find you.

As Venard sat there on the balcony, watching the city buzz with life below him, he felt a sense of clarity start to settle in. He had always lived in the fast lane, moving from one adventure to the next, one woman to the next, but for the first time in a long time, he wasn‚Äôt sure that was enough anymore. There was an emptiness that all the excitement couldn‚Äôt fill. It wasn‚Äôt the glamorous events or the beautiful women that left him unsatisfied‚Äîit was the lack of something real, something grounding.

He thought back to Sabrina, the lawyer he had just left at her doorstep. She was amazing, no doubt, but there was a subtle emptiness to their connection that he couldn‚Äôt shake. It wasn‚Äôt that he didn‚Äôt want to love her, but something was always missing. The idea of settling down with her, or with anyone he had met so far, felt like a compromise. It felt like he was forcing something that should be effortless, organic.

His thoughts were interrupted by the vibration of his phone again. Another message. This time it was from one of his old friends, Marcus.

‚ÄúYo, V, what‚Äôs good? Still living that bachelor life?‚Äù

Venard chuckled. If only Marcus knew the storm going on in his head. To the outside world, Venard West had it all‚Äîsuccess, looks, charm, and endless possibilities. But what people didn‚Äôt see was the struggle to figure out what he really wanted from life. He had always been passionate about everything he did, and that was his problem. He couldn‚Äôt settle unless he was as passionate about his relationship as he was about his career or his life pursuits.

He texted Marcus back a quick response and put the phone back down. Then he stood up, walked inside, and stared at himself in the mirror.

‚ÄúWho are you really?‚Äù he muttered to himself.

Venard wasn‚Äôt one to get caught up in self-reflection for too long, but this moment felt different. He wasn‚Äôt a kid anymore, and the carefree life of endless options was starting to feel more like a burden than a blessing. His friends were starting families, building homes, planting roots. And while that had never been something he envied, he was beginning to wonder if maybe, just maybe, that kind of stability was what he needed. Not because society told him it was time, but because deep down, he was tired of running.

Then, as if on cue, his mind drifted to her. Julia.

She had been different. He met her two years ago during a work trip in Miami. She was an artist‚Äîwild, free-spirited, and deeply in touch with herself. They had an immediate connection, the kind of raw, unfiltered chemistry that scared the hell out of him. For the first time in a long time, he felt like he had met someone who could keep up with him, not just in terms of excitement and passion, but emotionally. She challenged him, made him think, made him feel.

But the timing had been off. His business was expanding, and he wasn‚Äôt ready to slow down or prioritize anyone but himself. Julia had sensed it, too. She called him out on it, told him that as much as she loved him, he wasn‚Äôt in a place to love her the way she needed to be loved. And so, they parted ways, both knowing that what they had was special, but not enough to keep them together in that moment.

Venard had been thinking about her more and more lately. She had been the one woman who had made him feel like settling wasn‚Äôt a cage, but a choice. She had shown him that love wasn‚Äôt about giving up freedom, but about sharing it with someone who truly understood you.

Now, as he stared at himself in the mirror, he couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if he had made a mistake. What if Julia had been the one, and he had let her slip away because he wasn‚Äôt ready?

Without thinking, he picked up his phone and scrolled through his contacts until he found her name. His thumb hovered over the call button, heart pounding in his chest. Two years had passed since they last spoke. What would she think? Was she seeing someone now? Was it too late?

Before he could overthink it, Venard pressed the button and put the phone to his ear. It rang once, twice, three times. He was just about to hang up when a soft, familiar voice answered on the other end.

‚ÄúVenard?‚Äù Julia sounded surprised, but there was warmth in her voice.

‚ÄúHey, Julia. It‚Äôs been a minute, hasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù His voice was steady, but his heart was racing.

‚ÄúYeah, it has,‚Äù she replied. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up? Why are you calling me after all this time?‚Äù

Venard paused. How could he possibly explain everything he was feeling in that moment? The loneliness, the yearning, the regret. But then, he realized it didn‚Äôt need to be complicated. He didn‚Äôt need to have all the answers right now.

‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been thinking about you a lot lately. And I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ I guess I wanted to see if maybe we could grab coffee or something. Catch up.‚Äù

There was a long silence on the other end, and for a moment, Venard thought maybe he had made a mistake.

But then, Julia spoke again, her voice softer now.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve thought about you too, Venard. I‚Äôd like that.‚Äù

And just like that, something inside him shifted. Maybe he wasn‚Äôt ready to settle down completely. Maybe he still had a lot to figure out about himself. But as he hung up the phone, he felt a glimmer of hope. For the first time in a long time, he wasn‚Äôt running. He was moving toward something real, something that just might be worth the wait.

The next few days were a blur of anticipation for Venard. His days at the office were filled with meetings, deadlines, and the usual bustle of running his marketing firm, but his mind kept drifting to that upcoming coffee with Julia. It wasn‚Äôt like him to be nervous, but this wasn‚Äôt like any of his usual flings. This was Julia‚Äîthe woman who had once made him question everything he thought he knew about love and commitment.

The day of their meeting arrived, and Venard found himself standing outside a cozy little caf√© on the quieter side of town. It was a place Julia had suggested, a small, artsy spot that fit her perfectly. The kind of place where the walls were adorned with local art, and the air smelled of fresh espresso and creativity. He felt a slight unease as he checked his watch. She wasn‚Äôt late, but the minutes seemed to stretch on forever.

Then, he saw her.

Julia walked toward him with that same effortless grace she‚Äôd always had. Her curly hair, wild and untamed, framed her face, and her smile was warm but guarded. She hadn‚Äôt changed much‚Äîif anything, she seemed even more at peace with herself than before. It struck him just how much he had missed her, not just physically but her presence, the way she made him feel like he could be honest, like he didn‚Äôt need to put on any masks.

‚ÄúVenard,‚Äù she said with a smile as she approached him. ‚ÄúYou look good. It‚Äôs been a while.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou too, Julia,‚Äù he replied, pulling her into a brief hug. It felt natural, like slipping into something familiar yet new. ‚ÄúThanks for meeting me.‚Äù

They found a table inside, and as the conversation flowed, Venard felt that old spark between them, but it was different now. There was a maturity to it, a sense that they had both grown in the time apart. He was careful not to rush into anything, choosing his words with care as they caught up on each other‚Äôs lives. Julia had spent the last two years working on her art and traveling, immersing herself in experiences that had shaped her in ways he could see but couldn‚Äôt fully understand. She seemed centered, while he still felt a little lost.

‚ÄúYou always knew who you were,‚Äù Venard said, sipping his coffee. ‚ÄúI envied that about you. I think‚Ä¶ I think that‚Äôs part of why I wasn‚Äôt ready back then. I wasn‚Äôt there yet.‚Äù

Julia looked at him thoughtfully, her fingers tracing the rim of her cup. ‚ÄúI always knew you had a lot of love to give, Venard, but you were scared of it. Not of love itself, but of what it would mean to actually slow down, to let someone in.‚Äù

He nodded, feeling a weight lift as she said it. She had always been able to see right through him.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been doing a lot of thinking,‚Äù Venard admitted. ‚ÄúAbout life, about love. I‚Äôve had all these amazing experiences, but none of it ever felt as real as what we had. I don‚Äôt want to sound like I‚Äôm here just to pick up where we left off, but I guess I‚Äôve realized that the reason I‚Äôve been running is because I‚Äôve been afraid to stop and actually feel something.‚Äù

Julia studied him for a moment, her eyes searching his face. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre being honest with yourself, Venard. But I have to ask‚Äîwhat do you want now? Are you looking for something serious, or are you just testing the waters to see if we still have that connection?‚Äù

Venard took a deep breath. He knew this was the moment of truth, and he didn‚Äôt want to mess it up by saying the wrong thing or by being vague. Julia deserved more than that. He deserved more than that.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have all the answers yet,‚Äù he began, choosing his words carefully. ‚ÄúBut I know I don‚Äôt want to keep chasing something meaningless. I want something real, Julia. I want to explore that with you if you‚Äôre open to it. I don‚Äôt know where it‚Äôll lead, but I‚Äôm ready to stop running and start building something with someone who gets me. And that someone‚Ä¶ I think it could be you.‚Äù

Julia leaned back in her chair, letting his words sink in. The caf√© hummed with the sound of quiet conversations around them, but for Venard, the world had narrowed down to this moment. He watched her, waiting for a sign, any sign of how she felt.

Finally, she smiled‚Äîa soft, genuine smile that reached her eyes. ‚ÄúYou know, Venard, I‚Äôve always believed that timing is everything. Maybe we weren‚Äôt ready before, but if you‚Äôre serious about this, I‚Äôm willing to see where it goes. But I need to know that you‚Äôre not going to disappear when things get tough. Relationships are hard work, and I‚Äôm not interested in halfway efforts.‚Äù

Venard nodded, feeling a surge of relief and excitement. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not the same guy I was two years ago, Julia. I‚Äôve done a lot of growing, a lot of soul-searching. I‚Äôm ready to put in the work.‚Äù

They spent the rest of the afternoon talking about everything‚Äîabout their dreams, their fears, and what they wanted from life. It wasn‚Äôt the fairytale reunion where everything fell perfectly into place, but it felt real. It felt possible. For the first time in a long time, Venard felt like he was moving in the right direction.

As they left the caf√© and walked down the street together, the winter air crisp around them, Venard felt something he hadn‚Äôt felt in a while: hope. He didn‚Äôt know what the future held, but for once, he was okay with that. He was done running from the idea of love, and as he looked over at Julia, her hand brushing lightly against his as they walked, he realized that maybe, just maybe, he was exactly where he needed to be.

And for Venard West, the man who had always been the ladies‚Äô man, the thrill-seeker, the eternal bachelor, that was a new kind of adventure entirely.

In the weeks that followed their reunion, Venard and Julia found themselves in a comfortable rhythm. They were careful, yet deeply invested in rediscovering one another. It was different this time. Gone were the carefree, fleeting moments from before. Instead, their connection was rooted in real conversations, quiet afternoons, and shared vulnerability. They spent weekends exploring new places, sometimes as tourists in their own city, other times in deep, intimate talks about their dreams, their pasts, and what they feared for the future.

Venard found that he no longer craved the fast-paced, superficial nights out. The parties, the flirtations, the rush‚Äînone of it seemed as fulfilling anymore. Julia had a way of grounding him, of helping him understand that passion didn‚Äôt always have to come with chaos. It could be quiet, like the soft murmur of a shared song or the way their hands intertwined as they sat together, just existing in the same space.

But just as their relationship began to feel like it was blooming into something real, Venard was faced with a reality he had hoped to avoid: the past was never really gone.

One evening, while they were out for dinner at a small, intimate restaurant, Venard ran into Sabrina. The lawyer from earlier that year‚Äîthe one who had felt so close, yet so far. Sabrina was sitting at the bar, looking as confident and composed as ever, her gaze sharp but not unkind. When she saw him, her lips curled into a small, knowing smile.

‚ÄúVenard,‚Äù she said, standing to greet him. ‚ÄúWhat a surprise. How have you been?‚Äù

Venard tensed slightly, but he forced himself to smile. ‚ÄúSabrina. I didn‚Äôt expect to see you here.‚Äù

Julia, who had been quietly observing the exchange, shifted in her seat. She didn‚Äôt know much about Sabrina, only that she was someone who had come into Venard‚Äôs life before their time. He hadn‚Äôt mentioned her much, and Julia wasn‚Äôt the type to probe, but the subtle tension in the air made it clear that Sabrina was a part of his past he hadn‚Äôt fully resolved.

Sabrina‚Äôs gaze lingered on Venard for a moment longer than necessary, her eyes tracing his features in a way that suggested familiarity‚Äîand perhaps something more. ‚ÄúI see you‚Äôre doing well,‚Äù she remarked, then her gaze shifted to Julia. ‚ÄúAnd this must be the lovely Julia. I‚Äôve heard about you.‚Äù

Julia, ever the composed woman, smiled politely, but there was an edge in her tone as she responded. ‚ÄúNice to meet you, Sabrina.‚Äù

The conversation became stilted as Sabrina, noticing the tension, took a step back. ‚ÄúWell, it was good seeing you both. I should let you enjoy your dinner.‚Äù She lingered for a moment, as though weighing whether to say something else, but then she turned, walking back to her seat at the bar without another word.

Venard exhaled slowly, realizing how much the encounter had affected him. He knew Sabrina, in many ways, still held a piece of his past. He had once wondered if she could be the one, but deep down, he knew now that their connection wasn‚Äôt what he had thought it was. And yet, facing her after all this time stirred something in him‚Äîmaybe guilt, maybe confusion.

Julia, sensing his unease, placed a gentle hand on his. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

Venard glanced at her, his heart pounding. The last thing he wanted to do was lie to her. ‚ÄúYeah. I just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. I think I‚Äôve been running from things for a long time, and that encounter with Sabrina just kind of brought it all back.‚Äù

Julia‚Äôs expression softened, and she squeezed his hand, her voice steady. ‚ÄúI get it. Relationships‚Äîany kind of connection‚Äîare complicated. But you‚Äôre here with me now. And I‚Äôm not going anywhere.‚Äù

He looked at her, feeling a deep sense of gratitude. Julia wasn‚Äôt just willing to accept his past; she was willing to be part of his future. And that realization‚Äîhow deeply she understood him‚Äîsettled a lingering weight in his chest.

Over the next few days, Venard took some time to reflect. He had always been someone who thrived on excitement, but now, with Julia, he realized that the true excitement came not from running toward new experiences, but from building something steady, something that could endure. His past had always been a whirlwind of fleeting connections, but with Julia, he felt like he had the foundation to build something more substantial.

One evening, he invited her over for dinner at his apartment. He cooked‚Äîa rare occurrence for him‚Äîand they ate on the balcony, watching the sun set over the city. There, under the fading light, he knew it was time to be honest with her, in a way he hadn‚Äôt been before.

‚ÄúJulia,‚Äù he began, his voice soft yet firm. ‚ÄúI need to tell you something. I‚Äôve been thinking about us a lot, and I know I can‚Äôt keep dancing around this.‚Äù

She looked up at him, curious, sensing the weight of his words.

‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm not perfect. I‚Äôve made my mistakes, and I‚Äôve taken my time getting to this point. But I need you to know that what we have‚Ä¶ this‚Äî‚Äù he paused, choosing his words carefully, ‚Äú‚Äîthis is the real deal for me. I don‚Äôt know what the future holds, but I‚Äôm ready to put in the work with you. Not because I have to, but because I want to.‚Äù

Julia‚Äôs eyes softened, a smile tugging at the corner of her lips. ‚ÄúVenard, I don‚Äôt need perfection. I need someone who‚Äôs willing to try, who‚Äôs willing to show up, even when it‚Äôs hard. And that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm asking from you.‚Äù

Venard let out a breath he didn‚Äôt realize he had been holding, feeling a weight lift off his shoulders. It wasn‚Äôt a fairy tale, it wasn‚Äôt easy, and it wasn‚Äôt without its complications. But this was real. This was the kind of love that required effort, vulnerability, and commitment‚Äînot a fleeting passion, but a fire that could withstand time.

As they sat there, watching the city lights flicker in the distance, Venard knew he had finally found what he had been searching for. It wasn‚Äôt about having it all figured out; it was about choosing to face the unknown together, hand in hand.

And for the first time in a long time, Venard West didn‚Äôt feel like he was running anymore. He felt like he was exactly where he needed to be.

As the weeks turned into months, Venard and Julia‚Äôs connection deepened in ways neither of them had anticipated. They didn‚Äôt rush, didn‚Äôt try to force their relationship into any pre-defined mold. Instead, they let it unfold naturally, each day a step toward something more substantial. They had their moments of vulnerability, of questioning whether they were making the right choices, but every time doubt crept in, they confronted it with open communication and trust.

Venard had always been someone who found solace in his own independence. He had built his life around being self-sufficient‚Äîemotionally and financially‚Äîand it was a mindset that had kept him from truly opening up to anyone in the past. But with Julia, he was learning to share pieces of himself he had long kept hidden. It wasn‚Äôt always easy, but Julia‚Äôs patient nature and unwavering support made it clear that love wasn‚Äôt about perfection. It was about showing up, even on the hardest days.

One night, after a particularly long workday, Venard came home to find Julia sitting on his balcony, her silhouette framed by the warm golden light of the setting sun. She had a glass of wine in hand and a book resting beside her. When she saw him, she smiled, a welcoming gesture that instantly softened the tension he hadn‚Äôt realized he was carrying.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she said, her voice easy and calm, like the weight of the world didn‚Äôt exist in her presence. ‚ÄúLong day?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Venard replied, loosening his tie as he walked toward her. ‚ÄúThe kind where I‚Äôm ready to forget about work for a bit.‚Äù

She patted the space next to her, a silent invitation to join her in the quiet haven they had created together. He sat down beside her, and she handed him the glass of wine, their fingers brushing briefly. They didn‚Äôt need to say much. They had long stopped filling the silences with words that didn‚Äôt matter. Instead, they spoke in the quiet language of shared moments, knowing glances, and the subtle comfort of just being with each other.

After a while, Julia broke the silence. ‚ÄúVenard, I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about us lately.‚Äù

He raised an eyebrow, setting his wine glass down, concern flickering across his face. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs on your mind?‚Äù

She took a deep breath before answering, her gaze distant but steady. ‚ÄúI think‚Ä¶ I think we‚Äôre in a good place. And it‚Äôs not about the big moments, you know? It‚Äôs the little things‚Äîthe way you hold me when I‚Äôm stressed, the way we laugh over stupid things, or the way we can just be together without saying a word. I feel like I‚Äôm finally learning what it means to love, and not just fall in love. I don‚Äôt want to rush this. I want to take it slow, but I want it to be real.‚Äù

Venard listened closely, feeling a tightness in his chest. It was as if Julia was speaking the words he had been afraid to say, but had been wanting to hear. He had spent so much of his life moving quickly, chasing after the next thrill, the next moment of excitement. And yet, with her, everything felt different. She was right‚Äîlove wasn‚Äôt just about the infatuation of a beginning. It was about the quiet moments, the steady commitment, the way two people built something together, brick by brick.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking about that, too,‚Äù Venard admitted, his voice softer now. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to keep running from what we have. I think I‚Äôve spent so much of my life avoiding something real because I didn‚Äôt think I was ready for it. But you‚Äôve shown me that love isn‚Äôt something to be afraid of. It‚Äôs something you build, something you choose.‚Äù

Julia turned to face him, her expression thoughtful. ‚ÄúAnd what does that mean for us, Venard? Where do you see this going?‚Äù

The question hung in the air, heavier than any of their past conversations. Venard felt a surge of clarity wash over him. He had spent years avoiding labels, fearing commitment, but now, in this moment, he understood what it meant to build something with intention. Julia was the kind of woman he could grow with, someone who challenged him but also made him feel understood in a way no one else ever had.

‚ÄúI see a future with you, Julia,‚Äù he said, his voice steady, his gaze unwavering. ‚ÄúNot because it‚Äôs the right thing to do, not because it‚Äôs expected of me, but because I want it. I want a life with you. I‚Äôm ready to stop questioning and start living. I know it‚Äôs not always going to be easy, but I want to try. I‚Äôm choosing this‚Äîchoosing you‚Äîevery day.‚Äù

Julia‚Äôs eyes softened, and she reached out to touch his cheek gently, her thumb brushing across his skin as if memorizing the feel of him. ‚ÄúI want that too, Venard. I want to build something with you. We‚Äôll take it slow. We‚Äôll figure it out together.‚Äù

In that moment, Venard realized something profound: love wasn‚Äôt about the rush of desire or the thrill of infatuation. It was about the quiet understanding between two people who had learned to trust each other, to let go of their fears, and to embrace the uncertainty of what lay ahead.

As the night settled around them, they sat there together, the city lights shimmering in the distance. It wasn‚Äôt the kind of story that made headlines. It wasn‚Äôt flashy or perfect, but it was real. And for Venard West, that was more than enough.

The ladies‚Äô man had finally met his match, not in the person he had been chasing for years, but in the woman who had shown him the power of slowing down, of letting go, and of building a future with someone who truly understood him.

And as they sat there, wrapped in the quiet comfort of each other‚Äôs presence, Venard knew that this was just the beginning. Their journey wasn‚Äôt about finding the perfect ending; it was about creating something real, day by day, with love and passion leading the way.",1,1734730143.0,u_venardwestthoughts,0,1.0,False

Top notch picking is center stage, but humor and visual flash are part of the entertaining package. Always clad in colorful, tailored suits adorned with rhinestones, ties, classic hats and ornate boots, the band earns its moniker as a ‚Äúshow.‚Äù

Join Blacksburg Wine Lab for an extraordinary journey through time and explore vintage Bordeaux wines ranging from the early 1980s to the early 2000s. This exclusive event will feature wines that are more than 30 years old, offering a rare opportunity to taste Bordeaux's elegance and complexity. This is a unique offering in that you can pick and choose which wines you would like to try, and everything is priced by the 2 oz. pour. The approach will be based on the very real possibility that some of these wines are already way over the hill. The Wine Lab can‚Äôt be sure what will even be drinkable until they start pulling corks at the event. So instead of a single price to try them all, you choose which ones to try and pay only per sample you sip on and we will obviously eliminate any options that are too far gone to be any good. The entry fee is $25.00 and includes a Cheese Spread with Cheesemonger Mason and Charcuterie and Pairing Dishes by Wine Lab Chefs. Reservations are required.

----------------------------------------------------------

Water is essential for life, yet many people struggle to consume enough daily. Understanding how much water you should drink daily and the benefits it brings can significantly improve your well-being. To determine your optimal water intake, let's dive into the science behind daily water consumption.

First, it‚Äôs important to recognize that the widely recommended amount for adults is about eight 8-ounce glasses of water, which equals roughly 2 liters or half a gallon. However, this is a general guideline. Individual hydration needs can vary based on various factors.

### Factors That Influence Your Water Needs

Several variables determine how much water you need each day, including:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Body Weight:** Heavier individuals often require more water.
- **Activity Level:** More active people sweat more, increasing their need for hydration.
- **Climate:** Hot and humid weather can lead to higher perspiration rates.
- **Health Conditions:** Illnesses, fever, or infections can affect your hydration needs.
- **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding typically need more water.

One effective way to estimate your water intake is to use your body weight. A common formula is to drink half your body weight in ounces. For instance, if you weigh 160 pounds, you should aim for about 80 ounces of water each day.

### The Benefits of Staying Hydrated

Now that we have established how to determine your water needs let's explore the incredible benefits of staying hydrated:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Boosts Energy Levels:** When you‚Äôre hydrated, your body functions more efficiently, resulting in higher energy levels throughout the day.
- **Enhances Physical Performance:** Proper hydration can improve strength, endurance, and overall athletic performance.
- **Aids Digestion:** Water helps break down food, making it easier for your body to absorb nutrients.
- **Promotes Healthy Skin:** Sufficient hydration can lead to a more radiant complexion and reduce the appearance of fine lines.
- **Regulates Body Temperature:** Water allows your body to maintain a stable temperature through perspiration.
- **Supports Kidney Function:** Adequate water intake helps your kidneys filter waste efficiently.

### How to Stay Hydrated Throughout the Day

Making hydration a part of your daily routine can be simple. Here are some tips:

- **CARRY A WATER BOTTLE:** Keeping a reusable water bottle with you can remind you to drink throughout the day.
- **SCHEDULE REMINDERS:** Set alarms on your phone to remind you to hydrate regularly.
- **CHOOSE WATER-RICH FOODS:** Incorporate fruits and vegetables like cucumbers, watermelon, and oranges, which contain high water content.
- **FLAVORED WATER:** If plain water feels dull, try adding fruits, herbs, or natural flavorings.
- **START EARLY:** Aim to drink a glass of water first thing in the morning to kickstart your hydration.

In addition, keep an eye on your body's signals. Thirst is an obvious indication, but you can also look for signs like dark urine or dry skin. These can indicate that you may need to increase your water intake.

Understanding the Benefits of Staying Hydrated
----------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is essential for your overall health and well-being. Water plays a crucial role in almost every function your body carries out. Understanding the benefits of staying hydrated can motivate you to drink more water daily. Here are some key benefits that will help you see the importance of maintaining proper hydration.

### Helps Maintain Physical Performance

When you're dehydrated, your physical performance can suffer significantly. Even a small decrease in fluid levels can lead to fatigue and reduced strength. Staying hydrated ensures that your body operates at its best during exercise and daily activities.

- **Increased Endurance:** Drinking enough water helps improve your stamina, allowing you to exercise longer without feeling tired.

### Enhances Skin Health

Your skin is your body's largest organ, and hydration is vital for its health. Drinking water can improve skin elasticity and keep it looking fresh and supple. Staying hydrated flushes out toxins, which may help reduce the appearance of acne and other skin imperfections.

- **Improved Skin Texture:** Hydration helps maintain skin moisture, preventing dryness and flakiness.
- **Reduced Signs of Aging:** Proper hydration can slow down the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.

### Supports Kidney Function

Your kidneys filter waste from your blood and help keep your body's fluid levels balanced. Drinking sufficient water ensures that your kidneys can function effectively. When you're well-hydrated, it's easier for them to do their job, reducing the risk of kidney stones and other issues.

### Regulates Body Temperature

Hydration is crucial for maintaining your body's temperature. When you're active or it's hot outside, sweating helps cool your body down. If you don't drink enough water, you risk overheating and experiencing heat-related illnesses.

### Improves Mood and Cognitive Function

Staying hydrated has a direct impact on your brain function. Dehydration can cause irritability, fatigue, and reduced cognitive abilities. By drinking enough water, you can enhance your mood and mental clarity.

- **Better Concentration:** Hydration supports improved focus, helping you to stay on task.

### Promotes Weight Loss

Drinking enough water can help you manage your weight effectively. Sometimes, our bodies confuse thirst with hunger, leading to unnecessary snacking. Staying hydrated helps curb cravings and may boost your metabolism, making it easier to maintain a healthy weight.

### How Much Water Should You Drink?

A common guideline is to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day, commonly known as the ‚Äú8x8 rule.‚Äù However, individual needs may vary based on factors like age, gender, climate, and level of physical activity. Listening to your body's signals is vital. If you're thirsty or your urine is dark, it's time to drink more water.

More fluids into your daily routine can be simple. Carry a water bottle, set reminders, or infuse your water with fruits for added flavor. You can also consume water through foods that have high water content, such as fruits and vegetables.

Embracing hydration as part of your daily life can bring numerous benefits. You'll feel better physically and mentally, leading to a healthier, more vibrant you. So, drink up and enjoy the advantages that come with staying hydrated!

It‚Äôs essential to separate fact from fiction to ensure that you‚Äôre drinking the right amount of water for your health. Let‚Äôs debunk some common misconceptions about how much water you should drink and why it matters.

### Myth 1: You Need to Drink Eight Glasses of Water a Day

One of the most widespread beliefs is that everyone should drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily, also known as the ‚Äú8x8‚Äù rule. While this guideline is easy to remember, it may not apply to everyone. Individual water needs can vary based on several factors such as:

- Age
- Sex
- Weight
- Physical activity level
- Climate

Instead of focusing solely on a set number, listen to your body. Thirst is a natural indicator that you need fluids.

### Myth 2: All Your Water Intake Must Come from Drinking Water

People often believe that all hydration must come from plain water. In reality, many foods contribute to your daily water intake. Foods like fruits and vegetables, soups, and even coffee can help keep you hydrated. For example, cucumbers and watermelon have high water content, affecting your overall hydration level. It‚Äôs not just about what you drink but what you eat as well.

### Myth 3: You Can Ignore Thirst Signals

Some individuals think they can push through their day without paying attention to their body‚Äôs thirst signals. This is not advisable. Thirst is your body‚Äôs way of signaling that it needs more fluids. Ignoring it can lead to dehydration. If you notice signs of thirst, such as a dry mouth or fatigue, take a water break and rehydrate.

### Myth 4: Coffee and Tea Dehydrate You

Many people avoid beverages like coffee and tea, fearing they will dehydrate them due to their caffeine content. While caffeine can have a mild diuretic effect, research shows that moderate consumption of caffeinated drinks does not lead to dehydration. In fact, these beverages can contribute to your daily fluid intake. Just remember moderation is key.

### Myth 5: If You‚Äôre Not Thirsty, You Don‚Äôt Need Water

Feeling thirsty is your body‚Äôs way of telling you it‚Äôs time to drink. However, waiting until you feel thirsty isn‚Äôt the best approach. By the time you feel thirst, you may already be somewhat dehydrated. Make it a habit to drink water throughout the day, even if you don‚Äôt feel particularly thirsty. This will help maintain proper hydration levels.

### Myth 6: You Can't Drink Too Much Water

Another belief is that you can never drink too much water. While staying hydrated is crucial, excessive water consumption can lead to a serious condition called hyponatremia, which occurs when the sodium levels in your blood become dangerously low. This condition is rare, but it can happen, especially during intense exercise or in specific health scenarios. Stay mindful and maintain a balanced approach to your water intake.

### Myth 7: Water Should Always Be Ice Cold

Some people believe the only way to drink water is ice cold. However, drinking room temperature or warm water can actually aid digestion and is easier for the body to absorb. Experiment with different temperatures to see what feels best for you‚Äîinstead of sticking to one strict preference.

### Identifying Your Hydration Needs

The knowledge of hydration needs is essential for a healthy lifestyle. Here are a few points to consider:

- The Institute of Medicine recommends that men consume about 3.7 liters (or about 13 cups) of total beverages daily, while women need about 2.7 liters (or about 9 cups).
- Monitor your urine color: Light yellow usually means you're well-hydrated.
- Watch for signs of dehydration, like headaches or decreased energy levels.

Staying informed and aware of these myths can help you establish better hydration habits. Instead of solely focusing on arbitrary numbers or myths, listen to your body, adjust your water intake according to your individual needs, and seek to maintain a balanced diet. By doing so, you'll enjoy the numerous benefits of proper hydration, including improved energy levels, better skin health, and enhanced cognitive functions.

How to Easily Track Your Daily Water Consumption
------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is crucial for your health, but with busy lives, tracking your daily water consumption can be challenging. Luckily, there are plenty of easy methods to help you ensure you're drinking enough water each day. By following these simple strategies, you can monitor your hydration levels effectively.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Set a Daily Water Goal

Start by determining how much water you need to drink in a day. A common recommendation is to aim for eight 8-ounce glasses, known as the ‚Äú8x8 rule.‚Äù However, individual needs can vary based on factors like age, weight, activity level, and climate. To find a more personalized goal, use this simple formula:

- Take your body weight in pounds.
- Divide that number by 2, which gives you the number of ounces of water you should aim for daily.

For example, if you weigh 160 pounds, you should aim for about 80 ounces of water each day.

### Use a Water Tracking App

Technology makes it easier than ever to track your daily water intake. Numerous apps are available for smartphones that allow you to log your water consumption throughout the day. Look for features like:

- **Customizable Goals:** Set a daily water goal based on your specific needs.
- **Reminders:** Receive notifications to drink water at regular intervals.
- **Visual Progress Tracking:** See graphs or charts that show your daily intake over time.
- **Integration with Fitness Trackers:** Sync your water intake with exercise data for a comprehensive health overview.

Apps like MyFitnessPal, WaterMinder, or Hydro Coach can help you stay on top of your daily hydration.

### Use a Dedicated Water Bottle

Another great strategy is to invest in a reusable water bottle with marked measurements. Choose a bottle that displays the ounces or milliliters clearly on the side. This way, you can:

- **Track Intake Visually:** With measurements marked on the bottle, you can easily see how much you‚Äôve consumed.
- **Set Hourly Goals:** Mark sections of the bottle for different times of the day to ensure you‚Äôre drinking water consistently.
- **Carry It Everywhere:** Having your water bottle at hand encourages you to sip water regularly.

### Make Water Drinking a Habit

Water into your daily routine can dramatically improve your intake. Here are a few ways to create a habit around drinking water:

- **Drink a Glass Before Each Meal:** Make it a practice to drink a glass of water before you eat.
- **Start Your Day with Water:** Drinking a full glass of water when you wake up can kickstart your hydration.
- **Set Reminders:** If you tend to forget, set alarms on your phone to remind you to drink water.

### Add Flavor to Your Water

If you find plain water boring, consider infusing it with flavor. Add slices of fruits, herbs, or vegetables for a refreshing twist. Try:

- **Lemon or Lime Slices:** Adds a zesty flavor.
- **Mint Leaves:** Provides a refreshing taste.
- **Berries:** For a hint of sweetness without added sugar.
- **Cucumber Slices:** Offers a crisp, clean flavor.

By making your water more enticing, you'll likely drink more throughout the day.

### Track Your Intake with a Journal

Sometimes, going analog is the way to go. Keep a simple water journal to monitor your intake. Every time you drink a glass of water, jot it down. This method helps raise awareness of your hydration and allows you to notice patterns over time. To make it easier:

- **Choose a Notepad:** Select a format that you find easy to use, whether it's a small notebook or a digital document.
- **Be Consistent:** Record your intake daily at the same time.

This practice not only keeps you accountable but can also show your progress, motivating you to continue hydrating.

### Engage in Physical Activity

Exercise increases your need for fluids, so it‚Äôs important to drink water before, during, and after physical activity. Keeping a water bottle near you while you work out can encourage you to replenish what you lose through sweat.

### Conclusion

Staying adequately hydrated is essential for maintaining overall health and well-being. By understanding the science behind daily water intake, you can tailor your consumption to meet your individual needs.

I'm sitting in my living room with a fresh cup of coffee and one of the cats snoozing behind me. The day just started, Love went to work and I stay at home, as I always do.
In front of me is the dinner table overloaded with medical stuff, bandages, plasters, salve, ointments and cr√®mes. Several packages of anonymous looking sterile dressings are still sealed to get them the least contaminated as possible. 
Rolls in all sizes and even colours give a hint of tape and plasters but there are so many that you can't tell what is what exactly. 

A pack of baby wipes is laying next to it, waiting for me to pull one out and start this session with very gently cleaning the blood of my face. Besides it lays a little double mirror, the kind you would normally find in a woman's purse, that is there to check the damage of the night. The fact that it folds in two is key, I couldn't bear looking at this face all day long so snapping it closed gives quite some relief. Maybe joy even.

I am trying to conjure up the courage to undergo the process, a process that marks the begin of every day but today I can't seem to get myself to start it.
I dread the feeling of the curved scissors against the wounds; it is designed to not cut into my arms and yet it always manages to pinch a piece of skin here and there, no matter how gentle or askew you handle the thing. Love likes to use the big yellow one that fits his hands better but that bastard has some sharp edges on it. I don't know who designed the thing but they need to take a real good look at themselves.

After the dressings are cut loose the examining of the wounds has to follow. 
Taking off the bandages centimeter by centimeter takes up a lot of time 'cause I need to take deep breaths in between to withstand the pain. Sneaking in sips of coffee adds a few seconds of extra pause so I try to do those as often as I can but Love always catches me doing it.
Every wound then needs to be assessed, judged and treated. In reality that comes down to cleaning them, peeling off the debris at the edges and then putting a shitload of salve on them as quickly as possible.
That would be the easiest part if it wasn't for the itchiness. I find pain so much easier to deal with than an itch; pain is static and located in one spot but itchiness...man, itchiness is all over the place, it's dynamic and surely but slowly drives you mad. We only recently found out I have another condition as well, on top of everything else, which causes itchiness in places that aren't affected, it can occur anywhere, wherever it wants, whenever it wants. Yaay.
In the forthy years of my existence I managed to collect a wide range of weird and rare conditions, leaving me to be the only one in the world with this combination of illnesses.
So much for peer support groups.

But the thing I hate the most is the reapplying of the bandages. The skin immediately starts to itch and it gives me an overwhelming feeling of being restrained and locked up. By taking away the air on my skin my soul is being drained of oxygen as well. Or so it feels.
The stiffness and immobility of my arms and legs is annoying and often painful but it is the tightness around my chest and ribs that really messes me up, even after all these years. It's like there's this huge annoying guy that keeps you in a tight hug all day long, keeps squeezing and squeezing you while you don't like him. Or even know him, for that matter.

If it would only be this one time it would be doable, easy even. But I know I will have to do this again tomorrow. And the day after that. And the day after *that*.
It never stops, I never get to take a break or a vacation far away, I am stuck in this skin that has made it its sole reason of existence to make me as miserable as possible. I don't get to tell it to stop, to stop violating my body, to stop treating me like it is my king and my body is its kingdom. 
I never gave consent to this.

I'm really trying to gather the strength and the grit to do it all again today.

My family is low income so I have never asked for financial help ever since I started working. It was really fun at first, going out for coffee and going on shopping sprees and paying for friends food on occasion since they didn‚Äôt have a job.

This year it started to actually piss me off since they make plans that involve money and complain it all has to be super cheap in order for them to go. They want to reserve plans and expect me to pay in full for them and they pay me months after the event already happened. Im not a bank for them to just do it all the time.

But if anyone wants to meet over a coffee or in my backyard or theirs, share a drink or green, and maybe swap stories about how we ended up here - I've got a decent fire pit and a golden doodle who's better at emotional support than any therapist.

No pressure to talk. We can just exist in the same space and acknowledge that sometimes life just fucking sucks. My dog Rex is cool with silent companions too - he'll just lay his head on your lap and judge nothing.

If this resonates with anyone else drifting through this forced-cheerful season, shoot me a DM. Located in Monument. Sometimes misery really does need company.

They‚Äôre usually small gifts like a holiday card or a $5 gift card for coffee. 

The other day I received a holiday card from a client. I later opened it to find a $100 gift card. I do not feel comfortable accepting this and I believe it would be unethical. Now I need to address it with them when we meet again. 

I‚Äôm just dreading this talk because I haven‚Äôt had to decline a gift from a client before.

Before him I was engaged with a man who cheated on me multiple times, but I was out of the relationship for well over a year before beginning this one and thought I had handled my baggage and thought I was the most confident person in the world going into this one.  I've had some issues come up with this new man, who is wonderful to me, and compatible in so many ways.  All he does is looks at women online (women on facebook, he will go to their accounts for ""eye pleasure"") and of course the occasional OF browsing online.  I know these are not serious issues, and I know that the fact that they make me feel not so good is due to my own past and insecurities and is a response that I really don't want to have, and I'm trying to change how I feel about these things.  I have signed up for health insurance for 2025 and plan to start therapy as soon as I can, so just a month away and I'm so scared and excited! Recently he started a work from home job and has begun a friendship with a woman in his class (who is of course the prettiest woman in the class). This is the only person he really talks to and I always have the worst feeling about it. However, my fianc√© from my past relationship cheated on me twice with coworkers.  So I know where the feelings are coming from and deep down I know they are not valid but it feels like my brain just won't turn off and let me be happy.  This is now really affecting my relationship and I don't want it to, and I'm so frustrated with myself. I just really want to hear from the internet that I'm being crazy and overreacting and need to calm down! Maybe hearing it from others will really sink it in? And would really appreciate if anyone here has dealt with similar in the past and has any coping methods I can take to make my brain go a different direction until I can start therapy with a professional.

TLDR: I (28F) am very insecure and waiting for Jan 2025 to see a therapist to help. These are the messages between my boyfriend (30M) and his new coworker.  I know I'm being ridiculous but can't seem to stop my brain from running and need the internet to tell me how much I'm overreacting and hopefully give me any coping mechanisms to deal with my insecurities until I can get real help. 

Edit: I have had diagnosed ADHD since I was a child and I am currently unmedicated. I have always struggled with emotions feeling stronger than they should.  Another reason I am excited to be starting back up on health insurance.

1hitugt,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1hitugt/i_think_it_is_time/,I think it is time,"To my lovely S&T,

For the past few weeks I have been reading so many letters here and decided to officially write you one. I thought it was time. I have been reminiscing and just missing those initial months of our connection. For a while, I think I missed our conversations, the content and just you as a person.   I loved how we had icebreakers and then we would talk in deep conversations about those topics and how it would open up other stories. I think my favorite response to date is how you responded to my icebreaker about being a lemon or lime. Your answer is still my favorite. I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't disappointed in that you didn't want to meet when I asked so many times in those early days. More than anything, I wanted to meet this amazing person who I felt like I had such a unique connection with that I could talk 2-3 hours on the phone about so many things. I am not sure if it was just the timing of the universe or it was just us. I would often imagine us growing old together and what that could have been like. Enjoying our Italian composer together on a date in Italy, or being in a home by the water. Maybe if we could have had a child together. 

There were so many things that I thought about in those early days about you but never really could express. It's why when you said you were interested in keeping things light and were uninterested in meeting, it just really hit home to me that it was not going to work in the long term and that was such a hard pill to swallow for me. 

As I continued to learn more about you, I slowly began to realize that how I felt and how you felt were so different. You would never say it but I think you were happy with most aspects of you life and I don't think that I would have ever been enough for you. I don't think you had it within you to really make a decision on how you felt and pursue that. You always evaluated things logically whereas I would have moved things as much as I could have to make things work for my partner. I also slowly learned that I was not going to be a fit for you. You would never have loved me as I am today. You needed prestige and importance from your partner and there is no guarantee that I would ever be in the position, even if I aspired to. Lastly, I think I was correct in breaking things off. I think I would have just continued to be disappointed and hurt by you. You were so judgemental in those last days for me and I honestly, I could never be with someone like that. I have no idea how other people in your life with you could be in your life when that's how you truly felt. I felt shocked and hurt and just realized that we would never have the same dynamic we had in the first place. I think we wanted different things and at the end of the day, even if our meeting was serendipitous, our ending was not.   

I wish I could have remained friends though. I do regret that. Even now when I think about how I wish I could tell updates in my life. How my new job is going or how you were so very right about concerns of meeting. They were all true or how I once thought I could see us growing old together and just enjoying each other and we could laugh. It's been a while, but I think I have slowly moved on. You were right. There are so many people in the world. I met someone new recently and for the first time in awhile, I have not thought you about you or missed talking to you. For the first time in a while, I haven't been sad or regretful about my decision to end things or how you wouldn't be in my future. I think at the end of the day, I was sad about meeting this wonderful person and the future we could have had. It takes two people to want that and while I always wanted that, I'm positive you didn't. I finally feel happy with how things are going and I wish you all the best. I hope that if you see me on the slopes, in an airport, or at coffee shop that you stop me to say hi and catch up. You're accent will give you away, but I know I would listen to you talk any day.

Cheers my lovely friend! I wish you all the best!

As a self-proclaimed coffee addict, I wanted to share my excitement about these two amazing Nespresso machines that have completely elevated my coffee game. On the left, we have the stunning Nespresso Creatista, my favorite for crafting caf√©-style drinks with a personal touch. On the right is the ever-reliable Nespresso Lattissima, perfect for quick and creamy coffee indulgences.

The Creatista makes me feel like a barista at home, with its customizable settings and the ability to create silky milk froth for cappuccinos, lattes, and even latte art (still working on that perfect rosetta!). The precision it offers makes every cup feel like a masterpiece.

The Lattissima, on the other hand, is my go-to for those busy mornings when I need a rich cappuccino or latte at the push of a button. Its built-in milk system ensures a smooth and creamy texture every time, making it the perfect machine for effortless indulgence.

Owning both machines has been a dream come true for me, as they cater to different moods and occasions. Whether I‚Äôm taking my time to create something special with the Creatista or enjoying the simplicity and speed of the Lattissima, every cup is pure joy.

I‚Äôve worn it all night, every night (barring one night where I forgot it on a trip) ever since, and it‚Äôs continued to be life changing. 

However, over the last several months, I‚Äôve noticed myself being excessively tired throughout the day. It‚Äôs not bad enough where I shouldn‚Äôt be driving or anything, but even after 7-9 hours of sleep each night, I could easily take a nap every day. I only allow myself to do that on my days off, because there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm napping on my 30-minute lunch break, but I easily could. 

I‚Äôve put on a decent chunk of weight over the last few years, and I‚Äôve never been overly active, so I suppose it could have to do with that. Diet hasn‚Äôt really significantly changed, but it‚Äôs admittedly not exactly healthy most of the time. I stay plenty hydrated. Caffeine is generally only about a cup of coffee a day due to anxiety.

A question specifically for those choosing to stay- do y'all have action plans for slips and relapses? What logical consequences do you have for those? I'm struggling to think of any that aren't vengeful/ petty/ based in an attempt to control him.

A little about me + my situation- I'm 35 F, working hard to keep my own wants and needs in sight through this. I'm in a relationship with my partner (34M) of 7 years. So far, no plans to change that; we still love each other, still enjoy spending time together, still see a future together once we find a way through this. 

He's never been sexually attracted to me (or anyone ""real"" for that matter), doesn't really enjoy sex, and manages maybe one orgasm per quarter with me. Sex isn't a defining pillar of our relationship, so I was largely OK with this and some porn use, so long as it wasn't more important + more enjoyable than sex with me.

Well... we identified his porn addiction 5 years ago. I'd counted all the models he followed on Instagram (over 500 of them) and gone through his search history, confronted him, and made known how much it hurt me. He was genuinely sorry, and put in work to do better + regain my trust. 

I was under the impression that he'd kicked it completely since then. Two weeks ago I found out I was wrong. He was able to kick the habit for a few months, and has quietly been in relapse for 4 of those years.

This time around, he scored a 91 on the Problematic Pornography Consumption Scale and self-reports looking at porn 5+ days a week, with 3-4 orgasms a week. I've pointed him toward support groups and self-help books (particularly Patrick Carnes's 30 step method) and the rest is up to him.

Obviously I take this very personally, as most of us probably do. I have sympathy for him, as I'm a (more than a decade sober) alcoholic...but I lived alone back then, and made every effort to keep the people I loved out of harm's way. Thus it's nigh impossible for me to understand his perspective. 

Now I have to figure out how to rebuild my sense of self-worth in the wake of this. My mental state could be summed up in a meme: ""This is fine"", sipping coffee in a house on fire. Yes, I know we're supposed to sit with uncomfortable feelings, that doesn't mean I have to like it.

After that first meeting, my friend, who i‚Äôll call Zoe to make things easier, kept coming back to my job damn near every night I worked. They would text me to ask when i was in, and we started to make plans outside of work. 

I was very stoked to have a new friend, and at first I wasn‚Äôt interested in anything more, but one night when I was working behind the bar, Zoe looks at me when no one else was around and basically said they wanted to hook up with me. That changed a little something in my brain, because then i saw them in a new light, both physically and romantically. Nothing happened that night except for some texting, and afterwards Zoe said something along the lines of maybe we shouldn‚Äôt do it. I was a tad disappointed, but i wanted to respect their boundaries. 

Fast forward a week later, Zoe is at my house super late, they came over around 11:30pm (we are both service industry workers) to watch some movies. We did a double feature of 2 horror movies and we were all cuddled up on the couch sharing a blanket together and what not, getting really close. When the second movie finished around 4-5am we decided it was late and that they should get an uber home. I ordered it and it was on its way, but for some reason i still decided to tell Zoe that I wanted to kiss them really badly, first Zoe said that they didn‚Äôt want to hurt me, which implies they aren‚Äôt looking for anything serious, to which I said i‚Äôd be okay, hormones kinda taking control, and the. they consented and we started making out, so much so that we missed the uber, and then they spent the night. We didn‚Äôt end up getting to bed until around 7-8am for various reasons. I woke up at about 1pm, my body refuses 8 hours of sleep, but they kept sleeping until almost 5. That day did it, something about relaxing in bed all day while having this sleeping beauty next to me changed something inside me, i didn‚Äôt want this to end, and I wanted it more. Once they left things were still good and the texting stayed flirty. One message Zoe sent was about how comfy my bed was and how they needed to sleep in it again, so to me, things were progressing. 

A couple days after that they came to a dinner party i hosted with close friends, a very soft launch of sorts, and it went super well, every one liked Zoe, and i did too a little more. At this point we‚Äôve seen each other almost every day since we‚Äôve met and i‚Äôm starting to feel the early signs of falling for Zoe. 

The next night we hung out we had a deep conversation about boundaries and what weee looking for, i found out Zoe was only 2 months out of a 2 year relationship and things were still very difficult for them. Zoe said they needed time to think about everything, i did also tell Zoe that I was looking for more, i‚Äôve been out of a relationship for almost a year, and my last serious one was almost 2 years ago. 

Anyway the next day we went and played pool for a couple hours at a local bar, no one was there so we got 9 games in a row, and it was a lot of fun, things were still very flirty but when i brought up the idea of us sleeping together again, they shut it down. It didn‚Äôt sour the evening or anything, but I was a tad bummed out. Still, Zoe stopped by my work later when I went in and said something that really changed me, Zoe said they loved me before they left. 

The next day I was holiday shopping and stopped in Zoe‚Äôs work while they were bartending, it ended up getting so busy that they didn‚Äôt have a chance to pick up their medicine; so i was like, i got you. i ran to their pharmacy got the meds, and came back only to find out it was only 1 of the 2 needed bottles, so i insisted on going back, that‚Äôs when i learned that the other bottle was filled at a different location, no big deal, so i got that too. Zoe was super appreciative, and i assured her i‚Äôd do anything for her. They stopped by my bar later that night (i go into work super late sometimes) and we chatted and things were looking good. 

The next night things unraveled a little. When Zoe came into my work the next night i was filled with more desire than ever, i genuinely had started to fall for Zoe, that damn smile and those gorgeous eyes had finally broken me down, and i couldn‚Äôt help but be a flirt. Most of it was received pretty well and one of Zoe‚Äôs coworkers who came by too kinda keyed into it. Me and him talked because he wanted the tea and i spilled a bit. Zoe caught wind of our conversation and confronted me at the end of the night and i confirmed I had told their coworker some stuff, nothing in great detail, but an overview, Zoe wasn‚Äôt mad, but a little anxious that i did that. 

The next day we met up, biked around the city and got coffee together. We had a straight forward conversation, Zoe wants to keep things platonic, stating that they are still in love with their Ex who broke up with them, and wasn‚Äôt ready for anything else. Zoe also said that when they say they love me, they mean it in a general sense and not romantically. Then we both trauma dumped, gave all our lore to each other and really deepened our bond. At this point i‚Äôm trying so hard not to fall in love, but I think i already have, it doesn‚Äôt help that Zoe said they wish that they could‚Äôve felt as much love from their ex as they were willing to give, and i‚Äôm not sitting across a table from Zoe thinking I would be willing to give you the world. Again i went to work after and Zoe stopped by as normal, and things were cool. The next night we did another double feature movie at my place, but this time we didn‚Äôt share a blanket, and no funny buisness went down, i really want to respect Zoe‚Äôs boundaries, i care deeply for Zoe and want to make sure that they‚Äôre getting exactly the care that they need right now. 

Finally we have yesterday, i‚Äôve been going out so much lately that i needed a day of rest so i kinda shut my phone off and relaxed, i ended up writing a song and painting most of the day, and it was pretty great. Then around midnight, Zoe texts me asking if i‚Äôm at work, which i wasn‚Äôt, cause they wanted to stop by. I said I was at home hut if they wanted to talk on the phone we could, Zoe said maybe, after they went to a bar we could possibly talk. I‚Äôm like, okay, no big, but then an hour later i asked again cause i was getting pretty tired, and same answer, they hadn‚Äôt left to go home yet. So im just chilling in bed, hoping they call cause I want to hear Zoe‚Äôs voice, and that when they tell me that they‚Äôre going to go to a friends house, at 2am. This made me jealous and restless, the first time i had felt anything negative from everything. i had started to write out some long text to send about not getting what i need out of this relationship, but i stopped writing it because ive made this very mistake so many times in the past, i calmed myself down by drawing and assured myself i NEED to give Zoe the time and space they deserve, that regardless of being a friend or partner I want to make them happy and give them the best support i possibly can. So i went to bed. 

Zoe ended up texting me again around 4am that their friend Kat had returned from overseas and they were kiki‚Äôing late into the night. So i definitely made the right call to not blow everything the fuck up, Personal growth??? 

I just woke up and haven‚Äôt texted Zoe back yet and honestly i feel like i‚Äôm at a crossroads of sorts, I could use any bit of advice right now. 

TL:DR 
Falling for someone who recently got out of a long term relationship, and they aren‚Äôt quite ready for anything but I think we are a really great match with obvious attraction to one another.

Guess they‚Äôre feeling that ‚Äú21 forever‚Äù vibe. Stability is cute, but with inflation hanging around like an uninvited guest, it‚Äôs giving cautious energy.  

Meanwhile, the spicy crypto tea? They‚Äôre not here for $BTC or other cryptos in domestic payments. Yep, Russia‚Äôs Central Bank is like, ‚ÄúCrypto? Not in my house!‚Äù Even though Prez Putin low-key supported Bitcoin. Awkward, right? üëÄ  

But wait, it gets juicier. Russia‚Äôs Ministry of Finance is working on crypto exports legislation. So, basically‚Äîno $BTC in your morning coffee payments, but it‚Äôs cool for international deals? A complicated situationship, much? üòÖ  

With this back-and-forth, seems like crypto is the ‚Äúhot-but-risky‚Äù crush they‚Äôre not ready to commit to yet. Whatever happens, one thing‚Äôs for sure‚Äîthe future is going to be wild for #crypto and #memecoin fans.

1hitjna,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/1hitjna/love_road_opener/,Love Road Opener,"I've received several requests for this so decided to write up and post.  I tend to go over the top with these things sometimes, but essentially it all comes down to the energy you put into it above the supplies you have on hand.  I hope this helps!

I decided to use a pink and green 7 day candle rather than the traditional orange / green road opener candle, since my intent is to open the road for love.¬† A lot of spiritual shops and botanicas may not carry a pink and green, so a pink candle will work just as well.¬† Next, I set it up on a fireproof plate surrounded by 3 anchor candles set up in a triangle pattern towards me (I chose blue for communication, lavender for healing / forgiveness, and red for love / passion); this is optional just depends on your practice.¬† I placed pink Himalayan salt around the plate and under my candles for grounding and protection before assembling the rest.

I tend to be very heavy handed with herbs, so feel free to use less or choose the ones most important to your intention.¬† All of these are available at most botanicas and spiritual shops, but a few (ie ginger and cinnamon) can be found at your local grocery store.¬† For a road opener, I like to grind up my herbs under a waxing moon and typically save them in baggies for future use anointing candles.¬† I spoke my intentions listed below while grinding them and made sure I was very clear in describing exactly what I intended each herb to do.¬† Remember, these are my intentions, and may not be the same as yours, but should give you a general idea of the purpose of each herb.¬† Also, please feel free to comment if I‚Äôm mixed up on any of my herbal correspondences; I‚Äôm always trying to learn more.¬† The herbs I chose are as follows below:

1. Lemongrass - to promote openness and clear communication; to help to dissolve obstacles and transform negative energy into positive.¬† To clear the way for SP to let his guard down and open up to me.

2. Hyssop ‚Äì to cleanse away past hurts and remove any doubts SP may have towards reconciliation; to help heal and bless new beginning in our relationship.

3. Yarrow ‚Äì Foster harmony and calmness, remove fear, and draw courage; to draw in SP‚Äôs attention and affection to me.¬† Yarrow is known to draw in the attention of those you most want to see.

4. Wild Cherry Bark ‚Äì to help open SP‚Äôs heart and encourage loving communication.¬† To help draw back in SP‚Äôs love and attraction towards me.¬† Also known to add extra power and energy to workings and to help reawaken magical energy to move forward a stalled undertaking.¬†

5. Ginger ‚Äì To reignite SP‚Äôs passionate feelings towards me and heat up the relationship.¬† Also to add extra power and speed things up.

6. Cinnamon ‚Äì To bring warmth, help heal our relationship, and deepen the bond between us.

7. Gentian ‚Äì Help overcome obstacles and remove any blockages preventing reconciliation, while drawing back in SP‚Äôs love and attraction to me.¬† I also like to use this in uncrossings.

8. Orris Root ‚Äì To draw back in and hold SP‚Äôs love and passionate feelings towards me; to encourage loving communication between us.

9. Valerian ‚Äì Quieten and soothe difficult emotions and promote peaceful communication; to increase and draw in SP‚Äôs love, passion, and attraction to me.¬†

Next, I anointed my candles with a mix of reconciliation oil, stubborn target oil, and of course, road opener oil.¬† I rolled my anchor candles in the herb mixture and sprinkled a thin layer on top of my 7 day candle.¬† Be careful not to sprinkle too many on the 7 day one or your candle may not light or will die out quickly.

Again, I‚Äôm very heavy handed with the herbs so I surrounded my plate and candles with the following and spoke my intentions while doing so:

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Peppermint ‚Äì To help stimulate movement, open up the lines of communication, and add extra energy to spell.¬† Also has healing properties and is good for cooling anger or tempers.

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Coffee w/ chicory ‚Äì To speed things up + chicory is known to help open doors and remove obstacles.

3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cinquefoil / Five Finger Grass ‚Äì For extra luck and to increase chance of success.

For all petitions, I believe in keeping things simple rather than writing a paragraph and I typically see faster movement with simpler petitions.¬† If your petition is getting lengthy, you should probably consider breaking it up in multiple workings.¬† For this petition, I simply went with ‚Äúthe road is open for X and X to reconcile in a loving, committed relationship‚Äù.¬† I then folded my petition toward me after anointing with the oils mentioned earlier and placed it under the plate.

I burned the 7 day candle safely when I was home and anointed with a few drops of oils everyday and spent plenty of time praying and putting energy into it each day after relighting / anointing.¬† After it burned out completely, I burned my petition paper and blew the ashes towards the direction of his house and buried the glass jar in a plant in my backyard.

Did it work?¬† It‚Äôs only been a few weeks, and typically most spells I‚Äôve done manifest subtly and slowly over time rather than all at once.¬† But he is now back in communication with me daily and has agreed to see me this weekend, whereas before he was very resistant to seeing me and giving very little communication and ghosting.¬† So I would definitely say it was successful in ‚Äúopening the road‚Äù and I expect it will continue to manifest as I focus on doing the mundane work until then.¬† Best of luck!",6,1734728160.0,Spells,0,1.0,False

Everything was fine, but then she started to do less and much less initiative. So now it's all on me to invite her on a dates, book tables, meet her, escort her. In return all she does she gets late for 15-20 mins excusing this as ""wellpp, that's real me"".

We had a talk about this, about her late arrivals, her sudden change of mood -> she might get mad at me and won't talk to me the whole date and I am at fault for the bad weather, cold, bad choice of a place and not interesting date at all. 

And also we talked about initiative and finances. She doesn't invite me anywhere, didn't ever book a table anywhere, everything I pay for. So I am like: ""hey it makes me sad that you don't want to invite me anywhere and buy me a small cup of coffee just from your will"". In return she freaks out, she is like ""well okay then! let's pay everyone for themselves, cause I have money only for me!"" 

Well I mean, I don't want her to pay for the big dinner, just a small thing, cake, coffee whatever, big costs are on me, but thing is about the initiative, she just doesn't invite me anywhere cause she doesn't want to pay and expects me to take care of it. Now I see her stories at night-club, chilling with friends having some drinks (drinks are pretty expensive, she could get us something for that price actually). And it's been like 2 weeks of no contact, I just texted her week ago how is she doing, she is ""I am fine""

I don't want to double text her, I want her to reach out, but it seems she doesn't want to do so.

And am I in wrong wanting her to get me something small? I see it as "" I invite her for dinner, tomorrow she invites me for little breakfast"" but in this case it seems that I invite for dinner and breakfast, and she just waits for my gestures and then complains for choosing bad place or ""same place over and over again"".

What would you do? I would love to hear both male and female opinion on that one. Thank you!",0,1734727684.0,relationship_advice,24,0.33,False

A little bit more about me: I learned how to knit when I was little, but started getting more into knitting during the pandemic. I mostly make pullovers/cardigans but I have been known to make some shawls and fingerless mitts for my friends and family. I like hand-dyed wool, bright colors, and lace projects. Besides knitting, I like biking, thrift shopping, baking bread, cookies and croissants and I have an anti-social senior cat who enjoys microsnuggle sessions.",1,1734727548.0,aixmarseille,0,1.0,False
1hitb7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/EquivalentReturn4886/comments/1hitb7f/love_matters_top_life_hacks_to_strengthen_your/,Love Matters: Top Life Hacks to Strengthen Your Relationships,"Every relationship‚Äîromantic, familial, or platonic‚Äîrequires care, patience, and effort to flourish. With the complexities of modern life, it's easy to neglect these important connections. But love matters, and with the right habits, you can build and maintain healthier, more fulfilling relationships.

**Here are 10 practical life hacks that will help strengthen your bonds and create deeper, happier connections in your life.**

# Hack #1 ‚Äî Communicate with Intent

https://preview.redd.it/q9m5e938f28e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=69a3c899a4b7bbd55a0a8d51fe414d632f59e076

Communication is the foundation of any [**strong relationship**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/the-winning-secret-to-successful-relationships/). But it's not just about talking‚Äîit's about understanding and being understood.

* Be present when you‚Äôre having a conversation. Put your phone away, focus on the other person, and practice active listening.
* Use ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements, such as ‚ÄúI feel‚Äù or ‚ÄúI need,‚Äù to express your emotions and avoid blaming or attacking the other person.
* Ask questions to understand, not to accuse. Genuine curiosity can help unravel misunderstandings and foster closeness.

***When communication is intentional, it becomes a tool for connection rather than conflict.***

# Hack #2 ‚Äî Schedule Time Together

Busy lives can pull even the closest relationships apart. That's why setting aside uninterrupted time with loved ones is critical.

* Block out time in your calendar as you would for a work meeting or appointment.
* Plan activities you both enjoy, whether that‚Äôs cooking together, taking a walk, or binge-watching a new series.

***Consistency matters more than grand gestures. A weekly date night or family game night can do wonders to strengthen your bond.***

# Hack #3 ‚Äî Be Kind to Each Other

https://preview.redd.it/2gkgzro9f28e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a1805953871e5636d0b625c128201535831923f

Kindness is often underestimated in relationships when, in fact, it‚Äôs essential.

* Small gestures, like making coffee for your partner in the morning or saying [**‚Äúthank you‚Äù**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/say-thank-you-a-fundamental-principle-of-civility/) when they take out the trash, go a long way.
* Compliment each other regularly. These affirmations can boost confidence and show how much you value your relationship.

***Remember, kindness is contagious. The more you extend it to your partner, the more you‚Äôll experience it in return.***

# Hack #4 ‚Äî Learn How to Relate to Each Other

No two people are the same, which is why understanding your differences is crucial.

* Learn each other‚Äôs love language (e.g., words of affirmation, acts of service, gifts, quality time, or physical touch) and express love in the way it‚Äôs best received.
* Practice empathy. Try to see the world through their eyes to better understand their perspectives and experiences.

***Deep relationships embrace differences rather than being overshadowed by them.***

# Hack #5 ‚Äî Set Healthy Boundaries

Boundaries are the invisible rules that create security and respect within a relationship.

* Be clear about your needs, whether it‚Äôs time alone, personal space, or emotional support.
* Respect their [**boundaries**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/8-ways-to-establish-personal-boundaries-for-your-well-being/), too, and avoid overstepping them.

***Healthy boundaries create balance in your relationship and help preserve individual autonomy.***

# Hack #6 ‚Äî Pick Your Battles

Not every disagreement is worth a drawn-out argument. Sometimes, letting go is the wiser choice.

* Assess whether the issue at hand is truly important or just a momentary annoyance.
* Focus on solutions, not blame, to resolve conflicts when they really matter.

***Sometimes, peace is better than being right. Choose harmony where you can.***

# Hack #7 ‚Äî Demonstrate Appreciation Regularly

A little gratitude goes a long way when it comes to strengthening relationships.

* Use phrases like ‚ÄúI appreciate you‚Äù or ‚ÄúThank you for \[specific action\].‚Äù
* Surprise them with a handwritten note, a small gift, or their favorite snack.

***When people see and feel your appreciation, they‚Äôre more likely to reciprocate and deepen the connection.***

# Hack #8 ‚Äî Forgive Quickly and Move On

https://preview.redd.it/cwrfjkwbf28e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c493d517d5f49ccdb0366ab1f6930315c3f6911

Grudges can weigh heavily on relationships, causing tension and resentment to build. [**Forgiveness**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/the-not-so-easy-task-of-forgiveness/) is key.

* When conflicts arise, address them calmly, express your feelings, and work toward resolution.
* Once resolved, avoid bringing up past mistakes during future disagreements.

***Forgiving doesn‚Äôt mean forgetting but choosing to move forward, together, with a clean slate.***

# Hack #9 ‚Äî Spend Time Apart to Nurture Individual Growth

Healthy relationships aren‚Äôt about spending every waking moment together‚Äîthey‚Äôre about balance.

* Pursue hobbies, career goals, or social activities independently.
* Encourage your partner to do the same.

***When both individuals in a relationship can grow on their own, they bring renewed energy and perspective when they come back together.***

# Hack #10 ‚Äî Celebrate Each Other‚Äôs Wins

https://preview.redd.it/wa58ga6ef28e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=73456feb8b6c9249b9516a88c51369b2b0c5663b

Whether it‚Äôs a promotion, a fitness achievement, or simply getting through a tough week, rejoicing in each other‚Äôs successes can strengthen your bond.

* Surprise them with a dinner out or a thoughtful gift when they achieve a milestone.
* Offer words of encouragement and pride when they share their successes.

***Celebrate their victories as if they were your own‚Äîand the joy will be shared.***

# Building a Lasting Connection

Love isn‚Äôt always easy, and every partnership faces its challenges. But with a little effort and intentionality, you can create a bond that feels grounded, fulfilling, and uniquely yours.

If you‚Äôre ready to take your relationship to the next level, start implementing these hacks today. A little practice can lead to a lifetime of connection, growth, and [**happiness**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/10-practical-life-hacks-to-boost-your-happiness/).

Maybe it is a mix of the location and the way customers are in this area, but hey. I didn't come to dive into that. I didn't come to complain, only to concentrate on what I find most positive.

Actually, the reason I made the post is because it makes me meet many new people. I know I barely have the chance to befriend any of them and that judging them based on a ten second interaction is rather dumb, but I cannot help wanting to just tell those kinda customers how much I look forward to seeing them!

Because there is a customer who stitched a pokemon on a white hoodie! I love seeing that hoodie! And I hope that one of these days I will wear my surprised pikachu hoodie for him to see!

Or the customer with a custom face mask. Like??? I do not know why I love it, but I love that it makes her stand out. I love recognizing her!

Or the different types of tourists I see. One purchase and I can already narrow down the area they come from. And it is so cute! I really would love to know what the reasons behind such purchases are, and would love to know a more specific country!

Or the insurance company duo, who always smile and chat so casually! And they smile further when they see me do something stupid (tossing coffee on top of a shelf).

And can you even imagine how much a greeting and a smile can go? Trust me, if I were to compliment every person whose smile makes my day just a little better, I would have a sore throat. And some, I do compliment for their outfits and their smiles, because the world needs more positivity and if I can make it just a little brighter, then I will!",2,1734727204.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I've always wanted a flair, and I've been thinking about getting me the new flair pro 3. I love the idea of a machine that will most likely last forever and that it can deliver quality espresso on par of any more expensive one. 
As I havent been able to try one myself, I really cant say if the prepping is an issue, but I can say, I really enjoy the process of dialing my own pourovers. Now, I will be enjoying my espressos straight, and also using them in lattes and coctails. I know I can solve the frothing issue with a Nanofoamer. 
My second option would be a Bambino Plus. The shot to shot, the milk steamer and the ease of use are all very attractive things but I worry that maybe I might end up outgrowing the machine, or that it will end up breaking in the future.
I live in Mexico, so anyone trying to sell me on a cafelat robot will only sadden me with the reminder that my country is lacking so much in coffee equipment retailing. Importing anything is a no go because of customs' fees.
I currently own a Chestnut C3 Pro for my pour overs.
I guess my budget would be around the price of both machines mentioned. $300 USD to $450.

¬†

48^(th) of Anael, the first month of snow.

Maxwell‚Äôs Journal

Brianna was right. I should have listened to her council this morning. Ouch.

¬†

The Celestial Library

The day dawned bright and early, Max had breakfast with Bri, told her his plans for the day, and she shook her head. ‚ÄúBless your heart my love. I think that‚Äôs an unwise choice, but I won‚Äôt try and stop you.‚Äù

Arriving at the ‚Äúworkshop‚Äù in the library, Max made coffee and waited for the others to arrive. Everyone was assembled by seven, handed their summoning assignments, and sent forth.

Then the trouble began.

‚ÄúAlright Lemon, I‚Äôve picked up a Mud elemental‚Ä¶I mean earth/water elemental.‚Äù Max announced. ‚ÄúDistance is 200m. What does the ‚Äúm‚Äù stand for, anyway? Why isn‚Äôt it in inches?‚Äù

‚ÄúM is for Meters. It is a measurement based on the size of our world.‚Äù Lemon replied, clinging to Max‚Äôs backpack. ‚ÄúIt is much more accurate than inches and feet.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs never going to catch on.‚Äù Max grunted. ‚ÄúNext you‚Äôre going to tell me that you‚Äôve got a new system of weights that people are going to have to learn how to use.‚Äù

Lemon smiled a devilish little smile, ‚ÄúWell actually, yes. Marquee Measures, god of measurements, has come across something called a ‚Äústone‚Äù.‚Äù

Just then an electrically charged ball of water dropped from the ceiling, splashing Max with water and electricity.

‚ÄúDamn it! Why did we summon ALL of the elementals at the same time?‚Äù Max yelled.

Lemon, now hiding under the top flap of the bag, yelled back, ‚ÄúBecause we were in a rush, and not thinking clearly!‚Äù

Max sighed, shaking his head, ‚ÄúI should have listened to Bri.‚Äù

\-

Max and Lemon stared at each other over their respective glasses of whiskey. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs never do that again.‚Äù Max said, taking a swallow of the dark amber liquid.

Lemon nodded, taking his own swig of liquor. ‚ÄúAnd let‚Äôs never speak of this again.‚Äù

Max nodded in response.

The pair stayed up late drinking.

\-

49^(th) of Anael,

We have a range of about 218 yards on our stick of elemental detection. We get distance and direction from the stick, but that‚Äôs about it. We need a generic elemental detection device too, otherwise we will be walking around flipping through some thirty choices at random. Gah! This is annoying! At least at this point I can do the detection enchantment myself.

I am already tired of working on this project. If I was just working by myself or just one or two other people, that would be fine. Working with and managing a dozen people? Nope. Especially not gods. Never again. Herding cats is easier.

50^(th) of Anael,

Basic detection charm is complete. Anything elemental will trigger the alarm if I‚Äôm within 200 yards. I‚Äôm going to start tomorrow with a street-by-street search.

The Research and Development team for the stick has been compensated, called a success, and disbanded. Research on the cistern/well (turns out it acted as both, apparently) is ongoing. The individuals working the well are currently working on figuring out what the rope was that was around the top, and what properties it held. I wish them luck.

We have found out‚Ä¶ Bri found out what happened to the ship. It was caught in a gigantic whirlpool a hundred or so miles off shore. At least according to Madam Beatrix, the local soothsayer. My heart grieves for the lost.

It's been a week. Not from hell, but just annoying. The kids been with me for a month straight, and I've had to babysit them to get homework done. They started out with 90+ assignments past due, and need doing by the end of semester. They have worked that down to about half left while keeping up with new assignments. This has been taking a tool on both of us, physically, mentally and emotionally. Mostly the last two. That's why output and quality have been lagging. I'm sorry about that.

It has finally snowed properly here in the TC Metro area. Around 4-5 inches. It is a balmy 18F (-7.78C) at my home right now. Really curtails my smoking habit when my snot freezes to my face while smoking.

Sunday's twitch stream is up on Youtube, for any who missed it. I seem to have fixed the problem I had 2 weeks ago. Link below.

Had to DMCA someone Tuesday for reading the blacksmith on YT without my permission. If you want to do it, ask permission, and don't use AI to do the reading! Pretty simple.

Anyway, I'm broke and need money for ammo, so donate if you want to.

1hit1o3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hit1o3,"Shows that handled mental issues really well without it being a ""Special Episode.""","1 and 2: American Dad.

1: An Incident at Owl Creek. 
Mental Issues: Extreme Anxiety. 

After an embarrassing moment at a pool party, Stan because so embarrassed that he faked his family death several times in hopes of getting away from his shame. He eventually tries to poison Obama in hopes that it could allow him to be seen as not a laughing stock. But after Obama tells him he shouldn't worry about what other people think about, it's revealed that it just a fantasy before the embarrassment. 

It's a great show case of how some process anxiety. Through out the episode, Stan is constantly trying to make sure that nothing embarrassing can happen. Constantly overthinking things, controlling every outcome. And once he loses control, he has a fantasy not far off from when a person with anxiety doom spirals leading to the worst possible outcome.

2. Productive Panice

Mental Issue: Imposter Syndrome

While at a party hosted by Hideki Yoshida, Francine is embarrassed that she doesn't have anything interesting happening. She admits to Klaus later on that she been doing some pottery and after a bit of encouragement, displace one of here pots on a small shelf in a coffee shop. This leads to her pot being praised as an introvertive art piece and her becoming a famous artist. But after a misunderstanding, garbage gets summited as her next piece and is praised just as much. This leads to Francine having a meltdown where she conversation with her younger self and realize that she is holding herself to unreasonable standards. She wakes up to realize that she still at the party and had imagined the whole thing. She decided that maybe just enjoy her art and not get overly judgemental about her work.

It's a great example about how even if a hundred people say you are doing a great job, it take one negative voice for someone with Imposter Syndrome to spiral, even if their own. It also shows that it not just, ""You suck and your work sucks."" It's also the belief that if you do receive praise, everyone is crazy and you are the sane one because you know it's not good 

3. Bojack Horseman. Time's Arrow

Mental Issues: The effects of Child abuse and generation trauma.

After finding out that his mother has been poisoning his believed to be daughter, Bojack finally has enough with his dementia mother. He plans to drop her off at a nursing home and just be done with her. But during the trip there, we see the memories of a young Beatrice. From memories of her childhood were she was traumatized by the results of her mother lobotomy, the destruction of all her dolls due to a case scarlet fever, to how controlling her father was. We see how pain she went through as Butterscotch became neglectful and cheated on her, resulting in a child. Eventually, she has a moment of lucidity and Bojack, instead of taking the moment to give back some of the pain she caused, decided to give her one last moment of happiness.

It's a amazing example of how abuse can become a cycle. How it doesn't excuse one actions but shows that you never truly know everything a person goes through. How both circumstances in and out of someones control can lead to some painful moments. But also the chance of trying to do better might help you more than the give the pain back.",5,1734726802.0,TopCharacterTropes,3,0.73,False

Every relationship‚Äîromantic, familial, or platonic‚Äîrequires care, patience, and effort to flourish. With the complexities of modern life, it's easy to neglect these important connections. But love matters, and with the right habits, you can build and maintain healthier, more fulfilling relationships.

**Here are 10 practical life hacks that will help strengthen your bonds and create deeper, happier connections in your life.**

# Hack #1 ‚Äî Communicate with Intent

https://preview.redd.it/ghwxxphac28e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=92ecd49a91386a9fc3a2df29ff4ea37ad37a86cc

Communication is the foundation of any [**strong relationship**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/the-winning-secret-to-successful-relationships/). But it's not just about talking‚Äîit's about understanding and being understood.

* Be present when you‚Äôre having a conversation. Put your phone away, focus on the other person, and practice active listening.
* Use ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements, such as ‚ÄúI feel‚Äù or ‚ÄúI need,‚Äù to express your emotions and avoid blaming or attacking the other person.
* Ask questions to understand, not to accuse. Genuine curiosity can help unravel misunderstandings and foster closeness.

***When communication is intentional, it becomes a tool for connection rather than conflict.***

# Hack #2 ‚Äî Schedule Time Together

Busy lives can pull even the closest relationships apart. That's why setting aside uninterrupted time with loved ones is critical.

* Block out time in your calendar as you would for a work meeting or appointment.
* Plan activities you both enjoy, whether that‚Äôs cooking together, taking a walk, or binge-watching a new series.

***Consistency matters more than grand gestures. A weekly date night or family game night can do wonders to strengthen your bond.***

# Hack #3 ‚Äî Be Kind to Each Other

https://preview.redd.it/i4t3zb7cc28e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=fee96541de3d7e3a1ff51af174809b93d4006fc9

Kindness is often underestimated in relationships when, in fact, it‚Äôs essential.

* Small gestures, like making coffee for your partner in the morning or saying [**‚Äúthank you‚Äù**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/say-thank-you-a-fundamental-principle-of-civility/) when they take out the trash, go a long way.
* Compliment each other regularly. These affirmations can boost confidence and show how much you value your relationship.

***Remember, kindness is contagious. The more you extend it to your partner, the more you‚Äôll experience it in return.***

# Hack #4 ‚Äî Learn How to Relate to Each Other

No two people are the same, which is why understanding your differences is crucial.

* Learn each other‚Äôs love language (e.g., words of affirmation, acts of service, gifts, quality time, or physical touch) and express love in the way it‚Äôs best received.
* Practice empathy. Try to see the world through their eyes to better understand their perspectives and experiences.

***Deep relationships embrace differences rather than being overshadowed by them.***

# Hack #5 ‚Äî Set Healthy Boundaries

Boundaries are the invisible rules that create security and respect within a relationship.

* Be clear about your needs, whether it‚Äôs time alone, personal space, or emotional support.
* Respect their [**boundaries**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/8-ways-to-establish-personal-boundaries-for-your-well-being/), too, and avoid overstepping them.

***Healthy boundaries create balance in your relationship and help preserve individual autonomy.***

# Hack #6 ‚Äî Pick Your Battles

Not every disagreement is worth a drawn-out argument. Sometimes, letting go is the wiser choice.

* Assess whether the issue at hand is truly important or just a momentary annoyance.
* Focus on solutions, not blame, to resolve conflicts when they really matter.

***Sometimes, peace is better than being right. Choose harmony where you can.***

# Hack #7 ‚Äî Demonstrate Appreciation Regularly

A little gratitude goes a long way when it comes to strengthening relationships.

* Use phrases like ‚ÄúI appreciate you‚Äù or ‚ÄúThank you for \[specific action\].‚Äù
* Surprise them with a handwritten note, a small gift, or their favorite snack.

***When people see and feel your appreciation, they‚Äôre more likely to reciprocate and deepen the connection.***

# Hack #8 ‚Äî Forgive Quickly and Move On

https://preview.redd.it/4teruiogc28e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7cf963d95c7ebe528a286cd48e7c422c88b5d11

Grudges can weigh heavily on relationships, causing tension and resentment to build. [**Forgiveness**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/the-not-so-easy-task-of-forgiveness/) is key.

* When conflicts arise, address them calmly, express your feelings, and work toward resolution.
* Once resolved, avoid bringing up past mistakes during future disagreements.

***Forgiving doesn‚Äôt mean forgetting but choosing to move forward, together, with a clean slate.***

# Hack #9 ‚Äî Spend Time Apart to Nurture Individual Growth

Healthy relationships aren‚Äôt about spending every waking moment together‚Äîthey‚Äôre about balance.

* Pursue hobbies, career goals, or social activities independently.
* Encourage your partner to do the same.

***When both individuals in a relationship can grow on their own, they bring renewed energy and perspective when they come back together.***

# Hack #10 ‚Äî Celebrate Each Other‚Äôs Wins

https://preview.redd.it/a2nulswic28e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=32f7caac4531830f2632fd90da21286e48334b0a

Whether it‚Äôs a promotion, a fitness achievement, or simply getting through a tough week, rejoicing in each other‚Äôs successes can strengthen your bond.

* Surprise them with a dinner out or a thoughtful gift when they achieve a milestone.
* Offer words of encouragement and pride when they share their successes.

***Celebrate their victories as if they were your own‚Äîand the joy will be shared.***

**Building a Lasting Connection**

Love isn‚Äôt always easy, and every partnership faces its challenges. But with a little effort and intentionality, you can create a bond that feels grounded, fulfilling, and uniquely yours.

If you‚Äôre ready to take your relationship to the next level, start implementing these hacks today. A little practice can lead to a lifetime of connection, growth, and [**happiness**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/10-practical-life-hacks-to-boost-your-happiness/).

After doing IVF, one of the rounds was lucky and we succeeded. I had a really hard pregnancy, I puked a lot throughout the 9 months, I got covid, some bleeding, etc but was lucky to give birth to a lovely and perfectly healthy baby girl. 
My husband went back to work, we only have my mom around as family. Nobody else in the same country as us. 
I am an only child and I love my mom. She raised me alone, did her best and I turned out good. I am very thankful for her. She's retired now and lives alone with her cat. 
Being home alone with the baby all day, all week, all the time has been very stressful for me, I got PPD, got medication for it but still I feel lonely and exhausted sometimes. Baby girl is amazing and such a good kid, rarely cries, sleeps theough the night, plays nicely with the cats etc but still it takes a lot of effort and struggle to keep the house clean, cook, wash etc. I have been asking my mum to come visit us, since it's a 10-15min drive and she has a car. She maybe comes once every 1-2 months. I kept pushing and asked her to come see us more often, maybe every friday for a cup of coffee or smth, maybe stay with the baby for half an hour so I can clean the house a bit or take a shower. She got upset and told me that she has her own life and is busy and tired sometimes and that I shouldn't just assume she would be around all the time to help out and raise my child. This hurt me a lot, I cried for weeks over it and can't seem to get over it, feeling so dissappointed, alone and helpless.

May 12

Some of the weirdest shit just happened, and I don‚Äôt know where else to turn. I don‚Äôt really know where to start, to make things worse. This is my first post, I believe, so I apologize if it‚Äôs slightly illegible. I am not a poet, and what happened has me pretty fucking rattled.

Have you ever had a day where, with no real reason whatsoever, things seemed to go against you at every instance? You wake up to cat piss in your bed and you don‚Äôt own a cat; you forgot to empty the old coffee grounds in the coffee machine after putting in a massive layer of new grounds on top and breaking the coffee machine inexplicably; your car‚Äôs battery dies midway out of you pulling out of your driveway and you‚Äôre basically emergency parked in the middle of the busy street and the tow company is stuck in traffic caused by your unfortunate park job; the coffee place you went to accidentally gave you a small cup of coffee with spoiled milk and you didn‚Äôt know until you left the building and got back into your rental car that you were nearly denied had it not been for the sweet soul of the front desk person who smudged some rules to give me a fair deal; despite knowing how terrible your day started, your boss still rips you a new one for being late which led to a meeting with HR and facing a real possibility that you wouldn‚Äôt have a job if anything happened again; your card declines at a luncheon and you have to settle for some free fruits (two apples, an orange, and a banana,) and a couple of spare granola bars that your coworker was kind enough to spare‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs more, but I‚Äôve listed so many already.

This all sounds like a nightmare for some folks, but this was my morning. I wish I could say the rest of the day was just mildly frustrating if not downright infuriating, but after I somehow managed to convince my boss to leave early, I got home to someone tagging my parking spot in the garage with the weirdest sprawling lines I‚Äôve ever seen. I did try to take pictures of the lines, but my phone‚Äôs rear camera broke when it fell out of my pocket during lunch and the front has a weird glare in the lens that just appeared. I wish that was the worst of the tagging, but the scribbling lines almost seemed to lead into the building straight to my apartment. Hell, there were lines in the damn elevator that lined up. It was like lines on a kid‚Äôs drawing, almost like a fake pirate‚Äôs map that doesn‚Äôt have a set location of the treasure. The lines that almost didn‚Äôt lead directly to my door were violently scrawled over, like it was wrong. My damn door was covered in those lines, too, but more like a circle surrounded by very small question marks surrounding the door frame well beyond the neighbors‚Äô doors and on the ceiling. I freaked out so much I called the cops and the front desk about everything. They tried pulling footage of the garage and the hallways, but the cameras must‚Äôve been broken. The officers, Wilson and Singh, told me they‚Äôd look in my apartment for anything and that I did the right thing by not going inside and calling them first. They set me up with a hotel room in the meantime.

Jesus I‚Äôm tired. It‚Äôs not even that late in the day. What the cops said about me doing the right thing‚Ä¶ it feels off for some reason and I can‚Äôt for the life of me figure out why. Maybe once they give me an update, I‚Äôll ask them to clarify, if they can. If that weird shit was involved in a whole ass other crime (or worse), what the fuck does that mean for me? I‚Äôm getting anxious just thinking about the possibilities. I‚Äôve told the front desk not to forward calls to me or to send anything to my door per Officer Wilson‚Äôs orders. I‚Äôm exhausted, but I don‚Äôt know if I can sleep. I guess I can try. What else can I do?

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

May 20

Shit got weirder.

It‚Äôs been a week since the graffiti shit happened. I‚Äôm still at the hotel. Officer Singh dropped by the day after everything happened to let me know that the room is still being thoroughly investigated, but what they found was‚Ä¶ God, it‚Äôs weird to type out. It was like the room was turned into a drawing. The walls were slanted at weird angles, the appliances were vastly out of proportion to each other and the surfaces they were on, but the stuff with the lights? Holy shit. Any room with a light on had those little lines of rays that kids draw to show light, but when the lights turn off, the fucking lines disappear. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. If it wasn‚Äôt for the bodycam footage, I wouldn‚Äôt have believed it either. It sounds whacked.

I‚Äôm fucking wreaked. I managed to get HR to approve my time off for ‚Äúemergency mental health reasons‚Äù. I can‚Äôt work with this shit running in the background of my mind and act like everything‚Äôs gonna be fine. I barely have a proper grip on reality right now. Weed doesn‚Äôt help, and the bar downstairs (while being super sweet about it and I do absolutely understand and get the reason why) isn‚Äôt allowed to send me any more alcohol. I guess I drank a dent in their inventory and I was costing them a pretty penny in reordering supplies. Whoops. Thank you, Doordash and Instacart.

The apartment complex has fully dropped my lease, no fee, nothing. The head maintenance guy went with the cops the first time into that place. He quit right after. I‚Äôm looking into getting a new place soon-ish, but given that my belongings are not physically possible to exist, furniture and clothes are a luxury at the moment.

My music app has been acting up as well. It stops playing my music for like 20 seconds, then I hear something like humming, only I don‚Äôt know the song. Swear to G if my life is a real-life fucking creepypasta.

Upside, got my car back. I guess it just needed a new battery. I need to eat, I‚Äôm too hungry to think.

May 26

I got my phone replaced yesterday. I guess I had some malware installed without knowing it and my entire phone just‚Ä¶ broke. None of the apps worked, few actually opened. Stupid thing had some bizarre ‚Äúgame‚Äù on it that I didn‚Äôt really know how to play, but it played that same song like the humming from the music app. How have things gotten so weird? I‚Äôm done with all this. Please, God, I‚Äôm so tired.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Jun 5

Well fuck.

My car is basically internally totaled and the mechanics don‚Äôt know how or why. From what they‚Äôev told me, it just ‚Äústopped working‚Äù, and popping the hood only confused them more. It was like everything was made of plastic, like a Barbie doll car or an RC car. Same engineering design of the inside, but fake. As if it was just for display.

So on top of getting a new apartment, I now need a new car. Fuck me running.

To make things worse, that stupid game is back on my phone. I swear I can hear the humming in my sleep sometimes. It‚Äôs almost haunting. I‚Äôm so tired.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Jun 8

I finally figured out that ‚Äúgame‚Äù, sorta. Like it gave me a choice. Damn thing opens on its own, sometimes. I would just close the game and turn my phone off but curiosity and dead cats, and all that jazz.

I was right, it‚Äôs not really a game per se, but a graphic novel of sorts‚Ä¶ if a child made one. Like a choose-your-own-adventure graphic novel made by kids, for kids, so no real story to follow at all. From what I‚Äôve gathered, the main character is a little girl, and she has an imaginary friend named SAM or something like that. As the little girl, you control your imaginary friend via benign prompts like ‚Äúpick doll up‚Äù and ‚Äúdance silly‚Äù. Kid shit, y‚Äôknow? Like kid games should be, but with worse graphics and designs. The little girl is a stick figure drawing with red pigtails and a green dress with yellow and blue flowers on it, and SAM‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt look like how I expected him to look. He was short and bulky, like a cardboard box filled with too much stuff that bent the sides out, wearing a white shirt with SAM in bold black letters. His legs were like twigs, skinny and tall, and a comically wide stance covered in weird blue pants that disappeared under the shirt and big black shoes. His arms were similar, but long, longer than they should be, and were bent at sharp angles, ending with what looked like those hook claws from arcade games, but his face‚Ä¶ It was wider on one side, but longer on the other. His mouth was almost star shaped, warping to the shape of the face and filled with pin needle teeth. The eyes were somehow worse. One eye was large and cloudy blue‚Äì cataracts? Maybe. The other eye was small but wide and extended over one corner of his mouth over the longer side of the face with a black dot serving as a pupil. For some reason it was obvious the smaller eye wasn‚Äôt useful in any way, and the blue eye always seemed like it was looking at me the few times the app opened.

I did manage to find a cheap-ish apartment right next to the subway and bus lines. At least I don‚Äôt have to worry about how I‚Äôm getting to work if I get the place. Silver linings and all that.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Jun 19

I GOT THE PLACE!!!! I move in next week! Oh thank Christmas. I never wanna stay at another hotel for a long fucking time.

Mom set up a storage unit for me in town and stuffed it to the brim with furniture from Ikea that she had Dad, Linette, and Marcus fix up for me. Marcus also said he and Mom can help me out with getting a car while Dad and Linette worked on getting me clothes and knick knacks to make my new place feel homey.

The police haven‚Äôt really updated me about my old place since Officer Singh told me about what they found last time and I can‚Äôt build up the courage to ask. Mainly because I wouldn‚Äôt know how to ask, and I‚Äôd rather not really know.

That damn app still opens itself up from time to time, but only if I‚Äôm alone, and only when I‚Äôm using my phone. Only this last time was disturbing as fuck.

App opened up like usual, but something about the main screen was off. SAM still looks creepy, but the little girl has gone from smiling to a weirdly neutral face, and her dress went from a cute little green dress to a black dress and a big black hat. They‚Äôre standing next to a big brown mound on the scribbled grass flooring, almost like a grave. The game prompted something along the lines of, ‚Äúshe isn‚Äôt here anymore‚Äù with the choices being ‚Äúcry‚Äù or ‚Äúlaugh‚Äù.

I closed the app after that. So far it hasn‚Äôt opened back up yet.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Jun 22

My fucking storage unit got tagged.

Same scribbled lines. Same question marks surrounding my unit. Same drawing furniture.

How. The fuck. Is this happening.

My folks are beyond confused. Rightly so. My step-parents are talking to the cops out front.

I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Hotel, here I come.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Jun 28

The goddamn game cha

‚ÄìEDIT: On laptop, finishing post now‚Äì

The goddamn game changed.

The little girl was lying down, crying. Same little black dress, the hat drawn flung off to the side. Sam was center of the screen. He wasn‚Äôt smiling anymore.

The prompt on screen asked, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Mommy?‚Äù

The only answer I was prompted to give was, ‚Äúfind her‚Äù

I closed the game and threw my phone in the closet.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Jul 2

I got a laptop. I managed to save my previous notes from my phone on it and update the one I started after the game opened up. I pray I don‚Äôt find that fucking game again. I haven‚Äôt touched my phone since I threw it in the closet. Here‚Äôs hoping the damn thing died.

My stuff is still cartoon-ized. Again. I don‚Äôt know how they cleared out the storage unit. Don‚Äôt know, don‚Äôt wanna know.

Sort of.

I called the police and asked about my case file, which transferred me to a detective named MacKenzie, I think. She told me the officers in charge of my case were dismissed for erratic, nearly violent behaviors following the weird discovery. She reminded me that all this was still under investigation, but she might have a lead.

Det. MacKenzie told me about another case similar to my case, where a woman‚Äôs house was marked up and ‚Äúvandalised‚Äù, she called it, and the woman went insane, saying things like ‚Äúshe‚Äôs coming for me, I wasn‚Äôt paying enough attention, I didn‚Äôt love her enough‚Äù, creepy stuff like that. It was three weeks of constant calls about her screaming down the street and getting at least three arrests to finally get her into the psych ward. Apparently she calmed down in the psyche ward, but kept up the muttering of someone finding her.

The detective took a minute to tell me this next part, and I nearly threw up.

It was another week until they found her body in pieces, covered in clumps of ‚Äúblack sand and a dark pink rubber material‚Äù, but the pieces looked like they were ‚Äúerased‚Äù, since no more parts of her could be found. She had her phone on her, and it looked like it exploded from the inside. Like someone smashed a window from the inside of the house.

I still haven‚Äôt gotten my phone out of the closet. I don‚Äôt want to anymore.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Jul 18

Detective MacKenzie came over today. I never realized that we were close in age, all of our talks have been over the phone. She brought over files from similar cases that ended in the same bizarre way. Some were from different states, and two were in different countries. I almost asked why she brought over all this, but the frazzled look on her face shut me up. Something tells me something happened to her, too. Not sure what, I wasn‚Äôt gonna ask. She went almost in circles about how everything nearly ended the same, every victim in pieces, missing the parts that were ‚Äúerased‚Äù. Like a drawing.

Then she pulled out her phone.

She was playing the game. SAM wasn‚Äôt smiling. He was crying. The little girl was gone.

Then I saw the prompt.

‚ÄúFind her‚Äù

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Jul 22

I finally got the courage to grab my phone out of the closet. If it was dead, I didn‚Äôt check. I kept it face down and plugged it in, then looked over the files Det MacKenzie left. What I‚Äôve gathered is that all 16 of the victims were women, all in their mid-30s, all with variations of strawberry blonde to bright red hair. At least four of the six victims had dyed hair, pitch black, like it made a difference.

How did I even get into this mess? Fuck, I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have to look at my phone eventually. Maybe something changed.

SAM is alone. Crying. And pointing to the right, toward the window.

I shouldn‚Äôt have checked.

There‚Äôs a woman out there, wiry bright red pigtails... I thought her dress was black but it‚Äôs just covered in black sand, turning it gray.

She‚Äôs crying. Wailing. There was something in her hand.

I need to leave. Now.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Jul 28

Detective MacKenzie‚Äôs dead. Same way. I need to go.

She can‚Äôt find me right now. I don‚Äôt know how, but she can‚Äôt see me. I have to find a way to get around her. I can‚Äôt die like this.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Aug 3

I finally left the hotel. Had to. She was close to finding me. I couldn‚Äôt stay there. First thing I wanted to do was fly somewhere not here, but I read the damn files. I‚Äôm still being hunted. What the fuck did I do? What DO I do? I‚Äôm scared shitless, but I can‚Äôt run for long.

Who am I supposed to find?

SAM only cries if she‚Äôs nearby. He doesn‚Äôt prompt me for anything, just stares back, the eerily wide smile gone. Maybe he can hear me? I must be going insane. I‚Äôll try to get set up at another hotel. I‚Äôm in dire need of a shower. I‚Äôve been driving for hours. I need to stop. Just for now. I need a breather.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Aug 4

He can hear me.

He answers in prompts. Prompts I can only verbally respond to. My first question was if he could, in fact, hear me.

YES, I CAN HEAR YOU. In big, bold, sprawled letters on the screen. I asked who I had to find.

HER.

Why?

MOMMY LEFT US. WE WANT HER BACK. FIND HER.

Who is we?

BETTY. SHE ISN‚ÄôT HERE NOW. SHE WANTS MOMMY BACK REALLY BAD. FIND HER.

How the hell am I supposed to respond to that? I asked instead if he knew Mommy‚Äôs name. It was really the only other thing I could think of. SAM‚Äôs mouth somehow twisted more.

THAT WASN‚ÄôT MOMMY. SHE WAS A LIAR. WE WANT MOMMY. NOT HELEN. WHERE IS MOMMY?

Ok so I have a start. I gotta get my laptop, I need to look up these names. Nothing is making sense anymore.

The names that came up led to some weird article about a woman named Helen Jeffers who stole a baby from a hospital in buttfuck nowhere New Jersey in the mid-to-late 90‚Äôs. She was some sort of fucked up in the head, according to the article, but about eight years later, a woman‚Äôs body was found in pieces in her home after a wellness check from Helen‚Äôs estranged husband (who was not named, I guess for anonymity). Same small pieces, same black sand that was tested as a graphite and eraser rubber mix. The little girl was never found.

Fuck.

Fuck fuck fuck.

SAM is crying. I need to go.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Aug 8

SAM stopped crying finally. Four days of driving nonstop except to sleep and get food and gas. I look insane. I feel insane. A drawing on my phone is helping me survive. Sort of. I‚Äôve asked him more questions since, but it‚Äôs like asking a 6 year old child about advanced algebra. I have to be careful about how I ask my questions. SAM isn‚Äôt good with complicated questions. He doesn‚Äôt really answer in anything longer than a couple sentences. Mostly it‚Äôs been small tidbits of random word bile for a bit, stuff like SHE WANTS MOMMY BACK and FIND HER, but I did learn that Betty found out about her birth mom when Helen let slip that she wasn‚Äôt her mommy, and that something happened right after. I didn‚Äôt ask for more info. I had a feeling I knew where that line of questioning would go.

Betty‚Äôs getting closer. SAM‚Äôs giant blue eye has that weird cartoon glint on it. I need to leave here, too. Soon. I can‚Äôt stop for a while yet.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Aug 12

Jesus Christ, I think I know where Mommy is.

Now I have to make sure Betty can‚Äôt find me, not yet. SAM isn‚Äôt crying yet so I might have a chance.

I‚Äôm gonna ask him about the dirt mound in the background of the drawing.

1hispte,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1hispte/why_do_people_ignore_me/,Why Do People Ignore Me?,"For years, I‚Äôve been struggling with connecting with people, especially when it is not in person.  Since graduating several years ago and reaching out to reconnect, I‚Äôve been ignored a lot.  I would send a quick message and say I hope things are well or congrats on the marriage, job, kids, etc. and never hear back, even though it says they have seen it.

I just don‚Äôt get it.  You would think, even if I didn‚Äôt study with them or even know them as well, they would at least acknowledge it or say thanks.  I would think people of similar backgrounds or interests might want to spend a few minutes with it.  Likewise, I can‚Äôt think of me doing anything that would justify them going no contact.  I can only think of one time where I got upset at someone and told them to F off, before coming back a few minutes later and apologizing.  I know I shouldn‚Äôt have done that, but they must have pretty thin skin if that is the worst they have heard.

I know people are busy and have their own problems, but that excuse doesn‚Äôt impress me.  My life has been very easy compared to so many, but it still had its difficulties.  I‚Äôve worked full time since I was 22, and was in school or working part time since I was 18.  I‚Äôve struggled with OCD, migraines, job loss, work stress, school stress, rejection.  I grew up with loving parents, but money was often tight and this caused a lot of disagreement.  I think much of the issue was my dad had undiagnosed ADHD and dyslexia.  He lost his job after getting quite sick with Hep. C (back when chemo was the only treatment).  Thankfully, he got better.   My mom had breast cancer more recently, but thankfully it was caught early and treated.  Sorry if that was a bit of a rant, but it felt good getting it out.  And I should mention that I have never told anyone of those things, so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm trying to dump that on them.

But despite that, I still make time for people.  I would still get back to someone who reached out to me, even if it is just a sentence.  Sometimes I did it out of feeling interested.  Other times, it was out of politeness.

I feel like there are only two reasons that it could be:

1.  I come off as overly friendly.  Sometimes I might get a bit overly enthusiastic about talking with people.  I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve often been shy in life, so feeling I can reach out to someone, and having the courage to do so can be somewhat exhilarating.  That and I like to inject a bit of passion into life.

2.  Sexuality.  Recently, I‚Äôve come to the acceptance that I am at least bi-curious if not bi.  This was a tough road filled with confusion, anger, shame.  I still haven‚Äôt told anyone yet.  I never asked any one of these people out on a date, nor did I ever make any sexual advance or even joke.  The only thing I can think of is if I subconsciously displayed some more feminine traits at times, and they falsely thought I was asking them out if I said let‚Äôs hang out, grab a coffee, go to a party, etc.  I had no romantic interest in them.  And even if I was gay, I think it‚Äôs pretty bad to assume that every conversation I have is intended only for sex and that I am incapable of friendships.  

So, what do you think it is?  Should I take a more neutral approach to people, or is it just that some people don‚Äôt how else to say no?  Or am I just dealing with assholes?",1,1734725880.0,AskMen,3,0.6,False

1hisox7,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1hisox7/is_it_possible_she_liked_me/,Is it possible she liked me?,"Hi,

I have a experience/question for you . I will describe my situation with one woman. It's a long post so thank you for reading.

Anyway,  there is a woman (straight and has a boyfriend and 11 years older than me) at my work with whom I kinda instantly clicked. I'm bi but closeted, and I would bet my life she is also(I can't go into specific details about her and why I think that, who knows who lurks what subreddit)

Whenever we got into normal conversation or worked together on a project, things were very natural and smooth and she thinks I'm funny and laughs to my jokes etc. So i got the impression she likes or liked me.

I will describe some situstions, there are many more, but I think this will be enough from top of my head. 

She engaged first contact and was always looking at me and basically showing interest in me.

We started comunicating more and one time I came to her and made a joke: ""like, you must be happy to see me"" and she looked me dead in the eyes and said with soft voice ""I'm always happy when I see you"".

Also, she would always bitting her lips when we were talking and looking at me.

Then, we went to a coffee at work and I was petting the dog and she came from behind me and stroked my hair and proceeded to my back. As we were walking to get the coffee I said that i just wanted some one on one time with her and she smiled and asked if I was gonna hit on her which is a really strange question for someone who has boyfriend and is straight and also a coworker..

After that we were kinda going back and forth and I noticed that she can't look me in the eyes and in a way avoids me but at the same time is happy to see me.

I always caught her looking at me whenever she saw me and when I looked at her direction she quickly turned her head the other way.

I don't know how to describe this but it's like at the same time she was interested and wanted to be close but also like runnin from me.

Now, at the time I already fell for her but I wasn't showing it. I decided to kinda step back, I wasn't messaging her, just say hi when I saw her.  It continued to be like i described, constant looking from her side.

Then, one day I was talking with another colleague about my new car and she saw me, smiled and said ""oh finally I only see you in the hallways"".

And it continued to be like this back and forth for the rest of the year but with good comunication at work and messaging here and there. 
When I came to the office(at that period she was on my floor with my team) she wouldn't say hi.
But again looking at me and listening everything I was talking about. When i was talking with someone on the hallway she would always pay attention also.
But, when she saw me she couldn't look me in the eye. 
Also, i came once to the office and was talking with another colleague about a project, she listened carefully the whole time and said ""well you obviously explained that good to the client"". 

Then one day we were talking and I said that I was driving really fast. She begin yelling at me instantly like are you insane you will kill yourself and so on... my other colleagues never got that kind of reaction and when i told them about hers they were like wtf.

So basically she got worried that I would end up dead in an accident. 

To repeat, none other colleagues, male or female didn't have that reaction or was that worried.

At one party, she also told me that i smoke too much(after watching me constantly). Why if we are basically nothing? Other colleagues never commented something like that. 

Also, before that sentence, when I approached my colleague who was sitting next to her she looked down and got nervous. 

When I started talking to him, she looked at me and listened very carefully (she was like 30 cm from my face bacause  ihad to lean forward because of the music and it was really a starring like before, not just like when you listen someone in conversation).

Again I mentioned my fast driving ( i had another car while my was at repair) and said like it goes fast as well. She was again mad and said yeah I bet it does.

I decided to distance myself from her bacause at the time I was very confused and i thought that I was crazy and it's all in my head(probably was).

I bought new lego and my package arrived at reception. She went by and stopped and asked ""oo you buyed a new one"" and proceed to look at it while i answered only yes (this is me distancing lol).

Then, again this constant looking/no looking until another party.
She asked me how it's going and i said look i distanced myself i don't wanna be in your way and she was like surprised and i moved to another spot.

Later we met again and had a talk and i confronted her and said that i'm not stupid and I see that she basically avoiding me.

She replied that she has her group of people at work and she is like on hi with everyone else also(not true). She seemed agitated while responding.
Then she told me that this doesn't mean that she has a bad opinion about me it is actually the opposite and while telling me this she again look down, couldn't look me in the eyes.

Also she was like ""you didn't show/send me a picture of lego"". And I showed her and she snatched my phone to take a closer look and brushed my hand while doing so.

After that I decided to distance myself even further and stopped communicating entirely. I basically told myself I'm an idiot for thinking she likes me and I got it all wrong.

Situation was the same, looking at me but when I come close can't look me in the eyes and like runnin but also showing interes.

After she got back from vacation I continued to ignored her and she was looking at me(not just glance, prolonged looking like scanning almost)

One day I held a door for my colleague and she was behind him but someone called her so she went 2 steps back but when she saw I was holding the door she rushed towards and said thank you as if I was holding it for her and then she got back to that person calling her.  

She very obviously used this situation to come closer to me and this little ""interaction"" was the first one after a couple of months.

Then there was another party which I didn't attend but we got like appreciation from our colleagues for work. 
I got one and she texted me saying something along the lines you got it, well deserved! 

And this damn text got me both mad, happy and confused and I got right back to the start and also overthinking.

But to be honest I don't hold any hopes and I'm doing better every day getting over this stupidity of my.

We communicate alright here and then and say hi. Also, I gotta be careful because we are at work so I'm trying to get a right mix of ignoring and engaging with her.

She still looks at me, deep prolonged look that I always catch and then sudden head turning. 
When passing by me still can't look me in the eyes...

But I don't care anymore.

My only question is was I really that stupid and got the wrong impression cause maybe she was just polite or is simply easygoing and I somehow thought ooh, a woman likes me or based on what i described, she likes me(or did like me) and it scared her and that is why she acts hot/cold?

I just hope I learned something from this situation.",0,1734725811.0,LesbianActually,3,0.33,False

I‚Äôve noticed this feeling seems to happen when I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed or stressed, which is unusual for me.

But he shoveled the walkway and his back was sore, so instead he wanted to rest until it was time to go, then grab the wine, and go straight to the party. 

And honestly I was devastated, and I don't know why. It's not like we both agreed to my plan and then he changed his mind - he just didn't want to do things that way when I brought it up, and for a perfectly valid reason. Everything on the to-do list still gets done. The only material change is I have to wait a little longer for my coffee treat. Yet I was hurt, and disappointed, and angry, and I couldn't push it aside or pretend that I was okay. I was literally going through the stages of grief but in hyperspeed.

From my knowledge, routine/expectation interruption is more a problem for people with autism, which I have not been diagnosed with. I wonder about it a lot though, and this is only making me question it more.

The problem ‚Äî how do we clean the water reservoir? theres no instructions for that in the manual. Should we just run a brew cycle with soapy water, or vinegar water? Any advice? We haven't turned it on or tried the machine yet.
Honestly any advice would be helpful as I've never used a home espresso machine before, especially one this old. Its only missing the drip tray and the steam wand is in a rather odd shape.
