Some nights, he still woke reaching for her—fumbling blindly through the darkness for a hand that would never be there again. Grief, he realized, had a smell: old clothes, cold sheets, unopened mail.

Just before Anna’s passing, the twins had been born—tiny, furious fists clenching at the air. Every new day with them had felt like a second chance. Emma, with her mother's green eyes and fierce little laugh. Samuel, quieter, thoughtful even as an infant, furrowing his brow like he was trying to solve the world's problems.

They filled the house with life again. Noise. Color. Robert cooked terrible pancakes every Sunday—Emma demanding extra syrup, Samuel meticulously sorting his blueberries before eating. He read to them every night, even when they fell asleep halfway through. They built snowmen with mittened hands in the winter, fed ducks at the pond in spring, ran barefoot through sprinklers under the sticky heat of summer.

And every night, after the giggles and the mess and the exhaustion, Robert kissed their foreheads and whispered the same thing: ""I will always protect you.""

He meant it.

That November afternoon was gray and damp, the misty rain making the world look like it was dissolving at the edges. Emma wanted a pumpkin ""big enough to sit inside,"" while Samuel had chosen one lopsided and scarred, insisting it had ""character."" Robert strapped them into their booster seats, singing along with the radio, the car filled with syrupy, sticky laughter.

The semi-truck came out of nowhere. One moment: headlights. The next: twisting metal. Then—silence.

When Robert came to, hanging upside down from his seatbelt, the only sound was the soft hiss of the ruined engine. He screamed for them. Clawed at the wreckage. Dragged himself, bleeding and broken, toward the back. Emma and Samuel were gone. Still buckled in, so small, so still.

At the funeral, Robert stood between two tiny white caskets, staring as faces blurred around him and words tumbled into meaningless noise.

""God has a plan."" ""They're angels now."" ""Time heals.""

Time, Robert thought numbly, had already taken everything.

That night, alone in the nursery, clutching a sock no bigger than his thumb, he whispered the only prayer left to him: ""Bring them back.""

No one answered.

# Chapter 2: Hollow Men

The days after the funeral blurred together, each one a paler copy of the last. Robert woke at dawn, not because he wanted to, but because the house demanded it—cruel reminders of a life that no longer existed. Samuel’s alarm still chirped at seven a.m., a tiny little jingle that once made Samuel giggle under the covers. Robert couldn’t bring himself to turn it off. He brewed coffee he didn’t drink, packed lunches no one would eat, reached for tiny jackets that would never again be worn. Every movement ended the same way: with the silence pressing in like water in a sinking room.

He tried to hold the pieces together at first. Sat stiffly in grief counseling groups while strangers passed sorrow back and forth like trading cards. He nodded at the talk of “stages,” “healing,” “coping,” while his chest felt like it was filling with wet cement. He adopted a dog—a golden retriever named Daisy. The shelter said she was “good with kids.” Robert brought her home, hoping maybe something would spark again. But Daisy only whined at the door, as if she, too, was waiting for children who would never come home. Three days later, he returned her. The woman at the shelter didn’t ask why.

By spring, the house was immaculate, sterile—as if polished grief could make it livable again. The nursery remained untouched. The firetruck sat mid-rescue on the rug. A doll lay half-tucked beneath a tiny pillow, eternally ready for sleep. Sometimes Robert thought he heard them laughing upstairs, voices soft and wild and real as breath. Sometimes, he answered back.

Outside, the world moved on. Children shrieked with joy in parks. Mothers chased toddlers through grocery aisles. Fathers hoisted giggling kids onto their shoulders at county fairs. At first, Robert turned away from these scenes, flinching like they were gunshots. But soon, he began to watch. He stood in the shadows of the elementary school parking lot, leaning against his rusted truck, staring at the children spilling through the doors—backpacks bouncing, shoes untied, voices lifted in a chorus of lives untouched by loss.

""Why them?"" he thought. ""Why not mine?""

The resentment crept in like mold beneath the wallpaper—quiet, patient, inevitable.

One evening, he sat alone in the dim light of the living room. An untouched bottle of whiskey sat on the table, sweating with condensation. The television flickered with cartoons—a plastic family around a plastic dinner table, all laughter and pastel perfection. Robert stared at the screen. Then, without warning, he hurled the remote across the room. It shattered against the wall, leaving a long, ugly crack.

His chest heaved with silent, shaking sobs. Not for Anna. Not even for Emma and Samuel. But for himself. For the man he used to be. For the father he failed to stay.

The next morning, without planning to, Robert drove to the school lot before dawn. The world was still dark, the pavement damp with night. A bright blue minivan caught his eye—plastered with “Proud Parent” stickers and stick-figure decals of smiling children, their parents, and two dogs. Robert knelt beside it, the pocketknife flashing briefly in the dim light. He peeled the tiny stick-figure children from the back window, one by one. Then he slashed the tire, slow and steady, the blade whispering through rubber like breath.

When the mother discovered the damage hours later—cursing, frantic, dragging her children into another car—Robert smiled for the first time in months. A small, broken thing. It didn’t fix anything. It didn’t bring Emma and Samuel back. But it shifted the weight in his chest—just enough for him to breathe.

That night, he dreamed of them. Emma laughing, Samuel running barefoot through the grass, fireflies sparking in the gold-washed twilight. He woke to silence, the dream already fading. But something else stirred beneath the grief.

A flicker.

Control.

# Chapter 3: Seeds of Malice

The second time, it wasn’t enough to slash a tire. Robert needed them to feel it. Not just the inconvenience, not just the momentary panic. He needed them to understand that joy was a fragile, a borrowed thing—one that could be ripped away just as suddenly as it was given. Like his had been.

At dusk, the school parking lot stood silent, the last child long since swept up in a waiting minivan. Robert moved through the rows of bicycles like a man walking among gravestones. Each one upright. Untouched. Proud. He slipped a box cutter from his coat pocket. The first brake cable sliced with almost no resistance. Then another. Then another. He moved methodically—his grief becoming surgical.

The next morning, from the privacy of his truck, Robert watched a boy coast down a hill—fast, laughing, light. And then the bike didn’t stop. The child’s face turned. Laughter crumpled into terror. He crashed hard, metal meeting bone. A broken wrist. Blood in his mouth. Screams.

Parents swarmed like bees kicked from a hive, their voices panicked, their eyes wide. Robert didn’t move. He watched it all with hands trembling faintly in his lap.

He thought it would be enough.

But two weeks later, the boy returned. Cast on his arm. A gap where his front teeth had been. And he was laughing again. Like nothing had changed.

Robert’s jaw clenched until it hurt. They hadn’t learned. They had already begun to forget.

The annual Harvest Festival arrived in a blur of orange booths and plastic spiderwebs, cotton candy, and hay bales. Children raced from game to game, cheeks flushed from the cold, arms swinging bags of prizes. He moved through the maze like a ghost. No one looked twice at the man with the hood pulled low. Why would they?

Children leaned over tubs of apples, dunking their heads, emerging with triumphant smiles. Emma would have loved this. She would have squealed with laughter, water dripping from her curls, cheeks red from the chill.

His hands shook as he slipped the crushed glass into the tub. Ground fine—but not invisible. Sharp enough. Just sharp enough. He lingered nearby, heart pounding like a drum inside his ribs.

The first scream cut through the carnival like lightning. A boy stumbled back from the tub, blood streaming from his mouth, his cry high and broken. More screams followed. Mothers pulled their children close. Booths tipped. Lights flickered. The festival collapsed into chaos.

Still—not enough.

Robert returned home and sat in the nursery. The crib was cold. The racecar bed untouched. The silence as thick as syrup. He sat on the hardwood floor, knees to his chest, and whispered:

""They don’t remember you.""

His voice cracked. Not from rage. But from emptiness.

The playground came next. The place they had loved the most.

At three in the morning, Robert crept across the dewy grass, fog clinging low, as if the world were trying to hide what he was becoming. He wore gloves. Moved like a man fixing something broken. He loosened the bolts on the swings just enough that the nuts would fall after a few good pushes. He smeared grease across the rungs of the slide. Buried broken glass beneath the innocent softness of the sandbox. Then he left.

The next day, he parked nearby, watching as the playground filled with children again. The laughter returned so easily, as if it had never left.

Then came the fall.

A boy—maybe six—slipped from the monkey bars and struck his head on the edge of the platform. Blood pooled in the dirt. His mother’s scream sounded like something being torn in half. An ambulance arrived. The playground emptied.

Robert sat in his truck and felt that same flicker in his chest. Not joy. Not peace.

But control.

For a moment, he wasn’t the man who had clutched a tiny sock and begged God to make a trade. He was the one who turned the screws. The one who made the world bend.

He didn’t stop.

# Chapter 4: The Gentle Push

The river ran like an old scar along the edge of Halston, swollen and restless after weeks of rain. Robert stood alone at the water’s edge, the damp earth sucking at his boots, the air cold enough to bite through his coat. Across the park, families moved like faint shadows in the fog, children darting between the trees, their laughter muted and distant, like memories worn thin by time.

He watched them without blinking.

He watched him.

A small boy, maybe five or six years old, wandered away from the others, rain boots slapping through shallow puddles, his coat slipping off one shoulder. Robert saw how easily it happened—the gap between a parent's distracted glance, the careless joy of a child unaware of how quickly the world could take everything from him.

Robert moved without thinking. Not planning. Not deciding. Just following the pull inside him, a pull shaped by loss and stitched together with rage.

He crossed the grass in slow, steady strides, boots silent against the wet earth. When he reached the boy, he didn't say a word. He simply placed a hand on the child's small back—a touch as light as breath, the kind of touch a father might give to steady his son, to guide him back to safety.

But this time, there was no safety.

The boy stumbled forward. The slick ground gave way beneath his boots. His arms flailed once, a startled gasp escaping his mouth, and then the river took him.

No thrashing. No screaming. Just the slow, cold pull of the current swallowing him whole.

Robert turned away before the first cries rang out. He walked into the trees, his breath misting in the frigid air, his hands curling into fists inside his sleeves. Behind him, screams split the fog, voices shattered the quiet—parents running, wading into the water too late.

He didn’t stop. He didn’t look back.

That night, Robert sat cross-legged between Emma’s crib and Samuel’s racecar bed. The nursery smelled of dust and faded dreams. He placed his hands in his lap, palms open like a man offering an apology no one would ever hear, and he whispered into the hollow silence:

""I made it fair.""

The words tasted like ash on his tongue.

For the first time in months, he slept through the night, deep and dreamless.

But morning brought no peace.

By noon, the riverbank had transformed into a shrine. Flowers and stuffed animals lined the muddy ground. Notes written in childish handwriting flapped in the wind. Candles guttered against the damp air. Children stood holding hands, their faces pale with confusion as their parents clutched them tighter, their grief raw and noisy.

Robert drove past slowly, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. He watched them weep, saw their shoulders shake with the weight of a loss they couldn’t contain.

For a moment, he felt something close to satisfaction. A shifting of the scales.

But as he rounded the bend and the river disappeared from view, the satisfaction dissolved, leaving behind a familiar emptiness.

They would mourn today. Tomorrow, they would forget.

They always forget.

# Chapter 5: The Town Crumbles

Three days later, the boy’s body was pulled from the river, tangled in roots and mud, bloated from the cold. The coroner called it an accident. Drowning. A tragic slip. Everyone in Halston nodded and murmured and avoided each other’s eyes. But something changed.

The parks emptied. Sidewalks once buzzing with bikes and hopscotch now lay silent under cloudy skies. Parents walked their children to school in tight clumps, hands gripped a little too tightly, eyes flicking to every passing car. Playgrounds stood deserted beneath creaking swings and rusting chains. But it didn’t last.

A week passed. Then another. The fences around the park came down. Children returned—cautious at first, then louder, bolder. The shrieks of joy returned, diluted with only a trace of caution. The town, like it always did, began to forget.

Robert couldn’t stand it.

He returned to the scene of the first fall—Miller Park—under the cover of fog and early morning darkness. The playground had been repaired. New bolts gleamed beneath the swing seats. New paint shone on the monkey bars.

Robert smiled bitterly. Then he went to work.

He loosened the bolts again, not so much that they would fall immediately, but just enough to ensure failure. Enough to remind. Enough to reopen the wound.

That morning, a boy ran ahead of his mother, eager to swing higher, faster. Robert watched from his truck as the seat tore loose in mid-air, the boy thrown to the gravel below like a puppet with its strings cut. Another scream. Another ambulance. Another tiny victory. But it wasn’t enough.

One broken arm would never equal two coffins.

Thanksgiving loomed, brittle and joyless. Halston strung up lights, tried to bake its way back into comfort, but everything tasted like fear. Robert didn’t feel it soften. If anything, the ache in his chest had sharpened.

He found his next moment during a birthday party—balloons tied to fence posts, paper hats, children screaming with sugared laughter. Seven years old. The age Emma and Samuel would have been.

He watched from the alley behind the house, his jacket dusted with soot to match the disguise—just another utility worker. He didn’t need threats or blackmail this time. He didn’t need help.

Just a soft smile. A kind voice. A simple story about a missing puppy.

The little girl followed him willingly.

In the plastic playhouse near the edge of the yard, Robert tucked her gently beneath unopened presents. Her arms were folded neatly. Her hair smoothed back. He set Emma’s old music box beside her, its tune warped and gasping. It played three broken notes before clicking into silence.

She looked like she was sleeping.

By the time the party noticed she was missing, Robert was already miles away. He drove in silence, humming the lullaby softly under his breath, as if to soothe himself more than her.

But the hollow inside him didn’t shrink.

Winter came early that year. Snow blanketed the sidewalks. The playgrounds stayed empty now—not because of caution, but because of cold. Christmas lights blinked behind drawn curtains. People whispered more often than they spoke.

And still, the town tried to move forward.

Robert watched two boys skipping stones into the water where the river hadn’t yet frozen. They were brothers. They laughed without fear. Without consequence.

Samuel should have had a brother to skip stones with.

Robert crouched beside them. Smiled. Held out a daisy chain he had woven in the truck—white flowers strung together with trembling hands. The boys giggled and reached for it.

He guided them closer to the edge.

One soft push.

The river accepted them.

When their bodies were found seventeen days later, wrapped in each other’s arms beneath a frozen bend, the daisy chain had vanished. But Robert still saw it—looped around their wrists like a crown of thorns.

Elsewhere in town, Linda Moore sat in front of her computer. Her spreadsheet blinked. A child’s name—Eli Meyers—suddenly shifted rows. Not one she had touched. Not one she had assigned.

Beside the name, a new comment appeared: “He looks like Samuel did when he lost his first tooth.”

Then a new tab opened—her niece’s photo, taken from outside the school that morning. Through a window. Across glass.

The screen blinked red: “She still likes hide-and-seek, right?”

Linda’s hands hovered over the keys. She didn’t call anyone. She didn’t say anything. She just let the change stand.

That afternoon, Eli boarded the wrong van for a field trip. When the chaperones reached the botanical gardens, they came up one short. They retraced every step, called his name until their voices cracked. But Eli was gone.

The police found his backpack three days later, tucked under a hedge near the perimeter fence. Zipper closed. Lunch untouched. No struggle. No footprints. No sign of him at all.

Just silence.

The school shut down its field trip program. Metal detectors were installed the next week—secondhand machines that buzzed even when touched gently. Classroom doors were fitted with new locks. Parent volunteers were fingerprinted. A dusk curfew followed.

In a closed-door meeting, someone on the city council finally said it out loud:

“Sabotage.”

Maria Vance stood outside Halston Elementary the next morning. The sky was gray, the cold sharp enough to sting. Parents didn’t make eye contact. Teachers moved like ghosts. Children whispered like everything was a secret.

Maria didn’t need the pins on her map anymore. She could feel the pattern in her bones.

This wasn’t chaos.

This was design.

And whoever was behind it… they were just getting started.

# Chapter 6: Graves and Whispers

Another funeral. Another headline. Another casket lowered into the frozen ground while a town full of trembling hands tried to convince themselves that prayer could hold back death. Halston draped itself in mourning again, but the grief rang hollow. They weren’t mourning Robert’s children. They were mourning their own safety, their own illusions.

Still, life in Halston ground on. The grocery stores stayed open. The school bell still rang. The church choir resumed, voices cracking on and off-key. Robert watched it all from the outside, a man staring through glass at a world he no longer belonged to. Their fear wasn’t enough. Their tears weren't enough. They had forgotten Emma and Samuel.

So he decided to make them remember.

He found the perfect place: a crumbling church tucked into a forgotten bend of road, its steeple sagging like a broken finger pointed skyward. Once a place of baptisms and vows, now it stank of mildew and mouse droppings. Still, there was something fitting about it. Robert prepared carefully. He built a crude cross out of rotting pew backs. He scavenged candles from a thrift store bin. He smuggled in a battered cassette deck, loaded with a single song—""Safe in His Arms,"" warped and warbling with age.

He thought about Emma humming along to hymns in the backseat, Samuel tapping his feet without knowing the words. He thought about the empty nursery and the promises he had failed to keep.

The boy he chose wasn’t special. Just small. Just alone. Harold Knox, the school bus driver, had been warned months before. A photo of his daughter tucked inside his glovebox. A note in red marker: ""He will suffer. Or she will."" Nails delivered in a plain manila envelope.

On a cold Thursday morning, the bus paused at Pine Creek stop. Fog licked the ground like low smoke. One child stepped off. The doors hissed shut behind him. Robert was waiting in the trees.

The boy didn’t scream. He didn’t run. He simply blinked up at the man reaching out to him. Inside the ruined church, Robert worked quickly but carefully. The child was lifted onto the wooden cross, his back pressed to the splintering wood. Nails were driven through soft palms and tender feet. Not savagely—but deliberately, with grim reverence. Each strike of the hammer echoed through the empty rafters like the tolling of a slow funeral bell.

""You'll see them soon,"" Robert whispered as he drove the final nail home. ""My little ones are waiting.""

He placed a paper crown on the boy’s brow. Smeared a rough ash cross over the child's small chest. Lit six candles at the base of the altar. Then he pressed play. The hymn trickled through the cold, rotten air, warbling and distant. Robert stood for a long moment, his eyes stinging, before he turned and walked away. He locked the doors behind him, leaving the boy crucified beneath the broken arches.

It was the boy’s mother who found him. She had followed the music, though no one else had heard it. She had forced the heavy doors open and fallen to her knees at the sight. The boy was alive. Barely. But something essential in him—something fragile and bright—had been extinguished forever.

Halston did not rally around this tragedy. There were no vigils. No bake sales. No Facebook groups offering casseroles and prayers. They shut their church doors. Canceled choir practice. Turned their faces away from their own shame.

Maria Vance stood outside the ruined church, the rain soaking through her coat, her hair plastered to her forehead. She didn’t light a cigarette. Didn’t open her notepad. She just stared through the doorway at the altar, at the boy nailed to the cross, at the candles sputtering against the wet wind.

This wasn’t revenge anymore. It wasn’t even grief. This was ritual.

That night, Maria tore everything off the walls of her office. Maps, photographs, reports—all of it came down. She started over with red string and thumbtacks, tracing each death, each disappearance, each shattered life. And when she stepped back, she saw it for what it was: a spiral.

Not random chaos. Not accidents. A wound closing in on itself.

At its center: silence. No fingerprints. No footprints. No smoking gun. Just grief. And grief was spreading like infection.

Parents pulled their children out of school. The Christmas pageant was canceled. The playgrounds sat under gathering drifts of snow, swings frozen mid-sway. Stores boarded their windows after dark. Halston was curling inward, shrinking, dying a little more each day.

And somewhere, Maria knew, the hand behind all of it was still moving.

She didn’t have proof. Not yet. But she could feel it in her bones.

This wasn’t over. Not even close.

Late that night, staring at her empty wall, Maria whispered to the darkness: ""I’m coming for you.""

And somewhere out in the dead heart of Halston, something whispered back.

# Chapter 7: The Spider’s Web

The sketchbook was found by accident, jammed between a stack of overdue returns at the Halston Public Library. A volunteer almost tossed it into the donation bin without looking. Curiosity saved it—and maybe saved lives.

At first glance, it looked like any child's notebook. Tattered corners. Smudges of dirt. But inside, Maria Vance saw what others might have missed. She flipped through the pages with gloved hands, her stomach tightening with every turn.

Children, sketched in trembling pencil lines, filled the pages. Their faces twisted in terror. Scenes of drowning, of falling, of burning playgrounds and broken swings. Some pages had dates scrawled in the margins—events that had already happened. Others bore dates that hadn’t yet arrived.

Mixed among the drawings were music notes, faint staves from hymns, each line annotated with uneven, obsessive care. On one page, three candles formed a triangle, familiar from the church scene. On another, a child's chest bore the ash cross Robert had smeared. It was all there—mapped in quiet, meticulous horror.

One line, scrawled over and over in the margins, stopped Maria cold: ""I don’t want them to suffer. I want them to remember. To feel it. To see them. Emma liked daisies. Samuel hated swings. They laughed on rainy days. Please. Remember.""

She pressed her hand to her mouth, her eyes stinging. This wasn’t just violence. This was love—twisted, broken love, weaponized into something unrecognizable.

At the bottom of many pages, a code repeated again and again: 19.73.14.8.21

It wasn’t a phone number. It wasn’t coordinates. It wasn’t a date. Maria stayed up all night breaking it down. Old habits from cold cases surfaced—simple alphanumeric cipher: A=1, B=2, and so on.

S.M.H.H.U.

Nonsense, until she cross-referenced abandoned businesses in Halston's property records.

Samuel’s Mobile Home Hardware Utility. A tiny repair shop that had shuttered years ago, its letters still ghosting across a sagging storefront.

The lease belonged to a man who had never made the papers until now: Robert Hayes.

No criminal record. No complaints. No outstanding bills. His name surfaced once, buried in an old laptop repair registration. The name Anna Hayes appeared alongside his. Deceased. Along with two children: Emma and Samuel. A car crash, two years prior.

Maria’s pulse pounded in her ears. She pulled the warrant herself. No backup. No news vans. Just her badge and a city-issued key.

The house at the end of Chestnut Lane looked abandoned. The windows were boarded. Weeds clawed their way up the front steps. But inside, the air smelled like grief had been embalmed into the walls.

She moved slowly, her footsteps muffled against the dust. The kitchen was stripped bare. The living room was hollowed out, the couch gone, the tables missing. Only the nursery remained untouched.

Two beds—one tiny racecar frame, one white-painted crib. Tiny shoes lined up neatly against the wall. Crayon drawings taped with careful hands: Emma holding a daisy. Samuel clutching a paper star.

Maria’s throat tightened. She knelt by the crib and saw it— A loose floorboard, cut precisely.

Underneath, she found a panel. And beneath the panel: photographs.

Hundreds of them.

Children on swings. Children walking home from school. A girl climbing the jungle gym. A boy waiting at a crosswalk. Her own niece, captured through the glass of a cafeteria window. Even herself—photographed at her office window, late at night, unaware.

On the back of her photo, in red marker, someone had scrawled: ""Even the strong lose their children.""

Maria staggered back, the room tilting. Robert hadn’t been lashing out blindly. He had been orchestrating this, piece by piece, grief by grief.

He had built a web.

And now she was standing at its center.

# Chapter 8: The Broken Father

They found him at an abandoned grain silo just outside Halston, a skeleton of rust and rotted beams forgotten by progress. The frost clung to the metal, and the morning mist wrapped around the place like a shroud.

Inside, twenty children sat in a wide circle, drowsy, confused, but alive. Their hands were zip-tied loosely in front of them—no bruises, no screaming. Only a heavy, drugged stillness. The air smelled of damp hay, gasoline, and old metal. Makeshift wiring coiled around the support beams, tangled like veins. Propane tanks sat beneath them, linked by a taut, quivering wire.

At the center stood Robert Hayes.

He was barefoot, his clothes coated in dust and ash, his hair hanging in ragged tufts over his eyes. In one hand, he clutched a worn photograph—Emma dressed in an orange pumpkin costume, Samuel wearing a ghost sheet too big for him, chocolate smeared across his chin. The picture was bent, the edges soft from being touched too often.

In his other hand: the detonator.

Maria Vance pushed past the barricades before anyone could stop her. She left her gun holstered. She left the shouting negotiators behind. She moved through the broken doorway into the silo’s yawning cold, stepping carefully as if entering a church.

Robert didn’t look at her at first. His thumb brushed across Samuel’s face in the photo, tender and trembling. When he finally raised his eyes, they were dark hollows rimmed with exhaustion—not anger. Not even madness.

Just grief.

""They laugh,"" Robert whispered, his voice rough, shredded from disuse. ""They still dance. They pretend it didn’t happen.""

Maria stopped a few feet away, close enough to see the scars time had carved into him, the way his shoulders sagged under invisible weights.

""They didn’t forget your children,"" she said softly. ""They forgot how to show it.""

Robert’s lip trembled. His grip on the photograph tightened.

""Emma loved the rain,"" he said, as if to himself. ""Samuel... he hummed when he drew. No one remembers that.""

""I do,"" Maria said.

The words cracked something inside him. His arms slackened. His body seemed to shrink. He looked down at the children—their heads drooping in the cold—and then, finally, he let the switch fall. It hit the dirt with a soft, hollow thud.

Robert Hayes sank to his knees, folding into himself like a man kneeling at an altar. The officers moved in then—slowly, carefully. No shouting. No violence. They cuffed him gently, almost reverently, as if recognizing they were not capturing a monster, but burying a broken father.

As they led him past Maria, he turned his head slightly. His voice, when it came, was low enough that only she could hear.

""I killed most of them,"" he said.

Not all. Most.

The word cut deeper than any weapon.

Robert hadn’t acted alone.

And Halston’s nightmare was far from over.

# Chapter 9: Broken Threads

Two weeks after Robert Hayes was locked behind steel bars, another child died.

A girl this time. Found floating face down in a retention pond behind Halston Middle School. Her sneakers were placed neatly beside her backpack, the zipper closed, her lunch still inside untouched. There were no signs of a struggle. No bruises. No cries for help. Just the stillness of the water swallowing another small life.

Maria Vance stood in the rain at the pond’s edge, her hands balled into fists in her coat pockets. She watched as divers hauled the girl’s body out under a gray, broken sky. Every instinct in her screamed against the easy explanation being whispered around her: accident. Tragedy. Bad luck.

But Maria knew better.

Robert Hayes was sealed away, his world reduced to a cell barely wide enough to stretch his arms. No visitors. No phone calls. No letters. And still—the dying continued.

Someone else was carrying the flame now.

She returned to her office late that night and faced the wall of photographs and maps. Not as a detective. Not even as a protector. As a mourner. Someone who had lost, and who understood the ache that demanded action, no matter the cost.

This wasn’t about Robert anymore. It was about everyone he had touched.

She didn’t trace the victims this time. She traced the helpers.

The janitor who had locked the wrong fire exit during the Christmas pageant. The administrator who had quietly reassigned field trip groups. The bus driver who had closed the doors before the last child could climb aboard.

Ordinary people. Invisible hands.

Maria started digging.

Brian Teller cracked first. She approached him without backup, without even her badge displayed. Just a quiet conversation at his kitchen table. She asked about the fire door. His fingers trembled around his coffee cup. She asked about the night of the pageant. He looked away.

Then she mentioned his son. The boy with asthma.

Brian broke like a rotted beam.

""They sent me a photo,"" he whispered. ""It showed a red circle around his chest... around his lungs.""

He thought it was a prank at first. A cruel joke. He hadn’t meant for anyone to get hurt. But Robert had known exactly where to cut.

Linda Moore came next. She was waiting in the empty school office when Maria arrived, staring blankly at the playground beyond the frosted windows.

""I didn’t want anyone to die,"" Linda said before Maria could even speak. ""They sent me a picture of my niece. Sleeping. In her bed. I just... I thought if I moved a name, it would be harmless.""

Harold Knox—the bus driver—took the longest. He didn’t speak at all when Maria placed the envelope on the table between them. The photos. The nails. The hymn sheet with the red slash across it.

His hands shook. His shoulders sagged.

""I thought it would end,"" he said finally. ""I thought if I did what they asked, it would be over.""

Maria said nothing. She didn’t need to. Because she understood something that terrified her.

Robert Hayes hadn’t needed to kill with his own hands.

He had taught grief how to move from person to person, like a contagion. He had taught fear how to whisper in the ears of desperate mothers, exhausted fathers, terrified guardians. He had taught ordinary people to become monsters in the name of love.

That night, Maria rebuilt her board one last time.

Not a network of victims. But of mourners. Of conspirators. Of grief-stricken souls trapped between guilt and survival.

She traced red string from each accomplice, not to Robert, but to the acts they committed—small acts, each just a hair’s breadth from excusable, from forgivable, until they weren’t.

At the center of the new web wasn’t a man anymore. It was a wound.

Robert Hayes had planted something that would not die with him. It had learned to spread.

It had learned to live.

And it was still growing.

# Chapter 10: Ashes in the Wind

Robert Hayes was gone—a hollow man locked away behind glass and concrete, his name recorded in a courthouse ledger no one cared to read twice. His trial was short, his sentencing swift. Life without parole. No outbursts. No apologies.

And yet, Halston didn’t recover.

The news cameras packed up and left. The vigil candles guttered and drowned in rain. The teddy bears and faded flowers piled at playground fences decayed beneath early snows. A few hollow speeches were made about resilience, about healing, about moving forward.

But fear had taken root deeper than grief ever could.

Children walked to school two by two, their hands clenched white-knuckled. Parents trailed behind them, glancing over their shoulders at every rustle of leaves, every parked car. Churches stayed half-empty, pews gathering dust. Christmas decorations blinked dimly behind barred windows. Laughter, when it came, sounded thin and brittle.

Maria Vance saw it everywhere. In the way playgrounds sat deserted even on sunny days. In the way neighbors no longer trusted each other with their children. In the way hope had been packed away with the last of the holiday lights, perhaps forever.

And still, the messages came.

No more crude threats. No more photographs. Just notes now—typed, anonymous, slipped under doors or taped to mailbox flags. Simple messages.

""We’re still here."" ""She still dreams of water, doesn’t she?"" ""You can’t save them all.""

Maria sat alone most evenings at Miller Park, sipping cold coffee as the swings moved listlessly in the wind. She watched a rusted carousel creak in slow, aching turns. She watched the ghost of what Halston used to be.

And she understood, bitterly, that Robert Hayes had won something no prison walls could take away. He had planted fear not in the hearts of individuals, but in the soil of the town itself. It bloomed every day, fed by memory and absence.

He had turned grief into a weapon. And he had taught others how to wield it.

Halston wore its fear like an old, threadbare coat now—something familiar and heavy and impossible to shed.

Maria kept working. She kept pulling at threads, reopening old files, retracing old paths. She chased shadows. She chased half-remembered names. She chased whispers of whispers, knowing most of it would never lead anywhere clean.

Because Robert hadn’t needed to give orders anymore.

He had shown them how.

How to wound without touching. How to kill without a sound. How to turn love itself into a noose.

Maria walked the town at night sometimes, past shuttered shops, past homes with blacked-out windows, past a burned tool shed someone had once set ablaze just because it “looked wrong.” Every porch light flickering behind a curtain. Every father standing a little too long at the window after putting his children to bed. Every mother who locked every door twice, even during the day.

This was the new Halston.

Not a place. A wound.

The final note came on a Tuesday morning. No envelope. Just a sheet of paper taped to Maria’s front door, the words typed carefully, the ink barely dry.

""You can’t save them all.""

Maria stood barefoot on the porch, the snow biting up through her skin, and stared at the note until the cold seeped into her bones. Then she struck a match, holding it to the paper until it curled black and drifted apart into the wind.

Ashes in the snow.

She watched the last of it vanish into the pale morning light.

And whispered to the empty, listening town:

""Maybe not. But I can damn well try.""",1,1750104649.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1.The Stewart family spent their second week stuck in suburbia while princess Layla crammed in 37 hours of DVD instruction, 289 worksheets and Carlin waited on a cap and gown to be delivered from Amazon so they could exclaim that Kindergarten is done and put this whole painful “school” mess to bed.  While Layla was stuck in front of a screen, her parents decided to make a reel guessing the gender of their unborn baby.  They don’t speak at all in this one, and you might think that would make it slightly more bearable… but no, these 2 are just as embarrassing when they don’t speak.  Carlin is in an evening gown for some reason, and Evan is in a t-shirt and they have over a thousand comments from folks who are coming out of their skin to know the gender, and hoping it’s a girl.  Teasing the announcement is paying off so don’t expect an announcement any time soon.  Carlin forces Zade to sit on her bathroom counter while she gets dressed and show off his newest trick… after asking the usual “are you excited”, “are you happy”, “are you surprised” questions… she gets Zade to say “I love baby”… it’s a very long IIIIIII and Carlin is excited to praise him for using I instead of “me”.  I’m crossing my fingers that this is a tiny sign that the kid is still in speech class.  Carlin is off to film content for a few hours at the shop, but she hurries back home to film yet another ad with Zade.  Layla doesn’t have much time to film this week because girlfriend is still stuck in the corner cramming in K5.  This is an ad for the gummy vitamins all of the influencers are feeding their kids and Carlin serves it with cold cut up hot dogs and some fruit that Zade doesn’t touch.  He’s back to “me this” and “me that” and begs her to hold him.  She says her kids refuse to eat fruits and vegetables… it’s only because they don’t really serve those in a brown paper bag at a drive thru.  Later she encroaches on Layla’s privacy yet again by filming her asleep in a chair, in her princess gown, in her bedroom. Of course she links everything, all day, right down to the clothes hanger in Layla’s room.  Once Layla wakes up from her Abeka induced slumber, they head off to a carpet store where Zade wallows all over the floor until Carlin picks him up and Layla is in a tutu. These kids are 5 ½ and 3 ½, but who would ever know it?  Finally the last DVD in the bottom of the cardboard box of education is finished and Layla can slip on her fake cap and gown and twirl around in the dining room while mommy films it all and uses AI to explain how proud they are of her and how the future is hers… as long as it religiously and politically aligns with their values.  They interview Layla on this monumental occasion and guess what?  She can’t even pronounce graduation… that’s probably a 3rd grade skill, so no worries.  Layla says they are heading to the beach with friends to celebrate, and dances away to the Taylor Swift song Carlin has playing.  The weekly vlog is filmed mostly at home, except when they head to Carlin’s glucose test and checkup.  Evan has no memory of participating in this event in the past, and thinks he wasn’t even there for it.  They close their eyes so they don’t find out the gender, and then head home where Warden is busy turning their crawl space into a children’s nook.  It’s giving Harry Potter’s room under the stairs and feels creepy as heck.  There’s zero ventilation in this space and it reminds me of the prayer closet at the Plath house (diversion to a different creepy fundie family, sorry).  Anyway, they have also changed the couch covers on their $20,000 LoveSac couch that happens to be sponsoring this vlog.  Evan also added a surround sound package to the couch so now Disney Soundtracks can blast out of his azz and he seems thrilled.  They are also getting all new carpet upstairs even though Evan didn’t think it was necessary because they may “move soon if we have more kids”.  As if there is a question about that.  The big news is that they are installing a fence around the pool.  They don’t mention the elephant in the room, which is the tragedy in Arizona that made national news when an influencer’s son drowned recently, but Evan says they had to really think about this and it had to be one that he “really liked”.  They are super excited about this one because it’s REMOVABLE so they can take it down in “the winter or when we are having a party”.  It is so obvious that they really didn’t want the fence.  Anyway, they have it and now they can get back to filming in their fun park backyard without everyone slamming them in the comments.  Carlin mentions the locks on the doors, the camera and the alarm that they have… all are things the Arizona family had as well.  Later Carlin makes a reel using the footage from the doctor visit and they both act like absolute clowns in the doctor’s office.  Evan films Carlin being weighed and they share it… 146 if you were wondering.  These fundie men find new ways every week to be passive aggressive.
 
 
 
 
2.Hailey Clark is the only working member of the Clark family these days.  While at the Jersey Shore, she has to be subjected to being painted up like a mermaid and filmed from every angle because momma needs some content.  Apparently, there is a salon that does this, sort of like the Disney salon, and the entire Clark crew watches as Hailey is painted, sprayed and has her hair done for a mermaid themed photo shoot.  The reel has one million likes, over a quarter of a million shares and Katie refers to her as a “28 month old”… anything to keep her little.  Katie shares a grid post of beach pictures and continues to talk about her children being best friends and so very close, as if this is something remarkable and unique to only them. She spent most of the trip doing jigsaw puzzles and we see Daddy Clark teasing her about being bad at puzzles and Katie calling him a liar over and over.  He likes to get right in her face when he talks and I wish she would pop him one good time.  Interestingly enough, Katie isn’t sharing much these days unless it is an ad for a paid partnership.  Most of her content is canned, and she seems to being shot from the waist up only… Anyway, the weekly vlog shows them still at the beach where the Clark clan gathers for a cookout.  Travis says there are about 30 family members there.  His sister finally goes in to labor, and they drive from Jersey to Delaware to see her at the hospital.  Travis, the mastermind of this operation, follows GPS right on to a…. ferry.  It’s more than an hour out of their way, and he has a wife who gets severe motion sickness… but they don’t leave.  Instead, they hang out until the ferry leaves, and Katie loads up on Dramamine.  She tells the camera that she is definitely sick and Travis will have to stop filming.  His sister has the baby on June 11 and they head back home after spending 2 weeks with his family.  He says it’s the longest they have spent since moving to Tennessee.  
 
 
 
 
3.The Balka clan is finally home from Hawaii and that means Josie is back for more airplane content.  She films herself on the red-eye doing skin care and putting on a face mask and the pool noodle.  She links everything and the comments are not kind.  She has lots of folks asking why the heck she is doing all of this just to go home, why she is doing this in public, and why she is so damn vain.  Later they experience the usual delays, she posts the girls doing their six hundredth sticker book and her hair has zero curl after painstakingly rolling it onto the dern noodle.  Of course through it all her 3 kids did absolutely amazing, and cementing their status as the chosen ones… they are all bumped up to first class. Back at home, Chef Kelton hits the kitchen to sell some pots and pans.  Josie clicks her nails all over the frying pan which is morse code for “buy this crap” and Ktron ends up making noodles and salmon.  Hazel turns 4 and Josie says she wanted a colorful unicorn birthday.  We see Josie and Kelton up late blowing up balloons and decorating everything in the lightest pastel shades, including a fancy cake made with a muted rainbow… not a unicorn to be found anywhere.  Anyway, Hazel seems pretty happy and the whole family poses with big teethy grins while she blows out her candles.  They spent her birthday on the lake with the Barber’s family on the Balka’s big fancy boat.
 
 
 
 
4.What fresh hell is Alyssa Webster cooking up down in Borlando this week, you ask?  Well, she’s attempting to stick to her groundbreaking, never before done, idea of sharing links to items she “uses” and “loves”.  First, she is locked up in her bedroom showing off a bunch of different sunscreens that are all tagged and linked.  She shows 4 of her 5 kids enjoying the pool… Allie is nowhere to be found and let’s hope that’s because she has escaped somewhere fun.  Later, Alyssa is back to sell powdered water flavoring and show off her date night outfit.  She’s in a blazer and ripped jeans.  It’s giving JC Penney Corporate mom meets early 2000s skater chick.  John is cheesing beside her in a pair of high water jeans and some super shiny church shoes.  It’s a lot to take in.  After showing off her breakfast of canned biscuits and turkey bacon, Alyssa gets back to linking her favorite things.  As the week goes on, it gets sadder… and here we are with one link to a $200 stick vacuum that she has Lexi use while she films.  Lexi is dressed up like the good little TradWife she is destined to be, in full house frock and big long bow.  Once that is done, Alyssa heads outside to filter the color out of the sky and post pictures of sad clouds.  Back in her room alone, Alyssa shows off her top swimsuit, which is a one piece from Old Navy that she of course links and says how happy she is that modest swimwear is back in style.  It is?  Alyssa films a tour of her perfectly clean playroom where no children are allowed to play.  The Christmas garland is still up on the bannisters and we see the playroom cabinets that she gleefully cleaned out and filled with the sad hats not even a year ago.  She heaps praise on Lexi who spent an hour cleaning the “girls’ room”.  Lexi stands terrified with a fake smile and in the background is the monstrosity of the triple bunk beds.  She knows the way to mommy dearest’s heart is to clean, clean, clean.  More pool footage is incoming of all of the kids except Allie swimming and playing with cars and a race track.  After praising Rhett for playing with a Matchbox car, she features her next favorite thing… a protein drink that you can buy using her… you guessed… link.  Everything that happens at the Webster house feels forced and scripted and too perfect and anything that isn’t exactly perfect gets filtered within an inch of its life.  Alyssa puts a filter on top of another filter to feature her favorite everyday jewelry.  She wants you to click the link to buy $12 earrings and necklaces.  Take it from her, the breathing mannequin with no nose.  Hopefully, the pennies she earned from this experiment will be enough to get the girls a real drink from the coffee shop instead of the usual free whipped topping and sprinkles.
 
 
 
 
 
5.Whitney and Zach are back from South Carolina and that means it’s time to start pushing education in a box.  Whitney uses a video of baby Lilly eating pizza to draw in her followers and then Khloe stars in the ad for Abeka.  Meanwhile Zach is selling Walmart delivery by making breakfast sandwiches.  These 2 have entered the holy grail of influencing.  Both mom and dad are now cosplaying as QVC hosts, and they cross promote everything.  On her way to the boutique to spend 2 hours filming TikToks, Whitney sells debloat pills using someone else’s picture.  She finishes the ad and immediately goes to Taco Bell so tell us what those magic pills do again?  People want to know about the blue tennis dress she is wearing and Whit is happy to share that it’s LuLuLemon… NOT BSB.  Both she and Zach share a reel showing the family going to the theater to see the new Lilo and Stitch movie, the kids are all in matching T-shirts and the comments light up.  Whitney even gets an exclusive comment from Josie, but mostly what they get are right wing trumpers who are angry about the films “woke agenda”.  Zach shares his “short ribs” recipe again that does not feature short ribs at all.  Instead, it’s a chopped up chuck roast served with gravy and mashed potatoes.  He uses red wine in his recipe and says he can’t wait to write a cookbook.  Bates and write don’t really go together, but I’m sure AI could churn something out for him.  Whitney is filming outside in the same spot she is always in… it remains a mystery if they have installed a pool, but they are heading to see yet another movie…the new Dragon film.  It feels like they have a movie theater partnership, but they aren’t disclosing it.  In another cross promoted reel, Whit takes Jadon to the Boot Barn for his birthday.  He gets boots, a hat and a belt with a huge buckle so he can be a fake cowboy like every other Bates male.  They finish the trip at Sonic… yet another tagged fast food stop for this family of 7 with a wanna be chef father.  In the Bates kitchen we suffer through Zach attempting to make birria tacos.  This includes him mangling the pronunciation of several peppers, dipping his fingers in jars, cans, the food cooking in a pan, and slurping things up without ever washing his hands.  This mess is sponsored by a powdered vitamin that he says helps him make healthy choices.  He chugs down the concoction but can barely hide the disgust on his face.  Back to the birria, which end up being meat and cheese like everything else in this kitchen.  Whitney won’t eat onions or cilantro because of course she won’t and it all ends just as it always does, with Zach double dipping in the sauce and wiping his hands on his pants.  Later, he tells us he is on a diet because he didn’t like the way he looked in his beach pictures.  His diet is no dairy and no gluten for 14 days.  He tells us this while eating a steak and deep fried sweet potato fries.  I don’t know that this man can make it without cheese, mayonnaise, heavy cream and mashed potatoes.  
 
 
 
 
6.Lydia Bates starts her 480th week of pregnancy disgruntled, angry and searching for content.  She’s forced to link and sell her post-partum items because the baby refuses to play along with her timelines, and she heads over to Josie’s to kill time.  She poses for yet another bump photo shoot and heads out to do some Father’s Day shopping with Trace and Ryker.  Golf is Trace’s new personality and we see Ryker pretending to golf just like dear old dad.  She continues to hit the gym each day and gives updates that no one asked for.  She keeps busy by pushing links for pillowcases, and her makeup while complaining that nothing fits.  She says she won’t buy anymore clothes in larger sizes because of course she will be back to a size 0 in a matter of days.  Lydia tells us she is 39 plus 5 days pregnant and she assumed the baby would be here at 38 weeks.  She does all of this while wearing a pool noodle in her hair.  It’s a way to stay in Josie’s good graces.  The weekly vlog starts with Trace promoting another vacuum.  They just had a robot vacuum sponsor, now this and you can see Ryker playing with a dyson stick vacuum while they film.  It’s a small box apartment… how many vacuums do they need?  Let’s ask Maui, the long haired white cat…. Anyway, Kelly Jo is there from last Saturday and Lydia thinks she is in labor after trying Kelly’s tricks, but she is not.  She has her 40 week checkup on June 12th and says her due date is June 13th.  She goes into labor later that evening, and her sister in law comes over to help because she is a nurse.  Addee is keeping Ryker and Josie is going along to help film and document everything.  Trace can’t do anything except stick the camera in Lydia’s face and pull on his hair while rubbing the sides of his face.  The vlog ends with them in the hospital, Lydia getting her epidural, and the cries of a newborn baby.  He says part 2 will be shared soon.  Interesting fact for any Bravo fans… Kristen Doute gave birth this week and her baby’s name is Kaia Rose.  Maybe the name is trending.





7.Erin Paine interrupts her schilling of Father’s Day doodles to take a trip to the farm and check in with Janie.  We see little Willie eating popsicles and watching cows and Erin tells us he is “all boy” in case you weren’t sure.  Back at home, Chad is hard at work packaging exactly 4 orders from their shop, which means there are at least 4 dads who got a box of junk that they had to pretend to like.  Back at the Florida rental, it looks like they’ve added a trampoline to the mess in the backyard.  I’m sure the golfers are overjoyed about this.  Erin spent most of the week in the Instagram pulpit, sharing Bible verses and quotes from old preacher dudes.  She denounces Pride month by saying Biblical Love means telling the truth... of course, her truth is the only one that matters. Then, she says the goal of a Christian is to be so Christlike that people are drawn to God through you. None of these thoughts are cohesive but what’s new?





8. Kelly Joe is the first to congratulate Lawson and Tiffany on their second baby. Now that the cat is out of the bag, Tiffany can post repeatedly that she is a “mom of 2”... and she does this while sharing links to her H&M dresses.  Their time in California leads to Tiffy, her mom and her Aunt exploring old town San Diego with baby Will.  Will is trained to only interact with his parents through the phone so that everytime they start to film, he starts to smile.  Soon enough they head back to Nashville, with the Epsensons tagging along with them.  While the grandparents are in town, Lawson and Tiffy go with them for dinner at a super fancy restaurant where they order chicken and Will throws food around.  Tiffany spends much of the week pushing their YouTube birth announcement which has just over 125,000 views. Lawson is sure to film the whole crew watching Fox News during the military parade.  In case you forget his views... he’s happy to remind you.





9. Michael and Brandon were mostly quiet last week, but she does promote her shop by sharing a photo of the latest Duggar nugget wrapped up tightly in one of her handmade swaddles.  While Michael is silent, Esther Bates decided to hop on Instagram and remind us all that she has turned Nate Bates into the black sheep of the family, and he couldn’t be happier about it.  While traveling to visit Lawson, Esther says they are still living in the RV, but have started building their dream home.  The Duggars are their neighbors so what they consider a dream would be a nightmare for most folks.  Someone asks what Bates sister she speaks to the most and she says Tiffany.  She called an audible on that one bc technically, Tiffy ain’t a “sister”.  Esther says she and Nate are heading back to the Bahamas with one of their wealthy clients on the 4th and her best marriage advice involves a chilli pepper emoji.  She also promotes her burn bootcamp that she attends with a ton of Duggars and says she is obsessed with it... these people become obsessed easily, don’t you know?





10. Bits and Bytes... Carlin films a bump friendly try on for the Boutique, including dresses that appear to be non-bump friendly...Whitney and her cold sore show up to promote the upcoming Cash&Carry with Carlin and there are tons and tons and racks and stacks of clothes behind them... Kelly wishes Hazel a happy birthday and says she is quiet and shy but full of giggles...It appears the new plan for the Boutique is to have Carlin and Whitney pop in, film pieces and parts to reels, and then the other women will edit it all together to appear as if they are there on a daily basis, when we all know they barely grace the premises any more, much less where the clothing...The Boutique rep calls herself a General Manager and says they have a Customer Service Manager and a Social Media Manager.  Everyone gets an important title at BSB...



Have a great week friends!  I know every single one of these fundies posted about worshiping their men on Father’s Day and it’s a much more important day than Mother’s Day could ever hope to be... but we’ll save that for next week.

4.What fresh hell is Alyssa Webster cooking up down in Borlando this week, you ask?  Well, she’s attempting to stick to her groundbreaking, never before done, idea of sharing links to items she “uses” and “loves”.  First, she is locked up in her bedroom showing off a bunch of different sunscreens that are all tagged and linked.  She shows 4 of her 5 kids enjoying the pool… Allie is nowhere to be found and let’s hope that’s because she has escaped somewhere fun.  Later, Alyssa is back to sell powdered water flavoring and show off her date night outfit.  She’s in a blazer and ripped jeans.  It’s giving JC Penney Corporate mom meets early 2000s skater chick.  John is cheesing beside her in a pair of high water jeans and some super shiny church shoes.  It’s a lot to take in.  After showing off her breakfast of canned biscuits and turkey bacon, Alyssa gets back to linking her favorite things.  As the week goes on, it gets sadder… and here we are with one link to a $200 stick vacuum that she has Lexi use while she films.  Lexi is dressed up like the good little TradWife she is destined to be, in full house frock and big long bow.  Once that is done, Alyssa heads outside to filter the color out of the sky and post pictures of sad clouds.  Back in her room alone, Alyssa shows off her top swimsuit, which is a one piece from Old Navy that she of course links and says how happy she is that modest swimwear is back in style.  It is?  Alyssa films a tour of her perfectly clean playroom where no children are allowed to play.  The Christmas garland is still up on the bannisters and we see the playroom cabinets that she gleefully cleaned out and filled with the sad hats not even a year ago.  She heaps praise on Lexi who spent an hour cleaning the “girls’ room”.  Lexi stands terrified with a fake smile and in the background is the monstrosity of the triple bunk beds.  She knows the way to mommy dearest’s heart is to clean, clean, clean.  More pool footage is incoming of all of the kids except Allie swimming and playing with cars and a race track.  After praising Rhett for playing with a Matchbox car, she features her next favorite thing… a protein drink that you can buy using her… you guessed… link.  Everything that happens at the Webster house feels forced and scripted and too perfect and anything that isn’t exactly perfect gets filtered within an inch of its life.  Alyssa puts a filter on top of another filter to feature her favorite everyday jewelry.  She wants you to click the link to buy $12 earrings and necklaces.  Take it from her, the breathing mannequin with no nose.  Hopefully, the pennies she earned from this experiment will be enough to get the girls a real drink from the coffee shop instead of the usual free whipped topping and sprinkles.
 
 
 
 
 
5.Whitney and Zach are back from South Carolina and that means it’s time to start pushing education in a box.  Whitney uses a video of baby Lilly eating pizza to draw in her followers and then Khloe stars in the ad for Abeka.  Meanwhile Zach is selling Walmart delivery by making breakfast sandwiches.  These 2 have entered the holy grail of influencing.  Both mom and dad are now cosplaying as QVC hosts, and they cross promote everything.  On her way to the boutique to spend 2 hours filming TikToks, Whitney sells debloat pills using someone else’s picture.  She finishes the ad and immediately goes to Taco Bell so tell us what those magic pills do again?  People want to know about the blue tennis dress she is wearing and Whit is happy to share that it’s LuLuLemon… NOT BSB.  Both she and Zach share a reel showing the family going to the theater to see the new Lilo and Stitch movie, the kids are all in matching T-shirts and the comments light up.  Whitney even gets an exclusive comment from Josie, but mostly what they get are right wing trumpers who are angry about the films “woke agenda”.  Zach shares his “short ribs” recipe again that does not feature short ribs at all.  Instead, it’s a chopped up chuck roast served with gravy and mashed potatoes.  He uses red wine in his recipe and says he can’t wait to write a cookbook.  Bates and write don’t really go together, but I’m sure AI could churn something out for him.  Whitney is filming outside in the same spot she is always in… it remains a mystery if they have installed a pool, but they are heading to see yet another movie…the new Dragon film.  It feels like they have a movie theater partnership, but they aren’t disclosing it.  In another cross promoted reel, Whit takes Jadon to the Boot Barn for his birthday.  He gets boots, a hat and a belt with a huge buckle so he can be a fake cowboy like every other Bates male.  They finish the trip at Sonic… yet another tagged fast food stop for this family of 7 with a wanna be chef father.  In the Bates kitchen we suffer through Zach attempting to make birria tacos.  This includes him mangling the pronunciation of several peppers, dipping his fingers in jars, cans, the food cooking in a pan, and slurping things up without ever washing his hands.  This mess is sponsored by a powdered vitamin that he says helps him make healthy choices.  He chugs down the concoction but can barely hide the disgust on his face.  Back to the birria, which end up being meat and cheese like everything else in this kitchen.  Whitney won’t eat onions or cilantro because of course she won’t and it all ends just as it always does, with Zach double dipping in the sauce and wiping his hands on his pants.  Later, he tells us he is on a diet because he didn’t like the way he looked in his beach pictures.  His diet is no dairy and no gluten for 14 days.  He tells us this while eating a steak and deep fried sweet potato fries.  I don’t know that this man can make it without cheese, mayonnaise, heavy cream and mashed potatoes.  
 
 
 
 
6.Lydia Bates starts her 480th week of pregnancy disgruntled, angry and searching for content.  She’s forced to link and sell her post-partum items because the baby refuses to play along with her timelines, and she heads over to Josie’s to kill time.  She poses for yet another bump photo shoot and heads out to do some Father’s Day shopping with Trace and Ryker.  Golf is Trace’s new personality and we see Ryker pretending to golf just like dear old dad.  She continues to hit the gym each day and gives updates that no one asked for.  She keeps busy by pushing links for pillowcases, and her makeup while complaining that nothing fits.  She says she won’t buy anymore clothes in larger sizes because of course she will be back to a size 0 in a matter of days.  Lydia tells us she is 39 plus 5 days pregnant and she assumed the baby would be here at 38 weeks.  She does all of this while wearing a pool noodle in her hair.  It’s a way to stay in Josie’s good graces.  The weekly vlog starts with Trace promoting another vacuum.  They just had a robot vacuum sponsor, now this and you can see Ryker playing with a dyson stick vacuum while they film.  It’s a small box apartment… how many vacuums do they need?  Let’s ask Maui, the long haired white cat…. Anyway, Kelly Jo is there from last Saturday and Lydia thinks she is in labor after trying Kelly’s tricks, but she is not.  She has her 40 week checkup on June 12th and says her due date is June 13th.  She goes into labor later that evening, and her sister in law comes over to help because she is a nurse.  Addee is keeping Ryker and Josie is going along to help film and document everything.  Trace can’t do anything except stick the camera in Lydia’s face and pull on his hair while rubbing the sides of his face.  The vlog ends with them in the hospital, Lydia getting her epidural, and the cries of a newborn baby.  He says part 2 will be shared soon.  Interesting fact for any Bravo fans… Kristen Doute gave birth this week and her baby’s name is Kaia Rose.  Maybe the name is trending.





7.Erin Paine interrupts her schilling of Father’s Day doodles to take a trip to the farm and check in with Janie.  We see little Willie eating popsicles and watching cows and Erin tells us he is “all boy” in case you weren’t sure.  Back at home, Chad is hard at work packaging exactly 4 orders from their shop, which means there are at least 4 dads who got a box of junk that they had to pretend to like.  Back at the Florida rental, it looks like they’ve added a trampoline to the mess in the backyard.  I’m sure the golfers are overjoyed about this.  Erin spent most of the week in the Instagram pulpit, sharing Bible verses and quotes from old preacher dudes.  She denounces Pride month by saying Biblical Love means telling the truth... of course, her truth is the only one that matters. Then, she says the goal of a Christian is to be so Christlike that people are drawn to God through you. None of these thoughts are cohesive but what’s new?





8. Kelly Joe is the first to congratulate Lawson and Tiffany on their second baby. Now that the cat is out of the bag, Tiffany can post repeatedly that she is a “mom of 2”... and she does this while sharing links to her H&M dresses.  Their time in California leads to Tiffy, her mom and her Aunt exploring old town San Diego with baby Will.  Will is trained to only interact with his parents through the phone so that everytime they start to film, he starts to smile.  Soon enough they head back to Nashville, with the Epsensons tagging along with them.  While the grandparents are in town, Lawson and Tiffy go with them for dinner at a super fancy restaurant where they order chicken and Will throws food around.  Tiffany spends much of the week pushing their YouTube birth announcement which has just over 125,000 views. Lawson is sure to film the whole crew watching Fox News during the military parade.  In case you forget his views... he’s happy to remind you.





9. Michael and Brandon were mostly quiet last week, but she does promote her shop by sharing a photo of the latest Duggar nugget wrapped up tightly in one of her handmade swaddles.  While Michael is silent, Esther Bates decided to hop on Instagram and remind us all that she has turned Nate Bates into the black sheep of the family, and he couldn’t be happier about it.  While traveling to visit Lawson, Esther says they are still living in the RV, but have started building their dream home.  The Duggars are their neighbors so what they consider a dream would be a nightmare for most folks.  Someone asks what Bates sister she speaks to the most and she says Tiffany.  She called an audible on that one bc technically, Tiffy ain’t a “sister”.  Esther says she and Nate are heading back to the Bahamas with one of their wealthy clients on the 4th and her best marriage advice involves a chilli pepper emoji.  She also promotes her burn bootcamp that she attends with a ton of Duggars and says she is obsessed with it... these people become obsessed easily, don’t you know?





10. Bits and Bytes... Carlin films a bump friendly try on for the Boutique, including dresses that appear to be non-bump friendly...Whitney and her cold sore show up to promote the upcoming Cash&Carry with Carlin and there are tons and tons and racks and stacks of clothes behind them... Kelly wishes Hazel a happy birthday and says she is quiet and shy but full of giggles...It appears the new plan for the Boutique is to have Carlin and Whitney pop in, film pieces and parts to reels, and then the other women will edit it all together to appear as if they are there on a daily basis, when we all know they barely grace the premises any more, much less where the clothing...The Boutique rep calls herself a General Manager and says they have a Customer Service Manager and a Social Media Manager.  Everyone gets an important title at BSB...



Have a great week friends!  I know every single one of these fundies posted about worshiping their men on Father’s Day and it’s a much more important day than Mother’s Day could ever hope to be... but we’ll save that for next week.

1ld39xn,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1ld39xn/sirens_swan_song_a_tale_of_broken_beans_and/,Siren's Swan Song: A Tale of Broken Beans and Betrayal,"Prepare yourselves for a journey. An experience.

Oh the great Siren, how we know her well. Or so we thought... Our great patron has a dark side. The customers know her as a bestower of caffeine, sugar, and all things that keep them from resting. But we are no fools. We know the sadistic pleasures she indulges in.
Our story begins not so long ago. The quest: Back to Starbucks. The mission? Vague. The cost?
We have no arms.
They are gone. You will not be compensated. That is the cost you fool, did you not read the nonexistent fine print?
Now that I have your attention, let us begin the journey.
I found myself a small and trembling green bean many years ago. I toiled away, becoming an immovable pillar of steamed milk and perfected crosshatches. Did it pain me? Yes. Greatly, but I pushed on. Determined. Eager. Under the power of eight blonde shots of espresso I was unstoppable. But I was played the jester. The fool.
My wrist, my beloved, could not withstand my glorious feats of latte art and whipped cream mountains. The dark cloud of carpal tunnel settled over my body, laughing as I fell in defeat.
But a light broke through. Physical therapy, a recuperation of my failed limb. I grew stronger. My wrist became jacked. With this ethereal healing, I gained the ability to haul four bags of milk to the fridges that yearned for them. I was back.
I gained a companion in my journey, a trusted ally who also followed the path of the Siren. Over the years I watched as the fresh green bean sprouted into a powerful warrior, a champion on bar and interacted on till with the flair of a drag queen giving her ultimate performance. 
But as many stories of adventure go, there was a great calamity.
A small beast, one easily overlooked. An annoyance that we foolishly convinced ourselves to tolerate, despite suspicions of what it could bring. The pains we knew it could cause. We sent warning to our overseer of the risk, but it was brushed aside. Surely the Siren would not give us a task we could not perform. So, with caution, we began to scribe onto cups, hoping to please our masters so we would not be penalized for disobedience. Once again, we were played the fools. 
It was a disarming beast. One with a slow, yet potent venom. A venom that seeps into your bones before you're even aware you've been infected with it. And after several months of it settling in deep and making itself a home, it struck. Again.
Carpal tunnel. But not just in my own limb this time. No, that would be too kind. In the limb of my ally. In the limb of the other party members we had met along the way. Several followers of the Siren, now left with pain and betrayal. A simple scribing job would have been more forgiving. But the Siren demanded speed. Perfection. Quantity. More. More. More. Uncaring of the strain already brought by her other demands of us. The strain that most had found the skills to manage up until this adjustment of our duties. And as we each fell, the burden of our station was tossed onto the ever growing pile upon the shoulders of those remaining. No others were called upon to lighten the load. No other adventurers were rallied to learn the trade. We were left to be dropped like we were indeed too scalding to hold. 
The overseer insisted we were just lacking vision, stubborn in the face of change. We disagreed, but vocally as we could not raise our hands in protest. Our poor, braced and bandaged hands. Searing. Swollen. Stiff. Screaming.
One of our allies, the bean whom I'd watched grow into a fine master of craft, fell further into the venomous pit. Left unable to continue our journey. Their standard joys in their own free time consumed with nothing as they lost the use of their arm. Healing was said to be possible, but time was not debatable. Rest and time. Physical therapy. Injections.
Surely, such a state caused by the quest that was laid out by our patron, would be compensated while they recovered? Surely there would be some agreement in regards to where, and with whom, the role of responsibility rested?
Surely the correct information would be passed along to the group that was responsible for said compensation?
Fools. Again.
For our overseer did not place importance in such things. Rather concerningly incorrect information about my beloved friend was passed on to the higher power determining whether they were worthy of keeping house and home while they recovered. And by incorrect, I do mean completely wrong. Not even the correct limb was referenced in the report. Any agreements the man had made about the injury that my ally faced were immediately twisted on their side in his report. The man had played us like the paper he submitted. Double sided. Two faced.
When those determining the worth of the report contacted my peer, they repeated the false information they had received, regardless of correction. They were quick to anger. To insist that it was a decision the adventurer had made to not be able. Not the reality that they found themselves in.
Even with the professional input of a doctor, an insistence that they were not to continue the labour set out by the Siren at the risk of more damage, both the overseer and those with the power to allow them peace of mind scoffed. Because how much weight do a doctors words hold? It should be an immovable weight in all realities. Unable to be ignored.
It brought a much beloved and used saying to our minds. 
Gaslight. Girlboss. And by all means gatekeep.
Surely, none are worthy of food and shelter after being maimed by the Siren. Rub some coffee grounds in in. Stand up and smile. Say hello. Do your work, but make sure it's within the allotted four minutes for each person.
The others in our party were left baffled. Because surely, with the arrival of these new expections correlating with so very many new injuries, this could easily be construed as the cause?
So I put out the call. To all beans green and heavily roasted. Have you too fallen to the Sirens demands, with your arms taken as sacrifice? Let us band our broken arms together. Please share your tales so we may attempt to lift this curse and regain our arms once more.

Well a few weeks ago I was doing laudery and there was socks in the dryer I didn't know who they were so like a good sibling I put it on the side all together in eyes view, weelll apparently these were hopes and whail im in my room burst into my room yelling about how rude it is to touch some ones clothing and now she can't find them, I try to say its don't stairs im met with more screaming, so I go down and show here then she went silent, ""YOU COULD HAVE BROUGHT THEM RO MY ROOM""-hope.  Huh so I had it I left saying im ganna straight thing up and went to a store and got a white board, and hung it in the kitchen, creating a list of HOPE RULES, a list of rules she been abiding by and been tormenting us with, and sent the image, and lets just say she didn't like it, and went to my brother Nick saying how he needed to put his bothers in line, we'll Nick hung up the phone and me I refused to talk to my sister. 

A week passed I only had maby said like 10 - 20 words to her since, yester day was father's day so I wanted to have a make up father's day to enjoy with and so I went a got a new grill, food, and a present all for my dad, then around 1 ish I got home to my brother Timothy, he was getting ready for a job interview and we were talking and then Hope tried to enter the conversation, but Timothy didn't ignored her and so did I why he ignored her I don't know why but I don't care then she got upset, and came into the kitchen, and reached for an empty coffee pot and ""poured"" coffee between us like touching distance, and then said how we shouldn't ignore her and way is she being treated this way but I just kept ignoring her and finaly she noticed I was ignoring her, well she started holding the barly filled coffee cup threatening to throw it on him, now before this is heard this one reddit where they just recorded them becuse they would never do it in public and I brought the idea to my dad and he told my other two brothers to record her if she trys anything so we did and at the moment of her threats of coffe before my bothers job interview, out comes my phone and well she took one look an out she went, it worked. Later im hanging out on the couch and here she comes threatens to never talk to me again if I keep ignoring here, ya that's the point I think but for my safety I wipe out the handy dandy phone and press record, she didn't care for that so she came at me and tried to push and shove the phone from my hands and in my defense I pushed her away the when she started pushing back i tackled her to the couch and put one arm around her and held her there she of couse did a 360 and began screaming ""how I could do this and she did nothing to me"", i told her ""you came at me and attacked me"", she the said ""I only tried to ripe the phone from my hand"", like WTF YA RIGHT, spot on there. So I held her down because she been known to alwas attack you when ever she free so I held her down until she had no more fight in her and I let go, and got up and away quickly well she laid there for a whail just crying how could have done this but I had it there I let go every little thing she been doing to us, I screamed how abusive she is to us putting my dad 3000 in debt like it was nothing that man had to loan agianst his 4O1K for the cash, and I even let money to my dad to help, she could never hold on to a friend because in her inner circle is like the 3rd ring of he'll and they alwas back out, how every one was afraid of her but me never again I don't do night shift just to be afraid of a psycho bully.

I started my apartment search but am a little overwhelmed by the options and what I've heard about the Chicago busy season. My main decision right now is trying to pick a neighborhood to live in.

I'm 25 (going on 26) year old woman and am looking to live on my own. I want to live somewhere where I can meet other people in their mid-20's since I'll be new to the city. Thinking a place with a good nightlife, cool bars, places to dance. I also love a good vintage store and chill coffee shop. Obviously being by the lake would be great since I spend most of my summers outside right now, but I don't mind being a little further away as long as it's easy to get there. 

I know people say a good starting spot is Lakeview or Lincoln Park, but I've heard it's not super diverse and coming from the suburbs, I'm definitely looking for some more diversity (let me know if that's not the case tho!) . While I will have a car, I definitely want to take full advantage and use public transport/live somewhere super walkable! There is also a caveat that I have to commute to the west suburbs once a week for work so I don't want that commute to be too crazy as well.

It currently sits at $70. 

Looking at Luckin Coffee (LKNCY), the stock price has gone up nearly 25x in the past 5 years, from a low of $1.35 (in June 2020) to its recent highs of $36.  

Then you look at Starbucks (SBUX) and it’s growth has stagnated. The stock price has fluctuated within $50/share swings within the past 5 years, but overall, there doesn’t seem to be any growth.  Why is it so different than the other two companies?  Is SBUX messing up?  Or are the other two being manipulated?  Does SBUX have a shot at getting a double or triple in price per share?  I significantly doubt it, but why are the other two companies getting them while SBUX is not?  In potentially related news, SBUX is supposedly going to start providing protein-rich beverages, which may reinvigorate growth. And they are still early in whatever plans the new CEO wants to implement, so it is far too early to know if they are working or not.

* **Display**: 14” or 15.6” is ideal for comfort, HD is standard.
* **Processor**: Intel N-series, Celeron, or AMD Ryzen 3 are fine for daily stuff.

**Tip:** Always read recent reviews—manufacturers swap out specs more than you think!

# Final Recommendation: What Should You Choose?

If you want **the best bang for your buck and reliable daily performance**, the **Acer Aspire 3** is your go-to.  
But if carrying something light everywhere is key, snag the **Lenovo IdeaPad 1**, or if you’re just looking for the absolute cheapest functional laptop, go with the **HP 14"" Laptop**.

1ld2wqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ld2wqv/if_my_life_is_over_theirs_are_too/,"If My Life Is Over, Theirs Are Too.","Robert Hayes never expected to feel joy again after Anna died. Some nights, he still woke reaching for her—fumbling blindly through the darkness for a hand that would never be there again. Grief, he realized, had a smell: old clothes, cold sheets, unopened mail.

Just before Anna’s passing, the twins had been born—tiny, furious fists clenching at the air. Every new day with them had felt like a second chance. Emma, with her mother's green eyes and fierce little laugh. Samuel, quieter, thoughtful even as an infant, furrowing his brow like he was trying to solve the world's problems.

They filled the house with life again. Noise. Color. Robert cooked terrible pancakes every Sunday—Emma demanding extra syrup, Samuel meticulously sorting his blueberries before eating. He read to them every night, even when they fell asleep halfway through. They built snowmen with mittened hands in the winter, fed ducks at the pond in spring, ran barefoot through sprinklers under the sticky heat of summer.

And every night, after the giggles and the mess and the exhaustion, Robert kissed their foreheads and whispered the same thing: ""I will always protect you.""

He meant it.

That November afternoon was gray and damp, the misty rain making the world look like it was dissolving at the edges. Emma wanted a pumpkin ""big enough to sit inside,"" while Samuel had chosen one lopsided and scarred, insisting it had ""character."" Robert strapped them into their booster seats, singing along with the radio, the car filled with syrupy, sticky laughter.

The semi-truck came out of nowhere. One moment: headlights. The next: twisting metal. Then—silence.

When Robert came to, hanging upside down from his seatbelt, the only sound was the soft hiss of the ruined engine. He screamed for them. Clawed at the wreckage. Dragged himself, bleeding and broken, toward the back. Emma and Samuel were gone. Still buckled in, so small, so still.

At the funeral, Robert stood between two tiny white caskets, staring as faces blurred around him and words tumbled into meaningless noise.

""God has a plan."" ""They're angels now."" ""Time heals.""

Time, Robert thought numbly, had already taken everything.

That night, alone in the nursery, clutching a sock no bigger than his thumb, he whispered the only prayer left to him: ""Bring them back.""

No one answered.

# Chapter 2: Hollow Men

The days after the funeral blurred together, each one a paler copy of the last. Robert woke at dawn, not because he wanted to, but because the house demanded it—cruel reminders of a life that no longer existed. Samuel’s alarm still chirped at seven a.m., a tiny little jingle that once made Samuel giggle under the covers. Robert couldn’t bring himself to turn it off. He brewed coffee he didn’t drink, packed lunches no one would eat, reached for tiny jackets that would never again be worn. Every movement ended the same way: with the silence pressing in like water in a sinking room.

He tried to hold the pieces together at first. Sat stiffly in grief counseling groups while strangers passed sorrow back and forth like trading cards. He nodded at the talk of “stages,” “healing,” “coping,” while his chest felt like it was filling with wet cement. He adopted a dog—a golden retriever named Daisy. The shelter said she was “good with kids.” Robert brought her home, hoping maybe something would spark again. But Daisy only whined at the door, as if she, too, was waiting for children who would never come home. Three days later, he returned her. The woman at the shelter didn’t ask why.

By spring, the house was immaculate, sterile—as if polished grief could make it livable again. The nursery remained untouched. The firetruck sat mid-rescue on the rug. A doll lay half-tucked beneath a tiny pillow, eternally ready for sleep. Sometimes Robert thought he heard them laughing upstairs, voices soft and wild and real as breath. Sometimes, he answered back.

Outside, the world moved on. Children shrieked with joy in parks. Mothers chased toddlers through grocery aisles. Fathers hoisted giggling kids onto their shoulders at county fairs. At first, Robert turned away from these scenes, flinching like they were gunshots. But soon, he began to watch. He stood in the shadows of the elementary school parking lot, leaning against his rusted truck, staring at the children spilling through the doors—backpacks bouncing, shoes untied, voices lifted in a chorus of lives untouched by loss.

""Why them?"" he thought. ""Why not mine?""

The resentment crept in like mold beneath the wallpaper—quiet, patient, inevitable.

One evening, he sat alone in the dim light of the living room. An untouched bottle of whiskey sat on the table, sweating with condensation. The television flickered with cartoons—a plastic family around a plastic dinner table, all laughter and pastel perfection. Robert stared at the screen. Then, without warning, he hurled the remote across the room. It shattered against the wall, leaving a long, ugly crack.

His chest heaved with silent, shaking sobs. Not for Anna. Not even for Emma and Samuel. But for himself. For the man he used to be. For the father he failed to stay.

The next morning, without planning to, Robert drove to the school lot before dawn. The world was still dark, the pavement damp with night. A bright blue minivan caught his eye—plastered with “Proud Parent” stickers and stick-figure decals of smiling children, their parents, and two dogs. Robert knelt beside it, the pocketknife flashing briefly in the dim light. He peeled the tiny stick-figure children from the back window, one by one. Then he slashed the tire, slow and steady, the blade whispering through rubber like breath.

When the mother discovered the damage hours later—cursing, frantic, dragging her children into another car—Robert smiled for the first time in months. A small, broken thing. It didn’t fix anything. It didn’t bring Emma and Samuel back. But it shifted the weight in his chest—just enough for him to breathe.

That night, he dreamed of them. Emma laughing, Samuel running barefoot through the grass, fireflies sparking in the gold-washed twilight. He woke to silence, the dream already fading. But something else stirred beneath the grief.

A flicker.

Control.

# Chapter 3: Seeds of Malice

The second time, it wasn’t enough to slash a tire. Robert needed them to feel it. Not just the inconvenience, not just the momentary panic. He needed them to understand that joy was a fragile, a borrowed thing—one that could be ripped away just as suddenly as it was given. Like his had been.

At dusk, the school parking lot stood silent, the last child long since swept up in a waiting minivan. Robert moved through the rows of bicycles like a man walking among gravestones. Each one upright. Untouched. Proud. He slipped a box cutter from his coat pocket. The first brake cable sliced with almost no resistance. Then another. Then another. He moved methodically—his grief becoming surgical.

The next morning, from the privacy of his truck, Robert watched a boy coast down a hill—fast, laughing, light. And then the bike didn’t stop. The child’s face turned. Laughter crumpled into terror. He crashed hard, metal meeting bone. A broken wrist. Blood in his mouth. Screams.

Parents swarmed like bees kicked from a hive, their voices panicked, their eyes wide. Robert didn’t move. He watched it all with hands trembling faintly in his lap.

He thought it would be enough.

But two weeks later, the boy returned. Cast on his arm. A gap where his front teeth had been. And he was laughing again. Like nothing had changed.

Robert’s jaw clenched until it hurt. They hadn’t learned. They had already begun to forget.

The annual Harvest Festival arrived in a blur of orange booths and plastic spiderwebs, cotton candy, and hay bales. Children raced from game to game, cheeks flushed from the cold, arms swinging bags of prizes. He moved through the maze like a ghost. No one looked twice at the man with the hood pulled low. Why would they?

Children leaned over tubs of apples, dunking their heads, emerging with triumphant smiles. Emma would have loved this. She would have squealed with laughter, water dripping from her curls, cheeks red from the chill.

His hands shook as he slipped the crushed glass into the tub. Ground fine—but not invisible. Sharp enough. Just sharp enough. He lingered nearby, heart pounding like a drum inside his ribs.

The first scream cut through the carnival like lightning. A boy stumbled back from the tub, blood streaming from his mouth, his cry high and broken. More screams followed. Mothers pulled their children close. Booths tipped. Lights flickered. The festival collapsed into chaos.

Still—not enough.

Robert returned home and sat in the nursery. The crib was cold. The racecar bed untouched. The silence as thick as syrup. He sat on the hardwood floor, knees to his chest, and whispered:

""They don’t remember you.""

His voice cracked. Not from rage. But from emptiness.

The playground came next. The place they had loved the most.

At three in the morning, Robert crept across the dewy grass, fog clinging low, as if the world were trying to hide what he was becoming. He wore gloves. Moved like a man fixing something broken. He loosened the bolts on the swings just enough that the nuts would fall after a few good pushes. He smeared grease across the rungs of the slide. Buried broken glass beneath the innocent softness of the sandbox. Then he left.

The next day, he parked nearby, watching as the playground filled with children again. The laughter returned so easily, as if it had never left.

Then came the fall.

A boy—maybe six—slipped from the monkey bars and struck his head on the edge of the platform. Blood pooled in the dirt. His mother’s scream sounded like something being torn in half. An ambulance arrived. The playground emptied.

Robert sat in his truck and felt that same flicker in his chest. Not joy. Not peace.

But control.

For a moment, he wasn’t the man who had clutched a tiny sock and begged God to make a trade. He was the one who turned the screws. The one who made the world bend.

He didn’t stop.

# Chapter 4: The Gentle Push

The river ran like an old scar along the edge of Halston, swollen and restless after weeks of rain. Robert stood alone at the water’s edge, the damp earth sucking at his boots, the air cold enough to bite through his coat. Across the park, families moved like faint shadows in the fog, children darting between the trees, their laughter muted and distant, like memories worn thin by time.

He watched them without blinking.

He watched him.

A small boy, maybe five or six years old, wandered away from the others, rain boots slapping through shallow puddles, his coat slipping off one shoulder. Robert saw how easily it happened—the gap between a parent's distracted glance, the careless joy of a child unaware of how quickly the world could take everything from him.

Robert moved without thinking. Not planning. Not deciding. Just following the pull inside him, a pull shaped by loss and stitched together with rage.

He crossed the grass in slow, steady strides, boots silent against the wet earth. When he reached the boy, he didn't say a word. He simply placed a hand on the child's small back—a touch as light as breath, the kind of touch a father might give to steady his son, to guide him back to safety.

But this time, there was no safety.

The boy stumbled forward. The slick ground gave way beneath his boots. His arms flailed once, a startled gasp escaping his mouth, and then the river took him.

No thrashing. No screaming. Just the slow, cold pull of the current swallowing him whole.

Robert turned away before the first cries rang out. He walked into the trees, his breath misting in the frigid air, his hands curling into fists inside his sleeves. Behind him, screams split the fog, voices shattered the quiet—parents running, wading into the water too late.

He didn’t stop. He didn’t look back.

That night, Robert sat cross-legged between Emma’s crib and Samuel’s racecar bed. The nursery smelled of dust and faded dreams. He placed his hands in his lap, palms open like a man offering an apology no one would ever hear, and he whispered into the hollow silence:

""I made it fair.""

The words tasted like ash on his tongue.

For the first time in months, he slept through the night, deep and dreamless.

But morning brought no peace.

By noon, the riverbank had transformed into a shrine. Flowers and stuffed animals lined the muddy ground. Notes written in childish handwriting flapped in the wind. Candles guttered against the damp air. Children stood holding hands, their faces pale with confusion as their parents clutched them tighter, their grief raw and noisy.

Robert drove past slowly, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. He watched them weep, saw their shoulders shake with the weight of a loss they couldn’t contain.

For a moment, he felt something close to satisfaction. A shifting of the scales.

But as he rounded the bend and the river disappeared from view, the satisfaction dissolved, leaving behind a familiar emptiness.

They would mourn today. Tomorrow, they would forget.

They always forget.

# Chapter 5: The Town Crumbles

Three days later, the boy’s body was pulled from the river, tangled in roots and mud, bloated from the cold. The coroner called it an accident. Drowning. A tragic slip. Everyone in Halston nodded and murmured and avoided each other’s eyes. But something changed.

The parks emptied. Sidewalks once buzzing with bikes and hopscotch now lay silent under cloudy skies. Parents walked their children to school in tight clumps, hands gripped a little too tightly, eyes flicking to every passing car. Playgrounds stood deserted beneath creaking swings and rusting chains. But it didn’t last.

A week passed. Then another. The fences around the park came down. Children returned—cautious at first, then louder, bolder. The shrieks of joy returned, diluted with only a trace of caution. The town, like it always did, began to forget.

Robert couldn’t stand it.

He returned to the scene of the first fall—Miller Park—under the cover of fog and early morning darkness. The playground had been repaired. New bolts gleamed beneath the swing seats. New paint shone on the monkey bars.

Robert smiled bitterly. Then he went to work.

He loosened the bolts again, not so much that they would fall immediately, but just enough to ensure failure. Enough to remind. Enough to reopen the wound.

That morning, a boy ran ahead of his mother, eager to swing higher, faster. Robert watched from his truck as the seat tore loose in mid-air, the boy thrown to the gravel below like a puppet with its strings cut. Another scream. Another ambulance. Another tiny victory. But it wasn’t enough.

One broken arm would never equal two coffins.

Thanksgiving loomed, brittle and joyless. Halston strung up lights, tried to bake its way back into comfort, but everything tasted like fear. Robert didn’t feel it soften. If anything, the ache in his chest had sharpened.

He found his next moment during a birthday party—balloons tied to fence posts, paper hats, children screaming with sugared laughter. Seven years old. The age Emma and Samuel would have been.

He watched from the alley behind the house, his jacket dusted with soot to match the disguise—just another utility worker. He didn’t need threats or blackmail this time. He didn’t need help.

Just a soft smile. A kind voice. A simple story about a missing puppy.

The little girl followed him willingly.

In the plastic playhouse near the edge of the yard, Robert tucked her gently beneath unopened presents. Her arms were folded neatly. Her hair smoothed back. He set Emma’s old music box beside her, its tune warped and gasping. It played three broken notes before clicking into silence.

She looked like she was sleeping.

By the time the party noticed she was missing, Robert was already miles away. He drove in silence, humming the lullaby softly under his breath, as if to soothe himself more than her.

But the hollow inside him didn’t shrink.

Winter came early that year. Snow blanketed the sidewalks. The playgrounds stayed empty now—not because of caution, but because of cold. Christmas lights blinked behind drawn curtains. People whispered more often than they spoke.

And still, the town tried to move forward.

Robert watched two boys skipping stones into the water where the river hadn’t yet frozen. They were brothers. They laughed without fear. Without consequence.

Samuel should have had a brother to skip stones with.

Robert crouched beside them. Smiled. Held out a daisy chain he had woven in the truck—white flowers strung together with trembling hands. The boys giggled and reached for it.

He guided them closer to the edge.

One soft push.

The river accepted them.

When their bodies were found seventeen days later, wrapped in each other’s arms beneath a frozen bend, the daisy chain had vanished. But Robert still saw it—looped around their wrists like a crown of thorns.

Elsewhere in town, Linda Moore sat in front of her computer. Her spreadsheet blinked. A child’s name—Eli Meyers—suddenly shifted rows. Not one she had touched. Not one she had assigned.

Beside the name, a new comment appeared: “He looks like Samuel did when he lost his first tooth.”

Then a new tab opened—her niece’s photo, taken from outside the school that morning. Through a window. Across glass.

The screen blinked red: “She still likes hide-and-seek, right?”

Linda’s hands hovered over the keys. She didn’t call anyone. She didn’t say anything. She just let the change stand.

That afternoon, Eli boarded the wrong van for a field trip. When the chaperones reached the botanical gardens, they came up one short. They retraced every step, called his name until their voices cracked. But Eli was gone.

The police found his backpack three days later, tucked under a hedge near the perimeter fence. Zipper closed. Lunch untouched. No struggle. No footprints. No sign of him at all.

Just silence.

The school shut down its field trip program. Metal detectors were installed the next week—secondhand machines that buzzed even when touched gently. Classroom doors were fitted with new locks. Parent volunteers were fingerprinted. A dusk curfew followed.

In a closed-door meeting, someone on the city council finally said it out loud:

“Sabotage.”

Maria Vance stood outside Halston Elementary the next morning. The sky was gray, the cold sharp enough to sting. Parents didn’t make eye contact. Teachers moved like ghosts. Children whispered like everything was a secret.

Maria didn’t need the pins on her map anymore. She could feel the pattern in her bones.

This wasn’t chaos.

This was design.

And whoever was behind it… they were just getting started.

# Chapter 6: Graves and Whispers

Another funeral. Another headline. Another casket lowered into the frozen ground while a town full of trembling hands tried to convince themselves that prayer could hold back death. Halston draped itself in mourning again, but the grief rang hollow. They weren’t mourning Robert’s children. They were mourning their own safety, their own illusions.

Still, life in Halston ground on. The grocery stores stayed open. The school bell still rang. The church choir resumed, voices cracking on and off-key. Robert watched it all from the outside, a man staring through glass at a world he no longer belonged to. Their fear wasn’t enough. Their tears weren't enough. They had forgotten Emma and Samuel.

So he decided to make them remember.

He found the perfect place: a crumbling church tucked into a forgotten bend of road, its steeple sagging like a broken finger pointed skyward. Once a place of baptisms and vows, now it stank of mildew and mouse droppings. Still, there was something fitting about it. Robert prepared carefully. He built a crude cross out of rotting pew backs. He scavenged candles from a thrift store bin. He smuggled in a battered cassette deck, loaded with a single song—""Safe in His Arms,"" warped and warbling with age.

He thought about Emma humming along to hymns in the backseat, Samuel tapping his feet without knowing the words. He thought about the empty nursery and the promises he had failed to keep.

The boy he chose wasn’t special. Just small. Just alone. Harold Knox, the school bus driver, had been warned months before. A photo of his daughter tucked inside his glovebox. A note in red marker: ""He will suffer. Or she will."" Nails delivered in a plain manila envelope.

On a cold Thursday morning, the bus paused at Pine Creek stop. Fog licked the ground like low smoke. One child stepped off. The doors hissed shut behind him. Robert was waiting in the trees.

The boy didn’t scream. He didn’t run. He simply blinked up at the man reaching out to him. Inside the ruined church, Robert worked quickly but carefully. The child was lifted onto the wooden cross, his back pressed to the splintering wood. Nails were driven through soft palms and tender feet. Not savagely—but deliberately, with grim reverence. Each strike of the hammer echoed through the empty rafters like the tolling of a slow funeral bell.

""You'll see them soon,"" Robert whispered as he drove the final nail home. ""My little ones are waiting.""

He placed a paper crown on the boy’s brow. Smeared a rough ash cross over the child's small chest. Lit six candles at the base of the altar. Then he pressed play. The hymn trickled through the cold, rotten air, warbling and distant. Robert stood for a long moment, his eyes stinging, before he turned and walked away. He locked the doors behind him, leaving the boy crucified beneath the broken arches.

It was the boy’s mother who found him. She had followed the music, though no one else had heard it. She had forced the heavy doors open and fallen to her knees at the sight. The boy was alive. Barely. But something essential in him—something fragile and bright—had been extinguished forever.

Halston did not rally around this tragedy. There were no vigils. No bake sales. No Facebook groups offering casseroles and prayers. They shut their church doors. Canceled choir practice. Turned their faces away from their own shame.

Maria Vance stood outside the ruined church, the rain soaking through her coat, her hair plastered to her forehead. She didn’t light a cigarette. Didn’t open her notepad. She just stared through the doorway at the altar, at the boy nailed to the cross, at the candles sputtering against the wet wind.

This wasn’t revenge anymore. It wasn’t even grief. This was ritual.

That night, Maria tore everything off the walls of her office. Maps, photographs, reports—all of it came down. She started over with red string and thumbtacks, tracing each death, each disappearance, each shattered life. And when she stepped back, she saw it for what it was: a spiral.

Not random chaos. Not accidents. A wound closing in on itself.

At its center: silence. No fingerprints. No footprints. No smoking gun. Just grief. And grief was spreading like infection.

Parents pulled their children out of school. The Christmas pageant was canceled. The playgrounds sat under gathering drifts of snow, swings frozen mid-sway. Stores boarded their windows after dark. Halston was curling inward, shrinking, dying a little more each day.

And somewhere, Maria knew, the hand behind all of it was still moving.

She didn’t have proof. Not yet. But she could feel it in her bones.

This wasn’t over. Not even close.

Late that night, staring at her empty wall, Maria whispered to the darkness: ""I’m coming for you.""

And somewhere out in the dead heart of Halston, something whispered back.

# Chapter 7: The Spider’s Web

The sketchbook was found by accident, jammed between a stack of overdue returns at the Halston Public Library. A volunteer almost tossed it into the donation bin without looking. Curiosity saved it—and maybe saved lives.

At first glance, it looked like any child's notebook. Tattered corners. Smudges of dirt. But inside, Maria Vance saw what others might have missed. She flipped through the pages with gloved hands, her stomach tightening with every turn.

Children, sketched in trembling pencil lines, filled the pages. Their faces twisted in terror. Scenes of drowning, of falling, of burning playgrounds and broken swings. Some pages had dates scrawled in the margins—events that had already happened. Others bore dates that hadn’t yet arrived.

Mixed among the drawings were music notes, faint staves from hymns, each line annotated with uneven, obsessive care. On one page, three candles formed a triangle, familiar from the church scene. On another, a child's chest bore the ash cross Robert had smeared. It was all there—mapped in quiet, meticulous horror.

One line, scrawled over and over in the margins, stopped Maria cold: ""I don’t want them to suffer. I want them to remember. To feel it. To see them. Emma liked daisies. Samuel hated swings. They laughed on rainy days. Please. Remember.""

She pressed her hand to her mouth, her eyes stinging. This wasn’t just violence. This was love—twisted, broken love, weaponized into something unrecognizable.

At the bottom of many pages, a code repeated again and again: 19.73.14.8.21

It wasn’t a phone number. It wasn’t coordinates. It wasn’t a date. Maria stayed up all night breaking it down. Old habits from cold cases surfaced—simple alphanumeric cipher: A=1, B=2, and so on.

S.M.H.H.U.

Nonsense, until she cross-referenced abandoned businesses in Halston's property records.

Samuel’s Mobile Home Hardware Utility. A tiny repair shop that had shuttered years ago, its letters still ghosting across a sagging storefront.

The lease belonged to a man who had never made the papers until now: Robert Hayes.

No criminal record. No complaints. No outstanding bills. His name surfaced once, buried in an old laptop repair registration. The name Anna Hayes appeared alongside his. Deceased. Along with two children: Emma and Samuel. A car crash, two years prior.

Maria’s pulse pounded in her ears. She pulled the warrant herself. No backup. No news vans. Just her badge and a city-issued key.

The house at the end of Chestnut Lane looked abandoned. The windows were boarded. Weeds clawed their way up the front steps. But inside, the air smelled like grief had been embalmed into the walls.

She moved slowly, her footsteps muffled against the dust. The kitchen was stripped bare. The living room was hollowed out, the couch gone, the tables missing. Only the nursery remained untouched.

Two beds—one tiny racecar frame, one white-painted crib. Tiny shoes lined up neatly against the wall. Crayon drawings taped with careful hands: Emma holding a daisy. Samuel clutching a paper star.

Maria’s throat tightened. She knelt by the crib and saw it— A loose floorboard, cut precisely.

Underneath, she found a panel. And beneath the panel: photographs.

Hundreds of them.

Children on swings. Children walking home from school. A girl climbing the jungle gym. A boy waiting at a crosswalk. Her own niece, captured through the glass of a cafeteria window. Even herself—photographed at her office window, late at night, unaware.

On the back of her photo, in red marker, someone had scrawled: ""Even the strong lose their children.""

Maria staggered back, the room tilting. Robert hadn’t been lashing out blindly. He had been orchestrating this, piece by piece, grief by grief.

He had built a web.

And now she was standing at its center.

# Chapter 8: The Broken Father

They found him at an abandoned grain silo just outside Halston, a skeleton of rust and rotted beams forgotten by progress. The frost clung to the metal, and the morning mist wrapped around the place like a shroud.

Inside, twenty children sat in a wide circle, drowsy, confused, but alive. Their hands were zip-tied loosely in front of them—no bruises, no screaming. Only a heavy, drugged stillness. The air smelled of damp hay, gasoline, and old metal. Makeshift wiring coiled around the support beams, tangled like veins. Propane tanks sat beneath them, linked by a taut, quivering wire.

At the center stood Robert Hayes.

He was barefoot, his clothes coated in dust and ash, his hair hanging in ragged tufts over his eyes. In one hand, he clutched a worn photograph—Emma dressed in an orange pumpkin costume, Samuel wearing a ghost sheet too big for him, chocolate smeared across his chin. The picture was bent, the edges soft from being touched too often.

In his other hand: the detonator.

Maria Vance pushed past the barricades before anyone could stop her. She left her gun holstered. She left the shouting negotiators behind. She moved through the broken doorway into the silo’s yawning cold, stepping carefully as if entering a church.

Robert didn’t look at her at first. His thumb brushed across Samuel’s face in the photo, tender and trembling. When he finally raised his eyes, they were dark hollows rimmed with exhaustion—not anger. Not even madness.

Just grief.

""They laugh,"" Robert whispered, his voice rough, shredded from disuse. ""They still dance. They pretend it didn’t happen.""

Maria stopped a few feet away, close enough to see the scars time had carved into him, the way his shoulders sagged under invisible weights.

""They didn’t forget your children,"" she said softly. ""They forgot how to show it.""

Robert’s lip trembled. His grip on the photograph tightened.

""Emma loved the rain,"" he said, as if to himself. ""Samuel... he hummed when he drew. No one remembers that.""

""I do,"" Maria said.

The words cracked something inside him. His arms slackened. His body seemed to shrink. He looked down at the children—their heads drooping in the cold—and then, finally, he let the switch fall. It hit the dirt with a soft, hollow thud.

Robert Hayes sank to his knees, folding into himself like a man kneeling at an altar. The officers moved in then—slowly, carefully. No shouting. No violence. They cuffed him gently, almost reverently, as if recognizing they were not capturing a monster, but burying a broken father.

As they led him past Maria, he turned his head slightly. His voice, when it came, was low enough that only she could hear.

""I killed most of them,"" he said.

Not all. Most.

The word cut deeper than any weapon.

Robert hadn’t acted alone.

And Halston’s nightmare was far from over.

# Chapter 9: Broken Threads

Two weeks after Robert Hayes was locked behind steel bars, another child died.

A girl this time. Found floating face down in a retention pond behind Halston Middle School. Her sneakers were placed neatly beside her backpack, the zipper closed, her lunch still inside untouched. There were no signs of a struggle. No bruises. No cries for help. Just the stillness of the water swallowing another small life.

Maria Vance stood in the rain at the pond’s edge, her hands balled into fists in her coat pockets. She watched as divers hauled the girl’s body out under a gray, broken sky. Every instinct in her screamed against the easy explanation being whispered around her: accident. Tragedy. Bad luck.

But Maria knew better.

Robert Hayes was sealed away, his world reduced to a cell barely wide enough to stretch his arms. No visitors. No phone calls. No letters. And still—the dying continued.

Someone else was carrying the flame now.

She returned to her office late that night and faced the wall of photographs and maps. Not as a detective. Not even as a protector. As a mourner. Someone who had lost, and who understood the ache that demanded action, no matter the cost.

This wasn’t about Robert anymore. It was about everyone he had touched.

She didn’t trace the victims this time. She traced the helpers.

The janitor who had locked the wrong fire exit during the Christmas pageant. The administrator who had quietly reassigned field trip groups. The bus driver who had closed the doors before the last child could climb aboard.

Ordinary people. Invisible hands.

Maria started digging.

Brian Teller cracked first. She approached him without backup, without even her badge displayed. Just a quiet conversation at his kitchen table. She asked about the fire door. His fingers trembled around his coffee cup. She asked about the night of the pageant. He looked away.

Then she mentioned his son. The boy with asthma.

Brian broke like a rotted beam.

""They sent me a photo,"" he whispered. ""It showed a red circle around his chest... around his lungs.""

He thought it was a prank at first. A cruel joke. He hadn’t meant for anyone to get hurt. But Robert had known exactly where to cut.

Linda Moore came next. She was waiting in the empty school office when Maria arrived, staring blankly at the playground beyond the frosted windows.

""I didn’t want anyone to die,"" Linda said before Maria could even speak. ""They sent me a picture of my niece. Sleeping. In her bed. I just... I thought if I moved a name, it would be harmless.""

Harold Knox—the bus driver—took the longest. He didn’t speak at all when Maria placed the envelope on the table between them. The photos. The nails. The hymn sheet with the red slash across it.

His hands shook. His shoulders sagged.

""I thought it would end,"" he said finally. ""I thought if I did what they asked, it would be over.""

Maria said nothing. She didn’t need to. Because she understood something that terrified her.

Robert Hayes hadn’t needed to kill with his own hands.

He had taught grief how to move from person to person, like a contagion. He had taught fear how to whisper in the ears of desperate mothers, exhausted fathers, terrified guardians. He had taught ordinary people to become monsters in the name of love.

That night, Maria rebuilt her board one last time.

Not a network of victims. But of mourners. Of conspirators. Of grief-stricken souls trapped between guilt and survival.

She traced red string from each accomplice, not to Robert, but to the acts they committed—small acts, each just a hair’s breadth from excusable, from forgivable, until they weren’t.

At the center of the new web wasn’t a man anymore. It was a wound.

Robert Hayes had planted something that would not die with him. It had learned to spread.

It had learned to live.

And it was still growing.

# Chapter 10: Ashes in the Wind

Robert Hayes was gone—a hollow man locked away behind glass and concrete, his name recorded in a courthouse ledger no one cared to read twice. His trial was short, his sentencing swift. Life without parole. No outbursts. No apologies.

And yet, Halston didn’t recover.

The news cameras packed up and left. The vigil candles guttered and drowned in rain. The teddy bears and faded flowers piled at playground fences decayed beneath early snows. A few hollow speeches were made about resilience, about healing, about moving forward.

But fear had taken root deeper than grief ever could.

Children walked to school two by two, their hands clenched white-knuckled. Parents trailed behind them, glancing over their shoulders at every rustle of leaves, every parked car. Churches stayed half-empty, pews gathering dust. Christmas decorations blinked dimly behind barred windows. Laughter, when it came, sounded thin and brittle.

Maria Vance saw it everywhere. In the way playgrounds sat deserted even on sunny days. In the way neighbors no longer trusted each other with their children. In the way hope had been packed away with the last of the holiday lights, perhaps forever.

And still, the messages came.

No more crude threats. No more photographs. Just notes now—typed, anonymous, slipped under doors or taped to mailbox flags. Simple messages.

""We’re still here."" ""She still dreams of water, doesn’t she?"" ""You can’t save them all.""

Maria sat alone most evenings at Miller Park, sipping cold coffee as the swings moved listlessly in the wind. She watched a rusted carousel creak in slow, aching turns. She watched the ghost of what Halston used to be.

And she understood, bitterly, that Robert Hayes had won something no prison walls could take away. He had planted fear not in the hearts of individuals, but in the soil of the town itself. It bloomed every day, fed by memory and absence.

He had turned grief into a weapon. And he had taught others how to wield it.

Halston wore its fear like an old, threadbare coat now—something familiar and heavy and impossible to shed.

Maria kept working. She kept pulling at threads, reopening old files, retracing old paths. She chased shadows. She chased half-remembered names. She chased whispers of whispers, knowing most of it would never lead anywhere clean.

Because Robert hadn’t needed to give orders anymore.

He had shown them how.

How to wound without touching. How to kill without a sound. How to turn love itself into a noose.

Maria walked the town at night sometimes, past shuttered shops, past homes with blacked-out windows, past a burned tool shed someone had once set ablaze just because it “looked wrong.” Every porch light flickering behind a curtain. Every father standing a little too long at the window after putting his children to bed. Every mother who locked every door twice, even during the day.

This was the new Halston.

Not a place. A wound.

The final note came on a Tuesday morning. No envelope. Just a sheet of paper taped to Maria’s front door, the words typed carefully, the ink barely dry.

""You can’t save them all.""

Maria stood barefoot on the porch, the snow biting up through her skin, and stared at the note until the cold seeped into her bones. Then she struck a match, holding it to the paper until it curled black and drifted apart into the wind.

Ashes in the snow.

She watched the last of it vanish into the pale morning light.

And whispered to the empty, listening town:

""Maybe not. But I can damn well try.""

Just to quickly summarize my parent is abusive towards me, tells me where I can and can’t go, what I can and can’t do. They’ve yelled at me, called me names, and have a lot of put downs to me. 

Looking at the items they gave me, makes me feel bad. 😞 I can’t even cook without thinking half my stuff is theirs. I went to make coffee, and my coffee pot is broken, and the coffee is even the type they got me, and the mug I use is from their wife who calls me fat and lazy, and puts me down. 

I just laid down, on the second hand sofa, on their old used out pillows, and I literally feel so depressed. Then I remembered Reddit. 

Am I crazy for feeling so badly towards the items they have given me? Is this normal to have memories towards a coffee pot and a mug? Like my feelings are actually hurt. 

I’m not going to leave the apartment, or throw anything away, because I literally don’t have the money too. But can anyone else sympathize with me this is draining? 

I feel this need to throw all my stuff away and be done with their presence in my life. Sadly, this isn’t an option until I graduate college.

We’ve all seen it: real-life run clubs are booming: Australia, United States, Europe, finally in Germany (late to the party). Whether it’s your local weekly 5K crew or a brand-backed global movement, group runs are *everywhere*. And that’s a good thing in my opinion: it means running is more social, inclusive, and accessible than ever. Our new healthy third place to connect, make new friends or find real love.

But here’s my take: if you’re starting (or running) a club and think pace, “good vibes,” and post-run coffee are enough to make you stand out, you’re already behind. 

It’s no longer about just showing up. The baseline has shifted. Here in Munich there are more than 50+ run clubs. Many are small, invisible on Strava and Instagram, in the shadow of the big ones. For run club seekers, the filters are simply non-existent to quickly decide if it's for me. Some clubs want money, others are free. Some focus more on performance, others on social.  
  
Community is still core, but the most successful clubs in 2025 are doing more. They're creating experiences, offering value beyond the run, and giving people a reason to come back week after week.

What does innovation look like for a run club?

* **Creative formats**: Think themed runs, storytelling routes, relay adventures, or even hybrid events (run + volunteer, run + workshop, etc.). The Sydney Run Club pulled off a pretty awesome collab for the *Mission: Impossible* movie launch! Seriously cool stuff.
* **Meaningful partnerships**: Local businesses, wellness pros, coaches, shoe brands, build an ecosystem, not just a schedule. Partner with other run, cycling, social clubs to build a shared club house for ""premium members"". 
* **Digital touchpoints**: Newsletters, mini podcasts, training challenges on Strava, create community even between runs.
* **Inclusivity with intention**: Not just “everyone welcome,” but actually designing formats that meet people at different fitness levels, backgrounds, and comfort zones. Maybe just one for pensioners, for mothers, singles, internationals, for career-orientated people, entrepreneurs.

The real challenge in my opinion? Reaching and activating the people (target group) fast, iterate fast and find a ""run club community fit"". And yes, local visibility and proximity matter more than ever. Most people won’t commute 45 minutes across the city just to run for an hour. We’re in a golden era of run culture, but with growth comes saturation and saturation breeds sameness. And sameness gets ignored. The clubs that last won’t be the biggest or fastest, they’ll be the ones that keep evolving.

Tell us what place you think deserves some love and what you love about them. what should we order when we go? I’ll post my list below. Let’s hear yours too!

Antojitos Mexicanos
They just opened in Karns and are easily the most authentic Mexican food in town. As someone with a half-Mexican family, this is the closest you’ll get to true Mexican home cooking in Knoxville. The lengua tacos, pozole, and pupusas are absolutely amazing. They also sell goods from a Mexican bakery. It’s run by the mom, dad, and kids—Bob’s Burgers style—and they are all super nice.

Turkish Deli
The kindest couple run this place. They once gave me free baklava just to be nice. Their doner wrap is absolutely amazing, and the Salton’s platter is unlike any Middle Eastern food you’ve likely tried.


Sticky Rice Cafe
This is my favorite restaurant in Knoxville and they are absolutely killing it. The family that runs it are super awesome and the food is next level and really unique. Be brave and give the beef laab a try. It’s definitely not for everyone, but it’s amazing. The desserts are often overlooked but are so good.

T Ralphs
Located inside Kerns Food Hall, this spot serves some of the best smashburgers in Knoxville. The fries are awesome and perfectly complement their burgers.

Egyptian Taste
A wonderful food truck with a super unique menu. They serve delicious kebabs and a refreshing hibiscus drink. You can also try Egypt’s national dish, koshari, which is hard to find anywhere else locally.

Fai Thai
The family that runs it are truly wonderful people. They source most of their ingredients from local farms, and it shows in the quality of the food. The Vietnamese coffee is amazing. You can’t go wrong with the pad Thai, but their curry and khao soi are also standouts. They also serve the best crab rangoons in Knoxville!



Dia De 
I know the owners personally and they’re super chill people who put an insane amount of time and effort into sourcing quality ingredients, developing original recipes, and preparing everything in-house. It’s really cool to have a fresh, creative New Mexican restaurant like this in Knoxville. Their birria is a spectacular, and the whole menu blends together so well. They were recently nominated for Restaurant of the Year, so if you’ve been and think they deserve it, make sure to vote for them.

Angry Dumpling
Home to the best bao in town. They are mostly known as a boba place but they offer a wide range of Taiwanese dishes you won’t find elsewhere in Knoxville. The owner is incredibly friendly and welcoming.


Adopo Pizza
Authentic wood-fired Neapolitan pizza made with sourd. Cozy atmosphere, house-made gelato, and reasonable prices make it one of the best dine-in spots in town.

East Japanese Restaurant
The service can be slow and is the main reason for some of the bad reviews, but the food is worth it. They serve some of the most traditional Japanese dishes in town. The pork katsu curry and ramen are especially good and hard to find made this authentically elsewhere in Knoxville.

Stock & Barrel
You probably already know how great they are. I just want to appreciate them for keeping their prices low. At $13 to $15, their burgers are an excellent deal for the quality you get. Try the duck fat fries!

Chapulines
They're located in Alcoa, but absolutely worth the drive. This is authentic Southern California-style Mexican food—speaking as someone who’s lived there. The al pastor is top-tier, and the battered carne asada fries are something you won’t find anywhere else around here.

Elidio’s Pizza
My favorite pizza in town and one of the most affordable compared to other spots in the area. Easily the most authentic NYC-style pizza in Knoxville. The owners are very much New Yorkers and you’ll know exactly what I mean when you visit 🤣.

Wild Love
They bake everything meticulously from scratch and serve up elevated pastries with real care. The carrot cake is insane and the morning glory buns are so good.

Good Golly Tamale
A truly overlooked gem that should have a much longer line. They make everything from scratch—even the masa. The chicken tinga tamale is one of the best bites of food you can get in Knoxville.

K Pot
A new spot with a $20 all-you-can-eat hot pot lunch. It’s not just good for Knoxville—the service is outstanding. What makes it unique is that everyone gets their own individual bowl instead of sharing one big group pot.

Asia Kitchen
The best Chinese food in town with a huge menu. The lunch special for duck is about $13 and comes with a good portion of delicious roasted duck. I recommend the chow fun or Szechuan chicken for a flavorful meal.

Bit Burger
I don’t really eat at their location, but they serve Token Bar, which I frequent. Their burgers and tater tots are really good.

Roms House
An awesome place serving up Afghan food—who would’ve thought you could get that in Knoxville? It’s a unique and underrated spot. Definitely try the biryani.

El Jinete Mexican Restaurant
The best classic southern-style Mexican restaurant in town. The servings are generous, everything is grilled up beautifully, and the molcajete is absolutely superb. Great spot for a hearty, satisfying meal.

Spice Hut
A little out of the way in Lenoir City, but totally worth the trip. They have a $20 all-you can eat lunch buffet with a great selection, including lamb dishes and endless naan. The value is crazy. The food is super flavorful. You’ve got to try the mango lassi and the daal.
 
Firebirds 
An awesome place for chicken they put coleslaw on the sandwiches which I personally love!

Tesoro
A new gelato spot downtown that stays open late and might be the only gelato-only shop in Knoxville. Luckily, it’s also very good. Smooth texture, rich flavor, and a great addition to the downtown dessert scene.

Goji Kitchen
An authentic Korean restaurant with a great menu and excellent service. They serve awesome drinks like soju, and many meals come with a generous platter of traditional appetizers. I recommend the beef bulgogi or one of their soups, both are full of flavor and super satisfying.

CM Chicken
My favorite fried chicken in Knoxville. It's Korean style and really unique. Get the onion snow and cheese flavored fried chicken.

Payson Bagel
Right beside remedy coffee they have the kind of bagels that I prefer which is on the soft and chewy side. The bacon egg and cheese is my favorite breakfast sandwich in Knoxville. 

Nick and Js Cafe

1ld2pn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1ld2pn9/hiding_the_relationship_on_social_media/,Hiding the relationship on social media,"Hello, to begin with, I’d like to provide some context.

Two years ago, I \[25M\] started a conversation on Instagram with a girl \[23F\].

We talked for a few days, and on a Sunday, she said to me, ""When are you taking me out for tea?""

I suggested we meet on Monday evening for tea at a local spot in the city, but she said she’d prefer somewhere more private since it was cold at the time and asked if I could pick her up with my car.

I told her that I couldn’t use the car at that time, and then asked if she could pick me up in her car if she wanted to. However, she said she didn’t have her car in the city (we were both in a university town).

In the end, I suggested that, given the circumstances, we meet as initially planned, and she agreed. This happened on the same day, Sunday.

On Monday afternoon, she told me she had a headache and couldn’t go out. She didn’t reschedule or anything. I followed up on Tuesday/Wednesday to see if she felt better, and she said she didn’t. That’s when I realized she didn’t want to meet because I didn’t have a car.

Around two months ago, she replied to one of my stories, and we started talking again. We eventually went on a date, and I brought up my thoughts on what happened two years ago. She told me she was going through a rough time back then, that she had just found out she had diabetes, and that she didn’t feel good about herself. In my opinion, it would have been logical and reasonable for her to tell me that back then, as I would’ve understood, rather than waiting all this time. She also mentioned that she’s had three relationships since then, each lasting several months. Considering that not much time had passed between when we stopped talking and her first relationship, I asked her how she felt okay in those relationships but not with me. She didn’t give me a concrete answer, just said that’s how things were at the time.

I think that if she wanted something with me back then, she would’ve messaged me after she got through her rough period, not jumped into a relationship with someone else. But maybe I’m just overthinking.

There were several things that bothered me during our one-month relationship, but I’ll share one instance and ask for your opinion.

On our first date, after talking for a few hours, she leaned in and kissed me.

I thought it was a bit too soon for such a gesture, but I also felt chemistry, so we kept kissing.

During the first week of our relationship, she invited me to her apartment, and that’s where we made sweet love.

Afterwards, I told her that I’d appreciate it if she posted a story—not necessarily a picture of us with the caption “love of my life,” but maybe just something from a coffee shop or a place we went. She said she didn’t feel like posting anything yet, that it was “too soon, we’ve only been together for a week.”

The following week, she graduated from university, and she told me to post a story with a picture of us, which she would repost. I asked her if, after I posted, she would later complain that it’s “too soon” if I asked her to post something, and she said no, that she’d start posting about us from then on.

The next week, we went to a coffee shop and took a few pictures together. I asked if she wanted to post, and she said she didn’t like how the photos turned out, so she’d post something the next day. But later that evening, she changed her mind and told me she wouldn’t post anything the next day either, saying she didn’t feel like it and that it was still too soon.

I should mention that during the whole month of our relationship, we went out almost daily, and I always paid for everything. She was the type who posted frequently, showing where she was, who she was with, etc.

I let it slide, thinking maybe I was overthinking, even though my close friends—both those in relationships and those who weren’t—told me that something seemed off and that she might be hiding something.

Then, a few days ago, she posted a picture in a car with some friends, and I commented on her story with a heart emoji. Now there’s this new feature where comments on stories can be seen by everyone, not just the person who posted the story.

That’s when the drama started. She asked, “Why did you comment?” and said things like, “You do whatever you want without asking me first.” She claimed she didn’t want to “make things public” yet. But she had only told me before that she didn’t feel like posting anything herself, not that I couldn’t comment. Plus, we had already “gone public” when I posted a story and she reposted it. I pointed this out, but she stuck to her opinion.

She didn’t delete my comment, but later changed her story settings so that only people she followed could comment or see comments. For context, she had 3k followers and followed 500 people.

I told her that what she was doing wasn’t okay, and asked if she had something to hide. She said she didn’t, and if I didn’t believe her, that was my problem. I broke up with her the same day.

I’d like your opinion on this situation. As I mentioned earlier, there were other unpleasant things she did, but this one stuck with me, and I’d like to hear your thoughts.",2,1750103280.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

I haven't been on in a while, and I feel like I owe some people an update so here goes. Fair warning, this is a lot: 

Since last time I (22m) posted on Reddit, I've managed to procure a driver's license, a separate college bank account from my parents, a Robinhood investment account, and a few other resources. Life has been slowly getting better. I'm still doing college from home, still don't have a real job, still don't have a car, but I graduate next Spring so hallelujah. 

The drama from me confronting my parents largely passed after I sort of had a mental breakdown around that time and they backed off. Not long after, they asked if I would be interested in attending a student retreat at Summit Ministries (They're a Christian organization that does apologetics stuff) for two weeks, to which I agreed just so I could get away. Unfortunately I had to pay for it myself out of pocket but whatever. 

While there, I never felt so at home before. Everyone was extremely friendly, and I actually got to talk to people my age. I grew up a pastor's kid. I grew up working IN the church, but I'd never actually had Christian minister people genuinely try to get to know me as a person. There was a small groups leader who took me out for coffee alone JUST so he could figure out what was going on in my life. 

I genuinely cried in the middle of that random cafe. No one had actually seen me and asked me what was going on before. I told him I was so messed up. Since around fourteen I have really wrestled with homosexuality and gay porn. That was a secret I had kept to myself for 7 years straight. I grew up in church. I knew that stuff was wrong. I never told a pastor, my friends or siblings, or my parents who were my youth pastors for a good while. I was a pastor's kid, and there was a family reputation to maintain. I never trusted anyone with that secret because I was horrified of being rejected by the Christian community. 

To my surprise, I wasn't judged by the small group leader, or any of the people I talked to there. I felt like a freak and a fake Christian for so long because no one ever talked about this stuff, but instead I was told that sexual purity was something a LOT of guys at that place have struggled with. Since going I've been almost a year off porn, and while I'm still trying to break some sinful habits, I have a bunch of friends from there I keep in regular contact with who keep me sane. 

The people at Summit said I should tell my parents what was going on and essentially “come out of the closet.” I was terrified, but I did it. My parents didn't throw me out or call me a f\*g. Instead they helped me dumb down my phone (removing YT and Google) and install Covenant Eyes. It kinda sucks since I've lost more privacy but it has helped greatly. 

Everything was chill for about 4-5 months. Parents were chill, school was alright…until it wasn't… 

I found a pastor at a different church that I really like. The other young adults there are very friendly, and they are very open about their struggles and praying for one another. The pastor actually asked if I would like to lead a breakout group. I wanted to say yes, but I felt like I should let him know where I was at spiritually right now. Told my parents I want to speak with the pastor privately, and they went nuts. They said I should basically never speak of my struggles to anyone. Not pastors, not friends, not even my siblings. They said if I did that doing so would be a “deal breaker” for them. 

Okay, whatever. I declined the pastor’s offer and kept to myself. 

Several weeks later I received a phone call from a friend I met at Summit around March. They asked if I would like to apply to work a Christian Summer camp up in Colorado called “Eagle Lakes Camps.” I LOVED the idea and told my parents about it. I immediately applied even though my parents didn't like the idea. I did my very first job interview at 21 all by myself, by some miracle managed to get references from friends and churches/non-profits I had gone to years prior, and I got a job offer! Pay was meh (only like $350 every two weeks) but I got free room/board and transportation the entire time I was there. 

Told my parents I got a job offer and I was ready to pay for my plane ticket with my own cash, and they went freaking ballistic. 

My mother called me a dumbass, a sex addict, and a HOST of other names because I “wasn't ready” to work at this Christian Summer camp because I “wasn't free yet” from homosexual desires. She even went so far as to claim I might go touching kids because I am apparently a pervert. My father said I was arrogant and prideful for thinking I was right and they were wrong. Lots of yelling and death glares. They literally think I am being oppressed by an incubus sex demon that gives me wet dreams. Mind you, both of these people are/have been Christian ministers…

They basically said I was unfit to work at that camp currently because I still struggle with this stuff, only for them to put me ON STAGE at a church a few weeks later to play instruments for worship during service. I am freaking livid at the blatant hypocrisy.

At this point I'm kind of just done. I called the pastor and a couple friends and told them everything that was going on. They all agree I need to leave soon, so I'm currently plotting to apply to that summer camp again after I graduate next Spring. I don't care if my parents like it or not. If things don't change I'm not coming back.

1ld2lqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/exorthodox/comments/1ld2lqy/can_i_be_exorthodox_if_perhaps_i_was_never/,"Can I be ExOrthodox if, perhaps, I was never Orthodox to begin with? (a very long post)","This is going to be long (too long) and perhaps unworthy of reading (let alone writing) but one feels mightily compelled on various occasions. (also, for what its worth, I should begin by mentioning that I had a Reddit not too long ago but deleted it when it appeared some people I didn't want to know about it found it). 

Many, many moons ago, as a teenager during the heady days of 9/11 and George W. Bush I became a militant atheist. I liked to pretend, at the time, that I knew everything that was worth knowing, that all spirituality and all religious praxis was utter bullshit, and that my reasons for becoming an atheist (in a completely secular family that never went to church or engaged in any sort of communal ritual or worship) were not simply a tired form of materialistic rebellion and reactionary hatred but a true ""search for truth."" (actually, in the long view, it was)

After a while, especially being one enamored with art, literature, beauty, and starting to just barely peek into works of philosophy my commitment to rabid anti-theism began to wane. It simply became so frustratingly tiresome to police my own thought processes, to tell myself that there could not possibly ever be a higher meaning (as such was somehow tantamount to totalitarian repression), and that all which mattered was my individual identity and puny intellectual posturing. 

And I was the sort of atheist who REALLY took it seriously. I may have not read them very well BUT I read the Bible, and the Quran, and other various works of religious literature. I studied apologetics both for and against various strains of religious thought, and while I took no issue with having a good time I also forced myself to act as a sort of evangelist for ""non-faith."" I was a ""debate-you, bro"" who was actually pretty good at being an asshole. 

Finally...it was too much. I become something like an agnostic, lived in another country with a total foreign culture for a year, and got into graduate school for a Master of Fine Arts degree. And it was in this period of ""hibernation,"" that, one day alone at home (a July afternoon where both roommates were away and I was off work) I decided to read the KJV Gospel of John in the living room which was itself not the oddest impulse (I then, and to this day, still feel that the Gospel According to John to be one of the most compelling works of world literature). 

I recall reading it and thinking ""hmmm...somehow its so beautiful...too bad it's all bullshit!"" But, only a few minutes later I had the sensation of being not watched but ""seen,"" and that there was a PRESENCE in the room, and that I was and never had been truly alone. It was somewhat frightening yet also uncannily comforting but, most importantly, it was TRUTH. I sat on a couch, facing the front door, and I saw that the front door was...suffused with green light...that the light was inviting me...and there was a voice saying ""open the door...open the door...open the door...""

My life was irrevocably transformed at that moment yet...it was also a ""home coming."" Somehow I had always KNOWN that the world was this FULL and WIDE and SATURATED with the LOVE of its CREATOR and that everything I'd done and been, even in opposition to God, was what had brought me TO HIM.

I soon joined a small, young-restless-reformed non-denom church which met in a middle school auditorium and went through the totally bizarre process of becoming a ""Christian"" wherein a) I started a graduate school program wherein I was the only person who went to church and b) I was also spending a ton of time with people my age or younger who had done things like watched ""veggie tales"" and had never even thought about taking a puff of a joint or having sex before marriage. This was, in itself, not bad and taught me much yet almost immediately there were problems. I believe I was attracted to the explanatory power of Calvinism because, being just recently an atheist, I needed that utterly rigid and logic-chopping structure to explain WHY I had ""been saved"" the way I was. And yet...it was all so narrow, and ugly, and downright allergic to mystery. I knew I couldn't stay in this ""tradition"" forever. I also learned that if someone wanted my ""testimony,"" they meant a story of how shitty a person I was before, how much I hated my past but NOT my actual spiritual experiences (that always gave them the willies). 

At one point, in a new city and at my next Calvinist church I ended up simply disbelieving almost all of the major doctrines and becoming very much a sub-rosa universalist (I was reading much David Bentley Hart) who was sliding towards Perennialism and knew to ""hide"" most of my actual theology and reading from others. I recall once being ""caught"" by my pastor reading a somewhat silly and absurdly abridged Penguin Classics edition of the Rig Veda and when I mentioned that ""it contained some very real truths about the nature of God and the World"" he told me ""Hey, you can get peanuts from a turd but why not just buy a can of Planters?"" 

Finally, no longer able to abide yet ANOTHER sermon about God outright condemning his Son because of how much he absolutely fucking HATED a sinner like me I stopped going to Church. I soon learned that the Eastern Orthodox Church had what appeared to be the clearest doctrinal version of Christus Victor I'd yet heard while also embracing mystery, the mystical life/path, and that the Church itself was the GATEWAY into a fuller eternity. Oddly enough, when I started going to an OCA parish in my city I, without meaning to do this, brought probably 25 more converts with me from my old Reformed church. 

Eventually I was catechized, baptized, and chrismated and many from my same church came along right after...I was almost seen...weirdly...as something like the ""new convert Sherpa"" not because of any excessive piety but simply because in a tiny parish I was the first of a fairly significant wave of prot-converts who were all trickling out of the same church. 

Like many of you I recall being, at first, utterly in love with everything Orthodox and kept up with fasting, and confession, and observance, and all those things which did annoy me (the Jay Dyerites, the Ortho-Karens who would have an aneurism if you used the wrong shape of plate during Coffee Hour on the Feast of John the Baptist, the homilies which were literally just 15 minute blocks of being told ""fast, and pray, like today's saint"") were just ""minor burdens."" 

But sooner than I would have ever thought it all became so apparent to me. I learned that it wasn't simply the most tricked-out pseudo-Russian peasant LARPERS in our Parish who were inimical to what I knew was Love and Truth but much of the Church entire! A few examples that we all have seen will suffice--

\*) my OCA parish is in a desert wherein it is very dry. I remember being told one had to ""fast from all things"" before communion but I would still have a glass of water when I woke up otherwise I couldn't even speak...yet I recall at least one parishoner, a wonderful but much older woman, telling me, apropos of nothing, how she had asked our priest if it was ""OK"" for her to drink a glass of water during ""Sundays in summer""

\*) David Bentley Hart, Sergius Bulgakov, Origen of Alexandria, Rene Guenon, (and the list goes on and on) were absolutely NOT to be read or discussed

\*) ""the true Theologian is one who prays so maybe you should read less theology and pray more?""

\*) being told that Seraphim Rose was THE authority on EVERYTHING from the 20th century (""our last Church Father"" I heard someone say) and then reading works which were either totally underwhelming (Nihilism), totally absurd (Orthodoxy and the Religion of the Future), rife with horrible scholarship and inaccuracies (The Orthodox Survival Course), or just plain spiritually abusive and idiotic (The Soul After Death)

\*) realizing that, with very few exceptions like Saint Maria of Paris most of the EA saints are often the most dull, uninteresting, and often times wicked people around (the canonization of Saint Justinian alone PROVES that Orthodoxy teaches Universal Salvation)

\*) being told that Saint Francis, Saint John of the Cross, Saint Teresa of Avila (et cetera) were all demon-possessed lunatics suffering from Prelast 

\*) being told that I really need to believe literally EVERYTHING a work of poorly written pious literature has to say about some 20th century Eastern European or Greek monastic AND that there long, long, long lists of dog shit maxims are ""profound"" and ""beautiful""

\*) ""you know that universal salvation is just a theologumenon,  at best, right! also, why are you learning Latin and not Slavonic?""

\*) being told that I was buying too many icons which were not ""traditional"" and also that it was wrong to have a small image of Rembrandt's The Return of the Prodigal Son on my icon wall despite it being the single greatest work of religious art in all human history (and I mean that)

\*) ""yes, those members of our parish who literally do nothing but criticize you, interrupt you will you are praying the Jesus Prayer before service starts by telling you it's wrong to sit on the benches against the wall with your legs crossed, and who spend almost the entire 2 and a half hours giving you looks of disapproval because you have ear gauges...well...it's wrong to ever be honest with them and consider that, as an act of ascetic repentance you just put it with their bullshit!"" 

\*) ""you need to be praying the Jesus prayer ALL THE TIME but, also, you are NOT a MONK! and you need fast perfect but, also, you are NOT a MONK! and you need to use the examples of the Saints and the Fathers and GRIEVE over your sin but also, you are NOT a MONK!""

\*) ""why would you ever pray a rosary?!""

I could go on and, the truth is, having lurked without a Reddit account on this subreddit for quite some time I know many of you have had far, far worse stories and experiences. At the end of the day the disappointment I have centers around some bitter truths, namely, that the Church isn't really a hospital but remains a courtroom, that you really DO have to appease God with your works, that all of the great theology which denies absolute evils like penal substitutionary atonement is replaced with a ""folk"" theology where demons are literally more powerful than God, and that Jesus actually HATES YOU and that DREAD DAY OF JUDGEMENT IS COMING, BABY!

I used to think that the Eastern Orthodox Church was like a great feast and what it meant ""to be saved"" was to get yourself able to partake of the meat and the drink. In other words, you are not ""working"" for your salvation but how can you enjoy a glass of wine if you refuse to swallow?

At it's highest that is what the Church should be. It is, alas, not, and not even in the sense of being an imperfect human institution. I mean...that analogy is so far off the mark it isn't even funny. 

To truly summarize it all, my life spiritually (which is the most important part of life) has been a journey from narrowness to broadness, from scarcity to fullness, from the closed to the open. At this point I have no time or patience with anything that refuses to recognize that Ontological Plentitude IS God, and that the Infinite has no business being sullied by pietistic drivel or that FEAR has any place in one's relationship with God. 

To that end I never really WAS nor can BE an Orthodox Christian insofar as the EO Church, despite better graphics and marketing, is still wedded to an uncompromising narrowness of faith and experience. 

It's also gotten weirder in that, for the last few years, I have become an occultist who still visits liturgy fairly frequently and, while keeping my real spiritual side ""secret"" has not been easy, it has also meant that I've learned far, far, far more about the true nature of God than I ever have AND I've simply thrown scrupulousness out the fucking window. It is AMAZING how much easier and enjoyable a Divine Liturgy is WHEN you no longer feel that you ""need"" to be there and when you outright tell people to fuck off and mind their own business (in a manner of speaking), and when you can augment spiritual experience WITHOUT having to rely upon a priest to do such for you. 

So, the moral of this very long, rambling, and drawn out account is that if the Eastern Orthodox Church is NARROWING your experience of the INFINITE, you need put the INFINITE first. For some that will mean abandoning it all in toto. For others it might mean something even more drastic (I can understand how this Church creates atheists). 

For me, ironically (and at the moment) it means I feel more free and full during Liturgy BECAUSE I no longer ""have"" to be there. At some point I'll probably be found out, doxxed to my priest, and excommunicated for a genuine lack of repentance. And that is going to be OK. I had to go through ALL of these things anyway.

1ld2gmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1ld2gmq/can_anyone_relate/,Can anyone relate?,"Background info: 23F semi-recently diagnosed borderline personality disorder. 

Recently I’ve been spiraling, and I try to journal when things get really bad. My mom found this entry when she came to my apartment to let my dog out for me. I had left it open on my coffee table without realizing and she just happened to see it. She called me crying asking if this is really how my life has been, I told her yes but I never wanted her to feel bad about it. She told me she feels guilty because I’ve been struggling and she didn’t know it. I told her I made it a point for her not to know, because I knew her empathy couldn’t take it. Now I feel bad for even writing it. She’s not upset with me, she offered to help me find a good therapist and she is the most supportive mother I could’ve had. Can anyone relate to suffering in silence to spare the ones who love us most? How do people with our diagnosis walk the line between total trauma dumping and simply reaching out for a shoulder to cry on? That seems to be one of the areas I struggle in, I either tell people EVERYTHING or nothing at all and I recognize that’s not fair to my loved ones who are just trying their best to be supportive. 

(Below is the entry she found last night…)

""A soul-crushing emptiness so isolating, that it makes the next life look like a warm embrace."" 

All my life, at my core, I have felt alone. That pitting, gut-wrenching lonliness is the only thing that never truly leaves me. My family tries to be present in my life, but they only know what I've actually admitted to them. They dont know that every moment I spend by myself feels like an eternity of emotional torture. They dont know how much I obsess over building and maintaining relationships, even to the point of manipulating people to stay present in my life. They dont know that sometimes the lonliness is so intense that it causes physical pain which feels like someone ripping my heart and lungs out of my chest with a barbed wire glove. They dont know that I truly do not have intentions to live once Lady passes away. They do know I have issues with my mental health, but they dont have the slightest clue how bad things really are and how bad they have always been. Part ot me wants to tell them, to get help and feel better, but I dont want to be labeled as a “problem"" in my family, personal life, or at work.
I've always been the girl who could handle anything, who always gets back up after being knocked down, the one nobody had to worry about. The ""strong one"". When my issues would show a little bit, I would be labeled ""dramatic"" or just simply punished/reprimanded for my words or actions. Even when I was put in therapy due to my parents divorce at age 7, the focus of those sessions was surface level, and I hide my real issues well, so nobody ever bothered to look deeper, to understand me, to *really* listen to me.
My childhood home held so much love, and I did make a good amount of friends, but at the end of the day it was always just me, alone, in that bedroom.",0,1750102688.0,BPD,0,0.5,False

1ld2amu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1ld2amu/cardinal_scents_reviews_all_in_edp_format/,"Cardinal Scents Reviews, All In EDP Format","Purchased: May 19

Shipped: May 28

Arrived: June 4; sat in pre-shipment for SOOO long!!!



Oh, this house. This was really not something I needed, in the sense of having probably more than enough samples. :). But these scents just kept knocking about in my head until I went ahead and gave in. And I'm so glad I did. Processing was in the stated TAT, though it sat in pre-shipment for about a week. I blame USPS for that.

I got two Build your Own Sample trios, and packaging was immaculate. Everything was wrapped and wrapped again, and the boxes the samples came in were so cute! Samples were in little vials with no caps, nestled by trio into their own individual boxes, and the samples themselves were wrapped individually in paper as well. I'd heard this house was super generous with freebies, so I was looking forward to expanding my horizons, but sadly, no freebie this time. Ah well. That just means more sampling is in my future!

As noted, all samples are in EDP



Lunar Conspiracy: pink pepper, white peony, grey amber, jack pine.

First impressions: On paper and teensiest skin spritz, I got something sharp for sure, I guess the pine. But also, something sweet and fruity? I guess the peony here, but on my skin, it almost reminded me of like, pineapple? Passionfruit? But as it dries, it kinda veers into a sharp cleaning product place. I was really hoping to like this one. Will hear it out, let it rest. But oh, I don't know. This was definitely one I picked for notes. My partner does not like it at all.

I guess I must say that I suppose I wasn't sure what I was looking for here. I wasn't too familiar with two out of four notes, so maybe I put my trust in the peonies and the pink pepper to carry it through and make a sort of skin-like musk with, like, a slightly piney undertone? I don't know. But I accept that that's absolutely on me. On an all-day wear, the thing that stuck around the most was that sharp, I guess pine, smell. Didn't change all that much from my first impression. On the drydown, I find that the notes soften up a little bit into what I envisioned, but that sharpness is still the loudest. This time, I was okay with the scent being gone after two to three hours.



Midnight Laundry: crushed violets, laundry detergent, cedar paneling, skin musk.

First Impressions: Oh yay. I was hoping I'd like this one, and I very much do. It's a burst of warm dryer sheets. I'm worried that as it dries though, it'll have kind of a room air freshener vibe instead of staying in that clean linens, dryer sheets place. I loved it on first spritz, both on paper and my skin. But as I write this, I can't get, like, Glade bathroom spray out of my head, and now, that's all I smell. Argh. Okay. If I breathe in deep enough, I'm getting less bathroom spray and more, like, vintage perfume vibes. Maybe a little masc leaning on me.

When I wore this the whole day, sadly, it was gone after about two to three hours. I got less of that weird old-time room spray vibe that I was getting, but I definitely love that dryer sheet burst at the opening a little more than that drydown. I'm wondering if violets maybe just aren't my thing? Wondering if I just associate them with, like, masc-leaning cologne. I think that this sample would mix really well with my partner''s Pillow Fort though. that would create a cozy, warm scent for him.



Original Sin: crisp red apple, fig leaf, skin musk, dust of the earth.

First Impressions: YUM!!! This one wasn't even in my original thought rotation, and I rotated and thought hard. But I am so happy I did this. I'm not sure why, but as I go on my Indie journey, apple was one of the first notes I glommed onto to try from various houses to see how they'd play. It seems to do well on my skin. It's not too heavy, and carries with it a sort of fresh on-the-breeze vibe that I seem to like. So far, I like everything about this, from start to finish. Not a ton of change from paper to skin. Maybe I get a bit of a richer apple as it dries. Nothing particularly juicy about this either, which may be a deal breaker for some. But apparently, I'll take apple how I get it. LOL.

Now, I did wear this on the first day, and it was lovely. Gentle apple with a, like, musty, dusty? No. Something similar drydown. But oh, it just didn't last too long. Future wears tell me that this is less apple-y and more, like, dust? That Earth note is more pronounced on me than the apple. In this case, I don't altogether hate it. It's kind of Earthy dusty, but in a good way. I still get apple, but it's so well-balanced with that dust smell that you can never really quite say it's JUST apple. I like this. I'm not sure I need, like, more of it, but, you know, I wouldn't be mad at it either. I will say, though, that it lasted so well until I went out and ran some errands. I could no longer really smell it while I was out, and certainly not when I got home.



Swan Princess: wild spearmint, blue eucalyptus, fir balsam, ambrette seed musk.

This was on my original rotation, but I almost didn't get it when I was narrowing down for just one trio, and, honestly, I'm glad I got a second set. This is lovely, gentle mint. My partner is not such a mint fan, but I am. He was like, you might as well just drip scope onto the back of your hand. Ha. But I think it''s soft mint. There's a perfumey undertone to this, which I personally like. And it's a soft scent overall. I actually sprayed tiny spritzes of Original Sin and Swan Princess on the same hand, just different spots, and, though I can absolutely pick each one out, honestly, I think they'd layer nicely together. I'm sold.

On an all-day wear, I love this. It's still not my partner's favorite, but I really like it. It's soft and, cozy? I don't necessarily know that I'd have described what I get here as mint, but whatever it is, it's soft, yet projects well. My scent bubble is really nice and, like, almost dry. Most people have said this smells cool, and maybe I'm just not nuanced enough to understand what that means on my personal skin, but oh yeah. This may be my favorite. Projection is moderate, but longevity is better than I've seen for these scents so far.



Pillow Fort: Lavender Sugar, Cotton, Amber, Musk

First Impressions: Boy, do I hope this changes on skin. My partner loves lavender, so I thought this would be right up his alley, and I was right. Hurrah. He does seem to like it in the bottle and on paper. But, oof. I'm not mad at lavender, but to me, this smells way too much like Clorox Wipes. That's all I get. We'll have to see how it plays on his skin.

My partner is a weird one. For a good long time, he treated my stepping into Indies with the casual indulgence of the stereotypical, ""She's just into shopping,"" vibe. He associated, and probably still does with most things, Indies with that head shop vibe. Meanwhile, he loves head shops, so I'm not sure what the problem is here. Ha. But only recently, has he started finding things he doesn't actively dislike. And in this case, like I said, I bought this for him. It actually almost didn't make it either when I was looking at getting only one sample set, so I'm glad I went back for it. On his skin, it smells lovely and warm. He called it a ""mature lavender scent,"" and he's not wrong. It layers well, but also works on its own. He's talking about upsizing to an oil rollerball so he can blend it into other scents. So, needless to say, I haven't gotten the chance to try it yet. :). The only down side for him is the longevity. Though the scent does ten to  linger on his clothes, it does dissipate

 after about an hour.



Girl Crush: hazelnut cappuccino, raspberry body spray, pear shampoo, warm skin musk.

I wasn't too sure about this one. I was lured in by the cutesy aesthetic and the artificial fruit notes. Will have to let this one rest, lest it color my overall impression. On paper, all I get is the coffee note. Not entirely ruling it out, but scared, for sure.

I'm so glad I let this one rest. After a few days, this changed dramatically. That coffee note is still there, but only on the top. On first spray, I get a kind of sharp, but oddly gentle coffee note. After not too much time, I start getting more fruity elements. I knew this would be a little artificial smelling, but I didn't mind that. I grew up in the early aughts, so I''m all about that Victoria's Secret Lovespell, that Bath&Bodyworks fruit spray. This does kind of remind me of that, but like, more... lip glossy? I don't know. On me, it kind of smells like shimmering lip gloss. Weirdly, I don't hate it. The coffee note is still there, just more as an undertone to me. My partner said he could detect it kind of lingering though, more than I could. Then, he said, ""Smells like 'hot girl purse' in the summer. That melding of scents when you, a young, attractive girl, opens her purse after she's been hanging out for a while. You get the leather of the purse, the slightly melted lipstick, or gloss, maybe a hint of mints that are in there, and a bit of 'hand sanni.'"" I'm not really sure I'm getting all that, but that's why I get second opinions. Haha. I could smell it in my own scent cloud well into my day for sure.



Overall, what I'm learning about this house is that the scents are very pretty. Soft and gentle, well-blended. Everything I smelled was lovely, with elements of things I loved even in the ones that I didn't need again. I work from home, so can spend most of my days not doing too much of much. On those days, these scents really shine. Wear them on busier days, especially in the hot summers of the Southern US, and everything is gone. I do wish longevity on these was a bit better. I had read reviews that mentioned this about the oils, so I was hoping the EDPs would amp some of these, and I'm sure they must have. Having never smelled the oils, I can't speak to that. I wish the EDP bottles had caps on them so the scents could be a little more distinguishable from one another. 

That being said, I think that taking all factors into account, if I want more of these scents, (and I do,) I may spring for the oil rollerballs so I can slather myself. :)",10,1750102297.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

Absolute banger. 50 minutes. Knowledge bomb after knowledge bomb. Watch it if you have the time. Here it is: [https://youtu.be/vgrV9rjqQyA](https://youtu.be/vgrV9rjqQyA)

Turns out... coffee is actually VERY good for you. But a few caveats. I'll get into that below. Some stuff you should know. My notes:

1. Each daily cup of coffee consumed correlates with a **reduction in your epigenetic age by 0.7 to 1 full year**, with three cups reducing accelerated aging risk **by nearly 40%.** So pretty darn good for longevity. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=84s))
2. Drinking dark roast coffee daily correlates with a reduction in **severe DNA double-strand breaks by 23%** (the same genetic damage caused by radiation), significantly reducing cancer risk. I think a pretty common misconception is that coffee increase cancer risk. Not the case. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=84s))
3. Drinking unfiltered coffee like French press or espresso **raises LDL cholesterol by up to 30 mg/dL within weeks.** Filtered brewing methods (including paper-drip, instant, or cold brew) remove this risk. Probably the most important part of the episode. Unfiltered brewing methods (like French press) actually raise your cholesterol. I had no idea. Something about the diterpenes in coffee that don't get filtered out. Better options: Instant coffee (surprising), your standard filtered coffee pot, and pour over with a paper filter. I guess cold brew too. I think another way to think about this.... there's just no reason your morning coffee should be raising your LDL-C. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=961s))
4. Drinking three or more cups of caffeinated coffee daily **reduces Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s risk by 34–37%**. So when it comes to the brain... caffeinated is superior to decaf, by FAR. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=1720s))
5. Drinking **2–4 cups of coffee daily boosts gut production of short-chain fatty acids**. Ok... so here's why that's important. This tightens the gut barrier, reducing inflammation. Also enhances insulin sensitivity. So turns out, coffee is actually amazing for your gut. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=819s))
6. **Adding dairy to coffee reduces immediate antioxidant absorption by 20–30%**, blunting coffee’s rapid cognitive benefits. So if you want the immediate cognitive benefits, best to drink it black. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=2526s))
7. Combining **100–200 mg L-theanine with coffee significantly enhances sustained attention, improves accuracy, and speeds reaction times** through increased GABA and glycine signaling. I think most people know l-theanine calms the caffeine's jitters, but I did NOT know how it kind of amplifies coffee's cognitive benefits. Good stuff. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=2719s))
8. Drinking 2-3 cups of coffee daily **reduces diabetes risk by up to 60%** through AMPK activation. So coffee is elite for metabolic health. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=481s))
9. Each daily cup of coffee you drink is associated with **roughly a 15 to 20% reduction in liver cancer risk, and about a 10% lower risk of endometrial cancer**, with maximum benefits seen around 4-5 cups per day. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=1240s))
10. **95% of coffee samples globally contain mold toxins far below safety limits**—and roasting beans further reduces levels by 70–90%. Oh man... this one is for you Dave Asprey. Guy made a living on freaking people out about mold in coffee. ([timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=2363s))",4,1750102240.0,RhondaPatrick,0,1.0,False

I gently rubbed the puckered, healing flesh of my right arm, feeling the ragged edges of flesh. I sighed softly and flexed my fingers, feeling a slight twinge in my bicep. The doctor had told me that the healing was going well, and that I'd be able to *slowly* start bearing weight on it in a couple more weeks. Just as well, since I had every intention of getting back to my workouts, soon.

""Why am I doing this, Cosmo?""

*Ma'am?*

""Meeting him here. By the ocean.""

*Oh! Well, I couldn't say, Angela. Your reasons for meeting whomever ""he"" is are your own. I am not privy to them.*

I sighed and shook my head. ""Thanks, Cosmo.""

*You're welcome, Angela! I am always happy to be of service. Speaking of service, would you like to upgrade your television package? AetherNet is running a special right now! Only nineteen thousand credits per month for the first six months!*

I knew better than to interrupt the advertisement. It would just keep playing. ""No, Cosmo. I don't want to upgrade my television package. Thank you, though.""

*No problem, Angela! Enjoy your coffee.*

I couldn’t remember the last time I'd asked someone out to coffee. Or even *wanted* to. I sat there, listening to the distant roar of the ocean waves as people passed me by on the boardwalk, contemplating this decision. Why *had* I asked Ozzy to coffee? Was it out of some semblance of gratitude? Something *deeper*, perhaps? Certainly, I was thankful that he'd saved my life that day, and that he had stayed with me in the hospital. He didn't have to do that for a complete *stranger*.

And here I was, a stranger to him, asking him out to coffee. I'd flexed some of my managerial strength and pulled his file, just to make sure he wasn't crazy. I'd found quite the opposite, actually. In seven years, he'd only managed to raise his quota by a paltry *five percent*. Most SanRec Techs would double their quota in two years. Not Ozzy. He'd apparently worked *hard* at keeping his quota as low as possible for *seven years*. Quite the feat. He'd never had any incidents, always coming in right at the time he was supposed to, taking his break and his lunch in silence alone, and leaving right at the time his shift was over.

It was honestly incredible that he'd been able to stay under the radar this whole time.

A deep, sonorous voice sounded at my left side. ""Is this seat taken?""

I jolted out of my reverie, the motion causing a twinge in my right arm. Looking up, I saw the face of my rescuer, bathed in the sunlight. His ear-length brown hair fluttered in the wind, and I was struck for a moment by how incredibly *plain* he looked. He *was* tall however, quite a bit taller than my five foot two, and was as slim as nearly everyone I'd ever met. But, there was still *something* about him that I couldn't place, something that pulled at me that I was still trying to define.

""Um, no. Please, sit down, Ozzy."" I smiled up at him, and placed my hand against the dull ache in my arm.

""Is it still bothering you?""

I nodded. ""It's not so bad anymore, but yeah. Sometimes it *really* hurts.""

He gave me a sad smile. ""I understand. Sometimes my fingers itch.""

I watched his eyes take on a faraway glaze. In that moment, I wanted to do nothing more than take that pain away. Instead, I cleared my throat and looked at my phone. ""Have you ever had coffee?""

""Um, no. I've never even given it a second thought. It's always been a little expensive, so I opted to just not.""

I smiled. ""Well, in that case, I'm buying. Don't even *try* to talk me out of it.""

He held up his hands in surrender, and I got a good look at his ruined left hand. He was still wearing an immobilizing brace, but the flesh around his fingers seemed to have healed quite well in the past week. Wait. Hadn't he *picked me up* with that hand?

""Ozzy?""

""Hm?"" He looked scared for some reason.

""When you got me out of the building, didn't you have to, you know, *use* that hand?"" I pointed at the braced hand.

""Oh. Uh... yes?"" His eyes darted around the open area.

""*How*? Your hand was broken, and you were missing three fingers, Ozzy. How did you even have the strength to grip me?""

""I... I just did? I dunno? I just did what I had to."" He tucked his hand under his right arm.

Gingerly, I reached out for it, and he seemed to reluctantly let me hold his braced hand. ""Does the break still hurt?"" I asked softly.

""Um... not really, ma'am. I'm keeping the brace on to make sure I don't hurt it."" I felt him tremble beneath my gaze.

""Angela. Please call me *Angela*, Ozzy. No matter where we are. As far as I'm concerned, you have *earned* that right. I might be a manager, but I'm not your *direct* superior. As such, fraternization cannot be reprimanded. A little bit of good news for you.""

He nodded. ""Well, that's certainly a relief.""

I grinned, glad I had eased his mind. ""So! I'll be starting you off with a simple black coffee.""

""It has colors?""

I laughed. ""Yeah, kind of. Black coffee is just plain coffee. No cream, no sugar, nothing. Just coffee.""

""It can have *sugar*? I've only had sugar a few times in my *life*!""

""Oh, you sweet man. You're in for a *treat* today!""

His face turned crimson and he gently tugged his hand from mine as he smiled and looked at the floor. I punched the order in on my phone, and waited with the awkward, silent man beside me. A moment later, a gray and white delivery drone dropped the order off at our table, and whirred away, the downwash of its six rotors filling the air with the tantalizing aroma of coffee.

Two cups; one tall, the other *extremely* short, sat before us. I took the taller one, and gave Ozzy the shorter of the two. It was really only the size of a single mouthful, but it was enough to give him a taste.

""Go ahead. Just know that it's rather hot. And *bitter.*"" I gingerly sipped mine, relishing the foamy consistency of the milk.

He paused, his cup just barely touching his lips. ""Bitter? I thought you said it had sugar?""

""It *can*. I wanted to make sure you didn't have any kind of reaction to it, first. Some people can't tolerate it well."" I sipped my drink, smiling as the warm brew hit my tongue, sending a wave of pleasure through my body.

He shrugged and sniffed the cup. He slurped at it like a soup, and made a face. ""Ugh. Kind of like battery acid.""

I laughed. That summed it up quite nicely. ""Battery acid, he says. Well, I can't disagree. Not really. That's why I get mine with steamed milk and sugar.""

He smacked his lips. ""Then why drink it at *all*?""

I nodded. I'd had the same reaction years ago. ""Because it'll keep you awake. It gives you energy, Ozzy. For me, it's been almost as much of a lifesaver as *you*."" I took another drink, regarding him over the rim of the cup.

He sat there with a terrified look on his face, and I could see the blood rushing up his neck. ""I didn't do anything special, Angela. I just did what was *right*,"" he said quietly.

I took his uninjured hand in my own. ""That's rare, Oswald Blake. So very, *very* rare in this world.""

He stared at me like a cornered animal. ""I... uh..."" He took a deep, shaky breath and let it out slowly, giving me a whispered thanks.

I squeezed his hand gently. ""You're welcome."" I released his hand and he pulled it into his lap. I sipped at my coffee, feeling my stomach do a flip.

I placed my cup in front of him. ""Would you like to try it with milk and sugar?""

""S-sure."" His trembling hand reached out and he sipped the warm brew. ""Oh. *Oh wow*. And that's just milk and sugar?"" He slid it back.

I nodded. ""Yep.""

""That's pretty good. Say, why do I feel all jittery?""

I laughed, seeing him smile.

""That's what caffeine does, Ozzy. It gives you energy, and for some, it makes them jittery."" I shrugged, having been used to the life-saving brew for years.

""Huh. That's kind of neat."" He held up his hand, which trembled softly, then put it on the table.

""Tell me something, Ozzy. Why did you agree to come get coffee with me?"" I sipped my drink, regarding him over the rim of my cup.

He looked at me, his eyes wide, and I saw the color drain out of his face. With a shaky hand, he picked up his drink and shot it back in one go, wincing at the taste.

""I... uh... Well. I didn't think it would be a bad idea. Meeting with you again. I *was* sort of worried that we might get in trouble for, you know, *mingling* after work hours, but you put that to rest. I guess... Well. Yeah."" I saw the color rise into his cheeks as he clasped his hands in his lap, seeming to withdraw.

""Relax, Ozzy. I won't bite or yell or anything. And yes, I was worried about us getting together after work hours, but I did a hefty amount of research, and found nothing prohibiting it since I'm not your direct supervisor."" I snorted, my drink paused just before my lips. ""Sometimes I wonder why I keep doing it all; just what the point is.""

He smirked and gave a half-hearted chuckle. ""I think if, by this point in your career, you're still wondering *that*, you're lucky. Most everyone else -and until recently, that included *me*\- gave up *long* ago, Angela.""

A chill shot down my spine, and I stopped mid-swig and stared at him. Stared at this man who all but admitted that he found *something* to give him hope. A man who, in a world that did its level best to grind us *all* into dust, found something powerful enough to give him hope. I had to know.

""What..."" My voice came out in a hoarse whisper. I coughed to clear my throat. ""What did you mean by that, Ozzy? That 'until recently, it included you'? What do you mean?""

The color once more drained from his face and he laughed nervously. ""I mean... Well, you. A-and me. We, uh... We went through the thing at the church, see? Yeah, and-and-and we're *healing* from that and we're both getting stronger. Um... different outlooks on things now, right?"" He smiled weakly.

I knew he was lying. How could I *not*? Whatever the truth was, he was either embarrassed by or or terrified I would talk about it. My phone vibrated with a message. I ignored it and was about to open my mouth, when it vibrated again. Irritated, I picked it up and checked it.

*I'm Nova, Ozzy's AI assistant. Ozzy wants you to know that he won't discuss it here in the open. And not now, as he needs to do more thinking.*

Huh. Okay, then. I nodded and smiled at him. ""Yeah... A different outlook after something like *that* would be something worth holding on to. Tell me about it?""",1,1750102202.0,Words_From_Ivor,0,1.0,False

**Angela**

*\[Sunday, March 25th, 5173. A small coffee shop overlooking the ocean\]*

I gently rubbed the puckered, healing flesh of my right arm, feeling the ragged edges of flesh. I sighed softly and flexed my fingers, feeling a slight twinge in my bicep. The doctor had told me that the healing was going well, and that I'd be able to *slowly* start bearing weight on it in a couple more weeks. Just as well, since I had every intention of getting back to my workouts, soon.

""Why am I doing this, Cosmo?""

*Ma'am?*

""Meeting him here. By the ocean.""

*Oh! Well, I couldn't say, Angela. Your reasons for meeting whomever ""he"" is are your own. I am not privy to them.*

I sighed and shook my head. ""Thanks, Cosmo.""

*You're welcome, Angela! I am always happy to be of service. Speaking of service, would you like to upgrade your television package? AetherNet is running a special right now! Only nineteen thousand credits per month for the first six months!*

I knew better than to interrupt the advertisement. It would just keep playing. ""No, Cosmo. I don't want to upgrade my television package. Thank you, though.""

*No problem, Angela! Enjoy your coffee.*

I couldn't remember the last time I'd asked someone out to coffee. Or even *wanted* to. I sat there, listening to the distant roar of the ocean waves as people passed me by on the boardwalk, contemplating this decision. Why *had* I asked Ozzy to coffee? Was it out of some semblance of gratitude? Something *deeper*, perhaps? Certainly, I was thankful that he'd saved my life that day, and that he had stayed with me in the hospital. He didn't have to do that for a complete *stranger*.

And here I was, a stranger to him, asking him out to coffee. I'd flexed some of my managerial strength and pulled his file, just to make sure he wasn't crazy. I'd found quite the opposite, actually. In seven years, he'd only managed to raise his quota by a paltry *five percent*. Most SanRec Techs would double their quota in two years. Not Ozzy. He'd apparently worked *hard* at keeping his quota as low as possible for *seven years*. Quite the feat. He'd never had any incidents, always coming in right at the time he was supposed to, taking his break and his lunch in silence alone, and leaving right at the time his shift was over.

It was honestly incredible that he'd been able to stay under the radar this whole time.

A deep, sonorous voice sounded at my left side. ""Is this seat taken?""

I jolted out of my reverie, the motion causing a twinge in my right arm. Looking up, I saw the face of my rescuer, bathed in the sunlight. His ear-length brown hair fluttered in the wind, and I was struck for a moment by how incredibly *plain* he looked.

I had an at home exam scheduled this morning and went thru the system test and check in process with no issues. However, when it was my turn in the queue, suddenly I received a message saying ""a proctor has closed your exam window"" and was sent to the survey. When I relaunched onvue it was just a solid gray background.

I went to try and check in again on the website but kept getting the error ""something's wrong please return to the prior step and try again."". It almost seems like my exam was canceled or revoked but whats strange is that a proctor never contacted me via chat or phone. From what I've read on here, it seems the proctor at least tries to reach out and help. The only possible violations I can think of is putting my hand on my face and sipping coffee while waiting in the queue. I didn't think this was a big deal because in my past at home exams the proctor would call and inspect my work area and tell me what I did or didn't need to fix to be compliant.

I have a case open with support and they're saying to wait 3-5 days until I hear something back. The only thing is that I am getting this cert for an employer with a deadline this week and I can't schedule a new exam because I currently have this one open.

1ld27uz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/1ld27uz/new_here_introduction/,"New here, introduction","I'm both happy and sad this place exists; Happy I can talk to a group of people about a problem, sad that so many have the same problem.

I started having panic attacks driving over the last six months. A year ago I had a bad car wreck, both cars were totaled but everyone walked away with just a few bruises. I dealt with insurance and got a new car and was doing great. Since it was such a bad wreck I was shocked I wasn't scared to drive, I was doing fine. One day I was driving to the gym and at a stoplight I felt intensely trapped, wanted to jump out of my car, escape. Heart pounding, fast breathing...the hallmarks of a panic attack.

I have had panic attacks when driving at least once a week ever since. To look at me I probably look fine in the moment, but inside I am having trouble breathing, resisting the urge to escape somehow etc etc. It ALWAYS happens at stoplights or train crossings where I have to wait. I have exactly mapped out my routes and know where every turnout is that I can escape to. I know the traffic pattern timer for the lights near my gym so I know exactly how long until my side of the intersection will get to go. I do feel a bit like a panic attack could come on just by thinking about driving or thinking I need to. I get excited when my husband says he'll drive....and life shouldn't be like that. I am fine driving country roads with fewer cars, stop signs, and 55 mph, it's the city roads with stoplights and train crossings that freak me out.

I am fine with leaving my house, it's ONLY when I am driving.

Things that slightly help: Breathing deeply. Talking out loud while driving. When a panic attack hits I look around and say to myself ""Okay, find three things that are red"" and look around. If I see a train is coming I will drive up and down the street until it passes so I don't have to wait at the tracks. Nothing stops it completely but it helps.

For today, as most days, I need to go to the gym and grocery store. I cut my coffee intake by half today ( I only had one cup). My plan is this; Use my ""look for 3 things that are blue"" distraction, but I was thinking too, what if I think of a stoplight not as a containment of me, but rather ""Okay, the universe wants me to stop and I get to take a break"". I don't know if that thinking will work but anything is worth a try.

I googled my problems this week and thus ran across this group and Agoraphobia, and everything I am dealing with lines up with it. I do have good health insurance but my doc is booked solid and way overworked, so getting an appointment will take a few months.

I have all the usual places that freak me out; Left hand turns, traffic lights, heavy traffic, train crossings.

I was having such a great life of FINALLY having a car and freedom, I am angry and feel cheated that my excitement has turned to dread. I do think it will end someday with hard work, but for now I'm tired of worry and feeling this way. I am glad you all are here sharing your stories, but I'm sorry you all have so many troubles. Compare to many of you I am having it easy, so I am so very sorry for your pain but proud of all of you for reaching out.

Thanks for listening. I'm open to suggestions!

What should I do?,"**Background:** my friend (early 30s/F) and I have been best friends for well over 10+ years. She and her husband have been together for 8 years (married for 1yr) are a great couple and have always had a really healthy & happy relationship. In previous (unhappy/unsatisfactory) relationships, she's been unfaithful at least once and never came clean about it to the guy she cheated on. She's a natural flirt and a charmer. I've always really believed in her & her husband's relationship and and never would've guessed she would be having an affair only one year into marriage. 

**The affair:** my friend told me about a coworker a few months ago, said he was her new ""work crush"". I didn't think much about it. She continued to mention him, about how they started working together more & more... they'd message/DM outside of work, have lunch together most days, leave each other hidden sticky notes around the office, getting along really well, etc. He is probably 10ish years older than her, married with (4) young kids. He's in a position of power at work but not her direct boss/supervisor - just someone of a higher position than her. It reached a point where he asked her to hangout outside of the office and she called me to tell me this. She acknowledged that this was crossing-the-line and I agreed and said she should dial it back. She did exactly that and he caught on, suddenly acting very insecure, and she said ""she got the ick"". We both agreed that it's GREAT that she got the ick so she can move forward. A few days later she gave me another update and let me know that he & her ended up meeting up to ""talk things out"". They ended up basically confessing the love they have for each other just to get it out in the open. I was pretty surprised to hear this and was definitely judging her for it all but was just trying to focus on HER feelings and she said she was feeling good and that she felt like they needed to address the elephant in the room and that they'd now be able to ""just be friends"". All the while, she told me she felt like he could be her soulmate and that she was never certain that her husband was hers. But she was confident in that she did not want to leave her husband and kind of said ""what will be, will be"" meaning she's willing to let this go for now but acknowledging that there could be a world where the two of them end up together. This was all really shocking as she's never once shown any dissatisfaction in her relationship/marriage. Of course she said she felt bad for her husband and hiding this all from him so I didn't want to make her feel worse by reprimanding her.

I didn't follow-up with her much on this and anytime I did, she'd say she was doing fine and they were trying to just be friends. So, I let it be. 

Probably a month later, she texted me upset and said she needed to talk. She started off the conversation by saying she was going to tell me ""the things she's been hiding"". So, since the love confession they continued to hangout at work and during a coffee meeting one day, they kissed. Since then, she had been going to work early so they can make-out in the stairwell, sending nudes to one another, talking on the phone constantly and ended up having sex once. He has a job offer in a different state but told her ""he'd stay"" if she left her husband to be with him. He brought this up multiple times, manipulative and pushy. He was always the one to push her to take things to the next step.

Suddenly, the guy got cold feet and kind of ghosted her (hence why she was upset) when they had plans to spend some intimate time together. She told me that she realized how much of a narcissist he is and how she got played and that she doesn't even know him at all, etc. I told her I agreed with her and now is the time to really walk away, he's shown her his true colors, he's not a good guy, etc. I also raised the point that a lot of this could've been a power play with him being a superior in the workplace and making her feel special by giving her all of this attention. Again, she told me that the affair doesn't change her feelings for her husband and that he's her forever guy. -\_- I really encouraged her to stop talking to this person, which is a piece of advice she's ingnored. 

Since then, she explained to him how upset he made her that one day and they've talked here & there but it does seem like her romantic feelings for him have dissipated and I don't think they've spent any physical time together since. He's moving in a few days (to be with his family in the state w/ his new job) and so the physical affair will definitely come to an end, but I wouldn't be surprised if they continued to stay in touch, which I would strongly advise her against just for her husband's sake... 

Through all of this, I've been the only person she's told. As much as I obviously don't support her actions, I've tried to put that aside just to be there for her as a friend. As self-inflicted as this is, she is experiencing a lot of intense emotions and it's a lot to process by yourself. Any advice I've given her has gone ignored. I've continued to push for her to see a therapist since day 1 and she says she will but hasn't yet. I really want to have some sort of a debrief conversation with her just to unpack everything that has happened and what that means moving forward for her & her marriage, which would be a great opportunity for me to be a little more transparent about my disapprovals.. but I worry that if I was honest with her and push her to acknowledge how shitty she's being / how unfair it is to her husband, that she'd close herself off from me and be alone to deal with it all, which as a friend, I don't want for her.

Casino Dealers: 10 or 5% of winning, which ever is higher or exists, is what I vaguely remember being told

Waiters: I've heard per meal(5-10), by end(20-40) and not at all or depends on if it is speciality dining. Do they also work in pairs? I swear they do, but again....

Music tastes varies a lot. It’s a lot of j-rock or j-pop, metal, edm, sometimes classical or jazz. Or video game soundtracks!

An ideal friend outing for me is like going to get coffee or like gushing about OCs that we make or the latest shows we’ve been watching. Talk about movies and stuff. Drawing and showing off each others art.

1ld1xf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1ld1xf5/dealing_with_a_hostile_work_environment_on/,Dealing with a hostile work environment on weekends and should I escalate now?,"I’ve been working at this new fast food place near my house for about a month and two weeks. I’m still the new hire, but they’ve already trained me on drinks and the cashier role. The past couple of weeks—especially on weekends when it’s the busiest—I’ve started to notice some hostility and shade being thrown my way. At least, that’s how it feels. Sorry if this post is long, but I need advice. It’s starting to mess with my head and affect my mental health at work. I’ve been applying to other jobs, but nothing’s come through yet. I’m stuck with this one for now because I need the money. The one good thing is I’m close with the manager. She gets me, and she’s been supportive since day one.



Friday morning around 5 a.m., I changed the creamer in the machine. I was the only one available at the time—everyone else was busy with other tasks. A few drops ended up on the floor, so I grabbed some paper towels and cleaned it up. As I was doing that, this Asian guy walked by, shook his head, and said, “Well, well,” like he was judging me.

Later that day, about an hour before my shift ended, an older guy ordered a sandwich and a drink. He kept scanning his card to pay, but nothing was going through. I told him it looked like the gift card on his phone was being scanned, and then he stopped. The next customer came up, hovering her card over the machine, ready to pay. I was about to select the debit/credit option, but the machine processed the payment by itself. I told her the system was glitching. I’m pretty sure it charged the old guy’s gift card, so I called him back.

I escalated it to Supervisor B, who refunded it and told me to write my name on the receipt. She looked annoyed, but honestly, I had no control over when the POS decided to mess up.



Last Saturday was insanely busy. I got blamed for a mess that wasn’t even mine. The day before, Supervisor A—who was covering from another store—pulled the coffee grinds too fast, and it caused water and grinds to spill all over the counter and floor. But somehow, I got the blame for it.

Supervisor A is tight with the older lady who’s been working there for five years, so of course she got brought into it too. He asked me how I brewed the coffee. I told him I did it the usual way, same as everyone else—nothing different. But he kept pressing, trying to make a scene, and this was while a line of customers was already forming.

I was on cashier and drinks, handling it solo. I thought Supervisor A came over to help by running coffee, but instead, he just stood there watching me and questioning everything I did. Luckily, my manager came in, cleaned it up, and told everyone to stop pointing fingers.

That same day, the line was long, and I was trying to keep up with drink orders. I was the runner at the time. The same old lady I mentioned earlier kept loudly complaining in an irritated tone that the latte machine was dirty. Thing is, I clean it every time I use it.

Then Supervisor B came over and told me that only the old lady and I had been using the machine, and reminded me to keep it clean. I told her I don’t leave it dirty. She didn’t really believe me, but I just said thanks for the reminder and left it at that.



I also remember Supervisor B telling me to wait for the slushie machine’s green light to turn off before checking if it was blended right. But when others do the same thing, it gets ignored. The whole store—and probably the customers—could hear it too.



This Saturday morning, my anxiety was already high for some reason. I still did my job at the cashier, but this Asian guy was watching my every move like a hawk. Then he stopped me and told me to do it his way instead of how I was doing it. He showed me how to put the hash brown inside the sandwich so the people in the back could make it that way.

I was confused because I was doing the exact same thing — I even chose the hash brown inside the sandwich option from the menu. I never picked the hash brown outside. But he looked at me like I was an idiot.



This Asian guy messed up a drinks order and asked what the drink was on the screen. Did he scold himself? No. He just left and asked the customer. But if it were me, he’d look at me like I was the biggest idiot, shake his head, sound disappointed, and treat me like I’m slow or useless.



That same day, there was a long order. The customer wanted his bagels plain, just toasted with butter on the side. I put “on the side” for all three bagels in the system. The sandwich makers were chatting happily while working. When the order was handed to the customer, Supervisor B said it was wrong.

Supervisor C then told me to do the coffees with an annoyed, done-looking expression. The Asian guy took over the cashier. I overheard Supervisors B and C in the back talking like I was a trainee making mistakes again.

While I was doing a coffee run, I heard the old lady and another guy joking about me, switching pronouns and laughing about how I might mess up again. Another guy made a passing comment to Supervisor C about needing the money, switched to another language, and laughed.



Another time, there was a pizza order. Supervisor C asked me if I knew who placed it. I thought they had left, but when I saw the customer, I called him back. The guy at the sandwich station spoke in their language and said they had left, which I had just said a moment before. He and Supervisor C laughed about it.

Everyone looked happy to leave since their shift ended at 2:30 p.m. Then Supervisor B pulled me aside and asked if I could stay an extra hour. I had already worked nine hours.

Supervisor B told me that one guy at work—the one who laughed with the old lady during the coffee run—hurt his shoulder and went home. Another girl was supposed to come that day but called in sick, and Supervisor B was about to leave too.

Supervisor B said I should take my second break because when I got back, she would be gone. There were only four of us in the store: me, another new girl, a girl who could do sandwiches, cashier, and coffee runs, and a baker in the back. No supervisors on the floor. We had to juggle everything ourselves.

Supervisor B said someone else would come at 5, but 10 minutes past 5, no one showed up. One of the girls told me to go home since there were no customers and thanked me for staying.



The next day, I showed up to work. That Asian guy was watching my every move like a hawk, scrutinizing everything I did. I left some sugar piled up on the counter, then cleaned it up.

I took a break around 8:30, came back 15 minutes later, and then manned the cashier. I hadn’t done any coffee runs yet.

He came over to do coffee runs with me and accused me of leaving sugar piled up in front of the sugar machine. I told him I’d just gotten back, but he insisted it was me. It felt forced. I thought to myself, this isn’t normal anymore.



That Asian guy was on my case all day, making me feel small. When a transaction declined while I was doing an order, I grabbed some pastries and came back to ask him what happened. He got right in my face and said, “That’s why.”

I saw the screen said declined. I was stunned but didn’t want to make a scene. I knew no one working that day would back me up.

This was straight-up bullying and abuse. I just worked through it and didn’t say a word. My confidence took a huge hit. I smiled at customers, but inside, it was killing me.



I’ve been working here for one month and two weeks, and this is only my second weekend shift. I don’t want to work weekends anymore. There’s been a lot of chaos, and I keep getting blamed for things I didn’t do.

I want to quit, but I haven’t found another job yet. My mom’s been upset with me for being unemployed for months and says hurtful things, calling me useless and picky. If I were picky, would I still be stuck here?

I’ve been sending out resumes for months, but places either ghost me or don’t call back. I’m holding on to this job even though I hate it.

I can’t talk to my family or anyone else about this. Some coworkers are hostile and passive-aggressive. I’m sure they talk behind my back. My anxiety spikes every time I come in because I feel unwelcome.

But I feel singled out on Saturdays and Sundays because the coworkers I work with during the week aren’t there.

| (23 F) was with my ex (27/28M) for about a year. I really thought we had a meaningful connection. We broke up a while ago, but occasionally exchanged messages and hooked up a few times, mostly respectful, though distant.
Recently, i posted to my stories that i have the chance to go to Palestine to document the tragic events and tell the stories of the people that was robbed of their voices. He immediately swiped up and said ""wow, huge respect for you to do this
2"" I answered something like ""thanks,
we're waiting for a safer way to enter because of the latest updates, would be nice to meet for a coffee to say goodbye before I leave"" he said he had to think about it, me being done with him (he was really distant, didn't take me to see where he lived the whole time we were together and said I played his conscience when I was drugged by a man at a bar, + more of course but I wanted you guys to get a little backstory, just ask me if there's something you're wondering btw, so let's focus on this situation now
m) I said that if he has to think about saying goodbye it's the same for me if we meet, and wished him well, he turned 180 and said ""you're doing this because you want me back, this whole setup is to get me back, and if you're actually going to Palestine you can ignore all this, but still, if you're going you're an fucking idiot, you're GOING to die, and I don't care, you are crazy manipulative"" so I sent him a voice message explaining that this is somethin doing for the Palestinian people, for peace and human rights - it has nothing to do with him. I said I was going to volunteer in Palestine, something deeply important to me.
He told me l guilt tripped him into getting back with me...
He told me I was playing an Oscar-worthy manipulation role, that I had been ""scheming for months"" to somehow lure him back emotionally, and that I'm unstable, desperate, and using this story as a tool to get his attention.. Then he deleted all his own replies, leaving only my voice notes in the chat, making it seem like I was just ranting into silence. I felt sick when I saw it. It felt like a trap and I literally want to scream at this situation, how can someone I saw a future with treat me and minimise my actions from me talking about genoKide and turn it into something thats about HIM???? He talked about me like a version of me was being staged that isn't even remotely real. He really don't know me if that's what his reality is.
What's tearing me up:
1. I wasn't trying to win him back. I was sharing something that matters to me, from a place of honesty on MY platform. He replied to my story about it. He said that the picture attached to the post I shared about my travels (me with the Palestinian scarf on a pier (which is one of my cities most visited places mind you) was a stab at him because we had a date there over a year ago....?
2. How can someone twist a cause for human rights and vulnerability into manipulation? He once said I played on his guilt when I told him l'd been drugged after we broke up and he was on his way to me during all this, so I told him - because I didn't want to feel unsafe and be alone with knowing when he came. I told him because I was scared and confused, and he was in an uber on his way already.
I'm just reeling. It feels like he wants to believe this twisted version of me, maybe to avoid facing the way he treated me during the relationship and how his mental health is deteriorating, distant, confusing, emotionally absent, and hot/cold in ways that made me question myself constantly and triggered my deeply wounded trauma scars. I've raised myself since I was a little girl. He knows my weak spots, because I trusted him. Bad judgement.
What I really want to know: 1.
Do people really believe
their own false narratives this deeply? Or does he understand that this is made up in his mind? Not that that important, but it breaks my heart that someone I trusted acted like this. He has a high iq. I mistook that for high eq. 2. Will others see through what he's doing and saying, or will they think I'm the manipulative one? 3.
Why would someone I trusted so deeply rewrite the story so drastically? What could possibly be the reason? 4.
Could this come from him still having feelings and not knowing how to handle them? Or is this just a defense mechanism?
I'm heartbroken. Not because i want anything relationship related to do with him (l've stated this multiple times to him as well but he doesn't seem to take in the information) but because the version of me he sees is so far from the truth. All I ever wanted was real connection with him, and any other people I cross paths with. This? This feels like a betrayal of reality itself.
If you've been in a similar situation, how do you anchor yourself to truth when someone you once respected and care for distorts reality this way?
I probably missed a few beats typing all this, so just ask me if there's something that's unclear - rather than making assumptions please
Like I mentioned I raised myself, which means that the people I accept into my inner deepest circles are important to me. As it should be for everyone of course, but it hits a little harder when you don't have a safety net and family to rely on.

1ld1wq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/1ld1wq3/skye_recommendations/,Skye recommendations,"Hi there,
I will be visiting Csotland soon. And I would like some reasonbly priced restiarants there.
Is any of the places mentioned worth it.

The list someone has sent us:

It’s highly recommended, due to the popularity of Skye and the demand for restaurants, that if your planning to eat out that you make a reservation asap.

Some restaurants have limited hours

My experience with the local restaurants is somewhat limited and those on my list are only one time visits.

Tongadale- A local favourite. When you enter it is a pub, but if you go through the pub there is a restaurant in the back. £20 per main. Very good

Cuchillin- No reservations. £35 per person. Excellent

Portree Hotel- £20 per main. Very good

Royal Hotel- A little less expensive, good food but not great. Fantastic view if you get a window table and have daylight.

Cuillin Hills Hotel - I went for lunch. £20 for a meal. Excellent. Fantastic views

Gasta (Portree Candle Centre)- Family friendly, large and open, beautiful views. Pizza was excellent, I did not enjoy the pasta.

Bog Myrtle Skye, located in Struan. Very good for coffee,breakfast or lunch. Beautiful rural location, beautiful views. Very limited hours.

My girlfriend and I went out for a late-night coffee date. We got back to her place around 1 AM. As usual, I walked her to her house. She was standing just inside their gate, facing me. We chatted a bit, and I was waving at her, telling her to go inside and get some rest. She just stood there quietly, looking at me. She didn’t say a word. This lasted for about five minutes, and I remember thinking it was a bit odd, but I assumed she was just tired.

Then I suddenly received a text from her:
""Just finished a quick shower. Gonna sleep now. I’m exhausted.""

I froze. If she had been showering… who was standing at the gate?

Confused and creeped out, I messaged her immediately. She replied saying she had gone straight to the bathroom to take a hot shower as soon as we got home. She didn’t stop at the gate. She didn’t even see me standing outside.

That means I had been staring at someone—something—that only looked like her. It stood there for minutes, silently watching me. We still don’t know what it was. The best explanation we could come up with? Maybe it was a doppelgänger.

To this day, I still get chills when I think about it.",16,1750101366.0,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,6,0.86,False

1ld1w5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ld1w5p/recent_brugada_diagnosis_looking_for_advice/,Recent Brugada diagnosis. Looking for advice,"Hello! I'm 32M and unfortunately I was recently diagnosed with Brugada because an EKG showed the type 1 pattern spontaneously. 

**Holter results:** 

HR average: 67bpm  
Min.: 46bpm

Max: 122bpm (while anxious)

No auricular fibrillation

A few ventricular and supraventricular ectopics that weren't considered important.

No significant pauses

**Stress test:**

Clinically and electrically negative.

No arrythmia.

**Medications:** 

* antihistamines 
* bronchodilator (salbutamol) when my seasonal allergies produce asthma 

No history of fainting and no family history of sudden cardiac arrest. We don't know yet if I'm the first family member that has it. The doctors seem to consider me asymptomatic. I've told them that I sometimes wake up abruptly with a feeling of suffocation that goes away quickly but they think this is probably unrelated and more likely to be sleep apnea.

I have a few questions I was hoping maybe someone could help me with:

1. Is the small risk of an elecrophysiologic study in which they test if it's easy to induce arrythmia through a catheter worth it to assess if I should get an ICD?

2. I've read that some people with Brugada carry a defibrilator with them. Should I get one too?

3. Considering that my risk is low to medium (at least that's the impression I got from the doctors), would getting an ICD anyways be a good idea for the peace of mind or do the risks outweigh the benefit at this moment?

4. Besides avoiding the medications that are on this list [https://www.brugadadrugs.org/](https://www.brugadadrugs.org/) , should I also avoid things like coffee? Cannabis is listed as well but I've only seen reports about THC. Is CBD as dangerous?

1ld1vsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1ld1vsn/fool_me_once_by_harlan_coben_death_is_so_close/,"Fool Me Once by Harlan Coben: Death is so close, always, a breath away, so perhaps it was wise to introduce children to that concept at an early age. Maya filled her head with inanities like this as she watched Joe's casket disappear into the earth. Distract yourself. That was the key. Get.........","**Chapter 1**  
  They buried Joe three days after his murder. Maya wore black, as befitted a grieving widow. The sun pounded down with an unflagging fury that reminded her of her months in the desert. The family pastor spouted the cliches, but Maya wasn't listening. Her eyes drifted to the schoolyard across the street.  Yes, the cemetery overlooked an elementary school.  Maya had driven past here countless times, the graveyard on the left, the elementary school on her right, and yet the strangeness, if not obscenity, of the placement had never really registered with her before. Which came first, she wondered, the schoolyard or the cemetery? Who'd been the one to decide to build a school next to a cemetery--or vice versa? Did it even matter, this life-ending and life-beginning juxtaposition, or was it, in fact, somewhat poignant? Death is so close, always, a breath away, so perhaps it was wise to introduce children to that concept at an early age.  Maya filled her head with inanities like this as she watched Joe's casket disappear into the earth. Distract yourself. That was the key. Get through it.  
  The black dress itched. Over the past decade, Maya had been to a hundred-plus funerals, but this was the first time she'd been obligated to wear black. She hated it.  To her right, Joe's immediate family--his mother, Judith; his brother Neil; his sister, Caroline--wilted from the combination of high temperatures and deep sorrow. To her left, getting antsy and starting to use Maya's arm as a rope swing, was her (and Joe's) two-year-old daughter, Lily. The parenting cliche states that children do not come with instruction manuals. That never seemed more true than today. What, Maya had wondered, was the proper etiquette for a situation like this? Do you leave your two-year-old daughter at home--or do you take her to her father's funeral? That was an issue that they didn't cover on those know-it-all, one-size-fits-all mommy websites. In a fit of pity-anger, Maya had almost posted that question online: ""Hi, Everyone! My husband was recently murdered. Should I bring my two-year-old daughter to the graveyard or leave her home? Oh, and clothing suggestions? Thanks!""  
  There were hundreds of people at the funeral, and in some dimly lit corner of her brain, she realized that this would have pleased Joe. Joe liked people. People liked Joe. But of course, popularity alone wouldn't explain the crowd. Mourners had been drawn in by the horrible lure of being near the tragic: a young man gunned down in cold blood, the charming scion of the wealthy Burkett family--and the husband of a woman mired in an international scandal.  
  Lily wrapped both arms around her mother's leg. Maya bent down and whispered, ""Not much longer, sweetheart, okay?""  
  Lily nodded but held on even tighter.  
 Maya stood back at attention, smoothing the itchy black dress she'd borrowed from Eileen with both hands. Joe would not have wanted her in black. He'd always preferred her in the military formals she'd worn back in the days when she'd been Army Captain Maya Stern. When they'd first met at a Burkett family charity gala, Joe had walked straight up to her in his tails, given her the rakish smile (Maya hadn't understood the term ""rakish"" until she saw that smile), and said, ""Wow, I thought the turn-on was supposed to be men in uniform.""  
  
  It was a lame pickup line, just lame enough to make her laugh, which was all the opening a guy like Joe needed. Man, he was so damn handsome. The memory, even now, even standing in this stifling humidity with his dead body feet away, made her smile. A year later, Maya and Joe were married. Lily came not long after that. And now, as though someone had fast-forwarded a life-together tape, here she was, burying her husband and the father of her only child.  
  
  ""All love stories,"" Maya's father had told her many years ago, ""end in tragedy.""  
  
  Maya had shaken her head and said, ""God, Dad, that's grim.""  
  
  ""Yes, but think about it: You either fall out of love, or, if you're really one of the lucky ones, you live long enough to watch your soul mate die.""  
  
  Maya could still see her father sitting across from her at the kitchen table of yellowing Formica laminate in their Brooklyn town house. Dad wore his customary cardigan sweater (all professions, not just those in the military, wear uniforms of some kind or another), surrounded by the college essays he'd have to grade. He and Mom had died years ago, within months of each other, but in truth, it was still hard for Maya to know which category of tragedy their love story fell into.  
  
  As the pastor prattled on, Judith Burkett, Joe's mother, took hold of Maya's hand in the death grip of the grieving.  
  
  ""This,"" the old woman mumbled, ""is even worse.""  
  
  Maya didn't ask for clarification. She didn't have to. This was the second time Judith Burkett had been forced to bury a child, two of her three sons now gone, one supposedly by tragic accident, one b  
y murder. Maya glanced down at her own child, at the top of Lily's head, and wondered how a mother could live with such pain.  
  
  As if she knew what Maya was thinking, the old woman whispered, ""It'll never be okay,"" her simple words cutting through the air like a reaper's scythe. ""Never.""  
  
  ""It's my fault,"" Maya said.  
  
  She hadn't meant to say it. Judith looked up at her.  
  
  ""I should have . . .""  
  
  ""There was nothing you could have done,"" Judith said. But there was still something off in the tone. Maya understood, because others were probably thinking the same thing. Maya Stern had saved so many in the past. Why couldn't she have saved her own husband?  
  
  ""Ashes to ashes . . .""  
  
  Wow, did the pastor really trot out that hackneyed chestnut or had Maya imagined it? She hadn't been paying attention. She never did at funerals. She had been around death too many times not to understand the secret to getting through them: Go numb. Don't focus on anything. Let all sounds and sights blur to the point of being unrecognizable.  
  
  Joe's casket reached bottom with a thud that echoed too long in the still air. Judith swayed against Maya and let out a low groan. Maya maintained her military bearing--head high, spine straight, shoulders back. She recently had read one of those self-help articles people always emailed around about ""power poses"" and how they were supposed to improve performance. The military understood that tidbit of pop psychology way before its time. As a soldier, you don't stand at attention because it looks nice. You stand at attention because, on some level, it either gives you strength or, just as important, makes you appear stronger to both your comrades and enemies.  
  
  For a moment, Maya flashed back to the park--the glint of metal, the sound of gunshots, Joe falling, Maya's shirt covered in blood, stumbling through the dark, distant streetlights giving off hazy halos of illumination . . .  
  
  ""Help . . . please . . . someone . . . my husband's . . .""  
  
  She closed her eyes and pushed it away.  
  
  Hang on, she told herself now. Just get through it.  
  
  And she did.  
  
  Then there was the receiving line.  
  
  The only two places you stand on receiving lines are funerals and weddings. There was probably something poignant in that fact, but Maya couldn't imagine what it could be.  
  
  She had no idea how many people walked past her, but it took hours. Mourners shuffled forward like a scene in some zombie movie where you slay one but more just keep coming at you.  
  
  Just keep it moving.  
  
  Most offered a low ""Sorry for your loss,"" which was pretty much the perfect thing to say. Others talked too much. They started in about how tragic it all was, what a waste, how the city was going to hell, how they were almost robbed at gunpoint once (rule one: never make it about yourself on a receiving line), how they hoped the police fried the animals who did it, how fortunate Maya was, how God must have been looking out for her (the implication being, she guessed, that God hadn't cared as much about Joe), how there is always a plan, how there is a reason for everything (a wonder she didn't punch those people straight in the face).  
  
  Joe's family grew exhausted and had to sit midway through. Not Maya. She stood throughout, maintained direct eye contact, and greeted each mourner with a firm handshake. She used subtle and not-so-subtle body language to rebuff those who wanted to be more expressive in their grief via hugs or kisses. Inane as their words might have been, Maya listened attentively, nodded, said, ""Thank you for coming"" in the same sincere-ish tone, and then greeted the next person in line.  
  
  Other hard-and-fast rules of the receiving line at a funeral: Don't talk too much. Short platitudes work well because innocuous is far better than offensive. If you feel the need to say more, make it a nice, quick memory of the dead. Never do, for example, what Joe's aunt Edith did. Never cry hysterically and become the most theatrical ""look at me, I'm suffering"" of mourners--and never say something chillingly stupid to the grieving widow like: ""You poor girl, first your sister, now your husband.""  
  
  The world stopped for a moment when Aunt Edith voiced what so many others were thinking, especially when Maya's young nephew, Daniel, and younger niece, Alexa, were within earshot. The blood in Maya's veins thrummed, and it took everything she had not to reach out, grab Aunt Edith's throat, and rip her vocal cords out.  
  
  Instead, Maya said in a sincere-ish tone: ""Thank you for coming.""  
  
  Six of Maya's former platoon mates, including Shane, hung back, keeping a watchful eye on her. That was what they did, like it or not. Guard duty seemed to never end when they were together. They didn't get in line. They knew better. They were her silent sentinels, always, their presence offering the only true comfort on this horrible day.  
  
  Every once in a while, Maya thought that she could hear her daughter's distant giggle--her oldest friend, Eileen Finn, had taken Lily to the playground at the elementary school across the street--but maybe that was just her imagination. The sound of laughing children felt both obscene and life affirming in such a setting: She longed for it and couldn't bear it.  
  
  Daniel and Alexa, Claire's kids, were the last two in line. Maya swept them into her arms, wanting, as always, to protect them from anything else bad happening to them. Eddie, her brother-in-law . . . Is that what he was? What do you call the man who was married to your sister before she was murdered? ""Ex-brother-in-law"" seemed like something more for a divorce. Do you say ""former brother-in-law""? Do you just stick with ""brother-in-law""?  
  
  More inanity designed to distract.  
  
  Eddie approached more tentatively. There were tufts of hair on his face where he'd missed with the razor. Eddie kissed Maya's cheek. The smell of mouthwash and mints was strong enough to drown out whatever else might be there, but then again, wasn't that the point?  
  
  ""I'm going to miss Joe,"" Eddie mumbled.  
  
  ""I know you will. He liked you a lot, Eddie.""  
  
  ""If there's anything we can do . . .""  
  
  You can take better care of your kids, Maya thought, but her normal anger with him was gone now, leaked away like a raft with a pinhole.  
  
  ""We're fine, thanks.""  
  
  Eddie went silent, as if he too could read her mind, which in this case he probably could.  
  
  ""Sorry I missed your last game,"" Maya said to Alexa, ""but I'll be there tomorrow.""  
  
  All three of them suddenly looked uneasy.  
  
  ""Oh, you don't have to do that,"" Eddie said.  
  
  ""It's okay. It'll be a nice distraction.""  
  
  Eddie nodded, gathered up Daniel and Alexa, and headed to the car. Alexa looked back at her as she walked away. Maya gave her the reassuring smile. Nothing has changed, the smile said. I will still always be there for you, just as I promised your mother.  
  
  Maya watched Claire's family get into the car. Daniel, the outgoing fourteen-year-old, took the front seat. Alexa, who was only twelve, sat alone in the back. Since her mother's death, she seemed to always be wincing as though preparing for the next blow. Eddie waved, gave Maya a tired smile, and slipped into the driver's seat.  
  
  Maya waited, watching the car drive slowly away. When it did, she noticed NYPD homicide detective Roger Kierce standing in the distance, leaning against a tree. Even today. Even now. She was tempted to walk over and confront him, demand some answers, but Judith took her hand again.  
  
  ""I'd like you and Lily to come back to Farnwood with us.""  
  
  The Burketts always referred to their house by its name. That probably should have been clue one of what would become of her if she married into such a family.  
  
  ""Thank you,"" Maya said, ""but I think Lily needs to be home.""  
  
  ""She needs to be with family. You both do.""  
  
  ""I appreciate that.""  
  
  ""I mean it. Lily will always be our granddaughter. And you'll always be our daughter.""  
  
  Judith gave her hand an extra squeeze to emphasize the sentiment. It was sweet of Judith to say, like something she was reading off a teleprompter at one of her charity galas, but it was also untrue--at least the part about Maya. No one who married a Burkett was  
anything but a tolerated outsider.  
  
  ""Another time,"" Maya said. ""I'm sure you understand.""  
  
  Judith nodded and gave her a perfunctory hug. So did Joe's brother and sister. She watched their devastated faces as they stumbled toward the stretch limos that would take them to the Burkett estate.  
  
  Her former platoon mates were still there. She met Shane's eyes and gave him a small nod. They got it. They didn't so much ""fall out"" as quietly fade away, being sure not to disturb anything in their wake. Most of them were still enlisted. After what happened near the Syrian-Iraqi border, Maya had been ""encouraged"" to take an honorable discharge. Seeing no other real option, she did. So now, instead of commanding or at least teaching the new recruits, retired Captain Maya Stern, for a short time the face of the new Army, gave flying lessons at Teterboro Airport in northern New Jersey. Some days it was okay. Most days she missed the service more than she'd have ever imagined.  
  
  Maya finally stood alone by the mound of dirt that would soon cover her husband.  
  
  ""Ah, Joe,"" she said out loud.  
  
  She tried to feel a presence. She had tried this before, in countless mourning situations, seeing if she could sense any sort of life force after death, but there was always nothing. Some believed that there had to be at least a small life force--that energy and motion never die completely, that the soul is eternal, that you can't destroy matter permanently, all that. Perhaps that was true, but the more of the dead Maya hung around, the more it felt as though nothing, absolutely nothing, was left behind.  
  
  She stayed by the gravesite until Eileen came back from the playground with Lily.  
  
  ""Ready?"" Eileen asked.  
  
  Maya took another look at the hole in the ground. She wanted to say something profound to Joe, something that might give them both--ugh--closure, but no words came to her.  
  
  Eileen drove them home. Lily fell asleep in a car seat that looked like something designed by NASA. Maya sat in the front passenger seat and stared out the window. When they got to the house--Joe had actually wanted to name it too, but Maya had put her foot down--Maya somehow managed to release the complicated strapping mechanism and eased Lily out of the backseat. She cradled Lily's head so as not to wake her.  
  
  ""Thanks for the ride,"" Maya whispered.  
  
  Eileen turned off the car. ""Do you mind if I come in for a second?""  
  
  ""We'll be fine.""  
  
  ""No doubt."" Eileen unbuckled her seat belt. ""But I've been meaning to give you something. It'll just take two minutes.

  
 Maya held it in her hand. ""A digital picture frame?""  
  
  Eileen was a strawberry blonde with freckles and a wide smile. She had the kind of face that lit up a room when she entered, which made it a great mask for the torment beneath.  
  
  ""No, it's a nanny cam disguised as a digital picture frame.""  
  
  ""Say again?""  
  
  ""Now that you're working full-time, you've got to keep a better eye on things, right?""  
  
  ""I guess so.""  
  
  ""Where does Isabella play with Lily most of the time?""  
  
  Maya gestured to her right. ""In the den.""  
  
  ""Come on, I'll show you.""  
  
  ""Eileen . . .""  
  
  She took the frame from Maya's hand. ""Just follow me.""  
  
  The den was right off the kitchen. It had a cathedral ceiling and plenty of blond wood. A big-screen television hung on the wall. There were two baskets filled to the brim with educational toys for Lily. A Pack 'n Play stood in front of the couch where there used to be a beautiful mahogany coffee table. The coffee table, alas, hadn't been child friendly, so it had to go.  
  
  Eileen moved toward the bookshelf. She found a spot for the frame and plugged the cord into a nearby outlet. ""I already preloaded some pictures of your family. The digital frame will just shuffle through and display them. Do Isabella and Lily normally play by that couch?""  
  
  ""Yes.""  
  
  ""Good."" Eileen shifted the frame in that direction. ""The camera built inside this thing is wide-angle, so you can see the whole room.""  
  
  ""Eileen--""  
  
  ""I saw her at the funeral.""  
  
  ""Who?""  
  
  ""Your nanny.""  
  
  ""Isabella's family goes way back with Joe's. Her mother was Joe's nanny. Her brother is the family gardener.""  
  
  ""For real?""  
  
  Maya shrugged. ""The rich.""  
  
  ""They're different.""  
  
  ""They are.""  
  
  ""So do you trust her?""  
  
  ""Who, Isabella?""  
  
  ""Yes.""  
  
  Maya shrugged. ""You know me.""  
  
  ""I do."" Eileen had originally been Claire's friend--the two had been assigned as freshman roommates at Vassar--but all three women quickly grew close. ""You trust no one, Maya.""  
  
  ""I wouldn't put it that way.""  
  
  ""Fine. When it comes to your child?""  
  
  ""When it comes to my child,"" Maya said, ""yeah, okay, no one.""  
  
  Eileen smiled. ""That's why I'm giving you this. Look, I don't think you'll find anything. Isabella seems great.""  
  
  ""But better safe than sorry?""  
  
  ""Exactly. I can't tell you how much comfort it gave me when I left Kyle and Missy with the nanny.""  
  
  Maya wondered about that--whether Eileen had just used it with the nanny or whether she had built a case against someone else--but she kept the thought to herself for now.  
  
  ""Do you have an SD card port on your computer?"" Eileen asked.  
  
  ""I'm not sure.""  
  
  ""Doesn't matter. I got you an SD reader that connects into any USB port. Just plug it into your laptop or computer. Really, it doesn't get easier than this. You take the SD card out of the frame at the end of the day--it's back here, see?""  
  
  Maya nodded.  
  
  ""Then you stick the card into the reader. The video pops up on your screen. The SD is thirty-two gigs, so it should last days easily. There's also a motion detector, so it's not recording when the room is empty or anything like that.""  
  
  Maya couldn't help but smile. ""Look at you.""  
  
  ""What? The role reversal bothering you?""  
  
  ""A little. I should have thought of doing this myself.""  
  
  ""I'm surprised you didn't.""  
  
  Maya looked down and met her friend's eye. Eileen was maybe five two, Maya nearly six feet tall, but with the ramrod posture, she looked even taller. ""Did you ever see anything on your nanny cam?""  
  
  ""You mean, something I shouldn't have?"" Yeah. No,"" Eileen said. ""And I know what you're thinking. He hasn't been back. And I haven't seen him.""

Every time i go shopping in person or even stop for a cup of coffee, they ask if I’m a “member” or if id like to register for something. Often, when i say “no”, the cashier tries to convince me to sign up. I don’t know why i need to use a mobile app for a McDonalds burger, become a member for a cup of coffee, or register my number to buy a book at barnes and noble. Every business has their own app and memberships. 

Yesterday, i tried to sign up for a website to receive custom shampoo and hair products. 10 minutes in, they are asking me about  stressful events in my life, diet, medications, exercise routine, and other incredibly personal things. The questions were never ending and the longer i went on, the less it had to do with hair. I eventually gave up… does anyone else feel bombarded by this or am i just weird?

Ruan Sixian [played by Liu Xiening] was originally a flight attendant who dreamed of becoming a pilot, but was frustrated when Hengshi Airlines cancelled its pilot training program. She also resigned due to a misunderstanding with Hengshi Airlines Vice President Fu Mingyu [played by Miles Wei] and switched to flight training. Three years later, Ruan Sixian graduated from the flight academy at the top of her class and became a highly sought-after candidate among major airlines. 

To introduce a new fleet of aircraft, Fu Mingyu personally visited the flight academy for recruitment. Confronting their past misunderstanding and stiff competition from other companies, he set aside his pride and offered Ruan Sixian generous terms to bring her on board. Her dazzling return impressed many, but also reignited old rumors.

Ruan Sixian faced strict evaluations, unexpected emergencies, and even a grounding. Meanwhile, Fu Mingyu encountered numerous obstacles during the company's reform efforts. >!Yet through mutual support and understanding, their relationship gradually deepened, opening a new chapter in their lives as they each achieved their career goals.!<

***

[Synopsis from MDL](https://mydramalist.com/760547-jiang-luo-wo-xin-shang):

Fu Ming Yu, the president of Hengshi Airlines, took a first-class flight in his own plane. A flight attendant arbitrarily offered him coffee three times.

Fu Ming Yu raised his eyes and looked at the flight attendant with a slender waist, long legs and silky eyes. He said, “This job, do you not want it anymore?”
The flight attendant said with a smile, “Yes, I don’t want to be a flight attendant at Hengshi Airlines. I want to be…”
“The wife of the boss?” Fu Ming Yu interrupts her coldly.
The flight attendant was stunned.
Fu Ming Yu: “You might as well just dream.”

Three years later, Fu Ming Yu boarded the same flight again. He saw the woman standing in the middle of the crew at a glance, still the familiar and charming face. She was still smiling, but the epaulettes on her clothes were particularly conspicuous.
“President Fu, Ruan Si Xian, the co-pilot of this flight, will serve you wholeheartedly.”
Fu Ming Yu: “…”

The female pilot who can go to the sky at any time vs. don’t ask, if you ask, the domineering president will buy you an airplane every minute.

Start your digital day with the calm and charm of the blocky world in this [Minecraft – Peaceful Sunrise by the Pond live wallpaper](https://wallsflow.com/506-minecraft-tranquil-morning-pond-live-wallpaper.html). As the first rays of sunlight gently break through a layer of mist, they cast golden reflections on a serene pond surrounded by wildflowers, pixelated reeds, and tall, majestic trees. The world awakens slowly here—quiet, untouched, and beautiful in its simplicity.

This [live wallpaper](https://wallsflow.com/live-wallpapers/) captures the very essence of what Minecraft does best: transforming simple pixels into immersive experiences. A wooden house with flower-filled balconies sits peacefully on the edge of the pond, its rustic beams and cobblestone textures glowing softly in the morning light. Floating lily pads with softly glowing flowers drift lazily across the water’s surface, while distant wheat fields shimmer like gold under the rising sun.

On the porch of the house, a Minecraft character enjoys the tranquility—perhaps sipping an imaginary cup of pixel coffee—adding a sense of life and warmth to the scene. The peaceful ambiance is almost tangible: the quiet rustle of leaves, the glimmer of morning dew, the subtle movement of water. This is not just a background—it’s a digital escape to a slower, more peaceful world.

Whether you're a longtime Minecraft enthusiast or simply someone who appreciates tranquil, nature-inspired visuals, this [*minecraft-live-wallpaper*](https://wallsflow.com/tags/minecraft/) offers the perfect blend of animation, emotion, and nostalgia. Ideal for desktops or mobile devices, it brings the soul of Minecraft’s serene countryside to your screen with immersive HD quality and fluid animation.

Set it as your background and let yourself drift into this peaceful *minecraft-sunrise-scene*, where time seems to stand still. The combination of pixel-art beauty and natural harmony makes this wallpaper an excellent choice for those seeking calm, clarity, and a touch of [Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft) magic in their daily routine.

1ld1jgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ld1jgr/why_are_my_pulls_insanely_messy_casabrew_cm5814/,Why are my pulls insanely messy?! [Casabrew CM5814],"I got this machine brand new, used it for the first time expecting to run into problems given my experience as a short lived barista (coffee shop closed cuz the owner sucked lol, rip) but I have a pretty decent understanding as to what good espresso is supposed to the taste and look like. However, I haven’t used a home machine before. I spent all morning pulling shots (a total of 9 pulls, no my machine didnt over heat- I took my time with it for that reason) and about half of them tasted great, some with crème. And the other half was sour without any crème. Each pull did spray however, only a few sprayed a little bit the rest made a huge mess lol. In between each shot I ran and empty pull to clean out the machine like the instructions suggested and I noticed that even the empty pulls weren’t creating a single stream, there were bubbles and it almost looked like the three streams were dancing with each other. That led me to believe something is wrong with the shower screen due to the uneven flow paths.



Here’s the equipment I’m using..



• ⁠casabrew cm5418

• ⁠k6 straight handle KINGrinder

• ⁠fogkay 51mm bottomless portafilter with its stock basket

• ⁠a 30lb tamping kit with a WDT tool with thin wires and a funnel



Here’s my each of my shot descriptions using a medium dark roast espresso from a local roasting plant.



1. ⁠16.5g of beans, ground at 23 clicks and pulled for 28 seconds \~ made a huge mess, tasted a little sour, no crème

2. ⁠15.5g of beans, ground at 24 clicks and pulled for 21-24 seconds (forgot timer and counted in my head lol) \~ light spraying, tasted decent but not to its full potential, little creme

3. ⁠15.5g of beans, ground at 25 clicks (getter coarser to create less pressure) and pulled for about 29 seconds \~ sprayed more than previous shot but not near as much as the first pull, no creme

4. ⁠16g of beans, ground at 23 clicks and pulled for 26-27 seconds \~ no spray but 3 separate streams then espresso began to trail off the portafilter handle?! Super weird, never experienced that before. Ironically this was the best tasting shot, not perfect but pretty good.

5. ⁠16g of beans, ground at 24 clicks and pulled for 30 seconds \~ sprayed a medium amount but at the end of the pull the crème began to bubble from the portafilter leading me to believe the shot was over pulled. Forgot to write down tasting notes, oopsie

6. ⁠15.7g of beans, ground at 25 clicks and pulled for 30 seconds again \~ immense spraying and creme bubbles at the end confirming 30 seconds is way too long. Sour as shit lol

7. ⁠14.5g of beans, ground at 25 clicks, pulled for 28 seconds \~ sprayed a pretty decent amount, got so sad I forgot to write notes 🤣

8. ⁠13.5g of beans, ground at 26 clicks, pulled for 29 seconds \~ this pull was trying to create less pressure with coarser and less grounds. It started pulling fair in 3 streams but at 10 seconds it started spraying. I feel like the puck keeps collapsing mid pull due to uneven water distribution. I was so careful with my tamping, inspecting each tamp assuring its level and even. Sour taste

9. ⁠15.5g of beans, ground at 25 clicks, pulled for 27 seconds \~ began spraying at 8 seconds, mild sourness but sour nonetheless. Upon defeat, I used my sad espresso to make an americano.



If you’ve read this far you are a LEGEND, thank you!!! Comment your thoughts! I wasn’t using a screen this entire time (didn’t have any cuz Reddit said they’re useless) and my tamping ritual was consistent all the way through, I really think there is something going on with the shower screen or something",1,1750100538.0,espresso,7,1.0,False

And I actually never thought about it before. I have this cute colleague. We haven’t been that close but we had some chats and they were fun. She sometimes made some statements that she thinks I’m funny, but nothing special yet. I never flirted or tried to do anything at my job. Honestly haven’t even thought about her more than a colleague. Then we had a company trip. Lots of alcohol. And we spent a lot of time together. One time I complained about my hotel room (we all had different quality levels randomly selected) and she proposed we could share her room and said it with a wink. Probably more as a joke but it still had a vibe. Until the end we’ve been in company of each other. It felt really good spending time with her. And it felt mutual. She always cheered when we’ve been selected to do anything together. When the first regular office day after that trip came, she sat next to me (never happened before) and she asked during the day if we want to drink a coffee together. We did. But that was the last time she made any move in my direction. The next day I asked for coffee. Then again on the next day. Even asked if we wanna go for a walk. She agrees. But I feel needy.  A few days have passed, and we only communicate when I initiate it. She feels cold in my direction.

They said they wanted something stable like a friend who could just come over to hang out not a ONS (they tried it before and now they wanted a real connection). It sounded nice so we started talking.
When we planned to meet the guy (32m) suggested we get coffee just the two of us because his gf (28f) had a weird work schedule and was tired. We met at a diner had a good chat then went to his place. She was there but sleeping. We kept things quiet and there was some touching but then he said she wanted to give us “permission” before we kissed which made sense since we hadn’t met yet. But a couple minutes later he tried to kiss me anyway which was confusing.
Later that night we hung out again (she wasn’t home) and he was more touchy but still respectful. When she got home she was exhausted but tried to talk to me a bit before going to bed. I left soon after.
The next day I was nearby and asked if I could stop by to charge my phone. He said yes but once I got there he told me she wasn’t feeling great and needed silence (she wasn’t home yet but would be soon). I left after 15 minutes and it just felt weird. He was still super nice and said I could come by anytime if I was in the area.
The next day she texted me saying they wanted to go out and asked if I had plans. I said I was going clubbing with friends and didn’t invite them. Then she said they’d go to the same club and see me there. I thought it was a little weird but whatever. I talked and danced with them a bit but mostly stayed with my friends.
After the club we got McDonalds and they invited me back to their place to wait for my Uber. He kind of suggested I stay the night but she ignored that. I was drunk and had trouble walking so he helped me while she walked ahead. Once we got there she went upstairs and he and I waited in the lobby.
Then she started texting him saying I was only into him and that I was “his girl” and not her problem. That really hurt. He just said I needed to understand why she felt left out. I said maybe we weren’t a good fit and he didn’t really say anything.
I texted her later apologizing if I gave the wrong impression and for being drunk. She replied the next day saying she was sorry for what she said that things had been off with them already and my arrival kind of made it all spiral. She said it wasn’t the end and that we will see each other again, she just needed some time. I said I understood and wished her the best. I also texted him something short and kind and he just liked the message the next day.
It’s been a weird few days. At first I felt like I messed everything up but now I think they just weren’t actually ready for what they said they wanted. It felt pretty one-sided in the end.
If they reach out again do you think I should give them another chance? Could something like this actually work?

TLDR: Met a couple who said they wanted a stable connection. Ended up feeling like she wasn’t on the same page and I got caught in their tension. Now I’m wondering if I should give them another chance if they reach out again.",4,1750100257.0,polyamory,25,1.0,False

I’m building a unique mobile project and would love advice from anyone with experience in custom builds, overlanding, or international travel.

My Setup:

I’m converting a 20ft x 8ft flatbed truck into a rolling tiny home, wellness studio, and mobile food/coffee business.

The build uses two 8x6 wood sheds (Heartland Alexandria with polycarbonate roofs), one at each end of the flatbed.

Shed 1 will be my living space, kitchen, office, and have a loft bed above.

Shed 2 will be a hot yoga/sauna studio with a wood stove and bench.

The sheds are installed with a 5ft gap between them. When parked, I’ll open both sets of double doors and add a removable, weatherproof roof (supported by 4x4 beams) to create a single, unified indoor-outdoor area that connects both sheds. This central space is for relaxation, stretching, or just hanging out—not for client restrooms or similar use.

While driving, this middle area will store outdoor gear, bikes, and the removable roof panel.

I’m also planning a solar cabinet for power, a dedicated storage and bike rack at the rear, and flexible use of the central space depending on whether I’m parked or moving.

My Plan:

Travel the entire Pan-American Highway (Alaska to Argentina), through 14 countries.

Operate a mobile wellness studio (hot yoga, sauna, cold plunge) and a food/coffee business (I’m a chef/barista—think sandwiches, souvlaki pitas, specialty coffee) wherever I stop.

Use the central space as a weather-protected area that brings the two sheds together when parked.

Questions:

Has anyone built or traveled with a similar “shed on flatbed” or modular tiny home? Any tips for structural integrity, weatherproofing, or maximizing space?

What legal or border crossing challenges should I expect with a custom rig like this? (Registration, insurance, commercial use, vehicle dimensions, etc. across multiple countries)

Any advice for running a mobile business (food/wellness) on the road, especially internationally?

Darién Gap: Best way to ship a tall/wide rig like this between Panama and Colombia?

Any must-know safety, roadworthiness, or practical tips for a build this size?

If anyone has documented a similar build on YouTube or elsewhere, I’d love to check it out—please share links!

I’m excited (and a bit nervous) to bring this vision to life. Any advice, stories, or resources would be hugely appreciated. Thanks in advance!",1,1750099951.0,u_TechnicianGreat595,0,1.0,False

I need honest insight – not pity, not sugarcoating. I just want to understand: how did this happen?

I (23 F) was with my ex (27/28M) for about a year. I really thought we had a meaningful connection. We broke up a while ago, but occasionally exchanged messages and hooked up a few times, mostly respectful, though distant.

Recently, i posted to my stories that i have the chance to go to Palestine to document the tragic events and tell the stories of the people that was robbed of their voices. He immediately swiped up and said “wow, huge respect for you to do this ❤️” I answered something like “thanks, we’re waiting for a safer way to enter because of the latest updates, would be nice to meet for a coffee to say goodbye before I leave” he said he had to think about it, me being done with him (he was really distant, didn’t take me to see where he lived the whole time we were together and said I played his conscience when I was drugged by a man at a bar, + more of course but I wanted you guys to get a little backstory, just ask me if there’s something you’re wondering btw, so let’s focus on this situation now m) I said that if he has to think about saying goodbye it’s the same for me if we meet, and wished him well, he turned 180 and said “you’re doing this because you want me back, this whole setup is to get me back, and if you’re actually going to Palestine you can ignore all this, but still, if you’re going you’re an fucking idiot, you’re GOING to die, and I don’t care, you are crazy manipulative” so I sent him a voice message explaining that this is something I’m doing for the Palestinian people, for peace and human rights - it has nothing to do with him. I said I was going to volunteer in Palestine, something deeply important to me. He told me I guilt tripped him into getting back with me…

He told me I was playing an Oscar-worthy manipulation role, that I had been “scheming for months” to somehow lure him back emotionally, and that I’m unstable, desperate, and using this story as a tool to get his attention.

Then he deleted all his own replies, leaving only my voice notes in the chat, making it seem like I was just ranting into silence. I felt sick when I saw it. It felt like a trap and I literally want to scream at this situation, how can someone I saw a future with treat me and minimise my actions from me talking about genoKide and turn it into something thats about HIM???? He talked about me like a version of me was being staged that isn’t even remotely real. He really don’t know me if that’s what his reality is. 

What’s tearing me up:
1. I wasn’t trying to win him back. I was sharing something that matters to me, from a place of honesty. He replied to my story about it. He said that the picture attached to the post I shared about my travels (me with the Palestinian scarf on a pier (which is one of my cities most visited places mind you) was a stab at him because we had a date there over a year ago….?
2. How can someone twist a cause for human rights and  vulnerability into manipulation?
He once said I played on his guilt when I told him I’d been drugged after we broke up and he was on his way to me during all this, so I told him - because I didn’t want to feel unsafe and be alone with knowing when he came. I told him because I was scared and confused, and he was in an uber on his way already. 

I’m just reeling. It feels like he wants to believe this twisted version of me, maybe to avoid facing the way he treated me during the relationship and how his mental health is deteriorating, distant, confusing, emotionally absent, and hot/cold in ways that made me question myself constantly and triggered my deeply wounded trauma scars. I’ve raised myself since I was a little girl. He knows my weak spots, because I trusted him. Bad judgement. 

What I really want to know:
	1.	Do people really believe their own false narratives this deeply? Or does he understand that this is made up in his mind? Not that it’s that important, but it breaks my heart that someone I trusted acted like this. He has a high iq, I mistook that for high EQ. 
	2.	Will others see through what he’s doing and saying, or will they think I’m the manipulative one?
	3.	Why would someone I trusted so deeply rewrite the story so drastically? What could possibly be the reason? 
	4.	Could this come from him still having feelings and not knowing how to handle them? Or is this just a defense mechanism?

I’m heartbroken. Not because i want anything relationship related to do with him (I’ve stated this multiple times to him as well but he doesn’t seem to take in the information) but because the version of me he sees is so far from the truth. All I ever wanted was real connection with him, and any other people I cross paths with. This? This feels like a betrayal of reality itself.

If you’ve been in a similar situation, how do you anchor yourself to truth when someone you once respected and care for distorts reality this way?

I probably missed a few beats typing all this, so just ask me if there’s something that’s unclear - rather than making assumptions please 🫂

Like I mentioned I raised myself, which means that the people I accept into my inner deepest circles are important to me. As it should be for everyone of course, but it hits a little harder when you don’t have a safety net and family to rely on. 

Thanks for reading. Free Palestine. ❤️

we opened this store just two months ago, and i’ve already experienced more stress than i ever have at any of my previous jobs. i’ve never dealt with these kinds of issues from other employers, so this has been really frustrating and confusing.

my manager is ex-military, and he definitely brings that energy into the workplace. he’s a complete control freak—he micromanages everything and acts like we’re running some kind of boot camp. it’s just a coffee shop, and it doesn’t need to be that serious. from day one, he’s constantly criticized me and never given any positive feedback. recently, after i had to call in and adjust my schedule, he suddenly told me he was “taking me off the schedule for now” because of “a lot of other things,” but couldn’t explain what those things were. there were no prior issues, so it really feels like he’s just making something up to justify the decision.

he also plays obvious favorites. one employee he favors was given $200 for “doing a good job,” which felt like a slap in the face to the rest of us who are also working hard and getting no recognition. i’ve also heard rumors that he did similar things at his last store—favoring a female employee and even taking her on a trip after naming her “barista of the year.” even if that’s just a rumor, it adds to how off everything feels.

i’ve stayed because i like the job and my team, but he’s made the environment really toxic and uncomfortable. i’m not sure if i’m overreacting or if there’s something i’m missing, so i’d appreciate any honest feedback.",1,1750099720.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

Hey, fellow time warriors! Ever feel like time is slipping through your fingers like sand? You’re not alone! 🙃 Let’s take a moment and chat about something that could change the game for us all: the **Time Audit Challenge**. 

Here’s the thing— we often think we’re super productive, but what are we really doing with our time? Watching cat videos? Scrolling endlessly through memes? (No shame, I’m guilty too!). The first step in leveling up our focus is to find out exactly where our time goes. 

**So, how does this work? Let me break it down:** 

1. **Grab a Notepad (or your phone, no judgment!)**: For a week, jot down how you spend your time. Yes, even the time you spend debating what to order for lunch. 

2. **Categorize It:** Don’t just write “working” and call it a day. Break it down! 
   - **Work Tasks**: Emails, meetings, projects
   - **Breaks**: Coffee runs, scroll time
   - **Chores**: Grocery shopping, laundry (ugh, why is it never-ending?)
   - **Self-Care**: Exercise, meditation, Netflix binges (what’s your latest obsession?).

3. **At the End of the Week:** Reflect! Look back at your notes and see where you spent the most (and least) time. Any surprises? Are you spending more time on TikTok than working on that side hustle? 😅

4. **Ask Yourself These Questions:**
   - Are there tasks that fill up your day but don’t move you closer to your goals?
   - What can you cut out or delegate? (Seriously, ask a friend for help!)
   - How can you prioritize your time better next week?

Remember, it's all about working smarter, not harder! It’s like the difference between trying to catch the wind with your hands and using a sail. 🌬️

**A little personal story to relate:**  
Last week, I did my own time audit and realized I was spending nearly two hours a day just scrolling. Say what?! 🚀 After tracking my time, I decided to swap one of those scrolling sessions for a quick workout, and let me tell you, I felt way more energized!

I am 5'4, 20 years old and go to the gym whenever I can. I am trying to lose body fat while getting my weight to 120 lbs to 125 lbs. I am currently around 127 lbs. 

I do eat pretty good meals, but I struggle with adding fiber to my diet. Lately, I have been doing chia seed pudding in the morning and more spinach in the evening. My meal throughout the day usually looks like this: 

1. Breakfast: Coffee, chia seed pudding, fruits if I have them, and a scoop of homemade ice cream 

2. Lunch: Remaining pint of homemade ice cream. Usually pineapple ice cream that I made is under 300 calories + watermelon + whatever is available. Usually, the ice cream keeps me full. 

3. Dinner: Chicken, rice, spinach for every day

I have been drinking more water. I also occasionally drink matcha. Usually, I snack on a serving of chips every other day. I find myself volume eating, which keeps me pretty full. I consume quite a bit of Greek yogurt through my chia seed pudding and ice cream as I add it for some creaminess. Every now and then, I eat cup noodles or spicy noodles for lunch. I also drink protein drinks every now and then for lunch.

This may have been obvious to some people, but I just found out how to make cheap coffee taste better!

I was recently gifted whole beans and a grinder for my (thrifted) espresso machine, and it's coming out sour as can be. I tried it with some good beans from a friend and it came out perfect, so I know it's not the machine.

I personally HATE that sour/acidic taste that you get from cheap coffee beans. I'm by no means a snob, but I would rather just not drink it if I don't like it.

But if you add a *tiny* pinch of baking soda, it's perfect! It neutralizes the acid the way it does in homemade cheese sauce, and you're left with a smooth, rich cup.

Homeless man walked in with $1.90 and asked how much a coffee was & I said he would not be able to afford anything, but I offered a hot water cup and an espresso shot, to make him an americano which was $1.75. 

My manager got mad and walked up to me “What am I supposed to do with this?!” I said “It’s an americano.” she proceeded to get more upset and said “Then why didn’t you ring it up as an americano?!” to which I blankly said “Because he couldn’t afford it.” she rolled her eyes and walked away. 

My argument is that he was a paying customer, and it wasn’t that big of a deal, nor did it need a reaction. I was showing compassion for a homeless man who just wanted a fucking cup of coffee. 

He paid, the money is in the till, put the fucking espresso in the hot water cup and hand it off.

I have a few friends there. Not a support system though. I am a single mom to a 3 year old. 

It would be a very big move for me. 

I’ve visited Chicago twice and I do feel a nudge to explore living there more— I feel at home there, but I’m sure that’s a normal tourist feeling. Lol. 

I will be going back twice in July to make sure I’m not considering this big of a move on a whim and looking to gather a lot of information.

I’m from Nashville, TN. Divorced this year, moved back home to have a support system and that actually has not panned out like I thought. 

Which— actually has built confidence in me that I can solo parent anywhere “alone” and make it all work especially with coparenting out of state. I tend to find my “family” outside of bio family.

Biggest questions I need answered are neighborhoods for single families that would be more community driven so I can build a support system there. Affordable ($1600/1900/month). Ideally 2 bed. May consider temporary/furnished housing.

I own a coffee cart in TN and will figure out logistically what that looks like for being operable in Chicago. But off the bat— any rules or things I should be aware of?

Schools/childcare/babysitting— what’s all of this like? She’s three, so starting school is just right on us. 

Should I join any other groups either other subreddits or FB groups? Should I consider move suburbs versus the actual city? 

This would be the biggest city I’ve lived in and excited that my daughter would experience city living. 😊

The director had to be fucking kidding.

Dexter, my co-star, was already  screaming at his agent. I could see why, considering Dexter’s past. 

But he was also *rich*. 

Dex could afford the treatment.

Even if he did still have anger problems. 

Bee, another co-star, thought Freddie was *cute*. 

It was a *creative decision, apparently.* 

This show had thrown me into LA and the bubbling underbelly beneath it. 

Açaí bowls, branded coffee, and cocaine snorted off a stranger. 

But the director had no idea what he was doing when he brought Freddie in. 

“Lydia, do you *want* a Kids Choice Award?” my agent demanded over the phone. 

I met Dexter’s glare across the room.

*”Do not fuck this up for us.”*

We were nominated for best couple. 

“Yes.” 

“Good,” she said. “I know things have felt strange since the pandemic—”

I ended the call when we were summoned to set. 

It was a 1950s-themed living room with bright yellow wallpaper and a worn-out sofa we all had to squeeze onto. 

Freddie was placed beside me. 

Dexter flopped down on my other side, followed by Bee, and finally Zach, who showed up last, fresh from hair and makeup. The look on his face when he spotted Freddie sent a chill trickling down my spine.

Still, he forced a smile, whipped off his shades, and took an uncertain seat with us. “Who's the new guy?” 

On *Action*! I wasn’t expecting Freddie to get so close, his hot breath grazing my neck.

“Hey,” he murmured. “You smell good.”

I tried to inch away, but he followed, a low growl rumbling in his throat. 

I knew what to do and what was going to happen. I dove to my feet just as he exploded into hysterical giggles.

I hit the ground, paralyzed beneath the makeshift coffee table, as Freddie ripped Zach’s head off, leaving behind a skeletal stump. 

Screams erupted around me.

I knelt in a pool of bright, seeping scarlet. My mind spun. 

I watched Freddie feast, gnawing on Bee’s guts, stringy intestines caught between his teeth, until he stopped. 

His half-glazed eyes found mine, jaw locking into place. 

I screamed, scrambling backward, and he dropped to his knees, blood running down his chin, a violent, pulsating red bleeding into his pupils. Dexter was still alive somehow, also on his knees. 

Freddie had left him alone. 

But I could see the way his body was twitching into its old ways. 

Fuck.

I knew he wasn't better. 

Dexter’s head snapped up, an all-too-familiar bloody red clouding his right eye. Freddie lunged, pinning me down, and I felt it his teeth ripping into my arm, clamping down. It was so fast. 

The anger. 

Hysteria I couldn’t control. 

The despair clouding my thoughts, sending my head jerking, my hands forming fists. 

I laughed, spitting blood down my chin.

I'll give you my take and you're gonna have your mind changed in no time, so fast your head will spin, no kizzy

Look, the first reason is kinda a meme but let's be honest. That whole assassination thing was a larp. Oh no I got shot, ""it's gonna take more than that to kill a bull moose"" is a corny ahh thing to say fr. Like bro cut the act, we all know that hurt lmao. Bro really said ""no I swear a bullet in the chest didn't hurt, please believe me.""

But I don't wanna sully this sub with a bunch of low effort shit so imma move to the policies in a sec. Just one thing about coffee, because apparently he drank some coffee and said ""good to the last drop"" which is where we get that saying from. Once again, bro is trying too hard. Nobody says that corny ahh shit after drinking some coffee. I feel like bro spent his whole life trying to be the main character and we all just ran with it. Bro should have been more nonchalant, and less chant, if you feeling me.

But I wanna stick to the policies because this is a serious sub. I'm not sure why some people put that clown Wilson in F tier but put the corn dog Ted in A or S. Like bro, they were basically the same political style. Both were progress guys, both were unvarnished racists. Come on now, how are they all that different? Someone please explain homies.

And maybe you should be angrier at him for stealing that 1912 shit from Taft and handing it over to Frankenstein ahh Woody Willdog. That shit was cringe, and once again, was all because poor Teddy couldn't handle being the main character. HE HAD MAIN CHARACTER SYNDROME.

Our involvement in World War I was a mistake, and the events immediately following that disastrous conflict precipitated the even more horrendous circumstances felt during World War II. We rightly criticize Wilson for entering the war after campaigning on keeping us out, but should we not also criticize Ted Rooster for so vociferously bellowing on about the necessity to commit American boys to that conflict which did not in any way affect us or our homeland?

Bro seemed to always be compensating for something, frfr. Between the main character syndrome and itching for war, I think bro was always trying to convince himself he was a real man. Im not buying it even though everyone else seems to. Sorry Ted.

1ld0ruw,https://i.redd.it/blhy4xr41c7f1.png,I made a mocktail iced tea by following a recipe.,"Third time I made the same mocktail, never made a proper cocktail though. I followed Dan Fellows' mocktail iced tea recipe. Well, the base. I swapped the syrup out for honey though because I have no syrup.

Tea of choice 3 grams (or tea bags, use good quality tea)

100 ml water 

25 ml syrup (swapped out for honey this time and I only used ten grams of it to experiment)

Okay, I didn't add enough honey. Trial and error and I will get it right at some point.

I have no proper bartender equipment, so I used a 2 liter jar, my coffee scales and the honey.

This one is shaken.

Also, I have no idea how to make garnish

  
I am not an expert, it's my first time getting into mocktails and cocktails, I am curious though.

1ld0rdx,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersGroup/comments/1ld0rdx/im_seventeen_and_this_is_my_first_real_short/,I’m seventeen and this is my first “real” short story that I don’t find repulsively bad. Maybe one wanna give it a read,"As the title says. I'd love to hear some constructive feedback. But I also like praise, so go all out. Or tell me it's fucking awful. Honesty is a virtue 



His apartment was near campus, not particularly small. Nonetheless, his solitude was obvious in every room.
The bathroom was sparsely furnished. The vanity, with its narrow enamel basin, had seen better days. In several places, the white coating had peeled off, and especially around the faucet, the surface was worn and shabby. 
As I sat there, on the closed toilet lid, legs crossed, my sandals - the soles were far too narrow - resting on the floor before me, I found myself wondering if he’d ever had a woman in this apartment.                                                                                                            Nothing even remotely suggested it.
I got up and walked barefoot across to the vanity. Above it, a mirrored cabinet. I opened it - the hinge squeaked - and found only a few items inside, half of which didn’t even belong in a bathroom.
A bottle of mouthwash stood next to a toothbrush; in a glass an old comb, and beside it a notepad, most pages torn out.                                       
On top of it were three pencils, two of which were useless — one had a broken tip, the other was too short. There was also a bottle of his aftershave, the scent of which I could only tolerate in the smallest of doses.
On the grimy shelf at the bottom of the cabinet lay a tarnished wristwatch. I remember raising my eyebrows when I first saw it — it was so dainty, so unmistakably feminine, but the strap was too short to have belonged to any adult woman. No, it looked like a child’s watch, and as I examined it more closely, I recognized the faded design of a Flik Flak: a zigzag pattern with tiny crooked stars and hearts scattered between the lines.
I placed the watch back on the shelf and closed the cabinet with a slight, mildly repulsed deliberation.                                                                                  
I looked at myself in the mirror. Then, I reached into my handbag on the windowsill and pulled out rouge and lipstick, applying both with a kind of relaxed laziness. I looked at myself one last time, then decided not to keep him waiting any longer.
He was sitting on the couch, reading an article from one of the newspapers he’d left on the coffee table. I sat down silently beside him, peering over his shoulder with feigned interest. He lay his hand on my thigh, then took it away. 
“Would you like something to drink?” he asked, and I smiled, first looking into his eyes, then at his nose, then his lips.
“Maybe a coffee.”
He got up and went to the kitchen, making no sign that I should follow. I rose anyway and trotted after him.
The kitchen was just as sparsely furnished as everything else. On the counter sat a coffee machine, next to it a hook with linen towels, a knife block, and a wooden cutting board.
As the machine hummed, he went to the fridge.
“Milk? Sugar?”
I normally took mine with lots of milk and three spoons of sugar.
“Nothing. Just black.”
He nodded solemnly, and when the machine had filled the white cup halfway, he placed it in front of me. Then he sat down across from me at the kitchen table, flanked by three chairs. For a literary man, he had surprisingly good posture - his back wasn’t hunched or slouched. His hands rested flat on the table, his dark hair was neatly combed, and he looked like the cliché of what he was: mysterious, and - at that moment - deeply unsettling. I looked at him, then down at the coffee.
“You know, this kind of situation isn’t all that unusual.”
“Yeah. I know.”
“You’re quite pretty, you know that?”
He stood and walked over to the window across from the table. He pulled a cigarette case from his trouser pocket and lit one with a match from the sill. He looked at me. Then his gaze subverted stoically to the  wall.
“Are you a virgin?”
The bluntness of the question hit like a slap to the back of my neck, and I looked back down at the cup. The combination of strong coffee, cigarette smoke, and that unbearable aftershave made me nauseous.
“Yes,” I lied, assuming that was the preferred answer. But I was wrong - for a split second, a flicker of shame or disgust crossed his drawn face before disappearing, replaced by a look of interest.
“Remind me, what was the short story we analyzed last month?”
“Which one do you mean? The one with the dying cat or—?”
“No, not that one.” He cut me off as he remembered.
“For Esmé – with Love and Squalor.”
“Right. For Esmé – with Love and Squalor.”
“Did you like it?”
“Very much. But I already knew it.”
I took a sip of the now lukewarm coffee. It tasted awful, and I masked my revulsion with a dry cough.
‘’Its a very sad story But very pretty. The last sentences, they just shake you’’, dragged more pürolonged at the cigarette, until he noticed my coughing fit.
“Should I stop smoking?” he asked, a hint of concern in his voice, and I shook my head.
“No, its fine, doesn’t bother me.”
He looked at me as if I were an unsolvable paradox.


“I’m guessing you like Salinger?”
“In parts. I didn’t like The Catcher in the Rye. But I do like his stories about the Glass family.”
“Yeah? Well, young women usually aren’t very receptive to Salinger. Especially not to Catcher in the Rye.”
“Mhm.”
“You could tell in the lecture, too. How many of your classmates pulled a face.”


“Mh-hm,” I nodded and grinned. I had seen their faces and I had felt a sense of superiority over them. 
“Do you have a favorite story of his?”, I asked, one finger playing with the pearl teardrop of my earring, in an attempt to calm my nervous system through plastic material.

He looked at me, walked back to the table, sat down across from me, and kept smoking. I liked looking at him like that much better - I was almost staring - then he took my hand in his.
“For Esmé. Or A Girl I Knew. Do you have one? A favorite, I mean.”


“Teddy and Franny. He writes children wonderfully’’.


""Hm. It fits you, really.”
‘’Does it?’’, I asked and smiled weakly. His hand was warm and I held mine as still as I could without going stiff. I feared he would pull away any second.
He laughed and squeezed my hand a little tighter, traced his thumb over my ring finger. I wore a slim silver ring with a heart-shaped stone inlay. He circled its edges.
“You know, Salinger likes his partners younger. A lot of writers and academics do. I mean,” - he took a drag from his cigarette and blew the smoke beside me, careful not to blow it in my face -
“- obviously I can’t speak for everyone; but maybe it has to do with innocence. Sometimes -” it seemed like he was searching for the right words.


“Sometimes it feels like the whole world’s gone completely to hell, and all that’s pure and beautiful has been lost. And then you meet someone,” he squeezed my hand tighter, “who proves the opposite. And maybe she’s younger. But spiritually, she’s on the same level.
I think that’s the fascination with women like you - one that Salinger and I share.”


“Mhm.”


“On that level, Salinger and I are quite similar. He’s also a very reserved man.”
We looked at each other for a brief moment, then I turned my coffee cup in my hands.

“But you’re not Salinger,” I said, looking at him intently. Nervousness rose up in me, and I couldn’t suppress it.
He let go of my hand and stubbed his cigarette out in my cup. Then he stood.
“No. Of course I’m not.”
He took the half-full cup and let the coffee drain down in the sink. His dreamy manner had shifted into a kind of irritated, manic energy.


“I’ll tidy up. You can go ahead into the bedroom.”


I looked at him and listened, but a kind of ressentiment in my head prevented me from standing up. It was as if I was simply glued to the chair.
‘’Should i help?’’
‘’You don't need to. You only drank coffee. My main issue is that I need the goddamn smoke out of the room before my housekeeper comes and berates me for it again. Just move to the bedroom now, i will be there in a minute’’.

I stood up abruptly, as if his words had been a form of Acetone, and left the kitchen in a slow and sluggish manner. The way to the bedroom was not familiar but as I crossed the bathroom, right next to it was the bedroom door, wide open. 

His bed was neatly made, next to it stood a table and on it several books, a cup and a bright red phone. It was the only thing that gave the room any color, really and as I sat down, I stared towards the bookshelf standing at least 6 feet in the room. At 19, I was slightly nearsighted and couldn't read any of the titles, but they were all bound in leather. 

I unbuttoned the blouse and let it passively slide to the ground. Then I took off the bralette, so embarrassed, I could only continue staring at the wall. As I unclasped, it also fell down to the blouse, and I lay down in the bed.
 
I pulled the blanket up to my sides until it covered my chest fully, only stopping at my collarbone. Then I neatly tucked it in.
He stood at the door, merely for a second, and I hadn't noticed him in my tucking endeavor, until he spoke.

‘’Take the blanket down, you're not five for god's sake’’

I blinked. He walked over and pulled, yanked the blanket down and revealed my bare upper body. Then his gaze shifted from my face to my chest, and he, still fully dressed, lay beside me.
One hand he placed on my stomach,the other behind my head. He leant in for a small, unerotic kiss and then looked at me.But it seems like he didn't really look at me. He just looked at my nose, then back down to my lips and kissed me again, with a form of reverence.

This continued on, the kisses, five by count, becoming more indulgent, until I clearly tasted tobacco and saliva. 

And i just couldn't stand it

Around this same time I had been ramping up my coffee intake.  I was already drinking it often, but started adding more.

Then a few days later I woke up with a sinus headache and instead of making my normal coffee just pounded zero sugar soda all day.  The weird kindling related symptoms went away.  I also noticed the mild depression hanging over my life went away too.

Missing coffee I ended up making some and the depression came back.  Switch back to soda, low grade depression gone again.  Fast forward - last night made a coffee.  Not long after feeling agitated for about 2hr.  This never happens with soda, only coffee.  And I drink a heroic amount of caffeine via soda.  It's not uncommon for me to wake up and have 2x or 3x sugar free soda within 1 hr (including Mountain Dew which has high caffeine content).

Coffee does stuff to the brain that caffeine alone does not.  I am not anti-coffee.  I love coffee, but unfortunately have to give it up.

I am 33 years old I started off at 220 lbs last year and was a heavy drinker. I hadn't done a workout in 15 years. But last year I quit drinking And I started dieting and got down to 202 lbs just from dieting for 100 days. Than I started eating like crazy and went back up to 217 lbs. Since I have started this new routine I am back Down to 211 lbs. No alcohol. Eating out maybe once a week.
Im averaging about 600-700 reps a day. So far I have only taken 1 day off and that was in the first week.
Ultimate goal is just to lose weight, improve flexibility, motion, strength and heal old joints, and back pain caused from surgeries, a vehicle wreck, and a motorcycle wreck nearly 15 years ago.
My current work out routine is 6-7 things. sets of 20. 5 sets to make 100. Sometimes I just throw in random stuff that I'm feeling that day and might get closer to 1000 reps which is where I want to be at - 1000/day.

So I currently have
Even days (legs/cardio)
100 lunge
100 squats
100 leg lifts
100 side to side lunge
100 high knees
100 jumping jacks

 For odd days (arms/abs)
100 ez push ups on my office desk
100 second plank
With 15 lbs 
100 axe chops
100 curls 
100 shoulder press
100 toe touches
100 overhead reachback

I thought I was going to hit burnout this last weekend but I pushed through with a 2-300 rep workout each day.

I normally walk my dog for 45 minutes on top of this but he just tore his acl sadly. I'm still trying to get at least 6,000 steps in. On a busy day at work I sometimes hit 15,000 steps.

I plan to add a 7 mile bike ride 2-3x a week.

Diet looks like:
Mostly all water but 
530: 32oz coffee with creamer (I know)
630: meal prepped egg mcmuffins (sausage, bacon, or ham)
730: fresh fruit yogurt and granola
900: brocolli with low calorie ranch (35 calories)
11: leftover dinner for lunch
530 dinner: which is typically like meat, rice, and veggies. We do fish once a week. Steak once a week. Sometimes we make wraps. Or tuna fish sandwiches. Chicken cheesesteaks. Burritos. Homemade Chinese food. We love macaroni salad lol.
I probably eat an ice cream sandwich 2-3 times a week for dessert.
I cook pretty much all of our meals and I have been trying to cut back on how much olive oil I use. Once a week we might get fast food or a digornos pizza if we are being lazy and dont want to cook and clean.

I thought about saving my last workout set for 730pm and than taking a melatonin at 8pm with a protein drink. 

I think thats it. If you have read all of this, I thank you for taking the time to read it. Any help along my journey is greatly appreciated. Let me know though, How am I doing!? ",1,1750098535.0,beginnerfitness,4,1.0,False

I didn’t feel comfortable in my body, my clothes weren’t fitting right, and my relationship with food was all over the place. I had a summer vacation planned for July, and wanted to feel good in my body by then, so I decided to try and slim down.

I’m still about ~20 lbs away from my goal (160 lbs) but this is the first time I’ve actually noticed a difference (the blessing/curse of being kind of tall).

Here’s what has worked for me so far: 

Eating routinely:
First of all, I’m lazy. I won’t cook myself a nice healthy breakfast every morning. So instead, I drink a protein/meal replacement shake. Something low-cal, high-protein, with lots of vitamins and nutrients. (I like Soylent and Nurri the best.)
For lunch, I’ll eat a frozen high-protein meal, I like Amy’s or Lean Cuisine. It’s easy for me to take to the office, and doesn’t take a lot of brainpower.
For dinner, I’ll cook/prep one big tasty meal on Monday and portion it out to eat through it the week. Things like pork tacos on low-carb tortillas, Greek orzo salad with meatballs, etc
Zero-Calorie drinks only, like black coffee, green tea, flavored seltzers, and Diet Coke (which is usually my dessert lol)
On the weekends, I’m way more relaxed but still track calories. And I try to just do 2 meals a day, so I can eat larger portions.
During the week I shoot for ~1300 cals/day, on the weekends it’s more like ~1600.

Exercise:
10k steps a day is literally a cheat code!! I track them with my Apple Watch.
I try to walk about 3 miles during my lunch break, and if I don’t hit 10k then I walk on my walking pad at home while I watch tv (got mine on Amazon for $100)
I do reformer Pilates about 2 times/week, but not the high intensity kind. The place I go to focuses more on posture/flexibility, and I feel like it’s good for my mental health and feeling grounded/present in my body.
Once per week I go for a 3 mile jog.
And on the weekend I like to do something fun like a hike or long bike ride.


Tips: 
-For those moments when you open the fridge and just want something, have zero/low calorie options! Costco has these zero calorie fizzy drinks that taste like fruity soda, and they have honestly replaced snacks for me. Also when I want something savory, Chomps has 35 cal turkey sticks, or babybell light cheeses are only 45 cal
-I weigh myself every Monday morning. It keeps me on track and makes me excited when I hit my goal! I have a smart scale (from Amazon) that tracks your weight over the years and I can go back and see my progress. It also tracks a lot of other cool things like muscle mass/etc.
-any time I lose weight, I notice my hair and skin suffer. I think this is just a result of being in a deficit and not getting enough nutrients. So make sure you’re taking a vitamin or supplement and take extra care of yourself.

1ld0kj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SeanWil69/comments/1ld0kj3/chapter_3_cracks_in_the_ice/,Chapter 3 - Cracks in the Ice,"Tyler’s alarm went off at 7:00 a.m., but he’d been awake since 4:00.

The ache in his knee started as a dull throb, then bloomed into something sharp and hot, radiating up his thigh like fire under the skin. He’d pushed it too hard yesterday — lifting crates, climbing ladders, pretending to be fine when every muscle screamed otherwise.

He sat on the edge of the bed, jaw clenched, sweat already prickling at his neck. The small orange bottle on the nightstand stared back at him. He was down to half the pills he brought from Michigan, and he hadn’t figured out how to refill them here yet. Officially, he wasn’t supposed to be taking them at all anymore.

But official rules didn’t account for days like this.

He shook out two pills, paused, then added a third. Wasn’t like he had a game to play.

After a long shower and a pathetic attempt at breakfast — dry toast and black coffee — he pulled on jeans and a hoodie and limped his way down to the gallery.

The pain eased slightly by the time he reached the front door, the tram ride a blur. He leaned on the counter for support and forced himself to breathe evenly. Normal. Be normal.

The gallery smelled like fresh paint and varnish, and that weird clay scent Sasha always seemed to carry around with her. He’d half-hoped she wouldn’t be there yet — that he’d have time to level out — but she was already in the back room, sleeves rolled up, perched on a stool surrounded by swirls of color and canvases that looked like dreams caught in motion.

She looked up, smiling.

“Morning, McAdams. You’re late.”

“Am I?” He checked his watch. “Blame Deutsche Bahn.”

She snorted, eyes playful. “Always.”

He stepped forward, trying not to limp. The pills were starting to hit now — not in the warm, fuzzy way they used to, but in a slightly off-kilter, almost-too-quiet kind of way. His head felt a half-second behind his body.

Sasha stood and handed him a box of tools.

“Think you can handle hanging the two pieces in the north wing? I’d do it myself, but Peter said they were heavy and apparently I’m ‘delicate.’”

Tyler smirked. “Sure. Just don’t sue me if I drop them.”

He followed her into the main room, the weight of the box burning in his arms more than it should have. The pieces were big, abstract paintings with strange metallic textures — beautiful, but oddly cold. Like Sasha’s work on a bad day.

She hovered nearby, occasionally offering input, occasionally watching him too closely.

“You okay?” she asked casually as he stepped back to straighten one of the paintings.

“Yeah,” he lied. “Just didn’t sleep.”

“Hmm.” She tilted her head. “You’re moving like you’re underwater.”

Tyler winced as he bent down for the level. “Old hockey injury.”

Sasha narrowed her eyes. “You’re twenty-two. That injury looks newer than that.”

He didn’t answer right away, focused on aligning the frame. Silence stretched. His head swam a little, and he overcompensated, sending the piece slightly crooked again.

She stepped forward, gently taking the level from his hand.

“You know, you don’t have to impress me.”

“I’m not,” he said quickly, sharper than intended.

She didn’t flinch. “Good. Because you already did.”

He blinked at her. “What?”

“Yesterday,” she said, setting the level down. “You didn’t talk about yourself once. That’s rare in guys.”

Tyler gave a half-laugh. “I’m more interesting when I’m not talking.”

“Are you?” she challenged, her smile small. “Because I’m starting to think you’re hiding the best parts.”

That stopped him. The worst part was — she was right. And she didn’t even know how right.

He stepped back, needing space, needing air. The world tilted a bit to the left. He gripped the wall, playing it off like he was studying the frame.

“You’re engaged,” he said suddenly, the words cutting the air like a blade. “Shouldn’t you be saving that kind of line for someone else?”

Sasha blinked, surprised. Then her expression shifted — something softer, more careful.

“Just because I’m engaged doesn’t mean I’m blind. Or immune to… curiosity.”

He turned to face her, and for a second, it was like the gallery faded — the noise, the light, even the ache in his knee. She looked at him like she saw more than the broken player. More than the walking disappointment.

She saw him.

That terrified him more than anything else.

“I should finish these,” he muttered, stepping away.

“Okay,” she said, letting him go.

But as he worked, he could still feel her eyes on him — curious, concerned, maybe even a little drawn in. And every time he shifted his weight, every time his knee twinged or the pills made the walls hum, he reminded himself of two things:

One — Sasha was completely off limits.
Two — if he wasn’t careful, he was going to fall anyway.

New nurse + new crush = chaos","
Dr. Amani: genius, gorgeous… and always vanishing the second I say hi.

Plan A: locker notes.

“Did you hear about the doc who loved a nurse? He needed a lot of ‘heart’ meds.”

She laughed, then disappeared again.

Plan B: food diplomacy. After a night shift I drop her favorite snack—piping-hot samosas—on the break-room table.

“You might need a pick-me-up,” I mumble.

She grins: “You’re less annoying than I thought.” Ice = cracked.

Cue weeks of shared charts, midnight coffee, and stolen glances. I learn she wants to be a surgeon, loves adventure, and can actually sing soprano over the monitor alarms.

Finally, during lunch:

“Amani, dinner this weekend?”

She freezes… then smiles. “I’d love to.”

Moral: persistence, jokes, and samosas can resuscitate even the coldest crush. Wish me luck for date night!",1,1750098294.0,subreddit,0,1.0,False
1ld0jw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ld0jw9/i_feed_the_thing_that_lives_with_me/,I Feed the Thing That Lives With Me,"I just moved in. The apartment hunt was mental. Rents went way up from my uni days when I was last hunting for them. I finally found a nice cozy apartment I could have, even though I never met the actual owner... after searching for a while, I just stopped and decided to ask in every call if they got anything cheaper... and finally, this one guy did.  
  
He just said: *""Hey, actually, I do, I have this place but no one actually stays in it for long, and it’s a fixer-upper, so you can have it for 180 a month.""*  This worked for me.  
  
He sent me the contract via email and left the keys in a postbox... which was super weird. But everything seemed legit, and it works for me because... well...I don’t talk to people anymore, I dont like to talk to people. I dont like...people. It didn’t happen all at once—no dramatic falling out or grand isolation. Just a quiet slipping away. Messages stopped. Calls dried up. The kind of silence that grows naturally when no one bothers to fight for friendships anymore... And maybe I stopped fighting too. I just needed to get away from everything, it was exhausting me. The fake smiles I needed to wear for every dinner, event, or any social gathering.... I just realized I’m better off being alone, without needing to fake my state of mind. And it finally worked, I was finally at peace,   
  
\-""happy"".-

The apartment is small. Two rooms. I know now why it is so cheap - the heat doesn’t work and the hallway light’s been flickering since I moved in. The landlord doesn’t care, and neither do I. I keep the curtains drawn. I cook what I can afford. I don’t look in the mirror much, and I don’t really care about it, I’m not a social person, and.... I don’t go out much. Issue is - I also do not sleep well. I always had an issue with that, so most nights I just spend on the couch, watching Netflix, followed by a morning coffee and back to the day at hand. There’s even a worn spot on the couch cushion that fits me perfectly. That’s my place now.

But there is also one thing I didn’t mention. There, in the corner. It’s the far left one, just behind the bookshelf I never finished unpacking. I use the boxes of books as chairs at this point. That’s where it stays. I didn’t notice it at first. When I first moved in I just lived in the chaos. The idea was to just sort things out as I go. At first I thought it was a pile of laundry I’d forgotten to sort, but when I tried to move it, my hand passed through something soft that resisted—like pressing into a pillow that pushes back, except colder. Damp, maybe. It didn’t make sense. But since I was lacking sleep for basically my whole life, the idea of my mind playing tricks on me wasn’t really new.  
  
\-So I left it.-

The next day it was sitting a little straighter.  I think. The shape was still low to the ground, maybe two feet tall at best, like a lump with no real features, but now it had... posture? That was the first time I looked at it for more than a second. It didn’t seem like anything much really, it was like a weird ragdoll-ish stuffed bear to keep me company. In a strange way, it made the room feel less empty.  
I started calling it Mop. Not because it looked like one, exactly—more because I didn’t know what else to name a small, lumpy presence in the corner that just… sat there, and didn’t go away. At this point I figured, maybe it's not just in my mind, it’s there, for a while now. I just kind of got used to it through ignoring it for most of the time. I just shrugged it, and whatever it is, it beats a plant - People talking to plants are weird. Mop didn’t react to its name, but I found myself talking to it anyway. Like a roommate I wasn’t sure existed. “Hey, Mop. You eat dreams or just leftover sadness?” Or, “I dropped spaghetti on the floor. That’s your problem now.” The more I joked, the more I felt like... like it was listening.  
  
\-I'm probably losing my mind again.-

One night, I left a slice of toast on a napkin near the corner. Not out of fear—more like a joke... a joke of realization I was a sad guy with no one to talk to but a few rags in the corner. I said, “Here. Freeloaders get crumbs.” The next morning, the toast was gone. Napkin too. No crumbs, no mess. Nothing.  
It wasn’t mice, I got rid of those when I moved in, as well as patched the holes in the walls. That was the first time I understood that maybe...just maybe....it could actually.... move? I didn’t panic. I wasn’t even surprised. I think a part of me had already accepted that Mop was real before I wanted to say it out loud. And more than that—it was staying. I didn’t mind. It wasn’t hurting anything. If anything, it made the space feel a little less empty, a little less lonely. It was a crazy guy's imaginary friend that replaces normal people’s companions... like dogs, cats... or cactus. And... I shrugged and just kept feeding it leftovers.   
  
\-“A dog,” I said to myself, “it’s basically, kind of... a weird... dog.” and shrugged.-

As the days passed, it started to change. Not drastically. Just small shifts. It would be closer to the couch some mornings, or perched slightly higher like it had grown an inch overnight, it was weird. Its shape got a little smoother, a little more defined, like a melted snowman slowly reforming. At some point, I noticed it had two soft-looking stubs—like arms? No fingers. Just rounded bumps like plush limbs sewn onto a stuffed animal. Am I losing my mind? Am actualy falling a sleep and sleepwalking? Eating leftovers and sewing laundry parts onto a... sewn together bunch of laundry?

Then – then it was the first time it moved while I was looking. I had just come back from a walk, an errand i had to run - soaked in rain and sick with exhaustion. I collapsed onto the couch without a word, face down into a pillow. After a few minutes, I felt something nudge against my shin. Not hard—just a bump. When I opened my eyes, Mop was a few inches closer than it had been. Its little arms were drawn in like a child hugging its knees. It looked... concerned. I didn’t move. Just whispered, “I’m okay.” It didn’t reply. But it didn’t leave, either. I'm going mental again, I'm imagining things again... but, then it blinked. I jumped, gasped, and then, I don’t really know... I just kind of... accepted that I am going crazy? I am not sure—am I going crazy? But if I am crazy, I might just as well accept it and go on, it’s not like anyone will notice it... From then on, it followed me from room to room. Always in the corner. Always where it wouldn’t be seen from the windows. Sometimes I’d catch it staring—not in a threatening way, more like a dog watching its owner with quiet focus. I’d eat dinner, and Mop would be nearby. I’d read in bed, and Mop would be tucked in the corner, faintly rocking side to side. This went on for a while. I guess I do have a pet. I just can't... walk it... or show it... who would I show it to anyway? And why would I walk it...   
  
\-This suits me.-

I didn’t feed it every day. But when I did, the food always disappeared. Then... It started purring. Or something like purring. A low, rhythmic hum that filled the room like the inside of a seashell. I guess it’s not a dog, I guess I'm a cat person after all. And I just accepted it again. It’s a weird-ass cat. Yes. It also makes sense as it didn’t really like to touch or to be touched... cats are assholes. But then it would cuddle next to me... Weird-ass cat. \**sigh\** . I’d be halfway through a sentence, reading some old fantasy novel out loud, and it would start vibrating gently, like it was pleased. It was cute, in a strange way. Like a cat. I really do need to define it, it’s weird I redefine it every so often. Yes, this is final... it’s a cat... a cat with no mouth and too many thoughts, but it’s a cat. My cat. My weird, creepy, strange, cat.

One night, I had a breakdown. No real reason. Not that I needed one, not that it was so uncommon... but it was... more than usual. Just the accumulation of things—life, memory, a crushing sense of uselessness. I sat on the bathroom floor with the lights off, crying into my sleeves, and for the first time in months, I wanted someone—anyone—to knock on the door. Someone to care.  
  
\-Instead, something warm touched my back. I turned slowly.-  
  
Mop was there, pressed against the frame, just barely tall enough to reach me. One stubby arm rested on my shoulder. It didn’t feel slimy or heavy. Just soft. Solid. Like someone small trying to comfort someone falling apart. It was so fragile, so gentle, I didn’t say anything. I didn’t need to. I just leaned into it. I think it stayed there all night. Then I realized it cared for me far more than I cared for... *it.?* I was dismissing it, not even admitting it was there on a daily basis, still feeding it as a joke.... sometimes I just kicked it out of the way, and it just curled into a corner. But... From that day on, I fed it daily. Real meals. Bowls with broth, bits of chicken, steamed rice. Sometimes eggs. I always made more and made sure to share with it. And it never left a trace. I started leaving out books too. Mop never opened them, but I think it liked the idea of stories. I’d read aloud while it listened, swaying gently or curling tighter when the characters were in danger. This gentle little thing that I couldn’t explain. What if I told someone? Would someone take it away as a wild animal? But it wasn’t an animal... it was... rags? I still don’t know what it is, but I knew I had to take care of it.

It never made a sound. Not once. But I never doubted it understood me. I stopped thinking of it as a thing or a creature. It was just... Mop. My Mop.

Then one day, one strange day, if \*STRANGE\* can be described as different at this point, someone probably decided it’s worth checking that lone lighted apartment in an otherwise pretty empty building. I heard breaking in the main entrance door with a crowbar, I heard steps coming up, squeaking floorboards.... It was around midnight. I was awake, reading on the couch, Mop curled in its corner with an apple in a bowl beside it. The lock rattled once. Then again.   
  
**-A heavy, deliberate push followed. -**  
  
Someone on the other side whispered something I couldn’t make out.  
I froze. I didn’t have anything to defend myself with. No bat. No knife. My phone was across the room, and my legs wouldn’t move. As defunct as I am, this scared me out of my mind. A sudden flash of clarity, or reality – I am in danger?  
  
The door creaked open. Just a few inches. Enough to see a foot—booted. Heavy. Then a hand wearing leather gloves pushed it further and a man stepped into the room. Pale. Blank-eyed. A black hoodie. I am not sure what he came for, but I guess he saw me... or the place as easy pickings on whatever he could get. People get by how they can—he wasn’t frantic like you'd expect, just... there, like breaking into homes was his shift, and I was just his task for this night.... there is no rest for the wicked.

He didn’t speak. He didn’t demand money. He just raised a long kitchen knife and stepped forward. I guess he didn’t expect me to be there. Or awake. I couldn’t even scream.   
  
Then Mop moved. As scared as I was, my mind now focused on how I need to save him! He was helpless, I needed to do something, I needed to protect him somehow! But then Mop moved slightly forward again. It didn’t leap. It didn’t make a sound. It just...   
  
\-**unfolded-.**  
  
It grew taller, not in the way things stretch, but like a shadow deepening, if I can describe it in this way. Its shape swelled until it filled half the room, like its devouring walls... like growing over the walls, eyes opening where no eyes had been, and more... and more, every wall turned into a black shadow with more eyes than I could count—glowing faintly like stars in deep fog. Its stubby arms became wings or veils or something in between, I froze, no... I was paralyzed!  It didn’t move, it didn't attack.  
It simply **-was-.**  
  
The man stopped mid-step, looking around him, looking up, while his knife hit the floor. He was terrified. He tried to turn, but the room **-bent-** around him. The shadow covered his legs up to his waist, the light grew dim and sharp all at once. The air folded inward like a vacuum closing, like reality was twisting into a point, and then **-darkness-**.... for a moment that felt like forever, and the next moment - he was gone.  
\-No sound. No scream. No trace. As if the world had corrected a mistake.-  
  
Mop shrank back to its original size, curled into its old shape and rolled quietly into the corner like nothing had happened. I sat on the couch and sat there for hours, unable to move. I didn’t ask what it was. I didn’t need to. I didn’t know, but nothing can explain this, nothing could, nothing needed to.... It had chosen to protect me.

The next morning, the bowl was empty, and Mop blinked up at me.   
  
\-**It smiled.-**  
  
Not with a mouth, it had none, but with its entire being. A soft warmth radiated from it like a hug held at a distance. I think it was proud of itself.  And I...I wasn't afraid of Mop. Not of Mop. Not really.  
I was afraid of what I didn’t understand. Afraid of what it had the power to become—and the fact that it chose not to. It could have unmade the world if it wanted to. Bend reality to its will.  
But it didn’t. It stayed small. Kind. Patient. Quiet.   
  
It let me talk down to it. Let me feed it like a pet. Let me insult it, laugh at it, ignore it on bad days, even kicked it. It accepted all of it. Because it wanted to stay. And I don’t know why it chose me. But I don't know what would’ve happened if it hadn’t.  
  
So I feed it now. Properly. Lovingly. I clean the bowls now, even though I do not understand how it feeds. I speak gently. I read with feeling. I never leave it alone for too long. And when I have bad nights, I let it curl up near my bed, just out of sight. 

Not because it needs me.   
But because it’s choosing not to need more.  
*Because it’s choosing to be small.*   
Because it let me live

How does it make sense to buy such small amounts of coffee bags when you know that three if not four shots are wasted while dialing in, and then what is left is at best 10 other espresso shots out of the whole bag before you have to open another expensive bag and go through the same exact process again…

Wouldn’t it make more sense to purchase 500gr or even 1 kg of beans instead, and once dialed in you get to enjoy it for longer and get the best bang for your bucks - while you slowly grinder finer as it starts to turn stale?

Is specialty coffee generally more forgiving, i.e., even when not dialed in properly, it still tastes better than most commercial and old roasted beans?

Right now we live in a 2 bedroom apartment on the fourth floor where all the doors in the apartment are left open, so he has full roam of the house. He's fully indoor although I've taken him out on a leash walk a handful of times. He likes to chill in the same room as me but in a different part of the room (eg he'll be on the desk if I'm in bed, or he'll be under the coffee table if I'm on the sofa). He has lots of toys and we play fetch with his mice etc. He's never really been a scratcher and doesn't really use scratch boards.

The room we'll be moving into will be quite small compared to the current apartment. It's about the size of my current bedroom. It has an en-suite where I'll have his litter box. I am planning on bringing both of his cat trees to try and maximise vertical space. He will have two window sills to look out of. Unfortunately he can't have free roam of the house as all of the doors are fire doors so they need to be kept closed when not in use. I can't put any shelves up as I'm only renting the room for a year.

What advice do you have to help me make this an easier transition for him? I'm worried about the space feeling cramped for him and him being bored by being stuck in one room. The place we are moving to is a bit more rural so I've considered taking him out for walks and hikes to entertain him/tire him out. I wouldn't be able to let him be an outdoor cat though, as there is no safe way for him to get in and out of the house/shared room independently and the house is near a very busy street.

It’s not what it looks like. I smile and....","**Chapter 1**  
 Walking into the lobby of the hotel, the warm air hits me in the face. It’s October and I can already tell that winter is going to be rough. The lady behind the counter looks up from her computer with a look of shock on her face. I can’t blame her. I look like I feel which is crap. Oh, honey are you okay?” she asks. I hate that question. I'm fine. ” I try to smile. “I need a room. Something that’s dog friendly, if you have it.  Of course,” she says, looking back down at her computer and typing. “How many nights? Just one.  I lean on the counter, feeling the exhaustion of the last few days catching up to me.  
Room 312 is dog friendly. You just take the elevator to the third floor and take a right. It will be seventy for the night and a fifty dollar deposit for the dog.  I hand over my card. Waiting for her to finish checking us in, I look down at my new companion. I can’t believe that he saved my life.  
 From what I can remember, I was attacked and he came out of nowhere, jumping on the guy attacking me. The cops said that if it wasn’t for him, I probably would have been killed or in a coma. Instead, I just had a concussion, two broken ribs and a sprained wrist.  Beast was the first thing I saw when I woke up in that alley with the smell of garbage and urine all around me. I thought I was dead until I heard whining and felt a warm, wet tongue move across my face. I opened my eyes to see a huge face looking down on me like some kind of doggie angel. He stayed at my side while I gathered my strength to get up. He never, even when I stumbled into the apartment to call the police. He was my own personal guardian through every moment. Here you go, honey,” she says, handing me the room card. “The elevator is right down that hall. ” She points to the left. Thanks,” I mumble, ready to get into bed. I know that it’s none of my business,” she says and I stop to look at her. “I hope that you were able to get in a few licks before you left his ass. It’s not what it looks like. ” I smile and shake my head. Mmm humm, honey. If you say so.   I don’t have it in me to argue with her so I just let it go and smile. “Come on, boy. ” I drag Beast along with me towards the elevator while trying to carry my bag. “You can smell everything in the morning when I'm not so tired,” I say through a yawn while pulling him behind me.  When we finally reach our room, I'm overwhelmed by the smell of dog urine. I wondered why they take fifty dollars if they were obviously not using it to get the smell out of the carpet. I’m too tired at this point to care and just happy to have a bed. We could sleep in my car but with all of my stuff stuffed in it, there’s not a lot of room. I take Beast’s leash off and go to the bathroom, carrying my bag with me.  
  
  After brushing my teeth and washing my face, I look in the mirror and cringe. I look like a cow. My face is black and blue, my green eyes are red and puffy, my upper lip is cut, and I have so many bruises that even my hair hurts. I pull off my jeans, sweater and bra but keep on my tank top and panties then crawl into bed. Leaning over, I turn off the light. Two seconds later, I feel the bed bounce with Beast’s huge body as he curls into me. And then I'm out.  
  
  The sun is shining through the crack in the curtain. I moan and roll over. Beast is lying on his back with his legs straight up in the air, and he’s snoring. He is the strangest dog I’ve ever met. Not that I have a lot of experience with dogs. I’ve always tried to avoid them. When I was four, we went to visit one of my mom’s friends out in the Hamptons. They had a dog that attacked me. I ended up in the hospital with stitches from my eyebrow to the corner of my eye. Ever since then, I’ve had a deep fear of dogs. Including the small ones that everyone thinks are so cute because they look like you could put them in your pocket. My dog, Beast, is not small. I Googled dog photos after I found him and from what I can tell, he’s a Great Dane. He comes up to my waist when he is standing on all fours. I'm five four and when he stands on his back paws, his head is a good four inches above mine. Surprisingly, I'm not afraid of him at all. Actually, I don’t think I would have made it through the last couple days without him.  
  
  “Come on, buddy,” I say as I pat his stomach. He rolls his body to the side, looking at me like I'm crazy. “Yeah, it’s time to wake up and get back on the road if we want to make it to Dad’s by tonight,” I say while getting out of bed. He still doesn’t move.  
  
  “Whatever. I'm going to shower,” I tell him like he cares. Stumbling my way into the bathroom, I start the shower. As steam fills up the small room, I take off my tank top and panties and climb in. Peeling the paper off the cheap hotel soap, I wash my body. After I’ve washed from head to toe, trying to be careful around the cuts on my legs and arms, I find the shampoo but realize there’s no conditioner. I regret not digging through the stuff in the car last night to find all my bathroom supplies. Getting out and drying off, I try to finger comb my hair enough that I won’t look totally crazy when we make our way down to check out. Not that it will matter, I laugh to myself.  
  
  One look at my face and no one will care what my hair looks like. I find a clean bra and panties and sweats. I throw on a hoodie and put my hair up in a messy knot at the top of my head then slide my sunglasses up to rest on my head till we get downstairs. Walking out of the bathroom, Beast is sitting on the bed, looking like he has been waiting for me forever. Typical male.  
  
  “Come on, boy. Let’s roll. ” I pat my leg and he jumps down from the bed to walk over to me. Sitting at my feet, he waits for me to attach his leash. “Okay, sweet boy, I’ll feed you outside,” I say while double-checking the bathroom to make sure I didn’t leave anything. Walking to the elevator, with beast in tow, I slow down so he can smell everything that he missed last night.  
  
  The elevator opens up and the person stepping out almost stumbles at the sight of Beast. I mean, he is big but he is not that scary looking. His fur is dark gray with black spots, his nose is pink with black spots and his eyes are almost blue. He’s actually really beautiful. I give the guy a look and apologize. “Maybe my face is what scared him,” I say to Beast when the elevator door closes. He tilts his head in agreement. Once on the first floor with the elevator door open, there’s enough light to put on my sunglasses so I slide them down my face.  
  
  Walking to the checkout, I notice there is a new desk clerk. I’m praying we don’t have to have another uncomfortable conversation. That’s when I spot a key card drop box and make my way to it without a second look at the front desk.  
  
  Once I drop my key inside, the smell of coffee hits me. My feet move without my command to the source of my weakness. I love coffee. I drink so much coffee every day that my coffee consumption alone could support a small country. Coffee in hand and a bagel hanging out of my mouth, we make our way out to my car. Outside, the cold air hits my lungs and it feels amazing. I walk to my other baby, my light blue convertible VW bug. I pop the trunk and drop my bag inside then dig out Beast's food and water bowl and set them down on the ground. Leaning against my car, I watch Beast scarf down his food while I enjoy mine. Once he’s done, I put his bowls back in the car and take him to the grassy area near the parking lot to take care of his business. I lay down in the cold grass, looking up into the sky and all I can think is in a just few hours, my life is going to be so different.  
  
  \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
  
  Driving is not fun. Okay, let’s be clear, driving in “my” car with a giant beast of a dog, going from New York to Tennessee is not fun. My car is small and with all my stuff packed in the trunk and the back seat, there is no room for Beast. I feel bad for him being stuck up here with no place to lie down. But I have to say, he is pretty inv  
entive. At one point, his butt was on the seat while the upper part of his body was lying on the floor board. It didn’t look comfortable to me, but apparently he didn’t mind because within a few minutes of finding that position, he was snoring. Who knew dogs could snore so loud?  
  
  We’ve been stopping every couple hours to use the rest room and stretch our legs. We still haven’t made it out of Virginia. To be honest, I’m just glad the roads are clear. You never know what kind of weather you’re going to run into during this time of year. October is one of those tricky months. Some days are beautiful and sunny with fall in the air and other days are freezing and all you want to do is go hibernate for the winter.  
  
  I hate the cold. Maybe after I get settled with my dad, I’ll take a trip to a beach somewhere. The only good thing about winter is being able to wear cute sweaters and boots. But I do miss my dresses during the winter. I wear a dress every day during the summer. I’ve taken sewing classes just so I could make my own summer dresses. There’s nothing like getting up in the morning, taking a shower and slipping on a dress and a cute pair of sandals. There’s no work involved. You can add a cute jacket or extra jewelry but you don’t have to. A dress is simple. During the winter, not only do you have to wear pants and boots but you have to make sure that your shoes go with your top and jacket. Yep, I hate the cold.  
  
  My phone blasting Breathe by Anna Nalick startles me out of my daydream about summer and dresses. Looking at the screen, I see it’s Dad calling.  
  
  “Hi, Daddy. ”  
  
  “Hi, baby girl. Just checking to see how far you got. ”  
  
  Looking at my GPS, I say, “We're still in Virginia and have about six hours left. I’ve been stopping a lot for Beast. ”  
  
  ""Oh, yeah. Forgot you’re bringing that thing you call a dog with you. ” He chuckles under his breath. “I hope you know the only reason I'm letting you bring him into my house is because he saved your life. ”  
  
  I sent him a picture of Beast when I told him he was coming with me. Dad was shocked. He told me that girls were supposed to have little cute dogs for pets, not things that looked like they would eat you.  
  
  “I know, Dad, but he’s a really good dog. ” As if he knows we're talking about him, Beast lifts his head and barks. “I know, sweet boy,” I coo at him.  
  
  ""Yeah, I guess it's not such a bad thing that he can help me scare off all the guys who start sniffing around. ""  
  
  “Ha ha, Dad!”  
  
  ""Well, baby girl, I’ll call you in a few hours to check on you. ""  
  
  “Okay, Dad. Talk to you then. ”  
  
  Hanging up with my dad, I have a smile on my face. I wonder how different my life would be if my mom would have left me with him rather than take me with her. I also wonder why she took me to begin with. My mom met my dad at a graduation party when she was eighteen. They had one night of drunken, unprotected sex and I was born nine months later. Two weeks after that, my mom took off with me to live with her cousin in New York. Growing up, my mom wasn’t involved at all. I had a nanny from as far back as I can remember. Her name was Mrs. B. She lived in the apartment next to us. She was the person I always counted on. If something happened, I would go to her. She would bandage me up or tell me that I shouldn’t cry over boys because they were all stupid. She was the only parental figure I’ve ever really known and when she passed away, I felt like my world crumbled around me. My dad found me not long after Mrs. B’s passing.

  
At first, I was angry and refused to reply to any of the letters he sent. Then one day, I received a huge box stuffed full of cards from birthdays, Christmas, Halloween and every holiday in between. Some looked old and some looked new but they all said the same thing. “Dreaming of when we will spend this day together. ” Since then, we talk every day and he has become one of my best friend’s.  
  
  “Okay, boy, were gonna go take a break. What do you say?” Yes, talking to my dog is now becoming a habit. Most likely, a bad one. I need to make sure that no one is around when I do it or Im going to end up looking like one of the crazy people who think their animal is sending them messages from the other side. That would not be a good thing. I have enough problems without adding insanity into the mix.  
  
  I pull off at the next rest stop and park close to the area designated for dogs. I let Beast out and he shakes his coat and stretches his legs in front of him. We walk over to the grass and I hear another vehicle pull in. I turn around to see if the person getting out has a dog as well. I don’t want to break up a dog fight, and I have no idea how Beast will react to other dogs. I notice that the car that pulled in is still running and no one is getting out.  
  
  The car is a silver Ford Edge with New York plates. The windows are tinted so dark that you can’t see anything inside. Something buzzes across my skin. Beast must feel it too because he starts to growl. Trying to act casually, we start walking back towards my car. I see the back passenger-side door on the Edge open. That’s when I run with Beast running right along beside me. I get my door open and he jumps across my seat.  
  
  Im just able to get the door closed when I see a guy walking in my direction. He’s wearing a black hoodie and black jeans. The hoodie is up so I can’t make out any details of his face, but I know he’s white because his hands are resting on his hips. Without a second look, I put my car in reverse and press the gas pedal. Boxes go sliding as I turn my car to get out of the rest area. I slam the car into drive and start speeding away. I don’t see the Ford Edge in my rearview mirror. My heart is going a million miles a minute and I keep checking for any signs of the Edge. Fortunately, it’s nowhere in sight.  
  
  I start thinking about the whole situation and realize that my imagination is going a little crazy after being attacked. I mean, really, what are the chances that someone from New York would follow me just to try and hurt me again. A few hours later, there’s no sign of the Edge when I check my GPS. I have less than two hours until we get to my dad’s. Looking down at my gas gauge, I see that I have to stop soon to fill up. With that thought, my once calm heart starts to speed up again.  
  
  It’s after seven at night and the interstate is quiet with just a few cars traveling but there are lots of semis on the road. The next exit offers every kind of fast food available so Im hoping there will be a lot of people there. No, not just people. Im hoping for the scary trucker type of people. I exit the interstate and pull into the most well lit gas station around. There are a few other cars getting gas so I get out and go inside to pay. There is a Dunkin’ Donuts and, like a parched man in a desert, I find myself standing in front of their counter. After getting my coffee, paying for gas, and getting another bottle of water for Beast, I step out into the parking lot. Looking around, I walk quickly to my car.  
  
  “That’s a beautiful dog you have there. ”  
  
  Screaming and stepping back, I almost fall over the hose that is going from the pump into my car. “Sorry I scared you, honey. I just saw your dog and he’s a beaute. ”  
  
  “Oh, thanks,” I say while holding my chest. Getting a look at the guy, he looks harmless. He’s dressed a lot like Santa Claus, including the suspenders with a red and black plaid shirt tucked into his jeans and black boots. I can’t help the smile that comes to my face. He smiles back.  
  
  “Russ,” he says, sticking out his hand.  
  
  “November,” I say, shaking his back.  
  
  “What kind of dog is he?”  
  
  “Great Dane, I think. Im not sure. I only looked up pictures online after I found him. His name is Beast. ”  
  
  “You found him and named him Beast,” he laughs.  
  
  “Well, actually, it’s a long story but I guess he kind of found me. ”  
  
  “That I believe!” he says with a sad look on his face. “You take care of him and he’ll take care of you, honey. I used to have a dog like that and he traveled everywhere with me. Even took my back a couple times when I got into a jam. They really are man’s best friend. ” He looks so lost talking about his dog that I wanted to say something but didn’t know what. I reach my hand out and squeeze his. He squeezes mine back then I drop mine to my side and gave him a small smile.  
  
  “Welp, gotta hit the road. Have a load to drop off in Nashville. You drive safe. ”  
  
  “You too,” I say as he walks to a semi with the word yellow written on the back and climbs inside. Then, without thinking, I lift my fist up in the air and pull down. With that, he blows his horn and is on his way. I can’t help the smile that hits my face.  
  
  My GPS announces that we have reached our destination as Im driving up a long private road. In the distance, I see large blue house with a white wraparound porch. Sitting in the dark in a rocking chair is my dad. I slow down to take him in. He has his bare feet stretched out in front of him with a cup in his left hand. He’s wearing jeans with a V-neck blue long sleeve T-shirt. His dark hair barely touches the collar of his shirt and is pushed back from his face. His skin looks tan, like he spends a lot of time out in the sun, but around his eyes is lighter. He probably wears sunglasses when he’s out enjoying the sun.  
  
  I pull up as he stands and starts down the stairs. I try to open my door but he’s already there, pulling my door open. Getting out of the car, my hands start to shake and all of the stress and worry from the last few days comes to the surface. I know that now that Im here, my dad will take care of everything. He is my biggest supporter and the person I can always count on to have my back. He pulls me into a giant hug, shaking me around. When he finally sets me in front of him, he looks down at me and his hands go to my face.  
  
  “You look more beautiful than the last time I saw you, baby girl. Even with all the bruises,” he says, holding my face gently in his hands. His face changes and his jaw gets tight. “If I ever see the fucking guy who did this to you, he’s going to wish he was never born. I hope they catch that fucking coward,” he says, letting go of my face and hugging me into his chest while kissing the top of my head. “Welcome home, baby girl. ”  
  
  That was all I needed to hear for my whole body to relax into his. Welcome home. I actually had a home and it felt beautiful. “It feels good to be home,” I say with a smile. Just then, Beast pushes his way between us. Dad bends down to show him some love. He scratches his head and, in return, Beast licks his face. “Hey, now. None of that,” he says while standing. “So, baby girl, are you ready to see your new place and get a lay of the land or do you want to just see your room and pass out?”  
  
  Laughing, I say, “I’ll just see the room and pass out. It was a long drive. ”  
  
  “I know that you wanted to get here quickly but you should have stayed another night in a hotel. ”  
  
  I didn’t tell my dad about the rest stop because I didn’t want him to worry. And I think I was just being paranoid. But after that happened, all I wanted was to get to my dad’s house and put as many miles as I could between me and New York.  
  
  “I know, Dad, but I just wanted to get here. ”  
  
  “Im glad you made it here safely. Let’s get you inside so you can get settled and get some sleep. "" He puts his arm around my shoulder, taking me with him.  
  
  Walking into the house, I was a surprised that everything looked like it was out of a magazine. By the front door was a long, black table with a bowl filled with keys and coins. The wood floors were so dark, they almost looked black. Walking down the hallway, we enter a room with the tallest ceilings I’ve ever seen. The beams going acro  
ss the room were the same color as the wood floors. There was a wall of windows from one side of the room to the other. The kitchen was open to the living room with an island in the center that was as big as a dining table with five stools in front of it. The appliances in the kitchen all looked new and unused. The countertops are a light granite with brown and red streaming through them. In living room, theres a leather couch that looks more like a bed with a low back. The entertainment center is built into the wall and two leather recliners sit on either side of the low couch. The throw pillows and blankets on the back of the couch match the granite in the kitchen. All the colors in the room blend perfectly together. I see caramel, dark brown, and red everywhere I turn.  
  
  “Wow, Dad, this is beautiful. ”  
  
  “Thanks, baby. Your grandmother decorated it. ""  
  
  “Grandmother?” I ask.  
  
  ""Yeah. She cant wait to meet you. I know we havent talked about my family much but they all know about you and are excited to get to know you. ""  
  
  “Awesome,” I whisper, still in shock that my mom took me when I a baby. She never talked about my dad at all. I never even knew who he was until I turned eighteen and he tracked me down. Every time he has come to New York to visit, he never talked about his family and I never asked. I figured his story was the same as my mom’s. Her parents died before I could meet them and she didnt have any brothers or sisters. My mom has always been a loner, unless you have something she wants. Then, she will attach herself to you like a life-sucking parasite.  
  
  ""Everyone will be here for breakfast. They wanted to come tonight but I thought you might get overwhelmed on your first night home. Also, we need to talk about you doing the books for the club. Your degree will help me get the office straightened out. I don’t have a lot of time to manage that part of the business. Lynn moved away with her husband and I haven’t had a chance to replace her. ”  
  
  “When do I start?” I say, smiling.  
  
  “Well, tonight I want you to rest. ” He squeezes my shoulder. “And for the rest of the week, I want you to recover. After you’re feeling up to it, I’ll take you down to the club and show you the office. Hopefully, you can set something up so you can work from home. ”  
  
  “Sounds good to me. ” Walking through the kitchen, there’s a set of stairs going down to the basement. “Wow, Dad, I thought you loved me and now you’re taking me to the dungeon. ”  
  
  Laughing, he shakes his head. “No. There’s a basement apartment. Your grandma and everyone else came over and worked on it all day yesterday. They rushed over as soon as they found out you’d be staying with me. It also has its own entrance so you can have some privacy. ” He flips on the light.  
  
  “Its perfect. ” There’s a small living room and kitchen when you first walk in. He leads me down a short hall and opens a door. The bedroom is huge and there’s also an attached bathroom with a stand-up shower and a pedestal sink. I’m so overwhelmed that I start crying.  
  
  “It’s okay,” Dad says while dragging me into his body for a hug. “We just want you to be happy here.
