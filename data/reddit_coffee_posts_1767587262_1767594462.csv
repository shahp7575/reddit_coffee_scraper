1q4eae5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BangaloreMeetups/comments/1q4eae5/hi_bangalore_we_are_new_here/,Hi Bangalore 👋 We are new here!,"Hey everyone 👋

I work with a small team building an app called **Belong**, and we’ve just launched in Bangalore. The whole idea is to make it easier to meet people and feel part of a community here.

On Belong, you can easily:

* **Join or create local events** (coffee meetups, hikes, book clubs, or add existing events so users can join in)
* **Monetize your skills** if you want to host something (like teaching yoga or a skill workshop).

Most profiles are verified, so you know you’re talking to real people.

Belong is already used by over a million people worldwide, with thousands of meetups happening every week, and we’re excited to start building that same energy in Bangalore 🌆

You can check out the app from the link in the comments, or find us on Instagram: [https://www.instagram.com/belong.app](https://www.instagram.com/belong.app)

No pressure at all, just wanted to introduce Belong to this community.

If you do check it out, I’d love to hear your thoughts 🙌",1,1767594379.0,BangaloreMeetups,1,1.0,False

1q4ea19,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1q4ea19/vegas_trip_report_kids_shows_area_15_and_luxor_in/,"Vegas Trip Report - Kids, Shows, Area 15, and Luxor in Jan","I admit it, we are the Vegas tourists that may be ruining Vegas. We do food and shows but don't gamble much, and we brought kids. I don't come often, maybe once every 2-3 years. 3 nights Jan 1-4. We are in our 50's, kids 9 and 15.

We stayed at the Luxor (comprised of $125 room, $50 resort fee per night), I've never stayed there and have wanted to stay in the pyramid since it opened when I was in high school, so finally, bucket list item checked off. Yes, the pyramid rooms are a bit down on their luck, and our room had NOTHING (no coffee machine, no fridge, not even a minibar to my surprise, not even a pen, okay it had wifi and a TV) but it had nice views inside and out, killer water pressure, was quiet, and we had good nights' sleep. Also, when you stay in a place like the Luxor, at least the bottled water at the store is going to be $6 not $12. It was fine. Pool was closed, no hot tub, but fitness center was small but quite nice. Weights, kettle balls, machines, treadmills, cycles, ellipticals, yoga mat, foam roller, water machine, clean, next to the spa so spa-level cleanliness. At $50 resort fee it better be.

We saw Blue Man Group ($95pp, back quarter of a small theater), O ($250pp, center, first 8 rows), and Penn and Teller ($150pp, first 6 rows). All costs include taxes and fees. This was basically me showing my kids some of my favorite shows of my past and also finally catching P&T for the first time. I thought P&T was for older kids but dang people brought their little kids which was fine but not sure they knew what was going on. I only brought the teenager. BMG, people kept walking into the show or from one seat to another throughout the performance, which was annoying as hell, I guess I should've gotten seats closer to the stage so I didn't have to see endless people walking in front of me but really thought in a small theater I didn't have to pay to be up that close.

Bellagio (for O) was a madhouse. Could barely walk around it. Saw one fountain show (audio too quiet) and split. Also, getting there was terrible because you have to enter from the Strip instead of some nice back alley like for Luxor's Self Parking (at least the back alleys for Bellagio were not on our Google Maps in, we did use them on our way out and I swear it told us to drive down some pavement with arrows pointing the opposite way so not sure what we drove was legal...). I nearly had a breakdown thinking I was going to miss the show while trying to get there from Luxor having given myself 40 minutes to get there. I'm sure there's a Bellagio access hack out there but too late.

Spring Mountain Road is our dining place of choice and we went there 1-2 times a day. I decided to choose one shopping plaza (Seoul Plaza) and hit almost every restaurant in there, ranging from a fancy omakase sushi place (Kabuto, $300pp inc tip) to some great curry (Zen, $30pp, appetizers, drinks, tip). Good bang for buck compared to Strip, IMHO. 

This meant renting a car ($80/day, I originally posted on this reddit asking if renting a car was necessary). And, in the end, it just added so much flexibility. There was rainy weather during our long weekend and having the car meant we could choose the day and time to go out to Red Rocks (don't forget to reserve your vehicle entry and buy national parks access). Probably not useful in the summer, but it was also just a quiet place to sit and wait if all four people didn't want to do the same things. Staying at Luxor meant we could park under the same parking fee ($20) at all the other MGM properties for 24 hours (ex. Bellagio). 

We were ready to lose $300 over this long weekend but actually only lost $50! Luxor has a $5 blackjack table but it mainly has beginners. Still, a good place to get your legs back.

Hit Area 15. Actually just wanted to visit Omega Mart but in the end did Pass 3A ($150pp) and did not regret it, esp since we had kids. Having 2 days made it less stressful in trying to hit all the things on the pass since there could be lines for things. Saturday was a madhouse, lines, crowds, but Sunday much calmer. John Wick Experience was pretty cool (and we've only seen the first movie), Illuminarium chill, VR games family-friendly, Omega as expected (and we had high expectations). Lots of psychedelic stuff and loud electronic music. Like taking your kids to Burning Man but without the dust and RVs and weird adults.

So that's our trip report with kids, almost no gambling, eating off Strip, and splurging on shows and Area 15.",1,1767594348.0,vegas,0,1.0,False

1q4e8i4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q4e8i4,Help us with our living room!,"My partner and I are trying to redesign our living room. 

We have an open plan living and dining area that we don't really know how to furnish. I've just moved the brown couch pictured back onto the wall. Previously it was facing the black and green couch on the edge of the blue carpet, and we didn't have the red carpet. This left a lot of dead space behind which wasn't really being used. I like having the couches on opposite walls as it leaves a huge amount of usable floor space for things like yoga, playing with dog, just sitting on the floor, etc. But my partner thinks that it looks weird having the couches so far apart, and isn't a good vibe for socializing. 

I would love some ideas for how we could overhaul the space to maximize open floor space, but also have a nice space for hanging out / entertaining guests. We don't have a TV and aren't really considering getting one at the moment, but it is an option. 

Idea 1: Get a new L shaped couch on the left side wall, place a coffee table in front of it, and have a couple of armchairs facing the couch (one opposite facing, one on the side). This would be a nice conversation / hang out space. On the far right wall I would have a sideboard with books/plants/storage, and have a large carpet covering the whole area. 

Idea 2: Have a TV on the right hand wall, with a large couch facing the TV, and an armchair beside the couch facing towards the backyard). Keep a large open space behind the couch with a separate carpet there for activities.

The Brain Song is an innovative program that’s all about brain support, created by some smart neuroscientists and engineers.  
  
It’s just a 7-minute audio track that uses sound frequencies to help improve brain health and focus.  
  
Sounds neat, right?  
  
After looking into how it works, checking out customer experiences, and diving into the science behind it, I’ve got to say it definitely brings something fresh to the brain wellness scene.  
  
**What Is The Brain Song?**  
  
Okay, so tell see what is The Brain Song?  
  
The Brain Song is a quick audio track that claims to use brainwave entrainment to help you with memory, focus, and mood.  
  
It says it’ll help clear brain fog, reduce stress, and boost creativity all in just a few minutes of listening each day.  
  
While the idea sounds pretty cool, there are some questions about how it works. Unlike well-known methods like making some lifestyle changes, doing brain exercises, or taking nootropic supplements that have solid clinical backing, this program mostly hinges on the belief that sound waves can affect brain activity.  
  
There’s not a lot of independent research out there to really back it up, so it’s natural to feel a bit skeptical.  
  
**About The Creator of The Brain Song**  
  
okay, so now lets talk about its creator….  
  
The Brain Song was build by together by Dr. James Rivers and his crew over at Binaural Technologies.  
  
Dr. James Rivers, a neuroscientist trained by NASA, had a huge moment when he came across a Harvard study showing that 90-year-olds were better at memory and focus than 20-year-olds.  
  
he was curious about why some people stay sharp in their minds as they age while others have a hard time, he jumped into research that looked at 3,300 studies. What he found really changed the way we think about aging and the brain.  
  
From what he discovered, he created The Brain Song — a 7-minute audio program that uses soundwave tech to kickstart BDNF, which is the important protein for memory, focus, and keeping your brain healthy.  
  
**How to Use The Brain Song?**  
  
Using The Brain Song is super simple and really effective. Just follow these steps to tap into your brain’s full potential:  
  
Step 1: Find a Quiet Spot: Look for a calm place where you can sit or lie down without distractions. It’s a good idea to use headphones or earbuds for the best sound experience.  
  
Step 2: Pick Your Track: The Brain Song audio is in .m4a format and helps boost different mental states like clarity, focus, creativity, and relaxation. Choose the track that fits what you want to achieve today.  
  
Step 3: Listen Daily (10–15 Minutes): Tune in to the audio once a day, ideally in the morning or during a break when your brain is most awake. Doing this regularly gives you the best results.  
  
Step 4: Let It Flow: Don’t worry about trying to force your focus. Just relax, take some deep breaths, and let the sounds work their magic on your brain. Many people start feeling the benefits after just a few listens.  
  
  
  
Optional: Grab the PDF Guide: When you download, you’ll also get a PDF guide that explains how the audio works, the science behind it, and tips for getting the most out of it. Take a few minutes to check it out for a clearer understanding.

**How Does The Brain Song Work?**  
  
The Brain Song takes advantage of cool audio tech to boost your brainpower with sound.  
  
It features a bunch of specially made audio tracks that mix binaural beats, isochronic tones, and rhythmic sounds to tune into your brain’s frequencies.  
  
When you listen — especially with headphones — your brain starts syncing up with these sounds in a process called brainwave entrainment.  
  
Each track is made to bring out a specific mental state…..  
  
Alpha waves help you chill out and boost creativity. Beta waves keep you focused and alert. Theta waves get you deeply relaxed and let you tap into your subconscious.  
  
The Brain Song helps you sharpen your focus, clear your mind, boost your memory, and stabilize your emotions — all without using stimulants or any hard work.  
  
You’ll also get a PDF guide that shows you the best times and ways to use each track to see the best effects.  
  
It’s a safe and gentle way to unlock your brain’s full potential — great for anyone wanting to up their productivity, clear their thoughts, and relieve stress in just a few minutes each day….

Original User review : 

(Mark, 42, software dev here.) I’ve been lurking here for a while, watching the endless debates about nootropics and brain apps. I know the hype around ""The Brain Song"" is huge—you hear claims that **""It's safe, effective, and based on real science."" But (here comes the kicker), there are plenty of Brain Song enthusiasts out there messing up the message with unbelievable promises.** I was one of the biggest skeptics. An audio file that boosts my brain? It sounded like pure pseudoscience and snake oil, but the promise of improved focus finally wore me down. I had to know: **Does this thing actually work?**

My biggest pain point has always been the 3 PM slump. I work a demanding job that requires sharp memory recall and sustained focus, and lately, the mental fatigue has been brutal. I tried all the usual fixes: more caffeine (which gave me the jitters), meditation (which I wasn't consistent with), and expensive supplements (which did nothing but make my wallet lighter).

When I stumbled across The Brain Song, I saw two things that made me pause my scroll:

1. **The time commitment:** Just 12 minutes a day. That's less than my coffee break.
2. **The price structure:** **One-time payment.** No recurring $50/month subscription BS.

I decided to treat it as a low-risk experiment. If it didn't work, I was only out a little cash, and they offered a decent guarantee.

# What actually is The Brain Song?

So, let's break down the tech behind the hype and the controversy. The audio program is based on the scientific principle of brainwave entrainment, which uses specific sound frequencies to influence brain states like focus and relaxation. It's a neuro-acoustic program that uses precise frequencies to gently guide your brain's electrical activity toward a Gamma wave state—linked to peak concentration and BDNF stimulation.

The catch? Brain Song's effectiveness is debated, with some users reporting significant improvements in memory and focus, while others report little to no change. However, individual results vary based on factors like overall health, consistency of use, and personal expectations, with some users noting disappointment if they expected an interactive program rather than a simple audio file. Essentially, you are passively 'listening' your way to better mental performance, but your personal experience will define the outcome.

# Does The Brain Song Actually Work?

When I first listened to it, I almost laughed. It’s not music; it’s a weird, pulsing, whooshing soundscape, often described as *brainwave entrainment* audio. It’s supposed to be guiding your brain into that Gamma wave state associated with deep learning and sharp focus.

Compared to nootropic supplements and brain-training apps, The Brain Song offers a non-invasive, time-efficient alternative that many users find effective—although results vary.

* **Week 1: Nothing.** Honestly, I just felt a little annoyed by the sound and kept checking the clock. The biggest benefit was just having 12 forced minutes of quiet time. I almost gave up.
* **Week 2: The Subtle Shift.** This is where I started noticing something. It wasn't a sudden burst of genius, but the afternoon slump wasn't as severe. Instead of hitting a wall at 3 PM, I felt a smoother decline in energy. My mental recall felt *less effortful*—I was pulling up names and facts just a tiny bit quicker.
* **Week 3 & 4: Consistency Pays Off.** I committed to listening first thing in the morning with good quality over-the-ear headphones. The biggest benefit for me now (30 days in) is **clarity and flow**. I still get distracted, but I snap back into focus faster. The ""fog"" is noticeably thinner. I feel like the *maximum* level of clarity I can achieve during the workday has been elevated.

**Verdict on Effectiveness:** Is it magic? No. Is it a replacement for good sleep and diet? Absolutely not. But as a daily, passive tool, I am genuinely impressed with the subtle cognitive boost. I’d estimate about 70-80% of the positive reviews I've read about improved focus and recall are aligned with my personal experience, *provided you use it every single day.*",1,1767594001.0,pppdizziness,0,1.0,False

So, let's break down the tech behind the hype and the controversy. The audio program is based on the scientific principle of brainwave entrainment, which uses specific sound frequencies to influence brain states like focus and relaxation. It's a neuro-acoustic program that uses precise frequencies to gently guide your brain's electrical activity toward a Gamma wave state—linked to peak concentration and BDNF stimulation.

The catch? Brain Song's effectiveness is debated, with some users reporting significant improvements in memory and focus, while others report little to no change. However, individual results vary based on factors like overall health, consistency of use, and personal expectations, with some users noting disappointment if they expected an interactive program rather than a simple audio file. Essentially, you are passively 'listening' your way to better mental performance, but your personal experience will define the outcome.

# Does The Brain Song Actually Work?

When I first listened to it, I almost laughed. It’s not music; it’s a weird, pulsing, whooshing soundscape, often described as *brainwave entrainment* audio. It’s supposed to be guiding your brain into that Gamma wave state associated with deep learning and sharp focus.

Compared to nootropic supplements and brain-training apps, The Brain Song offers a non-invasive, time-efficient alternative that many users find effective—although results vary.

* **Week 1: Nothing.** Honestly, I just felt a little annoyed by the sound and kept checking the clock. The biggest benefit was just having 12 forced minutes of quiet time. I almost gave up.
* **Week 2: The Subtle Shift.** This is where I started noticing something. It wasn't a sudden burst of genius, but the afternoon slump wasn't as severe. Instead of hitting a wall at 3 PM, I felt a smoother decline in energy. My mental recall felt *less effortful*—I was pulling up names and facts just a tiny bit quicker.
* **Week 3 & 4: Consistency Pays Off.** I committed to listening first thing in the morning with good quality over-the-ear headphones. The biggest benefit for me now (30 days in) is **clarity and flow**. I still get distracted, but I snap back into focus faster. The ""fog"" is noticeably thinner. I feel like the *maximum* level of clarity I can achieve during the workday has been elevated.

**Verdict on Effectiveness:** Is it magic? No. Is it a replacement for good sleep and diet? Absolutely not. But as a daily, passive tool, I am genuinely impressed with the subtle cognitive boost. I’d estimate about 70-80% of the positive reviews I've read about improved focus and recall are aligned with my personal experience, *provided you use it every single day.*

The Brain Song is an innovative program that’s all about brain support, created by some smart neuroscientists and engineers.  
  
It’s just a 7-minute audio track that uses sound frequencies to help improve brain health and focus.  
  
Sounds neat, right?  
  
After looking into how it works, checking out customer experiences, and diving into the science behind it, I’ve got to say it definitely brings something fresh to the brain wellness scene.  
  
**What Is The Brain Song?**  
  
Okay, so tell see what is The Brain Song?  
  
The Brain Song is a quick audio track that claims to use brainwave entrainment to help you with memory, focus, and mood.  
  
It says it’ll help clear brain fog, reduce stress, and boost creativity all in just a few minutes of listening each day.  
  
While the idea sounds pretty cool, there are some questions about how it works. Unlike well-known methods like making some lifestyle changes, doing brain exercises, or taking nootropic supplements that have solid clinical backing, this program mostly hinges on the belief that sound waves can affect brain activity.  
  
There’s not a lot of independent research out there to really back it up, so it’s natural to feel a bit skeptical.  
  
**About The Creator of The Brain Song**  
  
okay, so now lets talk about its creator….  
  
The Brain Song was build by together by Dr. James Rivers and his crew over at Binaural Technologies.  
  
Dr. James Rivers, a neuroscientist trained by NASA, had a huge moment when he came across a Harvard study showing that 90-year-olds were better at memory and focus than 20-year-olds.  
  
he was curious about why some people stay sharp in their minds as they age while others have a hard time, he jumped into research that looked at 3,300 studies. What he found really changed the way we think about aging and the brain.  
  
From what he discovered, he created The Brain Song — a 7-minute audio program that uses soundwave tech to kickstart BDNF, which is the important protein for memory, focus, and keeping your brain healthy.  
  
**How to Use The Brain Song?**  
  
Using The Brain Song is super simple and really effective. Just follow these steps to tap into your brain’s full potential:  
  
Step 1: Find a Quiet Spot: Look for a calm place where you can sit or lie down without distractions. It’s a good idea to use headphones or earbuds for the best sound experience.  
  
Step 2: Pick Your Track: The Brain Song audio is in .m4a format and helps boost different mental states like clarity, focus, creativity, and relaxation. Choose the track that fits what you want to achieve today.  
  
Step 3: Listen Daily (10–15 Minutes): Tune in to the audio once a day, ideally in the morning or during a break when your brain is most awake. Doing this regularly gives you the best results.  
  
Step 4: Let It Flow: Don’t worry about trying to force your focus. Just relax, take some deep breaths, and let the sounds work their magic on your brain. Many people start feeling the benefits after just a few listens.  
  
  
  
Optional: Grab the PDF Guide: When you download, you’ll also get a PDF guide that explains how the audio works, the science behind it, and tips for getting the most out of it. Take a few minutes to check it out for a clearer understanding.

**How Does The Brain Song Work?**  
  
The Brain Song takes advantage of cool audio tech to boost your brainpower with sound.  
  
It features a bunch of specially made audio tracks that mix binaural beats, isochronic tones, and rhythmic sounds to tune into your brain’s frequencies.  
  
When you listen — especially with headphones — your brain starts syncing up with these sounds in a process called brainwave entrainment.  
  
Each track is made to bring out a specific mental state…..  
  
Alpha waves help you chill out and boost creativity. Beta waves keep you focused and alert. Theta waves get you deeply relaxed and let you tap into your subconscious.  
  
The Brain Song helps you sharpen your focus, clear your mind, boost your memory, and stabilize your emotions — all without using stimulants or any hard work.  
  
You’ll also get a PDF guide that shows you the best times and ways to use each track to see the best effects.  
  
It’s a safe and gentle way to unlock your brain’s full potential — great for anyone wanting to up their productivity, clear their thoughts, and relieve stress in just a few minutes each day….

Original User review : 

(Mark, 42, software dev here.) I’ve been lurking here for a while, watching the endless debates about nootropics and brain apps. I know the hype around ""The Brain Song"" is huge—you hear claims that **""It's safe, effective, and based on real science."" But (here comes the kicker), there are plenty of Brain Song enthusiasts out there messing up the message with unbelievable promises.** I was one of the biggest skeptics. An audio file that boosts my brain? It sounded like pure pseudoscience and snake oil, but the promise of improved focus finally wore me down. I had to know: **Does this thing actually work?**

My biggest pain point has always been the 3 PM slump. I work a demanding job that requires sharp memory recall and sustained focus, and lately, the mental fatigue has been brutal. I tried all the usual fixes: more caffeine (which gave me the jitters), meditation (which I wasn't consistent with), and expensive supplements (which did nothing but make my wallet lighter).

When I stumbled across The Brain Song, I saw two things that made me pause my scroll:

1. **The time commitment:** Just 12 minutes a day. That's less than my coffee break.
2. **The price structure:** **One-time payment.** No recurring $50/month subscription BS.

The Brain Song is an innovative program that’s all about brain support, created by some smart neuroscientists and engineers.  
  
It’s just a 7-minute audio track that uses sound frequencies to help improve brain health and focus.  
  
Sounds neat, right?  
  
After looking into how it works, checking out customer experiences, and diving into the science behind it, I’ve got to say it definitely brings something fresh to the brain wellness scene.  
  
**What Is The Brain Song?**  
  
Okay, so tell see what is The Brain Song?  
  
The Brain Song is a quick audio track that claims to use brainwave entrainment to help you with memory, focus, and mood.  
  
It says it’ll help clear brain fog, reduce stress, and boost creativity all in just a few minutes of listening each day.  
  
While the idea sounds pretty cool, there are some questions about how it works. Unlike well-known methods like making some lifestyle changes, doing brain exercises, or taking nootropic supplements that have solid clinical backing, this program mostly hinges on the belief that sound waves can affect brain activity.  
  
There’s not a lot of independent research out there to really back it up, so it’s natural to feel a bit skeptical.  
  
**About The Creator of The Brain Song**  
  
okay, so now lets talk about its creator….  
  
The Brain Song was build by together by Dr. James Rivers and his crew over at Binaural Technologies.  
  
Dr. James Rivers, a neuroscientist trained by NASA, had a huge moment when he came across a Harvard study showing that 90-year-olds were better at memory and focus than 20-year-olds.  
  
he was curious about why some people stay sharp in their minds as they age while others have a hard time, he jumped into research that looked at 3,300 studies. What he found really changed the way we think about aging and the brain.  
  
From what he discovered, he created The Brain Song — a 7-minute audio program that uses soundwave tech to kickstart BDNF, which is the important protein for memory, focus, and keeping your brain healthy.  
  
**How to Use The Brain Song?**  
  
Using The Brain Song is super simple and really effective. Just follow these steps to tap into your brain’s full potential:  
  
Step 1: Find a Quiet Spot: Look for a calm place where you can sit or lie down without distractions. It’s a good idea to use headphones or earbuds for the best sound experience.  
  
Step 2: Pick Your Track: The Brain Song audio is in .m4a format and helps boost different mental states like clarity, focus, creativity, and relaxation. Choose the track that fits what you want to achieve today.  
  
Step 3: Listen Daily (10–15 Minutes): Tune in to the audio once a day, ideally in the morning or during a break when your brain is most awake. Doing this regularly gives you the best results.  
  
Step 4: Let It Flow: Don’t worry about trying to force your focus. Just relax, take some deep breaths, and let the sounds work their magic on your brain. Many people start feeling the benefits after just a few listens.  
  
  
  
Optional: Grab the PDF Guide: When you download, you’ll also get a PDF guide that explains how the audio works, the science behind it, and tips for getting the most out of it. Take a few minutes to check it out for a clearer understanding.

**How Does The Brain Song Work?**  
  
The Brain Song takes advantage of cool audio tech to boost your brainpower with sound.  
  
It features a bunch of specially made audio tracks that mix binaural beats, isochronic tones, and rhythmic sounds to tune into your brain’s frequencies.  
  
When you listen — especially with headphones — your brain starts syncing up with these sounds in a process called brainwave entrainment.  
  
Each track is made to bring out a specific mental state…..  
  
Alpha waves help you chill out and boost creativity. Beta waves keep you focused and alert. Theta waves get you deeply relaxed and let you tap into your subconscious.  
  
The Brain Song helps you sharpen your focus, clear your mind, boost your memory, and stabilize your emotions — all without using stimulants or any hard work.  
  
You’ll also get a PDF guide that shows you the best times and ways to use each track to see the best effects.  
  
It’s a safe and gentle way to unlock your brain’s full potential — great for anyone wanting to up their productivity, clear their thoughts, and relieve stress in just a few minutes each day….

Original User review : 

(Mark, 42, software dev here.) I’ve been lurking here for a while, watching the endless debates about nootropics and brain apps. I know the hype around ""The Brain Song"" is huge—you hear claims that **""It's safe, effective, and based on real science."" But (here comes the kicker), there are plenty of Brain Song enthusiasts out there messing up the message with unbelievable promises.** I was one of the biggest skeptics. An audio file that boosts my brain? It sounded like pure pseudoscience and snake oil, but the promise of improved focus finally wore me down. I had to know: **Does this thing actually work?**

My biggest pain point has always been the 3 PM slump. I work a demanding job that requires sharp memory recall and sustained focus, and lately, the mental fatigue has been brutal. I tried all the usual fixes: more caffeine (which gave me the jitters), meditation (which I wasn't consistent with), and expensive supplements (which did nothing but make my wallet lighter).

When I stumbled across The Brain Song, I saw two things that made me pause my scroll:

1. **The time commitment:** Just 12 minutes a day. That's less than my coffee break.
2. **The price structure:** **One-time payment.** No recurring $50/month subscription BS.

I decided to treat it as a low-risk experiment. If it didn't work, I was only out a little cash, and they offered a decent guarantee.

# What actually is The Brain Song?

So, let's break down the tech behind the hype and the controversy. The audio program is based on the scientific principle of brainwave entrainment, which uses specific sound frequencies to influence brain states like focus and relaxation. It's a neuro-acoustic program that uses precise frequencies to gently guide your brain's electrical activity toward a Gamma wave state—linked to peak concentration and BDNF stimulation.

The catch? Brain Song's effectiveness is debated, with some users reporting significant improvements in memory and focus, while others report little to no change. However, individual results vary based on factors like overall health, consistency of use, and personal expectations, with some users noting disappointment if they expected an interactive program rather than a simple audio file. Essentially, you are passively 'listening' your way to better mental performance, but your personal experience will define the outcome.

# Does The Brain Song Actually Work?

When I first listened to it, I almost laughed. It’s not music; it’s a weird, pulsing, whooshing soundscape, often described as *brainwave entrainment* audio. It’s supposed to be guiding your brain into that Gamma wave state associated with deep learning and sharp focus.

Compared to nootropic supplements and brain-training apps, The Brain Song offers a non-invasive, time-efficient alternative that many users find effective—although results vary.

* **Week 1: Nothing.** Honestly, I just felt a little annoyed by the sound and kept checking the clock. The biggest benefit was just having 12 forced minutes of quiet time. I almost gave up.
* **Week 2: The Subtle Shift.** This is where I started noticing something. It wasn't a sudden burst of genius, but the afternoon slump wasn't as severe. Instead of hitting a wall at 3 PM, I felt a smoother decline in energy. My mental recall felt *less effortful*—I was pulling up names and facts just a tiny bit quicker.
* **Week 3 & 4: Consistency Pays Off.** I committed to listening first thing in the morning with good quality over-the-ear headphones.

The Brain Song is an innovative program that’s all about brain support, created by some smart neuroscientists and engineers.  
  
It’s just a 7-minute audio track that uses sound frequencies to help improve brain health and focus.  
  
Sounds neat, right?  
  
After looking into how it works, checking out customer experiences, and diving into the science behind it, I’ve got to say it definitely brings something fresh to the brain wellness scene.  
  
**What Is The Brain Song?**  
  
Okay, so tell see what is The Brain Song?  
  
The Brain Song is a quick audio track that claims to use brainwave entrainment to help you with memory, focus, and mood.  
  
It says it’ll help clear brain fog, reduce stress, and boost creativity all in just a few minutes of listening each day.  
  
While the idea sounds pretty cool, there are some questions about how it works. Unlike well-known methods like making some lifestyle changes, doing brain exercises, or taking nootropic supplements that have solid clinical backing, this program mostly hinges on the belief that sound waves can affect brain activity.  
  
There’s not a lot of independent research out there to really back it up, so it’s natural to feel a bit skeptical.  
  
**About The Creator of The Brain Song**  
  
okay, so now lets talk about its creator….  
  
The Brain Song was build by together by Dr. James Rivers and his crew over at Binaural Technologies.  
  
Dr. James Rivers, a neuroscientist trained by NASA, had a huge moment when he came across a Harvard study showing that 90-year-olds were better at memory and focus than 20-year-olds.  
  
he was curious about why some people stay sharp in their minds as they age while others have a hard time, he jumped into research that looked at 3,300 studies. What he found really changed the way we think about aging and the brain.  
  
From what he discovered, he created The Brain Song — a 7-minute audio program that uses soundwave tech to kickstart BDNF, which is the important protein for memory, focus, and keeping your brain healthy.  
  
**How to Use The Brain Song?**  
  
Using The Brain Song is super simple and really effective. Just follow these steps to tap into your brain’s full potential:  
  
Step 1: Find a Quiet Spot: Look for a calm place where you can sit or lie down without distractions. It’s a good idea to use headphones or earbuds for the best sound experience.  
  
Step 2: Pick Your Track: The Brain Song audio is in .m4a format and helps boost different mental states like clarity, focus, creativity, and relaxation. Choose the track that fits what you want to achieve today.  
  
Step 3: Listen Daily (10–15 Minutes): Tune in to the audio once a day, ideally in the morning or during a break when your brain is most awake. Doing this regularly gives you the best results.  
  
Step 4: Let It Flow: Don’t worry about trying to force your focus. Just relax, take some deep breaths, and let the sounds work their magic on your brain. Many people start feeling the benefits after just a few listens.  
  
  
  
Optional: Grab the PDF Guide: When you download, you’ll also get a PDF guide that explains how the audio works, the science behind it, and tips for getting the most out of it. Take a few minutes to check it out for a clearer understanding.

**How Does The Brain Song Work?**  
  
The Brain Song takes advantage of cool audio tech to boost your brainpower with sound.  
  
It features a bunch of specially made audio tracks that mix binaural beats, isochronic tones, and rhythmic sounds to tune into your brain’s frequencies.  
  
When you listen — especially with headphones — your brain starts syncing up with these sounds in a process called brainwave entrainment.  
  
Each track is made to bring out a specific mental state…..  
  
Alpha waves help you chill out and boost creativity. Beta waves keep you focused and alert. Theta waves get you deeply relaxed and let you tap into your subconscious.  
  
The Brain Song helps you sharpen your focus, clear your mind, boost your memory, and stabilize your emotions — all without using stimulants or any hard work.  
  
You’ll also get a PDF guide that shows you the best times and ways to use each track to see the best effects.  
  
It’s a safe and gentle way to unlock your brain’s full potential — great for anyone wanting to up their productivity, clear their thoughts, and relieve stress in just a few minutes each day….

Original User review : 

(Mark, 42, software dev here.) I’ve been lurking here for a while, watching the endless debates about nootropics and brain apps. I know the hype around ""The Brain Song"" is huge—you hear claims that **""It's safe, effective, and based on real science."" But (here comes the kicker), there are plenty of Brain Song enthusiasts out there messing up the message with unbelievable promises.** I was one of the biggest skeptics. An audio file that boosts my brain? It sounded like pure pseudoscience and snake oil, but the promise of improved focus finally wore me down. I had to know: **Does this thing actually work?**

My biggest pain point has always been the 3 PM slump. I work a demanding job that requires sharp memory recall and sustained focus, and lately, the mental fatigue has been brutal. I tried all the usual fixes: more caffeine (which gave me the jitters), meditation (which I wasn't consistent with), and expensive supplements (which did nothing but make my wallet lighter).

When I stumbled across The Brain Song, I saw two things that made me pause my scroll:

1. **The time commitment:** Just 12 minutes a day. That's less than my coffee break.
2. **The price structure:** **One-time payment.** No recurring $50/month subscription BS.

I decided to treat it as a low-risk experiment. If it didn't work, I was only out a little cash, and they offered a decent guarantee.

# What actually is The Brain Song?

So, let's break down the tech behind the hype and the controversy. The audio program is based on the scientific principle of brainwave entrainment, which uses specific sound frequencies to influence brain states like focus and relaxation. It's a neuro-acoustic program that uses precise frequencies to gently guide your brain's electrical activity toward a Gamma wave state—linked to peak concentration and BDNF stimulation.

The catch? Brain Song's effectiveness is debated, with some users reporting significant improvements in memory and focus, while others report little to no change. However, individual results vary based on factors like overall health, consistency of use, and personal expectations, with some users noting disappointment if they expected an interactive program rather than a simple audio file. Essentially, you are passively 'listening' your way to better mental performance, but your personal experience will define the outcome.

# Does The Brain Song Actually Work?

When I first listened to it, I almost laughed. It’s not music; it’s a weird, pulsing, whooshing soundscape, often described as *brainwave entrainment* audio. It’s supposed to be guiding your brain into that Gamma wave state associated with deep learning and sharp focus.

Compared to nootropic supplements and brain-training apps, The Brain Song offers a non-invasive, time-efficient alternative that many users find effective—although results vary.

* **Week 1: Nothing.** Honestly, I just felt a little annoyed by the sound and kept checking the clock. The biggest benefit was just having 12 forced minutes of quiet time. I almost gave up.
* **Week 2: The Subtle Shift.** This is where I started noticing something. It wasn't a sudden burst of genius, but the afternoon slump wasn't as severe. Instead of hitting a wall at 3 PM, I felt a smoother decline in energy. My mental recall felt *less effortful*—I was pulling up names and facts just a tiny bit quicker.
* **Week 3 & 4: Consistency Pays Off.** I committed to listening first thing in the morning with good quality over-the-ear headphones. The biggest benefit for me now (30 days in) is **clarity and flow**. I still get distracted, but I snap back into focus faster. The ""fog"" is noticeably thinner. I feel like the *maximum* level of clarity I can achieve during the workday has been elevated.

**Verdict on Effectiveness:** Is it magic? No. Is it a replacement for good sleep and diet? Absolutely not. But as a daily, passive tool, I am genuinely impressed with the subtle cognitive boost. I’d estimate about 70-80% of the positive reviews I've read about improved focus and recall are aligned with my personal experience, *provided you use it every single day.*",1,1767593955.0,pppdizziness,0,1.0,False

okay, so now lets talk about its creator….  
  
The Brain Song was build by together by Dr. James Rivers and his crew over at Binaural Technologies.  
  
Dr. James Rivers, a neuroscientist trained by NASA, had a huge moment when he came across a Harvard study showing that 90-year-olds were better at memory and focus than 20-year-olds.  
  
he was curious about why some people stay sharp in their minds as they age while others have a hard time, he jumped into research that looked at 3,300 studies. What he found really changed the way we think about aging and the brain.  
  
From what he discovered, he created The Brain Song — a 7-minute audio program that uses soundwave tech to kickstart BDNF, which is the important protein for memory, focus, and keeping your brain healthy.  
  
**How to Use The Brain Song?**  
  
Using The Brain Song is super simple and really effective. Just follow these steps to tap into your brain’s full potential:  
  
Step 1: Find a Quiet Spot: Look for a calm place where you can sit or lie down without distractions. It’s a good idea to use headphones or earbuds for the best sound experience.  
  
Step 2: Pick Your Track: The Brain Song audio is in .m4a format and helps boost different mental states like clarity, focus, creativity, and relaxation. Choose the track that fits what you want to achieve today.  
  
Step 3: Listen Daily (10–15 Minutes): Tune in to the audio once a day, ideally in the morning or during a break when your brain is most awake. Doing this regularly gives you the best results.  
  
Step 4: Let It Flow: Don’t worry about trying to force your focus. Just relax, take some deep breaths, and let the sounds work their magic on your brain. Many people start feeling the benefits after just a few listens.  
  
  
  
Optional: Grab the PDF Guide: When you download, you’ll also get a PDF guide that explains how the audio works, the science behind it, and tips for getting the most out of it. Take a few minutes to check it out for a clearer understanding.

**How Does The Brain Song Work?**  
  
The Brain Song takes advantage of cool audio tech to boost your brainpower with sound.  
  
It features a bunch of specially made audio tracks that mix binaural beats, isochronic tones, and rhythmic sounds to tune into your brain’s frequencies.  
  
When you listen — especially with headphones — your brain starts syncing up with these sounds in a process called brainwave entrainment.  
  
Each track is made to bring out a specific mental state…..  
  
Alpha waves help you chill out and boost creativity. Beta waves keep you focused and alert. Theta waves get you deeply relaxed and let you tap into your subconscious.  
  
The Brain Song helps you sharpen your focus, clear your mind, boost your memory, and stabilize your emotions — all without using stimulants or any hard work.  
  
You’ll also get a PDF guide that shows you the best times and ways to use each track to see the best effects.  
  
It’s a safe and gentle way to unlock your brain’s full potential — great for anyone wanting to up their productivity, clear their thoughts, and relieve stress in just a few minutes each day….

Original User review : 

(Mark, 42, software dev here.) I’ve been lurking here for a while, watching the endless debates about nootropics and brain apps. I know the hype around ""The Brain Song"" is huge—you hear claims that **""It's safe, effective, and based on real science."" But (here comes the kicker), there are plenty of Brain Song enthusiasts out there messing up the message with unbelievable promises.** I was one of the biggest skeptics. An audio file that boosts my brain? It sounded like pure pseudoscience and snake oil, but the promise of improved focus finally wore me down. I had to know: **Does this thing actually work?**

My biggest pain point has always been the 3 PM slump. I work a demanding job that requires sharp memory recall and sustained focus, and lately, the mental fatigue has been brutal. I tried all the usual fixes: more caffeine (which gave me the jitters), meditation (which I wasn't consistent with), and expensive supplements (which did nothing but make my wallet lighter).

When I stumbled across The Brain Song, I saw two things that made me pause my scroll:

1. **The time commitment:** Just 12 minutes a day. That's less than my coffee break.
2. **The price structure:** **One-time payment.** No recurring $50/month subscription BS.

I decided to treat it as a low-risk experiment. If it didn't work, I was only out a little cash, and they offered a decent guarantee.

# What actually is The Brain Song?

So, let's break down the tech behind the hype and the controversy. The audio program is based on the scientific principle of brainwave entrainment, which uses specific sound frequencies to influence brain states like focus and relaxation. It's a neuro-acoustic program that uses precise frequencies to gently guide your brain's electrical activity toward a Gamma wave state—linked to peak concentration and BDNF stimulation.

The catch? Brain Song's effectiveness is debated, with some users reporting significant improvements in memory and focus, while others report little to no change. However, individual results vary based on factors like overall health, consistency of use, and personal expectations, with some users noting disappointment if they expected an interactive program rather than a simple audio file. Essentially, you are passively 'listening' your way to better mental performance, but your personal experience will define the outcome.

# Does The Brain Song Actually Work?

When I first listened to it, I almost laughed. It’s not music; it’s a weird, pulsing, whooshing soundscape, often described as *brainwave entrainment* audio. It’s supposed to be guiding your brain into that Gamma wave state associated with deep learning and sharp focus.

Compared to nootropic supplements and brain-training apps, The Brain Song offers a non-invasive, time-efficient alternative that many users find effective—although results vary.

* **Week 1: Nothing.** Honestly, I just felt a little annoyed by the sound and kept checking the clock. The biggest benefit was just having 12 forced minutes of quiet time. I almost gave up.
* **Week 2: The Subtle Shift.** This is where I started noticing something. It wasn't a sudden burst of genius, but the afternoon slump wasn't as severe. Instead of hitting a wall at 3 PM, I felt a smoother decline in energy. My mental recall felt *less effortful*—I was pulling up names and facts just a tiny bit quicker.
* **Week 3 & 4: Consistency Pays Off.** I committed to listening first thing in the morning with good quality over-the-ear headphones. The biggest benefit for me now (30 days in) is **clarity and flow**. I still get distracted, but I snap back into focus faster. The ""fog"" is noticeably thinner. I feel like the *maximum* level of clarity I can achieve during the workday has been elevated.

**Verdict on Effectiveness:** Is it magic? No. Is it a replacement for good sleep and diet? Absolutely not. But as a daily, passive tool, I am genuinely impressed with the subtle cognitive boost. I’d estimate about 70-80% of the positive reviews I've read about improved focus and recall are aligned with my personal experience, *provided you use it every single day.*",1,1767593946.0,pppdizziness,0,1.0,False

**How Does The Brain Song Work?**  
  
The Brain Song takes advantage of cool audio tech to boost your brainpower with sound.  
  
It features a bunch of specially made audio tracks that mix binaural beats, isochronic tones, and rhythmic sounds to tune into your brain’s frequencies.  
  
When you listen — especially with headphones — your brain starts syncing up with these sounds in a process called brainwave entrainment.  
  
Each track is made to bring out a specific mental state…..  
  
Alpha waves help you chill out and boost creativity. Beta waves keep you focused and alert. Theta waves get you deeply relaxed and let you tap into your subconscious.  
  
The Brain Song helps you sharpen your focus, clear your mind, boost your memory, and stabilize your emotions — all without using stimulants or any hard work.  
  
You’ll also get a PDF guide that shows you the best times and ways to use each track to see the best effects.  
  
It’s a safe and gentle way to unlock your brain’s full potential — great for anyone wanting to up their productivity, clear their thoughts, and relieve stress in just a few minutes each day….

Original User review : 

(Mark, 42, software dev here.) I’ve been lurking here for a while, watching the endless debates about nootropics and brain apps. I know the hype around ""The Brain Song"" is huge—you hear claims that **""It's safe, effective, and based on real science."" But (here comes the kicker), there are plenty of Brain Song enthusiasts out there messing up the message with unbelievable promises.** I was one of the biggest skeptics. An audio file that boosts my brain? It sounded like pure pseudoscience and snake oil, but the promise of improved focus finally wore me down. I had to know: **Does this thing actually work?**

My biggest pain point has always been the 3 PM slump. I work a demanding job that requires sharp memory recall and sustained focus, and lately, the mental fatigue has been brutal. I tried all the usual fixes: more caffeine (which gave me the jitters), meditation (which I wasn't consistent with), and expensive supplements (which did nothing but make my wallet lighter).

When I stumbled across The Brain Song, I saw two things that made me pause my scroll:

1. **The time commitment:** Just 12 minutes a day. That's less than my coffee break.
2. **The price structure:** **One-time payment.** No recurring $50/month subscription BS.

I decided to treat it as a low-risk experiment. If it didn't work, I was only out a little cash, and they offered a decent guarantee.

# What actually is The Brain Song?

So, let's break down the tech behind the hype and the controversy. The audio program is based on the scientific principle of brainwave entrainment, which uses specific sound frequencies to influence brain states like focus and relaxation. It's a neuro-acoustic program that uses precise frequencies to gently guide your brain's electrical activity toward a Gamma wave state—linked to peak concentration and BDNF stimulation.

The catch? Brain Song's effectiveness is debated, with some users reporting significant improvements in memory and focus, while others report little to no change. However, individual results vary based on factors like overall health, consistency of use, and personal expectations, with some users noting disappointment if they expected an interactive program rather than a simple audio file. Essentially, you are passively 'listening' your way to better mental performance, but your personal experience will define the outcome.

# Does The Brain Song Actually Work?

When I first listened to it, I almost laughed. It’s not music; it’s a weird, pulsing, whooshing soundscape, often described as *brainwave entrainment* audio. It’s supposed to be guiding your brain into that Gamma wave state associated with deep learning and sharp focus.

Compared to nootropic supplements and brain-training apps, The Brain Song offers a non-invasive, time-efficient alternative that many users find effective—although results vary.

* **Week 1: Nothing.** Honestly, I just felt a little annoyed by the sound and kept checking the clock. The biggest benefit was just having 12 forced minutes of quiet time. I almost gave up.
* **Week 2: The Subtle Shift.** This is where I started noticing something. It wasn't a sudden burst of genius, but the afternoon slump wasn't as severe. Instead of hitting a wall at 3 PM, I felt a smoother decline in energy. My mental recall felt *less effortful*—I was pulling up names and facts just a tiny bit quicker.
* **Week 3 & 4: Consistency Pays Off.** I committed to listening first thing in the morning with good quality over-the-ear headphones. The biggest benefit for me now (30 days in) is **clarity and flow**. I still get distracted, but I snap back into focus faster. The ""fog"" is noticeably thinner. I feel like the *maximum* level of clarity I can achieve during the workday has been elevated.

**Verdict on Effectiveness:** Is it magic? No. Is it a replacement for good sleep and diet? Absolutely not. But as a daily, passive tool, I am genuinely impressed with the subtle cognitive boost. I’d estimate about 70-80% of the positive reviews I've read about improved focus and recall are aligned with my personal experience, *provided you use it every single day.*",1,1767593940.0,pppdizziness,0,1.0,False

1q4e292,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q4e292/aitah_for_telling_my_friend_i_was_upset_after_her/,AITAH for telling my friend I was upset after her blowing me off for my birthday because she got married for the 3rd time?,"Please be gentle in explaining this to me, I am already feeling sensitive. I have posted about this before in a different reddit, and the verdict was that I am a dormat. However, this was before the person responded to me explaining themselves after I said my feelings the first time (so basically an update). 

So basically yes the title sounds crazy but it's true let me explain. So basically I was childhood best friends with this person, known them for almost my entire life. It has been a tradition to celebrate birthdays together. She moved out of state two years ago. During that time, she had a destination wedding, then a couple months later a wedding here, and then a couple years later court married all to the same person. I'm not sure how the marriage is going as they live in seperate houses (for reasons I won't get into) and she almost never talks about him. 

She keeps bringing up herself (I'm not initiating or inviting myself) for almost a year straight she wants me to visit her and will check her schedule, but she never does so I assume it won't happen which is fine. 

okay so the backstory: On my birthday she texts me that she is coming to my state and she says that we will celebrate my milestone birthday dinner when she comes down. She gets here, and we meet for bubble tea and I mention it, and she says something kind of evasive about going to different houses. She also anounces at the coffee shop that they are getting legally married. 

  
The next day, she texts me that she has plans to go to a VR thing, and invites me to go with a group of people, while giving me an hour to decide so ""she doesn't miss out on the tickets."" I see on the website, it is cheaper if more people are in the group so I assume that is the only reason I am last minute invited. 

I tell her I can't afford it right now and thank her for the invitiation, and ask if the group was meeting for lunch and she says they might she will let me know. The day of the VR event, she gives me an hour notice that they are meeting for lunch. Mind you, the place they are meeting at is half an hour away so that gives me a 30 minute buffer. Now I am all for spontinaty, but because this is a group even that feels weird. I mean they had to have known they were meeting more than an hour before? idk. 

  
I miss the message and tell her that I hope they had fun. She says yes. I ask if she is free to celebrate, and she tells me again she wasnt sure. Anyway below is the exchange..

  
 BELOW IS A TRANSCRIPT OF THE LAST EXCHANGE:

(she ghosted me after the following message) Me: On my birthday you messaged me that we would go out to celebrate my thirtieth birthday when you came down here. I understand if you are busy with the limited time you have here and have priorities. I think if the shoe was on the other foot, it wouldn’t feel too good. I would have much rather preferred you not say anything about celebrating. Anyway have a good night it was nice to get coffee with you. 

(no response for acouple days so i sent) : Hope everything went well today at the court house 👰

  
Her:  just want to clear up a couple things. Whenever I visit, I try to make time to see you and I had a nice time over coffee with you. I appreciated spending time with you and really loved your thoughtful gift. When I planned to celebrate together, that was my intention and I’m sorry it didn’t pan out exactly that way. This was also before we decided we’d do our court wedding during the visit. 

It wasn’t personal but there were important things I had to get done in the limited time I was in \[the state\]. I think it’s a little unfair you’d assume I’d feel that way the other way around because truthfully I would’ve been understanding to what was going on. To be honest, it was stressful coordinating with multiple courts and family members to make this work. I hope to see you soon and we’ll try to plan something when I’m in town or you’re up by me!

Me: I’m surprised you said that because you would get angry at me for not texting you at midnight on your birthday. Regardless, I have my own feelings about it. I am hurt that you don’t understand why this would upset me. It has always been a tradition to do something together. I tried to be understanding to you, while still telling you how your actions made me feel. Like I said, I understand you have priorities truly I do. I would have appreciated you letting me know you couldn’t instead of the evasiveness, which is what I was trying to say. 

Separately, actions speak louder than words for me. If you really really wanted to make time, you would have as evidenced by the plans you made with other friends and gave me an hour heads up twice. I know you keep mentioning me visiting, but you’ve been talking about looking at your schedule for almost a year. I could understand if this was in isolation, but this isn’t a one time thing.

I don’t expect to be priority which is why I told you I understand you have other priorities and I know multitasking is stressful, but at least would appreciate not being taken for granted and have my feelings recognized.

Her:	Hurting you was never my intention. I don’t really feel the need to address everything right now or explain my schedule during the holidays. I’ll give you some space if you need it. 

Me: If my message comes across as asking you to explain things, that is not my intention. Space already is a thing. Hope you have a good first week of the new year	Space meaning I addressed those things to you because I was telling you how I feel. but I give you space	Also explaining things ATP would come across to me as excuses tbh	Lastly, I express my feelings. And you tell me you “dont feel the need to address” them. That feels very dismissive",1,1767593634.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

Ever feel like your bank account is just… *there*? Sitting quietly, not doing much besides paying bills and maybe funding the occasional coffee run? What if I told you that same account could be working *way* harder for you—like, ""early retirement"" or ""dream vacation fund"" harder?

Most of us underestimate how much our savings could actually grow. A few small tweaks, a little strategy, and suddenly, that ""meh"" balance starts looking like a golden ticket. Here’s how to make it happen:

### **1. The ""Lazy Money"" Audit**
- **Check your accounts.** How much is just *sitting* in a low-interest savings account? (Spoiler: It’s probably earning pennies.)
- **Move it to high-yield savings or investments.** Even a 4% APY beats 0.01%—*big time.*
- **Pro tip:** Automate transfers so you never ""forget"" to grow your money.

### **2. The ""Future You"" Trick**
- **Visualize your goal.** Want to retire at 50? Buy a house? Travel the world? Give that dream a dollar amount.
- **Use a retirement calculator.** (You might be richer than you think—[find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb).)
- **Small steps add up.** Even an extra $100/month invested now could mean *thousands* later.

### **3. The ""Spend Smarter"" Hack**
- **Cut one unnecessary expense.** That $10 subscription? The daily takeout? Redirect it to savings.
- **Use cashback apps.** Free money for stuff you’re already buying? Yes, please.
- **Bonus:** Track your spending for a month—you’ll spot leaks *fast.*

### **4. The ""Side Hustle Boost""**
- **Turn a skill into cash.** Freelance, sell old stuff, tutor—whatever. Even $200 extra/month = $2,400/year.
- **Invest the profits.** Don’t just spend it; let it compound.

### **The Bottom Line**
Your money *can* work for you—you just have to tell it where to go. Start small, stay consistent, and watch how quickly ""not enough"" turns into ""more than I thought.""

Here are the options that I have thought:
1. Moccamaster for full automation. When the coffee is done I just throw away the filter with the coffee and rinse the carafe. I understand that the quality will be a bit lower than a full manual V60. I drink 3 cups per day so this option will make my life easier because I will brew all the coffee at once. 
2. Hario switch or clever dripper. Again easiness with cleaning by just throwing away the filter. But I have no experience with those droppers.

I don't even know where to start, so I guess some small background. I, 17 F, have been with my bf, 19 M, for just over 10 months. It is great, but his family and relationship with his family have had some bad effects on us. He is African, and I understand that there will be some cultural differences between our families, but how his parents treat him and his siblings is not okay and is abuse. Let me start by saying his parents are financially stable and have enough money to take trips to other states just for parties, and his mom will spend so much money on clothes and other luxury items for herself that she is not caring for her kids.Let's start with her youngest and go to the oldest (my boyfriend). His younger brother, 3M, is super cute and sweet, but he is losing weight and stuck in a dirty house with little to no guidance and no supervision. He is 3 but still can't talk a lot. I know what autism looks like in younger kids, and that's not the reason he can't really talk. He can't speak English or their native language because they don't talk to him enough. He doesn't understand how to communicate past pointing and making grunting sounds. He has gotten so much better with me being over there and learning how to speak from me hanging out with him, but he is not at the level he needs to be because all his mom does is hand him a screen and feed him occasionally. His diet is simple, and all he really eats is rice and beans, and he doesn't have a bedtime or his own bed. He sleeps with some of the other children, and sometimes they can't find him because he is unsupervised 99% of the time. From when he was potty training up until I told his older sister that he needed a diaper change, his mom would only change his diaper once a day and once at night. Don't even get me started on the living conditions of him. There are bugs everywhere, and his mom is super abusive and will hit and scream at him when he doesn't even understand what she is saying because he has been neglected to the point where he didn't learn any language. He is improving now that he goes to preschool, and his language has gotten better because I have helped him, but I am not his mom, and he is still going to bed at 1 or 2 am because they just let him roam free all the time.

Next are his two middle brothers, 9M and 12M; they are also abused. They lack clothes and basic hygiene supplies and medical care. I finally took one of them to the dentist, and it was so bad that they asked him if he drank coffee because the stains were so bad. He has a toothbrush, but they never tell him to brush his teeth, and sometimes he loses his toothbrush and shares with other people in the house. Now, for their food, they eat meat that is not safe and other food full of other bacteria and pathogens because the fridge does not work, so they are constantly eating unsafe foods. The 12M doesn't have deodorant and smells super bad because his mom won't give him any. My boyfriend and I have provided him with the [essentials.One](http://essentials.one/) time he was bullied at school for being ashy, and he came home and used his mom's lotion because the week prior he asked her for some, and she didn't give him any, but to top it all off, when he used her lotion, she slapped him. Living conditions are the same for them, and they even had to share underwear. The 9-year-old is about 120 pounds, and the 12-year-old is 5'6"" and 280 pounds. So you can see the problem in sizing and just how gross it is to share underwear. They don't have a proper place to sleep or put their clothes, so I got them a dresser, but the grandma came to stay at their house, so the dresser went to her, and so did the only source of light for their room: lamps I bought them. They keep their clothes in bins, and crazy enough, they have a closet, but in there are their mom's extra clothes because that's where she spends all her money: on her clothes. They sleep on one mattress on the floor, with no mattress cover or bed frame. But when the grandma came over, she bought her all new stuff and gave her my boyfriend's room, and now it is winter break, and he has to sleep on a couch, but I will get more into that later.

His little sister is 16 F and is forced to clean the house and try to make do with the lack of food when they go for parties. She is older, so she has a job and has enough money to buy her own supplies, so my boyfriend and I don't buy her as much stuff. She basically has raised the littlest, but she shouldn't have to be a mom to him, so when she goes to work or needs a break, he is left all alone. One time the parents left for 2 days and left her $20 for pizza, and she had to take out Instapay so she could feed them because the only other food left in the house was rice. She has told me she hates pizza now, but she can't drive, so that was all she could do for them. It was winter, and the closest store was a few miles away.

Now, my boyfriend. My sweet baby, whom I love more than life itself, has now escaped from them for the most part. He went off to college, but he is home for winter break now and has to sleep there. 99% of the time he is working or with me because after he has opened his eyes to the abuse he and his sibling have endured, it's just hard for him to be there. Again, his grandma came over from Africa, and now he is forced to sleep on a couch because his mom took his room and gave it to her. He is on his own for food and everything else. Worst of all is his mom's greed for money. She took his tax return last year, and she took $500 of the $1000 he got for his graduation party and stole so much more from him, not for her needs, but for her wants for more clothes and shoes and parties. He was left to work and work for the things he needed for college. Just the filth they live in is legit; one time she had ""just mopped the floors, but it turned my sock brown after 10 minutes."" The lack of healthy or safe food and the abuse of her hitting them and emotionally abusing them by calling them stupid and the R-slur in her language is horrible. Their dad is better, but he never stands up for them on the clothes and their basic needs not being met. He has never told her to stop spending $200 of her $900 a week on clothes. I want to call CPS, but I don't know how that would play out, and I'm scared. I know that there may be cultural differences but this isn't right. She doesn't really care for them. And not all people from Africa are like this. I know people from all over the world are also like this. I just feel trapped.",2,1767593086.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

But I was still waking up exhausted every single morning. That is when it hit me that sleep is not just about fixing one thing. It is your routine, your mental state, your bedroom environment, all of it needs to work together.
What actually made a difference was tackling all three at once instead of just one. I kept up the routine stuff, no screens before bed, cutting off caffeine early. On the mental side I worked on actually winding down at night instead of going straight from stressed to sleep. But the environment part was where I had been completely blind. I started looking at my bedroom differently. Not just is it clean but what is actually in the air I am breathing all night.

First thing I did was actually pay attention to my bedding. Got some comfortable clean sheets and fresh pillowcases. Sounds basic but I realized I had been kind of lazy about it. But then I thought, okay even with clean stuff on top, what about what is underneath?

 Turns out even though I had a mattress protector on, I had never really deep cleaned the actual mattress itself. I only ever dealt with the surface level stuff. So I started properly vacuuming the mattress too.Then I made sure fresh air was coming in regularly instead of keeping everything sealed up. Even in winter when it is freezing I crack the window open for a few minutes then close it again. And I stopped using those air fresheners that just mask smells instead of fixing what is actually causing them.

I also looked into melatonin. Some people swear by it for getting back on track after travel or night shifts. Might help short term but long term use apparently is not great. Your body starts producing less naturally and you end up feeling even groggier in the mornings. It is more of a quick fix than a real solution.

1q4dp4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildrenofDeadParents/comments/1q4dp4j/my_dad_drowned_in_august_of_2025/,My dad drowned in August of 2025,"My dad and I had a very strained relationship. My parents split when I was 8. I’m now 32. He suffered a severe mental health and depressive episode that he couldn’t recover from. My mom was a stay at home mom with 4 young kids and my dad was the sole provider. She ultimately left him due to his drinking and other reasons involving an affair. My dad never recovered and only became more depressed and anxious. We weren’t allowed to see him because he’d show up intoxicated trying to take us with him. It was about a year after the divorce where we were finally able to go with him. He would drive us to our old family home and drink and cry with us just sitting in the car with him.

Anyways, the years after that our contact was limited and strained. We’d make an effort to see him for holidays, birthdays, or at least send him a message. He was living with one of his sisters for a while but eventually moved in with his mom. This is where things just got to a point beyond repair. His mom, my grandma, was not kind to him or to anyone. She wouldn’t let him watch anything he wanted to watch or rarely let him leave. In 2024, she had a stroke which left my dad being her full time caregiver. This made her attachment to him even worse. He couldn’t do anything without her berating him. I had asked him to come help me paint my new house, but he couldn’t because he had to take care of his mom. This hurt me deeply. Choosing her over seeing me and my son who was only 7 or 8 months at the time.

In June of 2025, my dad had his brother watch my grandma while he went out. Unfortunately, she ended up choking while my uncle fed her which she never recovered from. She passed away several weeks later and my dad was so, so broken and devastated. He called me when she was in the hospital asking if I could be there to support him. I obliged but truthfully, I didn’t want to be there. He was sober when I was with him that week which was so nice. It made it easier to be around him. During one of the hospital visits, my dad told me that he had overdosed about a week prior after he blamed himself for being the reason his mom choked. He said he drank a lot that day and reached a point where he took all of the cocaine he had on him. The next day he woke up in the hospital and had no idea what happened. The doctors told him he very likely received cocaine that was laced with fentanyl. Officers administered CPR and Narcan which left him with broken ribs. I immediately broke down crying when he told me this. My dad almost died and I had no idea. He told me he was so scared and knew he didn’t want to die. He wanted to live and that experience scared him so much that he wanted to be here with us. For the first time ever, I told him how I felt. How angry I was at him for making me feel unworthy and unloved. Saying he couldn’t even sober up for his kids or grandchildren. I told him I didn’t want him to die and that I wanted to have a relationship with him and I wanted him to know my son. We cried and just talked. He said he never knew how I felt and thanked me for telling him. For all those years he thought I wanted nothing to do with him anymore and believed I didn’t need him. For the first time since the divorce I felt so much hope that we’d have some kind of relationship even if it wasn’t perfect. Especially considering his mom wasn’t in the picture anymore, I thought I’d have more time with him. I literally pictured him going on walks with my son and I. I pictured him pushing his grandson on a swing.

For my grandmothers services, my dad asked me to pick him up and drive him to the wake. I agreed but I asked him not to drink. I picked him up and he seemed fine. Somehow while we were there, he started drinking even though I barely left his side. He ended up getting so beyond intoxicated towards the end. By this point my husband had showed up with our son. I was so angry!! He ended up trying to hold my son and I yelled at him not to touch him and that he was scaring him. I had my husband take our son him and I fought with my dad to get him to leave with me. I eventually he agreed and got in the car. But the drive to his home was awful. He kept saying he’s tired of women telling him what to do. I’m not sure if it’s rooted from his mom never letting him leave or do anything? He kept threatening to jump out of the car and kept yelling at me to take him to my house. I really wanted to, but I knew i couldn’t allow my son to see him like that or be around him when he was so drunk. I ended taking him to his apartment and screaming at him to get out of the fu\*\*ing car. He got out and stumbled away. My dad had never spoken like that to me.

I never saw my dad alive again.

He texted me days after I dropped him off as if nothing had happened. Eventually I answered one of his calls and he acted like nothing ever happened. I finally asked him if he even remembered what happened. He said no, so I told him. He was so embarrassed and had no recollection of it. He said he was ashamed and just kept apologizing profusely. During this time, my husband was having our barn expanded and the contractor needed help. I asked my dad if he was willing to help and he agreed. He was so excited. I later found out that he kept bringing it up and kept expressing how excited he was to help. He finally felt like I needed him again. Honestly, I was so excited too. More flashes of him playing with his grandson, of him and I having our coffee outside together. Eating breakfast together. I was excited, but I was also hesitant of allowing him into my home with my 2 year old around. I didn’t want him drinking around my son or bringing drugs into our home. This led me to ignore his messages and delay the process. I knew I would have him over, I just kept delaying.

Then I decided to go on a last minute trip with my sister and our children to visit my aunt in Kansas City. I promised myself I’d have him come by after we got back. The day before we were supposed to drive back, I got a text from my aunt that I’ll never forget. “911. Emergency. Call me”. I called her and she was so frantic I couldn’t understand her. Your dad drowned. He’s missing we can’t find him. Honestly everything was kind of a blur after that. I reached out to some cop friends to pull up the call and sure enough, man possibly drowned and hadn’t resurfaced. I asked them to keep me updated. For whatever reason I didn’t think to reach out to my husband sooner but he’s a cop too and was working in a nearby town. I called him and he went over there so I could get real time updates. They called it at 10 pm and would resume the next morning. He left with the lead detectives phone number. We thought about driving back that night, but we had precious cargo (my 2 year old, and my sisters 2 and 3 year old girls). That night was awful. We didn’t get any answers. The next morning, we set out to make the dreadful drive back not knowing if he was dead, or if he managed to make his way out of the water and passed out somewhere. The woman he was with was so drugged out she couldn’t say for certain if he made it out or not.

The drive home was painful. So much anxiety and fear knowing what we were coming home to. We finally made it back home and left the kids with my sisters husband. My husband was on his way to pick up our son. After my sister and I unloaded the car and were about to head to the forest preserve, my husband opened the front door. It was written on his face. I just knew it. It wasn’t good news or the news we hoped for. Truth is, during that 8 hour drive I kept looking at each passing hour and just knew. The reality became clearing with each hour of driving. My husband asked us to wait for my brother and mom to join us then we could head out. Well my stubborn sister and I said no and tried pushing past him. He wouldn’t let us leave. We weren’t giving up, so he finally said the words.

They found your dad.

He got the call when he was driving to meet me at my sisters house. His body resurfaced and was in the process of being recovered.

I am so angry with myself. I should’ve been kinder and tried to be more understanding. With any death, stories emerge afterwards about the deceased. About their childhood, upbringing, struggles, fears and their feelings. Things I wish so badly I knew before he died. This part has killed me on the inside. I thought we weren’t good enough for him and he didn’t love us enough to sober up. He suffered so damn much in his life.  I view him so differently now. This pain is sometimes unbearable. I constantly have images flash into my mind of that switch between struggling and surrendering to his death. The image haunts me every single day and multiple times throughout the day.

If you’ve made it this far, thank you. I kindly ask that you not speak negatively about my father. I’m struggling enough and don’t need to see that.",3,1767592457.0,ChildrenofDeadParents,0,1.0,False

I really enjoyed working in a bookstore, but this new opportunity came up from a friend and my family has been waiting for me to get a grown up job that pays a bit more so I felt compelled to take it.  

My only problem is that it’s terrible.  Im trying to work through it on that idea of ‘it takes a year to settle into a new job’ but my bosses are maliciously toxic, the work is unrewarding and difficult, and im the most stressed I’ve ever been and it is only getting worse. I’ve been applying to jobs that resemble times I’ve been happy (hands on, creative) like in flower shops, libraries, coffee shops but the pay is worse and I wouldn’t be guaranteed insurance. 

I work with one of my best friends and she feels the same, so I know it’s not just me. Everyday we fantasize about leaving. Right now in my pain it feels completely worth it to have my life back, so many people dream of sitting at a desk—but I genuinely don’t know how much longer I can take this (or at the very least this desk).

I need someone to give it to me straight(especially in this economy)—should I suffer through this? Has anyone ever left corporate/office for a job considered a “downgrade” and felt better??

But sometimes his self-proclaimed OCD gets in the way (I don’t think he has OCD since he himself says it as a joke, but I’m also aware that it’s a spectrum). Like i was diagnosed with adhd but he thinks im joking like him and doesnt think i need help even tho i tell him i do, that life feels hard for me. He is quite openly racist and makes insensitive jokes. I think he severly lacks empathy in general. 

Recently, we got into a fight after a long time of me adjusting and not complaining too much over the thermostat being at 66°F even in peak winter. I have always had trouble handling colder temperatures, so I begged him to please increase it to 68. At least I would have preferred 70 for a few hours and then back to whatever he liked before bed, because then I could be under many blankets. Otherwise, it’s hard to walk around the apartment when you’re feeling cold. He says we have to learn to adjust, but I think he means that I need to adjust to his needs. Because for almost a year, he didn’t give me a proper blanket and let me sleep with a sheet while he slept with a thicker blanket, since that was “his” blanket. IDK what that means when you’re almost 30 and your GF is freezing to death and you won’t even turn up the thermostat. EDIT: I remember,  he said i should bring my own blanket if im uncomfortable. And after about a year like a month ago he bought a new blanket because "" oh i just loved the blanket and its gonna keep me warm now that its winter. As an afterthought hes like its so big we can share it too like i should be grateful he did that. Even tho he def did that for himself

Often, when I’m sick or on my period, he barely asks how I feel and what I need, and he thinks if he asks once a day, that’s good enough. And I should be up for sex even when I’m low on energy during these times. He thinks it’s a joke. Like, I’m sorry, I don’t know what’s funny about you not letting me rest while saying, “Oh, you don’t even need to do anything, I’ll do everything.” He makes jokes during serious situations, btw. His first reaction is to see if i stained his couch or his car seat. He barely has asked the first question to be about me. He also expects me to sit over a plastic cover when im on my period. Idk how i feel about that i dont think id even make my friend do that. 

I forgave a lot of things in the past, like him keeping stuff from his past relationship right in the living room, and when I would ask him to keep it in storage, he would say, “It doesn’t bother me, though , I don’t even see it.” BUT I DO. It bothered me, and he never bothered to do it, so I adjusted.

Am I the asshole for reading too much into this? How do I fix this with him?

Edit: he does do things for me and tries to take care of me. But i just find it confusing whether hes doing it to take care of me or doing it because its comfortable while hes doing his own things.  Like making extra serving for me. Or doing laundry. Or making extra coffee so he can give me (i dont like coffee tho i have told him for a year now but i think he expects me to eventually like it so he keeps making me drink it or keeps asking me until i say yes). He carries bags sometimes too. He says he would cook too but i would just have to watch him and tell him what to do while he stirs etc. He doesnt know how to cook and always expects me to take the lead. He says he contributes by asking and learning and watching me do it ",1,1767592043.0,AITAH,9,0.67,False

***Chapter 24:***

Naomi didn’t mean to make a report.

She meant to make a record.

There was a difference—at least, there had always been a difference in her head. Reports belonged to people who wanted outcomes. Records belonged to people who wanted to understand what had already happened without being forced to say why.

She sat in Camila’s kitchen with her laptop open and the blinds half-drawn against a pale afternoon. The apartment smelled like detergent and cold coffee. Camila was upstairs, shower running, a small mercy of noise in a space that had learned silence too well.

Naomi clicked through the city’s website the way she clicked through everything: fast, clean, unimpressed.

The portal asked for categories.

Public safety.  
 Parks and recreation.  
 Infrastructure.

She chose infrastructure.

It felt harmless. Almost boring. A request about lights. About signage. About maintenance schedules. The kind of thing people filed when they wanted to complain without being accused of drama.

She filled in the location: **Edgewater Park — lakeshore path lighting**.

Date range: last twelve months.

Reason for request: she paused.

Naomi hated this part. The little blank space where systems demanded you narrate your need in a tone they could digest.

She typed:

**Personal safety concerns. Seeking clarification on maintenance and hazard mitigation.**

It was true. Just not complete.

She didn’t add names. Didn’t add a story. Didn’t mention a body. Didn’t mention a survivor.

She hit submit.

A small spinner turned.

Then the screen thanked her.

REQUEST RECEIVED.

A case number appeared beneath it—thin, official, unearned.

Naomi stared at it a beat longer than necessary.

This is nothing, she told herself.

This is how people protect themselves. This is how you get a streetlight fixed. This is how you make a city admit it’s responsible for the places it pretends are neutral.

Her phone buzzed.

An email arrived instantly—too instantly.

**Public Records Request Confirmation**  
 Your request has been received and assigned the following tracking number…

Naomi didn’t open it.

She knew what it would say. She had written enough polite requests in her life to predict the whole shape of the response.

Still, the speed bothered her.

Systems weren’t supposed to move quickly unless something was already waiting underneath.

Camila came downstairs, wrapped in a towel, hair wet, face clean in that way grief never touched. She looked smaller without her armor on.

“You hungry?” Camila asked, voice soft.

Naomi shut the laptop like it was nothing. Like she hadn’t just pushed her thumb into a machine that liked to remember.

“Always,” Naomi said.

Camila nodded, almost grateful for something normal to do. She went to the fridge. Naomi watched her move through the kitchen like someone learning their own house again.

“You ever think about leaving?” Naomi asked, carefully. Not suggesting. Just opening the door.

Camila froze for half a second. Then shook her head once.

“No,” she said. “I don’t want the city to keep it.”

Naomi’s jaw tightened—not disagreement. Recognition.

“Okay,” she said. “Then we don’t.”

Camila turned back to the fridge. Naomi kept her tone light. She asked about groceries. About a show she’d watched on the plane. About nothing.

But inside, she felt the case number sitting in her bag like a coin in a pocket—small, undeniable, loud if you listened too closely.

—

Across town, Amira felt the shift before she saw it.

She was halfway through a walk she’d taken for years—an unremarkable loop through blocks that held no meaning and therefore stayed safe. The air was cold enough to sting her lungs. The sky had gone colorless, the kind of gray that made everything look equally innocent.

Her phone didn’t buzz.

That was the point. The system didn’t always announce itself. It adjusted.

She passed a community board outside the library—flyers layered over flyers, torn edges, phone numbers half-missing. A new notice sat pinned dead center, printed on white paper as it mattered.

**CITY OF CLEVELAND**  
 **PUBLIC SAFETY NOTICE**  
 **EDGEWATER PARK — LAKESHORE PATH**  
 **LIGHTING IMPROVEMENTS SCHEDULED**  
 **TEMPORARY SIGNAGE INSTALLED**  
 For questions, reference case number: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Amira didn’t stop.

She didn’t have to.

Her eyes caught the blank line where the number had been torn away, the paper ripped cleanly as if someone had removed the only part that made it real.

That, more than the notice itself, tightened something behind her ribs.

Not fear.

Irritation.

Because this wasn’t reactive. This wasn’t grief. This wasn’t one family making noise.

This was administrative.

Someone had touched the machine the right way.

She kept walking, pace unchanged, hands loose at her sides. Around her, people moved with the same unthinking confidence they always did—heads down, earbuds in, bodies assuming the world would keep holding.

Assumption was the city’s favorite religion.

At the corner, a patrol car rolled past slower than necessary. Not looking at her. Not looking at anyone. Just moving through a route like it had been told to feel present.

Presence was cheaper than attention.

Amira turned onto a side street and felt the hum under her feet try to settle—then fail. The sensation wasn’t mystical. It was simpler than that. A practiced awareness of how environments held you.

And today, the environment held itself differently.

She reached her building and paused at the entrance, not because anything was wrong, but because the vestibule light had been replaced. Brighter bulb. Cleaner glow. Newer.

Someone was making sure dark spaces stayed less dark.

She walked inside anyway.

Upstairs, she locked her door and stood still, listening to the building breathe—pipes, footsteps, a neighbor’s television leaking muffled laughter through the wall.

She didn’t go to the window this time.

She went to her kitchen table and sat down like she was waiting for something to arrive.

Not a knock.

Not a call.

A consequence.

Her phone stayed quiet.

That was how she knew it wasn’t personal.

Yet.

Someone was filing.

Someone was requesting.

Someone was creating a paper trail in a city that loved paper trails because paper trails replaced looking.

Amira stared at the blank tabletop until her eyes stopped searching for meaning and started counting risk.

Edgewater was no longer just a place.

It was a file.

Files moved.

Files got forwarded.

Files got copied.

She exhaled slowly.

Adaptation wasn’t panic. It was practice.

Still, she couldn’t ignore the smallest new truth settling into her body with the weight of something inevitable:

The system didn’t have to know her name to start building a shape around it.

And once a shape existed, the city would begin doing what it always did when it was afraid of what it might find—

It would ask for more documentation

1q4djyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1q4djyk/most_iconic_culturally_influential_neighborhoods/,"Most iconic, culturally influential neighborhoods in SF?","The city has a crazy outsized amount of long-standing famous neighborhoods that manage to feel immediately distinct from each other but also cohesively part of the broader city. And I’m wondering how we would rank their level of impact, of the most well known. I have some that come to mind but want to hear your thoughts:

1. Chinatown — I struggle to think of a more iconic neighborhood in the US tbh, maybe the NoLA French Quarter. SF’s Chinatown was *the* first, established the idea of Chinatowns everywhere, and made the connection between East and West that had originally spurred the age of exploration. As much racism as underlies it, the exoticized architecture is iconic and very SF, so hilly, great views, excellent location in the middle of a lot of other iconic SF history & culture. Also super impactful in Chinese revolutionary history.

2. The Haight — the hippie movement influence and aesthetic is kind of unmatched in its recognizably distinct iconicism while really feeling like a *neighborhood*. Some of the best access to Golden Gate Park. I wasn’t there for the Summer of Love though, so maybe I’m overhyping it?

3. The Castro — I’m gay, and SF as the early face and epicenter of gay culture cannot be understated. The pride flag comes right from Castro St, and I feel that being here. I feel like visually the Castro is a little less compelling than these others (comparing to the most remarkable areas in SF lol), as much as it still makes my jaw drop on the daily living here now.  Dolores Park is also my favorite place on Earth.

4. The Mission — Home to the oldest building in the city, has lots of Palm Trees, and the Mission just feels so culturally vibrant in that SF progressive core way. Where the Spanish set up and now a center for Hispanic immigrants, which feels like it represents SF well as a place for immigrants from around the world. So much good food in the Mission, basically credited with the well-known, modern American burrito (mission-style), which is pretty interesting.

5. The Embarcadero — Sort of including downtown on this one, the skyscrapers, ferry building, the whole Embarcadero coast is so beautiful and iconic. Ferry building, historic streetcars, palm trees, really amazing views of the Bay, Bay Bridge, steep Telegraph Hill + Coit Tower, and other icons. Especially if we include the area from Oracle Park to Fisherman’s Wharf, this area is super iconic and includes a lot of SF history + major tech company locations.

6. The Marina / Presidio — Ngl, maybe these just give me a sense of the wealth and access in SF? The view looking north to the Bay at all the gorgeous boats and geography, capped off by the Golden Gate Bridge, is outrageously iconic.

7. Outer Richmond — the iconic SF cool, foggy ocean weather of the avenues surrounded by incredibly diverse nature + park space (GGP, Land’s End, Baker Beach, Presidio, Golden Gate Bridge views) are stunningly packed in here. The quieter pace of life and cozy coffee spots around here are really nice and leave an imprint on me too.

8. The Tenderloin — I love the Tenderloin, really. And I’m okay with its reputation. It obviously has a big reputation lol. And that is part of SF’s culture. Very concentrated, lowkey still among beautiful SF architecture and urban access. I feel like the Tenderloin shows that even the most extreme areas of SF seriously have a lot of pro’s still. And also represents the wealth inequality in the city, which is obviously not a good thing but symbolically relevant.

9. Nob Hill — Great views, some city history, makes me think of SF about 100 years ago. I point out Nob Hill to represent the neighborhoods with the most intensely steep hills, which are very iconic to SF. Think Twin Peaks and Bernal Heights too.

10. Mission Bay — new development in SF that isn’t totally lacking style but obviously sterile and modern by comparison, attracts lots of corporations SF is famous for.


This is just a short list from my opinions, so it’s okay if your list isn’t the same. Which neighborhood in the city do you think deserves more recognition for its aesthetic, history, and influence?",0,1767591996.0,sanfrancisco,10,0.43,False

During that time I made no attempt at getting with her and we seemed to respect our boundaries, granted we were very nice to each other, and talked a lot, as our work was literally next door, she even gave me her phone number at first because she was interested in a job at my place of work. Fast forward to November and the girl that I was dating didn’t work out and we ended the relationship after 3.5 years.

I took a break from going to her work since I’ve been busy with my job and other things. I went back a couple of weeks ago and we rekindled, she was quite happy to see me and we began talking again as if we never lost touch. By this point she doesn’t know that I’m single yet. So the friendship goes on for another week and I decide to actually text her for the first time(the only contact we had ever had was in person, never through text) so I text her asking her if she likes coffee. No response. Weird, so I go to see her later that day and I ask her jokingly about the message I sent and how I got no reply. She immediately responds with “oh I actually got a new number, here I’ll give you my new one” bang got her new number.

Now we’re actually “full on” texting, I put that in quotations cause although we’ve been talking, she doesn’t really carry on with the conversation. Before you ask, no I’m not the pushy or type of person to keep pressuring a response. Weirdly enough, she the one that initiates the conversation with a “hi, how are you” “how’s your day going” stuff like that but when I reply. Boom. Vanishes, sometimes for a few hours and sometimes a day. Not sure what the deal with this is, we’ve had some steady convos since texting but this just seems unusual, has this ever happened to anyone? A little more context, I don’t think she knows I’m single, I haven’t really brought up my ended relationship as I think it’d be weird to just bring up the fact that “oh btw I’m single”, she knows the type of person I am and how loyal I’ve been with said relationship.

Another side note, we’ve been pretty touchy the last few times we’ve seen each other, so it’s not like this uncomfortable situation where either of us seem desperate, no kissing or anything but we are very comfortable with each other. I’m planning on seeing her sometime this week but I don’t want to just keep going to her place of work, I’m also waiting on the right time to initiate a meetup but with these circumstances, it’s a little difficult.

Tl;dr: girl that seems interested in me keeps vanishing whenever I text back, but she’s the one who initiates conversation.",0,1767591854.0,relationships,3,0.5,False

So my friend Becca (29F) called me yesterday in a total panic. For context her and I (30F) have been friends since college but we're not like best friends or anything. We hangout maybe once a month grab coffee or whatever.

Anyway she calls me and says ""if my husband asks, I was with you all weekend at a spa retreat upstate okay?"" I was confused and said what are you talking about. She explains that she told her husband Dan she was going to a spa weekend with me but she actually went somewhere else and now Dan is asking questions.

I asked where she actually was and she got all defensive saying ""it doesn't matter just please back me up if he calls you."" Red flags immediately. I said I'm not comfortable lying to her husband about her whereabouts that seems really serious. She started begging saying please its not what I think and she just needs me to do this one favor.

I straight up asked if she was cheating and she got quiet and then said ""I'm not having this conversation with you right now, are you going to help me or not?"" I said no I'm not going to lie for you especially about something like this. She called me a bad friend and hung up.

Well Dan DID call me that evening. Asked if Becca and I went to a spa. I told him the truth - that I haven't seen Becca in about three weeks and I don't know anything about a spa weekend. He thanked me and hung up sounding really upset.

Becca sent me a long nasty text calling me a snitch and saying I ruined her marriage and that I should of just kept my mouth shut. Now some of our mutual friends are split on whether I did the right thing or not.",81,1767591680.0,TwoHotTakes,42,0.91,False

I just need to vent.  Not really sure how to even condense this so bare with me, please.

Some background info: I'm 27 and he is 36 - I was 22 when we started dating and he had just turned 31. We have two kids together, but three at home total. I had one child before my bf and he had two children before me with two different women, but his kids live in other states and we don't see them, nor does he have contact with his oldest (his kid's mom blocked my ""partner"" and his entire family years ago) We have been together for 5 years - living together for over 4 years. He lived a state away and moved to my state/city when I found out I was pregnant. That was the first time I ever lived on my own let alone with somebody else as I lived at my mom's with my oldest while I went to school and worked part-time. I had my oldest at 18. Now we moved back to his home state/city and rent a house that his parent's bought for us to live in.

Ok, now onto the hardships and stories...

Our relationship has always been rocky and I've always struggled with trust issues well before he moved to my city. His friend group had always been problematic. He went out all time and didn't have a job. He was 31 with friends closer to my age or even in college and would frequent college bars every time they went out. That should've been my first red flag. He does have friends his age but they moved out of state and started their own lives. He lived with a roommate that to this day has no job other than dealing I guess.

After moving to my hometown and getting a place together he spent 90% of his time on his phone, watching sports or youtube, or playing COD/warzone with his friends and talking to his friends all night. He would play for for 8-12 hours a day. The  3.5 years he lived there he had about six different jobs, the last job being one my dad had gotten him which he did stay with for over a year. Anyway, our oldest together was born after three months of us living together. The first five months of our her life, her and I slept on the couch because he would get frustrated with her waking up so often when he had to work.

When we first got our place, he was jobless and I took out student loans to pay deposit, first months, and the first few months. Fast forward nine months we moved to a new, better apartment, he was starting another new job so again I used student loans to pay deposit and first two months. I got a part-time job and contributed. Again, same story, he just wasn't a present parent or partner. His priority was a screen and talking to his friends. He never took the kids to do anything nor would he want to do anything as a family. Every time he went back home he would go out with friends. Fast forward to our daughter being 1.5 we decided we shouldn't be together and I found out he had cheated two months into our relationship at the beginning. He moved back and stayed with his friend but a month later we decided we could give it another shot as he promised all of these changes. A month after that I found out I was pregnant with our second. After our second was born (at 2am), he went home at 7am (I still haven't slept while he napped at the hospital) and he left me at the hospital 5 hours postpartum and was gone for 2+ hours (who knows how much longer if I wasn't blowing up his phone). He went home and showered and watched Youtube while drinking coffee and whatever else he did. About a month later the night before mother's day, he tried to leave me and go back home so he could go out with friends and leave me with the kids. After pleading, he stayed but went back the following weekend.

A few months go by and I went on his phone after he got home from work and went to shower. His most recent app open was the app store and pulled up was an lgbtq app ""Taimi"". I re-downloaded it and put in his credentials, and low and behold he had an account. He said he forgot the app was on his phone and he went and deleted it, but that doesn't explain why he had it open on the app store, right? Before I asked him about the app, I also downloaded grindr and saw he had an account on there too but it was older pictures. His bio talked about looking for nice butt bottoms. Those accts were made with yahoo emails, and for some reason I thought of trying his apple id login too and he had accounts with his icloud email as well, so he had two accounts per app. He told me he just wanted to see what they were about and if trans women actually looked good???? I also went to his files app and saw that he had a deleted file that linked to a video on a g@y corn site. Earlier in the year, his google acct was logged in on my laptop and I saw his google search history of g@y corn sites specifically looking up big booty [tr@ns](mailto:tr@ns). He denied everything and ofc i gave him the benefit of the doubt both times. We moved on, but I've never really been able to shake the thought.

December of 2024 came and we still aren't getting along, he called me out of my name and that was it, I was done. He still lived in the apartment, as he was the one paying for it bc I was only working part time. He moved out at the end of February 2025 and into his parents house to care for their home as they moved across the country for a job. He and I both paid the rent while he was gone, come May 2025 he's begging to get back together and he was going to change and all this BS. I caved and thought well it would be good financially, the kids would get to see their dad, I get some help and whatever. This time he wanted us to move to his state. I agreed and thought we were turning a new leaf.... so we started planning, then July came and his parents bought a second house for us to rent from them, and then August came an me I packed the whole apartment up myself and moved myself + three kids into the house.

Recently, one weekend I took the kids and myself back home to visit my family. I set up the camera in the living room and on Saturday night/Sunday morning at 2:30 AM he broke the camera. That following monday I had seen something about another person that prompted me to just check his laptop. His search history shocked me. Earlier in the year he had another search about tr@ns women and lqbtq sites.. but this time over the weekend was much worse. I saw him searching stuff about dogs and women. Women getting ... by dogs. I took pictures and video of the extensive search for proof. He told me it was a fb thing where this lady was talking about how people were freaking out that she did that and he said he was trying to find the whole story. I do not believe him.... it just doesn't add up. I'm going to leave and move back home but I've been stuck and I'm trying to create my exit plan. We just established care here and transferred schools... I have no job and no support. I have no friends or family here and his parents are out of state working. How do I even leave when my family is in another state  and I don't have any income??? Anyway, he has been sleeping in the basement ever since and contact is minimal and he is never alone with our kids and I will never allow for that.

I feel guilty for staying as long  as I have and part of me is feeling guilty for planning this leave because my kids love their dad... they love this house and having their own rooms and so much space, they love having a fenced in yard to run around in. I fear how they'll feel moving into an apartment.. and having to share bedrooms. I also feel guilty because right now there hasn't been arguing so how do I just get up and leave after some time has passed. I know, I know that leaving is the best and safest things to do and I'm doing it. I'm just trying to figure out how. I'm scared of the what ifs. What if I don't find a good job, what if I can't pay my bills, what if I can't pay my debt, what if I can't give my kids a good life? Right now, I have a cushion. I'm scared to fail.

Also adding, MY oldest has learning and behavioral disabilities and ASD.. and has never been treated fairly. He says my oldest is fully capable of understanding and doing right, and he treats my child as if they function as a neurologically normal child. It seems like he resents my child and me most of the time. He never makes time for my child when all my child wants is his attention.

These last few years I've been brain washed and made small by a narcissist. I just want to be in my own space, find myself again, and be a better parent to my kids. I want to be happy again. I want to become me. My entire 20's has been made small and I've been in survival mode. I'm tired of surviving.. I want to breathe and live again.",2,1767591354.0,NarcissisticSpouses,1,1.0,False
1q4dahg,https://www.reddit.com/r/jlpt/comments/1q4dahg/things_worth_knowing_the_night_before_jlpt_test/,Things Worth Knowing the Night Before JLPT Test,"It's JLPT the next day, too late to learn another 100 kanjis or do another 3 mock tests.  But there are still things you should know that would be *critical* to improve your test score, even on the night before.

# 1. Stay Alive!

I mean...do not get yourself disqualified.  The night before, read ""Testing Rules"" at least three times.  No joke.

Remember to **turn off all alarms** and then **power off** your phone during the test as instructed by the proctor.  Many modern phones will wake up in order to sound an alarm, which means instant disqualification.  Don't just put your phone in Airplane/Silent Mode - it is rumored that during one incident alarm was played and the proctors were unable to identify the phone before it ended, so they ended up ordering everyone to open their envelope and disqualifying anyone whose phone is powered on.

Once your phone is sealed inside the envelope, don't open it until after you finish the entire test and **leave the classroom**.  Just handed in your answer sheet and time to celebrate by taking your phone out right away?  You'll cry when the proctor comes to check the seal of your envelope.  There is a real risk of getting disqualified even after *you think* the test is over.

# 2. Strategically Hydrate Yourself

**Do not drink (too much) before the test** as the first section is usually long (2 hours for N1).  I would strongly recommend you avoid coffee and tea to minimize restroom risk.

However, **during the break you should quickly feed your tired brain and prepare it for the intensive listening comprehension**.  To me the best options are sugary drink (I had apple juice), or sweetened coffee.  Since listening section is only 1 hour long, you won't have any restroom risk as long as you relieve yourself during the break and not over-drink.  You will likely have trouble focusing during listening section if you don't replenish your brain power during break.

# 3. Bring an Analog Watch

Yes, **analog means those watches with two or three hands going round and round** that no modern human beings would be using anymore /s.  You risk getting yourself disqualified even if it's just an LCD watch (yes I know those are dumb, but they violate JLPT's written rule).

95% of the test locations (?) have a wall clock.  But you never know if you are in one of the 5% rooms.  I've heard that some test locations had wall clocks, but the organizers had them covered during the test!

# 4. Order and Pace Your Test Strategically

A majority of test takes will have trouble finishing the entire paper within the time limit.  So it is very important to:

1. Finish vocabulary questions as fast as you can.  If you don't know the meaning of a word, you have almost no chance of outdoing a random guess.  So just guess quickly.  Don't waste time by ""throwing a dice inside your head hundreds of times"".
2. For reading comprehension,  **make sure to finish the last problem (information extraction) first**!  It is almost guaranteed to be the easiest problem.

1q4d3kp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q4d3kp/i_work_at_a_diner_in_the_middle_of_nowhere/,I work at a diner in the middle of nowhere,"I’m writing this while yesterday is still clear in my head, because that day was a pretty good example of what working at the diner is actually like. Not the worst day. Not the strangest. Just normal.

A little context might be helpful. The diner sits in the middle of nowhere. One road in, one road out. No streetlights. Cell service comes and goes depending on the weather. Most of the customers only show up because something else has already gone wrong. A missed exit. A breakdown. A GPS that stopped working.

The sign out front says EAT, and the A flickers constantly. We’ve already replaced the wiring twice. Yesterday, like always, it still flickered. Marlene said it liked attention. She says stuff like that a lot.

I clocked in around noon. Poured coffee. Wiped the counter. Followed the same rules I’d learned early on and didn’t think about anymore.

Don’t sit in Booth Six on Sundays.

Don’t clean under the back table.

Don’t argue with the phone.

I took the trash out in the afternoon and saw the rats behind the building. They were already there, scattered around the garden. They never moved together. No packs. No patterns. One ran straight through the dirt, another froze in the open like it had forgotten how legs worked, another climbed the fence and sat there watching the back door.

They went wherever they wanted, but they always stayed between the garden and the diner.

The gnomes were there too.

Marlene kept a small garden out back. Tomatoes that never quite ripened. Herbs that smelled wrong. Yesterday there were nine garden gnomes standing in it. Old ones. Chipped. Sun-faded. All different styles, like they’d been collected over time instead of bought as a set.

They were lined up neatly. Even spacing. Straight rows.

Every single one of them faced the back door.

I stood there for a minute, mostly counting them. They didn’t move. They never did if anyone was watching. I already knew that, so I went back inside to grab a cup of coffee. When I came back out, one of them was closer to the door. Another had turned slightly, like it was correcting its angle.

The rats didn’t react. They ran through the line of gnomes, bumped into them, climbed over them without any urgency. They never attacked them. They just didn’t move out of the way. By the time I went back inside, the rats had settled in front of the gnomes in their usual messy way.

When I checked again later, three of the gnomes had fallen. One was cracked clean in half. None of them were any closer to the door.

I mentioned to Marlene that the gnomes kept tipping over and asked if she wanted me to move them farther back.

She didn’t look up from the register. “Don’t interfere,” she said. “They’re not supposed to get in.”

The payphone rang during the dinner rush.

It was mounted between the bathrooms, still working, despite having to be at least thirty years old. I picked it up without thinking. The breathing was already there. Same as usual. A man, close to the receiver, slow and steady.

I waited. It had become habit at this point.

Luckily, Marlene came over and dropped coins into my hand. Two quarters, a dime, and three pennies.

“He wants sixty-three cents,” she said.

I fed the coins into the phone while the breathing continued. When the last penny dropped, the line went quiet.

“Thank you,” the man said, polite and relieved.

That was it. I hung up and went back to refilling coffee.

When my shift ended, there was a small package on the counter. Brown paper. Twine. No name. Inside was a replacement phone charger. The same kind I’d mentioned losing earlier that day.

The rest of the day stayed uneventful in the way it always is. The coffee pot refused to brew until I apologized to it. A customer tried to sit in Booth Six and left looking pale and crying. And a car pulled into the parking spot under the flickering A and vanished.

Marlene comped the meal and laid bus tickets on their table before the driver even noticed.

Nothing bad happened yesterday. That’s the part that always sounds like a lie when I say it out loud.

1q4cxy8,https://i.redd.it/yn5owustsgbg1.png,"Werewolf, Wine, And My Billion-Dollar Revenge","On Christmas Eve, my boyfriend, Miles Peyton, told me his group was short one player for a round of Werewolf and asked me to fill in.





We’d been together for three years, yet this was the first time he ever brought me into his circle of friends. I even studied the rules in advance.





When the moderator announced, “It’s night. Everybody close your eyes. Werewolves, you may open your eyes.”





I shut my eyes. A moment later, I heard the faint rustle of clothing beside me. Then came a softer sound—wet, subtle, unmistakably intimate.





It came from the direction where my boyfriend and his childhood friend, Sabrina Hayes, were seated.





The sticky, ambiguous noise made something pull tight inside my chest. But the rules said to keep my eyes shut, so I forced myself to ignore the twist in my gut.





When the moderator spoke again, “Witch, you may open your eyes.” I lifted my lids, adjusting to the returning light.





Instinctively, my gaze moved first to Miles There was a smear of glossy red at the corner of his mouth—too bright, too slick, nothing like his actual lip color.





My eyes shifted to the girl on his other side. Sabrina’s lips, usually neat and full, had a ring of cherry-red lipstick smudged around the edges. The color matched the mark on Miles perfectly.





\*\*\*





I curled my fingers into my palm and swallowed the words that almost slipped out.





Maybe it was accidental. Maybe they bumped into each other. I told myself that, refusing to ruin my first time meeting his friends.





The moderator continued, “Witch, this player died tonight. Do you want to save her?” He pointed at me. After a brief pause, I chose to use the antidote on myself.





The game moved into the daytime round. The moderator rang the little bell on the table. “Morning, everyone. Last night was Christmas Eve.”





Sabrina froze slightly. Her gaze flicked toward me, a flash of open disappointment and surprise in her eyes. As if I should have been eliminated on the first night.





The moderator went on, “We’ll speak in order. Miss Hayes, you start.”





Remembering the noises I heard while my eyes were closed, I kept my tone steady. “I think the werewolves are Miles and Sabrina.”





“When my eyes were shut earlier, there were unusual sounds to my left, coming from where the two of them were seated.”





My words had barely landed when a sharp, mocking laugh cut through the air. It came from Logan Reed, Miles’s longtime buddy.





“Miles, does your girl even know how to play?”





“Werewolf is about logic. Since when do outside noises count as evidence?”





“If we’re going by that, my ears are sharp too. I heard her breathing get all heavy. Should I call her a werewolf for that?”





“Yeah, if you can’t handle the game, don’t ruin it for everyone.”





“Rules are rules. Don’t talk nonsense.”





A few others echoed him with casual, thoughtless agreement.





I tried to explain, but Miles suddenly pressed down on my wrist. His palm was warm through my sleeve, yet his voice sided completely with his friends. “They’re right. Werewolf has its own rules.”





“You can learn as you go, but don’t bring in things that aren’t part of the game. It throws everyone off.”





My lips parted, but the words stuck in my throat.





A memory surfaced—back when Miles and I first started dating, I once got into an argument with someone over something small. Miles hadn’t even asked what happened before stepping in front of me, shielding me. “I don’t care who’s right. She’s my girlfriend. I stand with her.”





His voice was still ringing in my ears, every word searing into my heart.





Now he wouldn’t even spare me a single chance to explain. It felt like a handful of fine needles pressing into my chest, a tight, bitter ache spreading outward.





I said nothing more and lowered my gaze.





The atmosphere grew awkward. The moderator moved on to the voting phase.





There was almost no suspense. Everyone raised their hand to vote me out—including Miles.





I became the first “dead” player of the night.





In the following rounds, everything repeated like some absurd loop. No matter what role I drew—villager, werewolf, or witch—I was voted out on the very first day.





The reasons varied but always sounded the same: My speech was weak, my expression suspicious, my logic flawed. Sometimes they didn’t even need a reason. All it took was someone casually saying, “I think she seems a little suspicious,” and everyone else would chime in like that was all the proof they needed.





Under such blatant targeting, I finally saw the truth. This wasn’t a game. It was a deliberate hazing ritual, wrapped neatly in the rules of Werewolf.





And Miles? Every time I was “killed,” he would give my hand a small reassuring pat… then turn right back to sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with Sabrina, whispering strategies with her.





When she made a correct guess, he affectionately tousled her hair. When she was “killed,” he sighed dramatically and comforted her.





Logan chimed in loudly, “Miles, with the chemistry you and Sabrina have, people might mistake you two for a couple!”





Miles laughed and told him to get lost, but he didn’t deny it.





Someone next to me tried to smooth things over with a smile. “They grew up together. They’ve always been like this. Don’t take it to heart, Chloe.”





I curved my lips politely and said nothing. Take it to heart? On what grounds?





A simple “they grew up together” was supposed to shut down everything I felt. If I got upset, I’d look like I had no sense of humor.





When the moderator announced yet another unanimous vote against me, I didn’t sit in silence waiting for the round to end.





Instead, I lifted my head, looked around the circle, and smiled. “Playing like this over and over is starting to feel a little boring.”





The chatter in the living room quieted. A few pairs of eyes landed on me.





Meeting those curious, amused, or surprised gazes, I kept my tone light. “Why don’t we make this interesting? Add a little bet?”





I slipped off the diamond-studded bracelet Miles had given me and set it on the coffee table with a crisp sound. “I’ll go first. Next round, I’m betting this.”



Chapter 2

The bracelet was the newest limited-edition release from a luxury brand, priced well into seven figures. It was also the gift Miles gave me for our third anniversary.





We both knew I had hoped for a ring—even a modest one—yet he chose a bracelet instead.





Now, watching it sit on the table as my wager, his expression visibly darkened. His brows drew together, and he shot me a warning look.





Sabrina Hayes paused, then picked up the bracelet and weighed it lightly in her palm. She let out a sweet, airy laugh. “Since Chloe wants to play, of course we’ll play along. But…”





Her tone shifted. She lifted her eyes toward me, her smile carrying a sharpness just beneath the sugar. “Just don’t start crying halfway through and claim we ganged up on you when you lose. That would be so embarrassing.”





I smiled and nodded. “Naturally.”





“But since this is Werewolf, the outcome depends on the team.”





The moment the words left my mouth, the atmosphere around the table tightened. The easy, unspoken unity they shared—always pointing their spears outward—paused for just a beat.





People exchanged glances. Something shifted in their eyes.





Because now, with real stakes on the line, it wasn’t just a game anymore. If someone ended up on my team and eliminated me like before, they would be tanking their own chances of winning.





Sabrina’s smile faltered a little, though she still reached up and unclasped the necklace around her neck. She set it beside the bracelet.





Hanging from the chain was a pear-shaped diamond pendant, shimmering under the light, its value obvious at a single glance.





Sabrina stroked the pendant with a soft, deliberate touch. Her voice came out sweet and coaxing.



“I’m betting this. Someone gave it to me last month, so don’t let me lose it.”





As she spoke, her gaze drifted meaningfully toward Miles.





The table fell into silence. Every eye shifted between her necklace and the bracelet I had placed down.





Anyone with half a brain could see it—the pieces were part of the same collection. And necklaces from this brand were always several times the price of the bracelet.





My stomach dropped, as if struck by something blunt.





The gift for our third anniversary wasn’t just part of a matching set with his childhood friend’s jewelry—hers was the more expensive one.





Miles’s expression grew even darker. His lips pressed into a thin, tight line. He didn’t look at Sabrina, nor at me. Instead, he quietly removed the watch from his wrist and placed it on the table.





A deeper ache spread through my chest. That watch was the gift I gave him when we first started dating. It wasn’t expensive, but he had worn it every day, saying it was the first thing I ever gave him and meant more than any luxury brand.





Seeing it thrown into the pile felt like something warm had been quietly crushed.





The others followed suit, taking off rings, bracelets, even car keys, forming a small, scattered heap.





The next round of the game began quickly.





Perhaps because of the stakes, the atmosphere had clearly changed. No one openly mocked me anymore. Everyone’s speeches became sharper, more calculated.





I drew the role of werewolf, but a glaring mistake on my part gave me away. I was voted out in the daytime round.





My teammates immediately turned on me.





“If you don’t know how to play, stop trying to lead. Who told you to add a bet? Great job messing this up!”





“Seriously. You’re the one jealous and trying to prove a point. Don’t drag us down with you.”





“If we’d known, we should’ve voted you out in the first round. Unbelievable.”





Miles and Sabrina were on the other team. They won effortlessly.



Chapter 3

She gathered the wagers on the table with a bright, triumphant smile.





She picked up my bracelet, lifted it to the light with an admiring look, then held up her own necklace. “Thanks, Chloe. Now my necklace and the bracelet are finally a matching pair.”





Among the wagers from the last round, there had also been a men’s watch.





Sabrina picked it up, then naturally reached for Miles Peyton’s hand and fastened it onto his wrist. “The old one you wore was getting too dated. Time to upgrade.”





“Out with the old, in with the new. And this one looks perfect on you.”





Laughter filled the room, teasing and suggestive, as the second round began.





I placed the crocodile leather clutch I had brought onto the table.





Sabrina’s eyes lit up. “Well, aren’t you generous? I’ve liked this design for ages, but it’s sold out everywhere.”





I only smiled. The moderator had already started dealing the cards.





This time, I drew the werewolf again—and, surprisingly, Miles ended up on my team.





But even as my teammate, Miles repeatedly steered the discussion toward me during the speaking phase. He practically handed them my identity on a silver platter.





In the end, our team lost again without suspense.





Hearing the moderator announce the result, a burn rose in my throat. I nearly broke down right there.





Just because Sabrina said she liked the clutch—just one sentence—Miles was willing to sabotage his own team in front of everyone, showing no regard for my dignity as his actual girlfriend.





How ridiculous. I had looked forward to this gathering for weeks, planned everything carefully, only to end up humiliated in the barest, cruelest way.





Miles didn’t notice how red my eyes were. He was too busy passing the clutch to Sabrina.





His voice held a faint, eager-to-please note. “Here, won it for you.”





“You’ve been whining about this bag for weeks. You happy now?”





Sabrina immediately jumped up, wrapped her arms around his neck, and rubbed her cheek affectionately against his. “You’re the best, Miles!”





Then, as if suddenly remembering my presence, she let go and stuck out her tongue apologetically. “Don’t mind me, Chloe. I’ve thanked Miles like this since I was little. It’s just a habit.”





It felt like my chest had been soaked in lemon juice, tight and aching.





But on the surface, I remained calm and composed. I shook my head to show she didn’t need to worry.





Somehow, that gesture triggered something in Miles. He shoved Sabrina’s hand off his shoulder with a dark expression and snapped, “Enough. Keep going.”





The next few rounds blurred together. I lost far more than I won.





Piece by piece—my necklace, my earrings, my rings—every accessory I wore was stripped from me and became part of the pile in front of Sabrina.





On the rare rounds where Miles and I ended up on the same team, he still made “careless” mistakes at key moments, mistakes that conveniently tilted the advantage toward Sabrina’s side.





The heap of jewelry in front of Sabrina grew higher, and her smile grew brighter.





My side of the table was nearly empty.





She toyed with the jewelry she had won and spoke in a lightly mocking tone. “Chloe, looks like you’ve almost run out. What else can you bet?”





“Why don’t we call it a night while you’re still ahead?”





Low, knowing snickers rose around the table.





I lifted my gaze and smiled as if nothing touched me. “Of course we’re continuing.”





“I don’t have much left on me, but I do have something else.”





Her brows drew together slightly as I met her eyes and spoke evenly.





“I’ll wager the house at Southview Gardens, Villa No. 9.”





The room fell into instant silence.





Villa No. 9 of Southview Gardens was my parents’ marital home. Beyond the memories it carried, it was worth over a hundred million.





Whispers burst loose around the room, sharp and sudden as grease spitting in a hot pan.





“Holy shit… is she insane? Betting something that big?”





“That’s the house her parents left her and she’s throwing it into a game?”





“She’s completely gone love-drunk. Just to go head-to-head with Sabrina, she’d even gamble that?”





“If she were my daughter, I’d claw my way out of my grave just to slap her.”





“Who’d even dare end up on her team? If she loses this…”





Mockery rippled through the room.





Miles slammed his palm on the table and shouted, “Enough! Chloe Lawson, do you even know what you’re saying?”





I ignored him. My gaze stayed fixed on Sabrina. “Do you dare to play?”",2,1767590100.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,2,1.0,False
1q4cvtm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q4cvtm,OP travelled in train for the first time in life :),"I’ve been to a few hill stations by my own car but I used to get tired by driving the car for 8-10 hours straight so this time I decided to go by flight and come back by train. 

I took flight from Delhi to Udaipur on 1st jan with air India express it costed 3400 per person 

And came back on 4th jan Udaipur to Delhi via raj humsafar express it costed me about 1200 per person for 3A ac.

The train left the station exactly on time at 12:50 AM, which honestly surprised me.

I booked the ticket just a few days before departure, I got an upper berth since the lower ones were already taken. I wasn’t sure what to expect, but it turned out to be quite comfortable. I slept for most of the journey, which I didn’t expect on my first train ride.

Food was provided by the IRCTC staff. It was actually decent and hygienic, better than what I was expecting. The only downside was that from around 7 AM, the IRCTC people started moving around shouting “chai, coffee, breakfast” pretty loudly. They kept roaming through the coaches serving food, and it honestly felt a bit like a local market and waking me up from deep sleep.

Not sure if this is normal, but does this happen in 2A as well, or is it mostly a 3A/Sleeper thing?

Overall though, the experience felt calm and different.

Didn’t expect this, but I’ve actually developed a bit of interest in trains now. Feels like something I missed out on for a long time.

Can you recommend me scenic route or maybe a better train that can try from Delhi?",0,1767589924.0,india_tourism,6,0.4,False

1q4ctz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/christiandatingadvice/comments/1q4ctz7/incredibly_insane_story_and_need_advice_plainly/,incredibly insane story and need advice plainly,"hello, so i’m dating a young man and he’s a christian. has been for about 10-12yrs now. his dad is a pastor and so is his mom. i have been saved for 3yrs now and officially surrendered my life to Christ about 2.5yrs ago. right after surrendering my life, so much has changed. this is about to get oddly specific so please don’t judge me if you know this story personally, idk who else to reach out to atp. 

so, shortly after surrendering my life to Jesus, i made a sticky note prayer that said “i would have a love like that of Song of Solomon and that my husband would God more than anything else”. i also took note that it said “do not awaken love before it’s time”. so i waited patiently and didn’t pray with intent to meet my husband, i just wanted to earnestly pray for him even though i didn’t know him yet. i let it go down the river and forgot about it. 

well, 2 weeks later a mutual friend from church reached out and said that she knew someone who seemed to like me. we exchanged numbers and quickly became friends. i was extremely nervous as he is my pastor’s son and i was just recently transformed by God. i put my trust and faith into God and didn’t awaken love before it’s time.

we hungout with friends the first two times we met, and saw lots of each other in groups at church in between. then we went on an actual first date. it was to a coffee shop and thrifting. we sat down with our coffee and there was instant peace. no trying to impress each other, or butterflies, or even tension. we were just friends and starting to develop feelings. it was so sweet. we talked about music and Jesus alot, we also shared some memes. 

i will brush over this briefly. 

things started to go downhill.

i lost my brother to cancer right after we started to hangout. he was there for me, but there was no emotional support or depth. so i started to look for it in other ways. long story short, we fell into lust. he asked me to be his girlfriend because we kissed for 3hrs straight and i told him friends don’t kiss. 

2yrs of a painful, ridiculous cycle. as soon as it happened i was in instant shame. i was also confused. my last relationship was like this but i was naive and backslid. i thought it was somehow ok because i was “submitting” and forgiving him. that’s what God would’ve wanted, to love him thru sin. but i simultaneously hated myself and wanted help.

we got help, but not from my choice of people. i wanted to ask the young couple who just recently got married and did it the right way. the wife has known me since i was a kid and the husband has known him since he was a kid. he refused. he didn’t want his reputation tarnished. he wanted his mentor and his wife to disciple us. they are strong leaders and the wife leads a girls life group at our church. she’s helped many young adult girls into womanhood. the problem is i didn’t know either of them and they didn’t know me. they’ve known my bf since he was like 8. it was an unfair advantage. 

i poured out my soul to the woman and nothing has helped or changed since then. they don’t even ask for accountability anymore. i mean it’s bad. the husband told my bf to build his own life. at this point we were a year into dating and he was telling him to do things on his own and away from us as a couple. i mean straight up word for word. the wife told me i shouldn’t look for comfort in a man. she also told me he’s an artist ofc he’s gonna be visually inclined. 

porn. he had a porn addiction. he never told me. i never suspected it until i asked him why he is so obsessed with sex. he lied to me from the start. i asked him if there was any habitual sin he struggled with and he said no. then later told me he watched porn and imagined my face on it. 

since then he stopped. he stopped masterbating. but i’ve had dreams he cheats on me. 3 separate times. it’s usually that someone cooler and more fun comes along and steals him away. basically someone promiscuous and he just laughs at me and goes along with it. but that’s just a dream. 

anyways my dad went to jail last december. my mom cheated on my stepdad and left him for her ex who now lives in florida. so i live with his sister. we got an apartment in their parents complex. so i live close to him, with his family, go to his family’s church, and constantly support him. 

this was my winter break dec 12-jan 18 and i havent got to see much of him since i went back to school this fall which he has been so unsupportive of. barely visits, barely encourages, no gifts, flowers, nothing. just wants a gf with all the benefits and no efforts. HE SCHEDULED A TRIP TO JAPAN. we did a christmas show up until christmas week and then it was new years and then he had a gig that i went to and showed up for and now he’s leaving for japan. i mean how selfish can this man get!???

he’s the worst. and idk what to do or how to pray for him anymore. i used to be praying on my knees for him and i but that doesn’t seem to work either. and everyone says he’s such a good guy. idk what to do or who to get help from. i’m just sad. i feel used and i barely had anything to give in the first place.

what do i do? any advice? or words of encouragement?",2,1767589777.0,christiandatingadvice,12,1.0,False
1q4ctr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductNew/comments/1q4ctr2/how_to_choose_smart_plugs_for_large_families/,How to choose smart plugs for large families?,"When you have a large family, managing electricity usage becomes a real challenge. Smart plugs can help you control multiple devices, save money on energy bills, and make your home more efficient.

**What Makes Smart Plugs Perfect for Big Families**

Smart plugs let you control any device remotely through your phone. You can turn off forgotten lights, schedule appliances to run during cheaper energy hours, and monitor which devices use the most power. For families with kids who forget to unplug chargers or turn off gaming systems, these devices are game-changers.

**Key Features to Look For**

**Energy Monitoring**: Choose smart plugs that track power consumption. This helps you identify which devices cost the most to run and adjust usage accordingly.

**Scheduling Functions**: Look for plugs that let you set timers and schedules. You can automatically turn off electronics during bedtime or when everyone's at school and work.

**Voice Control**: Pick models that work with Alexa, Google Home, or Siri. This makes it easy for everyone in the family to control devices without finding their phone.

**App Control**: Make sure the smart plug connects to a user-friendly app that multiple family members can access.

**How Many Smart Plugs Do You Need?**

Large families typically need 8-12 smart plugs to cover essential areas. Focus on high-energy devices like TVs, gaming consoles, coffee makers, and phone chargers. Don't forget outdoor areas if you have patio lights or pool equipment.

**Installation and Setup Tips**

Most smart plugs work right out of the box. You just plug them into your wall outlet, download the app, and connect to your WiFi network. The whole process usually takes less than 5 minutes per plug.

**Budget Considerations**

Smart plugs range from $10-30 each. For large families, buying multipacks often saves money. You can find quality options that won't break the budget while still offering all the features you need. Check out some highly-rated smart plug options [here](https://athomewave.com/smart-plugs) to compare prices and features.

**Safety for Families with Children**

Choose smart plugs with child-safe designs and tamper-resistant features. Some models include safety shutoffs that prevent overheating, which is important when managing multiple devices throughout your home.

**Getting Started**

Start with smart plugs in your most-used rooms like the living room and kitchen. Once your family gets comfortable with the technology, you can expand to bedrooms and other areas. Many families see a 10-15% reduction in their electricity bills after switching to smart plugs.

[https://youtu.be/MJFGhmTkays](https://youtu.be/MJFGhmTkays)

The morning of May 9 arrived without ceremony.That’s the part that bothers me most, even now. There was nothing special about it. No strange dreams. No storms pressing against the windows. No sense that the day was any different from the hundreds that came before it.Just heat.Early heat, already sitting heavy in the air like it had nowhere else to go. The kind that made the house feel smaller than it was. Ceiling fans hummed in every room, chopping the air into useless pieces, fighting a battle they were never going to win.I remember lying on the living room floor, my cheek pressed against the cool patch beneath the coffee table, tightening the strap on my backpack again even though I’d already done it twice. The fabric was worn thin where my fingers kept pulling at it. I didn’t need anything in the bag that badly. I just needed something to do with my hands.Charlotte leaned against my shoulder, quiet in the way she got when places felt wrong. Her fingers were curled into my sleeve, not tight enough to hurt, but firm. Anchoring herself.She didn’t say anything. She rarely did unless she had to.Mom moved through the room barefoot, stepping around open suitcases, folding clothes with quick, practiced motions. She’d packed and unpacked most of her life. Moving jobs. Moving apartments. Adjusting. She was good at it. Too good. You get good at things you don’t expect to last.Dad noticed the silence first.I didn’t understand that at the time. I just saw him pause with a shirt halfway folded in his hands, his eyes unfocusing like he’d heard something no one else had. Later, I’d recognize that look. That moment when the world didn’t quite line up with itself.Not peaceful silence.The other kind.The kind that makes you aware of your own breathing. Of the way your chest rises and falls without asking permission.James stood near the front door.He hadn’t sat down once since I’d woken up.He held his keys in his right hand, fingers clenched so tightly the metal bit into his skin. Every few seconds, he checked his watch. Then the door. Then the hallway that led deeper into the house. Like something might come walking out if he looked away for too long.I remember thinking he looked thinner than the last time I’d seen him. His clothes hung on him wrong, like they belonged to someone else now. There were dark circles under his eyes, deep enough to look permanent.“We should leave today,” James said.His voice cut through the hum of the fans like a blade.Dad didn’t look up. “Tomorrow morning’s fine.”James swallowed. I saw his jaw tighten, muscles jumping beneath the skin.“Today would be better.”Mom glanced over her shoulder, one eyebrow lifting slightly.

“The campsite isn’t going anywhere, James.”He tried to smile then. It didn’t work. It stretched thin across his face, fragile, like it might crack if anyone pushed it too far.Charlotte shifted beside me.“Ja… Ja—” she started.Her breath caught. She hated when everyone turned to look at her. You could see it in the way her shoulders tensed, in the way she leaned just a little closer to me. But she pushed through it anyway, stubborn in her own quiet way.“James… Mr. James…”I squeezed her hand, slow and steady.“…Op—Ophelia?” she finished.The room went still.Not dramatic stillness. No music cutting out. No sudden quiet like in movies.Just a pause so complete it felt deliberate.James froze.For half a second, I thought he might pretend he hadn’t heard her. Pretend the word hadn’t landed where it had. But then he exhaled, long and slow, like he’d been holding his breath since the question existed.“She’s not coming,” he said.His voice was calm.Too calm.Mom frowned gently. “Is she sick?”James nodded once. “Something like that.”Charlotte tilted her head, confused. “Bu—but… she a-always comes.”His fingers tightened around the keys. The metal clinked softly.“Not this time.”No one pushed further.You could feel it—the invisible w

A song you could hum without knowing the words. I bobbed my head to the rhythm, more out of habit than enjoyment. Charlotte sat beside me, knees tucked up, counting trees as they passed.“One… two… th—three…”Her voice snagged on the number. She stopped counting altogether and stared out the window, lips pressed tight.Mom noticed. She always did. “You okay, sweetheart?”Charlotte nodded too quickly.James turned the volume up.Dad watched him from the passenger seat. Every few minutes, James adjusted the rearview mirror—not to check traffic, but to look at us. At me. At Charlotte. Each time, he looked away again just as fast, jaw clenched, like he’d touched something hot.“You sure this is the right way?” Mom asked after a while.James didn’t hesitate. “Yes.”The road narrowed. Asphalt cracked and faded, giving way to gravel that popped beneath the tires. Mom checked her phone, then frowned.“No network,” she said lightly. “Figures.”James didn’t smile.The forest began without warning.One moment there was sky on eith

“What’s its name?”James’s grip tightened.“I don’t know.”It was a lie.Dad closed his eyes. Images pressed against the backs of his eyelids—blurred, incomplete. Blood where there shouldn’t have been blood. Shapes that didn’t make sense until they did. Screams that ended too quickly.“We should turn back,” he said.James shook his head. “No.”“You said it was close.”“It is.”“James.”James’s voice cracked. “I said no.”The car rolled forward, deeper into the trees.Charlotte pressed her face into my shoulder, hiding. I wrapped an arm around her, the excitement I’d felt earlier gone now, replaced with something quieter and sharper.The forest felt closer. Not physically—something else. As if the distance between here and there had folded in on itself.As if we had already crossed a line.Far ahead, between the trees, something pale stood very still.James didn’t slow down.Dad said nothing.Some warnings come too late.The campsite appeared suddenly, as if the forest had decided—at the last possible moment—to allow it.A clea

“Night comes fast here.”“How do you know?” I asked.James didn’t answer.We worked in near silence. Mom laid out food. I helped Dad with the tent. Charlotte stayed close, never letting go of my hand. Every so often, James stopped what he was doing and looked toward the trees, listening.Dad noticed.“What are you waiting for?” he asked.James blinked. “Nothing.”A lie. Again.By late afternoon, the light began to change. Shadows stretched longer than they should have. The trees seemed closer now, their presence pressing in from all sides. Mom tried to lighten the mood, pointing out how cool the air felt, how peaceful it was.No one laughed.Dad walked to the edge of the clearing. The forest began just a few steps away. He stared into it, past the first line of trunks, trying to see how deep it went.The trees swallowed distance.“Albert,” Mom called. “Don’t wander off.”“I won’t,” he said.He didn’t tell her that last time, someone had said the same thing.We lit the campfire as the sun dipped below the trees. Flames cra

Not close enough to point at.Not far enough to pretend it wasn’t real.Heavy.It hit the ground with a dull, wet thud, like something large dropping onto soil that had already been softened by rain. The earth shuddered beneath it, just enough for me to feel it through the thin fabric of the tent floor.Charlotte sat up beside me with a sharp intake of breath.“Leo,” she whispered.Her voice was small. Tight. She already knew.I hadn’t slept. Not really. I’d been lying there listening to the quiet, to the absence of everything that was supposed to be there. Insects. Wind. The distant movement of animals. All of it missing, like the forest had decided to hold its breath.Another sound followed.Slower this time.Dragging.Something scraped against the ground, leaving a noise that made my teeth ache. I could hear it clearly now—not just one movement, but a rhythm. Patient. Deliberate.Dad pushed himself upright in the tent across from ours. I heard the fabric shift, his breath catching as the sound registered.Mom stirred

They didn’t emerge all at once. They simply… appeared. As if they’d been standing there the whole time, waiting for the light to reach them.They were tall.Far too tall.Each one stood easily over seven feet, their bodies stretched wrong, proportions skewed in ways my brain refused to settle into. Where arms should have been, there was nothing. Just smooth, unfinished flesh. Where faces should have been, there were no features at all. No eyes. No mouths.Only legs.Long. Thick. Muscled.And soaked in blood.They stood at the edge of the clearing, unmoving.Waiting.Charlotte screamed.One of the figures tilted its head.Not in curiosity.In recognition.Its leg dragged forward, slow and deliberate, carving a shallow line through the dirt.James sobbed. The sound tore out of him, raw and animal. “Please,” he cried. “I brought her. I did what you wanted. Please.”Dad turned on him. “James… what did you do?”James didn’t look at him. He couldn’t. “I thought…” His voice broke. “I thought it was over.”The second figure stepped

“The car!”The clearing burst back into view just as something slammed into the vehicle.Glass exploded outward in a spray of glittering shards. The windshield caved inward in a single, crushing impact that punched straight through to the back window. Metal screamed as the car rocked violently, then went still.Charlotte screamed into Mom’s shoulder.Something inside me went cold.“No,” Dad whispered. “It’s done.”The figures were closer now. Close enough that I could hear the sound their legs made against the ground—wet, dragging, wrong.Mom turned to Dad.He didn’t need to say anything.She already knew.Mom set Charlotte down gently, hands shaking as she brushed dirt from her knees. She pressed her forehead to Charlotte’s, breathing her in like she was trying to memorize her.“Close your eyes,” she whispered. “Both of you.”“No,” I said, panic ripping through me. “Mom—”She smiled.It was small. Steady. Final.“Take your sister,” she said. “Listen to your father.”Dad grabbed her wrist. “Lily—”“They repeat,” she said sof

Fire.I turned toward it.The car was a ruin. Metal twisted inward like it had been punched by something impossibly strong. Glass covered the ground in dull, broken constellations. Flames licked weakly from beneath the hood, coughing smoke into the trees.Near it, a figure knelt.James.He was [alive.One](http://alive.one/) arm ended at the shoulder, wrapped tight in torn fabric. Blood had soaked through and dried dark against his shirt. His face looked gray, emptied out, his eyes too big in his skull. When he saw us, something in him collapsed.“Leo,” he croaked. “Charlotte.”Charlotte flinched at the sound of his voice and pressed her face harder into my chest.James struggled to his feet, swaying. “They’re gone,” he said. “For now.”I stared past him, searching the tree line. “My mom and dad—”James closed his eyes.“I’m sorry,” he whispered.The forest didn’t answer.James led us away from the clearing, staying close to the road like he was afraid to step too far in either direction. Dawn crept in slowly, a pale, fragile light that felt

At night she dreamed of silence so deep it rang, like pressure building behind her ears. She woke shaking, gasping for air, and James would sit with her until morning without saying a word.I never dreamed.I remembered.Years passed anyway. Life does that, whether you’re ready or not. School. Work. Houses that didn’t feel like homes. Small moments of laughter that arrived unexpectedly and left just as fast, like they weren’t sure they were allowed to stay.Sometimes, when the wind was just right, Charlotte would stop whatever she was doing.Once, years later, she stood at the kitchen sink washing dishes. The window was open just enough to let the evening air in. The scent of pine drifted through the screen, faint but unmistakable.She didn’t turn around.“Th-they’re n-not h-hunting,” she said softly.I nodded from the table. “They repeat.”James heard that once.He paused in the doorway, one hand resting against the frame.

1q4cipb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q4cipb,My top five favorite spots after four nights in Chicago,"I was in the city for 4 nights and wanted to go back to a few spots I enjoyed during my last visit while trying out many new ones so these were my 5 favorite ones this time:

1. Flub a Dub Chub's (Lakeview): I went here during my last trip and had to come back for one reason - their chicken sandwich. Their chicken is perfectly cooked, all of the condiments are very fresh, I like that you can choose between a regular or pretzel bun, and they have a lot of options for tasty sauces, my favorite being their honey mustard. I got both their grilled and fried chicken sandwiches and had three chicken sandwiches from there between two visits this trip. Best chicken sandwich I've ever had. 9.7/10
2. Bruna's Ristorante (Heart of Italy): I wanted to try at least one of Bruna's, Bacchanalia, or Ignotz while visiting and ended up at Bruna's first which was a very wise decision. They get their bread from a local bakery which is some of the best bread I've had in an Italian restaurant and their olive oil and parmesan with it is incredibly good. Their vodka chicken parmesan is also killer with a great vodka sauce, even though I wish it was a bit crispier. I went for a full meal the first time and went back a second time for more bread as well as a tre colori salad and pistachio ice cream since I was a bit disappointed with Bacchanalia which I tried right before lol. The salad wasn't as good as everything else, but that doesn't stop this place from being a must-visit. 9.2/10
3. Redhot Ranch (Armitage location): I went here on a whim since I was let down with the burger I tried at Best Intentions and RHR was just down the street. Even though I was a bit hesitant to go here due to all the hype on this subreddit, I felt like it definitely lived up to it! For my first visit, I got a single smashburger which was very crispy on the edges, well-seasoned, and may have been one of the best cooked burger patties I've ever had. I went back for a double smashburger with fries and extra sauce on the side and even though the burger wasn't as crispy this time, it still tasted very good and I felt like the ratio of meat to ingredients this time was a bit better. The fries were a tad greasy, but still had a pretty good crunch and were well-salted. I know I'm definitely stating the obvious here on this subreddit, but it's pretty insane how good this place is compared to its cost. 9/10
4. La Patisserie P (Little Saigon, Argyle Street): a friend recommended this spot for Euro-Asian pastries and it didn't disappoint! For pastries, I got a spicy Korean pork bun, egg tart, and hopia with mung bean and they were all great, especially the hopia which was very fresh. The pork bun also had lean pieces of pork in it and was better than several spots I tried in NYC, even though it wasn't spicy like it claimed lol. I probably wouldn't get the Vietnamese coffee again as it wasn't very strong, but I'd absolutely come back for the pastries. 8.8/10
5. Pizza Amelia (Roscoe Village): I wanted to try out some NY-style slice shops in Chicago to see how they compare and this spot didn't disappoint! I found out about this spot through this subreddit and it's definitely a hidden gem and very comparable to my favorite spots in NYC. It had a great crisp on the edges, a good balance of ingredients, and it was honestly better than most of the other pizza spots I've had in Chicago lol. I liked it more than Jimmy's which I also tried during this trip. 8.7/10

As I visited during New Year's, unfortunately several spots on my list I wanted to try or go back to were closed so I'll definitely hit these ones up during my next visit! Spots I wanted to go to:

* Leavitt Street Tavern (I went here last time which I really liked)
* Black Dog Gelato (I went here last time which I really liked)
* Marz Community Brewing
* Budacki's Drive In
* Asian Cuisine Express
* The Duck Inn",9,1767588860.0,chicagofood,8,0.76,False
1q4ci07,https://i.redd.it/fxb0dxtyogbg1.png,Nut for the Nuts Machine,"Warning, Partial AI Post Ahead

Nuts for the  Nut Machine (Yes, That’s a Thing Now).  
  
Okay, so this is going to sound weird, but I got \*way\* too excited about a vending machine today in DEN Airport.  
  
Hear me out.    
  
This wasn’t just any vending machine. It was a genuinely \*good\* one—like, the kind of vending machine that makes you stop mid-stride in an airport and whisper, “Well hello there, snack daddy.”    
  
Before you judge me (fair), this particular machine was stocked with \*\*nuts\*\*. Which, if you’ve ever flown through an airport at 3 a.m. on nothing but coffee fumes and regret, you already know is basically air travel gold. Protein! Portability! The illusion that you’re making healthy choices while sitting in a flying sardine can!    
  
The Art of the Well-Placed Machine    
  
So the folks at \*\*Garrett\*\* wanted to push their nut brand, which, honestly, is a strong life choice. They went with a Chinese-built unit—no elevator, nice and straightforward. (Because if you need an elevator for your peanuts, you might be overcomplicating your snack strategy.)    
  
There’s also this delightful signage on the glass calling out the drop sensor. This is genius, by the way. Apparently, people get weirdly anxious about buying heavier or more expensive things from vending machines. Like we all carry a deep generational trauma about getting our snacks stuck in the coil of despair. So, the machine politely reassures you: \*Don’t worry, your almonds will fall. Probably.\*    
  
Tablet Advertising and Dreams Deferred    
  
Now, it also has a fancy advertising tablet—except it wasn’t showing anything at the time. Empty, hopeful screen. Just waiting for its big break. I felt that. Same energy as my brain after three layovers.    
  
(But seriously, smart setup. Airport advertising is prime real estate. You’ve got tired, hungry people staring at walls for hours. Give them something shiny to look at besides gate B17’s sad carpeting.)    
  
Wheels, Toppers, and Mobile Snack Glory    
  
The machine even has castors/wheels, which means Garrett can move it around the airport like a snack cart ninja, striking fear into the overpriced kiosk vendors and delight into the hearts of weary travelers. There’s also a topper—a little extra flair up top to help it stand taller, prouder, and possibly judge you for ordering trail mix instead of cashews.    
  
If you want something like this—a custom vending setup- that’s actually smart, stylish, and mildly life-changing—shoot us a DM. We’ll help make your snack dreams come true. Or, at the very least, we’ll make sure your machine doesn’t look like it was designed by someone who hates joy.

This one certainly is a unique one! So without further ado, please enjoy:

**Arctic Palace**

Opening: grapefruit and oranges on top of whatever I assume is red tea (giving a chai kind of feel here)? It gives a citrusy-spice vibe that is certainly unique. 

Mid: that red tea takes center stage now, supported a bit by the citrus notes.  Projection is ok- I wouldn’t say this is anything to run around and tell the neighbors about, but still respectable. Tonka and vanilla give this and interesting vibe that reminds me a little bit of coffee or brown sugar milk tea in the air. I actually looked around when I smelled it to see if we had left a cup sitting out somewhere. It has an interesting citrus-sweet characteristic that I haven’t smelled in any other fragrance I’ve tried.

Overall: I’ve seen this compared to a urinal puck many times, and while I would agree there are some aspects I could see that are similar, I do believe that this smells better than a urinal puck. 😆 It is certainly an interesting fragrance, and one that would be full bottle worthy if I was more into tea-related fragrances, and it definitely makes me want to try the OG, especially since it’s been 84 years since its last restock.",10,1767588568.0,MontagneParfums,13,0.86,False
1q4cex9,https://i.redd.it/01enqxw9ogbg1.jpeg,I made the switch from Distiller to RO system,"A few weeks ago I posted about using a water distiller for my carnivorous plants. After actually living with it for a bit, I realized it wasn’t the right tool for me!
- lots of heat
- more noise than I expected
- slower in real world use.
- too much clean-up (descaling)

Some comments mentioned that RO systems tend to be quicker and more practical, which lined up with what I was already noticing. I ended up switching to an RO/DI setup, and the install is now fully finalized. I luckily had some room in my laundry closet and things worked out great. I was able to split the cold water feed for my washing machine, thus having an accessible shut off specifically for the RO system.

What I’m liking so far:
- Much quieter
- No extra heat dumped into the room
- Continuous water instead of batch distilling
- Easy to dial water quality for different plant types

Tap water here is roughly 175 ppm. I’m now running different mixes depending on use:
- Carnivorous plants: 0 ppm (pure RO/DI)
- Succulents & cacti: 30-50 ppm
- Tropicals: 40-60 ppm
- Coffee: 75 ppm (for the wife, lol)

I added an 8 L (2.1 gallon) storage jug. 
Production rate is about 8.8 L in 1h20m (2.3 gallons), which seems pretty reasonable for a 50 GPD membrane.

Everything’s been running smoothly so far. If anyone spots something questionable or has suggestions, I’m happy to hear it, but overall I’m really happy I made the switch.

TL;DR Switched from Distiller to RO system based on sub feedback. Very thankful I did. ",4,1767588553.0,SavageGarden,3,0.83,False

Up to now I've paid for all of our dates, which I am fine with, since she recently quit her job. But also, she never offered to even buy me a drink or coffee throughout this entire time

Again, I didn't think much of it until we started planning to go on a trip. I planned everything from where we would go, where we would stay, and activities. I was ready to book, but it was all quite expensive, so I told her I'd cover the lodging (the most expensive part) and asked her to chip in for the rest

Well, she didn't take it well. She basically said no and said she would ""feel better about it"" if I could pay for everything

I asked her if this is because it's out of her current situation or because she expects me to pay for everything, all the time. And her response was that it's both

She also added that we're in a ""dating situation"" instead of a ""relationship"" so she expects me to pay for everything

I told her that I value reciprocity and equal effort and that I don't feel comfortable paying for everything and she left me on read

I think I’m just after some advice. My partner (30/M) and I have been together for 2.5 years. He has really incredible mates. They are all so down to earth, consistent, friendly and warm. I love them and I look forward to spending time with them. When he goes out with them, I love hearing about what they talk about and get up to. However, I do not like his best mate (30/M) who he has been friends with his whole life. At all. His best mate is different around all groups. I’ve never seen the same version twice. We have had conflict where he yelled at me at my partner’s birthday because we had a difference of opinion on education and political matters (I’m a teacher). He has this masculine “big guy” energy. I just cannot stand him. I have tried. I have initiated a coffee catch up to hash out our differences after he yelled at me. Which I went to and it was seemingly okay. I have also trained with him (he’s a PT) for 6 weeks where he BARELY asked me any questions about myself, it was all about him and his goals. 

I vented to my partner today and it’s upset him (to be fair, I wasn’t gentle about it). At the same time, he’s not upset AT me. He’s just disappointed it’s like this. While my partner said he can agree with many of the things I’ve said, he says it’s changed things for how we spend time with his best mate in the future as he’s now uncomfortable. I understand this and I’m not discrediting his feelings at all. I seldomly see his best mate anyway but I feel TERRIBLE. I don’t want my partner to feel he can’t hang out with his best mate. I would just like some advice on how I can better manage this or what your thoughts are. I can hear hard truths.

TL;DR: I don’t like my partner’s best friend. I vented this out and it’s upset him and it’s changed how he will or won’t invite him to things. I feel terrible. How do I manage this?",2,1767587915.0,relationships,5,1.0,False

I just need to vent.  Not really sure how to even condense this so bare with me, please.

Some background info: I'm 27 and he is 36 - I was 22 when we started dating and he had just turned 31. We have two kids together, but three at home total. I had one child before my bf and he had two children before me with two different women, but his kids live in other states and we don't see them, nor does he have contact with his oldest (his kid's mom blocked my ""partner"" and his entire family years ago) We have been together for 5 years - living together for over 4 years. He lived a state away and moved to my state/city when I found out I was pregnant. That was the first time I ever lived on my own let alone with somebody else as I lived at my mom's with my oldest while I went to school and worked part-time. I had my oldest at 18. Now we moved back to his home state/city and rent a house that his parent's bought for us to live in.

Ok, now onto the hardships and stories...

Our relationship has always been rocky and I've always struggled with trust issues well before he moved to my city. His friend group had always been problematic. He went out all time and didn't have a job. He was 31 with friends closer to my age or even in college and would frequent college bars every time they went out. That should've been my first red flag. He does have friends his age but they moved out of state and started their own lives. He lived with a roommate that to this day has no job other than dealing I guess.

After moving to my hometown and getting a place together he spent 90% of his time on his phone, watching sports or youtube, or playing COD/warzone with his friends and talking to his friends all night. He would play for for 8-12 hours a day. The  3.5 years he lived there he had about six different jobs, the last job being one my dad had gotten him which he did stay with for over a year. Anyway, our oldest together was born after three months of us living together. The first five months of our her life, her and I slept on the couch because he would get frustrated with her waking up so often when he had to work.

When we first got our place, he was jobless and I took out student loans to pay deposit, first months, and the first few months. Fast forward nine months we moved to a new, better apartment, he was starting another new job so again I used student loans to pay deposit and first two months. I got a part-time job and contributed. Again, same story, he just wasn't a present parent or partner. His priority was a screen and talking to his friends. He never took the kids to do anything nor would he want to do anything as a family. Every time he went back home he would go out with friends. Fast forward to our daughter being 1.5 we decided we shouldn't be together and I found out he had cheated two months into our relationship at the beginning. He moved back and stayed with his friend but a month later we decided we could give it another shot as he promised all of these changes. A month after that I found out I was pregnant with our second. After our second was born (at 2am), he went home at 7am (I still haven't slept while he napped at the hospital) and he left me at the hospital 5 hours postpartum and was gone for 2+ hours (who knows how much longer if I wasn't blowing up his phone). He went home and showered and watched Youtube while drinking coffee and whatever else he did. About a month later the night before mother's day, he tried to leave me and go back home so he could go out with friends and leave me with the kids. After pleading, he stayed but went back the following weekend.

A few months go by and I went on his phone after he got home from work and went to shower. His most recent app open was the app store and pulled up was an lgbtq app ""Taimi"". I re-downloaded it and put in his credentials, and low and behold he had an account. He said he forgot the app was on his phone and he went and deleted it, but that doesn't explain why he had it open on the app store, right? Before I asked him about the app, I also downloaded grindr and saw he had an account on there too but it was older pictures. His bio talked about looking for nice butt bottoms. Those accts were made with yahoo emails, and for some reason I thought of trying his apple id login too and he had accounts with his icloud email as well, so he had two accounts per app. He told me he just wanted to see what they were about and if trans women actually looked good???? I also went to his files app and saw that he had a deleted file that linked to a video on a g@y corn site. Earlier in the year, his google acct was logged in on my laptop and I saw his google search history of g@y corn sites specifically looking up big booty [tr@ns](mailto:tr@ns). He denied everything and ofc i gave him the benefit of the doubt both times. We moved on, but I've never really been able to shake the thought.

December of 2024 came and we still aren't getting along, he called me out of my name and that was it, I was done. He still lived in the apartment, as he was the one paying for it bc I was only working part time. He moved out at the end of February 2025 and into his parents house to care for their home as they moved across the country for a job. He and I both paid the rent while he was gone, come May 2025 he's begging to get back together and he was going to change and all this BS. I caved and thought well it would be good financially, the kids would get to see their dad, I get some help and whatever. This time he wanted us to move to his state. I agreed and thought we were turning a new leaf.... so we started planning, then July came and his parents bought a second house for us to rent from them, and then August came an me I packed the whole apartment up myself and moved myself + three kids into the house.

Recently, one weekend I took the kids and myself back home to visit my family. I set up the camera in the living room and on Saturday night/Sunday morning at two thirty AM he broke the camera. That following monday I had seen something about another person that prompted me to just check his laptop. His search history shocked me. Earlier in the year he had another search about tr@ns women and lqbtq sites.. but this time over the weekend was much worse. I saw him searching stuff about dogs and women. Women getting ... by dogs. I took pictures and video of the extensive search for proof. He told me it was a fb thing where this lady was talking about how people were freaking out that she did that and he said he was trying to find the whole story. I do not believe him.... it just doesn't add up. I'm going to leave and move back home but I've been stuck and I'm trying to create my exit plan. We just established care here and transferred schools... I have no job and no support. I have no friends or family here and his parents are out of state working. How do I even leave when my family is in another state  and I don't have any income??? Anyway, he has been sleeping in the basement ever since and contact is minimal and he is never alone with our kids and I will never allow for that.

I feel guilty for staying as long  as I have and part of me is feeling guilty for planning this leave because my kids love their dad... they love this house and having their own rooms and so much space, they love having a fenced in yard to run around in. I fear how they'll feel moving into an apartment.. and having to share bedrooms. I also feel guilty because right now there hasn't been arguing so how do I just get up and leave after some time has passed. I know, I know that leaving is the best and safest things to do and I'm doing it. I'm just trying to figure out how. I'm scared of the what ifs. What if I don't find a good job, what if I can't pay my bills, what if I can't pay my debt, what if I can't give my kids a good life? Right now, I have a cushion. I'm scared to fail.

Also adding, MY oldest has learning and behavioral disabilities and ASD.. and has never been treated fairly. He says my oldest is fully capable of understanding and doing right, and he treats my child as if they function as a neurologically normal child. It seems like he resents my child and me most of the time. He never makes time for my child when all my child wants is his attention.

These last few years I've been brain washed and made small by a narcissist. I just want to be in my own space, find myself again, and be a better parent to my kids. I want to be happy again. I want to become me. My entire 20's has been made small and I've been in survival mode. I'm tired of surviving.. I want to breathe and live again.",1,1767587810.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I am starting to feel like the novelty of starting Wellbutrin has begun to wear off. 
The first month was amazing - I was so active and doing so much shit and now I’m on month 4 and I find myself starting to bed rot more often and just feel overall tired again. 

When I first started the medicine I feel like my calendar was booked and busy and I’ve found myself canceling plans again. 
Im also feeling more apathetic to things and noticing I feel more “bothered”. 

I’m doing my best to fight through it by limiting social media, doing dry January and really challenging myself to get out in the world again. I went to a new coffee shop today and finished a book that’s been staring at me for like 4 months…so taking the small wins where I can. 

It’s starting to feel like pulling teeth to get shit done whereas the first month on Wellbutrin was so magical. 

Did anyone else experience this? 
Did you up your dosage? Did that help? 

Is this just what living feels like?!
