1ivzyr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CafelatRobot/comments/1ivzyr9/help_with_stripped_top_pin/,Help with stripped top pin,"New machine just got it today from Eight Ounce Coffee. I was installing the gauge kit onto my machine and when trying to remove the top pin with the arms it was quite tight on there (just putting my finger on the back wasn't working, it kept twisting the whole axle) and I tried using two 3 mm allen keys to get it off despite most videos only needing to hold the back pin with a finger. I ended up stripping the large pin/axel's threading, but I figure if I can get it off, I can loosely thread it back on like it should be and would only need to use the non-stripped smaller pin's threading while holding the back one with my finger, not needing to replace the stripped part. I'm at a loss how to get this off without drilling into the pin with a screw extractor (which I'm worried will make things worse if I damage the powder coat). I have tried rubber band method and it won't budge. Based on Paul's video here [Cable modification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njEDrwZkSmk) I assume it is normal threading so anti-clockwise loosens. I have the gauge on without the holding clip attached to the lever arm, but if I ever need to disassemble to replace anything like teflon washers or the arm, I'll be sol here. The couple shots I've pulled are great but the stripped screw (my fault admittedly) has put a damper on things today. These are the pics, any suggestions appreciated

1ivzveu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1ivzveu/baby_injured_3_times_in_less_than_2_months_im/,Baby injured 3 times in less than 2 months - I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I‚Äôm an unfit mother,"I may be slightly over exaggerating with the unfit thing (though definitely felt that way each time) but I am wondering if this is par for the course or if I‚Äôm just sucking at this.

The first injury was at his 6 month well check a week before he hit 6 months because we traveled the next week. I had him on the table (stupid high, no straps, hard floor) when the doctor came in and tried to wash his hands, but our stroller was blocking the sink. Kiddo was new to rolling and my brain did not work so I went to move the stroller and the baby fell onto his head in less than 3 seconds. He was ok but cried and screamed for half an hour.

2nd injury was 9 days later the day we got back from our trip. I was running on 2 hours sleep and air travel with a 6 month old (and getting my 75 year old mom to her flight, too) was exhausting. I also managed to leave all the formula at TSA so I was already feeling awesome. I was having the baby nap in bed with me and needed to use the bathroom‚Ä¶again, he rolled off in like 10 seconds. The bed was really low (less than 18‚Äù off the carpeted floor) but he somehow caught his lip somewhere and tore his frenulum (little piece of skin connecting your lip to your gums). We went to the emergency room for that one.

He‚Äôs now 7 months old. Today, he was just sitting in my lap on the sofa when he leaned forward, fell, and whacked his face on the edge of the coffee table. He has a tiny cut and a red line across his forehead and cheek.

The past week and a bit has been sooo hard. He‚Äôs had diarrhea and we haven‚Äôt been able to go anywhere so I‚Äôm going a bit crazy from that. He‚Äôs also in a sleep regression and woke up 7 times last night and napped a total of like an hour and a half over 3 semi-successful nap attempts today, with 2 other long periods of being clearly exhausted but not falling asleep. So I decided to be a bit of a bad mom and let him sit in my lap watching Wonder Blocks while I played with my phone. I guess I should‚Äôve kept an arm around him.

The need to be constantly vigilant with him is so draining. We moved here from another country when I was already pregnant and all my family is on the opposite coast of the US. My husband takes the baby whenever I ask (he works from home, I‚Äôm not working for now)but I always feel guilty that my husband isn‚Äôt getting enough of a break. Plus he usually just keeps the baby in his lap while he uses his computer, and I know that‚Äôs not awesome for the baby for long periods.

The baby also has a giant head, even for a baby. He‚Äôs around 50th percentile for both height and weight but his head circumference is 99th percentile. So he‚Äôs constantly just toppling over because he has the head of a 4 year old.

I try to play with my baby as much as possible and I‚Äôm constantly talking to him and singing songs etc. I love little kids, and of course especially him, but it‚Äôs been so monotonous lately, especially since I couldn‚Äôt take him anywhere or even feed him new things which was somewhat interesting, but we weren‚Äôt sure what was causing his diarrhea so we went back to just formula. 

Essentially, I feel like a crap mom. Is this normal?",0,1740278144.0,Mommit,0,0.5,False

Quick little post because I‚Äôve seen some similar ones that have been helpful, but I feel like a little more specific input would be appreciated. 

So, to cut to the chase my boyfriend forgot to pick me up from work today. He fell asleep, his phone died I guess, and he didn‚Äôt wake up on time (12:00pm) to pick me up so I ended up waiting 45 minutes for our roommate to get home and wake him up to get me. (info: 25 f/m, dating 4 years, living together)

I get accidents happen, so why does this matter so much? Because it‚Äôs not the first time. Not the second time either. Hell, not even the third time, but it‚Äôs the fourth time this has happened. And realistically, I wouldn‚Äôt have too much of a problem with ‚Äúbeing late‚Äù if there were ever any indication he‚Äôd be showing up, or if I‚Äôd been told beforehand I‚Äôd have to wait, etc. but that is never the case. Honestly, it just sucks having to go back into my job to wait and pay for an uber, or two of the times my boss has literally clocked out and driven me home themselves which is incredibly kind of them, but *so embarrassing* for me. Especially to be doing it so ‚Äúfrequently‚Äù they‚Äôve started to make comments about how my boyfriend ‚Äúneeds to get his shit together‚Äù because my bosses are literally at the point where they joke about scheduling someone to leave at the same time as me on the days he has my car because it keeps happening, which is lowkey kinda mean, but I don‚Äôt have any reason to believe it‚Äôs not coming from a place of concern at this point. This time I just straight up waited outside for an hour rather than having to bother my coworkers about that. 

On top of that we‚Äôre currently sharing one car, my car, while his gets fixed but he‚Äôs not employed and does school online so the only reason he even takes my car on days I work is if he says he wants to go get coffee on the morning, so not ever like a necessity. Today he wanted a coffee. He also picked me up, didn‚Äôt say a word and hasn‚Äôt spoken to me at all. No sorry, no nothing. When I decided to speak to him right now, literally 6+ hours after literally radio silence, he said well you already know I‚Äôm sorry and I feel guilty so why bother saying anything, and when I respond with realistically it‚Äôs for me not for you, he said ‚Äúokay fine you win, you win, you win‚Äù and literally walked out of the house to ‚Äútake a walk‚Äù.
The fuck?

At this point I‚Äôm just incredibly disappointed and feel like this dude isn‚Äôt gonna get his shit together because he can‚Äôt even do this one simple task that he knows makes me feel really bad and is entirely avoidable on a number of levels. I‚Äôm just feeling pretty drained and unimportant, and at this point am really just considering breaking up with him because at least I‚Äôll have a consistent ride home from work. 
How do I even (re)address this?

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Anyway, heya internet fam, just your casual City dwelling NJB looking to find his NJG saying hi and shavuah tov!

I'm going to try and make this not sound like a dating profile, but isn't this what it is anyway? So here are some fun things you should know about me:

* I am an educator but not a teacher, I am all about that programming and making a difference in the lives of those I work with and for.
* I love a wide variety of things, including but not limited to sports (especially men's and women's college basketball and baseball - Yankees baseball is back!), doing bar trivia every week, watching comedies and other non anxiety causing movies and tv shows (my current binge is the always wonderful Taskmaster), going on walks around the city and going to do nothing or read in various coffee shops, diners on Sundays.
* My Judaism is incredibly important to me yet, like the best of us, I constantly struggle with it. I used to go to shul every week, now very much not so much. My ideal shul is one that ins completely egalitarian and traditional and also doesn't dilly dally and is in and out in 2 hours. I keep a ""conservative"" style of Kashrut (Kosher home, dairy and vegetarian out). I am not traditionally shomer shabbat (though my rule is I am observing it by literally not doing any work or things I find unenjoyable).
* I am politically liberal and regards to Israel, I have a great love for the land and its people and also a great hatred of the current government there. I could discuss more about this but also in general politics give me a great deal of anxiety as is...
* I am looking for someone around my age, arbitrarily I generally would say between 26 and 36.
* I want to stay in NYC as long as I possibly can, I love it here and have always loved it here, and it would be great if you were also in this situation.

I just upgraded from a Rancilio Rocky to the Niche Zero. While the Rocky was inconsistent and wasn't getting the most from my lighter roasts, it was pulling fine shots. I started playing with the Niche, and it seems like something is way off with the grind. For one, when I grind at the size in the ""Espresso Fine"" threshhold, the shots are not pulling at all. When I go up to coarser, I can pull a shot in 80 seconds. I went into the coarser range of ""Filter Coffee"" and it took 45 seconds. 

FWIW, I was pulling 19g - 19.5g with the Rocky on one of the finest grinds. With the Niche, I'm pulling 18.5g and even 18g, and still can't get a decent shot out. If you're interested in my workflow, I'm letting the machine heat to 202f / 203f for 30 minutes. I'm grinding into the cup, pouring into the portafilter and weighing it again to make sure there was no retention. I am then leveling with an Asso Jack, and then normal tamp. Since this started, I've been running with the flow control close to neutral and running a steady 9 bar. 

I've also calibrated the grinder to make sure it wasn't off.

1ivzljk,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeetPeople/comments/1ivzljk/34m_chat_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection/,34/M [Chat] - Longing for intense and deep connection and seeking the casual chat that leads to it,"Hello! 

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* **Knowing yourself is critical to me, and it should be to you too.** I absolutely don't require someone to know themselves fully, and am eagerly accepting of people who don't know themselves well or are even at a loss. But, you should know some basic things about yourself. I've had so many people message me and lose interest when they find out I don't game daily or share some hyper specific stance of a cultural phenomenon. Do you have a hobby or belief that would be considered a ""deal breaker"" for you if someone didn't also share it? If you do, really know what and why that is and bring it up early.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelg√§ngers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.

1ivzkbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/auscorp/comments/1ivzkbj/seeking_advice_navigating_decisionmaking_in_the/,Seeking Advice: Navigating Decision-Making in the Absence of Management,"
Hi everyone,
For some context, I work in a team where management is often unavailable. My direct manager and senior case manager were out for a couple of days and we were told as staff we can‚Äôt contact them and that management trust our decision making, the day they were supposed to be back, My direct manager was working from another office and said they would be unavailable for a lot of the day due meetings, and the senior case manager was sick. This is fairly common, and I‚Äôm often left to make decisions in their absence. In fact, many of my colleagues rely on me for training and information, as they trust me. New staff frequently provide feedback that they feel unsupported by management, so I end up stepping in to fill that gap.

In this particular situation, I had an issue that required clarification on legal obligations, not internal procedures. The area manager was in the office ( my managers bosses manager) and I took the chance to ask for guidance. Since the issue was about legal requirements, the area manager couldn‚Äôt provide a definitive answer but referred me to another higher up state manager (Manager B) for guidance and gave me her contact information to reach out. I reached out to Manager B, and during our discussion, they mentioned an upcoming Community of Practice session that they were holding and asked if we all attend, due to obligations of our job only one staff member usually attends those meetings in which I told her.  Manager B kindly offered to hold a separate session for our team as she works upstairs from us in the building and really wants to meet our team. 

I then emailed my direct manager and senior case manager to pass on this information and suggested they coordinate if they felt it would be helpful. Here‚Äôs the email I sent:

Employee‚Äôs Email to Leadership:

Subject: Potential Info Session with Manager B

Hi [Direct Manager] & [Senior Case Manager],

While clarifying a child safety policy with Manager B, she mentioned that she was hosting an information session at COP. I let her know that we typically don‚Äôt all attend due to location differences, and she offered to hold a session specifically for our team to provide relevant updates.

I wanted to pass this along in case you would like to coordinate something.

Let me know your thoughts!

Thanks,
[Employee]

The response I received from my direct manager was that I should have consulted them before reaching out to Manager B and emphasized that organizing training or updates is outside my role. They also mentioned the importance of following internal processes, even though my inquiry was about a legal clarification.

Manager‚Äôs Response:

Hi [Employee],

Thank you for being proactive in seeking opportunities to connect with our colleagues at [Organization].

I‚Äôd like to understand how you connected with Manager B regarding this opportunity.

For future reference, please run this type of networking past me before proceeding, as there are existing processes in place for child-inclusive practice. I would have been able to provide you with this information and prevent you from coordinating something that may not be the best use of everyone‚Äôs time.

Organizing the rollout of new frameworks and practices falls within leadership‚Äôs responsibility and is therefore outside your role‚Äôs scope.

I know your intentions were good, but please be mindful of this going forward. Feel free to discuss further if needed.

Thanks,
[Direct Manager]

The manager never emailed or called me to clarify on the situation and I didn‚Äôt feel I needed explicit permission to speak with Manager B because I was directed to do so by the area manager, and the issue was about legal requirements. I understand that internal processes are important, but I was just trying to ensure that our team was aligned with legal obligations while our direct leadership was unavailable. Also for context another colleague who isn‚Äôt in management often have coffees with upper management such as the ceo due to personal relationships and are never picked up for it. 
So, I‚Äôm reaching out for advice: Did I handle this appropriately given the circumstances, or should I have approached it differently? In our environment, management is often unavailable, and I‚Äôm frequently left to make decisions or provide guidance to my colleagues. Given that many rely on me for support and training, I‚Äôm unsure whether I overstepped by taking initiative or if I was just trying to fill a gap that exists due to management‚Äôs frequent unavailability. I have great relationships with stakeholders and historically assumptions have been made that I‚Äôm management due to my good communication  and availability. My colleagues that are experienced often come to me for support and information also as I am someone they know is available.  Management have often come to me stating they are concerned about my communication and because I‚Äôm passionate are concerned I will blow up to stakeholders which has never happened, since that conversation I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôve been not picked for many interactions. Can I also just stress again my colleagues and the community we work with value me greatly, the only people who don‚Äôt are management.
How do I navigate this because I feel like it‚Äôs starting to border unfair

1ivzk3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryStories/comments/1ivzk3q/snow_day/,Snow Day.,"*I wrote this about a month ago when Florida was getting our first snow in years. Then I forgot to post it here. Lol. Enjoy.*

It's snowing in Florida. Not totally out of this world, but it is rare. What is unusual is the amount of accumulation and how far south it is going. I've been here 20+ years and only once did we have MAYBE a 1/16"" accumulation. 

My county is under a winter storm advisory for the first time in history. Pretty wild. School is open tomorrow though, so I don't think we are actually getting snow. (EDIT: We didn't. Just north of us they did.) How wild would it be to get a snow day in Florida?

January 11th, 1992 was a Friday. I was stationed at Fort Bliss, in El Paso, Texas pending my discharge in couple of months. A desert environment on the border with Mexico. The desert could get cold at night. It had been cold the night before, and it had certainly been below freezing before, but I didn't think much of it as I turned in for the night. Morning PT had already been cancelled due to the cold, but our first formation at 0730 was still on as far as I knew.

Overnight, the temps really dropped and we got 3 inches of snow according to the historical record I found. So next to nothing for someone who grew up in Colorado, Illinois and Germany. Although I am sure there were [some huskies living there that were thrilled](https://imgur.com/gallery/climate-change-isnt-real-8Q1XBCi), the people weren't. For the city of El Paso, it was extremely unusual. No, it was worse. It was the End Times, and people promptly freaked out as would be expected. 

I woke up, got my day started, got on my uniform and stepped outside the apartment. Boots polished, starched uniform, combat patch, I looked *sharp.* I opened the front door of my apartment on the hill overlooking downtown El Paso. I nearly dropped my thermos of coffee. (Because barracks coffee is shit.) Snow on the ground. Dafuq? I wanted to slap myself awake. I stood on my doorstep, coffee in one hand and keys in the other. I took a sip as I contemplated this white stuff on the ground. It was snow alright. I had last seen it in Korea. Before that, West Germany. Illinois. Colorado. But Never in Texas or New Mexico. In any case, it wasn't a big deal for me - I could drive in this. As I stepped away from my door, I heard my phone ringing (a landline for you dinosaurs like me out there, because this was the very beginning of cell phones and I didn't have one yet), but didn't want to go in to answer it. I walked down the stairs into my private garage (a luxury in apartments, and one that let me keep my TA-50 ready to go for alerts), got the truck warmed up and left for post to go to work.

On the way out, I came upon a neighbor whose car had stalled out. We popped the hood, and I noticed their carb wasn't opening all the way. Amazing - my mechanic experience in the Army was paying off. So I got a screwdriver to pop the valve open while they started it, and it fired right up. It was just cold and needed oxygen, and I showed them what to do if it died again. 

Leaving the apartment complex and heading to post, I saw quite a few accidents. All of them were caused by excessive speed. Everyone seemed OK as I passed and there wasn't shit I could do, so I kept going. My truck was light in the ass end and didn't do great in the snow, but I went slow enough it was OK. I listened to the radio. The airport was cancelling flights. Schools were closing. Police were encouraging you to self-report car accidents the next day as they were overwhelmed.

I finally parked at the unit and walked in. The CO, XO and First Sergeant were in. They were standing around the CQ desk talking. *""Cobb - didn't you get the message?""* Ah, the phone call I didn't take. 

Turned out Fort Bliss had gone to essential personnel only. The rest of the junior enlisted living in the barracks were upstairs, sleeping in after breakfast and being given the day off. So after some more of the Army famous ""hurry and wait"", the CO finally sent the few of us there from off post home for the day. The snow was mostly gone in the late morning/early afternoon, and life returned to normal. 

I get that they weren't used to dealing with it, but that little bit of snow shut everything down. The whole city was acting like it was the End Times. Parts of Florida are behaving that way right now with the snow coming in. I have a mutt who thinks she is part Husky and is loving the cold. (She isn't - she is an American Airhead and Chaos Hound mix.) I do kinda wish we would get snow so she could see it. What really sucks is I'm home sick and have been sick since Thursday. Being immuno-compromised sucks big time. I'm supposed to take two busses of students on a field trip tomorrow, and I seriously don't think I'm going to make it. 

Not a snow day, but a sick day instead. Ugh. Just had some chicken soup, so that always makes me feel (emotionally) better at least.

When we first got together about 8 months ago, the sex was insane and frequent and we even bought sex straps and some other devices to enhance our experiences in the bedroom. We haven‚Äôt even used those, and shortly after the 4th month or so our sex severely declined. 

I love him so much, and sex isn‚Äôt everything, but it is a crucial component of a relationship for me and is essential for my emotional connection with someone. Whenever I bring this up to him, he gets frustrated and defensive and basically claims he‚Äôs too tired, or we‚Äôre too busy and have too much to do, or it‚Äôs too late, it‚Äôs too early, he hasn‚Äôt had coffee yet.. yada yada. I‚Äôve been nice about it; tried to be careful with my wording, but it basically always ends with me sobbing and him walking away and stonewalling me. 

I want to fucking marry this man and I just want to have some intimacy, damnit. It‚Äôs starting to feel like a lost cause. Has anyone had a similar experience? If so, is there anything you tried that helped your situation? Thanks. ",3,1740276919.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* **Knowing yourself is critical to me, and it should be to you too.** I absolutely don't require someone to know themselves fully, and am eagerly accepting of people who don't know themselves well or are even at a loss. But, you should know some basic things about yourself. I've had so many people message me and lose interest when they find out I don't game daily or share some hyper specific stance of a cultural phenomenon. Do you have a hobby or belief that would be considered a ""deal breaker"" for you if someone didn't also share it? If you do, really know what and why that is and bring it up early.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelg√§ngers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way.

1ivzgwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/1ivzgwm/red_cross_donations/,Red Cross donations,"Not a paid promoter, so I unmarked as brand affiliate cuz I don‚Äôt want this taken down, but I‚Äôm gonna fangirl and infodump enough about how awesome the donation center across from mellow mushroom is and how everyone should go there and why it benefits you- I may as well be one.



Gonna categorize this into groups of info:

1- why donate, for yourself or for others/what do I get out of it and what good does it do?

Save lives, get gift cards, have a steady chart available to show your hemoglobin and both blood pressure numbers. Next month they‚Äôre also doing free A1C checks too (basically you donate blood and they can check you for diabetes or pre-diabetes for free which would not be the case with a doctor) they will also tell you if there is a reason your blood wasn‚Äôt able to be used (aka if you donate blood and they find out you have a blood disease, they will tell you that you have one, which can save YOUR life.) Also there is a rewards program, and they‚Äôre almost constantly running promotions that give you extra points for trying or automatic extra gift cards if you successfully donate. Aka- I donate platelets as often as I can which is basically every week, and get like 200pts each donation plus whatever bonuses, and I exchange 500pts for $10 gift cards plus whatever bonus ones they send me links for as well. I also get snacks every time I go, even if my donation fails. So basically- free snacks, health info, and $10-$20 per month plus extra for promotions they‚Äôre running. Also the app has different achievements that are fun to collect, and you can join a team (VT is currently behind UVA‚Ä¶üëÄ)

2- what types of donations are there, what are they like, and what are they for?

There are 4 types that ANYONE can do, then there‚Äôs the special AB+ that only special people with that blood type can do (annoys me that there‚Äôs an achievement badge in my face I can‚Äôt unlock ever üòí)

Whole blood: once every 8 wks. Takes about 15min, can be done at blood drives as well as donation centers. Fastest easiest one to do and only takes one arm ever. 
Power Red: once every 16 wks. Double dose of red blood cells. Longest wait time between donations because red blood cells take the longest to regenerate of all the blood components. This one is important for issues of oxygen circulation, like sickle cell anemia or hemorrhagic shock. Basically the body can‚Äôt get oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body because there aren‚Äôt enough red blood cells capable of delivering the oxygen, and it can be life threatening, hence why red blood cells are especially important.
Platelets: once every 7 days. This is the blood component responsible for different forms of bodily repair. Platelets hold the coagulating factors in blood and control the fibrin responsible for closing wounds and catching red blood cells to form scabs. Platelets are important for bleeding conditions like hemophilia, and are commonly used to treat cancer patients. Cancer treatments take a huge toll on the body, so it makes sense that repair cells need to be replaced. Also, expect to be there for like 3 hours between the setup, donation time, and getting unhooked and making sure you‚Äôre safe to get home. They WILL give you a tv remote and headphones to binge watch whatever you want on the Roku attached to your bed, and there are two ways to do this- one arm or 2. 2 arm is best and safest (for donation purposes), and 1 arm gives you the freedom to get work done on a laptop if you need to. Great way to study imo. Ppl only bother you to check if you‚Äôre good, give you snacks, and keep your appt going smoothly. Other than that, they leave you alone. You can study in a comfy bed with unlimited juice or water bottles and they will bring you ‚Äúfresh out of the dryer warm‚Äù blankets.
Plasma: once every 27 days. This component is basically the carrier fluid of blood. You have different types of blood cells floating around in this component like organelles in cytoplasm. This component can be co-donated with platelets without either donation disrupting the ‚Äúrefill‚Äù pace of the other. Aka- you can donate both together and still donate platelets 3 times before you donate plasma again. However, donating together DOES make the platelet donation go faster.

3- what if I don‚Äôt like blood/needles or I‚Äôve had bad experiences before:?

I have too. Like REALLY bad to the point where I cannot have a needle stick without STARING directly at it as it‚Äôs going in because I do not trust that it is going to be done correctly unless I am actively watching every second. Had a Dr mess up once as a kid and completely ignore me screaming nonstop when I should‚Äôve been out in seconds from the stuff that wasn‚Äôt going into my vein cuz he was several mm‚Äôs off from it and ignored a child pointing it out when it was obvious because what does a little kid know. That plus a Dr messing up my mothers epidural with one of my siblings and doing the same thing tryna gaslight her over HIS fk up. So I have zero trust with anyone poking needles in me unless I am VERY comfortable with that person‚Äôs skill and history with ME specifically. I still stare at the needle going in and out, but I don‚Äôt mind having the gauze over it during the procedure and I‚Äôm able to chill for hours with it in my arm unless something actually happens which is NOT their fault (like if I move my own arm on accident and poke myself too far- which has happened and it hurts for a minute tops while they stop the machine and unhook my arm. No biggie.) when I say I trust these people and I find them to be astonishingly skilled and that they care more about my comfort than I do??? I‚Äôm dead serious. Any amount of pain I go through is entirely my choice and usually my insistence to keep going if something isn‚Äôt perfectly spot on. They prioritize the donor‚Äôs comfort over the donation and borderline fawn over you. I have stories I will happily share in the comments of just how much motherly care and concern they show EVERY TIME. I have had bad experiences but NEVER here. They are PHENOMENAL. As for seeing blood or needles, you do not have to look, they cover the needle with a gauze pad once it‚Äôs in, and the whole blood takes 15min. The more hydrated you are, the faster it goes. They also keep the bag below the arm of the chair for whole blood so you literally cannot see it unless you lean over and look down past your arm. And the tube? You can always put a jacket/shawl over it if it bothers you that much, but it really just looks like a curly straw full of cherry juice. Like black/morello cherry, not maraschino cherries. 

4- what about the side effects?

Most of these are self-inflicted by specific conditions we make for ourselves. For whole blood or power red at blood drives, it can freak people out to see someone get up and pass out onto the floor. That‚Äôs not actually normal, and usually happens from one or multiple of these reasons:
- didn‚Äôt eat for a while before donating. Never donate on an empty stomach. This is literally why they have snacks and tell you to help yourself before you‚Äôre even on the donating bed. They want you to keep your blood sugar and electrolytes and hydration up.
- low body mass. There‚Äôs a reason they have a minimum for people to donate and an age limit for how old you have to be. They take a set amount of blood (basically a pint), so tiny Human with less total blood volume is gonna feel it more because a larger proportion of their total blood volume is missing.
- got up too fast without any water or juice and/or locked your legs
- multiple donations in a sitting (my sister has only passed out one time from a donation, and it was at a different center where they took a triple platelet double plasma donation all in one sitting, with her consent ofc, but HIGHLY unusual and kind of extreme to do. Nobody falling to the ground suddenly scares me as much as watching my sister turn grey and suddenly go limp in a chair did. She was totally fine but they legally had to call an ambulance to carry her to the hospital across the street, even though she was only out for like 30s or less. Again, extreme donation and only time it ever happened, and it wasn‚Äôt here, plus she consented to that donation knowing the risks and she was totally fine. She even laughed it off.)
Pheresis donations (platelets and plasma) come with some other possible side effects due to the fact that they take a longer time, your blood is largely sitting outside of your body, it comes back in with a saline/anticoagulant mixed in, and being outside your body for any amount of time lowers it‚Äôs temperature upon re-entry to the body, meaning lots of things. You will likely get very cold, which is why they basically have an oven full of blankets which they will PILE onto you whenever you ask for them. They will continue to blanket you to the moon if you‚Äôre cold. You may feel sick to your stomach. Tell them this. They will give you tums because that‚Äôs basically your body‚Äôs reaction to the stuff they added to your blood to keep it from freezing or getting gummy etc. and you not having enough calcium in your blood stream to handle it. People who don‚Äôt like the chalky feel or taste of tums- bring your own antacid chews and/or some good old choccy milk/cocoa. Cocoa will help keep your blood sugar up, warm you up from the INSIDE, and raise your calcium. They highly recommend having calcium rich foods (milk, yogurt, ice cream, antacids, etc.) before and during your appt if you have issues or are worried about having issues like this. They WILL take care of you to the best of their abilities and they are prepared for these things, but these are tips to avoid those issues altogether. Highly recommend the hot choccy. Anyone with a period- iron is an issue for us! It fluctuates a LOT. And coffee (and tea sometimes too) can mess with your iron absorption! Here is a list of foods that are good to help with that around campus whether or not you eat beef:
‚Ä¢ southwest steak wrap with spinach (extra spinach if they‚Äôll give it to you, choice of tortilla or bowl doesn‚Äôt matter) there‚Äôs loads of iron in the steak, plus the spinach, and there‚Äôs calcium in the cheese and sour cream.
‚Ä¢ Greens and ginger smoothie from Jamba. It‚Äôs got the spinach and kale mix full of iron and a lemonade base full of vitamin C to help with absorption. It‚Äôs also one of their healthiest smoothies and it‚Äôs delicious, with a tart zing from the ginger and citrus. This also helps boost your immunity as well.
‚Ä¢ burger 37 in general. If I‚Äôm running late, I will order a burger ahead, doesn‚Äôt really matter which as long as it‚Äôs beef. The iron won‚Äôt kick in same day, but there will be calcium in the cheese and if my iron is low, i can try again the next day with the hopes that the burger helped. Again, you can pair this with a lemonade or orange juice, or grab a milkshake for extra calcium and blood sugar but‚Ä¶
- hot chocolate from any of the cafe‚Äôs. Squires booth has hot chocolate and milk steamers to give you warmth, sugar, and calcium on your way to your appt. Much better for pheresis.
- soup garden has steak options for salad and lemon and lime vinaigrettes for salad dressings, along with spinach. You can do spinach for iron with or without steak, and the citrus vineagrette will increase the absorption.
- TIME YOUR COFFEE!!! Coffee is fine to drink but can mess up your iron absorption. You need to have it NOT at the same time as your iron rich foods. Think an hour apart okay? An hour before or after. You do not want them digesting together. It‚Äôs similar to bananas and polyphenols. It‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt wanna have bananas in your health juices/smoothies, cuz it ruins the absorption of all the other good for you chemicals under the category ‚Äúpolyphenols‚Äù if they‚Äôre eaten even 30min apart. Same concept, different interaction.
- don‚Äôt diet the day of your donation. I am so serious rn. They have unhealthy snacks for a REASON. You need the electrolytes and sugar. If you have issues, bring something similar that fits your own wants/needs, like fruit or a granola bar. I will tell you they usually have cheezits, two types of medium cookie, mini Oreos, Welch‚Äôs fruit snacks, and cheese sandwich crackers, sometimes other stuff. They always have apple juice, grape juice, fruit punch, and water. Eat before your donation or you will not feel good. Let me reiterate- if you do not eat for several hours before you donate, you will more likely feel lightheaded, tummy achey, pass out, or otherwise just #Not-Great ü§® EAT FOOD. Even if it‚Äôs asking for cookies and juice WHILE you‚Äôre donating because you realize you forgot to eat, they will hold a juicebox up to your face if you‚Äôve got a two arm donation going. Legit princess treatment because THEY WANT YOU TO BE COMFORTABLE!!!! 

5- why are you this interested/happy about THIS particular center?

I can never talk enough about how skilled Lucy, Jacob, Kat, and the rest of the team are. Like- I‚Äôve had HORRIBLE experiences with other donation centers (never go to Red Cross fairfax Va. ever. Gave them 3 chances, and they managed to make each experience exceptionally uncomfortable even if I didn‚Äôt even make it to the donor bed. I will only ever go to INOVA up their because that center has a complete lack of competency and attentiveness that this team here in blackburg has in SPADES.) I actively look forward to my donations because it is the vibe equivalent of a warm hug and a cup of hot choccy in a snuggly soft blanket I kid you not. Like- most of the team is moms. And then there‚Äôs Jacob. There is legit nothing to be embarrassed about with those questions, they feel bad having to ask if you‚Äôre eating or you just did the pass like 5 minutes before (ah yes, I went to jail for solicitation in the past 20 minutes and spent a consecutive 48 hours there because I‚Äôm a time traveler with nothing better to do- they‚Äôve got a good sense of humor so you can give them a sarcastic answer then and be straight up and they‚Äôll input your real answer and laugh at ur joke.)



Anyways!!! If you have any other questions I am BEYOND happy to share!! This is legit how I find my own personal fun stuff without a job. I don‚Äôt have time or energy for one, but this works as multitasking. I get to sit in a bed with blankies and juice while binging Netflix or doing homework, then I get rewarded for it. :3 ",1,1740276825.0,VirginiaTech,0,0.67,False

I started my sugar free journey in July 2024 - a 30 day challenge. I got through most of it without cheating (I recall one ice cream cone and a few glasses of wine). It was a steep decline from what I normally ate (candy a few times a week, sugar in my coffee and white bread a few times a week). From July to December I largely stayed sugar free. I enjoyed sweets on occasion, I did not completely cut it out but I dropped 15 pounds pretty easily (and I was already a healthy weight).

Since the new year I had to have an emergency  surgery and was off my feet and ate a few more sweet treats out of boredom. Still somewhat disciplined but not like before. I am on vacation right now and have been having a sweet treat or two each day and I feel my sugar free life slipping from me. I am writing here to make myself accountable again. I really enjoy life sugar free and am excited to return to it.

I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* **Knowing yourself is critical to me, and it should be to you too.** I absolutely don't require someone to know themselves fully, and am eagerly accepting of people who don't know themselves well or are even at a loss. But, you should know some basic things about yourself. I've had so many people message me and lose interest when they find out I don't game daily or share some hyper specific stance of a cultural phenomenon. Do you have a hobby or belief that would be considered a ""deal breaker"" for you if someone didn't also share it? If you do, really know what and why that is and bring it up early.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelg√§ngers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",0,1740276725.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.5,False
1ivzdi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossDietsDaily/comments/1ivzdi1/mitolyn_review_the_hidden_metabolism_secret_no/,Mitolyn Review: The Hidden Metabolism Secret No One Talks About,"https://preview.redd.it/b0sr181krske1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81e9dfcd3e7725958977b592ca8cd96a5d91a119

I was skeptical.

I had tried everything. Keto, intermittent fasting, two-hour gym sessions, even that weird lemon-cayenne cleanse everyone swore by. Nothing worked. My energy levels were in the gutter, my metabolism felt like it was running on fumes, and no matter what I did, the scale wouldn‚Äôt budge.

Then I stumbled across something different‚Äîsomething that promised to target the *real* issue. Not just another fad. Not another gimmick. This was about mitochondria‚Äîthe powerhouse of the cell. I had heard that phrase back in high school biology, but I never realized how much those tiny engines inside me controlled *everything*.

Within the first week, I felt something shift.

My morning grogginess? Gone. Instead of dragging myself out of bed and chugging coffee like my life depended on it, I actually *woke up*‚Äîrefreshed. My afternoon crashes? Disappeared. It was like someone flipped a switch inside me, turning on a steady, all-day flow of energy. No jitters, no crash‚Äîjust pure, effortless momentum.

Then came the weight loss.

Two weeks in, my clothes started fitting differently. I wasn‚Äôt bloated. I wasn‚Äôt constantly hungry. My cravings for sugar, carbs, and late-night snacks? Fading. I wasn‚Äôt forcing myself to diet‚ÄîI just *didn‚Äôt want* the junk anymore. My body was burning fat *without* me obsessing over it.

By the one-month mark, I was *stunned*.

The scale was down 12 pounds. My face looked leaner. My stomach? Flatter. My mind was sharper, my mood was *better*, and for the first time in years, I felt *alive*.

This wasn‚Äôt just another weight loss supplement. This was something different‚Äîsomething that *actually* worked. And the best part? It wasn‚Äôt just about fat loss. My metabolism was *on fire*, my energy was limitless, and my body was finally working *for* me instead of against me.

I wasn‚Äôt dragging myself through workouts‚ÄîI was *crushing* them. I wasn‚Äôt relying on caffeine to get through the day‚ÄîI was naturally *wired*. I didn‚Äôt feel like I was fighting an uphill battle‚ÄîI felt *unstoppable*.

If you‚Äôre tired of the gimmicks, tired of the frustration, tired of feeling *stuck*‚Äîthis is what you‚Äôve been waiting for.

No starvation. No overcomplicated routines. No ‚Äúmagic pills‚Äù that do nothing.

Just real, sustainable results.

And I‚Äôm living proof.

I refused to accept that my body was just ‚Äúbroken.‚Äù

I knew something was off. No matter how clean I ate, how much I exercised, or how many so-called ‚Äúmetabolism boosters‚Äù I tried, nothing worked. The fatigue, the stubborn weight, the sluggish metabolism‚Äîit all felt like an impossible wall I couldn‚Äôt break through.

So I did what most people don‚Äôt. I started digging.

I wasn‚Äôt looking for another diet or a trendy workout plan. I wanted to know the **real** reason why my body refused to burn fat efficiently. Why I felt drained all the time. Why my cravings controlled me instead of the other way around.

And I found it.

Everything pointed back to **mitochondria**‚Äîthe tiny power plants inside your cells that determine how much energy you produce, how efficiently your body burns fat, and how well your metabolism functions.

The truth was simple but shocking: **If your mitochondria are sluggish, your body stays stuck.**

That‚Äôs why no amount of calorie-cutting or high-intensity training had worked for me. My body wasn‚Äôt *processing energy correctly*. I wasn‚Äôt broken‚ÄîI just needed to **fix my mitochondrial function** at the source.

That‚Äôs when I came across something different.

Unlike the usual weight loss solutions that focus on appetite suppression, water loss, or temporary boosts in metabolism, this approach was based on **scientific principles of mitochondrial activation**.

It wasn‚Äôt about forcing my body to burn fat. It was about **reprogramming my metabolism at the cellular level** so it naturally worked for me, not against me.

I looked into the key ingredients‚Äînutrients that specifically **target mitochondrial health, energy production, and fat oxidation**. These weren‚Äôt just random herbs thrown together. They were backed by **real research** on how to:

**Supercharge mitochondria so they burn fat more efficiently**  
**Eliminate fatigue by increasing cellular energy output**  
**Reduce cravings by balancing key metabolic hormones**  
**Support healthy aging and long-term metabolic function**

It made sense. And for the first time in years, I finally had hope.

Within a few weeks, I *felt* the difference.

**More energy. Clearer mind. Faster fat loss.**

The best part? It wasn‚Äôt a temporary fix. My body wasn‚Äôt just shedding water weight or running on stimulants. It was **rebuilding a metabolism that actually worked**.

This wasn‚Äôt just another diet or supplement. This was **the missing piece** I had been searching for all along.

I agreed, but since then, there‚Äôs been nothing but silence. I followed up once to check if it was still happening, but I‚Äôm not going to keep chasing for an answer.

My name is Fernando. I‚Äôm just another IT executive who got tired of the stress of big corporations and decided to retire. Not because my body asked for it, but because my mind demanded it. I just needed to rest, let time pass quietly, and avoid crashing head-on into the burnout train.

I‚Äôm not married, I don‚Äôt have kids, which, I confess, made it easier to take a sharp turn like this: I bought a rural property in the countryside and moved there. My plan was simple‚Äîstudy, enjoy the video games my exhausting work routine never allowed, read, and reflect a bit.

I found the perfect property, about **30 km from the city center**. A dirt road, isolated, exactly what I was looking for. I invested a good amount of money to bring in **renewable energy and water**. I also spent a chunk of my savings to give a **serious facelift** to the house that was already there: **a huge old colonial mansion, extremely spacious but falling apart.**

During my trips to check on the renovation, I met my neighbor, **Ti√£o**. A rugged man who lived with his wife and two young children in **a wattle and daub house**, about **5 km from my property**. Other than Ti√£o‚Äôs house, there was **nothing else on that side of the Tiet√™ River**. I was told it was **a protected area**, so nobody bought land there because **it couldn‚Äôt be legally developed**.

But **Ti√£o lived there, strong and steady.**

One late afternoon, I stopped my truck in front of his house.

He seemed **friendly**, came out to greet me, but his wife and kids stayed at the window, **watching me, hesitant**.

Our conversation, as I remember it, went something like this:

‚Äî **Good afternoon. I bought the mansion at the end of Estrada da Jurema. How‚Äôs it going?**

‚Äî **Good afternoon. You‚Äôre gonna like the area.** My name‚Äôs **Ti√£o**, and inside are my wife and kids. **We don‚Äôt get many visitors, so they‚Äôre a bit wary of stepping outside.**

‚Äî **My name‚Äôs Fernando. I brought a box of fruit for the neighbors.** ‚Äî I handed him the box.

‚Äî **That wasn‚Äôt necessary, sir. But I appreciate it.** Phone signal‚Äôs weak here, but if you ever need anything and I can help, just let me know.

He hesitated, then added:

‚Äî **Look, I don‚Äôt mean to be rude, but it‚Äôs better we don‚Äôt stand here talking too long.** It‚Äôs getting dark, and **there are jaguars in this region.**

**Jaguars?**

‚Äî **Why don‚Äôt you come by earlier one day? We can have some coffee.**

‚Äî **Sounds good. I‚Äôll be stopping by the house next week and can drop by later, if that‚Äôs okay.**

Ti√£o‚Äôs face changed.

‚Äî **You‚Äôre not gonna tear down the mansion, are you?**

His tone was **completely different now.**

‚Äî **No, no, just a renovation to make it more livable.** But why? **Is something wrong?**

Ti√£o‚Äôs shoulders **relaxed slightly**.

‚Äî **Nothing, sir. I just like that house. Lots of memories there, that‚Äôs all.**

He seemed **relieved.**

**I had no idea that conversation was the beginning of my problems.**

---

# The renovation went smoothly.

The contractor mentioned that there was a high turnover of workers. Nobody wanted to spend the night there. Too isolated. No phone signal. No internet. Nothing. I made a mental note to install satellite internet. I wanted peace and quiet, but internet was as essential as coffee.

I kept the original layout of the house, with a few modifications. I merged two bedrooms into a large office. The largest bedroom became my master suite. The living room and kitchen were now open-concept. Inside, the house was modern and well-equipped.

From the outside, it was still the same old colonial mansion‚Äîonly now, extremely well-maintained.

There were other areas of the property that I didn‚Äôt touch. (I wasn‚Äôt made of money.) And maybe I could fix them up myself‚Äîa new hobby, perhaps.

On the highest point of the property, there was a small ancient chapel, completely falling apart.

A barn, just as old, in dire need of either a complete renovation or outright demolition.

I even considered getting rid of my truck and replacing it with horses. I kept that thought in the back of my mind.

There was also a small animal enclosure.

It looked like an old, abandoned chicken coop, where goats and other small animals had probably been kept in the past. The enclosure was connected to a small room that must have been used as a slaughterhouse.

But it had been a long, long time since any farm animals had been there‚Äîexcept for the rats and possums that probably scurried through the place now.

At the far end of the property, deep in the woods, there was a stream branch and an old ruined shack.

From its condition, I guessed it had once been a storage shed for fishing gear.

But now, it was just a rotting husk.

# With the renovation complete and the internet installed, it was the perfect retreat.

**The zombie apocalypse could happen, and nothing would change in my routine. Hell, I could even start planting something. My grocery trips would become even less frequent.**

**On the day I moved in, I was excited. I had so many ideas for how to build an amazing life on that land. If only I had paid attention to the details.**

---

**At the end of the day, after carrying dozens of boxes into the house, I was exhausted.**

**I decided to drive into town, find a place to eat, relax a little.**

**As I passed by Ti√£o‚Äôs house, the sun was already setting.**

**A lamp was lit out front.**

**Wait. No electricity?**

**Maybe I could set up a power line so he could tap into my energy grid.**

**But‚Ä¶ 3 kilometers of wiring?**

**Not happening.**

**I stopped at a gas station by the roadside to fill up before reaching town.**

**Gas was ridiculously expensive there.**

**I had never stopped before. Not worth it.**

**Better to drive a little further and fill up in the city.**

**But‚Ä¶ what if I ran out of gas out here, at night?**

**I‚Äôd be waiting forever for assistance.**

**And worst case scenario?**

**I‚Äôd make some new friends.**

**An old, grumpy-looking gas attendant approached.**

**I struck up a conversation:**

**‚Äî Good evening. Fill it up for me? Just moved in. I‚Äôm staying on Estrada da Jurema.**

**‚Äî Good evening. Regular or premium?**

**‚Äî Regular‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs pretty isolated out there, huh? Just me and Ti√£o.**

**The old man gave me a disgusted look.**

**Then, without warning:**

**‚Äî Fill up your own damn car.**

**‚Äî Or better yet, don‚Äôt. Get the hell out of here and go bother someone else.**

**He turned his back on me and walked away.**

**What the fuck?**

**Does this guy hate engineers?**

**Did he think I was arrogant?**

**Or was I just another city idiot thinking I could escape stress in the countryside?**

**I started the car, still confused.**

**When I got to the center of town, I filled up at another station and mentioned the incident to the attendant.**

**He just shrugged.**

**‚Äî Don‚Äôt mind him, Doc. That old man is Z√© from the gas station. He used to be rich, but now he‚Äôs just stuck there, bitter.**

**He chuckled.**

**‚Äî Nobody stops there anymore. He waters down the gas.**

**I almost corrected him. Gas and water don‚Äôt mix.**

**But... fuck it.**

**Better to just get home.**

**I wasn‚Äôt in the mood for a drink anymore.**

**Or for anything else in this town.**

---


# I arrive at the mansion.

I open the gate with a remote control‚Äî**a small automation more than deserved.**

I park right at the entrance.

As I turn the key to unlock the door, I notice **something hanging from the wooden beam of the porch.**

A **necklace.**

It‚Äôs brown, made of **stones.**

Or... does it lean more toward **red**?

The stones aren‚Äôt perfectly round‚Äî**their edges are slightly jagged, but smooth enough to look polished over time.**

They‚Äôre strung together with **twine**, something **rustic, natural.**

**Handmade, for sure.**

Probably **one of the workers left it behind** while finishing up the renovation.

I walk into the kitchen, toss the necklace in the trash, grab something to eat, spend some time online, and go to bed.

# The next morning.

I wake up early, ready to enjoy my **first full day in the house.**

Between one thing and another, a thought crosses my mind‚Äî

**Maybe one of the workers will come back for that damn necklace.**

I go check the trash can.

**The necklace isn‚Äôt there.**

**Shit.**

I must‚Äôve left it somewhere else.

I rummage through my things, checking every obvious spot.

**Nothing.**

**Fuck it.**

If someone asks about it, I‚Äôll just pay for another one, give them a few bucks, and be done with it.

# I decide to explore my empire.

My head is spinning with **ideas.**

So much potential.

So many things to build.

So many things to create.

When I reach the **chicken coop**, something feels... off.

In the **old slaughterhouse**, there‚Äôs a **dead animal.**

A **rabbit.**

Lying on the ground, **its belly split open.**

It must be a **tapiti**, a native rabbit from this region.

Hard to find.

Probably got **cornered by a possum** inside the slaughterhouse.

The floor **is stained with blood.**

I clean up the area, **get rid of the carcass.**

(**Do I need to bury it?**)

And then, I **shiver.**

Just outside the slaughterhouse, on **the stone path**, I notice **a bloody footprint.**

Roughly **the same size as mine.**

I shake my head.

**Stop it.**

**You‚Äôre overthinking.**

I must have stepped in the blood while cleaning and tracked it outside.

Now I‚Äôm **standing here alone, making shit up in my head.**

I decide to **bury the rabbit.**

I dig a small hole **near the slaughterhouse**, drop the carcass in, and cover it with dirt.

But the **footprint bothers me.**

I make a mental note to **wipe it away later.**

# Later that day.

I go back to clean the **stone path**, wiping away the dried blood.

It‚Äôs not much, but **I don‚Äôt need unnecessary scares every time I walk by.**

Then, I notice **something I missed before.**

**The trail doesn‚Äôt stop here.**

The faint **blood stains continue.**

Leading toward **the stream.**

**Three more footprints.**

Then the trail fades.

But the **direction is clear.**

**The stream.**

# I follow it.

I enter a **narrow trail through the forest**, leading to **the abandoned cabin.**

As I walk, **my mind has already solved the mystery.**

**Some idiot must be hunting illegally around here.**

The bastard **crossed the stream to get his prey**, which had wandered onto my property.

He was **probably in the middle of gutting it** when **something spooked him.**

**He ran.**

Didn‚Äôt even notice **he left a blood trail behind.**

I‚Äôm going to install **an outdoor camera.**

Maybe even **some sirens** to scare off anyone who thinks they can sneak in here.

# I reach the stream and scan the area.

**The cabin, the trail, the surroundings‚Ä¶**

**Nothing.**

**Out of the corner of my eye, I notice something on the other side of the river.**

**But from where I stand, I can‚Äôt see it clearly.**

**Fuck it.**

**Let‚Äôs get my boots wet and check it out.**

**I cross the stream and walk toward it.**

**It‚Äôs just an old piece of cloth.**

**But when I unfold it‚Äî**

**the necklace is there.**

**Drenched in dried blood.**

# I‚Äôm a goddamn engineer.

**The necklace did not teleport here.**

**This must be another one.**

**The same hunter who left this here was probably the one who forgot the first one at my front door.**

**That will all make perfect sense‚Ä¶**

**As soon as I find the first necklace.**

**I pick up the old cloth with the necklace, head back to the mansion, and try to make sense of all this.**

# As I approach the house, I notice someone standing at the gate.

**It‚Äôs Ti√£o.**

**From a distance, I motion for him to come in.**

**But he doesn‚Äôt.**

**He just shakes his head.**

**‚Äî Doc, come here for a second.**

**I walk up to the gate.**

**Ti√£o greets me with a smile, always friendly.**

**‚Äî How are you, Doc? Thanks again for the fruit, by the way.**

**He hesitates for a second.**

**Then, almost casually:**

**‚Äî Listen‚Ä¶ Would you mind if I come onto your property now and then? Just to fish in the stream?**

**‚Äî The part that runs through your land has some big lambaris. Sometimes even a nice fat tra√≠ra.**

I shrug.

‚Äî **Ti√£o, the house is yours.** Come whenever you want, no need for formalities.

But **something feels off.**

I take the opportunity.

‚Äî **Let me ask you something‚Ä¶ I think someone was here last night.**

‚Äî **I found a dead rabbit in the slaughterhouse.**

‚Äî **And some footprints.**

Ti√£o **shrugs like it‚Äôs nothing.**

‚Äî **Oh, Doc, people from town come hunting around here all the time.**

‚Äî **It‚Äôs really common, you know?**

‚Äî **Get a dog. That‚Äôll keep the fools from sneaking in.**

He then notices **the necklace in my hand.**

His expression **changes slightly.**

I lift the necklace.

‚Äî **Look what I found, Ti√£o. Must belong to the hunter who came through here.**

Ti√£o **frowns.**

‚Äî **Oh, Doc‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs macumba.**¬†

***Note***\*: ""Macumba"" is a term sometimes used in Brazil to refer to Afro-Brazilian spiritual practices, often involving rituals, offerings, and protection against supernatural forces.\*

‚Äî **It‚Äôs not good to keep things like that around.**

‚Äî **Throw it away. It only attracts bad things.**

He pauses, eyes fixed on the necklace, like **it deeply unsettles him.**

‚Äî **Look, I won‚Äôt touch that, but I can grab it by the cloth and get rid of it for you.**

He **reaches out for the amulet.**

**But my hand pulls back.**

**Instinctively.**

**Why?**

I play it off.

‚Äî **Come on, Ti√£o. I‚Äôm not going to let you throw away my trash.**

I force a smile.

‚Äî **I‚Äôll handle it.**

‚Äî **I need to set something up to scare off that hunter who came through here anyway.**

Ti√£o **nods with his usual smile.**

‚Äî **No problem, Doc. Just call if you need anything.**

‚Äî **And thanks for letting me onto the property.**

I give him a casual wave.

‚Äî **The house is yours!**

---

I step inside, grab my truck keys, and head into town.

**I need to figure this out.**

I want to buy **a camera, some security devices, and a few tools.**

**I‚Äôm going to catch this hunter red-handed.**

But the **town has nothing.**

The **only** electronics store is tiny, filled with **outdated, useless equipment.**

I chat briefly with the clerk, but it‚Äôs clear‚Äî

**I won‚Äôt find what I need here.**

But he does give me a suggestion:

‚Äî **If you're worried about security, get a dog.**

‚Äî **My cousin has a kennel here in town. He breeds and sells to S√£o Paulo. He might have a trained one for you.**

# The idea of being at the mercy of some stranger who could walk into my property didn‚Äôt sit well with me.

**But having a dog?**

**That...**

**That seemed like a much better option than being defenseless.**

**I head to the kennel the clerk mentioned and introduce myself to the owner, a guy named Gabriel.**

**I explain my situation‚Äîeverything that happened.**

**He listens, shakes his head, and comments:**

**‚Äî Damn. Never thought anyone would actually buy the mansion on Estrada da Jurema.**

**‚Äî When we were kids, we used to play around there all the time.**

**‚Äî The old folks say it‚Äôs haunted. And honestly? No one goes there at night.**

**He chuckles.**

**But then, his tone shifts slightly.**

**‚Äî To be real with you, though‚Ä¶ that place was caught up in some endless inheritance dispute.**

**‚Äî Legally, it couldn‚Äôt be sold for decades.**

**‚Äî So people just made up ghost stories to explain why it stayed abandoned for so long.**

**‚Äî Really? I had no idea. ‚Äî I say absentmindedly, barely registering his words.**

**‚Äî I bought it for the isolation. For the peace and quiet.**

**Gabriel smirks.**

**‚Äî Oh, you‚Äôll definitely get peace and quiet out there.**

**‚Äî The heir to the place is Dona Firmina. You must‚Äôve bought it from her.**

**I freeze for a second.**

**Dona Firmina?**

**I had never heard that name before.**

**I bought the mansion through a judicial auction but...**

**Gabriel keeps talking:**

**‚Äî Dona Firmina‚Äôs old now. Lost her mind in that place and ended up in an asylum‚Ä¶**

**‚Äî WHAT?!**

**My voice comes out louder than I intended.**

**Gabriel bursts out laughing.**

**‚Äî Nah, just messing with you, man.**

**‚Äî She still lives in town. She‚Äôs doing fine, despite her age.**

**‚Äî Totally sane, no asylum.**

**‚Äî In fact, when word got out that the mansion had sold, people started hitting her up for loans.**

**‚Äî But with all the debts she had, she barely saw any of the money.**

**He says this like it‚Äôs just another trivial detail.**

**After chatting some more, I realize a puppy wouldn‚Äôt be much help.**

**So Gabriel sells me Brutus‚Äî**

**A massive, fully trained German Shepherd.**

**If I hadn‚Äôt been told otherwise, I‚Äôd swear this thing was part wolf.**

**I spend about two hours getting familiar with Brutus.**

**Despite his sheer size, he‚Äôs incredibly gentle.**

**But before I leave, Gabriel gives me a warning:**

**‚Äî Don‚Äôt get too comfortable, Doc.**

**‚Äî He‚Äôs playful now. But if you give the command‚Ä¶**

**‚Äî He could rip someone‚Äôs arm clean off.**

---


# The whole ordeal of getting a dog took up my entire day.

**It was already getting dark when I drove back to the mansion, Brutus in the truck bed.**

**As we passed Ti√£o‚Äôs house, I noticed something.**

**The old oil lamp was lit.**

**No electricity.**

**Poor guy.**

**Can‚Äôt be easy living like that.**

**Maybe I should insist on helping.**

**No one was at the door.**

**But Brutus noticed something.**

**Without warning, he started barking like mad toward Ti√£o‚Äôs house.**

**My heart jumped.**

**What the hell?**

**I stepped on the gas.**

**I didn‚Äôt want to bother Ti√£o with Brutus's barking.**

# Back home.

**Brutus did what any dog would do‚Äîhe tried to walk into the mansion with me.**

**I ignored him.**

**I stored the dog food I bought from Gabriel, set up water and kibble outside, and walked inside.**

**Brutus let out a small whimper, grumbled a bit, but I didn‚Äôt care.**

**The whole point of him being here was to protect the property.**

**He needed to stay outside.**

**I made myself dinner, wasted some time on the internet, and went to bed.**

# I should have paid attention to his behavior.

**But I didn‚Äôt.**

---


# 7:00 AM.

**I woke up feeling well-rested.**

**I got dressed.**

**And that‚Äôs when I felt it.**

**The necklace I had found by the stream was still in my shirt pocket.**

**Weird.**

**I had completely forgotten about it.**

**I went looking for the first necklace.**

**But it was nowhere to be found.**

**I ended up washing the one I had and, without thinking much about it, put it back in my pocket.**

**I wanted to go online and research more about it.**

**But something unsettled me.**

**I needed to check on Brutus.**

**I opened the front door.**

**And my breakfast nearly came back up.**

---


# The entrance of the house was drenched in blood.

**Right in front of the mansion‚Äî**

**A dog‚Äôs severed paw.**

**Probably Brutus‚Äôs.**

**Blood trails stretched across the ground.**

**My head spun.**

**I followed the trails.**

**And then‚Äî**

**I found pieces of Brutus scattered everywhere.**

# His head was behind the small chapel, on the highest part of the property.

**Behind the chapel, I noticed holes in the ground.**

**Had Brutus been digging?**

**Or had something else started digging?**

**I took a step closer.**

**And then I saw them.**

**Small. Old. Gravestones.**

# This wasn‚Äôt a normal cemetery.

**It was a secluded part of the property.**

**A place reserved for the dead.**

# But that can wait.

**Let the dead stay where they are.**

**The real problem is my goddamn dog.**

**It must have been a jaguar.**

**I should have listened to Ti√£o.**

**I should have been more careful with the wildlife.**

**Running around the property, under the scorching sun, searching for Brutus‚Äôs remains, left me dizzy.**

**I sat down for a moment.**

**Maybe it was the stress.**

**Maybe it was the fear.**

**Fear of a jaguar?**

**They‚Äôre nocturnal.**

**There‚Äôs no way one would attack me now.**

**Then what the fuck am I afraid of?**

**Ghosts? They don‚Äôt exist.**

**Corpses? They‚Äôre already dead.**

**What harm can they do? What, give me an infection?**

**My vision darkens.**

# I black out.

# I wake up in the middle of the afternoon.

**I‚Äôm dirty.**

**Lying on top of one of the graves.**

**My nails are caked with dirt.**

**And bleeding.**

**Looks like I was digging.**

**Desperately.**

**Futilely.**

**Probably the shock of seeing Brutus like that triggered something in my psyche.**

# I get up.

**I go back to the mansion.**

**I take a shower.**

**I get dressed.**

**I pack a bag.**

**I need to find someone to kill that jaguar.**

**Until that happens, I can‚Äôt sleep here.**

**I need to find a hotel.**

**I‚Äôll come back tomorrow morning with someone to‚Äî**

**I don‚Äôt know.**

**Set traps?**

**Fence the property?**

**Do something.**

**Fucking nature.**

**I wasn‚Äôt expecting a jaguar.**

**My head keeps spinning.**

**I‚Äôm seething over Brutus‚Äôs death.**

**But‚Ä¶**

**Was that really the only thing bothering me?**

# It‚Äôs late afternoon.

**I can‚Äôt find a hotel.**

**Just a small inn, a little far from the town center.**

**Looks like a simple place.**

**Which makes sense.**

**Who the hell would come visit this nowhere town?**

**An old Black woman runs the place.**

**I explain that I had a domestic accident and need to stay somewhere else for the night until I sort things out.**

**I‚Äôd rather not go into details. Trying to explain everything to this woman‚Ä¶**

**But she just looks at me.**

**Her voice is calm. Steady.**

**‚Äî Son, go rest. Get some sleep. You seem agitated.**

**‚Äî Here, you are protected.**

---

**Protected from what, exactly?**

**I think about asking.**

**But I drop it.**

**The adrenaline was fading.**

**I needed to sleep.**

# And sleep, I did.

---


# I wake up in my room at the inn.

I glance at the clock.

**It‚Äôs 11:30 PM.**

**Silence.**

Then, I hear **voices.**

Coming from **the back of the property.**

**The smell of burning wood.**

A **bonfire?**

The voices **aren‚Äôt clear.**

**Something feels off.**

I get up and move **through the darkness**, still inside the inn.

I stop near **a window facing the back.**

I slowly pull the curtain aside.

**And I start to watch.**

# At the far end of the property, hidden among the shadows, a few people were gathered.

A‚Ä¶ **terreiro \*?**¬†

***Note***\*: A ""terreiro"" is a sacred space where such rituals take place, often linked to religions like Candombl√© or Umbanda. In Brazilian folklore, these places are sometimes seen as connected to spirits, both good and bad‚Äîespecially in horror stories.\*

Honestly, **I don‚Äôt even know what to call this shit.**

All I know is that **people who are out of touch with reality think they can talk to the dead in places like this.**

**All I need right now is a hunter.**

Someone to go there and **take down a wild animal.**

Preferably **without involving the authorities.**

**And instead, the universe sticks me in a rundown inn with some kind of spirit-calling bullshit in the backyard?**

**Fuck this.**

I decide to grab my things and leave.

I‚Äôll come back **in the morning to pay for the night.**

I quietly close the curtain.

I turn around **slowly.**

And a **shiver** runs from the base of my spine to my neck.

---


# She‚Äôs there.

The old woman.

**Watching me.**

‚Äî **Son, you‚Äôre not well.**

Her tone is **calm.**

**Almost maternal.**

‚Äî **You‚Äôre the young man who bought Dona Firmina‚Äôs house, aren‚Äôt you?**

Her eyes **seem to see past me.**

‚Äî **Don‚Äôt you want to tell me what‚Äôs going on?**

I **swallow dry.**

‚Äî **Look, ma‚Äôam, I don‚Äôt mean to be rude, but honestly, no.**

Or rather‚Ä¶

To be **totally honest**, I really just need **a hunter.**

‚Äî **There‚Äôs a jaguar on my property.**

‚Äî **It killed my dog.**

‚Äî **And if I want to have my peace back, I need to get rid of that thing.**

I force an awkward chuckle.

‚Äî **So, if you don‚Äôt mind‚Ä¶ Unless you happen to know a hunter that works 24 hours.**

She **stares at me** for a moment that lasts **too long.**

Then, she **speaks, calmly.**

‚Äî **Of course, son. If that‚Äôs what you want, go ahead.**

She pauses.

Then, with **absolute certainty** in her voice, she adds:

‚Äî **But I‚Äôd bet anything that the one who killed your dog‚Ä¶**

She tilts her head slightly.

‚Äî **Was you.**

---


# My body turns cold.

That statement, **completely disconnected from reality,** sends a wave of terror through me.

‚Äî **Look‚Ä¶ We don‚Äôt know each other, but I‚Äôve never even killed a damn ant.**

My voice comes out **sharper than I intended.**

‚Äî **Let alone a dog I paid good money for.**

I pause.

Then I add:

‚Äî **You‚Äôre probably saying this to extort me.**

‚Äî **To blackmail me with some kind of animal cruelty accusation or something‚Ä¶**

She lets out a slow sigh.

Then, in **a hushed voice**:

‚Äî **Son‚Ä¶**

Her tone is more **sad than accusatory.**

‚Äî **You don‚Äôt see it.**

**But I do.**

‚Äî **He‚Äôs right behind you.**

‚Äî **Laughing.**

‚Äî **Waiting for just one more night.**

She **pauses.**

Then, she **smiles softly.**

‚Äî **When you decide to believe me‚Ä¶ call me.**

Her voice is **steady, confident.**

‚Äî **I‚Äôll be here waiting.**

# My heart starts racing.

‚Äî **Alright, alright, alright.**

I reach into my pocket and pull out a bill.

I throw it onto the floor.

‚Äî **Here. That covers my stay.**

My voice comes out **more unsteady than I‚Äôd like.**

‚Äî **Now, if you don‚Äôt mind‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd like to leave.**

I **walk out fast.**

# I‚Äôm not going back to the mansion.

I don‚Äôt want to deal with **a jaguar.**

But I‚Äôm **sure as hell not sleeping in this place.**

**No fucking way.**

---


# Maybe I should drive to a bigger town.

**Find a real hotel.**

**But no.**

**I feel too exhausted.**

**I drive to a gas station.**

**Lock the car.**

**Recline the driver‚Äôs seat.**

**And sleep.**

---


# 10:00 AM.

**I wake up with the sun burning my face.**

**Unshaven.**

**Mouth dry, breath awful.**

**I reach for a mint in the car‚Äôs console.**

**Nothing.**

**I must look like absolute shit.**

# I drive back to the mansion.

**I pass by Brutus‚Äôs remains.**

**The stench is unbearable now.**

**Dried blood everywhere.**

**I step inside and lock the door.**

**I need to pull myself together.**

**But I can‚Äôt think straight.**

**I‚Äôm not even hungry.**

# I collapse onto the couch.

**And sleep again.**

---


# I wake up in the stream.

**No boots.**

**Feet wet.**

# The sun looks low.

**It must be around 5:00 PM.**

**Something is happening to me.**

**This must be stress-induced.**

**Some kind of physiological response.**

**A form of sleepwalking.**

# I grab my phone.

**I need to call someone.**

**I need medical attention.**

# No signal.

**Goddamn forest.**

**I climb up to the chapel, on the highest part of the property.**

**The signal should work there.**

**I walk barefoot, my feet scraping against the rocks.**

**I reach the top.**

**Still no signal.**

# But there is something inside the chapel.

**I move closer, carefully.**

**I peek inside.**

---


# Candles.

**Lit.**

# In the center of the chapel, a clay bowl.

**Inside it, rotting entrails.**

**Brutus‚Äôs, maybe?**

**I walk toward the back of the chapel.**

**The broken tombstones are still there.**

**But they‚Äôve been rearranged.**

**The stones now spell out names.**

**Dona Isolda Salgado, 1822 - 1854**

**Julieta Salgado, 1844 - 1854**

**Astolfo Salgado, 1843 - 1854**

**Sebasti√£o Salgado, 1801 - 1854**

# I lose my breath.

**They all died the same year.**

**I find myself whispering out loud:**

**‚Äî Who the hell arranged this?**

# A shiver runs down my spine.

---

**A voice behind me.**

**Soft.**

**But cutting.**

**‚Äî You, son.**

**‚Äî It‚Äôs all you.**

# I spin around instinctively.

**The old woman from the inn.**

**She‚Äôs not alone.**

**Beside her, another woman.**

**Just as old.**

**Maybe older.**

**And a young man.**

**Black. Strong. Built.**

# Adrenaline surges through my body.

**I shout:**

**‚Äî What the fuck are you doing here?!**

**She remains calm.**

**‚Äî Calm down. Listen to me for five minutes.**

**‚Äî If after that you want us gone, we‚Äôll leave.**

**‚Äî And we‚Äôll never come back.**

# I grit my teeth.

**My hands tremble.**

**My breathing is heavy.**

**‚Äî Fine.**

**I take a deep breath.**

**‚Äî Five minutes.**

**I say, impatient.**

---


**She proceeds, serious:**

**‚Äî Before I tell you anything, you need to say these exact words: ""I revoke my permission.""**

**I recoil.**

**‚Äî Permission for what?**

**My voice comes out sharper than I intended.**

**She hardens her gaze.**

**‚Äî SAY IT NOW!**

**She shouts.**

**‚Äî Fine, fine!**

**‚Äî I revoke my permission. Happy?**

**I say it impatiently.**

# Relief is immediate on their faces.

**But before I can even begin to process what just happened‚Äî**

**The old woman turns to the young man and orders:**

**‚Äî Jo√£o, now. Make him throw it up.**

# What?!

**Before I can react, Jo√£o grabs me.**

**His grip is unbelievably strong.**

**He presses my stomach with a force that shouldn‚Äôt be possible.**

**My ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù engineer physique doesn‚Äôt stand a chance.**

**I vomit.**

# And chunks of raw, rotting entrails spill from my mouth.

**(Brutus?)**

**My body shakes.**

**The stench is unbearable.**

**My mind refuses to accept what my eyes are seeing.**

# The old woman looks at me again.

**Her voice is cold. Precise. Irrefutable.**

**‚Äî This woman next to me is Dona Firmina.**

**‚Äî She‚Äôs the great-niece of Dona Isolda.**

**‚Äî The grave you were lying on? That was hers.**

**‚Äî And I‚Ä¶**

**She pauses.**

**As if debating whether she should go on.**

**Then, she does.**

**‚Äî I am the great-granddaughter of the slave that family owned.**

**I feel my heartbeat accelerate.**

**She doesn‚Äôt blink.**

**She continues:**

**‚Äî Dr. Salgado was obsessed with Dona Isolda.**

**‚Äî He was a jealous man. Possessive.**

**‚Äî But more than that‚Ä¶ he was fascinated by the rituals of my ancestors.**

**‚Äî In his madness, he sought a way to live forever‚Äî**

**‚Äî By Isolda‚Äôs side.**

# The chapel feels smaller.

**The air thicker.**

**The old woman doesn‚Äôt stop.**

**‚Äî After years of searching, he found a slave who promised him a ritual.**

**‚Äî A ritual for eternal life.**

**She shakes her head.**

**‚Äî I don‚Äôt know what that man was planning. Don‚Äôt ask me.**

**‚Äî But that ritual‚Ä¶**

**She pauses.**

**‚Äî Dr. Salgado murdered his entire family.**

**‚Äî Then he killed himself.**

**‚Äî Right here. In this very chapel.**

# Silence hangs in the air.

**But the old woman still isn‚Äôt finished.**

**‚Äî The promise that man made to him?**

**‚Äî It worked.**

**‚Äî Salgado achieved eternal life.**

**‚Äî But not as a man.**

**‚Äî He became something worse.**

**‚Äî He still exists.**

**‚Äî But he survives as a demon, by taking the bodies of the living.**

# My breath quickens.

---

**But she doesn‚Äôt stop.**

**‚Äî My great-grandmother wouldn‚Äôt let that happen to Isolda.**

**‚Äî She banished Dr. Salgado‚Äôs soul from this land.**

**‚Äî And without access to his remains‚Ä¶**

**‚Äî The ritual became useless.**

# The old woman takes a deep breath.

Then, she **drops the final piece of the puzzle**:

‚Äî **In some way, you‚Äôve already met Dr. Salgado.**

‚Äî **Maybe by another name.**

‚Äî **Sebasti√£o Salgado.**

# My blood turns to ice.

---

**Ti√£o. Short for Sebasti√£o.**

---

The old woman **continues, unwavering**:

‚Äî **He and his family haunt this region, beyond the limits of this land.**

‚Äî **He as the tormentor.**

‚Äî **His wife and children as his victims.**

‚Äî **And you‚Ä¶**

‚Äî **You let him in.**

‚Äî **You gave him access to his remains.**

‚Äî **And he nearly took over your body.**

‚Äî **He almost cast your soul into the abyss.**

# The weight of her words crushes me.

And then, she tilts her head.

She **studies me.**

Like she‚Äôs trying to **figure something out.**

Something **even she doesn‚Äôt understand.**

‚Äî **But what intrigues me the most‚Ä¶**

She squints slightly.

‚Äî **‚Ä¶ is how you‚Äôre still here.**

‚Äî **Something has been protecting you.**

‚Äî **And neither you nor I know what it is.**

‚Äî **If you ever find out‚Ä¶ be grateful.**

‚Äî **Because by now‚Ä¶**

She takes a slow breath.

‚Äî **You should have already been lost.**

---

# My head pounds.

---

I **force my mind** to process everything.

But it‚Äôs **impossible.**

So I say **the only thing I can manage**:

‚Äî **Wait.**

My voice **trembles slightly.**

‚Äî **I admit‚Ä¶ this is all absurdly confusing.**

I pause.

‚Äî **But I met Ti√£o.**

‚Äî **He‚Äôs my neighbor.**

‚Äî **I saw his family.**

‚Äî **I shook his hand.**

‚Äî **How can they be the ""ghosts"" you claim‚Ä¶ if they‚Äôre alive just a few kilometers away?**

‚Äî **It doesn‚Äôt make sense!**

The old woman **smiles.**

But it‚Äôs **not just any smile.**

It‚Äôs a **smile full of compassion. And pity.**

‚Äî **Then why don‚Äôt you go visit them?**

She turns to Jo√£o and Dona Firmina.

‚Äî **Take him there.**

‚Äî **I‚Äôll stay behind to undo the ritual.**

---


# I don‚Äôt hesitate.

I get into my truck.

Jo√£o and Dona Firmina follow in **an old, battered car.**

**I‚Äôm going to prove them wrong.**

# We drive fast to Ti√£o‚Äôs house.

The **wattle and daub shack** he called home.

We step out.

I **walk straight to the house.**

**Door closed.**

**Windows shut.**

They follow close behind.

I knock.

**Once.**

**Twice.**

**Three times.**

# Nothing.

The door is **unlocked.**

I push it open.

I turn on my **phone‚Äôs flashlight** and shine it inside.

# Cobwebs.

**Dust.**

**Filth.**

# This place hasn‚Äôt been lived in for years.

Then, in the middle of what should have been the living room, **something makes my breath hitch.**

A **basket of fruit.**

**Rotten.**

---

# My basket of fruit.

---

I step outside. **Pale.**

My **whole body trembles.**

Jo√£o and Dona Firmina **look at me with sympathy.**

**They know.**

# Now, I understand.

There is **no denying it anymore.**

Maybe I will **never be the same again.**

# Then, my eyes drift to my truck.

And **my heart stops.**

# Ti√£o is there.

Leaning against it.

**Staring at me.**

# The same smile.

**The smile that never changed.**

Like he **knows.**

Like he **knows exactly what just happened.**

Like he **knows‚Ä¶**

# That this was just the beginning.

**My breath catches.**

I scream.

‚Äî **HE! RIGHT THERE! YOU SEE HIM?!**

Dona Firmina **doesn‚Äôt even look.**

She just sighs.

And **calmly** says:

‚Äî **Son‚Ä¶**

She looks straight into my eyes.

‚Äî **There‚Äôs no one there.**

# Prologue

I‚Äôm in my old apartment in S√£o Paulo, writing this down.

I left that place **yesterday.**

A truck took all my belongings.

I was the last to leave, carrying only my personal items.

I left **the necklace** exactly where I found it‚Äî

Tied to the roof beam, where it was.

As I drove away, through the rearview mirror,

I saw him.

# Ti√£o.

Leaning against the gate.

With that **same sinister smile.**

I hope he stays there.

And I pray he **doesn‚Äôt follow me here.**",3,1740275508.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Call center sa gabi and student sa umaga, walang tulogan talaga yun bali yung tulog ko na iinsert lang sa byahe. Ganun routine ko for almost 3 years. So masasabi niyo talaga na kaya talaga ng katawan ko mag puyat and gising for 24 hours or kahit one week before day off na 1-3 hours lang ang tulog putol-putol pa. 

Pero ngayon na wala na akong work and graduated na, taking board exam nalang. Di ko na kaya huhu suspect ko naniningil na ng tulog katawan ko.

Previous Attempts: Tried drinking coffee and cold water hindi na siya effective. Di rin ako pwede mag power nap in between my study dahil tendency umaga na ako magigising. Wala din effect sa akin ang alarm dahil automatic pinapatay ng katawan ko yung alarm or minsan di ko naririnig. One time nag alarm ako and di ako nagising sa alarm, pagka umagahan off na phone ko. Automatic yung katawan ko pinapatay yung sound or tawag basta tulog ako then unconscious. Para siyang reflex ganun huhu.

I‚Äôm driving, from WNY to Orlando, I had chat GPT build me an itinerary for local coffee roasters about every 3 hours along with a couple roadside attractions along the way. 
A bulk of my immediate family is renting a house outside of the bubble. I got myself a room at ASS. So I am doing 2 days in the park with my family, 
It was kind of a last minute trip for me. 
I grew up at WDW. My parents, who are now in their 80‚Äôs, have been talking an annual trip to WDW for just about every year since the mid 90‚Äôs. My parents love EPCOT. We have so many great memories together there that when he mentioned that this was probably going to be their last trip I knew I had to go and make sure I just soak in the warm sun and be a literal adult child and go to Disney for probably last time with my Mom and Dad. 
I have not been able to do the annual family trip in over 20 years.  I Almost got to do an MK day in 2022 but I got Covid the day I arrived in FL and was confined to a room for a week. 
Well that was a fun word vomit! 
So it‚Äôs actually kind of ironic that they are going this late in the year as 12 years ago I missed the trip because I checked myself into rehab, good lord willing I will have 12 years sobriety from Alcohol on March 16th. 
I am excited to be able to be in a place where I can plan the whole thing out and book a trip on my own and do what I want! I have a great job where I work remotely and can literally work from anywhere. 
But I am on vacation, so if I don‚Äôt feel like rushing the drive home I can always work remotely and take my time exploring. 
Thanks for letting me vent.

If you have any doubts about the cultural context, feel free to ask, and I‚Äôll do my best to explain.

I just want to **leave this experience behind.**

---

My name is Fernando. I‚Äôm just another IT executive who got tired of the stress of big corporations and decided to retire. Not because my body asked for it, but because my mind demanded it. I just needed to rest, let time pass quietly, and avoid crashing head-on into the burnout train.

I‚Äôm not married, I don‚Äôt have kids, which, I confess, made it easier to take a sharp turn like this: I bought a rural property in the countryside and moved there. My plan was simple‚Äîstudy, enjoy the video games my exhausting work routine never allowed, read, and reflect a bit.

I found the perfect property, about **30 km from the city center**. A dirt road, isolated, exactly what I was looking for. I invested a good amount of money to bring in **renewable energy and water**. I also spent a chunk of my savings to give a **serious facelift** to the house that was already there: **a huge old colonial mansion, extremely spacious but falling apart.**

During my trips to check on the renovation, I met my neighbor, **Ti√£o**. A rugged man who lived with his wife and two young children in **a wattle and daub house**, about **5 km from my property**. Other than Ti√£o‚Äôs house, there was **nothing else on that side of the Tiet√™ River**. I was told it was **a protected area**, so nobody bought land there because **it couldn‚Äôt be legally developed**.

But **Ti√£o lived there, strong and steady.**

One late afternoon, I stopped my truck in front of his house.

He seemed **friendly**, came out to greet me, but his wife and kids stayed at the window, **watching me, hesitant**.

Our conversation, as I remember it, went something like this:

‚Äî **Good afternoon. I bought the mansion at the end of Estrada da Jurema. How‚Äôs it going?**

‚Äî **Good afternoon. You‚Äôre gonna like the area.** My name‚Äôs **Ti√£o**, and inside are my wife and kids. **We don‚Äôt get many visitors, so they‚Äôre a bit wary of stepping outside.**

‚Äî **My name‚Äôs Fernando. I brought a box of fruit for the neighbors.** ‚Äî I handed him the box.

‚Äî **That wasn‚Äôt necessary, sir. But I appreciate it.** Phone signal‚Äôs weak here, but if you ever need anything and I can help, just let me know.

He hesitated, then added:

‚Äî **Look, I don‚Äôt mean to be rude, but it‚Äôs better we don‚Äôt stand here talking too long.** It‚Äôs getting dark, and **there are jaguars in this region.**

**Jaguars?**

‚Äî **Why don‚Äôt you come by earlier one day? We can have some coffee.**

‚Äî **Sounds good. I‚Äôll be stopping by the house next week and can drop by later, if that‚Äôs okay.**

Ti√£o‚Äôs face changed.

‚Äî **You‚Äôre not gonna tear down the mansion, are you?**

His tone was **completely different now.**

‚Äî **No, no, just a renovation to make it more livable.** But why? **Is something wrong?**

Ti√£o‚Äôs shoulders **relaxed slightly**.

‚Äî **Nothing, sir. I just like that house. Lots of memories there, that‚Äôs all.**

He seemed **relieved.**

**I had no idea that conversation was the beginning of my problems.**

---

# The renovation went smoothly.

The contractor mentioned that there was a high turnover of workers. Nobody wanted to spend the night there. Too isolated. No phone signal. No internet. Nothing. I made a mental note to install satellite internet. I wanted peace and quiet, but internet was as essential as coffee.

I kept the original layout of the house, with a few modifications. I merged two bedrooms into a large office. The largest bedroom became my master suite. The living room and kitchen were now open-concept. Inside, the house was modern and well-equipped.

From the outside, it was still the same old colonial mansion‚Äîonly now, extremely well-maintained.

There were other areas of the property that I didn‚Äôt touch. (I wasn‚Äôt made of money.) And maybe I could fix them up myself‚Äîa new hobby, perhaps.

On the highest point of the property, there was a small ancient chapel, completely falling apart.

A barn, just as old, in dire need of either a complete renovation or outright demolition.

I even considered getting rid of my truck and replacing it with horses. I kept that thought in the back of my mind.

There was also a small animal enclosure.

It looked like an old, abandoned chicken coop, where goats and other small animals had probably been kept in the past. The enclosure was connected to a small room that must have been used as a slaughterhouse.

But it had been a long, long time since any farm animals had been there‚Äîexcept for the rats and possums that probably scurried through the place now.

At the far end of the property, deep in the woods, there was a stream branch and an old ruined shack.

From its condition, I guessed it had once been a storage shed for fishing gear.

But now, it was just a rotting husk.

# With the renovation complete and the internet installed, it was the perfect retreat.

**The zombie apocalypse could happen, and nothing would change in my routine. Hell, I could even start planting something. My grocery trips would become even less frequent.**

**On the day I moved in, I was excited. I had so many ideas for how to build an amazing life on that land. If only I had paid attention to the details.**

---

**At the end of the day, after carrying dozens of boxes into the house, I was exhausted.**

**I decided to drive into town, find a place to eat, relax a little.**

**As I passed by Ti√£o‚Äôs house, the sun was already setting.**

**A lamp was lit out front.**

**Wait. No electricity?**

**Maybe I could set up a power line so he could tap into my energy grid.**

**But‚Ä¶ 3 kilometers of wiring?**

**Not happening.**

**I stopped at a gas station by the roadside to fill up before reaching town.**

**Gas was ridiculously expensive there.**

**I had never stopped before. Not worth it.**

**Better to drive a little further and fill up in the city.**

**But‚Ä¶ what if I ran out of gas out here, at night?**

**I‚Äôd be waiting forever for assistance.**

**And worst case scenario?**

**I‚Äôd make some new friends.**

**An old, grumpy-looking gas attendant approached.**

**I struck up a conversation:**

**‚Äî Good evening. Fill it up for me? Just moved in. I‚Äôm staying on Estrada da Jurema.**

**‚Äî Good evening. Regular or premium?**

**‚Äî Regular‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs pretty isolated out there, huh? Just me and Ti√£o.**

**The old man gave me a disgusted look.**

**Then, without warning:**

**‚Äî Fill up your own damn car.**

**‚Äî Or better yet, don‚Äôt. Get the hell out of here and go bother someone else.**

**He turned his back on me and walked away.**

**What the fuck?**

**Does this guy hate engineers?**

**Did he think I was arrogant?**

**Or was I just another city idiot thinking I could escape stress in the countryside?**

**I started the car, still confused.**

**When I got to the center of town, I filled up at another station and mentioned the incident to the attendant.**

**He just shrugged.**

**‚Äî Don‚Äôt mind him, Doc. That old man is Z√© from the gas station. He used to be rich, but now he‚Äôs just stuck there, bitter.**

**He chuckled.**

**‚Äî Nobody stops there anymore. He waters down the gas.**

**I almost corrected him. Gas and water don‚Äôt mix.**

**But... fuck it.**

**Better to just get home.**

**I wasn‚Äôt in the mood for a drink anymore.**

**Or for anything else in this town.**

---


# I arrive at the mansion.

I open the gate with a remote control‚Äî**a small automation more than deserved.**

I park right at the entrance.

As I turn the key to unlock the door, I notice **something hanging from the wooden beam of the porch.**

A **necklace.**

It‚Äôs brown, made of **stones.**

Or... does it lean more toward **red**?

The stones aren‚Äôt perfectly round‚Äî**their edges are slightly jagged, but smooth enough to look polished over time.**

They‚Äôre strung together with **twine**, something **rustic, natural.**

**Handmade, for sure.**

Probably **one of the workers left it behind** while finishing up the renovation.

I walk into the kitchen, toss the necklace in the trash, grab something to eat, spend some time online, and go to bed.

# The next morning.

I wake up early, ready to enjoy my **first full day in the house.**

Between one thing and another, a thought crosses my mind‚Äî

**Maybe one of the workers will come back for that damn necklace.**

I go check the trash can.

**The necklace isn‚Äôt there.**

**Shit.**

I must‚Äôve left it somewhere else.

I rummage through my things, checking every obvious spot.

**Nothing.**

**Fuck it.**

If someone asks about it, I‚Äôll just pay for another one, give them a few bucks, and be done with it.

# I decide to explore my empire.

My head is spinning with **ideas.**

So much potential.

So many things to build.

So many things to create.

When I reach the **chicken coop**, something feels... off.

In the **old slaughterhouse**, there‚Äôs a **dead animal.**

A **rabbit.**

Lying on the ground, **its belly split open.**

It must be a **tapiti**, a native rabbit from this region.

Hard to find.

Probably got **cornered by a possum** inside the slaughterhouse.

The floor **is stained with blood.**

I clean up the area, **get rid of the carcass.**

(**Do I need to bury it?**)

And then, I **shiver.**

Just outside the slaughterhouse, on **the stone path**, I notice **a bloody footprint.**

Roughly **the same size as mine.**

I shake my head.

**Stop it.**

**You‚Äôre overthinking.**

I must have stepped in the blood while cleaning and tracked it outside.

Now I‚Äôm **standing here alone, making shit up in my head.**

I decide to **bury the rabbit.**

I dig a small hole **near the slaughterhouse**, drop the carcass in, and cover it with dirt.

But the **footprint bothers me.**

I make a mental note to **wipe it away later.**

# Later that day.

I go back to clean the **stone path**, wiping away the dried blood.

It‚Äôs not much, but **I don‚Äôt need unnecessary scares every time I walk by.**

Then, I notice **something I missed before.**

**The trail doesn‚Äôt stop here.**

The faint **blood stains continue.**

Leading toward **the stream.**

**Three more footprints.**

Then the trail fades.

But the **direction is clear.**

**The stream.**

# I follow it.

I enter a **narrow trail through the forest**, leading to **the abandoned cabin.**

As I walk, **my mind has already solved the mystery.**

**Some idiot must be hunting illegally around here.**

The bastard **crossed the stream to get his prey**, which had wandered onto my property.

He was **probably in the middle of gutting it** when **something spooked him.**

**He ran.**

Didn‚Äôt even notice **he left a blood trail behind.**

I‚Äôm going to install **an outdoor camera.**

Maybe even **some sirens** to scare off anyone who thinks they can sneak in here.

# I reach the stream and scan the area.

**The cabin, the trail, the surroundings‚Ä¶**

**Nothing.**

**Out of the corner of my eye, I notice something on the other side of the river.**

**But from where I stand, I can‚Äôt see it clearly.**

**Fuck it.**

**Let‚Äôs get my boots wet and check it out.**

**I cross the stream and walk toward it.**

**It‚Äôs just an old piece of cloth.**

**But when I unfold it‚Äî**

**the necklace is there.**

**Drenched in dried blood.**

# I‚Äôm a goddamn engineer.

**The necklace did not teleport here.**

**This must be another one.**

**The same hunter who left this here was probably the one who forgot the first one at my front door.**

**That will all make perfect sense‚Ä¶**

**As soon as I find the first necklace.**

**I pick up the old cloth with the necklace, head back to the mansion, and try to make sense of all this.**

# As I approach the house, I notice someone standing at the gate.

**It‚Äôs Ti√£o.**

**From a distance, I motion for him to come in.**

**But he doesn‚Äôt.**

**He just shakes his head.**

**‚Äî Doc, come here for a second.**

**I walk up to the gate.**

**Ti√£o greets me with a smile, always friendly.**

**‚Äî How are you, Doc? Thanks again for the fruit, by the way.**

**He hesitates for a second.**

**Then, almost casually:**

**‚Äî Listen‚Ä¶ Would you mind if I come onto your property now and then? Just to fish in the stream?**

**‚Äî The part that runs through your land has some big lambaris. Sometimes even a nice fat tra√≠ra.**

I shrug.

‚Äî **Ti√£o, the house is yours.** Come whenever you want, no need for formalities.

But **something feels off.**

I take the opportunity.

‚Äî **Let me ask you something‚Ä¶ I think someone was here last night.**

‚Äî **I found a dead rabbit in the slaughterhouse.**

‚Äî **And some footprints.**

Ti√£o **shrugs like it‚Äôs nothing.**

‚Äî **Oh, Doc, people from town come hunting around here all the time.**

‚Äî **It‚Äôs really common, you know?**

‚Äî **Get a dog. That‚Äôll keep the fools from sneaking in.**

He then notices **the necklace in my hand.**

His expression **changes slightly.**

I lift the necklace.

‚Äî **Look what I found, Ti√£o. Must belong to the hunter who came through here.**

Ti√£o **frowns.**

‚Äî **Oh, Doc‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs macumba.**¬†

***Note***\*: ""Macumba"" is a term sometimes used in Brazil to refer to Afro-Brazilian spiritual practices, often involving rituals, offerings, and protection against supernatural forces.\*

‚Äî **It‚Äôs not good to keep things like that around.**

‚Äî **Throw it away. It only attracts bad things.**

He pauses, eyes fixed on the necklace, like **it deeply unsettles him.**

‚Äî **Look, I won‚Äôt touch that, but I can grab it by the cloth and get rid of it for you.**

He **reaches out for the amulet.**

**But my hand pulls back.**

**Instinctively.**

**Why?**

I play it off.

‚Äî **Come on, Ti√£o. I‚Äôm not going to let you throw away my trash.**

I force a smile.

‚Äî **I‚Äôll handle it.**

‚Äî **I need to set something up to scare off that hunter who came through here anyway.**

Ti√£o **nods with his usual smile.**

‚Äî **No problem, Doc. Just call if you need anything.**

‚Äî **And thanks for letting me onto the property.**

I give him a casual wave.

‚Äî **The house is yours!**

---

I step inside, grab my truck keys, and head into town.

**I need to figure this out.**

I want to buy **a camera, some security devices, and a few tools.**

**I‚Äôm going to catch this hunter red-handed.**

But the **town has nothing.**

The **only** electronics store is tiny, filled with **outdated, useless equipment.**

I chat briefly with the clerk, but it‚Äôs clear‚Äî

**I won‚Äôt find what I need here.**

But he does give me a suggestion:

‚Äî **If you're worried about security, get a dog.**

‚Äî **My cousin has a kennel here in town. He breeds and sells to S√£o Paulo. He might have a trained one for you.**

# The idea of being at the mercy of some stranger who could walk into my property didn‚Äôt sit well with me.

**But having a dog?**

**That...**

**That seemed like a much better option than being defenseless.**

**I head to the kennel the clerk mentioned and introduce myself to the owner, a guy named Gabriel.**

**I explain my situation‚Äîeverything that happened.**

**He listens, shakes his head, and comments:**

**‚Äî Damn. Never thought anyone would actually buy the mansion on Estrada da Jurema.**

**‚Äî When we were kids, we used to play around there all the time.**

**‚Äî The old folks say it‚Äôs haunted. And honestly? No one goes there at night.**

**He chuckles.**

**But then, his tone shifts slightly.**

**‚Äî To be real with you, though‚Ä¶ that place was caught up in some endless inheritance dispute.**

**‚Äî Legally, it couldn‚Äôt be sold for decades.**

**‚Äî So people just made up ghost stories to explain why it stayed abandoned for so long.**

**‚Äî Really? I had no idea. ‚Äî I say absentmindedly, barely registering his words.**

**‚Äî I bought it for the isolation. For the peace and quiet.**

**Gabriel smirks.**

**‚Äî Oh, you‚Äôll definitely get peace and quiet out there.**

**‚Äî The heir to the place is Dona Firmina. You must‚Äôve bought it from her.**

**I freeze for a second.**

**Dona Firmina?**

**I had never heard that name before.**

**I bought the mansion through a judicial auction but...**

**Gabriel keeps talking:**

**‚Äî Dona Firmina‚Äôs old now. Lost her mind in that place and ended up in an asylum‚Ä¶**

**‚Äî WHAT?!**

**My voice comes out louder than I intended.**

**Gabriel bursts out laughing.**

**‚Äî Nah, just messing with you, man.**

**‚Äî She still lives in town. She‚Äôs doing fine, despite her age.**

**‚Äî Totally sane, no asylum.**

**‚Äî In fact, when word got out that the mansion had sold, people started hitting her up for loans.**

**‚Äî But with all the debts she had, she barely saw any of the money.**

**He says this like it‚Äôs just another trivial detail.**

**After chatting some more, I realize a puppy wouldn‚Äôt be much help.**

**So Gabriel sells me Brutus‚Äî**

**A massive, fully trained German Shepherd.**

**If I hadn‚Äôt been told otherwise, I‚Äôd swear this thing was part wolf.**

**I spend about two hours getting familiar with Brutus.**

**Despite his sheer size, he‚Äôs incredibly gentle.**

**But before I leave, Gabriel gives me a warning:**

**‚Äî Don‚Äôt get too comfortable, Doc.**

**‚Äî He‚Äôs playful now. But if you give the command‚Ä¶**

**‚Äî He could rip someone‚Äôs arm clean off.**

# The whole ordeal of getting a dog took up my entire day.

**It was already getting dark when I drove back to the mansion, Brutus in the truck bed.**

**As we passed Ti√£o‚Äôs house, I noticed something.**

**The old oil lamp was lit.**

**No electricity.**

**Poor guy.**

**Can‚Äôt be easy living like that.**

**Maybe I should insist on helping.**

**No one was at the door.**

**But Brutus noticed something.**

**Without warning, he started barking like mad toward Ti√£o‚Äôs house.**

**My heart jumped.**

**What the hell?**

**I stepped on the gas.**

**I didn‚Äôt want to bother Ti√£o with Brutus's barking.**

# Back home.

**Brutus did what any dog would do‚Äîhe tried to walk into the mansion with me.**

**I ignored him.**

**I stored the dog food I bought from Gabriel, set up water and kibble outside, and walked inside.**

**Brutus let out a small whimper, grumbled a bit, but I didn‚Äôt care.**

**The whole point of him being here was to protect the property.**

**He needed to stay outside.**

**I made myself dinner, wasted some time on the internet, and went to bed.**

# I should have paid attention to his behavior.

**But I didn‚Äôt.**

---


# 7:00 AM.

**I woke up feeling well-rested.**

**I got dressed.**

**And that‚Äôs when I felt it.**

**The necklace I had found by the stream was still in my shirt pocket.**

**Weird.**

**I had completely forgotten about it.**

**I went looking for the first necklace.**

**But it was nowhere to be found.**

**I ended up washing the one I had and, without thinking much about it, put it back in my pocket.**

**I wanted to go online and research more about it.**

**But something unsettled me.**

**I needed to check on Brutus.**

**I opened the front door.**

**And my breakfast nearly came back up.**

---


# The entrance of the house was drenched in blood.

**Right in front of the mansion‚Äî**

**A dog‚Äôs severed paw.**

**Probably Brutus‚Äôs.**

**Blood trails stretched across the ground.**

**My head spun.**

**I followed the trails.**

**And then‚Äî**

**I found pieces of Brutus scattered everywhere.**

# His head was behind the small chapel, on the highest part of the property.

**Behind the chapel, I noticed holes in the ground.**

**Had Brutus been digging?**

**Or had something else started digging?**

**I took a step closer.**

**And then I saw them.**

**Small. Old. Gravestones.**

# This wasn‚Äôt a normal cemetery.

**It was a secluded part of the property.**

**A place reserved for the dead.**

# But that can wait.

**Let the dead stay where they are.**

**The real problem is my goddamn dog.**

**It must have been a jaguar.**

**I should have listened to Ti√£o.**

**I should have been more careful with the wildlife.**

**Running around the property, under the scorching sun, searching for Brutus‚Äôs remains, left me dizzy.**

**I sat down for a moment.**

**Maybe it was the stress.**

**Maybe it was the fear.**

**Fear of a jaguar?**

**They‚Äôre nocturnal.**

**There‚Äôs no way one would attack me now.**

**Then what the fuck am I afraid of?**

**Ghosts? They don‚Äôt exist.**

**Corpses? They‚Äôre already dead.**

**What harm can they do? What, give me an infection?**

**My vision darkens.**

# I black out.

---


# I wake up in the middle of the afternoon.

**I‚Äôm dirty.**

**Lying on top of one of the graves.**

**My nails are caked with dirt.**

**And bleeding.**

**Looks like I was digging.**

**Desperately.**

**Futilely.**

**Probably the shock of seeing Brutus like that triggered something in my psyche.**

# I get up.

**I go back to the mansion.**

**I take a shower.**

**I get dressed.**

**I pack a bag.**

**I need to find someone to kill that jaguar.**

**Until that happens, I can‚Äôt sleep here.**

**I need to find a hotel.**

**I‚Äôll come back tomorrow morning with someone to‚Äî**

**I don‚Äôt know.**

**Set traps?**

**Fence the property?**

**Do something.**

**Fucking nature.**

**I wasn‚Äôt expecting a jaguar.**

# I drive back to town, speeding.

**My head keeps spinning.**

**I‚Äôm seething over Brutus‚Äôs death.**

**But‚Ä¶**

**Was that really the only thing bothering me?**

# It‚Äôs late afternoon.

**I can‚Äôt find a hotel.**

**Just a small inn, a little far from the town center.**

**Looks like a simple place.**

**Which makes sense.**

**Who the hell would come visit this nowhere town?**

**An old Black woman runs the place.**

**I explain that I had a domestic accident and need to stay somewhere else for the night until I sort things out.**

**I‚Äôd rather not go into details. Trying to explain everything to this woman‚Ä¶**

**But she just looks at me.**

**Her voice is calm. Steady.**

**‚Äî Son, go rest. Get some sleep. You seem agitated.**

**‚Äî Here, you are protected.**

---

**Protected from what, exactly?**

**I think about asking.**

**But I drop it.**

**The adrenaline was fading.**

**I needed to sleep.**

# And sleep, I did.

---


# I wake up in my room at the inn.

I glance at the clock.

**It‚Äôs 11:30 PM.**

**Silence.**

Then, I hear **voices.**

Coming from **the back of the property.**

**The smell of burning wood.**

A **bonfire?**

The voices **aren‚Äôt clear.**

**Something feels off.**

I get up and move **through the darkness**, still inside the inn.

I stop near **a window facing the back.**

I slowly pull the curtain aside.

**And I start to watch.**

# At the far end of the property, hidden among the shadows, a few people were gathered.

A‚Ä¶ **terreiro \*?**¬†

***Note***\*: A ""terreiro"" is a sacred space where such rituals take place, often linked to religions like Candombl√© or Umbanda. In Brazilian folklore, these places are sometimes seen as connected to spirits, both good and bad‚Äîespecially in horror stories.\*

Honestly, **I don‚Äôt even know what to call this shit.**

All I know is that **people who are out of touch with reality think they can talk to the dead in places like this.**

**All I need right now is a hunter.**

Someone to go there and **take down a wild animal.**

Preferably **without involving the authorities.**

**And instead, the universe sticks me in a rundown inn with some kind of spirit-calling bullshit in the backyard?**

**Fuck this.**

I decide to grab my things and leave.

I‚Äôll come back **in the morning to pay for the night.**

I quietly close the curtain.

I turn around **slowly.**

And a **shiver** runs from the base of my spine to my neck.

---


# She‚Äôs there.

The old woman.

**Watching me.**

‚Äî **Son, you‚Äôre not well.**

Her tone is **calm.**

**Almost maternal.**

‚Äî **You‚Äôre the young man who bought Dona Firmina‚Äôs house, aren‚Äôt you?**

Her eyes **seem to see past me.**

‚Äî **Don‚Äôt you want to tell me what‚Äôs going on?**

I **swallow dry.**

‚Äî **Look, ma‚Äôam, I don‚Äôt mean to be rude, but honestly, no.**

Or rather‚Ä¶

To be **totally honest**, I really just need **a hunter.**

‚Äî **There‚Äôs a jaguar on my property.**

‚Äî **It killed my dog.**

‚Äî **And if I want to have my peace back, I need to get rid of that thing.**

I force an awkward chuckle.

‚Äî **So, if you don‚Äôt mind‚Ä¶ Unless you happen to know a hunter that works 24 hours.**

She **stares at me** for a moment that lasts **too long.**

Then, she **speaks, calmly.**

‚Äî **Of course, son. If that‚Äôs what you want, go ahead.**

She pauses.

Then, with **absolute certainty** in her voice, she adds:

‚Äî **But I‚Äôd bet anything that the one who killed your dog‚Ä¶**

She tilts her head slightly.

‚Äî **Was you.**

---


# My body turns cold.

That statement, **completely disconnected from reality,** sends a wave of terror through me.

‚Äî **Look‚Ä¶ We don‚Äôt know each other, but I‚Äôve never even killed a damn ant.**

My voice comes out **sharper than I intended.**

‚Äî **Let alone a dog I paid good money for.**

I pause.

Then I add:

‚Äî **You‚Äôre probably saying this to extort me.**

‚Äî **To blackmail me with some kind of animal cruelty accusation or something‚Ä¶**

She lets out a slow sigh.

Then, in **a hushed voice**:

‚Äî **Son‚Ä¶**

Her tone is more **sad than accusatory.**

‚Äî **You don‚Äôt see it.**

**But I do.**

‚Äî **He‚Äôs right behind you.**

‚Äî **Laughing.**

‚Äî **Waiting for just one more night.**

She **pauses.**

Then, she **smiles softly.**

‚Äî **When you decide to believe me‚Ä¶ call me.**

Her voice is **steady, confident.**

‚Äî **I‚Äôll be here waiting.**

# My heart starts racing.

‚Äî **Alright, alright, alright.**

I reach into my pocket and pull out a bill.

I throw it onto the floor.

‚Äî **Here. That covers my stay.**

My voice comes out **more unsteady than I‚Äôd like.**

‚Äî **Now, if you don‚Äôt mind‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd like to leave.**

I **walk out fast.**

# I‚Äôm not going back to the mansion.

I don‚Äôt want to deal with **a jaguar.**

But I‚Äôm **sure as hell not sleeping in this place.**

**No fucking way.**

---


# Maybe I should drive to a bigger town.

**Find a real hotel.**

**But no.**

**I feel too exhausted.**

**I drive to a gas station.**

**Lock the car.**

**Recline the driver‚Äôs seat.**

**And sleep.**

---


# 10:00 AM.

**I wake up with the sun burning my face.**

**Unshaven.**

**Mouth dry, breath awful.**

**I reach for a mint in the car‚Äôs console.**

**Nothing.**

**I must look like absolute shit.**

# I drive back to the mansion.

**I pass by Brutus‚Äôs remains.**

**The stench is unbearable now.**

**Dried blood everywhere.**

**I step inside and lock the door.**

**I need to pull myself together.**

**But I can‚Äôt think straight.**

**I‚Äôm not even hungry.**

# I collapse onto the couch.

**And sleep again.**

---


# I wake up in the stream.

**No boots.**

**Feet wet.**

# The sun looks low.

**It must be around 5:00 PM.**

**Something is happening to me.**

**This must be stress-induced.**

**Some kind of physiological response.**

**A form of sleepwalking.**

# I grab my phone.

**I need to call someone.**

**I need medical attention.**

# No signal.

**Goddamn forest.**

**I climb up to the chapel, on the highest part of the property.**

**The signal should work there.**

**I walk barefoot, my feet scraping against the rocks.**

**I reach the top.**

**Still no signal.**

# But there is something inside the chapel.

**I move closer, carefully.**

**I peek inside.**

---


# Candles.

**Lit.**

# In the center of the chapel, a clay bowl.

**Inside it, rotting entrails.**

**Brutus‚Äôs, maybe?**

**I walk toward the back of the chapel.**

**The broken tombstones are still there.**

**But they‚Äôve been rearranged.**

**The stones now spell out names.**

**Dona Isolda Salgado, 1822 - 1854**

**Julieta Salgado, 1844 - 1854**

**Astolfo Salgado, 1843 - 1854**

**Sebasti√£o Salgado, 1801 - 1854**

# I lose my breath.

**They all died the same year.**

**I find myself whispering out loud:**

**‚Äî Who the hell arranged this?**

# A shiver runs down my spine.

---

**A voice behind me.**

**Soft.**

**But cutting.**

**‚Äî You, son.**

**‚Äî It‚Äôs all you.**

# I spin around instinctively.

**The old woman from the inn.**

**She‚Äôs not alone.**

**Beside her, another woman.**

**Just as old.**

**Maybe older.**

**And a young man.**

**Black. Strong. Built.**

# Adrenaline surges through my body.

**I shout:**

**‚Äî What the fuck are you doing here?!**

**She remains calm.**

**‚Äî Calm down. Listen to me for five minutes.**

**‚Äî If after that you want us gone, we‚Äôll leave.**

**‚Äî And we‚Äôll never come back.**

# I grit my teeth.

**My hands tremble.**

**My breathing is heavy.**

**‚Äî Fine.**

**I take a deep breath.**

**‚Äî Five minutes.**

**I say, impatient.**

---


**She proceeds, serious:**

**‚Äî Before I tell you anything, you need to say these exact words: ""I revoke my permission.""**

**I recoil.**

**‚Äî Permission for what?**

**My voice comes out sharper than I intended.**

**She hardens her gaze.**

**‚Äî SAY IT NOW!**

**She shouts.**

**‚Äî Fine, fine!**

**‚Äî I revoke my permission. Happy?**

**I say it impatiently.**

# Relief is immediate on their faces.

**But before I can even begin to process what just happened‚Äî**

**The old woman turns to the young man and orders:**

**‚Äî Jo√£o, now. Make him throw it up.**

# What?!

**Before I can react, Jo√£o grabs me.**

**His grip is unbelievably strong.**

**He presses my stomach with a force that shouldn‚Äôt be possible.**

**My ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù engineer physique doesn‚Äôt stand a chance.**

**I vomit.**

# And chunks of raw, rotting entrails spill from my mouth.

**(Brutus?)**

**My body shakes.**

**The stench is unbearable.**

**My mind refuses to accept what my eyes are seeing.**

# The old woman looks at me again.

**Her voice is cold. Precise. Irrefutable.**

**‚Äî This woman next to me is Dona Firmina.**

**‚Äî She‚Äôs the great-niece of Dona Isolda.**

**‚Äî The grave you were lying on? That was hers.**

**‚Äî And I‚Ä¶**

**She pauses.**

**As if debating whether she should go on.**

**Then, she does.**

**‚Äî I am the great-granddaughter of the slave that family owned.**

**I feel my heartbeat accelerate.**

**She doesn‚Äôt blink.**

**She continues:**

**‚Äî Dr. Salgado was obsessed with Dona Isolda.**

**‚Äî He was a jealous man. Possessive.**

**‚Äî But more than that‚Ä¶ he was fascinated by the rituals of my ancestors.**

**‚Äî In his madness, he sought a way to live forever‚Äî**

**‚Äî By Isolda‚Äôs side.**

# The chapel feels smaller.

**The air thicker.**

**The old woman doesn‚Äôt stop.**

**‚Äî After years of searching, he found a slave who promised him a ritual.**

**‚Äî A ritual for eternal life.**

**She shakes her head.**

**‚Äî I don‚Äôt know what that man was planning. Don‚Äôt ask me.**

**‚Äî But that ritual‚Ä¶**

**She pauses.**

**‚Äî Dr. Salgado murdered his entire family.**

**‚Äî Then he killed himself.**

**‚Äî Right here. In this very chapel.**

# Silence hangs in the air.

**But the old woman still isn‚Äôt finished.**

**‚Äî The promise that man made to him?**

**‚Äî It worked.**

**‚Äî Salgado achieved eternal life.**

**‚Äî But not as a man.**

**‚Äî He became something worse.**

**‚Äî He still exists.**

**‚Äî But he survives as a demon, by taking the bodies of the living.**

# My breath quickens.

---

**But she doesn‚Äôt stop.**

**‚Äî My great-grandmother wouldn‚Äôt let that happen to Isolda.**

**‚Äî She banished Dr. Salgado‚Äôs soul from this land.**

**‚Äî And without access to his remains‚Ä¶**

**‚Äî The ritual became useless.**

# The old woman takes a deep breath.

Then, she **drops the final piece of the puzzle**:

‚Äî **In some way, you‚Äôve already met Dr. Salgado.**

‚Äî **Maybe by another name.**

‚Äî **Sebasti√£o Salgado.**

# My blood turns to ice.

---

**Ti√£o. Short for Sebasti√£o.**

---

The old woman **continues, unwavering**:

‚Äî **He and his family haunt this region, beyond the limits of this land.**

‚Äî **He as the tormentor.**

‚Äî **His wife and children as his victims.**

‚Äî **And you‚Ä¶**

‚Äî **You let him in.**

‚Äî **You gave him access to his remains.**

‚Äî **And he nearly took over your body.**

‚Äî **He almost cast your soul into the abyss.**

# The weight of her words crushes me.

And then, she tilts her head.

She **studies me.**

Like she‚Äôs trying to **figure something out.**

Something **even she doesn‚Äôt understand.**

‚Äî **But what intrigues me the most‚Ä¶**

She squints slightly.

‚Äî **‚Ä¶ is how you‚Äôre still here.**

‚Äî **Something has been protecting you.**

‚Äî **And neither you nor I know what it is.**

‚Äî **If you ever find out‚Ä¶ be grateful.**

‚Äî **Because by now‚Ä¶**

She takes a slow breath.

‚Äî **You should have already been lost.**

---

# My head pounds.

---

I **force my mind** to process everything.

But it‚Äôs **impossible.**

So I say **the only thing I can manage**:

‚Äî **Wait.**

My voice **trembles slightly.**

‚Äî **I admit‚Ä¶ this is all absurdly confusing.**

I pause.

‚Äî **But I met Ti√£o.**

‚Äî **He‚Äôs my neighbor.**

‚Äî **I saw his family.**

‚Äî **I shook his hand.**

‚Äî **How can they be the ""ghosts"" you claim‚Ä¶ if they‚Äôre alive just a few kilometers away?**

‚Äî **It doesn‚Äôt make sense!**

The old woman **smiles.**

But it‚Äôs **not just any smile.**

It‚Äôs a **smile full of compassion. And pity.**

‚Äî **Then why don‚Äôt you go visit them?**

She turns to Jo√£o and Dona Firmina.

‚Äî **Take him there.**

‚Äî **I‚Äôll stay behind to undo the ritual.**

---


# I don‚Äôt hesitate.

I get into my truck.

Jo√£o and Dona Firmina follow in **an old, battered car.**

**I‚Äôm going to prove them wrong.**

# We drive fast to Ti√£o‚Äôs house.

The **wattle and daub shack** he called home.

We step out.

I **walk straight to the house.**

**Door closed.**

**Windows shut.**

They follow close behind.

I knock.

**Once.**

**Twice.**

**Three times.**

# Nothing.

The door is **unlocked.**

I push it open.

I turn on my **phone‚Äôs flashlight** and shine it inside.

# Cobwebs.

**Dust.**

**Filth.**

# This place hasn‚Äôt been lived in for years.

Then, in the middle of what should have been the living room, **something makes my breath hitch.**

A **basket of fruit.**

**Rotten.**

---

# My basket of fruit.

---

I step outside. **Pale.**

My **whole body trembles.**

Jo√£o and Dona Firmina **look at me with sympathy.**

**They know.**

# Now, I understand.

There is **no denying it anymore.**

Maybe I will **never be the same again.**

# Then, my eyes drift to my truck.

And **my heart stops.**

# Ti√£o is there.

Leaning against it.

**Staring at me.**

# The same smile.

**The smile that never changed.**

Like he **knows.**

Like he **knows exactly what just happened.**

Like he **knows‚Ä¶**

# That this was just the beginning.

**My breath catches.**

I scream.

‚Äî **HE! RIGHT THERE! YOU SEE HIM?!**

Dona Firmina **doesn‚Äôt even look.**

She just sighs.

And **calmly** says:

‚Äî **Son‚Ä¶**

She looks straight into my eyes.

‚Äî **There‚Äôs no one there.**

# Prologue

I was the last to leave, carrying only my personal items.

Tied to the roof beam, where it was.

I saw him.

I‚Äôve known about this guy best friend since day one and I‚Äôve got pretty close with him too and even call him my friend now too. Last summer my gf wanted clarification on what was disrespectful to do in terms of hanging out with him. I told her lunch/coffee and things of that nature are fine with me but going out for drinks alone is absolutely off the table. 
Well last night we had dinner at home, wine, and legos planned. I was running about 15-20 minutes late because I had to unexpectedly pick up my brother from school and get him food on the way back. She texts me asking me ‚ÄúWya?‚Äù I reply to her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in the bathroom. Just going to change and head over‚Äù. She replies, ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay you don‚Äôt have to come over anymore.‚Äù 
30 minutes later she texts her guy best friend, ‚Äúhey im lowkey feeling sad. Are you down to go to the beach and drink?‚Äù 
This whole time I had no idea who she was with because she didn‚Äôt text me anything. She had left her Apple Watch at my house and it kept vibrating so I checked it and saw her messages with him. I became furious and instantly texted her telling her ‚ÄúLmk when/if you wanna pick up your stuff from my house.‚Äù 

Anyways we went back and forth like crazy last night and she is in my bed right now sleeping next to me. I don‚Äôt know if I can still be with her because she has yet to apologize or acknowledge what she did was wrong. I feel so betrayed because this isn‚Äôt the only time she has made me question her loyalty. She has done a lot of questionable things in the past.

An unexpected plan change (currently in Tokyo) for next week:  Nagano/mountains are out. Instead I want to  spend three nights in Kyoto next week, slipping in before the Sakura mania, and am quickly looking for accommodation.  

** solo F, middle aged.  
** budget up to $150 USD per night.  
** not into night life but enjoy safe after dark strolls. 
** food and coffee from small places ‚Äî not ‚Äú fine dining‚Äù. 
** plan to explore the usual places by day.

And general puttering, enjoying simply being present.

Gion? Or near the market?  Less touristic areas. Probably not by the train station‚Ä¶

I would appreciate suggestions of neighborhoods and specific hotels etc.  I do not use AirBnB but rely heavily on booking and agoda.

1ivyrc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sororities/comments/1ivyrc5/struggling_with_my_cob_experience_and_sorority_fit/,Struggling with my COB experience and sorority fit,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm a transfer student at a large state school and have been struggling with my social life here. I‚Äôve always been used to facing exclusion in social settings as a WOC, and I initially thought Greek life wouldn‚Äôt be the solution. However, after spending my fall semester bending over backwards trying to build a social life through clubs and common interests, it felt like I was getting nothing in return.

I tried dorming to be closer to a social group, but I ended up in the most antisocial dorm with a violent roommate, which led to months of stress. I‚Äôm a people person, and in theory, a social butterfly, but it was tough to be stuck in a situation with people who don‚Äôt engage socially at all.

I noticed that Panhel is diverse here, with a lot of really cool and friendly girls, so I thought I‚Äôd give COB a shot. Last year, quite a few houses were doing COB, but this year, it was pretty slim. The house I ended up in offered me a bid after just one coffee chat, and I didn‚Äôt even show up to their COB events, so I‚Äôm feeling a little confused and unsure.

At first, I was excited about the house because I liked the chapter‚Äôs philosophy and the alumnae network, but now, I‚Äôm starting to feel a little less enthusiastic. I counted 94 people on last year‚Äôs composite. There were 25 girls in the fall pledge class and a whopping 19 in mine. Does this mean the chapter has low retention? I also noticed a second-semester senior in my pledge class, which I thought was odd, pledging 2.5 months before graduation. On top of that, I learned that a bunch of the VPs were initiated just last semester, which raises even more questions about the chapter‚Äôs stability. Does this mean they‚Äôre giving bids to literally anyone, even if it creates a mismatched mix of personalities? Are we that desperately struggling with retention?

We have the smallest house on the row (reinstated a little over 10 years ago), and I don‚Äôt understand why they‚Äôd need to bid just anyone who rushes. Right now, there are about 115 actives, including my pledge class, whereas the house can fit 30-40 live-ins (at this school you usually live in for 2 years), so it seems unnecessary to give bids so broadly.

A lot of the girls in my pledge class seem standoffish. I‚Äôve tried talking to a few, but they seem awkward, even though I‚Äôm pretty outgoing and love to engage. I‚Äôve realized that this house feels more like it‚Äôs filled with nerdy, mellow/shy girls‚Äînothing wrong with that, but it‚Äôs not really the vibe I was expecting, and I‚Äôm struggling to connect.

I talked to my parents, who encouraged me to stick it out for the alumnae connections, housing (which is extremely cheap compared to renting in this city), academic motivation, and personal development/fulfillment. Even if I don‚Äôt live in the house, they think staying in the sorority is not a bad idea, and they‚Äôll help with dues.

Unfortunately, housing is full for next year, but the housing director said I could likely take someone‚Äôs spot in the spring, which would already be my second-semester senior year (still saves thousands of dollars). Also since the house is so small we don‚Äôt have a chef, but other houses with similar dues do.

I highly regret not doing fall formal recruitment. As a transfer, I had one realistic shot at primary recruitment. I‚Äôm an extrovert and think I could‚Äôve gotten into a very decent house.

Now that I‚Äôm in this house, I don‚Äôt have any ‚Äúfriend crushes‚Äù on anyone yet. Everyone‚Äôs nice, but I haven‚Äôt had that ‚Äúwow, I want to be friends with her‚Äù moment. There‚Äôs another similar-tier bottom house on the row that has a good sisterhood and even a celebrity in their chapter, so I‚Äôm not even sure if it‚Äôs the rank that‚Äôs holding me back. I think this chapter might just be being run poorly.

Has anyone else been in a similar position? How do I make the most of this situation, and do you think things could improve over time? Should I stick it out and give it more time to see if it clicks, or should I cut my losses and move on?",4,1740274617.0,Sororities,1,1.0,False

It started when I caught a glimpse of myself in a window reflection during my morning commute. What I saw wasn‚Äôt just my reflection‚Äîit was the weight of years spent ignoring my health, letting my energy levels plummet, and resigning myself to the idea that losing weight was impossible without sacrificing my lifestyle. I felt trapped in my own body, frustrated and hopeless. That‚Äôs when everything changed.

I came across a solution that promised to transform how my body worked at its core. It wasn‚Äôt a magic pill, a brutal workout routine, or some obscure diet I had to force myself to stick to. It was simple, practical, and backed by science. It was the moment I decided to stop being a bystander in my own life.

At first, I was skeptical. I‚Äôd heard it all before‚Äî‚ÄúLose weight fast!‚Äù ‚ÄúGet fit without effort!‚Äù But this approach spoke to something deeper. It wasn‚Äôt just about shedding pounds; it was about rewiring how my body processed food and burned fat. Within days, I noticed a difference. My energy levels shot up, and I wasn‚Äôt constantly craving the sugary snacks that used to rule my afternoons. It felt like my body was finally working with me instead of against me.

The real transformation, though, wasn‚Äôt just in my body. Sure, the numbers on the scale dropped faster than I‚Äôd dared to hope. I lost 15 pounds in the first two weeks, and by the end of the month, I had shed 28 pounds of stubborn fat from my belly, thighs, and arms. But the bigger victory was how I felt‚Äîunstoppable, confident, and full of life.

For years, I‚Äôd struggled with energy dips that made afternoons unbearable. I was tired of being tired. This new approach gave me sustained energy that kept me going from sunrise to sunset. My productivity skyrocketed. I wasn‚Äôt just more active; I was more present. Family gatherings, work deadlines, even casual coffee dates‚ÄîI showed up as the best version of myself every single time.

What made this journey even more incredible was how effortless it felt. I didn‚Äôt have to give up my favorite foods or commit to a workout routine that felt like punishment. Instead, my body naturally adjusted to a healthier rhythm. Meals became more enjoyable, cravings less frequent, and workouts felt empowering rather than draining.

This wasn‚Äôt just a short-term fix. It was a sustainable transformation. As I write this, I‚Äôve maintained my weight loss for months without feeling like I‚Äôm ‚Äúon a diet.‚Äù My clothes fit better, my confidence is through the roof, and for the first time in years, I feel like I‚Äôm living, not just existing.

It‚Äôs funny to think how one small decision changed everything. Looking back, it wasn‚Äôt just about the weight loss‚Äîit was about rediscovering who I am and reclaiming my life. If you‚Äôve ever felt stuck, tired, or overwhelmed by all the noise out there about what works and what doesn‚Äôt, let me tell you this: the right solution is out there. You just have to take that first step.

Today, I don‚Äôt just feel lighter physically‚ÄîI feel lighter emotionally and mentally. My body, mind, and spirit are aligned in a way I never thought possible. And it all started with a single choice to believe in something new, something different, and most importantly, something that worked.

If you‚Äôre ready to make a change, there‚Äôs no better time than now. I‚Äôm living proof that transformation isn‚Äôt just a dream‚Äîit‚Äôs a decision away. The results speak for themselves. My only regret? Not starting sooner.

What sets this journey apart from every other ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù solution I‚Äôve tried is the science behind the transformation. When I started, I wasn‚Äôt just curious about how well it would work‚ÄîI wanted to understand *why* it worked. That‚Äôs where ElectroSlim‚Äôs unique approach blew me away.

The foundation of its effectiveness lies in its ability to boost GLP-1, a naturally occurring hormone that governs blood sugar regulation, appetite control, and fat metabolism. Think of GLP-1 as your body‚Äôs internal traffic controller for energy. When it‚Äôs operating at optimal levels, your cravings decrease, your metabolism revs up, and your body burns fat like a finely tuned machine.

ElectroSlim includes CapsiMax¬Æ, a powerful capsicum extract derived from red chili peppers. Studies show that CapsiMax has a thermogenic effect‚Äîmeaning it helps your body produce heat and burn calories more effectively. This isn‚Äôt just marketing fluff; it‚Äôs backed by peer-reviewed science. CapsiMax works to increase GLP-1 levels, creating a natural metabolic boost that doesn‚Äôt leave you jittery or crashing like some other supplements do.

Another key player in the formula is Metabolyte‚Ñ¢, a proprietary compound designed to support enzymes that break down stored fat and inhibit the absorption of excess calories. Instead of relying on deprivation or extreme measures, this ingredient helps your body do what it was always meant to do: process food efficiently and burn fat for energy.

Then there‚Äôs Sukre‚Ñ¢, a natural appetite suppressant that helped me overcome my biggest nemesis‚Äîlate-night cravings. For years, I was trapped in a cycle of eating after dinner, sabotaging my progress with sugary snacks that left me feeling sluggish the next day. Sukre broke that cycle by promoting a feeling of fullness and satisfaction that lasted longer than I ever thought possible.

ElectroSlim also includes L-Taurine, an amino acid known for its role in energy production and metabolism. It‚Äôs like fuel for your cells, helping your body tap into stored fat reserves while maintaining high energy levels throughout the day. Unlike other products that leave you feeling drained, L-Taurine ensures you have the stamina to tackle whatever life throws at you.

Magnesium Citrate and Chromium Picolinate round out the formula, addressing two crucial factors in weight loss and overall health: blood sugar regulation and digestion. Magnesium supports healthy digestion and detoxification, while Chromium helps stabilize blood sugar levels, reducing those intense cravings for carbs and sweets.

What struck me the most about this combination of ingredients is how they work synergistically. It‚Äôs not just one element doing all the heavy lifting‚Äîit‚Äôs a carefully calibrated blend that targets weight loss and metabolic health from multiple angles. This holistic approach is what makes ElectroSlim stand out in a crowded market of ‚Äúquick fixes.‚Äù

I dug deeper into the research behind each ingredient, and the findings were clear: these aren‚Äôt just trendy buzzwords slapped onto a label. They‚Äôre proven, science-backed components with decades of studies to support their effectiveness. More importantly, they‚Äôre combined in a way that amplifies their individual benefits, creating a product that‚Äôs greater than the sum of its parts.

ElectroSlim doesn‚Äôt just treat the symptoms of weight gain‚Äîit addresses the root causes. It‚Äôs like giving your body the reset button it desperately needs. By boosting GLP-1, improving energy metabolism, and balancing blood sugar, it helps your body transition into a state where fat loss becomes effortless and sustainable.

Science made the difference for me. Understanding how these ingredients worked gave me confidence in the process, and seeing the results solidified my belief that ElectroSlim is a game-changer. It‚Äôs not magic‚Äîit‚Äôs biology, optimized. And when you give your body the right tools, the transformation is nothing short of extraordinary.

This isn‚Äôt just about losing weight‚Äîit‚Äôs about regaining control, boosting your health, and unlocking a better version of yourself. The science of ElectroSlim doesn‚Äôt just make that possible; it makes it inevitable. And I‚Äôm living proof.

Groceries for the household $400. Coffee, going out, and other bullshit $200. Emergency fund contributions $200. My total monthly budget comes to: approx $3,200 a month. 

Next month I‚Äôll be paying $275 into Canadian student loans (9.5 year repayment). September I‚Äôll be paying off AB loans, and if I take the longest payment option (9.5 years) that‚Äôs $625 a month (with $19,400 in interest!!!) 

If I take home $3800 a month, my budget is $3200, but my repayment is an extra $900 a month‚Ä¶ My monthly net is -$300.

Right now I‚Äôm picking up shifts to payoff my LOC before September and to build my emergency fund. I‚Äôm going to start donating plasma as well to earn a bit of extra cash. I can‚Äôt work anymore than I am currently because 12-hr shifts as an RN and working a second job is seriously impacting my mental health. I can‚Äôt move up north to make more as an RN because of family obligations. I feel *stuck*. 

Does anyone have any advice? (27 yo M.)

First thoughts: Pine green. I played it safe before I remembered how many green tops in various silhouettes I own, but the color itself is great, it‚Äôs a very cozy green. 
 I went with black buttons per Mauro‚Äôs advice and the colors look perfect together. The yarn itself is super bouncy and springy, I love how it drapes and the oversized fit I wanted works well with the silhouette. I did size up but I think TTS would have fit a little better so I‚Äôll adjust accordingly if these return.  I also noticed that the cardigan is cool to the touch despite it being a warmish day here. 

Overall I‚Äôm super happy with the cardigan and I hope these come back some day. I did not realize how much I would love it, totally should‚Äôve picked up pink and purple as wellüò≠

You don't let your politics or religion dictate your journalism. You stay true to the truth. You stay true to your word. When I heard you were being sued by Logan Paul I bought four of your shirts. You didn't have to give the discounts you did. I'd have bought them at full price just to help you stick it to that piece of shit. (Edit: Admittedly, my bank account appreciates the discount tho).

You are a beacon of light in a world of darkness right now. You openly admit how you've been told to not antagonize the president. And I fully understand how such an investigation into an obvious scam could put you and your family in harms way.

I don't think I'll survive.,"The unspoken truth of every new job is that the spot you find yourself in once belonged to someone who fled or was taken out. Each office chair, an ergonomic headstone in a professional graveyard.¬†

But you never start a gig thinking of how it will end.

As I sat at my desk waiting to find out if I had reached my end at *Coastline Magazine*, all I thought about was my beginning.

In the six months since my graduation from journalism school, I received rigorous instruction on why I shouldn't have gone to journalism school. Fifty applications resulted in three interviews that resulted in zero job offers.¬†

Then *Coastline* called.¬†

*Coastline* was the magazine that got me interested in writing in the first place. When I was a kid, my dad would read me articles like they were bedtimes stories. I could rattle the names the staff writers off like they were superheroes. Peter Strum was my favorite. He'd spend months buried in research, unearthing incredible stories from the past, before laying out everything he learned in an article that read like a thriller. I can still remember the rush I'd get when my dad would return from the mailbox with a new issue, the smile on his face when he saw my reaction. Thinking back to those times is when I remember him the most clearly.¬†

The interview at *Coastline* went as the others had, so I wasn't hopeful. I sat in the uncomfortable chair across the HR lady as she scanned my resume, feeling like a kid who put on her mom's blazer to play work. She recited my greatest accomplishments back to me in a way that made me embarrassed by each and every one.¬†

""Editor of your college newspaper,"" she said. ""Very impressive."" My inadequacy was an old friend at that point.

I knew what came next. But instead of pivoting to a lament on the state of the industry, the HR lady asked about money. I was beside myself. Companies usually expect you to treat a salary like an incidental side effect of doing what you love‚Äîworking for them. She, however, wanted to know how much I was expecting to make, like asking a starving person if they wanted fries with that.¬†

""I haven't given it much thought,"" I said. ""I guess I would say it's negotiable.""

""Well, let's negotiate.""

I sat for a long time, waiting for her to start. Then I said ""Forty"" with the hope that vomiting any number would bring me closer to leaving.

Her frown told me that I had aimed too high, so I decided that debasing myself was the only solution. ""But honestly, thirty would be more than generous.""

Her lacquered lips collapsed inward, disappearing as if to steel themselves before telling me to ""Get fucked.""

""Twenty seems fair,"" I said.

¬†

Her smile returned. We shook hands shortly after.

When I think back to my time at *Coastline Magazine*‚Äîall the late nights, demeaning tasks, the blood spilt, and lives lost‚Äînegotiating myself below the poverty line strikes me as an almost-charming detail.

\*\*\*

I should probably give you some context about *Coastline*.¬†

You see, a magazine was like a collection of articles that someone printed and mailed to you every month‚Äîsometimes even weekly.

It seems silly now, but there was a time when the words on those glossy pages mattered. That's what my dad thought, at least. He grew up dreaming of the world in a town that could only offer the drugstore magazine rack. Then he met mom, had me, and found whatever he was looking for, I guess. But in me, he saw opportunity and‚Äîunfortunately for both of us‚Äîhope. He knew that people could live adventurous lives, and the bylines in *Coastline* were proof of that.¬†

Then the world changed. Dad died, and the internet devoured most magazines. Losing him was made harder by the thought of saying goodbye to a thing we loved. That reckoning never came for *Coastline*, though. Through recessions and algorithm tweaks and pivots to video, its blend of center-left politics, celebrity profiles, and investigative longreads somehow endured as a last bastion of print media‚Äîunnaturally, some would joke.¬†

I, on the other hand, found ""unnaturally"" to be the case precisely.

My first day was the Monday following the interview. I had requested an additional week of time off before starting. When they asked why, the honest answer‚Äî""enjoying one last taste of freedom""‚Äîdidn't seem prudent, so I said Monday would be great.¬†

The HR lady met me at the elevator at 10 and ushered me my desk. The newsroom for *Coastline Magazine* occupied the top floor of a converted textile mill. Old ductwork still hung from the ceiling, and if you looked closely, you could see scorch marks on the exposed brick wall from the fire that killed a couple dozen immigrants around the turn of the century.¬†

My desk sat at the very center of the open floor plan, one of a collection of six meekly divided workstations crammed onto two long tables. ""This is where our editorial assistants work,"" the HR lady said. ""Known affectionately around these parts as 'The Pit.' And these fine folks are the Pit Crew."" She signaled to the five hunched backs that surrounded us, each with the faint bluish glow of the computer screen just beyond it. Four turned to introduce themselves in a flurry of names I immediately forgot.¬†

But Kelsey's name I would remember. Settled deep into the seat next to mine, she didn't acknowledge me when I first arrived at my desk or after the HR lady left, instructing the rest of the Pit Crew to answer any questions I might have. As soon as she was gone, everyone returned to their work, and I was on my own.

Though the dull gray desktop smelled like it was freshly spritzed with green industrial cleaner, when I sat down I found that the drawers underneath it were still filled with the belongings from the previous tenant. There were breath mints, tampons, and a hoarded stack of Post-It pads. The personalized mug bearing the name Claire in friendly script held pens, their caps all nervously chewed.

The corner of a folded scrap of paper stuck out from beneath the mug's chunky base. I could lie to you and say that I thought the note might help identify the owner of the belongings, but I'm just nosy. And considering what I found on the paper, it served me right.

The creases across the yellowed page were deep, like it had been refolded again and again over years. There were only three lines of scribbled writing scrawled across its center.¬†

*I*

*Complete each task, for then sleep is earned.*

*II*

*Obey the foremen, for foremen shall you be.*

*III*

*Beware the Minder, for it knows not of mercy.*

As I stared at the lines, I knew I wanted nothing to do with whatever they meant. I turned to Kelsey. Her hard eyes were fixed on her screen. I couldn't decide whether they looked red because she had been crying or she was going for something with her makeup.

""Hi,"" I said tamping down the creeping dread with a smile. ""I didn't catch your name.""

""Kelsey."" There was no life in her voice.¬†

""Nice to meet you. I was just going through my desk. I think there's some stuff left from the girl who was here bef‚Äî"" Kelsey was out of her seat and gone before I could finish.¬†

With no one else to turn to, I emailed the HR lady about the unemptied drawer, doing my best to keep the email short and positive. I only apologized four times.¬†

It was Pit Crew tradition to get lunch together whenever someone new started. But Kelsey wasn't back by the time everyone was ready to go, and when someone mentioned that we had already wasted five minutes waiting, we left without her. Over an $18 salad, I fielded impersonal questions about what I hoped to do at *Coastline*. I said I wanted to be an editor, and the others exchanged looks. I didn't understand their meaning, but couldn't confuse their temperature as anything other than shady.¬†

Everyone got quiet when I asked what happened to Claire. ""She left,"" one of them said, almost defensive, after a long pause. I had figured, I told them, but I hoped to learn why, knowing that nothing engendered the new kid quite like shit talk. Once again, the Pit Crew clammed up. One of them broke the silence by saying we better get back. We'd been gone for 15 minutes.

Claire's drawer was empty when I got back.

That night I watched as my new co-workers left, one-by-one. Every ten minutes, I had to stand up and wave in the direction of a motion detector to turn the lights back on. But soon, without fail, I'd find myself once again submerged in darkness, the ghostly glow of my laptop screen the only light. I never shook the feeling that something was watching me in those moments.

At 9:30, there was still no sign of Kelsey. Her bag lay on her desk, exactly where it had been when she ran off. I was concerned‚Äîand also my mom had told me to not let anyone see you leave on your first day.

I did a lap around the empty office. Every light still burned, but not a soul remained. In the break room, I perused the ample snack cabinet and found Claire's left-behind belongings dumped out into the garbage bin, her chewed-up pen caps mixed in with the used K-Cups. The note, however, was missing.

Kelsey's Converse were sticking out from under one of the bathroom stalls when I poked my head inside the women's room. I entered the one next to hers and crouched beside our shared wall. Small sobs were the only sound that made it through. ""Kelsey,"" I said. ""It's Sam. Are you okay?""¬†

I pressed my ear closer to the laminate divider. She sniffled. Her whispers were barely audible.

She told me I was going to die there.¬†

She said we all were.¬†

She was probably best friend I ever had.

\*\*\*

I was working at *Coastline* three whole days before someone screamed at me. There are four kinds of artificial sweeter, I learned. And apparently ingesting the wrong one is worth tearing into the new assistant‚Äîwho, mind you, is a girl with three roommates and a shower curtain for a bedroom door.¬†

Whenever we could, Kelsey and I stole moments to talk. She was close with Claire, the girl who sat at my desk before me. But everything changed two weeks earlier, when Claire had spoken to one of the editors about a promotion. She returned to the Pit visibly shaken and refused to tell her friend any of what had transpired. Claire was gone a week later. Kelsey didn't know it was for good until they hired me.

I told her about the strange, scribbled note, but neither of us knew what to make of it. We decided the early scratchings of a YA novel side-project was most likely, since we both had our own. If Claire's request had been poorly received, that could account for her hasty exit, but not her complete ghosting of Kelsey. We theorized about explanations, compiled lists of the likeliest creeps on staff, and trolled the mastheads of other publications, praying to see her name appear.

But employment, like the inexorable march of time, flattens all things. Fears, passions, plans for retirement. Months slipped by without answers, the endless rhythm of work weeks pulling us through the end of the year like a riptide. There was too much else to worry about, deadlines to meet, and tantrums to manage. That was the nice thing about *Coastline*. Some new trouble always popped up to take the air out of the old.

Kelsey was a constant through it all. She could turn a day around with the precise timing of an eye roll. She knew where the editor-in-chief stored his special little snacks and how many we could take before someone noticed. She told me who to avoid and which happy hours specials we could take solace in when avoidance wasn't an option.¬†

The day we returned from New Years break‚ÄîJanuary 2nd‚Äîthe Pit Crew were each meted out to senior writers like college-educated chattel to assist with long-term projects.

I got Peter Strum.¬†

In my six months at *Coastline*, I had yet to lay eyes on mine and Dad's favorite writer. He had apparently been off on assignment, but with the New Year was returning to the office to compile his research and start writing. I found his office door situated in the farthest corner of the floor, closed with a note stuck to it. ""Come on in,"" it read.

The space was more like a burrow than an office. The lamp on the desk illuminated only a fraction of the hundreds of books and antiquities crammed onto the shelves behind the desk. But without either Peter or further instructions, I was left with no choice but to look at all his stuff. Beneath a bejeweled dagger, a set of bagpipes, and an enormous conch sat a framed tintype photo. The four bearded men pictured stood side-by-side in a lush field. Their hollow cheeks were smeared with dirt. Their eyes were sunken and haunted. I couldn't look away.

""Now that's an interesting story,"" the voice behind me said.¬†

I jumped and said ""fuck"" too loudly. Peter stood in the doorway, an exact copy of the image I venerated in my mind for so long‚Äîpudgy, bespectacled, balding, a flat smile. Before I knew it, he was next to me, pointing at the image.¬†

Peter said that the guys were this reclusive group of Irish farmers from the late eighteen hundreds. When the Great Famine hit, they withdrew to the hills, completely cut ties with the other villages in the county. People said that these farmers had figured out a way to save their crops from the blight. No one was ever able to learn the truth. Villagers tried, but the farmers fiercely‚Äîsometimes violently‚Äîprotected their crops and their secret. And so rumor, in the absence of fact, begot myth. There were whispers of an evil up in the hills. Something that granted good luck to all of the farmers' endeavors‚Äîfor a price. Peter spent a lot of time looking into it, but the only lead he ever came across was two words: *dia nua*.¬†

It's Gaelic, he said. It means ""new god.""

A chill would have gone down my spine, but the office was already freezing.¬†

Once the blight disappeared and word of the farmers' success spread, they decided to capitalize on their infamy and publish an almanac, chronicling what they had learned‚Äîmost of it anyway. Over the years, the almanac evolved, eventually becoming *Coastline Magazine*.¬†

Peter's eye flicked to the side to gauge my reaction to his kicker, but I didn't need to perform. The guy was good. I introduced myself and my fandom, trying my best not to scare him. He didn't seem to mind.¬†

We worked together nonstop for the next few weeks, me cataloging his notes and him laying out the loose structure of his eventual article. Sometimes we chatted. Others, he monologued about the state of the industry, how we were on the verge of losing something culturally that it was *Coastline*'s duty to sustain. I'd agree, and he'd admire my insight, before we returned to our quiet, focused work.

It was in those small moments when I felt most aware that I was actually at *Coastline*, doing work I was meant to, what my dad had dreamt for me.

After one late night in Peter's office, I returned to the Pit to find Kelsey still at her desk. She was the only assistant left, and the second I saw her, I knew she had been waiting for me. She said we needed to talk. When I didn't immediately know what we had to discuss, she got mad. Tom, one of the other assistants, hadn't been heard from since before the holiday, and when Kelsey asked his manager about it, she was accused of insubordination.¬†

""It's Claire all over again,"" she insisted. There *had* to be something going on here.

But I wasn't so quick to follow her down the rabbit hole. This industry is a tough one, I told her. No one gets into it to make money. And some people just aren't cut out for this kind of work. Tom could have just decided to move back home, and if I was being honest, that's probably what happened to Claire.¬†

Kelsey reacted as if I had just asked her to come in on a Saturday. I tried to assure her that that didn't have to happen to us, especially if we stuck together and Kelsey showed a little more hustle from time to time. But I only seemed to upset her more. She snatched up her bag and headed for the elevator before I could offer to put in a good word for her with Peter.¬†

Nothing could have kept me in the office after that‚Äînot even birthday cake in the breakroom. I waited just long enough for Kelsey to clear the building and subway, then got in the elevator alone.¬†

One floor down from *Coastline*, the car stopped, and the doors opened. No one was waiting to get on. I expected someone to hurriedly appear, having forgotten the one last email they needed to send and apologizing. But still, no one. I jabbed the close door button as if those ever worked, betraying how badly I wanted to leave. To be anywhere else but here‚Äîwhere I had let down my friend.

A *buzz* from the control panel startled me. Gears ground somewhere above. The elevator began to descend with the doors still open. A stumbled backward and cowered in the corner, as far from the gaping opening as I could get myself.

The floors passed slowly enough to glimpse the empty offices beneath *Coastline*, but too quickly to make an escape. A draft whipped through car with each new level. I tried to stay calm, reminding myself that the gusts were not pulling me closer and closer to the opening. It only felt that way.

A few floors from the lobby, I saw something that convinced me that fear had gotten the better of me. A figure sat cross-legged on the ground, facing the elevator in an almost childlike pose, lit dimly by the faint red light of a distant exit sign. The darkness and the descent didn't allow me much more detail than its ragged outline, a vague sense of its enormity, and the sudden smell of decay.

A chime rang out when the elevator reached the lobby. I still clung to the hand railing above me, my face buried in my shoulder. The security guard asked if I was alright and helped me up. He said he'd call maintenance in the morning.¬†

\*\*\*

I hardly slept that night. Kelsey plagued my thoughts, and my shower curtain door wouldn't close all the way because it had lost a ring. I spent the endless hours longing for sleep, yet dreading the day that slumber would whisk me toward even faster. At four, I gave up and showered. It felt like only moments passed before the subway car was hurdling past me, inches away, promising oblivion on either side of the platform's grooved yellow warning strip.¬†

The office was empty when I got in, and I lost myself in work for a few hours. Whenever a new set of footsteps approached, I braced myself for the slosh of her iced coffee and the crinkle of her take-out bagel bag. But when Kelsey finally did show up, I didn't notice until she was next to me.¬†

""Hey,"" she said, seeming as sleep deprived as I was.¬†

""Hi,"" I said. A weary, commiserative smile was all I could offer.¬†

I like to think she understood.¬†

The drumming started before we could say anything else. The steady beats were high and hollow, as if emanating from an ancient, tightly drawn skin. A voice over the intercom instructed the staff to gather in the conference room for an all-hands meeting. Terror filled Kelsey's eyes, and I applied baseless reassurances as we walked over together. The torrent of whispers around us was unintelligible beyond the fact that no one knew what was happening.

We assumed our positions, standing against the wall while senior staff sat in chairs, and waited for the editor-in-chief. He came in shortly thereafter, a politic expression on his face that was neither too sad nor joyful. His heavy watch thunked on the table when he sat down.¬†

The drumming continued as he spoke. He thanked us for coming on such short notice and said that he had some unfortunate news to share. The finance department had doubts about the forecast for the next fiscal year, so there would need to be cuts. He swore to us that these were his least favorite days, but were some of the most important for securing the future of *Coastline Magazine*. He thanked us again, asked us to keep up the hard work, and requested we return to our seats.

The HR lady was waiting for us in the center of the newsroom as we filed out. In a blunt voice, she ordered us all to resume work and to not‚Äîno matter what‚Äîlook away from our screens.¬†

The room erupted in the sound of keyboards clacking. Through the din, I could hear the elevator rising to our floor, its motor straining loudly against an unusually heavy load. The happy *ding* of the elevator preceded the metallic slide of the opening door and the boom of enormous footfalls entering the office.

A putrid smell, like decaying produce, filled my nostrils. It grew stronger as the footsteps came closer. My eyes locked on my screen, I couldn't see whatever was behind me, but the dimming light told me it was tall. The HR lady explained that she had some questions about our recent performance and implored us to answer honestly.¬†

First, she wanted to know if Josh, directly behind me, had tried to start a union. When he said he had, I heard breaking bones muffle a scream. After Cindy, two seats over, admitted to printing her resume on a *Coastline* copier, her chair flew out of sight, and I never saw her again. Sara, immediately to my right, never stood a chance. She copped to requesting time off during the busy season.¬†

When the thing stopped behind me, a different voice spoke up. Peter cleared his throat and apologized for all of this nastiness. There was just one more question to answer. He wanted to know who I trusted more with the future of *Coastline Magazine*, myself or Kelsey.¬†

In the moment, it took everything I had to not look over to her. Now, I tremble at the thought of what I would have seen.

After it was all over, there was pizza in the conference room, and a few of the senior editors gathered around.

They said I had done well.

They said I showed initiative.

They said I had management potential.¬†",1,1740272864.0,u_MasterSmiley,0,1.0,False

(Day 9 ACL reconstruction on right knee using Patellar Tendon),"This is in reference to a Patellar Tendon  Anterior Cruciate Ligament replacement/reconstruction surgery, no other parts of the knee were messed with and are completely intact and in good health (wishfully). The doctor also gave me a PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma) injection for the sake of healing well. The ACL was torn over a year and a half ago maybe even longer. I was able to adjust just fine without any real noticeable difference, except my other knee and other muscles were always compensating and I would feel the strain, however I could functionally run and maybe even play sports, never really attempted, but with careful consideration for movement I don't think it would be impossible. I decided to get the surgery to prevent any other damage to ligaments and return my knee to proper working function. The first three days were the hardest, Percocet was my absolute best friend, I am just wondering if I am doing everything wrong skipping all the benchmarks and being ignorant. I took the brace off after the first day, and started walking, more like limping, using mainly my right leg and muscles to carry most of the weight on my body. This worked until day 2-3 when all the nerve block wore off and I had to use another means to move around. I understand this is a costly tradeoff, a temporary one albeit and I don't think I can do that much damage in a few days of doing this. Never used crutches never attempted to learn after using them initially to get home from the surgery and having my left leg literally shake with strain, I did not even want to attempt them again.  I did receive a four legged walker however, which this cute nurse offered to throw in without cost. So for the next few days 2-6 I would use this four legged walker to move around, go to the bathroom and shower. Day 7 I still had some pain but was able to move around without the four legged walker while slowly applying some pressure to my right knee, this lead to me beginning to trust my knee in very limited positions. Knowing I would not push my current limits in attempting to run or even climb stairs rapidly. Even though I find know I can climb stairs if I only use my left knee to step up. I am on day 9 and I have been outside on my own twice for a very limited time to grab some coffee. I even drove once for 10 minutes, and did not feel overwhelming pain or safety concern, I find I can basically walk around with a slight limp that comes from me not wanting to over stress my knee with the weight and shifting the weight of my body to no greatly impact the step I make with my right knee. I also believe it is a result of my quad muscles being almost dormant, I also have well developed Cavs (I believe) which I tend to activate to make everything easier. Is this completely backward thinking? Or should I want to walk as much as I can without pushing anything and using pain as metered connection to notify me of when I am approaching the boundaries. Or should I be in bed not moving keeping my knee straight and using the crutches only to get where I need too. My first post op appointment is in two days and my first pt session is in three days. I have been using compression ice therapy, through this machine I got from amazon, its made a world of difference to the swelling pain and healing. I believe it's the reason I  I've recovered this fast. My knee flexion is just below 90 degrees, I've been working on slowly extending it and pushing past my limits, I've found recently that to push it past this applies pressure and pain to my quadriceps muscles (or anything maybe in the immediate area) not as much to the knee directly as it used to be to getting all the way up to this point, shortly under 90 degrees. Any sort of advice, disagreement, criticism is genuinely and unilaterally appreciated.

TLDR: I am walking by myself without crutches on the 9th day of surgery, trusting my knee only in certain positions, using my right legs and left Cavs as muscles to walk. Is this counter intuitive to this operation or is this exactly what I need to be doing. Currently at less than 90 degrees flexion and have only plateaued because of quadriceps pain when pushing it past this.

Recently turned 27, thought I might try this again! 

Looking for a man preferably older than me, or if we vibe then my age but no one younger please! I will ignore ALL messages sent from anyone under 27!

I'm based in London (West specifically but can easily travel around the place) and I don't drive. I work a busy and stressful job so I definitely need to let out some steam and find someone who is also in need of a genuine connection and good vibes. 

I'm white with a soothing and cute voice and a cute face to match. Body wise I would describe myself as average height and with a chubby/curvy build. My personality at first can be shy and introverted but when I meet the right person my personality really shines through and I'm such good fun.

I enjoy good company and my friends would describe as someone with a cat like personality, make of that what you will! 

I'm one hell of a cinophile and adore being indoors snuggling with my cat in the warmth, especially during the colder seasons. Ideally I'd like to snuggle with the cat on one side and a nice man on the other. That would be idyllic. 

I'm a big snob when it comes to coffee, cheese and sweet treats but outside of that, I'm into gaming, anime and a lot more. 

As for a relationship dynamic I'm old school and love it when a man takes charge and is in control of things. It may be odd but I've always loved a more traditional relationship and I like a man being a man in more ways than one!

I am very affectionate and love being spoiled with attention but I need time to open up to the right person! However for the right person I would make you so happy!

I'd like to find someone I can connect with for the purpose of a long term relationship. I hope to one day get married and to start a family, so I hope whoever this post attracts also has similar wants for the future! So I'm not interested in hookups or ONS. Any messages suggesting this will be deleted and blocked.

I'm more than happy to send photos if we have good connection via reddit chat and then share phone numbers to continue chatting over whatsapp. But please... I don't want to play message tennis forever. I want to meet people, not just text!I

I am a massive yapper and would love to meet someone who enjoys to talk and prefers voice messages and calls over text!

1ivxyme,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMaps/comments/1ivxyme/2_issues_with_gm_app_ios/,2 issues with GM app (ios),"There seem to be two fairly recent changes that have messed up the Google Maps app for me.

1. you can't jump straight into map view from a place's (cafe, bar) page 
2. you can't access street view via a place's photos/images section.

So let's start with (1).. if you navigate in google maps to a place like a cafe or a bar, but directly, e.g. someone sent you a link, or from a google search, and you scroll down the location page, the little view of the street map is gone. That was key cos you could tap it and it would show the exact location on the street map. The map is still there in the app, but the problem is if you navigated to the cafe/bar from a direct link, the main map section of the app will just stay put at whatever location you already had open in google maps. There is no easy way to jump to the actual map location of the place you are currently viewing.

And now (2).. So the street view used to be accessible via a place's images/photos section. Where on earth has this gone? That was critical for immediately being able to view the location from street view which is what you want if you're trying to find a place, not pics of cups of coffee. And considering that (1) already makes it impossible to quickly navigate to the street location you're basically stuck :/

Whoever decided to make these changes might want to reconsider. It's badly messed up some of GM's key uses.

It disappeared at my local store after I bought the last bag on the shelf late January. After a couple weeks I called my mom in another city to ask if they had it and if so to buy me a few bags. She luckily got a few, but now it's gone from her store too (final price was $6.69, \~$2 increase from when I started getting it).

Is this a casualty of the rise in bean prices I've been hearing about? Anyone think it's coming back? And can anyone recommend an alternative?",2,1740272028.0,aldi,3,1.0,False

not sure if this is a scam, but someone randomly sent me money.
they sent on january 28th, ‚ÄúMiss you‚Äù. then later that day sent $5 in apple cash with ‚ÄúHave a coffee :)‚Äù.

i ignored these and never used the money in case it could be traced back to me. also, i didn‚Äôt realize my apple pay had auto-accept on so i fear i can‚Äôt just choose whether or not to.

then, today, he said ‚ÄúMiss you‚Äù, an hour or so later said ‚ÄúStill want your Amazon wishlist so I can spoil you‚Äù.

NOW i did reply and said ‚Äúi lost my contacts, who is this?‚Äù just to see if it was the name attached to the number when i looked it up in one of those real people search websites, but it wasn‚Äôt üíî

he replied ‚ÄúChris!‚Äù then ‚ÄúThe anesthesiologist‚Äù AND THEN SENT $10 IN APPLE PAYYY with ‚ÄúMore food moneysss‚Äù

NOW this guy seems creepy but i am also a broke college student. does this seem like a phishing scam? should i try and report it to apple pay and get the money out of my account just to be safe?

I'm M26 and there is a girl (F21) whom I love her. We work at same workplace. We are very good friends and comfortable in talking with each other. 4 months back I asked her out for dinner. She was fine for it but, made some excuses around why not on weekends or after office timings. I felt she clearly made some excuses to avoid. It's fine. Fast forward - till date I've asked her 3-4 times for other things like to drop off home, or grab a coffee in cafe, etc and got responses like she had to go somewhere, she has other plans etc.

Recently I came to know that within her friends circle she flaunts that I'm the guy who approaches her, some other people from workplace also approached her, etc. I've been observing that I'm the first one to initiate any thing in conversation. In-person in office she is the one who approaches to talk. Not sure if she is doing all this only for sake of attention.

From this community - I need help to understand in this situation what should I do. Should I detach myself from her and set boundary keep it a friendship level, nothing more than that ? I feel like the efforts I put for her - she shares them in her friend's circle to flaunt and show the attention she is getting and how attractive she is.",1,1740271755.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False
