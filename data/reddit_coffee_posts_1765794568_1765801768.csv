Nagwowork po kasi ako sa outside seating ng isang coffee shop, when a kid playing and throwing stones hit the screen of my laptop. Nagkacrack yung screen ng laptop kasi natamaan nung pinaglalaruan nyang bato.

The kid was accompanied by her mom. Nung nadinig nila yung bato hitting the screen they immediately went to my area to find out what happened. Fast forward to us going to the police station to file an incident report detailing what happened. She acknowledged the report and left her details with me/the police.

Problem ko now is need ko magpa-quote sa authorized service center kasi gusto kong resolution is maayos yung laptop back to the state it was before mabasag. Kaso dun sa preliminary conversation namin gusto netong mother is split daw kami kasi shared liability daw yun, na accident lang naman daw kasi, and nasa outside seating area daw ako ng public place.

I don’t agree with her kasi I think she was negligent and shouldn’t have let her kid throw rocks in the first place. Even if I was seated outdoors, we were still in a private cafe where people working can be the norm. Actually madami nga kaming nagwowork dun (pati yung mother, she was just seated inside).

1pn5yj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropshipping/comments/1pn5yj8/i_tested_290_different_ad_hooks_the_winners_all/,I Tested 290 Different Ad Hooks - The Winners All Had This 'Cognitive Dissonance Pattern',"I need to tell you about the most expensive sentence I ever wrote.

""Tired of razors that don't work?""

Cost me $4,200 in ad spend. Got 340,000 impressions. 2,100 clicks. 7 sales.

Meanwhile, my competitor ran: ""Your razor works fine. Here's why you need a new one anyway.""

Same product. Same audience. Same budget.

They did $28,000 in revenue.

I wanted to quit marketing and become a monk.

**The Part Where I Lost My Mind Over Sentences**

Here's what broke me: I'm decent at copywriting. I've written hundreds of ads. I know the formulas. Problem-agitate-solve. Features-advantages-benefits. AIDA. All of it.

But nothing was working consistently.

So I did what any rational person would do: I spent nine months testing hooks. Not full ads. Just the opening sentence. The first thing people see.

I tested 290 different hooks across 12 different products. Tracked everything obsessively. Click-through rates, conversion rates, cost per acquisition, scroll depth, video completion rates.

Here's what happened: 263 hooks performed between 0.8% and 1.9% CTR. Basically the same. Mediocre across the board.

But 27 hooks? They averaged 4.7% CTR and 3.2x better conversion rates.

What made those 27 different? That question cost me $31,000 in testing to answer.

**The Pattern Nobody Talks About**

After analyzing all 290 hooks, I found something weird. The winners weren't following the copywriting formulas I learned. They were doing something completely different.

They were creating cognitive dissonance in the first sentence.

Let me explain what I mean because this changed everything.

**Cognitive dissonance** is when your brain holds two conflicting beliefs at the same time. It creates mental discomfort. Your brain HAS to resolve it. It's not a choice. It's involuntary.

Most hooks try to validate what you already believe. ""Tired of expensive razors?"" assumes you already think razors are too expensive. If you don't already believe that, the hook does nothing.

But hooks that create cognitive dissonance do the opposite. They challenge something you believe is true. Your brain can't ignore it.

Here's a real example that crushed it for a sleep supplement:

**Bad hook (validated existing belief):** ""Can't fall asleep? Try this natural supplement."" Result: 1.2% CTR, 1.8% conversion

**Good hook (created cognitive dissonance):** ""You're not tired. Your brain just won't shut up."" Result: 5.1% CTR, 4.3% conversion

Same product. Same targeting. Completely different results.

Why did it work? Because it contradicts the obvious assumption. If you can't sleep, you assume you're tired. The hook says ""no, you're not tired."" Your brain goes ""wait, what?"" and needs to resolve that conflict.

**The Three Types of Cognitive Dissonance Hooks**

After testing 290 hooks, I found three distinct patterns that create this mental conflict. Each works for different situations.

***Pattern 1: The Belief Contradiction***

This is when you directly contradict something the reader believes to be true.

I tested this with a posture corrector. Standard hook was ""Fix your posture with this device."" Got 1.4% CTR.

Changed it to ""Your posture is fine. Your chair is the problem."" Hit 4.9% CTR.

Why? Because everyone with back pain assumes their posture is bad. Telling them their posture is fine creates instant dissonance. They have to click to resolve it.

I tested 47 variations of belief contradiction hooks. The ones that performed best contradicted OBVIOUS beliefs, not obscure ones. If someone has to think about whether they believe something, the hook fails.

Another example for a productivity app:

Bad: ""Get more done with better time management"" Good: ""You don't have a time problem. You have a priority problem.""

The second one contradicts the obvious assumption that productivity is about managing time. Instant mental conflict.

***Pattern 2: The Expected Outcome Reversal***

This is when you flip the expected cause-and-effect relationship.

Tested this with a skincare product. Normal hook: ""Want clear skin? Fix your skincare routine."" Got 1.6% CTR.

Changed to ""Your skin isn't breaking out because of your routine. It's breaking out because your routine is too good."" Hit 5.3% CTR and sold out in 4 days.

Works because people expect ""bad skin = bad routine."" Saying their routine is TOO good flips causation and creates dissonance.

I analyzed 89 successful ""outcome reversal"" hooks. They all shared one thing: they took the assumed cause and made it the problem, not the solution.

Another example for a business course:

Bad: ""Struggling to get clients? Learn better marketing."" Good: ""You're not struggling because you're bad at marketing. You're struggling because you're too good at it.""

The reversal forces curiosity. How can being too good be the problem?

***Pattern 3: The Status Validation + Pivot***

This is the sneakiest one. You validate their current state, then introduce conflict.

I tested this with a fitness program. Standard hook: ""Want to lose weight? Try this workout plan."" Got 1.3% CTR.

Changed to ""You don't need to lose weight. You need to lose the guilt about not losing weight."" Hit 4.8% CTR.

Why does this work? Because it validates where they are RIGHT NOW, which lowers resistance. Then it introduces a new problem they didn't know they had.

I tested 62 variations of this pattern. The key is the validation has to be genuine, not sarcastic. If it feels like you're mocking them, it backfires completely.

Another example for a productivity tool:

Bad: ""Stop procrastinating and get things done"" Good: ""You're not procrastinating. You're protecting yourself from failure by staying busy with unimportant tasks.""

Validates that they're working hard, then introduces the real problem.

**Why This Works (And Why It Fails)**

Here's where most people mess this up: they think cognitive dissonance means ""be contrarian"" or ""hot takes.""

Wrong.

I tested 83 ""contrarian"" hooks that created dissonance but failed. They all made the same mistake: the dissonance didn't lead to the product solution.

Example of cognitive dissonance that FAILED:

""Your morning coffee is destroying your productivity"" (for a productivity app)

Got 6.2% CTR but 0.4% conversion. Why? Because the dissonance led people to think about coffee, not the app. The mental conflict resolved in the wrong direction.

The hook has to create dissonance that ONLY your product can resolve. If someone can resolve the conflict without your product, you just entertained them but didn't sell anything.

I analyzed all 27 winning hooks. Every single one had dissonance that created a path directly to the product solution. No other resolution made sense.

**The Framework That Actually Works**

After burning $31,000 testing this, I built a system to create cognitive dissonance hooks that actually convert.

Step one is identifying the ""obvious belief"" your market holds about their problem. Not what YOU think they believe. What they actually believe. I survey customers and read comment sections obsessively to find this.

Step two is contradicting that belief in a way that's uncomfortable but not offensive. The dissonance should make them think ""wait, really?"" not ""this is bullshit.""

Step three is ensuring the resolution path leads ONLY to your product. If they can resolve the dissonance by buying a competitor or doing nothing, your hook is entertainment, not marketing.

I tested this framework across 12 different products after developing it. Success rate went from 9% (27 out of 290) to 68% (41 out of 60 new hooks tested).

**Real Examples That Crushed It**

Let me give you specific hooks that worked with actual performance data.

For a meal kit service: ""You're not too busy to cook. You're too busy planning what to cook."" - 4.9% CTR, 3.8% conversion

For a project management tool: ""Your team isn't missing deadlines because they're disorganized. They're disorganized because the deadlines are unrealistic."" - 5.4% CTR, 4.1% conversion

For a financial planning app: ""You don't have a spending problem. You have an awareness problem."" - 5.7% CTR, 5.2% conversion

For an email marketing tool: ""Your emails aren't going to spam because of your content. They're going to spam because your sending pattern looks like a robot."" - 6.1% CTR, 4.7% conversion

Each one contradicts the obvious assumption, creates mental conflict, and points directly at the product as the resolution.

**The Database I Built From This.**

https://i.redd.it/3xdc3x7z0d7g1.gif

After nine months testing 290 hooks, I couldn't just walk away. I started collecting every high-performing hook I could find from other brands.

Built a database of over 3,500 categorized hooks with their performance data. Organized by the three cognitive dissonance patterns, by industry, by product type, by funnel stage.

Each hook includes the CTR, conversion rate, what belief it contradicts, why it creates dissonance, and what type of product it works for. 

Plus the psychological framework explaining exactly why each pattern works based on cognitive science research.

There's also a hook-to-product matching system showing which pattern fits your specific product situation. 

Because belief contradiction works better for problem-aware markets. Outcome reversal works better for solution-aware markets. Status validation works better for skeptical markets.

And A/B test results showing what happens when you change just one word in a cognitive dissonance hook. Sometimes ""problem"" vs ""challenge"" changes CTR by 40%.

Because here's what I learned: cognitive dissonance hooks aren't about being clever or contrarian. 

They're about understanding what your market believes and strategically challenging it in a way that creates an irresistible path to your product.

**If you want the complete High-Performance Hook Database - all 3,500+ hooks categorized with performance data, the cognitive psychology framework, and the hook-to-product matching system - let me know in the comments and I'll share the link.**

It's not a swipe file of random hooks. It's a system showing you exactly which type of cognitive dissonance to create for your specific product and market.

So pure, its very color is different.

Gale is presented to us not as some lesser chemist, but as someone very much on-par with Walter in abilities and talent (see his chemically perfect coffee). Even Walter, in his huge ego, can respect his obvious competence and sees him as an equal.

This raises the question on why Gus needed Walter in the first place. Gale, given some test runs in the lab, should be able to also reach extremely high purity and possibly blue meth. The more reasonable approach for Gus would then be to have Walter killed and make it look like an accident (very doable for Gus) instead of hiring him, to get rid of his competition.

The standard answer is that Gus was merely using Walt as a temporary source until Gale could reverse-engineer the formula, which he eventually did. But even this seems like an unnecessary risk given how volatile Walt is, making Gus's initial decision a plothole of risk management, especially given how Gus is otherwise very risk-averse and even allowed Walter to know his identity from the get-go.",2,1765800695.0,breakingbad,5,0.63,False

1pn5sqt,https://i.redd.it/dn39fm3pzc7g1.jpeg,How did Canada’s young people become its unhappiest generation?,"VANCOUVER — As a teen growing up in Toronto, Bhavik Sharma imagined what life would look like at 25.

He and his high school friends would be starting families. They’d be on six-figure salaries and living comfortably.

Now 27, he’s back living with his parents in Kitchener, Ont., driven out of Toronto by high rent and other costs.

“I think back then, in that generation, it was definitely a lot easier,” Sharma said of the path to adulthood for his parents, who moved to Canada from India about 30 years ago.

“You’d get your job, you would save up, you’d get a house, you could invest in business.”

Now, as he saves for the down payment on his first home, Sharma understands those things come later for many in his generation. And everything costs more, he said, from housing to food.

Sharma is among a generation of Canadians whose idea of a dream life could be in a state of “flux,” researchers say, forcing them to reconsider what it means, and what it takes, to be happy.

From families to finances, benchmarks are happening later for Canada’s young — and their happiness levels have been plummeting.

The World Happiness Report says Canadians under 30 were the happiest age group in the country as recently as 2011.

Now, they’re the unhappiest.

The 2024 edition of the decades-long study of global happiness, published by the Wellbeing Research Centre at the University of Oxford, asked participants to picture their life as a ladder, with the best possible life at 10 and the worst at zero.

While many countries among the 134 covered by the research have also seen happiness levels fall among those under 30 since 2006, the slide of young Canadians down the ladder is exceptional.

https://wellbeing.hmc.ox.ac.uk/news/world-happiness-report-2024/

Only four countries have seen a worse decline — Jordan, Venezuela, Lebanon and Afghanistan.

Yet, over all age groups, Canada ranked the 15th happiest country. In the 2025 report — which did not contain the same level of detail about young people as last year’s report — Canada ranked 18th.

Anthony McCanny, the lead author of the separate 2024 Canadian Happiness Report, published by the University of Toronto’s Population and Well-being Lab, said young Canadians are reconfiguring expectations.

https://cheung.artsci.utoronto.ca/canadian-happiness-report-2024/

“We had a vision about what becoming an adult meant in terms of your job, and your financial security and having a home,” he said.

“Exactly what it looks like to reach that later stage of life is changing.”

Young people across Canada interviewed by The Canadian Press described the challenge of building lives they once imagined, bogged down by an unaffordable housing market, struggles to save for the future, online gloom and a growing youth mental health crisis.

Fitness instructor Taylor Arnt of Winnipeg, 27, said she’s processing the idea she might never get married or have children, as she grapples with day-to-day challenges.

Ontario graduate Thivian Varnacumaaran, 25, applied for more than 400 jobs before finding work and considers living with his parents a privilege.

Communications CEO Kathryn LeBlanc, 31, spoke of the demands of the 24-hour news cycle.

And some in a B.C. mental health program told of limited support.

Many also spoke of finding ways to be happy in the moment, even if their lives haven’t yet turned out the way they pictured.

“I am happy, yeah,” said Sharma. Family, friends, vacations and balancing work expectations bring him joy.

“I try to stay positive.”

Demise of the U-shaped trajectory

Before 2014, well-being in Canada could be broadly described as a U-shaped trajectory. Satisfaction was high among youth, declined to a low point in mid-life, then rose again as people got older.

John Helliwell, an emeritus professor of economics at the University of British Columbia and a founding editor of the World Happiness Report, said that U-shape is no more.

“The happiness of the young has dropped sufficiently far ... below that of the middle-aged that used to be the least happy. It’s now the young and then the middle-aged, and then the uprising at the end is still there.”

Helliwell said social and economic conditions are not seen by today’s young as promising, unlike previous generations.

“The chances of getting a job and the chances of getting a job with a future — that’s one dimension. And the other is the price of housing,” he said.

“Where you live is a very important part of how you feel about your life. Feelings of economics and residential security clearly (are) important to happiness, so uncertainty about either of those aspects of life is going to play in a negative way.”

In 2023, the Bank of Canada’s housing affordability index hit its worst level in 41 years. While it has eased, it remains at levels akin to the early 1990s, when interest rates were more than nine per cent.

The situation has been particularly acute for Canada’s young.

Non-profit Generation Squeeze says that in 1986, it took five years for a typical 25-to-34-year-old to save for a 20 per cent down payment on a representative home in Canada.

By 2021, it took 17 years. And in the greater Vancouver and Toronto areas, it was 27.

Other life benchmarks have been shifting, too.

Statistics Canada says the average age of marriage has steadily increased, from 25 in 1968 to 35 in 2019. (Data since has been skewed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which StatCan says saw many delay marriage plans).

Over the same period, the agency says the average age of first-time mothers rose from 22 to 29, while the average age of all mothers rose to nearly 32 in 2024, up from almost 27 in 1976.

“A lot of people don’t prioritize love, kids, as much as they used to,” said Violet Rode, an 18-year-old theatre student at Montreal’s Dawson College.

“And because of the money thing, people aren’t having as many kids, people aren’t going out as on many dates.”

Varnacumaaran, now working as an electrical designer in Markham, Ont., said he longed for his own family and children one day.

But for now, he’s focused on saving, as he lives with his parents.

“I don’t want to spend on unnecessary things, so I try my best to do that,” said Varnacumaaran.

Arnt recently lost her job as a policy analyst and is working as a contracted consultant and group fitness instructor. She said many young people can’t have the same timeline as older generations, whether with marriage, children or financial goals.

“It’s really difficult to plan for a future and think about those goals when you’re struggling to meet your day-to-day basic needs.”

‘Adapting to a new way the world is’

Following the release of the 2024 World Happiness Report, Canadian researchers looked closely at the numbers and confirmed the findings.

But they say the size of the happiness decline among young Canadians could depend on how they were questioned.

McCanny, lead author of the Canadian Happiness Report, said the global study asked people to compare their current life to the best possible life they could be living.

When Statistics Canada asked Canadian youth how satisfied they were currently, the decline in happiness was significantly less dramatic, he said.

Statistics Canada’s Canadian Community Health Surveys found a modest decline in satisfaction for young people from 8.2 in 2015 to 7.9 in 2021, the Canadian report said.

McCanny, 32, called the differences in questions a thin but possibly significant distinction. He said it’s possible the age group is “just in flux.”

“We’re adapting to a new way the world is, which certainly can be very hard to do. But also, when we do ask people if they feel satisfied with their lives, they also say yes,” he said.

“So that does seem to be some indication that things maybe are not entirely bad.”

The social and online environment occupied by today’s young people may be one of those new worlds.

Rode said her generation struggles with their attention span. Social media hampers mental health “one-hundred-thousand-million per cent.”

“Depending on what you’re feeding yourself online, it really changes the way you think,” she said.

Thirty-one-year-old LeBlanc, from Winnipeg, said her generation is expected to be more plugged in than those before.

“It’s like the 24/7 news cycle but on steroids, as we have obligations from work and also algorithms sort of pulling us back in.”

The pull to answer emails creeps into her nights and weekends, she said. Working at a communications firm specializing in social advocacy, it’s easy to have online notifications always turned on.

“If I didn’t put up boundaries, I would work every minute of every day,” said LeBlanc.

Helliwell said data is being collected on social media use and the impact on happiness.

He noted that the decline in happiness among Canadian youth has been smaller in Quebec. Since 2014, it’s slightly up, said the Canadian Happiness Report.

Helliwell remains optimistic for a couple reasons.

He said happiness researchers have found reality is often a lot better than people think. In tests where wallets are dropped to see if they’re returned, people are pessimistic — but twice as many wallets are handed back than people expect.

A key component of being happy where you live is a feeling of community, Helliwell said. His advice: “step out of yourself and get out of your gloom,” and do a small thing to improve the world around you.

“It’s creating the better world yourself by paying more attention to the people you should be paying attention to, by connecting more readily with those around you in positive ways,” he said.

“It’s as simple as the traffic wave ... this kind of generalized friendliness has a huge ripple effect.”

Helliwell also said the speed at which happiness has declined is a sign it can be improved.

“Anything that happens that quickly about how people think, it isn’t genetic, it isn’t permanent. It isn’t about life as a whole,” he said.

Nicholas Schorn, 32, a writer who works in a Vancouver café, said they’re in “turmoil” for reasons including the cost of housing, financial and job security, and a lack of support for people working in the arts.

Yet life is “decently happy” for Schorn, who finds comfort in community spaces like a local coffee shop, as well as “soul-nourishing” volunteer work as a mover, helping women leave abusive relationships.

Instead of focusing on distant “green hills,” like home ownership or a secure job, Schorn has drawn their sights closer.

“I’m less so imagining myself when I’m … retired and more so imagining myself like in a couple years,” Schorn said.

“The green hills are like, starting a new (Dungeons & Dragons) campaign or finishing this short story that I’m writing, seeing my family at Christmas, reading a new book.”

This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 15, 2025.

1pn5rtb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1pn5rtb/my_ex_and_i_broke_up_last_night_it_was_the_most/,"My ex and I broke up last night. It was the most amazing way it could have ended, and it fucking sucks","No one can really encapsulate how heartbreaking it truly is to be dumped but know that you both love each other deeply and intensely until you experience it yourself. 

Feel free not to read this, I'm just in a weird, numb phase and thought that writing it down might help, and who knows, maybe many of you will relate with an exact same/similar scenario. Maybe some advice, I don't know how to feel anymore.

He asked to meet up and I already knew where it was heading. We went to a coffee shop, he paid for the drinks. We were in that coffee shop for what felt like hours, just in our own bubble of silence, I was afraid to speak and he was just quietly contemplating and I could sense some conflicting thoughts in his mannerisms. But I just took in everything he said, I somehow wasn't tearing up when he was trying to speak, still conflicted, tearing up. He hadn't said the words yet but I could tell he was alluding to it. I somehow slipped a joke in there, lightened the whole mood, then we were kind of talking about it and also him talking to me about being really confused about what he wants and what he thinks is what we need for the relationship. I was really tempted to try and change his mind, I was so tempted to just push him a little bit to change his mind, fight him on it, but I just couldn't. I just kept saying that I can only control my behavior and my actions, if he has a different thing in his mind, then I can't control or change that. I don't know if he liked that, it seemed like he was more confused. I had that glimmer of hope, until he actually said it. 

He asked if we break up, would I still block him on everything? I don't usually lie in our relationship, but this time I did, I said I would. He said he doesn't want to lose what deep friendship and connection we had, I didn't even need to say anything and he said that that was 'part of the deal, I guess'. He said that he felt like we were becoming codependent and prioritizing the relationship over anything else, like our growth, our careers (we're young, in our 20s), I just said that I think I can grow in the relationship, become more self-realized, and become independent, but I still backtracked and said that I know what I said wouldn't change anything, so it's just an opinion. He finally said that we should split up. I said okay. He said he wished I was less understanding. I just smiled and cried. 

And then we got drinks, I asked impulsively, telling him that I didn't want to end the night yet, and he immediately agreed and we went.

That few hours in that bar, I felt like I could reside there forever, slow sips, accidental touches, the crumbs of what we were, still remnant, which made the experience enjoyable, which is the worst of them all. We had no conflict, we had no hatred, just pure love, but different paths. We joked about being exes, he paid for drinks, I said we should split it, he said no, I said well we're split up now, so he doesn't owe me anything now, he thought it was a pun and we laughed. We caught up on our lives, what we watched, what we did (we didn't see each other for a week before we met up to break up). He held my hand, he almost called me by our pet name, before he realized and stopped himself. Force of habit. The more drinks in our system, the more the accidental touches came. Before we stop ourselves and realize. 

He referenced my favorite movie, saying that we should meet each other in 6 months, exactly on that date and time, but 6 months later. To which, I disagreed. I told him I can't have that because I will just focus on it. Which is the complete opposite of what he wants in this break-up. I asked him to block me on everything, and he said he didn't want to. He said he'll block me on everything except email if I really wanted him to. Of course not, he was, still is, the love of my life.

I was honest and said that some of what he's saying feels a bit unfair and he's leaving crumbs and thus, glimmers of hope that we reconcile and be together. He apologized and said that I was right, but that it was what he was feeling at the moment.

In between all the laughs, we mention the things we won't be able to do together, while also teasing that we could still do them, as 'friends'. We couldn't do things we planned on doing anymore, we couldn't watch movies he wanted to show me. We couldn't finish shows we started together. We joked about so many things that we'll miss from each other, and with the laughs, came the tears that I couldn't stop from coming out. We have lived so much in such a short amount of time, it feels incomplete.

'Bloom' by The Paper Kites played when we exited the bar, how aptly and cruelly cliche of the universe.

He said that I was the best he's ever had, and he had never been happier than when he was with me. It sounds cruel to hear from someone who dumped you, but I knew that he was being genuine. He said he'll never stop loving me, but I don't know. 

All I got from the goodbye we had was that it seemed like he was really conflicted on what to do. But as the night kept going, it seemed like he was sure? Hurts to admit but I think that was what happened.

I'm still in denial of it all, even he admitted that he thinks he's in denial and hasn't 'hit him' yet. He said that it'll hit him when something happens to him and he realizes he won't be able to tell me about it.

I, somehow, am still hopeful. Which is ironic because I wasn't all that optimistic with other aspects of my life, but as soon as we ended it, it felt like I was hopeful of being okay or being with him again. Don't get me wrong, I am hopeful, but I am not expectant. I can only wish he change his mind, but that's not my business anymore, that's up to him to decide.

I can't help but want to wait for him, even just for a little while. I feel like subconsciously, we can't possibly lose each other. But, that's just wishful thinking, I guess.

To anyone who was reached this far down the post, thank you for reading to my unbridled jargon of thoughts as I try to remember the last moments of my best relationship.

And he doesn't have reddit, but if this somehow reaches him, I'll wait, and grow in the mean time, I can only hope to see you again.",3,1765800488.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1pn5kvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/1pn5kvn/beware_thin_arguments_that_claim_abcds/,"Beware thin ""arguments"" that claim ABCDs discriminate against FOBs","Recently there was an inflammatory post claiming with **zero evidence** that ABCDs supposedly discriminate against FOBs.

In the post, the OP used NO *arguments, no examples and no evidence*.

**Typical** of those those trying to advance the **long debunked stereotype against ABCDs** that they are ""bigoted"" against FOBs.

It's actually *par for the course* for someone trading in this kind of accusation.  It's an attempt to *assume something into reality*.

Let's look at what actually happens.  Take an average workplace.  I have several decades of experience with this.  Your average FOB will 'take what he gets' when it comes to how whites treat him.  **MOST whites will ignore him, some will give him a dirty look, some will act like he's not there the whole time they work together.**

FOB's reaction: ""**This is fine.”** (envision dog drinking coffee with flames all around him)

In the same workplace, ABCDs great the FOB, welcome him, make small talk.  One ABCD doesn't- perhaps because he's busy, for whatever reason.  Suddenly the FOB is aggrieved- ""I'm discriminated against!"".

How could this individual visit such an indignity on him?!   I've seen this dozens of times.  **The FOB's expectations for ABCDs are impossibly high**\- almost searching for victimhood in the interaction.   Meanwhile, his expectation for whites are low- so that every true indignity is written off as an expected 'cost of immigrating'.

Are there cases where ABCD's mistreat FOBs; of course there are.  Are they any more common then any other mistreatment between people?  My experience is no.   **It's that FOB's have unrealistic expectations of treatment by other SA's.**

*In some cases, I have seen FOB's mistreated by white co-workers to the point they search for some ABCD who is short of garrulous with them, and displaces his resentment on this person for being ""arrogant"".*

Meanwhile, most whites dismiss the FOB, esp in social invites and exchanges; but the **FOB will seize upon one or two whites who befriend them and overvalue it to the point they claim ""whites are better to me""** while conveniently ignoring the other 98 who don't bother to interact with them.

*So we must understand the dynamic for what it is.*

Whether we like to admit or not, Indian immigrants make a Faustian Pact when they come to America.  They willingly accept the racism that is rife in the American workplace, particularly by whites, and they agree to ""look the other way"" for a higher paycheck.

In any society, you will have some social evaluation by others in the degree to which you comply with social norms.  Indian immigrants will score low in that regard, esp. when they first come.

So when people do distance themselves from FOBs, some of that is to be expected.  **Whats different is that ABCDs disregard that dynamic more often than whites to befriend FOBs**, but in the cases where they don't, their failure to do so, is faulted FAR MORE by FOBs than when whites do the same.",27,1765799871.0,ABCDesis,3,0.82,False

1pn5j0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditHorrorStories/comments/1pn5j0g/written_in_dread/,Written In Dread,"Piper was born into a family of detectives. When each member of the Starling family came of age, coordinates appeared on their wrists, leading them to their first case. It seemed unusual to Piper until she turned sixteen, and numbers directing her to *Gibraltar Point* *Lighthouse* appeared.

She knew the story behind this lighthouse. Its first keeper, John Paul Radelmüller, had been murdered there in 1815 by local soldiers. As to why he had been murdered, there were two versions. One says John sold the soldiers diluted liquor, and when they found out they had been cheated, they went back for revenge. Another tells that he was serving the soldiers at his home, and when he decided to close the shop early, a deadly fight ensued.

Nothing was concrete on how he met his true end. Though it would make for one hell of a ghost story if it were haunted. Piper knew the murder from the 1800s wouldn't be what she was meant to solve. She hoped so, at least. That morning, she packed her hiking gear, got into her 1972 AMC Gremlin, and headed towards her destination.

As for the curse or gift of the Starlings, Piper wasn't sure when it started or why. Those who would know the answer aren't around anymore. Piper started out at the vast stretch of road ahead of her, listening to classic hits on the radio. Piper drummed her fingers on the steering wheel, then flicked the switch to turn right and onto a dirt road. Ahead of her was the lighthouse. She gazed at the looming building ahead.

Piper felt the heavy weight of the situation heavily on her shoulders.

Finding a safe place to park the car, Piper got out, grabbed her bag, and locked the car. She trudged up the path. It was overgrown except for a few manicured hedges lining the way winding up to the top. Here it was, *Gibraltar Point Lighthouse*. She was sure that in its heyday, this lighthouse was a remarkable sight; now, it was no longer operational. Piper took a deep breath and exhaled, her eyes scanning over her surroundings.

She needed to set up camp. So, Piper pushed open the heavy wooden door of the lighthouse and entered inside. It had been well preserved inside, showing it was well taken care of. Piper found a spot on the second floor and set up her pop-up tent. From here, she would be able to access the telescope to view what was all around her.

Piper sat everything up and began her ascent up the stairs. On the balcony was a rusty telescope hanging on for dear life. Well, at least the lenses aren't broken, she thought to herself, lifting its neck and peering into it. Moving it around, Piper spotted something out of place. Someone had dug a trench in the back of the lighthouse.

Curious, she grabbed a flashlight and headed outside. Her boots crunched on dead leaves underfoot as she made her way towards the trench. There, at the bottom of it, was a pile of bodies, all in various stages of decomposition. This was a serial killer's dumping ground.

Piper needed to call the police. Reaching for her phone, she paused, hearing something being dragged along the ground. Turning off her flashlight, she hid behind an old oak tree. The source of the dragging came from an individual who was dragging a tightly wrapped body.

Stopping at the edge of the trench, they used their foot to kick the heavy bundle into the trench. It bounced off one of the many others that were already lying at the bottom. A sickening squish and crunch echoed out of the hole.

This had to be who was dumping bodies into the trench. Taking out a compact mirror, Piper kept in her back pocket, to fix her makeup. Piper angled the mirror so she could see the bank above the trench. Someone dressed in all black and a mask covering their face stood there staring down into the trench before turning on their heel and walking away.

It was at a time like this that Piper wished she had brought a proper weapon. The use of pepper spray and a taser could give her time to run away but not stun them long enough for authorities to arrive. Since she would be out here for a while, Piper needed to hatch a plan to immobilize this serial killer and have the police stationed close by to make the arrest.

Her gut feeling told her that this was her first case. Something Piper would have to solve herself. Not hearing any more movement, she made her way back to the lighthouse and shut the door behind her.

Tossing and turning in her sleeping bag, Piper stared up at the ceiling of her tent. She couldn't sleep. It was understandable. After all, there was a hole with dead bodies in the backyard of the lighthouse. Who could sleep with something like that in their backyard? Sitting up, Piper rubbed her face and yawned, crawling out of the tent. It's time for some coffee since she won't be getting any sleep tonight.

Waiting for the kettle to heat up on a mini gas stove, Piper shoveled a few spoonfuls of instant coffee and powdered creamer mix into a mug. When it whistled, she took it off and poured the water into her cup, flipping the off switch. Stirring the mixture, Piper blew on the steaming liquid before taking a sip. She walked up to one of the windows, gazing out of it. Down below, she saw an old trail leading somewhere out of sight.

If Piper had to guess, it led to an old shed that stored tools, supplies, and firewood. A knock on the front door of the lighthouse startled her. Her heart jumped into her throat as she shakily put down the coffee mug in her hands. Piper slowly walked over to a bag and took out her taser, slowly descending the stairs. She hid the device behind her back, slowly opening the door for a crack.

Outside was a young man who was close to her age. He was dressed like he had just jumped out of an '80s grunge magazine. Scrunching her nose at his taste in clothing, Piper questioned him about what he was doing there. He simply replied that he had seen a light while following a trail close by. In other words, he was nosey as to who was there.

Could this be the person who Piper witnessed dumping a body earlier? And—just how many of those kills were his? He gripped the door, trying to pry it out of Piper's grasp, so she put her foot and weight against the door. Again, she questioned what he was doing there. His eyes darkened, and in a faint voice, he responded to her that he knew she had seen him. Saw what exactly? Piper played dumb, but she knew better. She just hoped that this individual would believe her.

Loosening his grip on the door, he let go of it and stepped back. He watched Piper closely. Hands in his pockets, his eyes dark and void of any emotion. He turned on his heel and walked down one of the trails next to the lighthouse. Piper knew that he wasn't really gone and that he was going around to the back.

She would have to get there before he would. If Piper didn't, she was sure he would break down the door. Somehow, she felt that this young man knew. He knew that Piper saw what he had been doing and was going to silence her. Quickly shuffling down the stairs, her heart hammered in her chest just as the back door burst open.

Piper cursed under her breath. Where could she go from here? She had to think fast before he closed in on her. As the young man stepped into the lighthouse, Piper went right into the living room. Heavy thudding footsteps followed behind her, getting close enough to grab her.

He reached out to grab Piper when she remembered the taser in her pocket. Turning her body, she flipped the switch on. Aiming it at the young man, she pressed the button, jamming it under his ribs. The sound of crackling filled the air, and just as he was about to wrap his hands around her neck. His body jolted and shook, bringing him to his knees.

Piper didn't pull the taser away, not until she knew he wouldn't be able to get up. Once he was down on the floor, she ran out the door, making a beeline for her car. Piper fumbled with the keys of the car and managed to open it, getting inside. Limping out of the house, the young man's arm was across his ribs as she started the engine and backed out of the driveway. Her foot accelerated on the gas, and she watched him using her rearview mirror.

Speeding out of the driveway like a bat out of hell, Piper fixed her eyes back on the road, knuckles white from her grip on the steering wheel. She needed to put distance between them until she got a few miles away to call the police and her family. Piper never realized a second figure in the back seat of her car. Forgetting the most crucial rule she had been taught. That serial killers don't always work alone.",1,1765799698.0,RedditHorrorStories,0,1.0,False
1pn5i4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcirclejerk/comments/1pn5i4a/why_isnt_there_a_white_girl_history_month_by/,Why Isn’t There A White Girl History Month? By Nicole Mullen,"Ugh, February has to be, like, the worst month. The Absolute Worst. 

You just can’t even with winter anymore, you’re never quite sure how many days it has or how its spelled, Valentine’s Day is always fucked up by some douchebag guy, and on top of all that, Black people get their own month.

Now, look, I know that sounds racist, but I’m not racist. I’m not mad that Black people have their own month because I don’t think they deserve it – I’m mad because when I hear “Black history month,” I’m just reminded that it’s 2014 and I still don’t have my own month. I love Black people. I love rap and the power it has to shift cultures – for example, the legalization of gay marriage after Macklemore’s Grammy-winning ode to equality, Same Love. Thank you, Black people, that shit is really fucking cool, and you did it! Good for you. But, can we cool it with this month shit? As soon as February rolls around you sound like this dumb skank Kayla I work with that has to remind everyone that her birthday is in three weeks.

“Woo, it’s my birthday month!”

That’s great Kayla! I know it’s your special month but maybe you could just, like, try a little harder not to run your sausage fingers along the inside of the coffee maker when you make a pot? It’s kind of gross and I don’t want to think about your dicks-for-hands man-mitts while I’m sipping this Maxwell House “French roast” that I think is just a euphemism for “smells like burning garbage and body odor.” But, happy birthday, I’m so happy for you!

What I’m saying is, don’t be Kayla about it, Black people. I’m glad you have your own month, and I fully support you, but Black people are doing a whole lot better, and they still get a month. Sure, Black people had it hard for a long time, but we have a Black president now. I’m not saying racism is dead, but it’s certainly not doing too well anymore. We’ve beaten it, set it on fire, and dragged it behind our trucks. Racism isn’t dead, but it’s only being artificially preserved with life support systems in Texas, just waiting to be unplugged, being kept alive so the little retarded racism fetus growing inside of it might have a chance to be the racism messiah that backwards assholes are so desperately waiting for.

You see, these days, white girls are just as oppressed as Black people. This isn’t just my opinion either -statistically speaking, white girls are in the same tier as Black men in the privilege hierarchy. Just look at this chart I found on Tumblr: https://web.archive.org/web/20140201164437im\_/http://thoughtcatalog.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/screen-shot-2014-02-01-at-11-01-15-am.png?w=584

This is why I am proposing White Girl History Month.

Cue the tiaras and confetti. LMFAO’s Party Rock starts playing. We all flip our hair and loop our heels around our purse straps. Google’s logo changes to look like Greek sorority letters, and the O’s are Katy Perry and Jennifer Lawrence doing duck-face. 

The thing is: we deserve it! Not deserve it in the sense that we fought long and hard for it, but deserve in the sense that we stuck to our diet all week and we can cheat today because, really, who can live without Chipotle? We deserve it in the fun, put your hair up in a bun and watch Scandal for nine hours kind of way. Nine whole hours, sitting on the couch, refusing to give up our seat, in defiance of the dog that needs to be walked or the dishes that need to be washed, like the Rosa Parks of women.

White girls have done so much for culture and society, and continue to do so, but I think the most important aspect of white girls is that we are ultimately the arbiters of assimilation. White girls are often accused of “appropriating” aspects of minority cultures and for some reason this is seen as a bad thing. There’s a big difference between cultural appropriation and theft. When a white girl goes to yoga, she’s not “stealing” yoga from Indian people, she’s just doing fucking yoga. It’s not like Indian people have to stop doing yoga because white girls are doing it now. 

If anything, Indian people in western culture should see it as a good thing that white girls do yoga. We make it less “weird,” and help transition American culture from the white bread pantheon of mayonnaise and mommy blogs into the diversified, beautifully cohesive amalgam of culture that defines hip American youth. Do you really think yoga would be anything other than smelly one-player twister if it weren’t for white girls deeming it a feminist version of pushups? You think bubble tea wouldn’t just be some gross, Chinese, second rate Jamba Juice if we couldn’t drink it while walking around Sephora? Get real. White girls take the flavorless discordance of the melting pot and we turn into something that tastes fucking good. We put Cholula in our Pho, Instagram it as #hashtag cuisine, and bridge cultural gaps that used to span oceans in matters of seconds.

So Happy February everyone, and Happy White Girl History month. Except you, Kayla. You can fuck right off. ",0,1765799616.0,writingcirclejerk,0,0.4,False

He was the one that had the thirst for life, I don't, so why did I get to live?

  
I make two cups of coffee each morning to stay functional at the office and strike up conversations with my coworkers, they love me. I been told once when I was on holiday that they were glad I got back because the office had gone a bit too quiet, and I just thought ""really? you miss this piece of shit?"" but obviously I just had to play it out. I've taken the roll of the everyone's buddy. I thought that being liked was gonna change everything and I'm gonna love myself more but instead it just made me more numb, because these people have no fucking idea who I truly am.

I go home a drink alcohol to numb myself and just stare at my walls while music plays. I know I should do something else with my time like going to the gym or something, but I can't do it because I don't see the point. If anything I felt like I avoided the gym for so long because I hated being around people who: 1. are there on the regular and look better than me in every way and thus flares up my own insecurities, and 2. afraid of being annoying newbie and judged for using teh equipment when someone else could've make better use of them. I know it's not a useful line of thinking and I should break out of it, but I can't. I don't know why.

I meet with guys regularly for dates and have no problems getting laid and it still makes me empty. They say that I'm a great guy and they love being with me, yet I can't feel anything.

I can't connect with people anymore and the only one I could connect with, is gone. I wasted all of the time I had with him when we were still allowed to make mistakes and the feeling eats away at me every single day.

I don't feel anything. I know I'm my biggest enemy and all of my misery right now is my fault but it's a spiral I can't get out off. All I want is for someone, or something, to make it all stop.",4,1765799094.0,depression,1,1.0,False

Anyway, the latter task created an argument where my partner said women clean and men provide. I then said he doesn’t provide anything (I own the flat outright and pay for household things that need fixing (and do them myself or with my dad), half the bills and we buy separate food). His teenage son lives with us full time now and he said he provides for his son. 

This has started to make me panic a little. We have had conversations in the past where he’s said he cannot afford to financially support me because of his son (who is 16).

1pn5bpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/MovingtoSoutheastAsia/comments/1pn5bpp/vietnam_the_ultimate_guide_to_banking_for_expats/,"[Vietnam] The Ultimate Guide to Banking for Expats in 2025: The Good, The Bad, and The Bureaucracy","I’m seeing a lot of questions lately about moving to Vietnam and, specifically, how to handle money once you land. After digging through the current regulations and comparing the major players for 2025, I’ve put together a deep dive into banking options for expats.

**The ""TL;DR"" Reality Check:** Vietnam has strict capital controls. Getting money *in* is easy; getting money *out* is difficult without proper documentation (proof of income/tax). Also, the days of opening a bank account on a tourist visa are effectively over. You generally need a Work Permit, TRC (Temporary Residence Card), or at least a 6-month-plus business visa to get a fully functional account.

Here is the breakdown of your best options:

# 1. The International Heavyweights

*Best for: Peace of mind, global linkage, and holding foreign currency.*

**A. HSBC / Standard Chartered** These are the go-to options for expats who value familiarity.

* **Pros:**
   * **English Support:** Staff are fluent, and contracts are bilingual. You won’t need a translator.
   * **Global Transfer:** Easier to link with your home country account (e.g., HSBC Premier allows instant global transfers between your own accounts).
   * **Safety:** Perceived as safer for holding large sums of USD/EUR.
* **Cons:**
   * **The Apps are Ancient:** The mobile apps are often clunky, slow, and lack the ""lifestyle"" features (like paying utility bills easily or QR scanning) that local banks have mastered.
   * **Fees:** Monthly maintenance fees can be high unless you keep a minimum balance (often \~3 million VND or more).
   * **Strict Compliance:** They follow the rulebook to the letter. If your paperwork isn't perfect, they won't open the account.

**B. Shinhan Bank (South Korea)** A sleeper hit among the expat community, especially given the huge Korean presence in Vietnam.

* **Pros:** great middle ground. Better tech than HSBC, but better English service than local banks. Their credit cards also have decent cashback rates for dining.
* **Cons:** Fewer ATMs than local banks (though you can usually use others for a fee).

# 2. The Local ""Big Boys"" & Modern Contenders

*Best for: Daily life, paying rent, QR codes, and low fees.*

**A. Vietcombank (VCB)** The giant. If you have a landlord, they probably have a VCB account.

* **Pros:**
   * **Massive Network:** ATMs and branches are everywhere.
   * **Interoperability:** Transfers to other local banks are instant.
* **Cons:**
   * **Crowded:** Going to a branch is like visiting the DMV. Take a number and wait for an hour.
   * **Bureaucracy:** They are state-owned and very strict. English support varies wildly by branch.

**B. Techcombank (TCB)** Widely considered the best ""modern"" local bank.

* **Pros:**
   * **The App:** It is excellent. Fast, supports QR payments (which you will use for everything from coffee to Grab), and easy to navigate.
   * **Zero Fees:** They pioneered the ""zero fee"" model for domestic transfers.
   * **Visa Signature:** If you qualify, their credit card offers great foreign transaction rates (around 1.1%).
* **Cons:**
   * **Support:** Branch staff might not speak great English. Bring a Vietnamese friend for the initial setup.

**C. TPBank (Tien Phong Bank)**

* **Pros:**
   * **LiveBank Kiosks:** These are VTMs (Video Teller Machines) that let you do almost everything 24/7, including depositing cash or printing a new debit card instantly, without talking to a human teller.
   * **Modern Image:** Very digital-forward.
* **Cons:** Smaller network than Vietcombank.

# 3. The Digital Darling

*Best for: Convenience and UX.*

**Timo (Powered by BVBank)** Timo is a digital bank (no physical branches, but they have ""Hangouts"").

* **Pros:**
   * **UX King:** The app is beautiful and fully English.
   * **Fee-Free:** No withdrawal fees at almost any ATM in Vietnam (NAPAS network).
   * **Easy:** Very popular with the expat community for day-to-day spending.
* **Cons:**
   * **Documentation:** Since they are strictly regulated, if you don't have a valid TRC/Visa with 12 months validity, they might deny you or lock your account suddenly.
   * **No SWIFT Out:** Sending money internationally directly from Timo is often harder/impossible compared to a traditional bank; you usually have to use a service like Wise.

# 📝 The ""Must-Have"" Paperwork Checklist

Don't walk into a branch without these:

1. **Passport** (Original).
2. **Valid Visa / TRC:** Must usually be valid for 6+ months.
3. **Work Permit:** Or proof of visa exemption/business license.
4. **Proof of Address:** Valid rental contract (notarized is best) or a ""Police Residence Book"" registration (*sổ đăng ký tạm trú*).

# 💡 Pro-Tips from Experience

* **Keep your home bank account:** Never go 100% local. Keep your Chase/Barclays/CommBank open for savings.
* **The ""Money Out"" Trap:** You cannot just ""transfer"" money out of Vietnam online (e.g., to send savings home) unless you go to the branch and show proof that you paid taxes on that money.
* **Wise (formerly TransferWise):** You cannot hold VND in a Wise wallet, but you *can* use Wise to send money *to* your Vietnamese bank account. It is usually the cheapest way to fund your start-up costs.

I make an entry in every time I get a cool gift idea. On a separate tab I have listed all gifts I've ever given and I rate em based on the receiver's response. I know this sounds really obsessive but i just love gifts so much cant do anything lol. Anyways, my mothers birthday is in a month so ive already set out on mission perfect gift (haven't finalized yet) but assuming people come here looking for ideas, I'm hoping this helps. Keeping this mom and grandma coded. (will make one for dads too next dw, just keep on a lookout)
Nixplay digital picture frame (10.1"") 9/10 If your mom's the sentimental type. Preload it with old family photos, little videos or a couple of notes. She won't even have to set it up, just plug it in and it starts playing.
• Touchscreen, rotates automatically, and you can upload pics via app/email • You can keep adding stuff remotely, which is a low effort way to keep the gift alive throughout the year • She'll like it enough to just casually ask ""have you sent anything new?"", trust me • Tip: take just candids and upload, moms love that
(Foot Massager (bob and brads good)) (http://dk5cnflyn7mcb.cloudfront.net/?q=GMKAO467) 8.5/10
For moms who work a lot or have got orthopedic issues. No mom is gonna ask for this directly but will love it if gifted. Also lowkey everyone in the family gets to use it then, good investment imo.
• feels like a real massage, like the vibrations go tissue deep, not just the buzz-y kind • Comes with heat settings and a remote • Not that expensive compared to others with similar specs

If you've got an almond mom lol or if she's just green tea obsessed. Honestly you could replace this with whatever she likes in specific (coffee etc), this one just looked cute to me.
• You can customize the front with her name or a little message • Looks super cute on the kitchen counter • It's out of stock sometimes, but worth checking around mother's day or holidays

Many of you encouraged me to report the barista who purposefully put her eye crust boogers into my coffee. So I wanted to update you on what happened. I called corporate and they assured me it would be taken care of and I would receive a call from the regional manager within a few days. It’s been many many weeks and I never received a call from the regional manager or a call back from corporate. 

According to my friend who recently went into the Starbucks where it happened (Connecticut) and this disgusting woman still works there and is most likely still doing this to people. 

Is Starbucks OK with their baristas putting disgusting things into the drinks of their customers? It seems like it. 

🤮 This is why I will never go to another Starbucks as long as I live.

What happened: **I ordered a coffee the barista put the empty cup in front of her. While standing over the cup she used two fingers to remove the eye crust boogers from her eyes. She looked at the crusts on her fingers then looked over her shoulder and then I saw her put the eye crusts into the cup before filling it with coffee. This all happened on camera.**

1pn58dd,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeltoiWellness/comments/1pn58dd/why_nausea_happens_more_often_during_week_12_for/,Why nausea happens more often during Week 1–2 for Northern Ireland patients starting GLP-1s,"If you’re in Northern Ireland and you’ve just started a GLP-1 medication like Wegovy or Mounjaro, the first couple of weeks can feel a bit…off. For many people, nausea shows up early, sometimes mild, sometimes frustrating, sometimes enough to make you wonder if something’s gone wrong.

The short answer is this: early nausea is common, expected, and usually temporary. The longer answer is a bit more interesting.

GLP-1s slow things down on purpose

GLP-1 medications work by slowing gastric emptying. In plain terms, food leaves your stomach more slowly than it used to. This is one of the main ways they help with appetite control and blood sugar stability.

In the first 1–2 weeks, your digestive system hasn’t adapted yet. Your stomach, gut hormones, and brain are all recalibrating at the same time. That mismatch is what often causes nausea early on.

Your body catches up, but it needs time.

Why it can feel worse in NI specifically

A few Northern Ireland-specific factors crop up again and again when patients describe early nausea:

• Meal patterns here tend to be irregular. Skipping breakfast, late dinners, or long gaps between meals can hit harder once gastric emptying slows.  
• Portion sizes are often larger than we realise, especially at the main evening meal. What used to feel normal can suddenly feel too much.  
• Strong tea, coffee, fizzy drinks, and rich foods are staples for a lot of us, and these can be early nausea triggers on GLP-1s.  
• Cold weather can reduce thirst, leading to mild dehydration, which makes nausea worse.

None of this means you’re doing anything wrong. It just means the medication changes how forgiving your body is during the adjustment phase.

Week 1–2 is an adaptation window, not a verdict

One of the biggest worries people have is thinking early nausea means the medication doesn’t suit them. In most cases, that’s not true.

For the majority of patients, nausea peaks in the first 7–14 days and then settles as the gut adapts. This is why dose escalation is slow and gradual. The aim isn’t speed, it’s tolerance.

Clinics that rush dosing tend to see more side effects. Slower, monitored starts usually mean better outcomes long-term. This is something doctor-led services like Keltoi are particularly careful about, especially for NI patients who may already be juggling work, family, and winter fatigue.

Common early nausea triggers to watch for

During the first couple of weeks, nausea is more likely when:

• You eat quickly  
• You eat past fullness  
• Meals are high fat or very rich  
• You drink large volumes with meals  
• You go long periods without eating  
• You’re dehydrated  
• You lie flat too soon after eating

Again, none of these are permanent restrictions. They’re temporary adjustments while your body learns a new rhythm.

What actually helps in the first two weeks

Simple changes tend to work better than dramatic ones:

• Smaller meals, more often if needed  
• Eating slowly and stopping early  
• Protein first, heavy foods later  
• Sipping fluids throughout the day rather than chugging  
• Keeping meals plainer while symptoms settle  
• Staying upright after eating  
• Accepting that appetite cues will feel different at first

Trying to power through nausea or ignore it often backfires. Listening early usually shortens how long it hangs around.

When nausea is not normal

While mild to moderate nausea is expected early on, there are times when it should be checked:

• Persistent vomiting  
• Severe abdominal pain  
• Inability to keep fluids down  
• Symptoms that worsen rather than improve after two weeks

That’s where proper clinical oversight matters. Not everything should be brushed off as “normal side effects”.

The key thing to remember

Week 1–2 on GLP-1s is not about weight loss results. It’s about adaptation.

If nausea shows up early, it doesn’t mean the medication is failing you. It usually means it’s doing exactly what it’s designed to do, and your body is learning how to work with it.

For most NI patients, this phase passes. The goal is not perfection, it’s tolerance, safety, and sustainability.

If you’re starting out or supporting someone who is, patience in the first two weeks pays off later.",1,1765798650.0,KeltoiWellness,0,1.0,False

Growing up my parents were extremely traditional. All three of my brothers had massive weddings that my parents fully paid for. I'm talking $40k+ each. Fancy venues, open bars, hundreds of guests, destination bachelor parties, the whole thing. My parents were very involved in planning and were so proud showing off these big events.

When I got engaged two years ago I assumed I'd get the same treatment. Nope. My parents sat me down and said they weren't comfortable paying for my wedding because my fiancée is a woman. They're not ""okay with the lifestyle"" and won't financially support or attend a same-sex wedding.

So my now-wife and I paid for our own wedding. It was small, just close friends at a park with a backyard reception at a friend's house. Cost us about $5k total which we saved for. It was honestly really nice and intimate but it hurt like hell watching my parents fund extravagant weddings for my brothers while refusing to even show up to mine.

We've barely spoken in two years. Now I'm pregnant (IVF) and suddenly they want back in my life. Want to meet the baby, be grandparents, have a relationship again.

We met for coffee and they said they ""regret if their choices caused pain"" but want to move forward. I asked what specifically they regret. They wouldn't say and just kept talking about fresh starts.

I told them if they're actually sorry they can prove it by giving me the $40k they would've spent on my wedding, just like they did for my brothers. My mom started crying. My dad said I'm being ridiculous and manipulative.

Now my brothers are blowing up my phone saying I'm being petty and immature. That I should just accept the apology and move on.

* ARM - Goldman Downgrades ARM to Sell from neutral, PT 120. We believe ARM’s high royalty revenue exposure to the smartphone market (\~60%), with locked-in royalty rates and low unit growth, limits upside to fundamentals in the near term. We also expect ARM to continue increasing R&D spending to pursue the chip manufacturing opportunity, which will drive less financial leverage in FY27/FY28, even as details on the company's strategy remain scarce and the competitive set is very formidable. Finally, we note that SoftBank retains the vast majority of ownership in ARM shares. Our updated FY27/FY28 EPS estimates are \~6% below the Street consensus.""
* TER: Goldman upgrades TER to Buy from Sell, raises PT to 230 from 148.  ""Although we had been previously cautious on the stock given expectations for a muted Mobile recovery (which has largely materialized), we expect accelerating growth in the company's semiconductor test segment—particularly in GPUs—to more than offset this weakness in 2026. We note that Teradyne posted a strong third quarter with revenue up 18% quarter-over-quarter, mostly driven by AI-related demand uplift on the back of large-scale data center buildouts. We believe sustained strength in VIP compute customers and memory (especially HBM/DRAM), as well as a potential design win with a Merchant GPU tester, is poised to drive further revenue upside in 2026. Although risks remain—such as the lumpiness of data center investments and continued weakness in the mobile and automotive markets—we expect that stronger trends tied to AI infrastructure buildouts will more than offset these risks. Our view is summarized by the following key points:""
* COST: Roth/MKM downgrades Cost to sell from Neutral, Lowers PT to 769 from 906. ""Despite a 1Q earnings beat, underlying metrics are concerning: (1) renewal rates are fading; (2) paid members have slowed, possibly negative quarter-over-quarter (adjusted for openings); and (3) year-over-year comparable traffic is decelerating. 
* DOCS: Morgan Stanley upgrades DOCS to overweight from EqualWEight, raise PT to 65 from 62. Notably, stricter constraints on direct-to-consumer advertising could drive a shift in ad dollars toward healthcare professional platforms like Doximity, representing potential upside to our estimates. A 30% correction since earnings on 11/6 (compared to the Nasdaq +2% during this time) provides an attractive entry point, with the stock trading at more than a 25% discount to its median EV/EBITDA multiple post-Covid.   LVS - Goldman upgrades LVS to Buy from Neutral, PT 80. ""We expect Macau gross gaming revenue to exhibit sustained momentum into 2026, and with Singapore firing on all cylinders, we have gained greater confidence in LVS's ability to sustain EBITDA at Marina Bay Sands in the high $2bn to low $3bn range annually, with potential for continued upwards revisions as LVS continues to take share and drive hold higher. Going forward, we expect LVS to sustain \~$2bn+ of annual share repurchases, even as it invests significant amounts of capital in IR2 ($8bn) while maintaining net leverage in the low- to mid-2s range. Indeed, our excess liquidity analysis implies that LVS could repurchase \~30% of its current market cap (\~$13bn) if it were to flex its balance sheet to \~3x net leverage (which is still comfortably below peers).""
* WAY - UBS initiates with Buy rating, PT 41.  ""Waystar is a leading cloud-native revenue cycle management platform, positioned to capture a multi-year secular shift toward automation, electronic transactions, and AI-enabled workflows across provider organizations. Based on our analysis of WAY’s results and competitive positioning, its acquisition of Iodine, and the accelerating adoption of AI in revenue cycle management, we expect low-double-digit topline and low- to mid-teens EBITDA growth, with our adjusted EBITDA estimates 3–4% ahead of consensus. Our numbers may prove conservative if cross-sell into new customers (won from Change or elsewhere) accelerates, or the company completes more M&A.

I don't think I've lived a tough life. but ever since I was 15, I've been at constant war within myself. I feel a lot. with nothing that triggers it. I just feel. 

I know there are types of people who absorb others emotions. but I'm not that way. I just feel a lot within myself. but it comes in waves. most of the times I struggle to feel. I only cry when I watch or listen to specific movies/songs. I need to get into the mood, only then I would cry.

I think I feel so much but struggle to express them. I can't go through the day with energy or in the best mood without caffeine. I'm only ""myself"" if I've chugged a cup of strong coffee. 

on days I don't, I'm not smiling, not chatty, and not happy. I drink coffee everyday because I need to get work done. I don't like how I am without it.

I'm the type to isolate when I'm low, and don't want to be disturbed. it happens so often that my close friend knows to leave me alone always. there are times where I'd wish someone would check on me when it's bad, but it's confusing with me because I love and hate humans.

I crave for connection. but I can't regulate myself around people. I'm still learning so much about myself and on how I function. I don't think anyone could ever understand how it works up in my head, because I still struggle to as well.

relationships aren't good for me because I start depending on them and expecting that they'd get me. and it's exhausting to keep exlplaing myself. but I crave connection. I can't be a hermit because I'm such a people's person. that's why I said I have a love hate relationship with humans.

this year, I tried understanding myself better and thought I was getting there. but I catch myself on the low again and again and im starting to feel exhausted being me.

Dollar Shave Club's launch ad cost $4,500 to make. Not $45K. Not $450K. Four thousand five hundred dollars.

That ad generated 12,000 orders in the first 48 hours and eventually helped sell the company for $1 billion to Unilever.

Meanwhile, I'm over here watching Shopify store owners spend $15K on a ""professional"" ad that gets 47 likes and 2 sales (one from their mom).

Something wasn't adding up.

**The Part That Actually Made Me Obsessed**

I've analyzed 2,847 ecommerce ads over the past 18 months. 

But Dollar Shave Club's ad kept bothering me because everyone talks about it being ""funny"" and ""viral"" but nobody explains WHY it worked from a conversion standpoint.

So I did what any reasonable person would do: I watched it 127 times. Frame by frame. With a spreadsheet.

Then I found 49 other ""legendary"" ads (Purple Mattress, Squatty Potty, Poo-Pourri, etc.) and did the same thing.

What I found wasn't ""make it funny"" or ""be authentic."" That's surface-level garbage advice.

**The 9 Principles That Actually Matter (And Why Your Ads Are Missing Them)**

**Principle #1: The ""Disqualification Hook"" (0-3 seconds)**

Here's what blew my mind: Dollar Shave Club opens with ""Hi, I'm Mike, and I'm the founder of DollarShaveClub.com.""

Boring, right? WRONG.

In my frame-by-frame analysis, I found that 47 out of 50 viral ecommerce ads use what I call a ""disqualification hook"" in the first 3 seconds. It's not about grabbing attention - it's about FILTERING it.

Mike doesn't say ""Tired of expensive razors?"" or ""Want to save money?"" He literally just states who he is and what he does. The genius part? He's filtering for people who are *actually in the market* for razors.

I tested this against ""attention-grabbing"" hooks in 23 different ad variants for a supplement company. The disqualification hooks had 34% lower CTR but 312% higher purchase rate. Why? Because they filtered out tire-kickers.

**The mistake everyone makes:** They optimize for clicks, not for buyers. Your hook should repel as many people as it attracts.

**Principle #2: The ""Credibility Slip"" (3-7 seconds)**

At the 4-second mark, Mike casually mentions ""our blades are f\*\*\*ing great.""

This isn't just shock value. Watch carefully - he's wearing a polo shirt, standing in a warehouse, looking completely normal... then drops an F-bomb while maintaining eye contact.

I call this the ""credibility slip"" - it's an intentional pattern break that signals ""this person isn't reading a script.""

Here's the data that shocked me: I analyzed 156 ads with profanity vs. without. The profanity ads had 23% worse brand recall but 67% higher ""trust scores"" in follow-up surveys.

Why? Because scripted ads prime you for skepticism. The credibility slip breaks that pattern.

**The mistake everyone makes:** They try to be ""professional"" in the first 10 seconds when they should be establishing ""this is a real human, not a corporate robot.""

I tested this with a DTC furniture brand. Their original ad: ""Welcome to \[Brand\], where we make quality furniture affordable."" Conversion rate: 1.8%.

New version with credibility slip: ""I'm \[Name\], I started this company because IKEA furniture is absolute garbage and I was sick of it."" Conversion rate: 4.3%.

**Principle #3: The ""Value Anchor Reversal"" (8-15 seconds)**

This is where it gets really interesting.

Most ads follow this structure: Problem → Solution → Price Dollar Shave Club does: Solution → Price → Problem

Watch the timing: Mike mentions the $1/month price at the 9-second mark, BEFORE he's even fully explained what you get.

I tracked eye movement data on 89 test subjects watching various ad structures. When price comes before full value explanation, cognitive processing spikes by 340%. Your brain literally can't compute ""$1"" for razors, so it stays engaged to resolve the confusion.

But here's the trap I fell into: I tried this with a $197 course. It failed spectacularly. Conversion rate dropped 62%.

After testing 47 different price points across 12 industries, I found the pattern: This only works when the price is SO LOW that it creates genuine disbelief.

**The threshold:** If your price is more than 15% of what people expect to pay, this principle backfires. You need to be at 10% or less of expected price for the value anchor reversal to work.

**Principle #4: The ""Absurdity Escalation Curve"" (15-30 seconds)**

Here's where everyone gets it wrong.

They watch DSC and think ""okay, I need to be random and funny."" So they add a bear riding a unicycle or whatever.

But track the absurdity level frame-by-frame, and you'll see it follows a perfect mathematical curve.

At 15 seconds: Mild absurdity (guy in bear suit) At 20 seconds: Medium absurdity (machete cutting through products) At 25 seconds: High absurdity (baby shaving Mike's head)

I mapped this escalation pattern across all 50 viral ads. 44 of them follow the same curve - absurdity increases by roughly 30% every 5 seconds, but never doubles in one jump.

Why does this matter? I tested ""random absurdity"" vs. ""escalating absurdity"" across 34 ad variations.

Random absurdity: 12% completion rate Escalating absurdity: 47% completion rate

Your brain needs the absurdity to build gradually. Jump too fast and people think ""this is trying too hard."" Go too slow and they get bored.

**The formula I extracted:** Start at 20% absurd (slightly unusual but believable), increase by 25-35% every 5 seconds, cap at 80% absurd (still loosely connected to your product).

**Principle #5: The ""Benefit Burial"" (30-45 seconds)**

This one broke my brain.

In the entire Dollar Shave Club ad, Mike mentions actual razor benefits for maybe 8 seconds total. The rest is entertainment.

But here's what I discovered analyzing 2,100+ ad comments: People don't remember the benefits. They remember the FEELINGS associated with the benefits.

I did a brutal test: I created two ads for a coffee brand.

Ad A: 45 seconds of benefit-focused content (taste, quality, sourcing) Ad B: 15 seconds of benefits, 30 seconds of absurd entertainment

Then I surveyed viewers 24 hours later: ""What do you remember about the product?""

Ad A: 12% could recall any specific benefit Ad B: 8% could recall any specific benefit

But here's the twist: Ad B had 3.2x higher purchase intent.

Why? Because humans buy on emotion, then justify with logic. If you lead with logic, you're fighting uphill. If you lead with emotion, the brain SEARCHES for logical justification.

**The mistake everyone makes:** They think more benefit communication = more sales. Actually, benefit overload triggers analysis paralysis.

The optimal ratio I found across 89 tested ads: 30% benefits, 70% entertainment/emotion. Any more benefits and you're just creating objections your brain needs to process.

**Principle #6: The ""Objection Pre-Handle"" (45-60 seconds)**

At the 48-second mark, Mike says: ""And the best part is, the prices are so low, I don't even need a freaking business degree to understand them.""

This isn't a joke. It's a pre-handle for the objection: ""This seems too cheap to be good quality.""

I found this pattern in 41 out of 50 viral ads: They address the BIGGEST objection in a way that seems like entertainment, not defense.

Here's the framework I reverse-engineered:

1. Identify your prospect's #1 objection (not what YOU think it is, what your customer surveys say it is)
2. Embed the answer in a moment of apparent absurdity
3. Never directly acknowledge you're handling an objection

I tested this with a skincare brand. Their main objection: ""Natural products don't work as well as chemical ones.""

Original ad: Spent 15 seconds explaining their clinical studies New ad: Had the founder dramatically throw a chemical product in the trash while saying ""Yeah, we could put a bunch of unpronounceable garbage in here, but we're not sociopaths""

The second ad didn't provide MORE evidence, but conversion rate went from 2.1% to 5.8%.

**Why this works:** Your brain doesn't want to be SOLD to. But it's perfectly happy to have its concerns casually dismissed in a way that makes you laugh.

**Principle #7: The ""Commitment Micro-Step"" (60-75 seconds)**

Watch what happens at 1:04: Mike says ""Stop forgetting to buy your blades every month.""

This is a micro-commitment trigger disguised as benefit language.

Here's what I found analyzing 1,847 completed purchases: The average customer makes 7-11 micro-commitments in their head before buying. But if you ASK for the macro-commitment (clicking ""buy now"") too early, conversion rate tanks.

I tracked scroll depth, time on page, and micro-interactions for 340,000 site visitors across 23 stores. The visitors who converted had 8.7 micro-commitments on average. The ones who bounced? 2.1.

**The micro-commitments that matter:**

* Nodding along to a problem statement
* Imagining using the product
* Mentally calculating value
* Dismissing an objection
* Comparing to current solution
* Visualizing the outcome
* Acknowledging the price is fair

DSC gets 6 of these 7 in 75 seconds. Most ads get maybe 2.

**The mistake everyone makes:** They front-load benefits, then just expect people to buy. You need to build a micro-commitment ladder where each step feels effortless.



**Principle #8: The ""Risk Reversal Pivot"" (75-85 seconds)**

At 1:18, Mike pivots: ""Do you like spending $20 a month on brand name razors? 19 go to Roger Federer!""

This is NOT about price comparison. It's about externalizing risk.

I tested this across 67 different ads. When you frame the competition as the ""risky"" choice instead of defending YOUR choice, conversion rates increase by an average of 47%.

Here's why: Your brain is loss-averse. It's not motivated by gains as much as it's motivated by avoiding losses.

""Buy my product and save money"" = weak motivator ""Keep buying their product and keep losing money"" = strong motivator

I ran this test with a meal kit company:

Version A: ""Save $40/week on groceries"" Version B: ""Stop throwing away $2,000/year on groceries you never eat""

Version B had 2.3x higher conversion even though it's the SAME VALUE PROPOSITION.

**The formula:** Don't position your product as the gain. Position the status quo as the loss. Then your product becomes the ""safe"" choice, not the ""risky"" new thing.



**Principle #9: The ""Social Proof Breadcrumb"" (85-90 seconds)**

At the very end, Mike says ""dollarshaveclub.com"" while the entire warehouse full of people are staring at the camera.

This isn't a production flourish. It's deliberate social proof.

Here's what most people miss: The ad never CLAIMS to be popular. It just SHOWS a bunch of people who apparently work there, implying scale.

I tested explicit social proof (""Join 50,000+ customers"") vs. implicit social proof (showing multiple people using/making the product) across 156 ads.

Explicit social proof: +23% conversion Implicit social proof: +61% conversion

Why the huge difference? Because your brain trusts what it observes more than what it's told.

**The mistake everyone makes:** They put testimonial quotes or customer counts on screen. That triggers skepticism (""Is that real? Did they pay those people?"").

Instead, show evidence of scale or social acceptance WITHOUT claiming it. Let the viewer's brain make the connection.



**The Part Where I Almost Gave Up (And Then Didn't)**

Here's the thing that drove me insane for weeks:

I had all nine principles documented. I had tested them individually. But when I tried to replicate the full formula, ads would fail 7 out of 10 times.

Then I discovered the missing piece: **Sequencing tolerances.**

These nine principles have to fire in THIS order, within specific time windows. If Principle #3 (Value Anchor Reversal) happens before Principle #2 (Credibility Slip), the whole thing collapses.

I built a 23-page timing matrix showing the acceptable time ranges for each principle. Too early and you lose people. Too late and the momentum dies.

For example:

* Principle #2 must fire between 3-8 seconds (not 2, not 9)
* Principle #5 needs at least 25 seconds of runtime before it activates
* Principle #8 ONLY works if Principle #6 happened at least 10 seconds earlier

**What I Built After Losing My Mind Over This**

After spending 340 hours on this rabbit hole, I created a frame-by-frame breakdown library of 50+ legendary ecommerce ads.

Not just Dollar Shave Club. Purple Mattress. Squatty Potty. Poo-Pourri. Liquid Death. Ridge Wallet. All of them.

Each breakdown includes:

* Exact timestamp when each principle fires
* The specific language patterns used
* Production cost estimates for each segment
* Why cheaper alternatives work just as well
* Frame-by-frame analysis of what's happening psychologically
* The micro-commitments being triggered
* Objection pre-handles disguised as entertainment
* Acceptable timing windows for each principle

Plus a pattern database showing which combinations work for different product types (physical products vs. subscriptions vs. high-ticket vs. consumables).

Because here's what I learned: You can't just copy Dollar Shave Club. A razor subscription and a $2,000 mattress require different principle combinations.

The library shows you exactly which patterns work for YOUR product type, with production budget alternatives at $1K, $5K, and $10K levels.

**The Part Where I Tell You What To Do**

If you want access to the Viral Ad Deconstruction Library (all 50+ ads broken down frame-by-frame, plus the replicable pattern database), drop a comment below and I'll send you the link.

Fair warning: It's not a quick read. The Dollar Shave Club breakdown alone is 47 pages. But if you're spending real money on ads that aren't working, this will save you months of expensive testing.

Also, if you've tried to replicate DSC's approach and failed, tell me what happened in the comments. I've probably documented why it didn't work (usually it's Principle #3 or #7 firing at the wrong time).",1,1765798130.0,FacebookAds,1,0.67,False
1pn50vo,https://i.redd.it/3bo3hjvhrc7g1.jpeg,Maison Alhambra Kismet for men : A sophisticated affordable alternative to YSL Tuxedo for gentlemen,"Maison Alhambra's Kismet for Men was one of the most discussed fragrances among YouTube reviewers until 2023. At the moment, none of the reviewers talk about it. Either because there are lots of fragrances or they are not “incentivized” any more. It is inspired fragrance or clone of Yves Saint Laurent's Tuxedo and, Rochas Moustache EDP or By Kilian Straight to Heaven Extreme. There is a slightly more expensive clone as well, Afnan Turathi Brown.

**Classification**

Woody, Spicy, & Oriental. I find this DNA earthy.

**When I Bought Kismet for men**

Possibly, 2022 or 2023, I don’t remember

**The Scent**

It is a classy and mature men’s fragrance

**Notes**

|**Top Notes**|Woody Notes, Nutmeg|
|:-|:-|
||
|||
|**Middle Notes**|Patchouli, Sandalwood, Cacao, Coffee|
|**Base Notes**|Vanilla, Vetiver|

**Notes -what I can smell**

It is hard for me to pinpoint specific notes. Primarily, I can smell spicy notes and patchouli. It has woody and earthy feel. I cannot smell some of the notes distinctly like vanilla, cacao or coffee.

Is it for everyone?

In my opinion, this fragrance is not a mass pleasing DNA. It is a mature men’s fragrance and you need certain kind of persona to pull it off. A classy and sophisticated male who has finer taste in life.

**Performance, Longevity & Sillage**

**Longevity:** 4-7 hours depending on weather. In summers, it doesn’t last long. In winters it shines. On clothes, it lasts up to 24-30 hours. Overall, it is an average performer, in line with most designer fragrances.

**Sillage & Projection:** It is average. However, it shines in winters with above average projection especially in night. During December nights in cold weather I love how it smells in the air.

**Wearability and Best Occasions:**

It is best suited for formal occasions in cold weather. Most suitable for winter day;  special occasions events like weddings etc.

It can also be used in office with max 1 or 2 sprays but I feel it is for someone who is a senior role person.

**Signature Scent Worthy?**

Yes. It's you won't find many wearing this DNA.

**Downside**

Personally, I don’t think this has any downside except for the cases where people prefer “beast” mode fragrance. The performance for Kismet for men is average.

**Final Thoughts & Alternatives**

It delivers a rich, complex, and classy scent profile with woody, spicy notes. It can be described as ""manly,"" ""unique,"" and ""sophistication in a bottle."" But I don’t think this is mass pleasing DNA and may not suit some personas. I have not tried Yves Saint Laurent's Tuxedo so I cannot compare it with the original inspiration. I have tried Rochas Moustache EDP and I have purchased this from the US and should be getting it soon for a better comparison. It smells very close to Moustache. I have tried Afnan Turathi Brown which is a denser clone. I find Kismet for me to be more airy and better suited for most occasions and it is cheaper. I feel there are very few occasions where one can use Afnan Turathi Brown.

**Overall, I feel Kismet for men to be a great value for money if you like Yves Saint Laurent's Tuxedo DNA.**",4,1765797913.0,ScentHeads,0,1.0,False

- adjusted grinder to setting 1 (fine) 
- set front dial to be max

At the moment, none of the reviewers talk about it. Either because there are lots of fragrances or they are not “incentivized” any more. It is inspired fragrance or clone of Yves Saint Laurent's Tuxedo and, Rochas Moustache EDP or By Kilian Straight to Heaven Extreme. There is a slightly more expensive clone as well, Afnan Turathi Brown.

**Classification**

Woody, Spicy, & Oriental. I find this DNA earthy.

**When I Bought Kismet for men**

Possibly, 2022 or 2023, I don’t remember

**The Scent**

It is a classy and mature men’s fragrance

**Notes**

|**Top Notes**|Woody Notes, Nutmeg|
|:-|:-|
||
|||
|**Middle Notes**|Patchouli, Sandalwood, Cacao, Coffee|
|**Base Notes**|Vanilla, Vetiver|

**Notes -what I can smell**

It is hard for me to pinpoint specific notes. Primarily, I can smell spicy notes and patchouli. It has woody and earthy feel. I cannot smell some of the notes distinctly like vanilla, cacao or coffee.

Is it for everyone?

In my opinion, this fragrance is not a mass pleasing DNA. It is a mature men’s fragrance and you need certain kind of persona to pull it off. A classy and sophisticated male who has finer taste in life.

**Performance, Longevity & Sillage**

**Longevity:** 4-7 hours depending on weather. In summers, it doesn’t last long. In winters it shines. On clothes, it lasts up to 24-30 hours. Overall, it is an average performer, in line with most designer fragrances.

**Sillage & Projection:** It is average. However, it shines in winters with above average projection especially in night. During December nights in cold weather I love how it smells in the air.

**Wearability and Best Occasions:**

It is best suited for formal occasions in cold weather. Most suitable for winter day;  special occasions events like weddings etc.

It can also be used in office with max 1 or 2 sprays but I feel it is for someone who is a senior role person.

**Signature Scent Worthy?**

Yes. It's you won't find many wearing this DNA.

**Downside**

Personally, I don’t think this has any downside except for the cases where people prefer “beast” mode fragrance. The performance for Kismet for men is average.

**Final Thoughts & Alternatives**

It delivers a rich, complex, and classy scent profile with woody, spicy notes. It can be described as ""manly,"" ""unique,"" and ""sophistication in a bottle."" But I don’t think this is mass pleasing DNA and may not suit some personas. I have not tried Yves Saint Laurent's Tuxedo so I cannot compare it with the original inspiration. I have tried Rochas Moustache EDP and I have purchased this from the US and should be getting it soon for a better comparison. It smells very close to Moustache. I have tried Afnan Turathi Brown which is a denser clone. I find Kismet for me to be more airy and better suited for most occasions and it is cheaper. I feel there are very few occasions where one can use Afnan Turathi Brown.

**Overall, I feel Kismet for men to be a great value for money if you like Yves Saint Laurent's Tuxedo DNA.**",1,1765797757.0,Perfumehouse,0,1.0,False

He grew up with outdoor cats and apparently thinks it's fine to hit them when they misbehave.

Yesterday my kitten (5 months old, tiny) knocked over a glass of water on the coffee table. Jake literally smacked him hard enough that my cat yowled and ran under the couch shaking.

I lost it. Told him if he ever touches my cat again I'm calling the cops and filing charges. That I have cameras in the living room (I do) and I'll press charges for animal abuse.

He got pissed and said I'm overreacting, it was just a tap to teach him. I said hitting a 5 month old kitten isn't teaching him shit, it's abuse.

My roommate is mad at me saying I'm being dramatic and threatening her boyfriend over nothing. That cats are fine and mine is being a baby. She wants me to apologize to him.

I told her he's not allowed back here until he apologizes to ME and promises to never touch my cat again.

Now she's saying I'm controlling and making her choose between me and her boyfriend. That I'm being unreasonable.

Mulligan and his team made headlines around the entire state and even inspired many other successful tycoons around the country to do the same thing he was doing. Because of his stature in Texas, his funding was of no question, all he had to do was deal with the city and state governing bodies; which proved to be suspiciously easy. Things were moving fast, and Lance had an almost concerning amount of passion about getting this project up and running. During the construction in the fall and winter months, a few select number of families were chosen and invited to be the first residents of Mulligan’s Valley. After a swift summer grand opening, and all the big news had died down, things in the Valley were running smoothly. People settled into their new designer homes so quickly that you’d think that they’d lived there for their entire lives. From an outside perspective, it truly looked like a piece of paradise.

30 Years Later

By the spring of 2010, Mulligan’s Valley had become just that, a Valley. Though the town still held (most) of its structural integrity, it had become void of any sense of utopia, much less paradise. In 1986, Lance Mulligan was disgraced and on the verge of bankruptcy. The very next year, he was charged with five counts of embezzlement and tax fraud. When the authorities received an arrest warrant for him; Mulligan and his wife Lila, suddenly disappeared. That night when the police searched the town to see where they could have gone, all they found was their abandoned car, with both doors swung open to the hinges, sitting at the edge of Craven’s Quarry. The town moved on pretty quickly from their deaths,  but the quarry never opened back up to the public; and for thirty years there’s been a security guard on site around the spot where their car was found ever since.

Mulligan‘s dream had turned into any other overlooked small town in Texas. Over the years, those select number of families turned into anyone who was willing to move there, and The Valley fell into the ownership of the first wealthy person that offered to buy it. Some of the people willing to live there happened to be 16-year-old Charlie Jones and his family.

Charlie was your average teenager, who had normal hobbies, like photography and biking the town trails with his close group of friends. He kept solid b’s and c’s in school, which would be more than enough for him to get into a good state university when he applies next year. Charlie lived with his mother, Rose, who worked as vice principal at his high school, Halloran High, which was the only high school in town. His older sister, Veronica, a recent early graduate from Rice University, has just moved in back home before spring break. Charlie loved his small family and his small life in his small town.

The Phone At The Bottom Of Craven’s Quarry

BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BE-

Veronica, hungover and annoyed, bursts into Charlie’s room and loudly slams on his alarm clock to turn off the blaring sounds. “How can you possibly sleep through that?” She says, while holding her forehead in her hand. Charlie, barely conscious, moans his witty remark, “I can’t, but usually there isn’t a strange unemployed woman in my room who wakes me up”.  “I set that for 8:15, it’s spring break, why do this to me?” Charlie says, as he yawns and sits up on his bed. “Blame Mom, she wanted to make sure you didn’t skip today.” Veronica walks out of the room and starts making herself a pot of coffee. Even though his mother, Rose had authority on campus and even more at his home, Charlie and his friends had a proclivity for skipping school on days where they thought would be spent better elsewhere.

Today was no different.

After waking up, Charlie starts his normal morning routine of hygiene and sitting on his bed while staring at his open closet trying pick his outfit for the day. In the middle of him changing, he hears a tap on his bedroom window; but when he went to check, there was nothing there. Charlie sat back down on his bed to tie his shoes and once again, a tap on his window. He cautiously opened his curtains another time and looked all around outside and just as he was starting to feel uneasy, Charlie’s best friend, Shaun Willmore, popped up from the ground. “WATCHU DOIN’ IN THERE?” Shaun screams at the window in an elderly accent. Charlie gives a sarcastic “ha ha” before opening the window to let Shaun in.

“You almost ready?” Shaun says while crawling through the windowsill. “Tracy and Noah are already on the way to the quarry to get set up.” “Yeah, give me one sec”, Charlie replies while finishing the final loops of his shoelaces. After sneaking into the kitchen and avoiding his sister to grab water bottles for their trip, the two friends grab their bags full of supplies ready for the day, and head out back through the window to start another adventure.

After a 45-minute sunny and breeze filled bike ride to the edge of town, Charlie and Shaun arrive at a stretch of an unkept, pine oak - filled forest that covered the rest of the way to Craven’s Quarry. The boys attempted to ride through the overgrown and out-rooted woods, but after one minute of bumping their years old bmx bikes on root knubs and and rocks, they decided to walk the rest of the way. When they arrived at border of the forest, A voice from the trees shouts “LEROY JENKINS!” As an arsenal of water balloons begins to get launched at Shaun and Charlie.

“Alright guys, you got water in my eardrum. Mission accomplished”, Shaun yells at the trees, as Tracy and Noah begin to climb down from their hiding spots with their buckets. “It was all Noah’s idea” Tracy says, with the biggest smile on her face that was so infectious it almost forced you to smile. “Hey! Throw me right under the bus, why don’t you?” Noah exclaims while laughing. “Sorry though boys, I walked outside this morning, and it just felt too good not to do to sumbody. You can point the blame at Tracy for that aerial guerilla attack; she’s the gymnast here. I’m pretty sure I pulled something on the way up and on the way down.”  The four friends, all together, start walking to the quarry cove, where the opening acted as the shore of a beach where people could sit and swim. After laying out all their blankets and putting their stuff down in their spots, they all sat down and sparked a joint. On this hot Friday morning, aside from a scattered call by a nearby bird, or a rare jump out of water from an energized bass, Craven’s Quarry was dead silent. “So what do you guys wanna do first?” Tracy says to the group, while looking in her bag for water. Charlie, stoned and looking up at the clouds, dozed off back asleep like he had never gotten out of his bed.

About an hour had passed and while Charlie is just waking up, the rest of the group placed their bikes on the ground, having returned from a journey into the unexplored trails. Shaun, Tracy, and Noah only sat down for a minute to drink some water and catch their breaths; then right back up they got, ready to take a swim in the Quarry.

“You coming, Sleeping Snookie? Or are you still working on your tan” Noah shouts as the three of them are waiting for Charlie to join them. Charlie begrudgingly takes off his shirt and his shoes and goes to join his friends in a cool dip in the water. Following four games of chicken, two lap races, and one game of ‘who can hold their breath the longest’, the group waded in the water together, enjoying their time in Texas sun. “Can it possibly get better than this?” Shaun says with a cheesed grin. “I would hope so. We still have a whole week ahead.”

The whole group laughed and smiled with each other. Then suddenly, a pale look appeared on all of their faces instantly. The distant and muffled vibration of a cell phone call started alarming underneath them. There was at least 10 feet of water between the bottom of their heels and the floor of the quarry where the sound was coming from.

MMMMMMMRRRRR - MMMMMMMMRRRR - MMMMMMMMRRRR

The thought of a working cellphone at the bottom of 15 feet of water was nightmare fuel enough for the group of friends to ride away from Craven’s Quarry and never return, but in that moment, a peculiar thought ran through Shaun’s head. “You already know what we have to do guys”

“Absolutely not”, Tracy says, with the same frightened look on her face. “We need to get out of here now.”

Ever since the disappearance of the Mulligan‘s, the residents of the valley knew that there was something off about Craven’s Quarry and that there was found no harm in staying far away from it. All of the friend groups’s parents had previously warned them about going near the quarry as well,  but  a town wide myth and mystery is every curious teenagers Achilles’ heel.

“I don’t think this is such a good idea”, Charlie exclaims as Shaun arrives back to the group holding a snorkel from his bag. “It’ll only be two minutes, then we can leave, I just need to see what I can find.” Shaun turns fully into the water and dives down to the floor. Two minutes and a dozen air bubbles go by and Shaun hasn’t come up to the surface. The three remaining friends start to go as deep as they can to the floor, but none of them were as good of swimmers as Shaun is. After minutes and minutes of trying to dive down, they become tired and even more afraid. “Oh my god” Tracy mumbles, trying to stop herself from crying. “We have to go get sumbody”, Noah says while splashing around frantically. “No one’ll get here in time, we have to save him ourselves” Charlie exclaims, trying to keep on a brave face. Just as the trio catch their breath and prepared to go back under once more, small bubbles began to raise up to the surface. Then, a pop and a splash from the water, leaving only a small, floating, algae covered, black object. “What the hell?”, they all say, almost in unison. Just as Noah was about to grab the device, the phone began to ring once more.

MMMMMMRRR-

Noah picked up the old flip phone before it could ring another time. “H-Hello” he said cautiously. After several unanswered seconds, Noah says in a disturbed tone “it just sounds like…water.” Immediately after finishing his sentence, Noah is dragged and taken under the water before he could even let out another breath. “What the fuck? NOAH!”, Tracy screams, as the silhouette of her best friend was submerged completely.

“C’mon Tracy, we need to get back to the shore now!” Charlie and Tracy start swimming frantically back to the shore, where all their stuff and their bikes laid. The noise of their gasps and anxious kicks in the water being the only sound in the area, echoed throughout the quarry. Before he could turn around to check and see if she was still close behind him, the sounds of Tracy‘s breaststrokes and heavy breathing suddenly went silent.

Charlie was all alone. Part of him was convinced that he was dreaming all of this; he could still be in bed waiting for his alarm to go off for a great last day of school or maybe he’s sleeping off his high on the lake shore and everything that has happened is just some THC induced fantasy.  Maybe none of this was real. That’s what Charlie hoped for.  Realizing that he could nearly touch the ground with his feet and that he was close to the shore, Charlie began to go full swim and then sprint the rest of the way. Charlie, finally back on land, made his way to his things where he could grab his cellphone out of his shoes.

Tripping on the rocks with his wet feet, Charlie crawled to his cellphone and began to go to his contacts to call his mom from school. Just as he arrived at her name, he looked up to see the faint current of the water washing away but leaving that same dirty phone on a pile of rocks. Charlie crawled over to it and began to investigate the device. Wiping the algae and grime off the exterior shell of the phone revealed a retro Motorola logo and an engraved L.M. on it. Charlie instantly knew who those initials stood for, everyone who ever lived in the valley did. Lance Mulligan and his wife were the reason why this spot was such a desired and feared place to adventure in. Right when Charlie begins to wrap his mind around everything and make the call to his mom, The phone that had caused all of these problems, rang once more.

MMMMMMMRRRRR - MMMMMMMRRRRR - MMMMMMMRRRRR- MMMMMMMRRRR-

Charlie was deathly afraid, but also oddly curious and suspecting of what would happen if he answered the phone call.

“HELLO?” Charlie yelled, trying to convince himself that he had any shred of confidence. “WHO THE HELL IS THIS?” Suddenly- A break in the static and a familiar breathing pattern came onto the line.  It was heavy, it was desperate and scared, it was — Shaun.

“Charlie…I’m sorry. We shouldn’t have come here, man”. All of a sudden, two giant chains made of water shot out of the lake and wrapped themselves tightly around Charlie’s ankles. “W-what!” As Charlie begins being pulled back to the depths of Cravens Quarry, he hears the tire squeals of a car from up above.

Jerry Forchheimer, the security of the quarry for the past five years, arrived late to his overlook post that morning.

“HELP!” exclaimed Charlie, as he was being dragged further and further down to where his friends had just met their fate. Fighting and scratching till his last breath, Charlie lets one last “HE-“ before being fully submerged in Craven’s Quarry. Only the soft ripples of the water remained as the four friends were taken away, never to be seen again.

Jerry gets out of his car too late. He begins his mundane patrol when he spots the groups bikes and supplies laying on the shore all nearby together. Zooming in closer with his binoculars, he gathers a detailed report of all of the items, and then begins to survey the water of the quarry.

He takes out his radio and makes a call.

1pn4qo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1pn4qo0/weird_anxiety/,Weird anxiety,"Hello guys, it been a hell of a year for me. Holidays, events , quit smoking ,business related stuff , lost a loved one and also long hours at work (also a lot of food). Recently in the past couple of days (like 5 or 6 I don't remember) I have a hard time doing stuff outside. Like I don't care if I am in a place where it has a bathroom but when ever I need to go to work and I haven't ate well or know that I cant got to the bathroom at all times if feel anxious (stupid I know) . I don't know how to explain it. I don't go to the bathroom like crazy like maximum 1 or 2 times a day and I was and still I'm a really productive person. I didn't get anxious by shit (haha joke) but by the time I quit smoking my stomach took a turn on me. I was a daily smoker for around 4 or 5 years and when I mean smoker I mean I smoked 10 cigarettes easily per day and if it was a long day I could go for 20 or more without any problems other than coughing sometimes. But now when I go to work and think that I can't go to the bathroom from this time to this (1 hour maybe) it kills me. I was always an evening person and I hated mornings and thankfully this year gave me the opportunity to not work in the mornings at all sometimes. But I was always woke up at 11 or 12 am and working from 2 or 3 pm till 9 or maybe 10 pm and then hoping on call to play some games or going for walk or just having fun with my buddies. My GL told me it was from sudden stress and i needed to relax and chill (easier said than done when you run a business) and I said ok and didn't thought about it till one day i woke up in 5 am from my terrible 3 hour sleep didnt ate good at the morning and I was anxious at work and didn't ate also good till 3 pm and then I went to go to eat and suddenly felt super dizzy, I wanted to vomit and almost felt down and I just puked at the floor (I also felt weird cramps and bloating before but i didnt gave any more thinking about it).Needless to say I thought I was fucked. Told my Gl and she said that my fatigue and lack of eating plus the stress and the lost of loved one + the nicotine that my body was used to get took a turn on me (PLUS THAT I DIDNT TOOK MY MEDS also the day before). So I was there drank a cup of lemon juice , took my medication and then went to bed. Woke up and felt good , ate and everything was fine again. My question is, how do you guys comprehend those situations?  Is it was just ""a bad day"" or something else happened that I could not see just now or maybe I don't have crohn and have something like colitis or UC cause I saw some posts and articles that are saying that if quit smoking your disease be affected and get worse with that action in the short term but in the long run is the best thing to do.


Also I am writing this down ,cause I know someone would ask, I am in my early 20s, I exercise weekly (not hard like sweating my ass of but I do) , I don't hang out like i used too cause I didn't got the time to , i smoked rolled up cigarettes (with idk how much nicotine but I was told they where heavy af), quited for about 2 weeks now and also I drink coffee religiously ( 1 cup when I woke in order to function right or if I don't drink one I would just be a zombie)

Thanks for reading my dudes and girls, hope you would have a great Christmas 🎄 ",0,1765796850.0,CrohnsDisease,1,0.5,False
1pn4q2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1pn4q2w/dark_fissures_on_molars_dentist_recommended_4/,"Dark fissures on molars – dentist recommended 4 composite fillings, no X-rays taken","Hi,

I’m currently in Vietnam and went for a routine cleaning and consultation. The dentist used an intraoral camera and recommended four composite fillings on molars/premolars based on what they described as early decay. No bitewing X-rays were taken.

I have no tooth pain, no lingering sensitivity to hot or cold, and I’ve never had fillings before.

Lifestyle:

* Smoking: No
* Alcohol: Occasional
* Coffee: Daily
* Medical conditions: None
* Medications: None

The attached images are photos of the intraoral camera screen shown during the exam.

I understand this can’t be diagnosed definitively without X-rays, but **based on appearance alone**, do these look more consistent with **stained fissures / early enamel changes** that might typically be monitored or sealed, or lesions that would usually justify drilling and composite fillings?

Thanks in advance — I’m mainly trying to understand whether immediate fillings are standard in cases like this or whether it would be reasonable to wait for X-rays or a second opinion in a few months time.

Chapter 2 – Name

When I woke up in the morning, my first thought was— I don't want to go to work.

My second thought was— I don't have the money not to go to work.

The alarm was screaming on my bedside table. I grabbed my phone, shut it off, and stared at the screen for a few seconds.

In the notifications sat a screenshot from the manager: this week's shift schedule. My name was nailed there under tonight's slot:

22:00–06:00.

I stared at those numbers and the image of the convenience store rose in my mind by itself—

The AC, the fluorescent lights, the microwave, the fridge, the smell of cleaning fluid… and those two men who absolutely did not belong in that scene.

One of them only dared say three sentences to me a day, but had stood up like a shield in front of that strange long-haired man. The other one walked in and dragged the temperature of the air down with him, speaking like he was delivering a sentence.

— ""Don't come here tomorrow night.""

Silent Man's words still rang in my ears.

I turned over, buried my face in the pillow, and exhaled into the cotton.

""…I really want to call in sick.""

But to call in sick you need a reason, and on top of the reason you need courage. I had neither.

All I had were rent, utilities, internet, student loans, and bills that were obviously beyond me.

I opened the chat with my coworkers, wanting to ask if anyone would swap shifts. I typed ""Tonight's shift—"" and deleted it.

If I said, ""Two weird guys said they're going to duel here tonight and I'm scared of getting caught up in it,"" a normal person would probably just reply with a question mark.

In the end, I didn't send anything.

\*\*

At nine-thirty that night, I went out with my little shoulder bag like usual.

The convenience store sign glowed in the distance like a save point that never shuts down. Every step I took toward it felt very clear, so clear it was almost funny.

Apparently, only people who are really broke will still clock in on time even after hearing that ""weird things might happen"" in there.

After I punched in and changed into my uniform, the manager was in the back counting stock. He glanced at me. ""That drunk old guy who lay outside the door for half an hour last night—he didn't come back to bother you today, did he?""

""...Huh?"" I froze for a second before realizing he had no idea what actually happened last night.

""No.""

""Good."" The manager didn't even look up. ""There've been more weirdos on night shift lately. Keep an eye out. If something happens, call me—though I probably couldn't win in a fight anyway.""

I snorted, and my mood loosened a little.

If even the manager didn't know about what happened yesterday, that meant—

Either the security footage glitched, or those two did something to it.

Thinking that far only made me less willing to ask.

At ten, I stepped up to the register and went through the usual motions:

Scan, quote the price, make change, say ""Thank you, come again.""

Time trickled past. The sounds in the store slowly condensed into a single layer—

The ""ding"" of the microwave, the hum of the fridge, the chime of the door sensor.

After they repeat long enough, they start to feel like a lullaby.

Until that familiar chime rings.

I look up.

It's him.

Silent Man.

Tonight he's a bit earlier than usual—only ten-thirty. It's just rained outside; fine droplets cling to his shoulders, and there's a faint wet sound when his soles touch the floor.

He looks at me as soon as he walks in.

Not that sneaky, pretending-to-scan-the-shelves kind of glance, but a direct one, like he's checking whether I'm still alive.

His gaze makes me a bit self-conscious. ""…Good evening.""

His Adam's apple moves, like those three words snagged his heartbeat as well.

""You came anyway,"" he says quietly.

""What else would I do?"" I shrug. ""If I don't show up, who's going to ring you up?""

I meant it as a joke, but he doesn't laugh. His eyes only tighten.

""You could… call in,"" he says slowly, each word bitten off. ""Go to a friend's place. Go anywhere. As long as it's far from here.""

""I don't have that many friends,"" I answer bluntly. ""And the manager will kill me.""

He falls silent for a moment, fingers clenching around something in his jacket pocket.

""Better your manager stays alive and you don't,"" he murmurs, ""than the other way around.""

I look at him, feeling like I want to laugh, but can't.

""Can you be a bit clearer?"" I finally can't hold it in. ""That long-haired guy from yesterday—who is he? What duel game are you two playing? And what's with this 'ownership' crap? That sounds super illegal.""

He presses his lips together.

For a moment, a very dark color flashes in his eyes— like something pressed under a seal pushing up from the bottom.

""The less you know, the better,"" he says at last.

""Please. Any excuse will do—fake a stomachache if you have to. Just leave.""

""I'm not a middle schooler asking to go home early because my tummy hurts,"" I sigh. ""Besides, if I leave, what about you?""

He blinks, says nothing.

I look at his profile.

His features are clean. The lines aren't rough, but there's a hardness there you can't ignore. Not the kind you get from the gym—more like something your bones grind out for themselves after being under pressure for too long.

""I think you're scared of him,"" I blurt out.

He drops his gaze and goes quiet for two seconds.

""…What I'm scared of,"" he says softly, ""is that once you meet him, you'll turn into someone even *you* don't recognize.""

I don't get the chance to ask more. He flinches like he's afraid he's already said too much, and steps back.

""I have to go on duty,"" he changes the subject. ""I might… come by later tonight.""

""What duty?"" I blurt.

He looks at me again. There's a lot he doesn't say in that one glance.

""…You'll find out,"" he says.

Then, as if escaping my questions, he grabs a can of his usual drink, tosses some coins on the counter, and walks out.

The sensor chimes. The door shuts a little harder than usual.

I stand there, watching his back recede through the glass.

I know he's hiding something.

I just don't know which is worse— being kept in the dark, or knowing the truth.

—— **\[Male Lead's POV\]** ——

She still came.

Sethiel was right.

Humans are always like this— Even when they see the cliff ahead, they keep walking because it's the road they're used to.

I stand under the arcade outside the store, pretending to be an ordinary passerby, my back against the wall. My eyes haven't left her through the glass once.

Her uniform is a little worn; the collar's been washed pale. She's tied her hair up in a messy way, exposing a small strip of skin by her ear—thin, white.

Every customer who comes to buy something has to walk past her.

Her ""Thank you, come again"" isn't loud, but it's steady.

I know none of this has anything to do with me. I know I should do what Sethiel said: take my curse and stay as far away from any light as possible.

But as long as she stands under that too-bright ceiling at the register, I can't turn my back.

The radiation detector rests quietly in my palm. The numbers on the screen are normal. No abnormal spikes.

But I don't need those cold numbers to tell me danger is near—

I can smell it.

It's an old smell. Familiar. Like that night a thousand years ago, when the fire of war reached the edge of the forest, and the wind dragged blood and burnt wood to my feet.

After that night, I never smelled flowers on her again.

Now she's standing inside a convenience store, next to a cheap coffee and microwaved lunches. Yet the scent around her overlaps with that forest in my memory.

Bit by bit. Thread by thread. Slowly seeping out.

It's her.

Even if I've forgotten her name, forgotten her face, forgotten what happened between us—

I still know it's her.

Sethiel knows it too.

That's the problem.

I glance up at the sky.

The clouds hang low, like something heavy is about to fall out of that grey.

He's coming.

—— **\[Female Lead's POV\]** ——

Time grinds its way to eleven-thirty.

Outside, it's raining again. Drops streak down the glass in thin lines. There are hardly any pedestrians left on the street; only a few taxis pass every now and then.

It's brighter inside the store than outside. So bright it's almost harsh.

I'm crouched in the drinks aisle, pushing the bottom row of bottled water forward to restock, when the door sensor dings above my head.

Reflexively, I say, ""Welcome—""

The rest of the sentence dies in my throat.

It's him.

The Long-Haired Man.

He hasn't brought an umbrella today. Rain runs down his hair onto his shoulders, but doesn't make clear drops on the floor— as if the water evaporates before it hits.

He walks in at the same unhurried pace as last night, almost graceful.

This time, he doesn't look for Silent Man— because Silent Man isn't in the store.

His gaze lands straight on me.

Suddenly I feel like I've been targeted by something.

""…Can I help you, sir?"" I stand up and force on my customer smile.

""You.""

He says.

That single word doesn't carry any emotion. If anything, it sounds like he's ordering off a menu.

The corner of my mouth twitches. ""Sorry, we don't sell staff here.""

A small smile tugs at his lips—as if he's mildly amused, or watching some animal that hasn't realized what it is yet.

""What's your name?"" he asks.

I freeze. ""…That's a little much for a first-time customer—""

""Not the first time,"" he cuts in, calmly denying it. ""I've been looking for you for a long time.""

""…I don't remember owing you money,"" I say, a bit guilty, a bit defiant.

His gaze lingers on my face.

The way he looks is strange— not checking whether I'm pretty, not weighing if I'm worth flirting with, but confirming whether some image that's overlapped in his mind a thousand times matches what's in front of him.

My scalp prickles.

""Your name,"" he repeats, like he's claiming something that already belongs to him. ""Tell me.""

""…What for?"" I mutter. ""It's not like you're filling in a survey.""

""You don't have to say it."" He smiles. ""I can read it myself.""

I assume he means my name tag—there is one on my chest, though I've pinned it crooked for so long the print is partly scratched off.

But he isn't looking at my chest.

He's looking at—

my eyes.

In that instant, I feel something cold touch my gaze. Like an invisible tendril sliding along my eyeballs and into my head.

It doesn't hurt, but it's deeply uncomfortable— like someone rummaging through a box of old things I don't want touched.

""Wait—"" I instinctively step back, trying to turn my head away, but my ankles feel nailed to the floor.

He doesn't move closer, doesn't raise a hand. He just looks.

For a few seconds, the world goes silent. The AC, the fridges, the rain—they all fade into the distance. All I hear is my heartbeat pounding in my ears.

Then he speaks.

""Jiang—Han—Na.""

He draws out every syllable, slowly, like savoring something he hasn't tasted in a long time.

My back tightens. ""How do you—""

I'm sure I've never told him my name. I didn't hear him ask for it last night either.

Customer receipts only print our employee numbers, not our full names.

So how—

""This name,"" he muses, looking at me, ""suits the way you are right now.""

""…The way I am now?"" I tighten my grip around the pen in my hand. ""What's that supposed to mean?""

""Not awakened yet,"" he says gently.

When he speaks, his eyes shift for a moment.

Not the deep brown from earlier. Ink with a drop of gold, spreading slowly from the center of his pupils.

My chest suddenly feels hot.

Not my heart—deeper than that. Like there's a stone buried inside me, and someone just tapped it.

A current shoots up my spine. I suck in a breath.

""Who… are you?"" I hear myself ask.

He doesn't answer right away. Instead, he tilts his head slightly, looking toward the glass door.

Outside, the rain has stopped at some point. The wet street glows under the neon, exactly like last night.

""My name is Sethiel,"" he finally says, as if it's trivial. ""For now, you can think of me as—""

His gaze comes back to me. The gold in his eyes has fully opened.

""—someone who's here to witness your change.""

""…Change?"" I echo. ""Change what—""

Before I can finish, the sensor chimes.

Silent Man bursts through the door.

He usually walks like he's afraid to disturb anyone. Right now, he's practically sprinting, fast enough that he almost slips, shoulder slamming into the doorframe without slowing.

His eyes find Sethiel first, then snap to my face.

""Stay away from her,"" he almost snarls.

The sound startles me— not because of the volume, but because of what's in it.

Fear.

And killing intent.

Sethiel raises a brow.

""Perfect timing,"" he says, like tonight's show is finally starting. ""I just heard some good news.""

He turns to me and smiles, and the smile is infuriatingly good-looking.

""Jiang Hanna,"" he says my name again, this time each syllable like a declaration. ""You think you're just a convenience-store clerk, don't you?""

My throat tightens. I can't answer.

He doesn't wait for me.

""But a long time ago,"" he continues, head tipped slightly as if watching a picture only he can see, ""that's not how your name was spoken.""

""In the forest, where the light fell. When everyone looked up to pray—""

""Your name was louder than any blessing.""

My fingers dig into my palm.

""I don't understand what you're talking about,"" I manage. ""You've definitely got the wrong person.""

""Impossible,"" Sethiel denies, softly, almost tender. ""Blood remembers.""

When he says ""blood,"" something almost sickly-bright burns in his eyes.

I shiver.

Silent Man suddenly steps in, fisting Sethiel's collar and yanking him away from the counter.

For the first time, I see Silent Man actually use strength— the line of his arm tenses, muscles under the uniform waking up; his eyes aren't the usual dark, evasive black, but carry a harsh, desperate light.

""Sethiel."" He bites the name out, one syllable at a time. ""Don't talk like that in front of her.""

""See?"" Sethiel says to me, tilting his head, completely ignoring the hand on his collar. ""He's always like this. Always trying to cover everything up for you.""

There's a hint of amusement in his tone—like he really does find it funny.

""But he keeps forgetting…"" Sethiel smiles faintly. ""Light can't be covered.""

Silent Man's knuckles tighten.

""You still have a choice,"" he rasps, looking at me. ""Turn around now. Walk away. Never come back here—""

""No,"" Sethiel cuts in. ""She's already heard her name.""

He turns back to me.

For a ridiculous second, I feel like I'm standing at a crossroads— one path leading to the ordinary life I know, the other into somewhere I can't see the end of.

And I'm not the one walking.

It's my name pushing me.

""Do you think you're ordinary?"" Sethiel asks me slowly. ""You think your whole life will just be this? Convenience store. Small room. Worn out where no one can see you?""

His voice is light, but it sounds exactly like the thoughts I don't dare say out loud.

My mouth opens, but no words come out.

""That's a pity,"" he says.

""Because you were never ordinary.""

As he says that, the lights in the store flicker with a harsh buzz.

The AC pauses for a second. Then resumes.

Like someone, somewhere, has quietly flipped a switch.

Sethiel's smile deepens.

""Your name has finally come back,"" he murmurs. ""Now it just depends on whether you want to wake up.""

When those words land, I feel that buried stone in my chest crack a little wider.

Outside, the rain has started again. At some point, without me noticing.",1,1765796779.0,u_RedRoseScribe,0,1.0,False

1pn4mw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianAccounting/comments/1pn4mw8/struggling_with_social_anxiety_internship/,Struggling with social anxiety internship,"Hi all, posting anonymously because I’m genuinely stuck and would really appreciate some advice.

I’ve just started my vacationer program in audit, and we were all assigned a “buddy.” Mine is actually a really nice person, he even messaged me before the program started, so this isn’t a case of someone being rude or unkind. The problem is… I really struggle socially, especially in group settings, and I tend to shut down or dissociate when I don’t know what to say.

For context, I’m not good at small talk at all. I avoid speaking rather than risk saying something stupid, and I honestly don’t know how I ended up in audit given how awkward I am socially.

My buddy asked me for a coffee catch-up early on. I thought it would be one-on-one, which I was already nervous about, but then he invited another colleague along as well. That immediately put me on edge. They were already talking when I arrived, mostly about AFL (which I know nothing about), and I didn’t know how to insert myself into the conversation. Neither of them really looped me in, so I just froze and went silent.

It got awkward enough that they noticed, wrapped things up quickly, and we all left. In the elevator, I didn’t even know what to do or say anymore, so I just stood there and turned away. I left feeling pretty awful... faced my back fore reference :,))

Since then, things have felt off. My buddy told me to ask him questions anytime, but when I did ask about some testing/control stuff, he brushed it off and told me I didn’t need to know it yet or to ask the AM instead. So naturally, I started asking the AM more, especially since my buddy often says he’s not sure himself.

Socially, I’m also not used to initiating greetings. He doesnt say it, but expects me to say good morning, and I can tell he notices when I forget — which just makes me more anxious. Recently, he asked for another coffee catch-up, this time with even more colleagues, and my brain just completely checked out.... I did try to insert myself in the conversation, but stuffed up.... It’s been about three weeks now, and I’ve started avoiding him altogether because I don’t know how to interact anymore. He barely looks me in the eye now, and conversations feel forced or nonexistent.... I just dont really talk nor approach if I dont have to....

When it comes to work, I mostly interact by focusing on tasks. I tend to ask for more work or clarification because that’s the one area I feel somewhat confident in. He did tell me that as a vacationer I won’t be doing much, and that there’s no pressure — that the main expectation is really just to socialise and get to know people.

The problem is, I’m genuinely bad at socialising. When I don’t know what to say, my instinct is to compensate by focusing even more on work and tasks, because that feels safer and more structured. It’s not that I don’t want to connect... it’s just the only way I know how to function without completely shutting down.

To be fair, I’ve noticed he also seems a bit awkward himself (lots of fidgeting), so I don’t think this is intentional on his part. But the situation keeps spiralling in my head, and I don’t know how to reset things.

**What I’m hoping to get advice on:**

Is this something I should proactively address, or should I just let it be?

How do you survive buddy coffee chats when you’re bad at small talk?

Is it normal to rely more on the AM than your buddy?

Any tips for navigating social expectations in audit/Big 4 when you’re introverted or socially anxious?

How do I stop avoiding someone without making it even more awkward?

I really want to do well in this program and not be remembered as “the awkward quiet one,” but I also don’t want to force myself into situations where I completely shut down.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks for reading.",2,1765796459.0,AustralianAccounting,2,0.75,False

It’s good to see this market reviving after being quiet for nearly a decade. There used to be Eclipse Cafe back in the day which later shut down. After that Xinhua Chinese Restaurant opened here but eventually closed as well. The welder shops and general stores that were there also closed a long time ago likely because F-10 Markaz is right in front so most people preferred going there instead.

Here are 9 brands spending €100K+/month on EU ads specifically (and what's working for them)...,"My last post about top performance marketing brands got some attention, so I thought I'd make a follow-up.

This time I'm focusing on brands actually spending hundreds of thousands on the EU/UK market specifically. These are the brands with massive active ad counts in Europe. Most of them have way more ads running outside the EU, which means they're operating at an even higher scale worldwide.

After receiving feedback that some of the brands were ""branding"" plays, I decided to focus 100% on performance brands. These are performance-focused DTC and app brands optimizing for ROAS, testing creative strategies weekly, and scaling what works.

Here are 9 brands crushing it in EU/UK (and also WW) right now:

# 1. Loop (14,022 active ads)

Premium earplugs that turned a commodity product into a fashion accessory.

They're running ads in 11 different languages with 182M+ total EU reach. Their localization game is unmatched — same winning concepts adapted for every major market. They let winners run for 200+ days while constantly testing new angles.

[**Example 1**](https://skaler.app/ad/1225102349320243) – Launched 222 days ago, live. 8.9M EU reach (💰💰💰 \~€107K spend)  
[**Example 2**](https://skaler.app/ad/1275477364246325) – Launched 126 days ago, live. 4.4M EU reach, 3x creative (💰💰 \~€53K spend)  
[**Example 3**](https://skaler.app/ad/2015663765868742) – Launched 88 days ago, live. 4.1M EU reach, 3x creative (💰💰 \~€49K spend)

**Their top hook (used in 114 ads):**

    This discount won't wait forever.

Simple urgency. They also crush it with ADHD-focused messaging (""People with ADHD are not just lazy and unmotivated"") and gifting angles.

# 2. The Ridge (1,276 active ads)

Wallet and accessories brand that made wallets cool again with premium materials and smart features.

They focus on English-only content for US/UK markets but dominate with product-led storytelling. Their Kintsugi collection ran for 258 days with 4.3M reach — they find winners and let them run.

[**Example 1**](https://skaler.app/ad/960331649418900) – Launched 258 days ago. 4.3M EU reach (💰💰 \~€52K spend)  
[**Example 2**](https://skaler.app/ad/734512885752065) – Launched 158 days ago. 1.5M EU reach (💰 \~€18K spend)  
[**Example 3**](https://skaler.app/ad/1531497301214409) – Launched 39 days ago, live. 1.4M EU reach (💰 \~€17K spend)

**Their top hook (used in 10 ads):**

    Your wallet sucks. That's why we invented the Ridge Wallet.

Direct, provocative, and positions them as the solution. They also dominate wedding ring content with hooks like ""Men's wedding rings suck, so we created something better.""

# 3. HexClad (843 active ads)

Gordon Ramsay-backed cookware brand that's mastered the ""lifetime warranty"" angle.

They run a mix of celebrity endorsement (Gordon), UGC testimonials, and recipe content. The ""why it costs €1000"" justification ads perform incredibly well — they're not hiding the price, they're explaining the value.

[**Example 1**](https://skaler.app/ad/674675868548161) – Launched 84 days ago, live. 4.9M EU reach (💰💰💰 \~€59K spend)  
[**Example 2**](https://skaler.app/ad/2998387620362711) – Launched 68 days ago, live. 2.7M EU reach (💰💰 \~€32K spend)  
[**Example 3**](https://skaler.app/ad/1539745014031292) – Launched 68 days ago, live. 1.6M EU reach (💰 \~€19K spend)

**Their top hook (used in 17 ads):**

    This is the best gift on the planet.

They lean heavily into gifting and holiday angles. Also crushing it with ""Why I'll NEVER buy Gordon Ramsay's non-toxic pan"" reverse psychology hooks. I found this hook across A LOT of brands and it's been working well for us too.

# 4. Leaf Co (318 active ads)

French skincare brand dominating the collagen mask niche with before/after testimonials.

They're 100% focused on the French market with UGC from real women (especially mature skin). The transformation format is simple but incredibly effective — they show the mask going on, time passing, and the visible results.

[**Example 1**](https://skaler.app/ad/1714420702547346) – Launched 100 days ago, live. 6.4M EU reach, 5x creative (💰💰💰 \~€77K spend)

# 6. Endel (8 active ads but 11M+ reach)

The ultimate example of quality over quantity. This ADHD/focus app runs just 8 active ads but achieves massive scale.

They found the perfect hook — 852 Hz sounds for ADHD brains — and let it run. Their meme-style content (""me listening to this sound 24/7 ever since I found out it blocks your brain from overthinking"") drives insane engagement.

[**Example 1**](https://skaler.app/ad/1860830991492795) – Launched 47 days ago, live. 6.3M EU reach, 2x creative (💰💰💰 \~€76K spend)

**Their top hook:**

    This sound is 852 Hz. If you have ADHD, listen for 10 seconds and see how your brain reacts.

Interactive hooks that make you stop and actually engage. The meme format also works incredibly well — a dog on a train with text about blocking overthinking went viral.

# 7. AG1 by Athletic Greens (362 active ads)

The supplement giant with aggressive German/Dutch localization.

They run problem/solution format ads targeting morning fatigue, brain fog, and digestion issues. The Black Friday bundle offers with ""€88 GRATIS"" value stacking perform exceptionally well in German markets.

# 8. WHOOP (45 active ads)

Wearable fitness tracker with aggressive EU localization push.

They're running Portuguese, German, and English variants of discount offers. The ""10% off annual memberships"" angle is consistent across all markets — they've found what works and are scaling it geographically.

# 9. Reverse Health (33 active ads)

Intermittent fasting app crushing it in Italian and Spanish markets.

They use localized testimonials and ""lose X kg without exercise"" messaging. The before/after transformation format dominates their creative strategy.

**Their top hook (used in 3 ads):**

    Il tuo caffè nero senza zucchero. Vuoi un dessert?
    (Your black coffee without sugar. Want a dessert?)

Conversational Italian that feels native, not translated.

# Key Patterns I Noticed

**1. Localization separates the winners:** Loop runs 11 languages, AG1 dominates German markets, Leaf Co owns French skincare. The brands winning in EU aren't just translating — they're actually creating native content (and possibly have in-house deps for it).

**2. Before/after still works:** Leaf Co, Reverse Health, and even HexClad (for cookware results) all use transformation content. It's an evergreen format.

**3. Let winners run:** Endel runs 8 ads with 11M+ reach. The Ridge ran one ad for 258 days. Loop keeps winners live for 200+ days. Don't retire what's working.

**4. Duplicated creatives within different audiences:** Multiple brands run the same creative across 3-5x ad sets with different targeting. Leaf Co runs their best UGC across 5 different ads. This only shows they're either scaling or testing different audiences.

**5. Urgency works (when done right):** The Essence Vault's ""price hike incoming"" angle, Loop's ""discount won't wait forever,"" WHOOP's ""still time to save"" — urgency drives action.

I found out cus I got in contact with an old friend today cus she was like let’s go out for coffee and when I told her who I ended up with she was honestly disgusted and was like “why would you after what he did to \_\_\_?” 

she said he was never the initiator but supported it and sent around a video at one point of them pouring hot food on her head which was two weeks before this friend took her life. talked to my bf and he seemed really remorseful and apologetic but can I even get past that? He was 15-16. it was in fact years ago and he was young but I don’t think I can see him the same anymore. I mentioned breaking up and he acted really shocked which is making me rethink that decision? Or atleast to take a break to decide if I still wanna be with him. Me bringing it up and his reaction to that confused me so much more because at first thought I thought it would’ve been right. 

Also his friends are saying I’d be being dramatic and it’s not like it was anytime recent and I wasn’t that close with the friend so I’d be doing it to seem like a martyr to the friend that was asking why I wasn’t with him. I hate his friends but now I can’t see that action as anything but doing it because she asked why im with him, and that’s what made me think??? but also how can anyone get over their partner doing that to a human being and it was my friend. We weren’t sisterly close but she was one of my good friends, even then I feel like I’d have a right to have emotions anout it because thats still a person??

I don’t know, I felt right about it but now everyone’s reactions are confusing me and maybe there is smehing im not seeing. Would I be dramatic or overreacting / doing too much if I break up with him over this?

Did I overreact?,"I joined a local baby group back in September, hoping it would be good for my baby and help me feel less isolated as a mum. Most of the mums already knew each other, and while they would talk to me if I spoke first, I never really felt included or brought into conversations.

The group felt quite cliquey. I’d often just be sat there with my coffee while my baby was rolling around doing her thing, and I wouldn’t actually be talking to anyone. I know the group is technically for the babies’ development, but it’s hard being there and still feeling completely on your own.

I don’t get to attend every week because of appointments and general life with a baby, so the group chat is the only way I can keep up with what’s going on. The problem is the chat moves really fast and important info gets buried.

I missed the Halloween event (it was a spooky trail) because I didn’t see it in time. I was disappointed but didn’t dwell on it, thinking I’d make sure to go to the Christmas one if they did one.
Then I found out there was a Christmas event where babies got to see Father Christmas, and I missed that too because I didn’t realise it was happening.

That really upset me. I would’ve loved my baby to experience that, and it hurt knowing we missed out again just because I couldn’t keep up with hundreds of messages.

I did message saying I’d only just seen it and that I find it hard to keep track in the chat, then I left the group because it was stressing me out and making me feel worse, not better.

I’ve spoken to family about it and they said that ideally there should have been two separate chats one just for important event info and one for general chatting so things don’t get missed by parents who can’t attend regularly.

Part of me feels guilty because it’s not necessarily their fault, but another part of me feels like a baby group should be welcoming and accessible especially for parents who can’t attend every week.

1pn4bzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pn4bzq/something_was_wrong_about_ms_katz/,Something was wrong about Ms. Katz,"When I first met my neighbor, Ms. Katz, she scared the shit out of me.

I was walking up the cracked sidewalk to her front door to introduce myself because I had just finished moving in and wanted to start getting to know my neighbors. The house was uniquely large compared to all of the other homes on the street; adorned with steep slanted roofs and vertical wooden framing, a cacophony of plants bursting over the back yard fence on either side.

It was the house that ended the street; the pavement of the road and sidewalk abruptly cut off into grass.

The door was thick wood that looked like it weighed a ton. The brass gargoyle door knocker rapped loudly, echoing into the house as I stood for a moment waiting for a reply. I jumped when a creaky voice from my left said,

“Hello there Deary.” I turned to look down at a cheery old woman’s face that was wrinkled in a closed-eyed smile. I was startled, it felt like she had scared me on purpose.

The backyard gate slammed shut and I noticed that the old woman was wiping dirt off of her hands; she must have been gardening. “Hello to you as well! I just moved in next door.” I said, trying to be friendly.

“Welcome to Belmont Avenue, my name is Catrina Katz, just call me Katz deary.” She opened her eyes and continued smiling, but I was taken aback again. Her eyes were yellow. Very yellow. They looked like sickly saucers of spoiled milk. My apprehension turned to empathy for Ms.Katz - yellow eyes can mean liver problems, something my own grandmother had struggled with it for years.

“I just wanted to say hello, I am going to go get back to unpacking, you should come over for dinner sometime! Nice meeting you,” I said.

“I’m sure I will deary,” Ms.Katz said, then she turned back towards the backyard gate, glancing one more time at me before getting to her gardening, and I went back to my new home, which was filled with boxes that needed my attention.

That night I slept poorly, the house was dead quiet, the only noise was the air conditioning unit kicking on every once in a while.

I am a very light sleeper, so that’s why I woke up when a strange noise started permeating through the edges of my sleepy consciousness.

There was a sound so quiet that a normal person would have slept through it\*.\* I lay covered in my bed, sensitive ears straining to discern what the noise was. It sounded like someone was digging in mud.

I sat up, trying to quiet my breathing so I could hear where it was coming from, but my wooden floors made the sound reverberate from all directions in my room. I could not work up the courage to get out bed and investigate, something told me I should just lay down and put on some white noise to ignore it.

Every night for a week did just that, ignoring the noise and getting some decent sleep.

When I asked my other neighbor Todd - a nice middle-aged truck driver- one day if he had heard the noise he said he didn’t know anything about it,

“I bet you it’s Ms. Katz. You can catch her out pretty late sometimes. Between you and me, I think she has a bit of dementia. Just a bit. She loves her gardening. I’ve even seen her doing it at night which is weird but to each their own. She must love it. She imports special fertilizer all the time. Here comes a truck now.” He nodded towards her house.

A van pulled into the driveway. It had a purple flower logo on the metal siding that was indeed befitting of a fertilizer company. A burly man dressed in all black greeted Ms. Katz at her gate and started carrying brown sacks into her back yard. She noticed us watching and gave a cheery wave to us, while we waved back Todd said,

“Really sweet woman. I’ve known her for years. She’s been living on Belmont Avenue as long as anyone can remember. Makes great apple pie.”

I decided to see the garden for myself that afternoon.

I made it look like I was cleaning my gutters, which to be fair, were disappointingly dirty no thanks to my landlord. I stood up on my roof to peer over the bushes spilling into my back yard, only then realizing what a jungle Ms. Katz’s backyard was. Bushes, flowers, vines, short and tall trees, birdbaths, stone pathways, you name it. If Ms. Katz was really doing it all herself, it had to have taken up all of her time. The garden was in pristine condition and scattered throughout the yard were the large brown fertilizer sacks, some ripped open with black soil spilling out.

There was a smell that rose out of the backyard and drifted towards me as I studied the garden. A sickly-sweet stench that was quite pungent. I could see lavender, rose and dracaena flowers so it was possible they were responsible for the strange odor.

Something was wrong though. A part of my brain was reminded at the time of how my grandfather’s large liquid fly traps smelled when they were full to the brim with dead insects. I was also reminded of rancid meat you discovered had been molding in the back of your fridge for weeks.

An itch on the back of my neck grew while I was scouting. It took me a minute to notice the yellow eyes peering at me between large purple curtains out of the corner of my vision. I was startled and turned to look back at Ms.Katz, unsure of how long she had been staring at me. She waved and smiled, nodding towards her garden like It was quite special before going inside.

I couldn’t be sure but before I turned to face her I could’ve sworn she was looking at me with a face contorted in utter hatred.

It was 9 nights ago when I watched Ms. Katz die.

When I woke, I was confused. I could make out the soft noise from nights before that still somehow demanded every ounce of my attention. I looked to my nightstand and realized my phone was not playing my white noise, I must have forgotten to turn it on.

I decided it was time to confront Ms. Katz. If she really did have dementia, maybe I could just talk to her and she would realize she should be asleep and not doing whatever weird shit she was doing in the middle of the night.

I crept through the house, slowly opening the back door. The sound of crickets and rustling leaves mixed with the digging noise that was now sharp and clear. I could not stop myself from approaching a peephole in the fence.

When I was a few spans from the fence the sound suddenly stopped. I froze, waiting. A rhythmic thumping noise started coming down over the fence. What was she up to now? I had to know what she was doing. One eye closed, I peered through the hole into the back yard. 

The back yard looked like it did when I last saw it, winding stone paths now illuminated by moonlight. More fertilizer bags were open and the garden beds were torn up like plants were being rearranged.

I quickly found her. Ms.Katz was on a ladder pulling at one of the fertilizer bags which was stuck in one of her second story windows. Pulling does not properly describe the motion. Ms. Katz was throwing her body weight faster than what seemed possible away from the window, the bag inching with each heave. She thrashed again and again and again. It looked like it hurt. It looked like her arms should have dislocated.

I started panicking, clearly Ms. Katz had more than “a little bit of dementia” like Todd had said. I needed to help her, to get her to a hospital and make sure she was mentally sound. But it was too late.

Suddenly Ms. Katz lost her grip on the bag, the cloth tearing from the tensile force, and in an instant was falling off of the ladder. She was weightless, air whipping her stained nightgown about while she plummeted. A pit formed in my stomach when I saw where she would land, the inevitable becoming more terrifying with each second.

\*SPLAT.\*

One of the short concrete bird baths that had a pointed house had completely pierced the abdomen of the elderly woman. I stood frozen while I processed what was happening.

Not a single cry was uttered. Her death was instant, a hole the size of a basketball oozing blood where her stomach had been made me fall to knees and retch into the grass.

I grabbed my phone and dialed 911 as I started frantically searching for my dinky ass Walgreens first aid kit. An operator picked up.

The operator asked in a calm voice,

""911 what is your emergency?""

“My neighbor is dead! She fell off a ladder and impaled herself on a bird bath!"" I yelled, panting as I sprinted down the sidewalk.

The operator was clearly used to these kinds of calls, “Ok slow down sir. What is the address?”

“414 Belmont Avenue. Please hurry! Please!” I stammered out as fast as I could,

“What is her name sir?”

“Catrina Katz. She’s bleeding please-”

“Sir, is this a joke?”

“What do you mean? I’m telling you the truth”

I stopped in my tracks. I was so high on adrenaline I couldn’t understand what was happening.

“We’ve had at least eight calls like this in the past year. Ms. Katz has always been fine when we respond.”

“I don’t understa-“

“She is an elderly lady who does not need this harassment. I will not repeat myself. If you call again, I am sending an officer to arrest you for misuse of the 911 line. Goodbye.” The operator hung up.

The only sound left was my heavy breathing. I found myself walking towards the backyard gate, my momentum was the only thing that kept me going.

I pushed open the gate, scanning the backyard. There was no ladder laying on the ground.  Ms.Katz was gone. Somehow she was not skewered on the bird bath as she had been a minute ago. I kept moving forward, unable to stop myself from approaching the bird bath.

It was clean, its undisturbed state mocked my fear and panic. There was no blood, but when I touched the concrete bird bath house, it was warm.

I felt a pit in my stomach; the world was spinning around me. My head was pounding.

“Deary, what are you doing this time of night?” a sweet voice said, I whipped around. I felt like I was sinking into hysteria. 

The back door stood open, the wooden arch frame filled by Ms. Katz’s figure. There was no obvious sign of a gaping stomach wound, she appeared to have just woken up. She was looking at me, concern plain on the wrinkles of her face.

I could see into the house. A few old lamps were turned on. I could just make out old some ornate furniture covered in dust. The inside of the house certainly matched the outside.

There was something that caught my eye. It was one of the large fertilizer bags with the purple flower logo. Torn open and spilling over a wooden table onto the floor, the bag was not full of black soil. The bag was full of a bright flesh, indiscriminate chunks glistening in the lamp light.

“DEAR! I SAID ARE YOU OK?”, Ms. Katz yelled, snapping my eyes away from the bag of flesh. She was no longer a sweet old woman who wanted to make sure I was alright, her yellow eyes were strained open, demanding an answer from me, an explanation,

“I uh… I thought…” I stood there, mouth working, I couldn’t think. “I heard some commotion, I wanted to make sure everything was alright,” I stammered out, it seemed impossible that I was talking to someone that I just saw die. I felt nauseous. Doubt was flooding my mind. Was this real? Was I dreaming?

Ms. Katz’s face eased into her usual sweet smile,

“No commotion deary. I promise you everything is alright. Go back home and get some rest. I am sure you will forget all about it in the morning” She looked at me, still smiling, but the smile did not reach her eyes, “it’s late. People go missing at night so you better be careful.”

She turned and slammed the door.

I did not sleep that night. Instead, I turned on every light in the house and locked myself in my bedroom. I played the events of the night over and over again in my head. Every time I convinced myself it was real, I would convince myself I must have dreamed it; had some kind of lucid nightmare. But nightmares don’t leave 911 calls on your phone history or dirt strung throughout your house. Nightmares don’t live next door.

In my shaken state come morning the only thing to do was to go to work. Work was consistent, and I figured it would sort things out for me to pretend everything was normal.

After I downed a third cup of coffee I strode out the door, the sun catching on morning fog welcomed me to a new day.

Todd stepped out of his door right after me. We nodded to each other, Todd’s expression soured when he saw something behind me. “None of my damn business,” Todd grumbled around a cigarette in his lips. I turned to see what he had seen.

A van with a large purple flower logo was backed up to Ms. Katz’s house, a few men unloading fertilizer bags. A part of me wanted to be drawn back into the events of last night. I pushed it down.

I decided Todd was right. It was not any of my business.

A full day of work set me back to a sense of normalcy. Pushing pencils for eight hours really clears your mind.

That night was silent, and I slept sounder than a hibernating bear without the need for a white noise machine. I waved to Ms. Katz when I saw her on my excursions out of the house. She often was garbed in gardening clothes, going in and out of her backyard. None of my business. For six days all was well.

Until I woke up three nights ago, soaked in sweat, muffled screaming filling my room.

I once had a friend of mine lose his arm. We were playing on some rocks in a forest during a camping trip, jumping back and forth between larger boulders, taking turns giving chase to one another. I was laughing while I chased my friend, both of us grinning ear to ear while we played.

My friend was climbing higher and higher up the slope of the mountain, taking each gap in one big stride at a time, taunting me to catch him. Just before my little pointer finger could reach out and tag him, he lost his footing and slipped.

I watched as my friend fell towards the ground below, and stood frozen as he began screaming in pain, bloody arm raised in the air, bone snapped in half at the forearm, sharp white bone dangling in two directions.

I had never heard so much pain expressed before. My friend screamed until his voice was raw, thrashing about on a rock below. If I had acted sooner, running down the mountain to grab our parents, my friend might have saved his arm. But as a kid I just stood frozen to the spot, unable to move.

I was frozen then, in my bed, as I listened to the pain unfolding before me.

“Help me please! Oh god! Oh god!”, it was muffled, the words could just barely be made out, but the pain was sharp and visceral.

A part of me wanted to roll over, turn on the white noise machine, and pretend I hadn’t heard anything. But I knew what I was going to do.

I grabbed a knife from the kitchen, forcing myself to take one step after another towards the house next door. There was no doubt this time. This was real. I needed to be braver, to not freeze, to help this person. The screaming grew clearer as I approached the house, slid through the gate and approached the back door.

“I’m so sorry! I promise….” the voice screeched. It was definitely coming from her house, I had to stop whatever was going on. I reached for the door,  knife held at the ready, swallowing when my hand grabbed the knurled knob and began to twist.

“I cant! I..”, the yelling suddenly cut off, stillness now deafening. Somehow the hinges of the door slid across each other smoothly, silently revealing the darkness of the house. Once inside, I let out the breath I hadn’t realized I was holding as quietly as possible.

I moved through the room, past the old furniture, subconsciously aware of the bags of flesh strewn about, of the smell of death so rank I would normally empty the contents of my stomach. Passing old pieces of furniture covered in must, I found myself walking on kitchen tile, then rounding a doorway to face a steep wooden stairway.

Time started falling forwards on a fixed track, I was floating up the stairs. I barely noticed the loud thud that sounded like a deflated basketball was dropped.

Heat radiated from above, I was entering a tropical oven. The plaster of the walls was damp and rotted, wood molding visible in bare patches. A squelching noise started coming from upstairs and washing down over me.

I continued to move slowly towards the noise. At the top of the stairs was a hallway with closed side rooms and an open door at the end of the hall, the room behind the door illuminated by a sickly yellow ceiling light creeping out into the hall. Before I knew it I swung the door open, revealing the horrible scene inside.

It has taken me these days since that night to rationalize what I saw behind the door at the end of the hallway. In the moment my brain put my body into shock, I continued to act but was not comprehending how absolutely horrifying it all was.

The floor was covered in dirt and flesh. The two substances were mixed together to form a paste that was thick and gelatinous.

Ms. Katz’s head was staring at me, upside down in the mush, eyeless sockets fixed in my direction. The decapitated head looked something like a pale Jack-O-Lantern after weeks in the sun, all of the flesh had been scooped out from the inside. I could see through the eye sockets into the pale skull. The base of the head where the neck should be revealed a perfectly calcified circle that looked like a doll head might when you wrung it off of the body, a spacious cavity where a brain should be.

I peeled my eyes from the ground and looked forward.

A table was in the middle of the room. The rest of Ms. Katz was hunched over the table sitting on an old wooden stool. Her body was convulsing as something I couldn’t see was ripping into the chest of a dead body sprawled on the table. It must have been the person I had gone to save. Slurping and crunching filled the room.

There was screaming, it took me a second to realize that I was screaming.

Slowly the rest of Ms.Katz sat up from the table in the chair, out of the stump of her neck what looked like a slender frayed rope started stretching upward towards the ceiling. Brown and glistening like an insect carapace, slowly its head started rising from the dead body on the table, pulled upward until it was almost touching the ceiling. Tendrils roughly a foot in length sprouted like fuzzy antenna in all directions along the vine-like neck; they constantly moved and twitched as they felt their surroundings.

The head was covered in the same wriggly feelers, blacker than those on the neck. Once the head had risen almost five feet in the air, towering above me as an unholy obelisk, it twisted around to stare down at me.

Insect mandibles twitched and chomped, flesh smeared and stuck to the mouth area, falling down to the ground with thick splashes. The head was smaller than the discarded shell of a head on the ground by my feet, but the eyes were the same. The yellow eyes were large, bulging out of the hard carapace, no eyelids to conceal their bulbus shape. Its eyes were fixed on me, pure malice penetrating me to my core.

The next few moments occurred in the blink of an eye. Rapidly the tendrils of the neck started pulling the creature back into Ms. Katz. Each tendril would shoot down into the old woman’s body, accelerating the head downward. Sporadic jerks animated the her corpse, arms shooting out, a seizure of movements unfolding before me until the insectoid head was the only visible part of the parasite, resting on the body’s neck stump.

All was still, a standoff had begun. In shock I was rooted to the spot, a pit of dread opened up in my stomach and I became aware of my heart pounding in my ears.

It leaped toward me, pushing off the ground so hard I heard the floor break, crashing into me with force enough to break my ribs, sending us hurtling back through the hall way towards the stairs. On the ground we struggled, I somehow managed to grab its shoulders and pushed with all of my strength as it tried to pop my head open with its layers of jaws.

A full throated roar came out of me and I heaved us down the stairs. Each step smacked on the way down, at the bottom I rolled into the kitchen onto my back. I had broken ribs and an ankle twisted the wrong direction, so all I could do was crawl backwards from the stairwell door, where I could hear snapping sounds that meant it was getting up.

It forced Ms.Katz body to its feet, one arm disolacted and jutting upward, standing naked in the dark doorway. A fleshy stomach hole was filled with twisted knots of insectoid spaghetti where the bird bath had pierced through the body.  Its eyes were two yellow orbs of light swaying back and forth in the darkness of the doorway.

I noticed a shovel at my feet and frantically grabbed for it. I was too late. In the same moment I made my move, some of the knotted tendrils of Ms. Katz’s stomach wound shot out towards me.

The wet tendrils were thick and flew across the kitchen, striking my left shoulder and digging into my flesh. The muscles of the arm seized. My muscles were forced to contract harder than my brain would allow. Every single muscle cramped at the same time. My biceps relaxed as my triceps continued to flex which caused my arm to hyper extend. Bones cracked and my arm broke. I cried out in pain.

“Oh deary, I love the way you scream” it spoke to me with a voice that was broken, full of hateful mirth. It sounded like Ms. Katz was speaking while gargling crumbled bones. Suddenly my biceps flexed, snapping my arm the other way, my limp hand smacking into my shoulder. All I could do was grind my teeth and moan.

With my free arm holding the shovel I swung at the tendrils, severing them. It let out an ear blistering screech, insectoid head thrashing. Enraged, it crouched then lunged for me once more. I was ready this time.

Screaming my throat raw, I swung the shovel and hit it right between its eyes. One instant the shiny black mouth was going to tear my throat out, the next the carapace exploded, green slop flying in all directions. The body went limp and oozed all over me, tendrils seeping out over me onto the ground. The pungent smell of Ms. Katz body, old perfume, and rotting insect meat singed my nostrils. I could barely breath with all of the weight bearing down on me.

My shock wore off and panic set in. I frantically tried to push the corpse off of me, my hands slipping again and again, suffocating instigated desperation deep within me allowing me to drain the last of my strength to finally roll it off myself. Then I lay alone in the silent house.

I started sobbing. I took massive uncontrollable heaves of air into my body and let them out through tears and groans. I could not stop until every last possible emotion had been wailed out of me.

Once I was done, I stood numbly, used the shovel to limp my way out of the house, and packed a bag. I got into my car and rode out at dawn.

After a stop to the local urgent care where I told a true enough story about a bad fall down some stairs, I had a boot for my foot and bandages for my ribs. I drove as far as I could and stopped at a motel.

Three days later I am now writing from my third motel, slowly making my way back home, where I am going to try to forget all of this mess, and start over.

I am not sure what happened to Ms. Katz’s house or the bodies inside, and I don’t care. I needed to tell my story online because no one I know will believe me and because I am not sure if I will live to tell the tale anyways.

Every motel that I have stopped at has the same van that parks in the back of the lot at 3 am when I should be asleep and not notice. A van with a purple flower logo. They leave at 6 am before I should wake up.

I noticed each time because I have not slept since that night. I know I have nightmares waiting for me when I finally crash, but I am not ready to face them yet.

So I (F27) was talking to a colleague (M36) and I was telling him how lucky he was to not marry his toxic ex and not have kids with her. He was agreeing until I stated that he could just live childfree with a new partner and avoid all the bullshit kids entail.

Then he says ""IF I GET MARRIED AND DON'T HAVE KIDS MY PARTNER AND I WILL GET BORED OF EACH OTHER""!

I was so shocked by this sentiment, imagine what an uninteresting person you need to be to think this or how uninteresting you imagine your future partner to be.

I explained that there are so many possibilities, that you can have fun and travel and go hiking, see the world, enjoy every moment. To which he said how after the ""fucking and playing around"" people need to be adults and work towards a FUTURE together and towards BUILDING SOMETHING THAT LASTS - HAVING A LEGACY!!!

I was so fucking offended that I said I can't wait for him to find his future wife and ruin their marriage with kids and that we will have coffee in 10 years and YES MY FUTURE HUSBAND AND I WILL BE VERY MUCH IN LOVE WHILE HE'LL BE ALREADY DIVORCED. He didn't take that too well, oopsie.

Also I respect this man a lot and this was the 10th time we were speaking on this topic, he always tried to convince me how kids are amazing and I should have them ?! And I always pushed back and explained that as an English teacher I know too much to ever put myself in such a predicament. So yes, he deserved that.

I just can't believe that people really think that having kids makes a relationship fun ?! How clueless do you need to be to think that, God help these breeders and their lack of common sense. Rant over.",73,1765795031.0,childfree,46,0.99,False
