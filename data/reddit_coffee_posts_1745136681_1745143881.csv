Upgraded my grinder first to a Niche Zero last year prior to saving up for an espresso machine upgrade. I've tried reading a lot of reddit posts comparing some machines but some are outdated or hard to purchase in my country (Philippines). I'm not a super geek when it comes to making coffee and probably wouldn't have a time to master manual espresso or too much modding. Just a coffee loving person who wants to upgrade her delonghi dedica. Hope the budget doesn't go too overboard. Been looking at Profitec and Gaggia but don't know which one is better if with no mods and less learning curve hopefully. Thank you in advance",1,1745143626.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Too much noise, stimulation, or conversation quickly tires me out. I rarely turn down a quiet evening, a good book, or a coffee without company.

But sometimes, this silence makes me feel like no one is thinking of me anymore.
And that's where I find myself in this paradox: I crave solitude, but not isolation.

Do other introverts feel this way too?

Our families were very close and we often hosted dinners and lunches together. It was a messy breakup, which was my fault because of the way I broke up with him but we ended up speaking about it and are able to be civil with eachother now. My issue is that my mum is always texting his mum and asking when they can catch up for coffee. Just today I saw on her phone she sent her this massive paragraph wishing them a happy easter. In texts before that she asked what her days off were so they could organise a catch up. It seems to always be my mum reaching out to her. In my mums eyes, my ex was the most perfect man in the whole word (definitely not true) and sometimes I felt like she thought she was apart of the relationship. My ex would also always run to my mum whenever we would have disagreements or arguments and tell her it was my fault which she still believes to this day.

1k3j5yp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1k3j5yp/the_infestation_of_pikes_head_cove_alaska_part_1/,"The Infestation of Pike's Head Cove, Alaska (Part 1)","After the Army, I felt lost, unsure of what to do with myself or my life. I had joined up at the ripe age of 18, spending most of my illustrious 10-year career and my 3 tours in Afghanistan as a Military Working Dog Handler. After we pulled out of Afghanistan, however, with my current contract coming to an end, I felt that my time had come to move on, that I had done my part, but I just didn't know what it was I was supposed to be moving on to.



So, I drifted. With no real family or home to go back to, I bought a van and hit the road, saw the country. 



I bought a Belgian Malinois pup as well, which I named Rowdy, from an ex-military guy I knew. He had also worked as a Dog Handler, and now specifically bred and trained working dogs for people who wanted the real deal. 



Over the course of the next several months, Rowdy and I went on many great adventures together. We saw the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls. We camped out in Tahoe, Yellowstone, and Yosemite. All the while, our bond growing, as did Rowdy himself, and my extensive training with him paid off as he grew into a model working dog, and my best friend.



It wasn't long, however, until our traveling adventures began digging deep into my savings, and I knew we would have to settle down someplace soon before I went broke. So, that's when we made our way to Alaska. I had always pictured myself settling down there, in the last frontier, but didn't exactly know where, or what I would do for work.



We again drifted for a time, but this time, in the confines of the state, with the express goal of finding our new home. And eventually, we did just that.



The coastal town of Pike's Head Cove was perhaps the smallest I'd ever been to, with only a population of 182 people at the time of our arrival. There was only 3 ways in or out of the town, North and South tunnels carved through the mountains that bordered it, and by sea travel. It had one market, one mechanic's shop, one 24 hour diner that also served as the town bar or a place to rent a room for the night if the misses locked you out after a bender, and practically nothing else, as their economy completely consisted off the fishing trade.



You see, the town received its name for two reasons. One, that from an aerial view, the shape of the town and the cove it had developed around resembled the head of an open mouthed Pike. Two, that the cove itself and the section of the Arctic Sea beyond were mysteriously filled with a seemingly endless supply of Northern Pike.



Upon arriving in this town, I completely fell in love. I loved the quiet seclusion of it, the hardworking and welcoming nature of its people, and the cold sea that bordered it. So, I decided to make it my home.



I found a small house to rent. It had been left unoccupied for the better part of 2 years, as I had been the first person to move into town in that long.



Then, one night, I managed to corral the local fishing Captain of a vessel named the Helmsman, Captain Burke, a burly and grey bearded man, for drinks at the town diner, The Cove's Respite. 



We talked some about my military service and his, he was ex-Navy, and I emphasized throughout the night my passion for fishing, and how I was looking for work. This was mostly true, as I was an avid fisherman, even having been deep sea fishing a handful of times in my life, although I had no work experience in the field.



Several whiskeys into the night, Captain Burke finally relented, offering me a spot aboard his crew, under the condition that I prove myself capable of handling the job over a short trial period. I had to assume he had only done so given the fact that I was a military man, but work in town had been secured for me regardless.



That was also the night that I met Rachel. She was a beautiful brown haired woman in her late twenties that worked as a waitress, bartender, dish washer, basically whatever was needed of her at The Cove's Respite.



Upon seeing the banter and looks the two of us had been sharing over the course of the night, Captain Burke assured me that she was single, and that I should ask her out. 



So, I did.  



The next few months passed by in a breeze. I proved myself, through trial and error, among the crew of the Helmsman, and Captain Burke assured me a more permanent position within its ranks. My relationship with Rachel developed quickly, though maturely, and it looked as though it could be one that went the distance. I even began decorating my home and settling in, something I had never really had the chance to do before in my adult life.



Everything was going smooth as could be, until one day, aboard the Helmsman, I reeled in a Pike, only to drop it in horror at the sight of what was inside its open mouth. Where the Pike's tongue should have been, a white bug-like creature wriggled around in its place, staring back at me with tiny beady black eyes. 



""What the shit is that!?"" I exclaimed, pointing to the sickly thin looking Pike that wriggled about on the floor before me.



Captain Burke took notice and stomped over, grabbing ahold of the fish by the base of its head with one meaty paw of a hand and lifting it to eye level. ""A Fish Louse,"" he said matter of fact like with a curt nod.



""Fish Louse?"" I asked.



""Forget their scientific name,"" Burke continued. ""But they're Isopods, they replace the fish's tongue and live inside their mouth, stealing their food. They're pretty common around the cove for some reason. When I first discovered them out here, I looked into it online, and it said they prefer warm coastal waters along California and Mexico and such, so I don't know why they're out here in the Arctic, or how the hell they're surviving, let alone thriving like they are. It's not really a big deal though, they're harmless to humans, so we just cut the heads off the infected fish and sell them at the market regardless."" 



""So,"" Kajak, a middle-aged Inuit man with black hair pulled back into a bun and thin strands of greying facial hair lining his lips and jaw chimed in as he unhooked a Pike of his own. ""The Landlubber finally catches a Tongue Stealer.""



""I guess so,"" I said. ""Fucking creepy.""



Burke stomped over to a cutting board he already had prepared for the day, smacked the wriggling Pike down onto it, lifted up a big meat cleaver, and hacked down, severing its head in one blow. A stream of blood poured out from the Pike's open neck, soon to be washed back into the ocean from sea water that periodically splashed aboard.



A quiet yet echoing scream sounded off in the distance, over the foggy sea, and I turned my gaze out to find it.



""They always scream whenever he beheads one of their kin,"" Kajak said. ""It's a bad omen.""



I looked to him with concern, and then back to Burke as he tossed the head of the pike and the Isopod that lived within back into the sea before dropping the rest of the fish into a huge ice chest. ""Will you quit scaring the boy with your superstitions?"" Burke said. ""Green Gill,"" he called me, a fun little nickname for the newest member of the crew. ""Get back to work, you're burning daylight.""



""Right,"" I moved back to the edge of the Helmsman, reset my rod and lure, and then cast back into the gently waving cool blue of the Arctic Sea just outside of Pike's Head Cove.



""Oh shit,"" Arturo called out from his fishing spot aboard the Helmsman, the last Green Gill before I came aboard. ""I caught one too!""



I turned back as my line bobbed above the water, watching as Captain Burke made his way over and took the wriggling pike from the stocky Hispanic man. 



""Two in one day,"" Burke said as he stomped over to the still blood and sea water coated cutting board, smacking this fish down upon it just as he had the last. ""That's rare."" He hefted up the meat cleaver and whacked down, chopping off the Pike's head again in one mighty blow.



Another distant scream sounded out across the waves, and I looked to Kajak, meeting his gaze. ""I told you,"" was he all he said, causing a chill to run down my spine.



It wasn't just 2 Louse infested fish we had caught that day before making our way back to land, but 7, a new record according to the rest of the crew. And every single time Burke beheaded one of them, a distant scream sounded out across the sea, and Kajak would meet my gaze with concern.



As I made my way down the dock to reenter the town proper, I pulled out my walkie talkie to call Rachel. Cell service was non existent in Pike's Head Cove, so walkie's were a necessity if you wanted to have communication across town on the go, and for the most part, people respected each other's private channels and knew better than to listen in or talk on a channel that was designated for someone else. Ours was channel 14.



""Landlubber to Sexy Barmaid,"" I said into my walkie as I pressed the talk button. ""Come in, Sexy Barmaid, over.""



I let go of the talk button, and seconds later, Rachel's chuckle sounded out from the walkie. ""Will you stop it with the codenames already?""



""Negative, Sexy Barmaid,"" I responded. ""Landlubber has made shore, what's your ETA?""



""Well, I just got off work, and I still have to swing by the market to grab some fish and a few other things to make dinner. So I'd say, about an hour from now?""



Her mention of fish forced the terrifying little face of the tongue stealing Louse back into my mind, and I felt my guts roil at the thought of eating anything that could have possibly been infested by one of those creatures. ""On second thought,"" I said. ""Skip the fish for tonight. Let's do something else for dinner.""



""Everything but fish is too damn expensive right now, you know that,"" Rachel replied, and she was right. The market could sell fish for cheap, as it was caught and supplied daily by us fisherman, but practically everything else had to be delivered from out of town. That, combined with Alaska's already steep prices on groceries, because of how hard it was to farm or raise livestock here, made most things at the market far out of our price range. ""Besides, I don't really trust the frozen beef they sell. I feel like Marta sells it long past its expiration date, but just doesn't care since it's frozen.""



""Look,"" I said. ""Just get anything you want, anything that looks good, and I'll pay you back when you get to my place, just remind me. But please, no fish for tonight, just trust me.""



""Alright, if you're buying,"" Rachel said mischievously, as if she would go overboard shopping, even though I knew she wasn't the type of person to do such a thing. 



Arturo made his way down the dock then behind me, stopping momentarily to light up a cigarette.



Burke and Kajak closed in behind him, dragging carts behind them with ice chests filled with our daily catches resting atop them.



I realized then that I didn't actually have any cash on hand to pay her back with, and that the town bank would be closed for the night by now. ""I gotta go, Sexy Barmaid,"" I said. ""See you soon.""



""Aye Aye, Landlubber!"" She called back in a pirate accent before signing off.



I smiled at that, and then stuffed my walkie into one of the hand pockets of my big thermal coat. ""Hey, Cap'n!"" I called out as I jogged back over to my crewmates.



""Yes?"" Burke said as he came to a halt.



""Anyway I can get paid in advance for today?"" I asked. ""It's date night, but I don't have any cash to pay for dinner.""



Burke sighed, reaching around behind himself to retrieve his wallet from his back pocket. ""Yeah, I suppose so."" He reached into the thick stack of cash that rested within, pulling out 6 twenties and handing them over to me.



""Thanks, Cap'n,"" I said with a smile. ""You're the best.""



""Yeah, I know it,"" he said as Kajak came to a stop and held out his hand without saying a word. Burke sighed, and pulled out 8 twenties to give to him, and before the other man could even ask, pulled out another 7 to give to Arturo, nearly cleaning out his entire wallet, the other men of course getting paid more than myself as they had worked aboard the Helmsman for longer. ""Everyone happy now?"" Burke asked with exasperation before picking back up the handle to his fish hauling wagon.



Everyone nodded and smiled in agreement, like we were all children convincing our father to pay us allowance that would secretly be spent on bud and booze.



Kajak pulled out a wooden pipe then, its bowl already prefilled with a blend of tobacco and weed. He sparked a match and lit the whole bowl, taking several quick puffs from it to get the ember nice and ripe. ""Arturo, my friend,"" he said between puffs and exhales. ""You mind taking the haul to market with the Captain for me today? I also have a date night with the misses."" 



Arturo shook his head between drags of his cigarette. ""No, not at all,"" he said as he took up the handle of Kajak's fish cart for him and began following after the Captain.



Kajak caught him before he got too far away, offering him one of the twenties he had just received from Captain Burke, as bringing the fish to market with the Captain was part of Kajak's job and part of the reason why he got paid more that Arturo. So, it was only fair that Arturo received the extra pay for today, as Kajak was a man of principal.



""See you men bright and early on Monday!"" Captain Burke called back as he made his way in the direction of the town market, Arturo following closely behind him now. We worked a 6 day work week, having Sundays off, and today happened to be Saturday.



""Enjoy your weekend, Cap'n!"" I called back after him.



Kajak stayed standing on the dock, puffing from his pipe.



""Well, have a good weekend,"" I said, ready to head home to see Rowdy and wait for Rachel.



Kajak nodded, but didn't say anything as he continued sucking on his pipe.



I started away, when he spoke up from behind me. ""Landlubber,"" he said, calling my attention back to him.



""Yeah,"" I responded. ""What's up?""



""Be careful, and stay calm,"" he said. ""I'm worried about you. I see omens and portents more often around you. Been seeing you in my dreams.""



Coming from anyone else, this revelation may have creeped me out, but something about Kajak radiated a foreign wisdom from a culture I wasn't a part of, like he knew something that I couldn't possibly know, and that I should listen to his warnings and words of advice. ""What sort of dreams?"" Was all I could think to ask in the moment.



Kajak seemed to consider sharing his dreams with me, but then thought better of it, waving the prospect away with a shake of his head and swipe of his hand through the air. ""Go about you way, Tyler,"" he called me by my name for perhaps the first time since I'd met him. ""Just don't forget to listen when the world speaks to you. You're more perceptive to hearing her voice than most Landlubbers.""



I nodded. ""I won't forget,"" I said as I turned to leave, and I genuinely meant it. ""Goodnight, Kajak.""



""Goodnight, little brother,"" he said back as he also turned away, heading for his pickup truck, still puffing on his pipe as he went.



I hurried home then, greeting an excited Rowdy at the door and taking a quick shower before Rachel could get there.



When she arrived, I opened the front door to see her standing there, holding up a boxed frozen pizza in one hand with a wide grin. ""Looks like $20 freezer burnt pizza for dinner,"" she said, just managing to contain her laughter. ""Are you as excited as I am?"" 



""Oh,"" I replied in exaggeration. ""You have no idea."" I grabbed her then, pulling her inside into my warm embrace and greeting her with a kiss. ""I missed you,"" I said as I pulled back and looked into her piercing green eyes.



""I missed you, too,"" she replied, a bit of a blush taking over her cheeks before she leaned in for another kiss and then closed and locked the front door behind her.



We set the oven to preheat and opened up the pizza box, both laughing at the sight of the frozen wasteland that its surface had become during its months of travel and hand exchanges in order to even get here to grace the freezer aisle shelves of Marta's Market.



As the pizza cooked, I paid Rachel back her $20, we cracked open a few beers, lit up a joint, popped Shaun of the Dead in the Blu-Ray player as Rachel had claimed to never had seen the masterpiece of a film before, and we played a few quick rounds of catch with Rowdy in the backyard. 



Once the pizza was ready, we sat down on the living room couch as we ate our shares of the mostly edible pie and laughed at the movie, as well as each other's weed induced pieces of commentary, and it wasn't long before the film came to an end.



We sat their in silence for a few moments, both lost in our high thoughts it would seem, before I spoke up. ""Want to watch Hot Fuzz next?"" I asked.



I turned to face her, but she was staring off into the distance, still thinking about something deeply.



Then, with a quick snap of her head, she turned her piercing green-eyed gaze to me, the whites of her eyes now mildly bloodshot. ""Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"" She asked.



I laughed inappropriately, imagining that she just randomly decided to start roleplaying that we were in a job interview due to my inebriated state of mind. But as the laughter calmed, I apologized, explained, and then took her question seriously.



""Honestly? Right here,"" I said. ""I want to be right here with you and Rowdy. Fishing for work. I don't know..."" I trailed off then, unsure of what she wanted to hear.



""No, be serious,"" she urged.



""I am,"" I replied. ""This life is peaceful. After Afghanistan, I didn't know if I'd ever get that again. A peaceful, simple life. It's what I needed. What I wanted.""



Rachel held Rowdy's head in her lap as she listened, massaging her fingers through his short brindle colored fur.



""I guess I want to make more money, maybe work out of a boat of my own. But other than that, things are going pretty great.""



""I don't think that boat of yours will be able to haul in enough Pike to make a living, if I'm being honest,"" she said with a devious smile, referring to the little rowboat I had purchased shortly after moving here and now left beached in a small, secluded part of the cove. I'd often take it out with Rowdy, or Rachel, or both to enjoy some calm and quiet out on the water, smoke a joint, drink a few beers, watch the sunrise or sunset, maybe do a little recreational fishing.



""No,"" I laughed. ""But seriously. Maybe I could finance a boat of my own. There's plenty of Pike and mouths to feed to go around. I'm sure the Captain wouldn't mind. I could even sell out of town. It would be a hassle, but the better pay would account for that, I'm sure. Or maybe, I could buy the Helmsman off him if he ever decides to retire. Though I doubt he'd do so, unless it got to the point where he physically couldn't do the job anymore. I'm happy with this life, though. I want this life.""



Rachel smiled at that, leaning her head into my chest and snuggling it into me.



""What about you?"" I asked. ""Where do you see yourself in 5 years?""



She opened her eyes to look up to me, her gaze full of emotion. ""Right here, with you,"" she said.



I smiled at that.



""Kiss me,"" She instructed, and I gladly obliged, leaning down and passionately interlocking our lips as I brought my hand up under her head, running my fingers through her hair and gently caressing the back of her scalp. That kiss turned into a full on make out session, which led us into the shower, which led us into bed, which then led into me waking up the following morning, our naked bodies interlocked, and I looked down with a smile at the peaceful and resting features of the woman I loved.



I hadn't realized it was what had awoken me at first, as all my attention from the moment my eyes opened had been on Rachel, but I could now hear someone banging on my front door, not furiously, but hard and consistent enough to imply some urgency.



I noticed then that Rowdy wasn't in his dog bed on the floor of my room, but was now out in the living room, barking at the front door.



Rachel stirred and groaned, clearly still too tired to start her day, and I disconnected our bodies before maneuvering myself off the bed and making my way to my closet.



I quickly pulled on a pair of boxers, a pair of jeans, and then slipped a camo Realtree long sleeve on over my head before stepping out of my room, closing the door behind me as Rachel was laying naked within. ""Quiet,"" I instructed Rowdy, and he immediately went silent, demonstrating the well-trained dog that he was. I then gave him some quick pets to assure him that he was right to alert me that someone was here, even though I wanted him to stop alerting now. I led him back into my room then, shutting him in with Rachel before proceeding to answer the door.



Whoever it was, mildly banged on the front door again.



""I'm coming!"" I called out. ""Jesus Christ, who bangs on someone's door at the 6:30 in the morning,"" I commented as I caught sight of the time on my microwave oven as I passed by the kitchen. ""This better be a fucking emergency.""



Looking through the peephole, I immediately realized that my house caller was Captain Burke. The burly man stood with his back to the door, wearing a red and brown checkered flannel, but I could make him out by his build, grey buzzcut, and the bushy grey beard that grew out around his face, too big to be obscured even by his large dome of a head. 



It was strange that he would be showing up here on our day off, but it wasn't unheard of, as there had been a few times where he'd had to come get me to help with some repair on the Helmsman or some such in order to make sure it was sea-ready by Monday morning. Or times when the Market was too stocked with fish to purchase more, and he needed someone to make a run with him out of town to sell the fish to markets of neighboring towns hours away while they were still fresh.



I sighed, unlocking the door and beginning to pull it open, realizing that the day I had planned of lying in bed with Rachel, having sex, watching comedy movies, drinking beers, smoking joints, and playing fetch with Rowdy, was now to be replaced with yet another day of work. 



""Mornin' Cap'n,"" I said as I finished pulling open the door. 



""Green Gill,"" Captain Burke replied, his back still turned to me. ""I need your help wish shomething, it shouldn't take long."" He was slurring his words a bit, as if he had been up all night drinking.



*I knew it.* ""Alright,"" I sighed. ""Just let me grab my coat and some gloves, say goodbye to Rachel."" At least if he was right about whatever it was not taking long, I could maybe make it back in time to still spend the day with her.



I turned to step away then, when some sort of primitive survival instinct compelled me not to turn my back to the Captain. ""Just don't forget to listen when the world speaks to you,"" Kajak's words echoed through my mind, and I knew my instincts were right in that moment. Something was off. Something was wrong with Captain Burke.



I turned back, keeping my eyes trained on him. Every other time he had shown up on my day off asking something of me, he showed up with coffee, doughnuts, and an apology, promising double pay for the day. Then there was his speech, Captain Burke enjoyed his drink just like any man, but he wasn't one to stay up until sunrise drinking like some college kid, especially if he knew there was work to be done the following day. Also, there was the fact that I'd never seen Captain Burke refuse to look another man in the eye as he spoke to him, that was just not something his character would allow for. And lastly, as I cautiously watched him now, I could see that his body was sporadically twitching, though he seemed to be fighting against the urge, and I could even hear low guttural noises coming from his mouth, sounds and movements that I had never seen or heard him make before.



I took a step back toward the door, readying to slam it shut if the need arose. ""Captain Burke, why won't you look me in the eye?"" I asked.



A muffled chuckle escaped the Captain then. ""Quit meshing around, Green Gill,"" He slurred back. ""We have work to do, you're burning daylight.""



I hoped I was wrong, that I was just being paranoid because of Kajak's words yesterday and perhaps some lingering effects from the plethora of weed I had smoked the night before, but I needed to know before I took one step out this door with Burke. ""Captain, look at me,"" I urged.



""Who do you think you're giving ordersh to, boy?"" Captain Burke snapped back angrily.



""Burke, turn around.""



""Are you out of your-""



""Turn around.""



""You're about to be-""



""Look at me!""



An inhuman screech shrieked through the air then, as Burke turned, thrusting a white blur in the direction of my face.



I reflexively pulled my head out of the way and caught Burkes burly arm in such a way that I had control of his wrist and elbow, to apply pressure, or even break the limb if need be.



As our movement slowed, I saw just what it was Burke had thrust at my face, as one of the tongue-stealing Isopods wriggled about in his grip, staring back at me with beady, soulless, black eyes, its legs reaching out for me, its mouth opening to let out a little scream of its own.



""What the fuck!?"" I turned back to face Burke then, seeing what had become of my noble Captain. An even larger Isopod resided in his mouth, in place of where his tongue should be. It held his jaws pried open with its limbs, allowing a steady flow of bloody drool to trail down out of the corners of Burke's mouth and into his beard, crusting the grey hairs red. The Captain's eyes now dangled out of his face, hanging past his cheeks by bloody cords, their sockets crying tears of blood, and in their place, eye stalks like that of a slug or snail rose up out from them, their alien movements putting on a terrifying display.



I screamed in horror, immediately bending the Captain's arm in a painful manner, gaining myself a dominant position, and then I threw him out of my front doorway with all my strength, watching as he flipped over himself, and painfully tumbled down the set of stairs leading up to my little front porch.



I could see more people approaching the house now, the nearest being Arturo, only, I didn't know if they were really people anymore. As where Arturo's eyes should be placed within their sockets, they instead dangled out in front of his face, and two eye stalks stretched up out of them in their place.



I slammed my front door and locked it, hearing Rowdy beginning to stir now, letting out little yipping barks as his claws scraped across the hardwood flooring of my room.



I reached my bedroom door and opened it just as Rachel had reached it from the other side, having seemed to have awoken and already put on some clothing while I was dealing with Burke.



""What's going on?"" She asked.



I pushed her back into the room, forcing my way inside as well, and then I closed and locked my bedroom door behind us.



I immediately moved to my closet then, grabbing my Army green Kevlar vest from where it hung and throwing it on over my torso, plates already aligned within, and my KA-BAR already sheathed to its chest. 



""Tyler? What the hell is happening right now?"" Rachel asked again.



I strapped my sidearm holster to my right leg, and then opened my nightstand, pulling out my handgun lockbox and placing it onto the bed.



Rachel grew frustrated at my lack of reply, moving for the bedroom door.



""No!"" I stopped her, grabbing her wrist.



""Tyler! What the hell is going on!? Are you having some sort of psychotic break right now or something!? You're putting on your gear like you're back in Afghanistan! You're scaring me! Say something!"" 



I nodded, taking a deep breath. ""I'm not going crazy, even though what I'm about to tell you is going to sound crazy. But you need to trust me and listen to me, because we are in danger right now and we need to move, okay?""



She nodded, her eyes filling with involuntary tears.



Banging started sounding out from the front door once again, though this time, it was much more forceful, as if Burke was now attempting to break it down.



Rachel jumped, turning her gaze toward the bedroom door briefly and then back to me to hear my explanation.



I moved back to my handgun case as I spoke, unlocking it. ""There was something infesting the fish yesterday, an Isopod, the Captain called it. That's why I didn't want you to buy fish for dinner, remember? I don't know how, or why, but it is infesting people now, taking them over.""



""What?"" Rachel forced out a fake laugh in disbelief. 



I retrieved my black Springfield XD Tactical .45 from the case, slapped one of the magazines home, chambered a round, then holstered my sidearm before also slotting the two spare magazines in the case into the holster as well. ""I don't know how to explain what's happening, or how to make sense of it, but it is happening. Whatever that creature is, it was in Burke's mouth, controlling him. It pushed his eyes out of his fucking head for Christ's sake, and it was using his speech to try and trick me. It forced him to attack me. The worst part, is that he was trying to force one of those things into my mouth as well, to make me like him, to turn me into one of them."" I rambled all of this off as quickly as I could, knowing that there was little to no time to catch her up, and to get her to trust me.



Rachel backed away from me now, keeping her eyes cautiously trained on my holstered sidearm. ""Tyler... I want to leave,"" she said.



""No,"" I begged. ""Please, you have to believe me. I know this sounds crazy, but it's the truth. Just trust me for the next minute, and if you don't see what I see, then walk away and call Sheriff Dunn on me, okay?""



Rachel nodded, forcing down a lump in her throat. She was clearly terrified that I was losing my mind, and having some sort of PTSD mental breakdown, but she trusted me enough to give me a chance to prove that wasn't the case.



Glass shattered then, from somewhere within the house, causing Rachel and I to both jump.



I listened closely for a moment then, hearing footfalls as someone entered the house from whatever window they had just broken.



I looked to Rachel with terror and concern. ""They're inside,"" was all I said. I grabbed my walkie talkie from my nightstand, using the clip on the back to strap it to the front of my vest, realizing as I did so, that she had left hers out in the living room inside of her purse, and that it was out of our reach now. I then took her by the hand and pulled her toward my bedroom window.



I let go of her, unlocked the window, and pulled it up and open. I then stuck my head outside, looking back and forth and all around, seeing that my backyard and the visible areas around it were clear, for now at least. ""It's clear, go,"" I instructed, gently pushing Rachel toward the window.



""You want me to crawl out your window?"" She asked, still not fully grasping our situation in her confused and freshly awoken state.



""Rachel,"" I said sternly. ""This is life or death. Move.""



She met my gaze, seeing how serious I was, and nodded, turning to crawl her way out through the window.



As she got her footing outside, I turned to Rowdy, pointed to him, and then pointed out the window. ""Through!"" I commanded, and he didn't hesitate to gracefully leap through the window, landing gently in my backyard. I then clicked my tongue and snapped my fingers to draw his attention back to me. I then pointed to him, and then to Rachel. ""Guard!"" I instructed, and he immediately got to work, stalking around Rachel and eyeing his surroundings, emanating a low warning growl to any that would dare attack her.



I moved back to my closet now, knowing there was one more thing I would need if we were to stand a fighting chance. I owned several guns, and had plenty of spare ammunition, but there wasn't enough time to grab it all. I knew that I needed to not get greedy, and that expedient movement would be the main key to my survival here. But I feared my sidearm wouldn't be enough alone to protect us from whatever was going on.



I grabbed the tan case that housed my AR-15 from the closet and hefted it up onto my bed, getting to work on putting in the combination to unlock it just as someone or something slammed into my bedroom door from the other side and began furiously banging against it. I unlocked the case, pulled the rifle up out of it, and then slammed a magazine home in the well, chambering a round just before the wood of my bedroom door shattered inward, and the door itself was wrenched off its hinges.



A shrieking cry sounded out as Arturo flung himself through my bedroom doorway and in my direction.



I pulled up my rifle at the last second, wedging it between us, and squeezed the trigger twice, punching two rounds into the dead center of his chest and propelling him back. 



We both froze for a moment, and then the Louse in his mouth let out another shriek, and he launched himself forward again, as if the fatal wounds didn't even phase him.



I pulled the barrel of the rifle up then and popped off a round just before he reached me, bursting apart the Louse within his mouth and painting the bedroom wall and doorframe with Arturo's blood and brain matter.



His form flung back from the force of the gunshot and then crumpled to the floor like a sack of bricks, but Burke replaced him in an instant, grabbing ahold of the barrel of my rifle before I could get a shot off on him, and shoving it to the side, causing me to fire a round needlessly into the wall.



He used his superior strength then from a lifetime of hard manual labor to wrench the rifle from my hands before thrusting the butt of it back into my Kevlar vest and forcing me back onto my bed. 



I thought, for less than a second, about drawing my sidearm and fighting for the rifle, but the other infested townsfolk that had made their way into my house and were now nearing the doorframe of my bedroom caused me to think better of it.



It was time to retreat.



I rolled back over my bed, falling to my hands and knees on the hardwood floor, and then launched myself through the open window, landing with my weight into my shoulder on the cold hardened ground of my backyard and using my momentum to roll with the impact, managing to quickly get to my feet.



""Tyler!"" Rachel screamed in terror, clearly having seen some of what had just went down through the window.



""Go! Go! Move!"" I urged, pushing her forward, covering her with my vest protected torso as Rowdy followed along behind us.



Gunshots cracked off behind me now, whizzing past us, and I continued using my body to cover Rachel's as we made our way to the side gate of my backyard.



A burning sting traced along the inside of my left arm, causing me to wince. Then a round full on impacted with the left side of my lower back, hitting home with my Kevlar vest, the impact nearly toppling me forward as the air was punched out of my lungs, and I gasped.



""Tyler!?"" Rachel cried out.



""Go!"" I managed to gasp out, wincing and wheezing in pain as we moved, hoping against all hope that the bullet hadn't managed to get through my vest.



We reached the gate, and I allowed myself to fall into it for a moment to catch my breath as Rachel unlatched it and pushed it open.



""Come on,"" she said, taking me by the arm and pulling me through as I groaned in pain, leading me out onto a street filled with infested townsfolk that I once called neighbors. But I knew their minds were gone, replaced by the will of the Isopods that had stolen their tongues, now overcome with the urge to hunt down and assimilate everyone they once knew.",1,1745142875.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

I hadn‚Äôt thought about that week in years.  
Not until I started cleaning out¬†*His*¬†garage.

This place still smelled like motor oil and sawdust. The old fluorescent light buzzed overhead, flickering every few seconds like it was trying to remind me that time doesn‚Äôt move the same in places like this.¬†

I found a half-finished workbench in the corner, dust settled over it like snow. The same one Dad said he‚Äôd finally finish ""when he had the time.""

He never did.¬†

Even with the windows cracked and the door rolled halfway open, the air clung to me‚Äîsawdust, WD-40, old sweat and rusted metal. The kind of smell that sinks into your skin. I stood there for a while just breathing it in, like it might fill the hole in my chest.

He was gone.

Three weeks ago, the cancer finally won.

It wasn‚Äôt sudden. We‚Äôd known for months‚Äîmaybe longer, if I‚Äôm honest with myself.¬†

But even when the chemo started thinning his hair and turning his skin that gray-yellow color, Dad never wanted to talk about it.  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a bump in the road,‚Äù he‚Äôd said.  
He meant it.

He still worked in here up until the last two months, dragging himself out of bed with a thermos full of black coffee and a stubborn glint in his eye. I‚Äôd tell him to rest. He‚Äôd grunt something like, ‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôve still got a few good licks in me,‚Äù and then he‚Äôd go tinkering with something that didn‚Äôt need fixing just to prove he still could.

I used to sit on that upside-down milk crate and watch him work. We'd listen to the radio, WLIK on low, playing some twangy acoustic stuff that I hated as a kid and miss now like hell.

He didn't say much. Never did. But when I‚Äôd hand him a socket wrench without being asked, he‚Äôd nod like it meant something. Like maybe he was proud of me in his quiet way.

I think about that more now. All the things he said with gestures. The way he'd pat my back when he passed by. He wasn‚Äôt a perfect dad. Not by a long shot. He yelled when he got overwhelmed. Shut down when he didn‚Äôt know how to help. Hell, when I came out as gay, he just nodded and flicked the tv channel over to Will and Grace.¬†

He never really knew what to do with feelings‚Äîhis or mine.

But he showed up. Every time.

Even when I didn‚Äôt deserve it.

And now...  
Now I‚Äôm standing in the middle of his garage with my childhood in one hand and nothing but silence in the other.

¬†I‚Äôd come home to clean the place out‚Äîafter the funeral, after the casseroles, after the endless parade of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry‚Äù from people who didn‚Äôt know him, not really.¬†

I knew Mom and¬†Tori couldn‚Äôt deal with it.¬†

I was going through his old toolbox when I found it: my¬†*Space Jam*¬†blanket, folded neatly in the bottom of a milk crate, sun-faded and worn thin at the corners the blood stains soaked into the fabric and turned slightly brown with age. It was tucked beneath a tangle of orange extension cords and a cracked Thermos. I don‚Äôt know why he kept it. Maybe he forgot it was even there.

But the second I saw it... I swear I felt twelve again  
and then that whole week came back‚Ä¶¬†

The one we never told anyone about.The one I thought I‚Äôd imagined until now.

***2003***

*MONDAY*

Monday morning, I woke up to the sound of birds tapping on the gutters and the muffled slam of a screen door somewhere down the street. April sun was slipping in through the blinds in soft golden stripes. I reached for the alarm clock, blinking at the numbers.

7:04AM.

School started in exactly twenty-six minutes.¬†

I rolled back over and coughed‚Äîdry, flat, fake.¬†

But I‚Äôd been rehearsing all weekend. Practicing in the mirror, rasping like I had strep, even holding the thermometer to the light bulb for a second too long before chickening out and shaking it back down.

I wasn‚Äôt sick.  
Not in the way my dad would understand.

I just... couldn‚Äôt go back.  
Not to the jokes.  
Not to Luke Bennett and his sharp elbows and sharper laugh.  
Not after what he whispered in gym class last Friday in front of everyone.

The door cracked open, and Mom peeked her head in. Her face lit up when she saw I was awake.  
‚ÄúHey, sweetie.‚Äù  
Her voice was soft and singsongy, like she used when I was sick for real. ‚ÄúYou feel any better this morning?‚Äù

I shook my head dramatically and gave a weak little sniff. ‚ÄúNot really‚Ä¶‚Äù

She crossed the room and sat on the edge of the bed, brushing my bangs off my forehead. Her fingers were cool and gentle. I remember she was still in her bathrobe, the pink one with little blue flowers.

‚ÄúYou feel warm,‚Äù she said, though I was pretty sure I didn‚Äôt.

I didn‚Äôt say anything. I just gave her the most pitiful look I could manage.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she smiled, smoothing the blanket. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go talk to your dad, let him know you‚Äôre still sick and see what he says.‚Äù

She kissed my forehead and stood up, but before she reached the door, my older sister‚Äôs voice floated in‚Äîsarcastic and smug.

‚ÄúFake,‚Äù she said, peeking her head around the corner with a smirk. She was already dressed for school, backpack over one shoulder, highlighted hair pulled into a sloppy ponytail.

‚ÄúShut up, Tori,‚Äù I muttered, keeping my voice low so Mom wouldn‚Äôt hear.

‚ÄúYou better hope you‚Äôre actually faking it. Because if I catch the plague from you, I‚Äôll kill you myself.‚Äù

I flipped her off.

She raised her eyebrows like she was gonna rat me out‚Äîbut she didn‚Äôt. She just snorted and walked off, calling over her shoulder, ‚ÄúEnjoy your sick day, loser.‚Äù

Mom didn‚Äôt notice. Or pretended not to. She just shook her head,¬†

‚ÄúLeave your brother alone, Victoria.‚Äù¬†

Mom walked away muttering something about the two of us being impossible and padded down the hall toward the kitchen.

After a few minutes I heard Dad's boots thud down the hall before he knocked twice on my door‚Äîhe always knocked, even if he was already turning the handle.

My head wasn‚Äôt hot. My throat wasn‚Äôt sore. But I still pulled the covers up to my chin and added a few dry coughs for effect.¬†

I‚Äôd practiced them the night before.

¬†‚ÄúHey, you good buddy?‚Äù

I coughed again, this time with a little throat rasp. ‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt feel good.‚Äù

He stepped in. His dark work shirt was already tucked into his jeans, sleeves rolled up, the familiar¬†‚Äú*Dale‚Äù*¬†patch stitched over his chest.¬†

His hair was still wet from his shower, and he smelled like Irish Spring.

He crossed the room in two strides and laid a calloused hand on my forehead. His fingers smelled like engine oil

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt feel like a fever,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre pale.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything. Just looked up at him from the nest of blankets. The morning sun hit the side of his face, and for a second, I thought he looked tired. Not the kind of tired a nap would fix. The kind that just builds and builds until it lives in your bones.

He didn't press it. He never did when it came to me being sick. I think after my surgery, he started to believe I was made of glass.¬†

When I was 5 years old, I had a brain tumor, it was removed though and I was fine, but it scared the hell out of him and mom.¬†¬†

‚ÄúJust rest, okay?‚Äù he said, already halfway out the door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna work in the garage most of the day. You need anything, come get me.‚Äù¬†

He turned back toward the door, then paused. ‚ÄúYou want anything? Waffles? Cereal?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe toast.‚Äù

‚ÄúComing right up.‚Äù

He left without another word, humming something low and tuneless. I waited until I heard the faint clink of a toaster lever and the sound of the garage door creaking open before I climbed out of bed.

I spent the first couple hours exactly how I imagined: sprawled on the carpet, watching¬†*The Amanda Show*¬†on my old Zenith box TV, sipping Capri Sun through a chewed-up straw. My feet were cold. I didn‚Äôt mind.

The house felt... calm. Like it exhaled once the world left for work and school. I knew every sound it made. The way the fridge clicked when it kicked on. The creak of the hallway when you stepped just right. The faint¬†*clunk*¬†of the dryer vent in the wind.

But around 11AM, something was off.

I was halfway through a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, flipping through an old¬†*Nintendo Power*, when I heard a thump.

Not from outside. Not from the garage.

From the hallway.

Just one. A soft thud, like a dropped shoe or someone stumbling. Then nothing.

I muted the TV and listened.

Silence.

I tried to laugh it off, but something in my chest pulled tight. The air suddenly felt heavy, like when a storm's about to roll in.

I crept to the hallway and peeked down it. Every door was shut... except the closet. The one by the bathroom. Its door stood cracked open just an inch‚Äîjust enough to show darkness inside.

I hadn‚Äôt opened it. I was sure of it.

I stood there for a long time, heart punching the inside of my ribs. Then I grabbed the broom from the laundry room and‚Äîlike an idiot‚Äîpoked it shut from a distance.

*Click.*

I exhaled.

Later that afternoon, I asked Dad if he‚Äôd opened it earlier. He looked up from the engine he was working on, grease on his fingers and forehead.

‚ÄúWhat closet?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe hallway one. By the bathroom.‚Äù

He shook his head, wiping sweat off his brow with the back of his arm. ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt been inside the house all day.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt say anything else. I think he chalked it up to imagination. Or nerves. Or both.

That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep.

The ceiling fan rattled gently overhead, and the streetlamp outside my window painted familiar shadows on the wall. I pulled the blanket up to my chin and counted the blinking red numbers on my clock.

2:13AM.

I was just starting to drift off when I heard it.

A low hum. Not a sound I recognized. Not the fridge. Not the fan. Not the vent. It was inside the wall. Soft and vibrating, like a voice pressed through insulation.

Then... something moved across the ceiling.

Not a shadow.  
Not a trick of light.

Something that didn‚Äôt belong. Something crawling, but too smooth. Too slow. It passed just above me like a ripple in the plaster, just long enough for my breath to catch in my throat.

I didn‚Äôt scream. I didn‚Äôt move. I just laid there, every part of me rigid, listening to the silence that followed.

I didn‚Äôt know it then‚Äîbut that was only the beginning.

NOW

I shuttered the memory away and pulled out my phone to write this just so I didn't forget.

I tucked the blanket into my jeep and decided to drive home for the night. I have to come back to do more work in the garage and it's already so late...

I don‚Äôt remember much of my childhood but the parts I do remember I wish I could forget.¬†

I hadn‚Äôt thought about that week in years.  
Not until I started cleaning out¬†*His*¬†garage.

This place still smelled like motor oil and sawdust. The old fluorescent light buzzed overhead, flickering every few seconds like it was trying to remind me that time doesn‚Äôt move the same in places like this.¬†

I found a half-finished workbench in the corner, dust settled over it like snow. The same one Dad said he‚Äôd finally finish ""when he had the time.""

He never did.¬†

Even with the windows cracked and the door rolled halfway open, the air clung to me‚Äîsawdust, WD-40, old sweat and rusted metal. The kind of smell that sinks into your skin. I stood there for a while just breathing it in, like it might fill the hole in my chest.

He was gone.

Three weeks ago, the cancer finally won.

It wasn‚Äôt sudden. We‚Äôd known for months‚Äîmaybe longer, if I‚Äôm honest with myself.¬†

But even when the chemo started thinning his hair and turning his skin that gray-yellow color, Dad never wanted to talk about it.  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a bump in the road,‚Äù he‚Äôd said.  
He meant it.

He still worked in here up until the last two months, dragging himself out of bed with a thermos full of black coffee and a stubborn glint in his eye. I‚Äôd tell him to rest. He‚Äôd grunt something like, ‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôve still got a few good licks in me,‚Äù and then he‚Äôd go tinkering with something that didn‚Äôt need fixing just to prove he still could.

I used to sit on that upside-down milk crate and watch him work. We'd listen to the radio, WLIK on low, playing some twangy acoustic stuff that I hated as a kid and miss now like hell.

He didn't say much. Never did. But when I‚Äôd hand him a socket wrench without being asked, he‚Äôd nod like it meant something. Like maybe he was proud of me in his quiet way.

I think about that more now. All the things he said with gestures. The way he'd pat my back when he passed by. He wasn‚Äôt a perfect dad. Not by a long shot. He yelled when he got overwhelmed. Shut down when he didn‚Äôt know how to help. Hell, when I came out as gay, he just nodded and flicked the tv channel over to Will and Grace.¬†

He never really knew what to do with feelings‚Äîhis or mine.

But he showed up. Every time.

Even when I didn‚Äôt deserve it.

And now...  
Now I‚Äôm standing in the middle of his garage with my childhood in one hand and nothing but silence in the other.

¬†I‚Äôd come home to clean the place out‚Äîafter the funeral, after the casseroles, after the endless parade of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry‚Äù from people who didn‚Äôt know him, not really.¬†

I knew Mom and¬†Tori couldn‚Äôt deal with it.¬†

I was going through his old toolbox when I found it: my¬†*Space Jam*¬†blanket, folded neatly in the bottom of a milk crate, sun-faded and worn thin at the corners the blood stains soaked into the fabric and turned slightly brown with age. It was tucked beneath a tangle of orange extension cords and a cracked Thermos. I don‚Äôt know why he kept it. Maybe he forgot it was even there.

But the second I saw it... I swear I felt twelve again  
and then that whole week came back‚Ä¶¬†

The one we never told anyone about.The one I thought I‚Äôd imagined until now.  
  
***2003***

*MONDAY*

Monday morning, I woke up to the sound of birds tapping on the gutters and the muffled slam of a screen door somewhere down the street. April sun was slipping in through the blinds in soft golden stripes. I reached for the alarm clock, blinking at the numbers.

7:04AM.

School started in exactly twenty-six minutes.¬†

I rolled back over and coughed‚Äîdry, flat, fake.¬†

But I‚Äôd been rehearsing all weekend. Practicing in the mirror, rasping like I had strep, even holding the thermometer to the light bulb for a second too long before chickening out and shaking it back down.

I wasn‚Äôt sick.  
Not in the way my dad would understand.

I just... couldn‚Äôt go back.  
Not to the jokes.  
Not to Luke Bennett and his sharp elbows and sharper laugh.  
Not after what he whispered in gym class last Friday in front of everyone.

The door cracked open, and Mom peeked her head in. Her face lit up when she saw I was awake.  
‚ÄúHey, sweetie.‚Äù  
Her voice was soft and singsongy, like she used when I was sick for real. ‚ÄúYou feel any better this morning?‚Äù

I shook my head dramatically and gave a weak little sniff. ‚ÄúNot really‚Ä¶‚Äù

She crossed the room and sat on the edge of the bed, brushing my bangs off my forehead. Her fingers were cool and gentle. I remember she was still in her bathrobe, the pink one with little blue flowers.

  
‚ÄúYou feel warm,‚Äù she said, though I was pretty sure I didn‚Äôt.

I didn‚Äôt say anything. I just gave her the most pitiful look I could manage.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she smiled, smoothing the blanket. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go talk to your dad, let him know you‚Äôre still sick and see what he says.‚Äù

She kissed my forehead and stood up, but before she reached the door, my older sister‚Äôs voice floated in‚Äîsarcastic and smug.

‚ÄúFake,‚Äù she said, peeking her head around the corner with a smirk. She was already dressed for school, backpack over one shoulder, highlighted hair pulled into a sloppy ponytail.

‚ÄúShut up, Tori,‚Äù I muttered, keeping my voice low so Mom wouldn‚Äôt hear.

‚ÄúYou better hope you‚Äôre actually faking it. Because if I catch the plague from you, I‚Äôll kill you myself.‚Äù

I flipped her off.

She raised her eyebrows like she was gonna rat me out‚Äîbut she didn‚Äôt. She just snorted and walked off, calling over her shoulder, ‚ÄúEnjoy your sick day, loser.‚Äù

Mom didn‚Äôt notice. Or pretended not to. She just shook her head,¬†

‚ÄúLeave your brother alone, Victoria.‚Äù¬†

Mom walked away muttering something about the two of us being impossible and padded down the hall toward the kitchen.

After a few minutes I heard Dad's boots thud down the hall before he knocked twice on my door‚Äîhe always knocked, even if he was already turning the handle.

My head wasn‚Äôt hot. My throat wasn‚Äôt sore. But I still pulled the covers up to my chin and added a few dry coughs for effect.¬†

I‚Äôd practiced them the night before.

¬†‚ÄúHey, you good buddy?‚Äù

I coughed again, this time with a little throat rasp. ‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt feel good.‚Äù

He stepped in. His dark work shirt was already tucked into his jeans, sleeves rolled up, the familiar¬†‚Äú*Dale‚Äù*¬†patch stitched over his chest.¬†

His hair was still wet from his shower, and he smelled like Irish Spring.

He crossed the room in two strides and laid a calloused hand on my forehead. His fingers smelled like engine oil

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt feel like a fever,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre pale.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything. Just looked up at him from the nest of blankets. The morning sun hit the side of his face, and for a second, I thought he looked tired. Not the kind of tired a nap would fix. The kind that just builds and builds until it lives in your bones.

He didn't press it. He never did when it came to me being sick. I think after my surgery, he started to believe I was made of glass.¬†

When I was 5 years old, I had a brain tumor, it was removed though and I was fine, but it scared the hell out of him and mom.¬†¬†

  
‚ÄúJust rest, okay?‚Äù he said, already halfway out the door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna work in the garage most of the day. You need anything, come get me.‚Äù¬†

He turned back toward the door, then paused. ‚ÄúYou want anything? Waffles? Cereal?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe toast.‚Äù

‚ÄúComing right up.‚Äù

He left without another word, humming something low and tuneless. I waited until I heard the faint clink of a toaster lever and the sound of the garage door creaking open before I climbed out of bed.

I spent the first couple hours exactly how I imagined: sprawled on the carpet, watching¬†*The Amanda Show*¬†on my old Zenith box TV, sipping Capri Sun through a chewed-up straw. My feet were cold. I didn‚Äôt mind.

The house felt... calm. Like it exhaled once the world left for work and school. I knew every sound it made. The way the fridge clicked when it kicked on. The creak of the hallway when you stepped just right. The faint¬†*clunk*¬†of the dryer vent in the wind.

But around 11AM, something was off.

I was halfway through a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, flipping through an old¬†*Nintendo Power*, when I heard a thump.

Not from outside. Not from the garage.

From the hallway.

Just one. A soft thud, like a dropped shoe or someone stumbling. Then nothing.

I muted the TV and listened.

Silence.

I tried to laugh it off, but something in my chest pulled tight. The air suddenly felt heavy, like when a storm's about to roll in.

I crept to the hallway and peeked down it. Every door was shut... except the closet. The one by the bathroom. Its door stood cracked open just an inch‚Äîjust enough to show darkness inside.

I told my partner yesterday that during one date with a woman I met before her, I just stood up in silence, paid my coffee and left. This left her kind of baffled and she said that was shitty behavior.

The background is: the woman I went on a date with was suggested to me by a friend. She knew that I was very into music and the arts in general and so she suggested somebody I could meet who is into the same stuff. I actually did meet her at a party beforehand and she seemed perfectly nice, so I agreed to meet her.

During the date we talked about general life stuff at first. I told her that I was interested in artistic things too and tried to get the conversation going. When I described what I liked about certain things, I never got any follow-up questions or comments or even acknowledgements that she doesn't know what I'm talking about. It was always ""ok"", ""aha"" or ""mh"".

At some point I've had enough and I just stood up, paid and left.

The thing is - my current partner of 12 years was the exact opposite of that! That's why we got together and I would have never done it with her or somebody who seemed at least a little bit interested.

Recently my wife (24M) has been complaining about how little I do at home, saying how tired she is and how much she does for me that I don't realize, naturally I asked how I could help.

**Education**
Bachelors in IT

**Career**
Software Engineer in Finance. Pivoting to the health-tech (fingers-crossed)

**Background**
Born and raised in Lahore. Moved to Sydney when I was 20, been living here ever since. My family is back in Lahore. We are Punjabi and if you‚Äôre curious about my caste; please be reminded castes are just desi fan fiction.

**Height**
5‚Äô7

**Marital status**
Single

**Location**
Sydney, Australia

**Religion**
Practicing Sunni

**Disclaimer**
I will prefer women who are already living in Australia, or are interested in relocating.

**How do I view myself?**
I am both artistic and technical. One moment I can be nerding about some esoteric technology and the next planning my visit to some art gallery. I love coffee and am currently reading a book about coffee. However, you can continue being a chai person if that‚Äôs your persuasion. I am soft-spoken, rarely raise my voice, deeply care about my ‚Äòaap‚Äôs and ‚Äòtu‚Äôs. 

Islamically speaking, I was raised a Sunni. I have deep reverence and respect for all sects. I do believe that some of my views differ from the mainstream (can talk about it in dms). I listen to a wide array of scholars and teachings. I do believe in the fundamentals however I need to work on being more practicing. Alcohol, narcotics, drugs, vapes are deal-breakers for me. Also people who do not respect other faiths and walks of life give me the ick.

I am progressive in some respect. I like to examine my beliefs, biases and ideas. Open to having my mind changed for anything. I am not rigid in my ways or a stubborn person. I believe in making mistakes and learning from them. Trial and error. 

That being said, I am traditional in some ways. I have a provider mindset; It would be love, honour and privilege for me to provide for my wife and family. 

I care about myself. I invest in myself. Go to the gym, read and sit down for soulful conversations. I leave my ego at the door and I would expect my partner to do the same.

**How do I spend my time?**
When I am not working, you can catch me hiking, running or programming. I love cycling as well. Love the occasional binge or reclusiveness into a vegetative state. I would be happy to join my partner in their endeavours, hobbies or just bask in their presence.

**How do I want my partner to be?**
I want someone who is ambitious, supportive, has their own dreams and aspirations. I want to support her in her journey. I want her to be affectionate and loving. I would want her to be emotionally intelligent and fun to talk to. I will prefer her to be religiously moderate.

Start it off me and my partner are looking at buying our first house (which is a very stressful experience) 
We were going to go do an inspection of a property, I was a bit tired so I had an iced coffee (not normally a coffee drinker) but I drink caffeine normally. 
Now the panic started before we even left (45min drive) but I put it off as I thought it was just a bit of a weird feeling. I get stomach pain initially then a lump in my throat then it spirals from there.
Got about half way and it started setting in fully. Pulled over and calmed myself down, kept going. 
3/4 way there pulled over again. It fully started to happen. Partner went to get me food and water. I wandered off into a park somewhere in order to get away from people. 
Took an hour for me to be able to get back into the car to drive home. Then it calmed down but I knew I just had to get home. Shear panic, tingling hands, felt like I was going to shit myself. Made it home eventually. Went to the bathroom and just stood there until I calmed down.

1k3iuwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheExpanse/comments/1k3iuwe/im_somewhat_disappointed_by_calibans_war/,I'm somewhat disappointed by Caliban's war,"My main gripe with it is that the story that's being told is very similar to the one already told - escalating tension between the factions, crisis on a moon in the belt, Fred sends the Rocinante to the moon in question, they find the protomolecule, follow the leads, discover the origin and take care of it. By the end of it feels like very little has changed overall in the status quo of the overall story.

It was also surprising how Holden seems to go through the same personal struggles as in the first book. Again going through that motion of suppressing his fear, turning it into anger and needing Naomi to point it out for him. Speaking of Naomi, it was baffling that no one thinks their relationship can be problematic for the crew. I mean, she did walk off the ship after their fight. I'm not saying the relationship makes it impossible for the crew to function but the fact that no one at least raises a concern over it is naive, at best.

Something else that bothered me is that Holden seems to have not remembered prior events - deciding to broadcast the discovery of the protomolecule on Ganymede without giving a moment's thought to the chaos this can cause was really stupid. Especially after the arguments he had with Miller over it. This was one of the main narrative conflicts from the first book for me and having it tossed out the window kinda sucks.

The part of Holden going aboard the Agatha King was just Eros v2. And, of course, our hero manages to save the day and barely escapes to fight another day.

What I miss the most, however, was the worldbuilding - LW did a good job of showing us what the Belt is like. We had a bit of it on Ganymede but it wasn't all that different and there wasn't really much of it. Bobby's episode in the coffee shop I really liked as it gave us a glimpse into life on Earth but, again, it was just a tiny bit.

The political games were a good addition as a backdrop to all that's going on in the system. It felt dubious at times, though. I mean, Avasarala was certain Soren is lying to her based on him biting his lip. Eh? The flip side to that was this superpower being taken away from her when she had to deal with communication over vast distances.

All that being said, I can still say that I had a good time with CW. Not as much as LW but it was still an easy and pleasant read that manages to grip you and leaves very few dull moments. I'll definitely keep going with the series but not immediately as some other books have grabbed my attention currently and a bit of break will probably feel nice.

I'd be glad to hear what you thought of the book and why I might be wrong.",5,1745141466.0,TheExpanse,2,0.73,False

 ## Key Features Analysis

The beehive cup offers several noteworthy features that contribute to its overall appeal and functionality.

**Unique Beehive Design:** The most defining feature of a beehive cup is, of course, its beehive-inspired shape. These cups often mimic the intricate hexagonal patterns found in natural beehives, adding a visually appealing and tactile element to the drinking experience.

Many variations exist, from subtle, stylized interpretations to more literal and detailed recreations of a beehive's structure. The design often incorporates elements like textured surfaces and rounded edges to enhance the overall aesthetic and ergonomic feel of the cup.

**Material Durability and Clarity:** Beehive cups are typically crafted from materials like clear glass, durable borosilicate glass, or high-quality ceramic. The choice of material affects the cup's durability, thermal resistance, and aesthetic appeal.

Clear glass allows the user to appreciate the color and texture of the beverage inside, while borosilicate glass offers superior resistance to thermal shock, making it suitable for both hot and cold drinks. Ceramic beehive cups often come in various colors and finishes, providing additional decorative options.

**Ergonomic Grip and Comfort:** The design of a beehive cup takes into consideration the ergonomics of holding and drinking. The shape, while resembling a beehive, is often carefully crafted to provide a comfortable and secure grip.

Some designs feature a slightly tapered body or strategically placed indentations to enhance the user's hold. The weight distribution is also considered to ensure that the cup feels balanced and easy to handle, even when filled with liquid.

**Capacity and Dimensions:** Beehive cups come in a range of sizes to accommodate different beverage preferences. Smaller cups may hold around 6-8 ounces, ideal for espresso or small servings of mead, while larger cups can accommodate 12-16 ounces or more for coffee, tea, or other drinks.

The dimensions of the cup, including its height and diameter, are carefully chosen to maintain visual proportions and ergonomic balance. The cup's size also influences its stability and ease of handling.

Key features of the beehive cup include:
* Unique and visually appealing beehive design
* Durable construction using glass or ceramic materials
* Ergonomic design for comfortable handling
* Versatile sizing for various beverages

 ## FAQs Section

**Are beehive cups dishwasher safe?**

Some beehive cups are dishwasher safe, but it depends on the material and construction. Glass and borosilicate glass beehive cups are typically dishwasher safe, while ceramic cups may require handwashing to prevent damage to the finish or glaze. Always check the manufacturer's instructions for specific care guidelines.

**Can beehive cups be used for hot and cold beverages?**

Yes, beehive cups made from borosilicate glass or ceramic are generally suitable for both hot and cold beverages. Borosilicate glass is particularly resistant to thermal shock, making it an excellent choice for handling extreme temperature changes. Ceramic cups can also handle a wide range of temperatures, but it's best to avoid sudden and drastic temperature shifts to prevent cracking.

**Where can I purchase authentic beehive cups?**

Authentic beehive cups can be purchased from specialty kitchenware stores, online retailers specializing in unique glassware, or directly from artisans and craftspeople who create handmade pottery or glassware. It's important to verify the source and materials used to ensure you're getting a high-quality and genuine product.

Kharghar feels like home right from 2016 days where there was very less traffic, huge roads, and some places to play FIFA and call of duty on PS4 (I‚Äôm talking about You gamers pride, close now for some years)

So the post is just a note to myself for me to process that I will be moving to Delhi soon - yet another Dad‚Äôs transfer 

I don‚Äôt know, Delhi doesn‚Äôt give me good vibes, but then maybe that‚Äôs my brain craving order and familiarity.

 My friends and I used to hang out near Crystal Plaza used to play in turfs and also used to have tea and cigarette here near the IMT Ke paas wali Tapri 

Yeah, this is just me thinking out loud on my voice to text, sipping coffee here in front of Crystal Plaza - I was a regular here - so if anyone of you is reading this, and maybe has gone through such a change where you uproot your life after having spent some of your formative years at someplace and moving to a new place with new friends and new gym and new places where you hang out please share a bit of your experience here, maybe if someone has a bit of experience with Delhi or north India 

I don‚Äôt know what I am expecting out of this post, but I‚Äôll just leave it here. A fragment of my mind to maybe remind myself and come back here after a few years, consider this a candid journal entry. 

I have always loved You, Kharghar, maybe I‚Äôll be back in a few years with my own children and family or life will take me someplace else where I‚Äôll meet someone from around here and we will  enthusiastically Discuss and bring up common like little world where we used to go post exams.

1k3iq6x,https://v.redd.it/7ied7dvqjyve1,"I smile and laugh smugly in my new position and body, as my former self sits across from me horrified seeing his old body under my control. I‚Äôm the CEO now, so what if I was old. I had everything I wanted, riches, position, authority, all at the tip of his-no-my fingers. (Story in description)","After all the years of working for Mr. Flannegan, I was beginning to grow sick of him. I had shown loyalty to him and the company in hopes of allying myself with him and being his second in command. After all I had looked up to him for so long, I‚Äôd be more than happy as second fiddle to him. 

But alas, all these years, all the loyalty, and nothing to show for it. Not so much as a penny raise from that old cheapskate. I had asked him about it and confessed my desires to run the company alongside him and he merely pushed me aside like a piece of trash. Months passed and still nothing, I tried to go even harder. Fulfilling tasks for him, doing whatever he needed done on top of my own work. All amounting to nothing. 

It hit me that he knew how desperate I was and that I would always do whatever he asked and he didn‚Äôt have to give me any reward. He‚Äôd simply use me for my labors and line his own pockets with any financial gain that came out of my work. 

And the day after this realization, it happened. As I got in bed that night, I was overcome with hatred. Wishing I could take his place more than anything in the entire world, I‚Äôd be content to leave my life behind and take his away from him as punishment, I deserve it after all. I imagine myself in his shoes, living out the life I had strived to attain for years, wishing- no, willing it to be true. Then- black. 

When I woke I felt like I had slept an eternity, so much so that I felt heavier, less mobile. Strange. So I got up to get ready for work, ‚Äúhuh that‚Äôs odd‚Äù I say looking around the u familiar room. Then I realized, that wasn‚Äôt my voice. It was Mr. Flannegans. 

I rushed to the bathroom to look in the mirror and it seems karma listened to me last night. I saw Mr. Flannegans- no, my older figure, white hair, thick mustache, and face staring back at me, making any motion I commanded it to. I stared for a second in shock, then realized that my hatred and will to take his life in exchange for my own actually worked. And I saw that trademark smug smile creep across my new face. I ran my hands down my new body before going into his- my closet, which was filled with very expensive suits, selected one, and put it on, getting ready to head to the office. I checked the mirror one last time, man I loved the look of myself in the mirror in this suit. I grabbed my keys and briefcase then headed to his car, a very expensive brand new Mercedes. As I pulled out of the driveway I got a look at my new house. It was huge! Man I really hit the jackpot huh?  

I eventually arrived at the office and took great joy in parking in the designated CEO parking space. I grabbed my things and got in the elevator to get to my office. As I walked through the hallways, I was greeted with great respect. Receiving various greetings such as ‚ÄúGood morning sir!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúMorning Mr. Flannegan.‚Äù Which made me smile, they had no idea. I used the key on the same chain as the key to my Mercedes to unlock my new office door, set my stuff down and took my seat at my desk as if I had been doing it for the last 20 years. I kicked my feet up on the desk, looked around my very large and luxurious office, and began to smile wide and laugh. ‚ÄúFinally‚Äù I say in my new voice. I looked at my reflection in the mirror on the wall of the office. Man I looked so powerful. Sitting my private office, wearing a distinguished and very expensive suit, and now with white hair and a thick mustache, which I couldn‚Äôt help but constantly stroke. I admit aging 30 years overnight isn‚Äôt the greatest, but it was well worth the sacrifice. 

I began doing my new paperwork as CEO, loving every minute of it. This company was flourishing under me and I loved it. That‚Äôs when an idea stroke me. ‚ÄúJanet?‚Äù I called to his- I mean my secretary. 

‚ÄúYes Mr. Flannegan?‚Äù 

‚ÄúCan you find Davidson (my old last name) and tell him to come to my office?‚Äù I ordered. 

‚ÄúOf course sir.‚Äù She replied

I sit up straight, fix my suit, and tighten my tie, making sure I was looking distinguished in his body before he came in. 

He walks in and is dumbstruck. I won‚Äôt lie so was I, but to uphold the look of my new body I kept it hidden. ‚ÄúSit‚Äù I commanded to him, and just like me, he did exactly as I said. 

‚ÄúWell I gotta say, this is a great life you got, thank you for handing it over so generously.‚Äù I say cockily, laughing and kicking my feet up onto his former desk. 

‚ÄúDavidson what did you do?‚Äù He spat angrily at me. Man I can see why I never got promoted, looking at myself through Mr Flannegans eyes, I- he looked unprofessional, acted childish, and didn‚Äôt deserve to sit at my side. Plus he looked nowhere as distinguished as me. 

‚ÄúWhat your tone with me Davidson, I‚Äôm the damn CEO of this company.‚Äù I shot back at him confidently, which shut him right up. ‚ÄúI made things right, this is how things should be. After all these years, I deserve this. In case you couldn‚Äôt figure it out already‚Äù I looked down at myself and brushed my hands down the face of my suit, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm you, and you‚Äôre me, forever. The company, the house, the Mercedes, your family, your suits, are all mine now.‚Äù I said smugly to him. 

The horrified look on his face was satisfying. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt take my life, my company, my family, it‚Äôs mine! That body‚Äôs mine! I‚Äôll call the cops on you!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh believe me Davidson, it‚Äôs mine. Call the cops, go ahead, do you really think they‚Äôll believe you spouting on about how you‚Äôre the real Richard Flannegan? Look at me! It‚Äôs a great body and life, I can see why you‚Äôre so upset.‚Äù I reply. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna give you two options Davidson, you can either keep fighting this, and I‚Äôll fire you, leaving you homeless in your unfamiliar life. Or you can give me the respect you ought to be giving me as your boss, and I won‚Äôt fire your sorry ass.‚Äù I told him. 

He was shaking now, but what could he do? I made the ultimate chess move. He was trapped. ‚ÄúFine, asshole.‚Äù He spat back at me

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry what was that? Do you want me to fire you?‚Äù I threatened, it felt good to use my new power. 

‚ÄúUh- Sorry sir. Yes Mr. Flannegan, that sounds fair, you deserve it. Let me know if you need anything else.‚Äù He replied coweringly. 

‚ÄúGood, you‚Äôre dismissed. Oh and Davidson, bring me a cup of coffee before you get back to work. I expect it up here in 5 minutes and your paperwork submitted to me by tomorrow.‚Äù I said to him tauntingly.

‚ÄúYes Mr. Flannegan‚Äù he replied defeatedly.

I smiled and continued to do my new work, getting distracted by a notification on my phone. It was from my new wife. 

‚ÄúHey honey, can‚Äôt wait to see you tonight. Didn‚Äôt get to say goodbye this morning, love you.‚Äù She messaged. 

I smiled ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to see you either baby. I‚Äôm sorry about this morning. I‚Äôll make it up to you tonight. I promise. üòà ‚Äú I replied back.

1k3ipv3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k3ipv3,From 0 to 150 ratings: My 4-month journey building a photo cleanup app.,"Hi everyone, I wanted to share my story of building and iterating on my iOS app: [ByePhotos](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/byephotos-clean-up-phone/id6737446757), a photo cleanup tool. It's not a successful app, but I think sharing my experience might be helpful for others.

I started this app mostly for myself. My photo library was filled with burst photos from travels, lots of random shots, and large videos I wanted to keep(so I needed an app with video compression functionality).

Initially, I tried finding apps to help clean it up, but couldn‚Äôt find one I was happy with. Most of them were way too expensive for me (like $7 a week), and their designs didn‚Äôt appeal to me either. On top of that, many were bloated with features I didn‚Äôt need ‚Äî like contact cleanup, battery optimization, charging animations, and even network speed tests (yes, really).

Here are some of the main iterations I went through:

# 1. Launch & a missed opportunity

I spent two months of spare time building the first version of this app, which initially only had similar photo detection and video compression features.

When I launched, I posted about it on Twitter(I have 2k followers), and made the lifetime license free for 3 days ‚Äî which brought in over 15,000 downloads. I think this was partly because the App Store tends to give new apps some initial exposure, and the free promotion got picked up by accounts that specialize in sharing daily app deals.

But I had a silly bug: I meant for the second review request to appear after 7 days, but accidentally delayed the first one too! I didn‚Äôt think much of it back then, but after diving into ASO later on, I realized how big of a mistake that was (since App Store rankings are heavily influenced by the number of ratings received in the past 30 days). Assuming 1 out of every 100 downloads turns into a rating, I could‚Äôve had around 150 reviews in just those first 3 days.

# 2. Low revenue, low trial-to-paid conversion

After the free promotion ended, I started getting some revenue, and that's when I realized my second mistake: the price was too low‚Äîjust $0.99/month‚Äîso my revenue stayed very low.

In addition, I used RevenueCat‚Äôs [Health Score tool](https://www.revenuecat.com/healthscore/) and discovered my next area to improve: my trial-to-paid conversion was very, very low. Not a surprise‚Äîsince with my app, users can easily clear out a lot of space during the free trial alone.

So I started building more generally useful features‚Äîlike a ‚Äúswipe to delete/sort‚Äù tool to make removing and organizing photos easier. Hopefully, that gives users more reasons to pay.

# 3. Iteration & exploration

After fixing the rating request issue, increasing the price, and adding the swipe to delete/sort feature, I also subscribed to [TryAstro](https://tryastro.app?aff=mdB65)(affiliate link) and began optimizing keywords. TryAstro helped me discover a lot of keywords I hadn‚Äôt thought of before. They also include two books on ASO optimization, which I found pretty helpful.

A little later, I ran another free promotion (posted on the subreddit r/iosapps). It brought in 5,000 downloads, 62 new ratings, and a lot of valuable feedback from Reddit.

And my revenue increased by 80% as a result (still not a huge amount overall, but enough to buy myself some coffee).

# Now & next steps

Now my app has 150 ratings, and the average rating is 4.9.

These days, I‚Äôm:

* I‚Äôve added Mixpanel to analyze user behavior. For example, my app offers multiple ways to organize photos, and I‚Äôm planning to build a widget‚ÄîMixpanel helps me understand which option users prefer, so I can prioritize the right widget first.
* Added a new app icon, hoping it‚Äôs more eye-catching and can attract more downloads than the old one.
* Using Apple‚Äôs App Store APIs to collect and analyze competitor app reviews, trying to understand what users actually want (or hate).
* Writing posts like this to get more feedback and hopefully gain a bit more exposure.

That‚Äôs all, this is my story.

1k3il5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k3il5x/aita_because_my_partner_keeps_saying_my_tone_is/,"AITA because my partner keeps saying my tone is rude, even when I‚Äôm not angry?","Apologies for the long text. I‚Äôve tried to explain everything as clearly and honestly as I can. English is not my first language, so apologies for any mistakes‚ÄîI‚Äôd really appreciate some outside perspective.
Let me know!

Me (F35) and my partner (M43) have been together for 4 years and have lived together for 3¬Ω years.
The last 1¬Ω years have been full of emotion. Around that time, my partner started drinking more, and we had a lot of arguments. Then we were forced to move out of our rental and struggled to find somewhere new.
I‚Äôm giving this background because I think it plays a role in how we treat each other.

Once my partner started drinking, he changed‚Äîand our dynamic changed too. He often said my tone was aggressive or that I sounded like I was having a go at him. (I‚Äôm German‚ÄîGerman is my first language, English is my second. My partner is British.)
I don‚Äôt think I come across that way. I try hard to check my tone and body language when I speak.

This became an ongoing issue. While he was drinking, I felt gaslighted‚Äîno matter how I spoke, I was told I was being aggressive or confrontational.

Fast forward: he went through detox and has been sober. He‚Äôs working on his mental health, goes to the gym several times a week, meditates, goes to interviews, and stays calm when things go wrong. I‚Äôm really proud of how he‚Äôs handling it.

But we still have the same issue‚Äîhe no longer gaslights me, but he still misinterprets what I say.

Example 1 ‚Äì breakfast:
I take my ADHD meds at 7 a.m., so I get up by 6:30 to eat first. My partner knows this (I‚Äôm currently on titration).
One morning, he offered to make me poached eggs, which made me happy because I struggle to get out of bed. He got up around 6:30, but instead of starting breakfast, he made coffee, a shake, and ate a banana. That‚Äôs fine‚Äîbut it got close to 7 a.m., and I needed to eat.

So I got up, had a banana with almond butter, and said‚Äîvery tiredly (he knows I‚Äôve been sleeping poorly):
‚ÄúI think I should have the poached eggs later since it‚Äôs almost 7 and I need to take my meds. I‚Äôll make beans on toast quickly.‚Äù
That‚Äôs my usual quick breakfast, and I often have a second one later since I work from home.

He got annoyed and said I was rude. But I wasn‚Äôt‚ÄîI was just tired and spoke in a neutral tone.

Also, he hadn‚Äôt started making the eggs. Then he said something I couldn‚Äôt hear (I was looking for a pot and the kettle was boiling), so I said, ‚ÄúPardon? Could you repeat that, please? I didn‚Äôt hear.‚Äù
He stayed quiet and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you have your breakfast.‚Äù

Then he went to do laundry, tossed dirty clothes onto the floor where they were in the way (we‚Äôve just moved and haven‚Äôt unpacked), kicked something out of frustration, and came back to say‚Äîcalmly‚Äîthat he was going to meditate.

I was sitting on the dining bench, and when he reached past for his headphones, he moved a chair so hard that it shifted the entire bench I was sitting on. This wasn‚Äôt a light nudge‚Äîit took effort.

Context:
I‚Äôm still grieving my mum, who passed recently. His mum died around the same time. I know he‚Äôs grieving too, but he‚Äôs at a more accepting stage. I‚Äôm not saying my grief is worse, but my mum was my only family‚Äîwe only had each other.
Now, all I have are a few good friends (who I‚Äôm truly grateful for) and my partner.

Example 2 ‚Äì church on Mother‚Äôs Day:
I wanted to go to church to light a candle. It‚Äôs hard to find a nearby Catholic church in the UK, but I finally found one.
When I got there, it was closed‚Äîeven though I had called ahead to check.

Back home, I told my partner that the church would be open on Sunday for Mother‚Äôs Day and that I planned to attend mass. He offered to come. I told him the time and reminded him a few times during the week, since it meant a lot to me. (I don‚Äôt go to church often, and I only want him to come if he truly wants to.)

On Sunday, he meditated while I got ready. (I reminded him again beforehand what time we needed to leave.)
Time was running out, and he still wasn‚Äôt dressed. Then he asked, ‚ÄúWhat time do we need to be at the church?‚Äù
I almost lost it‚Äîbut didn‚Äôt snap. I explained again that I‚Äôd reminded him multiple times. This mass was my way of honouring my mother on Mother‚Äôs Day, and I wanted to be on time.

He said I was speaking to him in an aggressive tone‚Äîagain. I wasn‚Äôt being aggressive, just upset.
He followed me to church and apologised before we left, but what disappointed me more was when he said, ‚ÄúI thought we were just going to light a candle,‚Äù‚Äîdespite me repeatedly saying it was a full mass, why I wanted to go, and what time it was. But I just swallowed that and said it was probably just a misunderstanding/miscommunication. 

Example 3 ‚Äì heat pads:
He ordered reusable heat pads. I told him how we used them back in school and explained how they work.
When they arrived, he wanted to test one‚Äîbut I didn‚Äôt catch that. I thought he didn‚Äôt know how they worked, so I said, ‚ÄúWait, wait, stop.‚Äù
He got angry, saying I was rude.

I calmly explained, ‚ÄúAll I wanted to say is: if you press that metal piece, it will activate the heat. Since it‚Äôs still liquid, it hasn‚Äôt been activated yet. You can save it and use it when you go out next time.‚Äù
He replied that I wasn‚Äôt aware of my tone and gave me a whole lecture on how he knew how it worked. I just said I misunderstood him and dropped it‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt want to argue about a heating pad.

Example 4 ‚Äì assumptions and interruptions:
Sometimes, when I‚Äôm trying to explain something or clarify what I thought he meant, he assumes I‚Äôm about to snap‚Äîeven when I‚Äôm not.
He interrupts me in a rude tone, which then makes me snap and tell him to actually listen. What he thinks I‚Äôm about to say is not what I was going to say at all.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
It seems like my partner doesn‚Äôt realise there are more than two communication tones. I can sound tired, serious, or upset‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm angry or having a go.

But to him, it seems like there are only two options: happy or angry.

I‚Äôve never had this issue in past relationships/friendships or at work‚Äîbeing constantly told I sound rude or being misunderstood like this. Or maybe no one ever told me the way I sound? 

He often says, ‚ÄúIn my version of reality, it was like this‚Ä¶‚Äù I get that people interpret things differently. But sometimes, it‚Äôs just a misunderstanding‚Äîand it‚Äôs okay to admit you‚Äôre wrong.
When I realise I‚Äôve misunderstood, I say, ‚ÄúOh, I thought you meant this,‚Äù and move on.
With him, it feels like he clings to his version of reality unless it‚Äôs something really obvious‚Äîthen he‚Äôll admit it.

I know when I‚Äôm being snappy, and I own it. I‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I snapped, here‚Äôs why.‚Äù But being tired or using a neutral tone is not the same as being mean. Also what do I gain from snapping without any reason?

I‚Äôve had so many conversations with him about this. I‚Äôve told him: not everything can be said with a happy tone. Every situation may have different emotions - I can speak while visibly upset‚Äîmy tone, face, and body show that.
That doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm attacking him.

Am I the asshole here?
Or do I not realise how I come across sometimes? Or is it the words I chose that I would say in German that makes me come across rude? ",5,1745140224.0,AITAH,15,1.0,False

I started using minoxidil 5% formula with the recommended dose on my beard where it was needed. I was on a 3 month plan and started January 18th. After a month I noticed I was starting to get some very restless nights.

So up until then it was great and no side affects but as I said, after a month in, it started with me waking up earlier than usual. (With work I usually sleep from 23:30 - 07:45) so now I was waking at 0500 with an elevated heart rate. This became pretty consistent until around month 3.

This was where it got really bad. Starting my third month it got to a stage where I would get into bed and literally not sleep at all. (Very strange for an avid honker like me.) I would get into bed at usual time 23:30 and just litreally lay down and toss and turn the whole night until I would dose off at around 0630 only to be woken up by my alarm an hour later.

The following night I could sleep so I thought maybe that was just a once off but I came to realise this was entirely due to my body being exhausted from the night before. The same thing literally happened the next night AGAIN.

I was naive at first and started cutting out things I more or less used my whole life. No caffeine, no alcohol, nothing with sugar before bed.  STILL not able to sleep until the following night after a restless night.

It got to a stage where I had some sort of anxiety around bed time. A feeling of dread, Racing thoughts, you name it. I was getting so stressed by heart rate was increasing and my pulsatile tinnitus was on overdrive. All whilst still applying 2x daily dosage onto the face / beard.

Eventually it clicked in my brain the only thing left to try. Stop using minoxidil.

The first night was more or less the same but I fell asleep earlier then before, maybe 03:30am which was fantastic taking into consideration I was getting tops maybe 2 hours previously on the restless nights.

I‚Äôm 8 days minoxidil free now and am back to my usual self. Sleeping from 2330 to 0745. I can drink my coffee, I can have a beer or two before bed. I have even went on a night out and came home around 0230am and STILL I could just fall asleep instantly. Happy days.

People have said maybe to use the 2% or only use 1 dose a day. Fck that and Fck minoxidil. In my eyes it‚Äôs an insomnia inducing poison and I‚Äôd advise anyone with side effects to any degree to just drop it as my life has returned to normality after axing it. 3 months too long.

I have 2 kids from before (19m and 15f) and we have one together (6m). I always had a great relationship with the inlaws, went to the ballet and for coffee with the mil (72f) shopping and afternoon tea. That sort of thing. My father in law passed away 4 years ago. It was really sudden and unexpected. It hit everyone hard. Hubby is an only child so I took over, I arranged with the funeral home, with the coroner, checked in on my mother in law. I popped in every afternoon to check on her when I did the school run. She helped with childcare and had 6yo a couple times a week for us to work (she‚Äôs retired). Well last year I had a great opportunity at work. Better, fixed hours, more pay. But also more responsibilities and stuff so I spoke to hubby and mil about going for it. They both encouraged me and I landed the promotion (yay!). The hours worked out that mil would only have 6yo twice a week for 2 hours each time during school term but 4 hours for school breaks. But also that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to pop over as much anymore, I would only be able to pop in when I was picking 6yo up or prearranged coffees and stuff when I booked time off. I said to hubs to invite her for Friday dinner (I work a late on a Friday but she always had a takeaway with fil that day then stopped because she couldn‚Äôt order for 1 so I figured they could order together, I paid). This was fine for a month then one day she text my hubs and said she didn‚Äôt want to see 6yo as it was too much. This was on a day that she was meant to watch him and we were both working. I sorted childcare that day and hubs went to speak to her, she said she was struggling and felt she couldn‚Äôt watch 6yo anymore. We were asking how we can support her and she said she didn‚Äôt want us to visit everyday anymore. She retreated into herself quite a bit. I encouraged hubs to pop over, call and text. One day hubs aunt called me to say she was worried about mil, she was saying she felt alone and we didn‚Äôt see her anymore so I explained everything happening and sent screenshots of conversations to show we were being supportive but also trying to give the space she asked for. Well aunt sent me a screenshot of mil saying she didn‚Äôt want to watch 6yo, fil had said they would always help and support us but he had left her with the responsibility and she didn‚Äôt want it, she never asked for a grandchild. I was upset. Spoke to hub and we decided to speak to mil, I told her she was pushing everyone away, she was really dismissive and rude about 6yo, then she went on a rant about me. She was upset I didn‚Äôt go over anymore so I explained with new job I didn‚Äôt have time but her son was there instead. She had a go saying I was lucky to still have my husband supporting me. I tried explaining how I was supporting her son, then she went on saying I like to upset people, I wouldn‚Äôt let her wear a white dress to our wedding (come on people!! She wanted a white wedding dress, knee length, lacy, 50s tea dress style). I decided to leave then she got right up in my face, threatening to kill herself. I saw red and told to f**king do it, she does not have the right to threaten that in front of my husband while he‚Äôs still grieving. We left but I sent hubs back to make sure she was ok. A week later it was our anniversary and mil went radio silent. We popped over on anniversary and she refused to even acknowledge me. Spoke to hub fine but nothing for me. I left and she told hub I had to apologise to her and she wouldn‚Äôt speak to me. I refused. Said I should have said it better but I won‚Äôt apologise for protecting my hub. Fast firward to Xmas and she told hub she wanted a quiet Xmas on her own, he said he‚Äôd call her and pop over Xmas eve, Boxing Day and respect that she wanted an alone Xmas (he‚Äôs an idiot but I love him). Xmas day he called her and I said to pop over but he was adamant she said she wanted a quiet one on her own (like I said, idiot!). New comes and she writes him a letter saying how alone she felt at Xmas and that I was purposefully excluding her from things and she was so upset and lonely. She felt I was banishing her from my family and keeping her son away from her (her words). I went to speak to her and said it wasn‚Äôt fair for hub to be stuck in middle. It didn‚Äôt go well and I left after telling her she couldn‚Äôt manipulate me and she chased me shouting that I couldn‚Äôt walk away from her. That was 4 months ago, we went to talk to mil yday and she at first refused to acknowledge me. Hubs suggested ‚Äòpushing reset button‚Äô. She demanded I apologise. He said he wanted it all left in the past and we start over. She carried on making digs, she just needs to be quiet sometimes, I treat her like a child‚Ä¶. So I said ok before we reset let‚Äôs air this shiz. How do I treat her like a child, she started crying and saying she didn‚Äôt wanna talk about it and that I was intimidating her and stuff. She eventually said I had replied to a text after she had a go at me. I said I‚Äôd sent hub over because I didn‚Äôt know what to say that wouldn‚Äôt make it worse. She then said she‚Äôd reset but I have to text her to check she‚Äôs ok. I can‚Äôt ignore her anymore and I couldn‚Äôt just say hubs texts her. I said I‚Äôll try but I don‚Äôt want all the pressure since I have a busy job and family. She said I have to text her or it won‚Äôt work. So AITAH for refusing? I said I‚Äôll try but that‚Äôs as good as it‚Äôs gonna get for me. I just don‚Äôt want to if I‚Äôm honest but will for hubs to feel less torn.",2,1745139514.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

1k3ieql,https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/1k3ieql/can_i_bring_my_tea/,Can I Bring My Tea?,"The echoes of last nights dream lingered in my mind as I woke up. The sense of comfort that the dream gave me slowly dissipated into the relentless depression which permeated my consciousness. I wasn‚Äôt where I expected to be either; I found myself sitting somewhat uprght in a neutral pink armchair in the living room with a flowers embroidered into it. My lower back ached from being slumped in an unnatural position for so long and my hangover made me feel unclean. I found myself in yesterdays clothes; a white t-shirt, some black joggers and a black pair of socks. I pulled myself up straight in the chair to relieve the pressure on my back and gently moved my arms and legs. The familiar twinge of pain emanating from above my left knee ‚Äì a reminder of chronic knee problems - did not appear. On the nearby wooden coffee table sat two bottles of wine and an empty wine glass, a drop of burgundy liquid sitting at the bottom of it. I noticed a box on the table, however without my glasses on I could not make out the text on it. I looked around the room; and felt a pregnant stillness in the house. I manoeuvred myself out of the chair and walked slowly towards the hallway. I called out, but my call echoed and dissipated to no response. I shambled into the kitchen to make a cup of tea.

I absently glanced out of the kitchen window while waiting for the hot water to boil, and noticed a rip in the sky open just above the garden. A figure dropped down into the garden. I froze for a second and dropped to the floor to hide. Against my fear, I scrambled towards the window and hid behind the washing machine which sat underneath it. I gripped the edge of the washing machine and peered up over it. I saw nothing. Suddenly the figure peeked out at me and waved enthusiastically, almost mockingly It knocked on the window and said, ‚ÄúAlright mate,‚Äù in an Essex accent. I ducked again, pressing my back up against the washing machine, eyes bulging and breathing heavily. It followed up with, ‚ÄúCan you come outside? I need to talk to you‚Äù. I peered over again. ‚ÄúPlease?‚Äù it yearned. I stood up looking at it, my face like a crashed computer. It tapped again, breaking me out of my trance-like state. Without thinking I replied, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming. Can I bring my tea?‚Äù. It smiled at me and nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll b-be there in a minute‚Äù, I stuttered. A heat ran through my whole body but I felt unthreatened; my instincts told me that I could trust it.

I poured the hot water onto the teabag in the cup and picked it up by the handle, recoiling from burning my knuckles on the piping hot mug. I headed towards the back door, where my sliders were. I slid my left foot then my right into each respective slider. Through the patio doors I could see it waiting and smiling. I turned the key, opened the doors and stepped out onto the step. ‚ÄúMy old mate‚Äù it said through a smile, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been waiting to meet you for a long time. It‚Äôs good to meet you.‚Äù I stepped down and towards it. I felt confused. It stepped forward, put an arm a round my shoulders, hugging me. The amiable tone was replaced by one which was a slightly firmer; ‚ÄúMe old mate, we need to talk. Can we go in there?‚Äù It pointed at the summerhouse. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather the neighbours didn‚Äôt hear‚Äù. I muttered, ‚ÄúEr, yeah sure‚Äù. ‚ÄúFantastic‚Äù it cooed warmly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited!‚Äù

I walked up to the summerhouse and turned the key, pulling the door towards me. I stepped back and ushered it in with a flat, ‚ÄúAfter you‚Äù. It smiled, thanked me and pulled up a chair. I sat on the futon, bracing the cup in two hands. It looked at me, smiled, paused and then asked me, ‚ÄúHow are you feeling today?‚Äù I looked down, ‚ÄúWell that depends on what you want to hear‚Ä¶‚Äù, I spat bitterly. ‚ÄúDo you want an answer or do you want the truth?‚Äù. It smiled, ‚ÄúThe truth please‚Äù. I wanted to spill my guts but I had done it so many times before that it felt pointless. ‚ÄúI feel like utter crap. My body feels like its falling apart and I‚Äôm hungover. My shoulder is arthritic and my knee is painful. My bloody back is sore too.... I miss wrestling as it helped me deal with things gave me confidence, but I don‚Äôt feel I can do it right now. I don‚Äôt feel myself. The mental professionals are indifferent. If I discuss my problems normally it sounds like I‚Äôm not in much bother; when I lose my mind, they don‚Äôt want to know and the only help they offer comes after the breakdown has come and gone. I get pushed from pillar to post. I have no self worth. The frustration had been replaced by resignation. ‚ÄúI just feel disillusioned. I have never liked myself, I don‚Äôt know why. The only time I ever liked myself was for five minutes two years ago‚Ä¶.I blame others for my problems but I have a hole I can‚Äôt fill‚Äù. I was losing control of my breathing and I felt tears welling up in my eyes. ‚ÄúLook at me crying, I feel stupid.‚Äù It nodded and smiled. It stood up, pushed it closer to me and sat down again, putting its hand on my right arm. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright to cry,‚Äù it said; I felt a comfort from it which was abstract to me previously.

It smiled and sighed. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve watched you. We recognised your differences as a child. We saw your struggles with self confidence and self esteem and how others took advantage of you. You will learn to love yourself. We have not intervened because we knew we would see you again, however we were surprised that it would be so soon.‚Äù A cold fear ran down my spine; it felt like my heart had missed a beat. ‚ÄúWhat did I do?‚Äù I cried through the phlegm and tears. It got up and opened the door out onto the garden. ‚ÄúLet me show you‚Äù. I put my tea to my mouth and it burned my lips. I asked it, ‚ÄúCan I bring my tea?‚Äù ‚ÄúSure‚Äù, it smiled.

It lead me out of the summerhouse back and back down the steps towards the patio doors. It stopped before we got there. ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt go in‚Ä¶..just look‚Äù. I saw people in the room, some in green, some in suits, accompanied with indeterminate chatter. Two men in green outfits stood by the chair I was in; I could only make out the legs. The wine bottles and glass remained on the coffee table. I heard, ‚Äú‚Ä¶..and a box of Naproxen. None left‚Äù. A man in a suit picked up a note and opened it. Offhand, he muttered, ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a note‚Äù; he read it out loud, ‚ÄúI needed help ‚Äì I can‚Äôt do it anymore.‚Äù The man dropped into a clear plastic bag and walked away from the chair. I could see the figure now; it wore a white tee, black joggers and black socks. In the background I saw them lay out a long black bag. ‚ÄúPlace him inside it when you‚Äôre ready‚Äù. Two paramedics picked me up and put me on the bag. Towards front of the house I heard more voices. I could pick out cries of, ‚Äúlet me see him,‚Äù and, ‚Äúlet me see my boy‚Äù which increased. My mother barged her way in and dropped to her knees, cradled my body to her chest and wailed, ‚Äúmy boy‚Äù with a primal howl.

My eyes began watering. ‚ÄúI begged them to help me.‚Äù I sat down on the steps and began softly sobbing into my hands. It sat down beside me, ‚ÄúI know you did.‚Äù It started to softly cry with me. ‚ÄúNo more pain for you, we will help you learn to love yourself‚Äù. I heard cries of ‚ÄúNo, no, no‚Äù as I saw three men in suits drag my mother away. One paramedic zipped the bag up and with one at each end, picked me up and carried me out. I howled until I became tired. I lifted my head up and turned to it whimpering, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared, I want to go home.‚Äù It smiled, ‚ÄúCome with me, it‚Äôs where we are going.‚Äù ‚ÄúCan I bring my tea?‚Äù It smiled, ‚ÄúSure‚Äù. I went into the summerhouse grabbed my cup of tea. Inside I reverted to being a two year old boy and found my favourite teddy. I pushed the door open and ran over to the alien.

I (22F) had a mild UTI two summers ago and it was the worst pain I‚Äôve ever experienced. Yesterday I noticed I‚Äôve been going to the bathroom more often than normal with my usual intake of water and before I go, I feel like I‚Äôve been holding it for a really long time even though I haven‚Äôt been. I can‚Äôt really tell if it‚Äôs just the sort of ‚Äúphantom pain‚Äù from having had one in the past or if I could potentially have another one. I can‚Äôt exactly tell if I‚Äôm overreacting or not, but I‚Äôve gone to the bathroom twice in two hours and I went before going to bed because I learned to do that the hard way after having the UTI. I should probably add that I‚Äôve been consuming a bit more coffee and alcohol lately but not an excessive amount (work and college stress.) I‚Äôm not noticing any blood spots like I did with the UTI in 2023 and the trip I took to the ER just for a blood and urine test was horrible.
(I‚Äôm not pregnant, I took a test yesterday and it was negative.)

Am I overthinking? Could it be stress induced? Or should I get it checked?

Forward and former captain Aidan Nugent has been charged with two counts of sexual assault and two counts of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.

The alleged offences, which Nugent strenuously denies, are said to have been committed while members of the team, family members and senior county GAA figures were on holiday in the Florida city of Miami last November.

Nugent declined to discuss the case with Sunday Life
Nugent declined to discuss the case with Sunday Life
Armagh claimed their second ever All-Ireland win last summer with a 1-11 to 0-13 victory over Galway which went down to the wire at Croke Park.

Nugent was on the substitutes bench for the match but did not play in the game.

The 30-year-old is due to appear before Armagh Magistrates Court on May 6.

Sunday Life called to Nugent‚Äôs home outside the Armagh village of Newtownhamilton last week but was told by a woman who answered the door he did not wish to discuss the case.

When this newspaper contacted Nugent by phone he hung up.

The accused owns a gym called R8 ‚Äî Cardio and Coffee in Armagh city, but customers have said he had not been seen there recently.

He was also was part of the St Patrick‚Äôs, Cullyhanna, team which won the All-Ireland intermediate title at Croke Park in January last year.

After the win, Nugent spoke of how much the victory meant to people in Armagh as a whole.

‚ÄúEven outside of Cullyhanna, you were talking to people who‚Äôd lost loved ones over Christmas that are from Armagh and they‚Äôve told us that the football has given them a massive lift,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúSo, it makes you think what it‚Äôs done for Cullyhanna people who‚Äôve lost loved ones.‚Äù

Nugent is alleged to have committed the attack in Miami
A qualified teacher, Nugent was educated at St Paul‚Äôs High School in Bessbrook before going on to study at St Mary‚Äôs University College in Belfast.

Following the announcement of Nugent being charged, his solicitor said: ‚ÄúI am shocked by the decision of the PSNI to charge my client in relation to an incident that occurred outside the jurisdiction last year.

‚ÄúI believe there was no necessity to arrest my client.

‚ÄúA formal complaint was made to the PSNI on November 20, 2024. No contact was made between the PSNI and my client for three weeks.

‚ÄúWhen requested, he presented himself voluntarily at Banbridge Police station where he was arrested over four months ago.

‚ÄúThe request by the PSNI to charge, I believe, is without merit and shall be challenged further down the line.

‚ÄúI believe the decision to charge the suspect to court by the PSNI is influenced by the media publicity this case has attracted due to his profession and in breach of my client‚Äôs right to a fair trial and in breach of his right to private and family rights.

‚ÄúMy client maintains his innocent and has instructed me to contest the charges fully.‚Äù

A police spokesperson said last week: ‚ÄúA 30-year-old man was arrested on December 10, 2024, on suspicion of a number of sexual-related offences alleged to have taken place in the United States of America in November 2024.

‚ÄúHe was later released on bail to allow for further enquiries to be carried out.‚Äù

They added: ‚ÄúAs is normal procedure, all charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service, and police will not be commenting further as criminal justice proceedings progress.‚Äù",16,1745139115.0,GAA,23,1.0,False

I've been on the OMAD diet for about a week now, and I feel like something might be off ‚Äî or maybe it's normal and I'm just overthinking.

The thing is, I barely feel hungry at all. I usually have my one meal between 5 and 6 PM, and for the rest of the day I just drink water, black coffee, or herbal tea. I don‚Äôt exercise and I spend most of my time at home, so I'm not very active.

Before starting OMAD, I used to eat two meals a day (lunch and dinner). Even though I was inactive back then too, I still used to feel hungry often ‚Äî and honestly, I‚Äôd sometimes overeat. But now, with OMAD, I rarely feel any hunger, even close to meal time.

Is this just my body adjusting? Or does it have to do with my low activity level? I‚Äôm just a bit confused because I thought I‚Äôd be struggling with hunger, especially in the first week ‚Äî but it‚Äôs been the exact opposite.

I need scientific explanations before I lose it.,"So throughout the years I‚Äôve experienced some strange things in my apartment, and I don‚Äôt want to jump to ‚Äúit‚Äôs a ghost‚Äù because I really don‚Äôt believe in that stuff. Here‚Äôs some background:

I live on the top floor of an older apartment complex. Throughout the years I‚Äôve witnessed the following 
 - I was sitting watching TV. I had a mug on the coffee table in front of me. I watched it as it slowly slid to the right about 6 inches as if someone was pushing it. I couldn‚Äôt explain it at all. It was on a coaster, and there was no condensation underneath. The table is level, and it‚Äôs never happened before or again since. 
- I was in the living room with my fiance. We both watched our cat‚Äôs play tunnel roll across the floor out of nowhere, once again as if something pushed it. My cats were all asleep in the other room. There were no windows open or any possible sources of wind. Both of us were weirded out and witnessed the whole thing. 
- My fiance has a heavy stainless steel water bottle. One night, we both witnessed it fall out of no where and roll across the floor. It was as if something pushed it, because it rolled pretty far. The cats were not nearby. Even a breeze couldn‚Äôt have caused it, because that thing is pretty heavy even when empty.
- today, we heard a rustle and thump in the kitchen. A bag of onions which were sitting on a shelf for the last few days fell off the shelf somehow. They were stable on that shelf for a while. The cats were with us at the time. Neither of us could explain it.

I keep jokingly saying that it‚Äôs the spirit of my late cat Buck coming to visit us (just because all of these things seem like what a cat *would* do, but our alive cats have never been the cause). That being said, I really can‚Äôt explain any of this and I‚Äôm starting to feel a little paranoid. Please give me some scientific explanations. Could it be due to foundation issues or something? Could it have anything to do with quantum physics or parallel universes? Has anyone else experienced odd things like this in an apartment? Are ghosts actually real?

I would love to make a summary of everything that happened but my story is too long, I will leave a TL/DR at the end. (The rest of The story Is in my porfile)

Things are much better than I expected Jack was dumped by Amelia, I had mentioned earlier that Amelia promised not to go looking for Amanda as she couldn't be sure she would react nicely to seeing her, but the world is small and the two of them ended up meeting at a nearby cafe when Amanda was hanging out with her new ""friends"" (the former bullies) Marcos and I, Hehe it sounds weird but apparently I was included in the group.

We walked into the cafe and there she was, Amelia enjoying a coffee by herself, she had lost some weight, she looked quite happier and when she saw Amanda she immediately approached us, I won't lie to you when I say Amanda had a ""I want to disappear right now"" look on her face but she stood her ground, the two of them started talking, they were far away but I could hear what they were saying, each one told her perspective and Amanda was very nervous but she was honest, obviously Amelia didn't take it well at all that Amanda had ignored the previous warnings, (she yelled AND insultes her a bit at first) but she understood her position, mentioning that she wouldn't trust the advice of her goons either (Amanda didn't mention me).

They both cried and in the end it seemed to work out well? Or so he thought as apparently Amelia had other intentions with Amanda.... No, it's not what you think, there were no beatings.... They are dating, I don't know how it happened... But Amelia is apologizing to her former victims... (My childhood friend also received her apology but didn't accept it, understandable) And apparently she found out that that irrational and somewhat (too) violent jealousy in the past was covert attraction to women.

They've only been dating for about 4? Or maybe 5 days dating? I haven't asked the exact figure but they seem very happy?

The one who did get beat up was me, looks like Jack found out I was the snitch, I'm missing a tooth and have a broken rib but at least he's missing a tooth too (He's twice my height but Im not move badly at least, well, enough to knock a tooth out of the guy who is clearly stronger than me, plus with such an ideal ending, I don't regret anything) in other news Jennifer, Amanda's new friend (just arrived, she's not one of Amanda's ex thugs) seems to be showing interest in me, she visited me at the hospital yesterday afternoon, I don't know if it's a romantic interest but I don't care, a good friendship is never denied and it's just what I need.

TL/DR: understanding the situation, Jack's ex wife is now dating my coworker (Jack's former lover) after finding out that her violent jealousy was actually covert attraction and that I had no reason to hate her, my coworker didn't get a beating but I did, I don't care and now I have a new friend",3,1745137127.0,AITAH,6,0.67,False

I feel this tightness in my chest, almost like my heart is carrying a heavy burden. There are days when it‚Äôs so bad, it feels hard to breathe, like my body‚Äôs screaming for connection but I don‚Äôt know how to answer.

And that‚Äôs when it hit me: if I keep waiting for things to magically get better, they‚Äôre never going to. Just like you can‚Äôt wait for weight loss to happen without doing something about it, I can‚Äôt wait for social skills to magically improve. I have to actually put in the work.

So, starting today, I‚Äôm treating my social skills like a skill. Something I can get better at with practice. Like weight loss. Like getting stronger. I‚Äôm going to work on it every day  even if it feels uncomfortable.

I‚Äôm committing to:

* Being more open with people.
* Sharing value in small ways.
* Letting go of the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù version of myself and just being real.
* Tracking my progress here.

This is Day 1.  
If you‚Äôre feeling that loneliness too, you‚Äôre not alone. I‚Äôm in this with you, trying to improve bit by bit. It‚Äôs okay to not be perfect. We‚Äôre just starting the journey.

Day 1 Exercise:  
 Talk to one person today that you usually wouldn‚Äôt.  
Maybe it‚Äôs:

* Saying ‚Äúhi‚Äù to the shopkeeper instead of just paying and leaving.
* Asking the barista how their day‚Äôs going, even if you‚Äôre just grabbing a coffee.
* Giving a compliment to someone you normally wouldn‚Äôt talk to  like a neighbor or someone at the gym.

It doesn‚Äôt have to be a big conversation.  
The goal is just to push past the awkwardness and do something different. Break the ice, take a step forward. No pressure, no expectations. Just a simple rep to get started.

I‚Äôm excited to see how this goes, and if you‚Äôre in the same boat, feel free to join me. We‚Äôll make progress together, one small step at a time.( I will update soonnnn)",9,1745136749.0,confidence,0,1.0,False
