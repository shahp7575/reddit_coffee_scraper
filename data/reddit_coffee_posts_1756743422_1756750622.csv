1n5w61m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1n5w61m/aitah_for_telling_my_gf_the_truth/,AITAH for telling my gf the truth,"I 20M have been dating my girlfriend emma 22F for the past year now and lets say i have seen a lot of changes in here behavior. Like the once i come back from a boys night out because I forgot my wallet only to find emma in the bathroom cleaning herself with a wet tissue she shrugged it off saying she was just cleaning the extra dirt of since she already showered today so she wont have to shower again using up extra water i didnt pay it much attention at first 

The second time I began to notice some really wired behavior is about 3 weeks ago when i was showering i noticed her beloved body wash was almost still full while my soap had to be changed twice . Anyways I finished shower and wen to put the dirty clothes in the washroom when i saw a small basket in the corner beside the washing machine i looked at it and realize it was some of emmas panties i was going to turn away but curiosity got the best of me i looked closer and realized that there were worn like she was going to put them in the machine but looking closer i saw that they had some white cheesy stuff on then i was confused as to what it was but it also had a hint smell of tuna i place them back and pretend i didnt see anything 


Fast forward to about 2 nights ago we were laying on the couch watching a movie when she began to rub my chest and kissing me initiating intimacy i was already curious to tin out what is happening with her recently so i thought i could use this moment to try and figure it out about 4 minutes in to cuddle she got on too of me and started kissing me atp i was already turned on so i slid my hand in the trousers and felt thwt she had been wet already but also felt so strange little lump in her panties i was going to ask her about it when suddenly my phone wrong it was tom my best friend he said he had been in a small accident and ask if i could take a spare tire to him i explained her and she was upset but i was kind of relieved since i felt those lumps


After helping tom and going back hime I remembered what had happened earlier and i googled it and according to google it says it caused by lack of proper hygiene I was grossed out but kept it cool till i got home i was going to ask her about it but when i got home she was asleep 

I went to the shower freshened up and was getting ready for bed when i noticed that emmas short where slightly wet i knew that she had showered because she was in a different outfit from when i had left but so it couldn’t had been from earlier i turned on the a flashlight on my phone to get a closer look when i smell that same tuna smell from the clothes in the wash room and i did something im not proud of but I pulled her shorts the side and that it was all soaked i waa about to wake her when i felt something wet on my finger it was like grool but it was kinda yellow and smelled like tuna i let go of her shorts washed my hands and slept on the couch that night 

In the morning i woke up to her in the kitchen making coffee and noticed that she was in a different outfit from what she was asleep in and instantly I remembered what had happened before i went to bed i poured myself some coffee and told her I needed to speak with her expression look almost like a what do you want emotion i looked at her and ask she had been having any trouble with her hygiene and she looked at me with disgust and said why would i asume that i told her all that i saw and did and she started crying saying im disgusting and i didn’t understand and that she is just going through something she cant quite understand and i stood there confused asf because sshe was making no sense and i didnt understand whatever her point was 

Later that day she called saying she going go to the doctor but that she will be staying at her mom for the weekend and she would let me know wa happened



She caught a infection trying to follow a dumb trend of not using soap to shower only water",2,1756750301.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False
1n5w5co,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadandNeckCancer/comments/1n5w5co/off_topic_your_music_sucks_at_rt/,"Off topic, ""Your music sucks!"" at RT","My way to cope with just about anything: music.

The first day of actual RT which takes about 40 min to ""get the beams right"" and they had a speaker with music playing the entire time. My blood pressure kept going up (I could feel it) because...pop chart nondescript 90's to now was all they played. It was the only time I wanted to rip my mask off to turn the speaker off. When we were done and they took the mask off, first thing I said a bit too loudly ""Your music sucks!"". The 3 techs stopped for a second all looking at each other as in ""No one has ever said anything about that before"" one younger kid looked at me and said ""Country?"". I could only glare at him in a way he thought I might deck him. I informed them I would play my own music on my phone in the room and rather quickly they said you can't get wifi or bluetooth in the room (duh, I would hope this chamber of **radiation** can't fry the building and everyone in it), our family was construction, I knew better.

""No problem. I have entire playlists downloaded and my phone is as loud as I am"".

They were hesitant in that ""Okay but we don't know if that will work"" kind of way so the next day I bounce in, clear an area on their desk station in the room and set my phone down hitting play. They stood still. Sweet sweet hardcore metal is now filling the room with it's amazing complexity and calmness and this confused look came across everyone's faces for moment, then they all smiled. I had to process why they were smiling...did they not expect it? Cuz I'm 64? They didn't see my limited edition hoodie that said ""Spoiled by Metal"" when I walked in? They liked it? 

Either way, every morning I'd que up 3 to 4 songs adding up the time to match how long treatment would take and what matched my mood. The techs started to look forward to my selection that day, they knew most of what I played or the band/singer and would either start singing along and bouncing around the room with a lighter step. I was the 10am slot though they started to put me in half an hour earlier to start their day, just the right time after coffee, a few patients and battling the two rad rooms for dominance over the machines. 

It got me through 7 weeks of treatment quite well though I couldn't sing along...but they would crack up into the room speaker when my fingers were tapping along on the table. You never know what you're in for until you just do it your way, whatever it is that helps you along, do it. The staff will miss you and be much more invested in a positive outcome 🫶",1,1756750259.0,HeadandNeckCancer,0,1.0,False

Another model?,"While I don't think the ZP6 is dramatically bad for anything, there are some coffees where I'd be interested to see what another grinder can do. I also have a JX Pro (abridged grinder journey is Capresso Infinity + Skerton --> JX Pro --> ZP6), but the amount of fines the JX Pro throws out is now so annoying to me that I've been avoiding doing that comparison. Was going to get the K-Ultra but then started debating the Pietro, which I maybe regret not getting instead of the ZP6. 

I intended to pair the ZP6 with the JX Pro but since getting the ZP6 I haven't touched the JX Pro except for some travel and camping (not ideal for that but didn't want to bring the ZP6). My use case is pourover with some smattering of Aeropress and French Press in there, in other words, non-espresso.

So if you were to add something else to your grinder quiver what would it be to pair with a ZP6? Would you even bother? I'm thinking just one but it's hard to quit the habit as my travel setup with a JX Pro is not optimal :) I'm not super price sensitive at $500 USD or below although I prefer to pay less (of course). I'm also not interested in anything electric at the moment. The Femobook is about as electric as I could consider but I'd miss the hand grinding ritual so not really in that market.

not sure if it's relevant, but here are my stats/experiences:

* gpa 3.6, oat practice scores of 350-370
* opto tech for 1/2 year, shadowed/interned for 1/2 year, shift lead at coffee shop for 3 years
* a few recreational clubs (climbing/bouldering, badminton

1n5w0vb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1n5w0vb/evaluate_the_best_electric_kettle_zwilling/,Evaluate the Best Electric Kettle ZWILLING Enfinigy Worth It,"The ZWILLING 53105-100-0 electric kettle quickly became a staple in my daily routine from day one. On paper, it looked stylish enough to catch my attention, but the real intrigue came with all the subtle and thoughtful touches that make it unlike your average water-boiling contraption. This isn't just a kettle—it's like the Mercedes of kitchen appliances, with precise German engineering meeting modern, user-focused design. At first glance, it balances practicality with aesthetics in a way that makes you want to flaunt it on your kitchen counter, not tuck it away in a corner.

**Design and Aesthetics**  
Every time I look at the sleek silver finish paired with its powder-coated surface, I feel a little smug about my kitchen setup. The electric kettle features a double-walled design, something I didn’t know I needed until I accidentally bumped into it mid-boil and realized it stayed cool to the touch. The 70° lid opening feels like a small but significant win—you don’t get assaulted by hot steam every time you open it. Frankly, I didn’t expect to notice details like these as much as I have, but they’ve made a difference in my daily interactions with this thing. Oh, and with dimensions like 9.37"" x 8.77"" x 9.6"", it fits snugly on the counter without hogging too much space.  

**Performance and Functionality**  
This kettle delivers amazing performance. It boils water unbelievably fast. My morning rush to brew coffee turned stress-free because within a few short minutes, I’ve got hot water at the perfect temperature for my pour-over. The kettle also does a marvelous job of keeping water warm longer thanks to its double-wall insulation. And guess what? Cleanup is effortless. The seamless stainless-steel interior prevents residue build-up, so it’s practically fuss-free.  

[Check ZWILLING 53105-100-0 price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b09x6bhbfq/)  

**Benefits**  
If you’re still on the fence, here are some key upsides I’ve come to love:  
- Double-walled construction keeps water hot but the exterior cool.
- Features a 70° lid design, limiting hot steam exposure.  
- Sleek stainless-steel interior ensures easy cleanup without residue.  
- Lightweight yet feels sturdy, weighing only 2.86 pounds.

**Caveats**  
Nothing’s perfect, right? A few drawbacks deserve a mention:  
- The manual-only nature of temperature controls may not appeal to those who love all things digital.  
- It’s not the largest option—1-liter capacity maxes out quickly if you’re hosting multiple people needing tea or coffee.  
- Lacks a water window for immediate visibility, which might frustrate those used to kettles with such features.

**Competing Brands**  
Sure, I’d initially considered alternatives like Breville or Cuisinart models while on the hunt for an upgrade. Breville kettles usually boast more robust options for precise temperature settings, appealing to hardcore tea brewers. But guess what those lack? The unique double-wall design that ensures you won’t burn your fingers on accidental brushes. Similarly, while Cuisinart’s offerings are well-priced, the minimalist elegance of this electric kettle blows them out of the water in sheer aesthetics. If it’s form *and* function you want, the ZWILLING pulls ahead of its competitors.

**Value for Money**  
Where pricing is concerned, this kettle feels worth every penny. Other high-end kettles in the same range might edge you out on niche features, but they miss adding such thoughtful elements like the cool-to-the-touch finish. For anyone looking at long-term investments, this one’s functionality and durability more than justify its cost.

I like being told to drink water and talked to like I'm being trained to achieve something. Feel free to incorporate some pet play if you think it fits.

I can't handle pain well so as soon as it starts getting painful, I won't last long. I love earning my release thru tasks and feel free to push me a bit, I may say no but just a bit of insisting can get me very far.

He brewed it, took a sip, and immediately went pale. He kept running to the bathroom the rest of the day, muttering about his heart racing.

I took photos of everywhere I saw damage or scratches on the bike. I was going to list it on ebay with a Buy it Now of $1K, but I figured I'd throw it up here and see if anyone wanted to save me the trouble.

The bike is in Fort Wayne, IN, and it's got 4K miles. I just pulled it out of long-term storage (4 years), threw in a brand new battery, a pair of NGK Iridium IXs, and had it serviced by an actual mechanic this spring, if you're concerned about the low mileage. It's got brand new Progressive 412HD shocks on the back (like 150 miles). It will come with the stock seat, the oem shocks, a low pro fairing, and a coffee can of bolts I'm petty sure came off of it. The stock mirrors have walked off, sorry.

It starts and will move under its own power, and I think the front forks are possibly OK, but I wouldn't swear to it. Definitely have the front wheel and brake checked by someone who knows what they're doing. In one of the photos you can see the damage to the bump stops on the triple tree and the stem.

If anyone has any interest, just DM me, I'll answer any question you have; I don't want to hide anything from a potential buyer. If we work something out, you can come get it or arrange shipping, I'll help load it.

I’m preparing to move to the UK (Oldham) for my Bachelor’s in Business, and I’ve got plenty of time before going. I want to use this time to learn some practical skills that could actually help me once I’m there.

Skills I already have:

Graphic design

Video editing

Baking

Fluent English


Skills I’m considering learning:

Barbering (hair stylist)

Barista (coffee making)

Pizza making


The thing is, I’m not sure which of these skills will really be useful. If things don’t go as planned, I might even consider switching to a work permit (my uncle runs an abaya shop there).

👉 For those already living in the UK:

What skills actually helped you the most?

Which ones gave you job opportunities, side hustles, or just made life easier?

If you were in my shoes, what would you focus on learning right now?


I’d really appreciate your suggestions, whether you studied, worked, or settled in the UK. Your advice could help me make the most of my time before moving. 🙏",1,1756749813.0,Britain,2,1.0,False

She was recently working at some coffee shop, ended up meeting this guy (allegedly Muslim, but his actions speak otherwise), she would essentially be dating him while at work because he would stay there for hours while she was working chatting with her and even holding hands. Eventually her brothers and parents found out and in an attempt to break it off sent her to live with her other sister 3 hours away and took away her devices.

She must have still had a secret phone or something because that guy drove to where she was when no one was around and took her and they basically ran away together. This is a major disgrace and embarrassment to our entire family and I do not want any form of contact with this woman, she is disowned as far as I’m concerned. My question is after all this, if I am islamically allowed to ban my wife from speaking to her anymore? My brother is saying it’s against Islam to cut family ties over sins, but I do not want anything to do with this woman and I certainly don’t want her anywhere near my children or wife, I don’t want them to have the idea in their head that you can do whatever you want, your family will be mad for a while but in the end  will just forgive it anyway so no harm.

1n5vudy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1n5vudy/please_give_me_advice/,Please give me advice 🙏,"Hello everyone,
I just wanna get advice please 🙏 two year ago I meet a man,  he’s is 57 rn n in 27 rn, we texting each other when I was 16 n then I deleted my fb, but he never ask me sexual things, he always ask “how’s school etc” everything was fine, after some years I created my new fb account n I saw him on fb,
So I decided to add him as my friend, he add me immediately , we texting on Facebook, he told me am  still to young for him. He’s from USA n am from Eastern Europe (not from war country ), then he told me am to young for him n we can be the friends after some days he still textin me. It was fine you know, he knew everything about me, I had a bad father. 
After some months I really fall in love with him, and he invite me to visit USA, it was fine, he gave me engagement ring n we promised to meet again in some months. I wasn’t ready to stay  bc my work n family. All these months he support me financially.because he don’t wanna make me go to work.
Im here for my second visit for 90 days and i notice he have problems with alcohol n anger issues.
After 3 weeks being in the USA with him he gets really drunk, n then he starts arguing, for literally nothing, he call me Eastern Europe cunt,bitch etc. n I did really nothing.
He throw things. He destroy the lamp, glass,bowls in the kitchen etc.
N this situation repeat every 2-3 weeks.
Today we made nice dinner, we made baked potato with sour cream n some chives + bbq ribs n salad. We harvest that chives in green house, and I asked him if he wash that (bc he wash something in the sink and I wasn’t sure if he wast that chives or not ) n then the all drama started, he call me all the time stupid idiot cunt, he throw on the kitchen floor both plates with that potato n ribs, he destroy everything again. I literally asked him only one question if he Wash that chives n he call me a fucking ignorant. N then he told me some thing like “ go n pack your things you stupid cunt I will call the police n Ice on you I hope they will deport you” he mean immigrants police on me, he also hit me for the first time today.
I don’t really know what should I do, tomorrow he will apologize to me again, he will regret that what he told me, but u know I remember what he told me n I’m really unhappy with this. Every morning I gave him coffee, he drink that then I made him breakfast (eggs +bacon,pancake or sandwich) n after that he starts drinking, ice +juice + rum. My family don’t know this, they don’t know how he act when he gets drunk. He don’t wanna look Bad front of my parents but he dont mind look bad front of me. I really want somebody who will take care of me n never hurt me n I will loge him, no matter age or financial status. That’s it. Every morning after this he apologizes he swear to me he will drink less, n he apologizes, then he buyis me a gifts..
In my home country before him I was really good, I have career in hotels company’s, really good post n salary. I left that because of him. N now I suffer, n I realize I really have better when I was alone in my home country n just go to work everyday. 
N when I veg him for drinking less he told me “ I will buy u ticket n u can go home”
I really wanna be with him, but I really don’t know what should I do. I’m not with him for money or citizenship, I really love him. But I really don’t know what should I do, and I also can’t tell this to my mom or dad.
He also lie to me, he told me he’s divorced n in the end he’s not. It’s almost 7 years what he dint live with her wife but he’s still in marriage. 
He have divorce attorney but his wife don’t want to communicate with him.
I really wanted someone older who will protect me,n love me. I never expected this…
I’m really disappointed… I don’t have anyone to say so maybe someone’s from alllya will give me some advance because Im really desperate… thank you 🙏

1n5vu6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedRiverGorge/comments/1n5vu6k/planning_a_1_night_couples_getaway_hows_this/,"Planning a 1 night couples getaway, how's this itinerary ?","It's my girlfriends birthday next weekend, taking her to Red River Gorge to celebrate it.

Unfortunately we don't have much time, we'll arrive on Sunday evening around 5-6pm and be leaving again Monday night. 

I have a 2pm 2 hour couples thermal spa booked for Monday at The Hive, but everything else still has to be booked.

Really want to get some good hiking done, and underground gorge kayaking and the spa but struggling to fit it all in!

Looking at cabins approx $200 for the night, struggling a little with the 2 night minimum stay many places have. Ideally somewhere central so we don't lose too much time driving. Hot tub essential. Saw some interesting ones in Nada area but maybe too far?

Trying to make the most of it, here's my plan! Unfamiliar with the area so hoping it's realistic. 

Sunday evening, arrive, go for dinner, thinking RedPoint BBQ, would love to do a nice sunset walk/hike before/after (any recommendations?). Then back to the cabin to chill in the hot tub.

Up early Monday morning, straight to Auxier Ridge, Double Arch and Courthouse trail. We're both young and fit, so budgeting 4.5-5 hours to get this done.

Then lunch at Miguel's Pizza around 12pm before hitting the thermal spa at the Hive at 2pm. 

Finished spa at 4pm, get a coffee before heading to the Underground Gorge Kayak tour at 5.30pm.

After that we'll probably get something quick to eat before hitting the road for home.

Thanks to anyone who read all that and offers some advice !

1n5vrwo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n5vrwo,Not your typical full English,"I decided to dig into my first British ORP and funnily enough I grabbed a menu 1. Quite a bit of food in this one but no crackers or bread. Probably a good thing. I did the breakfast burrito filling, coffee, creamer, sugar, plum jam, nibnibs, pineapple drink and the breakfast bar. I added some whole wheat MRE tortillas, avocados and Herdez salsa roja. I added a pic of my heating setup for pouches. I use a smaller pot for the tins. The second pot has water in it to help keep the pouch submerged and I put the tortilla pouch on top of it all to warm. I let it heat about 20 minutes and it came out piping hot. The tortillas were warm and soft like they should be. 

The drinks are plentiful in this ration with several teas, coffees and 2 powdered drinks. I'm looking forward to the cherry since I haven't seen anything cherry flavored here outside of soft drinks and Kool aid if it's still made. The coffee is a standard freeze dried affair and with the creamer and sugar serves it country well. 5/10 for me, nothing to write home about but does the job adequately. The pineapple drink is pretty damn good and went well with the breakfast. It has a nice pineapple flavor and the right amount of sweetness. It's a 8/10 for me.

The breakfast bar is like a huge, honking, super soft oatmeal cookie. It tastes like one too. I love oatmeal cookies but I'm not a big fan of raisins. I'll eat them if they're present but normally avoid them. Grapes are way better and every raisin should learn to moisturize and become grapes again. 7/10 and with the plum jam it kicked up to an 8/10. Speaking of plum jam, it has a nice plum flavor considering that plums generally have a lighter flavor. It's an 8/10. Those nibnibs are fantastic.
A nice crunchy little number with a bit of spice on the back end. These don't need to come to the US. I could eat an entire bag of these without thinking. 9.5/10 and with a bit more heat 10/10. 

This main is thick and hearty in all the right ways. It's like a bean chili and I'm here for it. If you want to save the world eat more beans. Well seasoned and balanced I added the sambal to give it a bit more spice. What an excellent combination and I would welcome this as a meal anytime of the day. I made a few bites (pictured) with a piece of tortilla, the filling, avocado, a nibnib and some salsa roja. 10/10 bite. This is an absolute banger of a main and I highly recommend it. 10/10 for me.

I bought a coffee machine on Vinted and unfortunately there were two spare parts that arrived broken (hot water nozzle and water tank). I would like to point out that it was the transport that broke them because everything was impeccable before. I have photos to support it. The saleswoman is as sorry as I am and offers to reimburse me for the purchase of spare parts (which I hastened to buy because the machine is unusable otherwise).  We're talking about thirty euros, and the seller's proposal is adorable, but I was thinking that maybe I could declare a dispute and ask for a refund of the said parts as part of buyer protection?

1n5vmc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1n5vmc9/uncover_why_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Uncover Why the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Nespresso Vertuo Stands Out,"The Nespresso BNV220CRO1BUC1 has been the centerpiece of my morning routine for weeks, and it has significantly changed how I experience coffee. I’ve tried various coffee machines over the years, but this one offers a sleek design, exceptional brewing versatility, and advanced features that make it feel like having a personal barista in my kitchen. There’s plenty to love about it, as well as a couple of small quirks worth noting, so let’s dive in.

**Sleek and Modern Design**  
The chrome finish on this machine looks incredibly stylish on my countertop. Its compact dimensions (8”D x 12”W x 12”H) are perfect, allowing it to slot into smaller kitchen spaces without feeling intrusive. What I appreciated most was that its removable water tank is cleverly placed, making it easy to refill. Despite its modern look, the design doesn’t sacrifice practicality for aesthetics, which I can’t say for every coffee maker I’ve owned. Buttons located on the unit are straightforward, making it accessible even for a coffee-making rookie.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Stylish chrome design enhances the kitchen aesthetic  
- Compact dimensions fit snugly in smaller spaces  
- User-friendly interface simplifies interaction  

**Versatility That Transforms Your Mornings**  
This machine doesn’t box you into a single style of coffee; instead, it lets you explore. You’ll find five brewing options at your disposal: Alto Coffee, Coffee, Gran Lungo, Double Espresso, and Espresso, all manageable through a single button. Essential for me, this versatility makes it easy to switch up my coffee game depending on the day’s mood. No matter the size or type, it consistently delivers that rich crema that coffee aficionados dream of. Iced coffee lovers will also appreciate that it doubles as an iced coffee maker!  

**Check [Nespresso BNV220CRO1BUC1] price on Amazon.**  

**Performance and Brewing Technology**  
What sets this coffee maker apart from most is its Centrifusion brewing technology. Once you insert a Vertuo capsule and close the lever, the capsule spins at 7,000 RPM, blending the perfect ratio of water and coffee grounds. What’s more, its barcode reading system adjusts brewing parameters automatically based on the capsule, ensuring consistency every single time. This automation impressed me. Unlike my previous machines, there’s no need for manual adjustments or second-guessing whether I’m doing it right.

**Drawbacks**  
- Only works with Vertuo capsules, which limits compatibility with third-party options  
- The capsules can be a bit pricey compared to standard coffee-making alternatives  

**Ease of Operation and Maintenance**  
Operating this espresso machine is shockingly simple for something that feels so high-tech. A single button handles everything, and the machine heats up in just 25 seconds. Being a busy parent, every second counts in the morning, so this feature saves me time without compromising quality. Its automatic shut-off is a nice touch, living up to Nespresso's reputation for energy efficiency. The only downside is emptying the used pod container, which holds a decent amount but fills quicker than I’d hoped due to my excessive coffee habit.

**Rival Brands**  
Compared to the Keurig K-Cafe or the De’Longhi Dedica, the Nespresso machine excels in delivering a more authentic espresso experience. While the Keurig offers versatility with regular coffee grounds and K-cups, it falls short on crema-rich espresso shots. Meanwhile, the De’Longhi Dedica looks equally stylish but lacks the fully automated features and ease of use that come standard here. However, unlike the Keurig, which gives you access to more budget-friendly K-cups, the Nespresso requires you to stick with its proprietary Vertuo capsules, making it a more expensive option over time.

**Value Proposition**  
Without mentioning an exact price, I do feel like the cost of this machine reflects the quality it delivers. From the standout brewing technology to its user-friendly features, it offers a great balance between quality and convenience for coffee enthusiasts. For anyone tired of bland, generic brews or constant visits to pricey coffee shops, this feels like an investment in convenience and superior taste. The included complimentary starter pack of Vertuo capsules also cushions the initial step into using the machine, letting you sample different blends without committing right away.

I’ve been experimenting with natural skincare and thought of creating travel-friendly DIY skincare kits. The idea is to make it super simple to use natural masks/packs when you’re traveling, staying in hostels, or just want a one-time, mess-free option without carrying jars and powders around.

The first combos I’m thinking of are:
	•	🌾 Rice flour + curd (brightening & soothing)
	•	🌿 Moringa powder + milk + turmeric (nourishing)
	•	✨ Turmeric + coffee powder + honey (glow & mild exfoliation)
	•	🫘 Kadala podi / chickpea flour + turmeric + curd (classic natural cleanser)

Packaging idea:
	•	Small drawer-style pack with ingredients in separate, single-use sachets
	•	Includes a tiny mixing compartment, a spoon, and a tissue
	•	Just open → mix → apply, all in one pack

My questions for you:
👉 Would you personally find something like this useful?
👉 Do these combos sound appealing / safe enough for general skin use?
👉 Any suggestions for improving the concept (different combos, packaging style, or must-have add-ons)?

I’d love your feedback 🙏

I went on a 1 and a half day of relaxation. Where? Not a mountain. Not a beach. Not a valley. Not a desert. And certainly not a strip club xD. The perfect relaxation place which is cost friendly and travel worthy is the house of your friend.

1.5 days of chilling with your loved ones, conversing with them on any topic you find lying around and to top it off with, having good food and drinks.

A friend’s house is like your own. You can talk to them, sit silently with your thoughts, go for a walk, doomscroll, make coffee, your own bed and your own cocktails as well. You particularly do not need to blabber on and gossip. Chill, relax, take your own time and leave.

For me, its better than any medicines. You are not feeling good, staying with them will be like using a paracetamol. Have got things to discuss? Gossip with them and it works like a digene. You are depressed and cant sleep? Have some drinks (alcoholic or non-alcoholic), listen to music, and it becomes your prescribed dose of Demerol.

After all this, when you leave, you leave a part of yourself and take something from them as a replacement every time you bid farewell.

To all those, who seek something pure, seek a friend where there are no deals and contracts and you got yourself a great a partner (this works the same when you have a life partner as well, be friends).

All in all, one thing with which I will close this is, being friends does not mean that you always to solve problems, talk to them constantly for hours day after day, or always understand each other. Being friends for me is just the fact of being there. Just a soul in a human’s body lying there with you and forgetting the world around.

We had a very intensely passionate start to our relationship with crazy wild nights, trying party pills, getting drunk a lot together and stuff like that for the first few months which gave us an amazing thrill high. 

After 3-4 months things started getting ugly when started being responsible and reduced the wildness. We were arguing a lot and I fell into the worst depression of my life to a point where I tried to off myself. After that moment we both got significantly scared and took a break from each other. I realised I’ve been suppressing a lot of trauma since I was a child and now I’m severely depressed and I need help. I got on medication, enrolled into wellness programs and going complete sober. It’s helping me a lot and I actually want to continue with this path. He realised he has issues as well and started medication on my request. He is doing significantly better and we’ve been on good terms and finally happy together for the past 2 months. 
Although I no longer feel like I’ll ever heal with him. I love him a lot and really want this to workout but he has decided to continue drinking (he drinks at least 2L of beer in one night) and smoking (5-6 cigs a day) and not doing anything for getting better other than the meds and runs. I completely understand that it’s his choice but he becomes another person when he is drunk and complains about life a lot. He has helped me a lot through my journey and I want to be there for him as well but I just cannot take any more negative energy while I’m struggling to be positive myself. 
I’ve also started craving more affection or tiny happy moments like grabbing ice cream together or going for coffees with my bf but he doesn’t like that stuff and I no longer want to go for drinks. I understand I can give him company while he drinks but I feel like it’ll be really hard for me to trust myself with staying sober under that condition.

Everyone in his life let him down and I’m the only one holding his sanity and faith in place. He will lose his shit if I leave him. I’m his only ever love and the only person he’s ever opened up to. AITAH for thinking about breaking up now that I’m trying to be healthy while he is not?

I have had no complications with my health since  last October I had Scarlett fever which led me to have a horrible strep throat. I was treated with antibiotics. A month later I was diagnosed in the ER with costochondritis. In December, I started having horrible panic attacks that sent me to the ER 3 times. I would get brain fog and like tingly arms and legs before these attacks. My panic attacks stopped in April but I still get anxiety. I would think I’m 70% better however I still have these symptoms.

\-Sudden mild adrenaline surges randomly(gut-drop feeling)

 \-fasting intolerance

 \-exercise intolerance (when I workout too hard even for a minute, I feel sick) 

\-medication sensitivity especially stimulants (I had to retrain myself to drink coffee which does not effect me that much anymore)

 \-neck sensitivity sometimes with swollen lymph notes (one at a time, not everyday) 

\-I still have costochondritis or chest pain. I would say it’s 85% better tho. Thank goodness. (Who even knows it’s costo at this point) 

\-lower BP at 96/80 when before I would be at 115/80. 

\-and now I might have an ulcer bc I can’t tolerate spicy foods but this could have been from anxiety medicine they put me on. (Unrelated but adding this just in case)

I have been to doctors and they label it as “anxiety”. None of the anxiety medicine they gave me helped my symptoms. I have taken BASIC blood work panels and it shows that I have higher inflammation markers. Yet no one addresses this. Of course, I asked chat. Chat told me it could be MCAS or something nervous system related. However, I have no rashes. And cardiologist ruled out POTS.

I had gone up there for the quiet and the view, thinking a couple of nights in the cold would be a nice break from the busy campgrounds down lower. The first night was peaceful. I cooked some soup on my little stove, read by lantern light, and fell asleep under three blankets with the kind of silence you only get that far out.

The second morning though, I woke up to discover that my sliding van door was completely frozen shut. I could see the frost on the inside seams, like the van had grown its own icicles overnight. At first, I laughed it off. I thought, no big deal, I’ll just push it a little harder. But no matter how much I shoved or pulled, that door wasn’t moving. My only way out at that point was through the front passenger door, which isn’t the most graceful exit when you’re half-asleep and still wrapped in blankets.

It got even funnier when I realized I had parked just close enough to a snowbank that squeezing out was like crawling through a freezer. I remember sitting in the driver’s seat afterward, red-faced from the cold, thinking, this is the part nobody shows you in the Instagram reels. The freedom is real, but so are the frozen doors and clumsy scrambles into the snow at seven in the morning.

Eventually, I poured some warm water along the seam and managed to crack the door free, but it left me thinking about all the little challenges van life throws at you that you don’t expect. You can plan and prepare for so much, but sometimes the adventure comes in the form of a stuck door reminding you to stay flexible and keep a sense of humor.

That morning I made coffee, sat watching the steam rise into the cold air, and thought about how these unglamorous moments are the ones I’ll probably remember the most years from now.

Do you all have those kinds of stories? The ones where something went a little sideways, and instead of ruining the day, it became one of those memories that sticks with you?",4,1756748659.0,VanLife,4,0.83,False

I’m ready to quit (again) tomorrow, and wanted to share my story, my plan, and a few fears. Reading your posts gives me a sense of kinship, and I hope mine might invite a little of that support back.

I’m in my fifties, female, and started smoking at 14—partly because it was still normal and even cool back then, but also because of things I didn’t understand at the time. Later I was diagnosed with ADHD (cigs + coffee probably helped me manage symptoms) and PTSD (with autonomic nervous system issues like very low blood pressure). Smoking became both coping mechanism and comfort. It was also tied to love: my grandmother and great-grandmother, whom I adored, always smoked. Even some of my favorite professors smoked in class.

So I was primed emotionally and physically for addiction, and I was hooked right away. Over time, as smoking became less social, my habit grew solitary and ritualized: I can only smoke sitting alone, with coffee, soda, or wine. That doesn’t mean I smoke less—if anything, the rituals keep me always planning for the next one, often two at a time.

I’ve quit successfully before. During my pregnancies I quit for years, and I quit again 11 years ago for over a decade. But each relapse came with major stress. Last year, surrounded by smokers during a hard time, I picked it up again.

What I’ve learned about myself:
	1.	The psychological addiction is stronger than the physical one. Shame or intense pressure makes me smoke more.
	2.	Cold turkey works better than tapering, NRT, or Wellbutrin. NRT makes it harder to quit. It seems to confuse my body- “are we quitting or not? “
	3.	I usually gain 10–15 pounds when I quit. Chocolate and junk food enter the picture. 

Here’s the plan this time:
	1.	Quit day is tomorrow. I’ve worked with my doctor and therapist for accountability.
	2.	Smoking my last pack today. No cigs tomorrow.
	3.	Started Chantix yesterday (late, but hoping it helps cravings).
	4.	I arranged 2 weeks WFH and blocked mornings so I have space if I feel awful.
	5.	Refilled my Adderall and stocked coffee so I’m not compounding cravings.
	6.	Bought Allen Carr’s audiobook again—something about it helped me before.
	7.	I know I need new “breaks.” Smoking is tied to writing, art, and work. This time I’ll try to swap in music, maybe pick up an old instrument or even take a class. I’ve noticed errands distract me too, so I’ll lean on that.

TL;DR: Middle-aged, smoking since 14, quit several times, relapsed last year. Tomorrow is quit day again. I shared my story, my plan, and my fears. Grateful for this community.

The idea is to create one-time-use packs that are easy to carry, especially for people staying in hostels, traveling, or anyone who prefers natural skincare but doesn’t want to carry big bottles/pouches.

Our first combo kits would include:

	•	A small mixer cup compartment will be inside the cover.
	•	A mixing spoon and a tissue will also be included.
	•	You just open, mix directly in the packaging cover, and apply.

The idea is to make natural DIY skincare easy, mess-free, and travel-friendly.

For example I have audiotechnica MX50s headphones, which are budget audiophile closed back headphones but sound great to me. I bought this soundbar package when we bought the house and got a 85"" samsung qled TV. The soundbar sounds good, but the bass is pushed to its limits and doesnt really have any ""punch"" to it. Its almost like the bass sounds artificial if that makes sense.

Anyways, I was wondering if I could add some bookshelf speakers to the soundbar system and replace the sub with something of better quality? Do I need one of those audio control boxes (Dont know the proper term) as well to power and control everything? 

Without the processing unit, Id like to be under 500$ for a pair or bookshelf speakers, maybe even a pair of rear wifi speakers behind the couch too for that same ballpark price? Then for the sub, I have no idea what is a decent price per investment but maybe $500 max for the sub? I guess all in I would like to spend no more than 1k. My biggest gripe is the sub and its bass. I think additional bookshelf speakers would sound nice, as we host parties and watch movies so the added audio would be nice, I think. The rear speakers are the least of my concern so a 3 channel setup with soundbar for center and bookshelf L/R and sub would be great. The soundbar sounds much better than the TV audio so not too much concern replacing it, but I would like to add to it, if that makes sense.

If it makes sense to sell the samsung setup (Soundbar/sub) and buy a new configuration, I wouldnt mind some recommendation on that as well. It is a single family home on a corner lot so not too much concern for neighbors and loud noise as they are either young and understand or old retired but nice people and friendly. 

Below is the general layout of the living room. To the left is the kitchen and not actually a wall. The right side with the deco chair is a wall to the patio and the TV is along the wall that neighbors the master bedroom. The TV console spans 80"" so there is space to add two bookshelf speakers on it, or I can purchase stands to be left/right of the TV console. The sub is actually in a cubby hole in the TV console and not next to it like shown. The couch can come off the wall a bit to fit some rear speakers for a 5 channel setup.

  
Thanks!

* Mayfair Pens: Noldor model, ""Papillon"" resin by turnt pen co.
* Carolina Pen Co:  Charleston model, ""Exquisite Quartz"" resin
* Pilot: Vanishing Point, white with black trim ""Storm Trooper""

Bought some inks (and got some for free):

* Colorverse: San Francisco Fog (show exclusive ink)
* Sailor: 2025 Pen Show Exclusive
* Amarillo Stationery: Urng Kicks
* Nagasawa: Kobe Akashi Museum Gold
* Nagasawa: Kobe Akanegumo ""sunset of that day""
* Nagasawa: choose your own 5 ink mini set (Suma Purple, Tamon Kakitsubota, Sengari Water Blue, Nunobiki Emerald, Suwayama Leaf Green)
* Kiwi Ink: Rainbow in a Bottle 2.0
* Kiwi Ink: Scented Jasmine
* Nahvalur: Napa Red (free)
* Platinum: Chou Kuro (free)

I couldn't resist and had to swatch up the inks as soon as I got home. Swatches are on Iroful paper.

I managed to snag an appointment with Kirk Speer of pen realm, who ground an Imperial and a cursive smooth italic for me. He even worked his magic on my old Lamy 2K that has never written well for me and now glides like butter on the page. He was even running ahead of schedule! Very pleased and eager to try these grinds out.

I didn't manage to get an appointment with Gena (those appointment drops are BRUTAL), but I dropped off a pen with them. They were super kind and managed to squeeze in a Journaler grind on my TCMC Estie for me in between their other appointments. Very excited to ink this one up!

I even met some of my favorite YouTubers: Blake (Papermind and Blake's Broadcast) and Drew Brown (Fahrney's Pens)! I loved trying out the paper at the Papermind table and chatting with Blake about the merits of each paper type. Drew is just as cool and kind in person as he is online, so fun to meet him in person!

The crowds were intense, definitely not an event for those with claustrophobia. For those attending locally or staying the San Francisco, I highly recommend taking public transit to attend. Millbrae station was an easy 15 minute walk from the hotel. There's even a Starbucks near the station that was MUCH less busy than fighting for coffee at the Westin.

Overall, a truly incredible first pen show for me. I'll surely be back in future years. Now I'm going to retreat from this sub for a few months to let my budget recover from the hangover.

Detailed Review,"Testing out the Jura 15646 E8 Chrome Espresso Machine has been nothing less than a caffeine-fueled journey of discovery. As a coffee enthusiast obsessed with trying various espresso machines, the allure of this high-performance espresso maker, capable of brewing 17 different beverages with a single button push, was impossible to ignore. It’s been an immersive experience that left me impressed, but there are a few wrinkles worth discussing.

**Sleek and Modern Design that Blends Right In**

From the moment I unboxed it, the Jura E8's sleek chrome finish and compact dimensions—standing at 11"" x 17.6"" x 13.8""—grabbed my attention. It effortlessly fits on my kitchen counter alongside other appliances without consuming unnecessary space. The brand’s commitment to quality craftsmanship is apparent, and the clean, minimalistic design looks stunning amidst any décor. While I appreciated the overall premium aesthetic, its weight of 22 pounds made moving it a bit cumbersome. Not an issue once it’s set in place, but worth thinking about if you rearrange your setup often.

**User-Friendly Interface with Intuitive Controls**

Using the machine is practically idiot-proof, thanks to its beautiful 3.5-inch color display. The six operating buttons make navigating options as straightforward as ordering a drink from your local barista. Whether it was my own use or when my not-so-tech-savvy uncle decided to give it a shot, the operations felt natural and intuitive. The on-screen Cockpit display is visually appealing and made every brewing option crystal clear. There’s virtually no learning curve here, which is a major plus if you’re hosting guests or sharing the machine with family.

[Check Jura 15646 E8 Chrome price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0d3jhbdhl/)

**Coffee Customization Taken to the Next Level**

The ability to prepare 17 distinct beverages was something that could easily rival my nearby coffeehouse. From espressos to cappuccinos and even lattes, every drink caters to a variety of tastes in my household. The customization settings for cup size and brew strength allowed me to find the perfect balance, tailored exactly how I like it. My roommate, who prefers ridiculously strong espresso, had no trouble dialing in his preferences. While these options elevate the coffee experience, I couldn’t help but notice the lack of a manual bypass for pre-ground coffee—potentially a downside for fans of decaf or specialty blends.

**Advanced Grinder and Brewing Precision**

Let’s talk about the grinder because, wow, it’s a game-changer. The P.A.G.2 grinder ensures beans are freshly ground for every preparation, maintaining the highest level of flavor and aroma. With an ergonomic selector switch, adjustment was a breeze, allowing me to tweak grind settings based on coffee type. Between each brew, the grinder cleverly goes into a rest mode, prolonging its lifespan. Combine that with the eighth-generation 3D brewing unit, and the coffee was full-bodied, rich, and exactly how I imagine espresso should taste. My only gripe? The grinder noise is noticeable, especially during early mornings when everyone else in the house is still asleep.

**One-Touch Milk System Cleaning That’s Almost Magical**

Cleaning up after brewing a milk-based coffee has always been a chore, but Jura took care of that seamlessly. Pressing a button to initiate the milk system cleaning process is a lifesaver. The automatic clean is swift and eliminates the heavy-duty scrubbing I’ve grown far too accustomed to with other machines. Even my sister, who avoids making lattes out of fear of cleaning milk frothers, felt at ease. That said, the drip tray design, though convenient, does feel like it requires emptying more often than I would prefer.

**Boons**

- Effortless coffee customization with 17 beverage options
- Sleek, space-saving, and premium chrome design  
- Advanced P.A.G.2 grinder ensures freshly ground beans every time  
- User-friendly 3.5-inch color display with intuitive controls  
- Quick and automated milk system cleaning  

**Areas of Concern**

- Noticeable grinder noise, especially in quieter settings  
- Drip tray may require frequent emptying  
- No manual bypass for pre-ground coffee  

**Competing Products**

While I adore this espresso machine, others like the De'Longhi Magnifica or Breville Barista Pro come to mind. The Jura E8 stands out for its unparalleled coffee variety and cutting-edge grinder but falls short in areas like grinder noise. Machines like the Breville Barista Pro allow more manual control with quieter operations, which might attract the tinkerers among coffee lovers. On the other hand, the De’Longhi Magnifica is slightly bulkier yet more budget-friendly while still delivering high-quality espresso.

Compared to competitors, the Jura E8 excels in automation and design but could offer more flexibility and quieter grinding. If customization and simplicity are your priorities, this machine is a winner.

**Best Value**

Talking about its worth, the Jura E8 commands a higher price tag, but it’s arguably justified considering the premium-quality design, advanced grinder, and beverage variety. That said, if you’re someone who isn’t willing to compromise on coffee automation and customization, investing in this espresso machine feels like smart spending. While there are cheaper alternatives, few deliver the same level of precision combined with ease of use.

He constantly forgets it even though I remind him as I grab mine. Sometimes He still chooses not to bring it saying “I’ll be fine I don’t need it” even though we are going to a sporty activity or a long road trip where he will need water. He then finishes mine in .2 seconds and I’m pissed cause then I have to chug water when I get home to make sure I get a good intake for the day.

I’m a coffee addict like I’ll get really bad migraines if I don’t have enough shortly after waking up. Today we went on a brunch date and both got coffee and a meal. He downed tf out of his coffee and took a swig of mine and I told him to stop as he’s already tried it this cup.  He bugged off and then did it again twice as we were getting ready to leave. I got pissed and said stuff along the lines of why didn’t he just order another one for himself? He doesn’t even like the coffee I drink he likes the fruity girly pop drinks. Anyways. He’s not talking to me now (pretty common) idk what to do or how to make him understand that I hate sharing my drinks. I feel I’ve already expressed it.",1,1756748250.0,relationshipadvice,1,1.0,False

**Rent:** $4,200/ Month

Hello! My wife and I are subletting our beloved apartment in the heart of the **Lower East Side** — just one block from the **Delancey/Essex FMJZ subway stop** — and we’re looking for someone to enjoy it while we temporarily relocate for work.

We’ve lived here together for 4 years (and I’ve called this home for over 9!). It’s truly a gem: full of character, flooded with light, and perfectly located to take advantage of everything downtown Manhattan has to offer. We’re only moving because my wife, a special education teacher, accepted a position in Connecticut for the upcoming school year.

We have a great relationship with our long-term landlord and are looking for responsible tenants to sublet while we’re away. Here’s what makes the apartment special:

* **2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom** in a classic **pre-war walk-up** (2nd floor – just one straight flight up!)
* **King-size primary bedroom** fits a king bed, dresser, two nightstands, desk, and an armchair — plus a large closet with overhead storage
* **Second bedroom** fits a queen bed and dresser, has a deep closet — could also be used as a **home office or guest room**
* **Spacious living/dining room** fits a 6-person dining table, sectional sofa, armchairs, coffee table, and TV console
* **Updated kitchen** that is getting **brand new countertops** next week with tons of cabinetry, a dedicated pantry, and newer appliances (all replaced within the last 4 years)
* Bathroom will be getting **brand new tile** next week, as well
* **High ceilings** and **southeast-facing windows** that flood the apartment with natural light
* **Window planters** outside the living room — perfect for growing herbs or seasonal flowers!
* Only **1 block from the Delancey/ Essex FMJZ** subway stop, and right in the middle of the best restaurants, bars, shopping, and entertainment the city has to offer
* Within **5-10 minute walking distance** of Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, Essex Market, and Union Market
* **Laundromat** right across the street
* Will be unfurnished
* No pets

Please DM me if interested and we can set up a video chat tour. Note that we will be asking for one month's rent, security deposit (equal to one month's rent), background/ credit check through SmartMove ($47 fee), proof of income (most recent pay stubs), and sublease agreement to secure the apartment.",9,1756748046.0,NYCapartments,8,1.0,False

Tired of endless swiping and surface-level chats? Me too. I’m here hoping to find something real—a genuine connection with someone who’s as excited about life as I am.

Imagine this: spontaneous road trips with the windows down, deep conversations over coffee that last until sunrise, and laughter so contagious it leaves us both breathless. If you’re passionate about making the most of every moment and believe that life is better when shared, we might just be on the same wavelength.

A bit about me:
I’m an honest, straightforward guy with a healthy dose of curiosity and a knack for adventure. Average height, brown hair, and someone who loves staying active—whether it’s hitting the gym, hiking a new trail, or diving into a friendly game (sports or video!). I’m financially secure and believe in giving back, always ready to lend a hand or brighten someone’s day.

If you’re an animal lover, you’ll have to forgive me for stopping to greet every dog or cat we meet—bonus points if you do the same! 🐾

What I'm looking for:
Someone who values authenticity, open communication, and a relationship built on mutual respect. I believe the best connections are rooted in honesty, effort, and a willingness to truly listen. If you’re ready for meaningful conversations, shared adventures, and a partnership where both people show up, I’d love to get to know you.

I believe in grand gestures, spontaneous road trips, and late-night conversations under the stars. When I’m not gaming or planning my next outing, you’ll find me taking care of myself—hitting the gym, going for a run, or just enjoying a peaceful walk to clear my mind.

Looking for someone who’s up for co-op missions (in games and in life), believes in romance, and isn’t afraid to chase after what makes their heart race. If you love laughter, adventure, and a little bit of old-fashioned charm, let’s write our own story. 

If you’re only here for fleeting chats or aren’t ready for genuine connection, that’s totally okay—just not what I’m after. But if you’re ready to build something real, let’s see where this journey takes us. Swipe right on life, and let’s create our own story!

1n5v3ls,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1n5v3ls/aitah_for_refusing_to_stop_dancing_on_my_date_at/,AITAH for refusing to stop dancing on my date at a wedding?,"Me (24 yr. old woman) and my date (25 yr. old man). I’ve known my date for over 7 years and we used to date back in high school. I would also like to preface the groom at the wedding went to our school as well, so it’s not like I didn’t know anyone at the wedding, but my date. I was already anxious for this wedding since I was not receiving any prior information till the day of (times, locations, etc.). I didn’t want to go at this point since I felt like I wasn’t wanted/being included. I worked a full day and rushed home to get ready. Gave myself a pep talk in the car and was like, ‘Let’s just try to have a good time, it’s not about you.’ 

I get there and my date meets me downstairs and we head up to the reception and grab a drink. Things are going GOOD. There’s a table in the back corner by a speaker where we decide to stand. Everyone said their speech, cut the cake, and the fun starts (or so I thought). The music starts to play and I’m not exactly sure what song was on — just a typical wedding song — and I was like “Dance with me!” I pulled him close, put my hands around his shoulders, so both of our bodies were touching. I start moving my waist back and forth against his and my date laughed and was like ‘Stop it’. At first, I thought he was joking. And he kept telling me to stop I’m like, Why? Aren’t you supposed to dance at weddings? We’re in the corner, not in the center of the dance floor and I’m not throwing ass or anything like that? I did eventually stop and my date argues it went on for more than 5 minutes, but I don’t know if he’s exaggerating because it felt like less than a minute to me, but we were both lit so who knows.

Next morning in the car back home I took him to get some coffee. He started laughing over something and wouldn’t tell me what it was about — I tell this man everything. I got mad because I received a tip about him doing drugs a few weeks before and I’m like what else is he not telling me? I brought it up and he proceeds to lie straight to my face and keeps up the act until I present him with a white lie saying his friend told me at the wedding, then he confessed. He just didn’t want me to know about the drugs because it was ‘embarrassing.’ —
This is when he brings up my DANCING… He was like you ruined the wedding. Word for word: “If you were anybody else I would have NEVER talked to you again. You doing that made me re-think our entire relationship together.” Goes on to say how I needed to ‘know’ my audience since there were older and religious folks there (btw I’m a Christian too). He was so worried about other people watching us and judging us. I really didn’t think people were watching, I mean we’re just guests at a wedding. Goes on to say we need to make sacrifices for each other — that’s what relationships are about (that heated me because I know all about sacrifices, I went to court for this man and delt with legal issues for my entirety of my college experience because I took the blame). I’m like did anyone say anything to you about it? No, but apparently the grooms dad made a little side comment like ‘look at y’all’ or ‘calm down,’ something along those lines while we were dancing (I personally don’t remember this). I was like are you joking, I thought my dancing was fine, but if he’s lame I should have respected him asking me to stop, but AITAH?! I was unapologetic at first until he described more about his perspective and apologized later on. I still couldn’t stop thinking about how my dancing was so BAD he wouldn’t want to peruse a relationship with me. We talked and hashed it out again later on and we ended up being good.



ANYWHO… so the real twist… he invited me to another wedding! I know some folks at this wedding as well and I even mentioned, ‘Yay, a redemption wedding.’ I’ve gone out of my way to get an outfit for the car ride, wedding dress for the reception, new shoes, wax, spray tan, literally everything you can think of to make sure everything goes perfect this time. He told me once he moved back we can start dating (but he’s like I want to do it the right way and take you out on a date). I even wrote him a letter telling him I want a fresh start — bringing back the butterflies we first had and leaving all the shit in the past. 

We end up going on date — that I picked and made a reservation to (he pays) and bam, nothing. After church I was pestering him why? He goes word for word: “Fine, if you really want to know I’m waiting to see how you act at this wedding! I need to gather enough evidence to see if you’ll make the same mistake again. I just want you to be yourself.” Well, I was myself at the last wedding and look where that got me. At this point I feel like I shouldn’t even go to this wedding. He said I would be a pussy if I don’t though. I was already stressed as it is and this overall feels like punishment in my opinion. I mean AITAH for my awful dancing?! 

I would love all your thoughts and comments — the redemption wedding is this Saturday… :) ",2,1756747948.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

if any miracles exist the only one i can think of is that im still (barely) alive after battling survival for so long 
(countless near death experiences due to dehydration hypothermia starvation sheer exhaustion u name it)

 considered ending it before this winter because the previous winters were so gruelling and traumatic.  
already looking like a zombie either way from the ptsd.  

Been praying and repenting + deliverance for so long every day yet doesnt seem Jesus cares in the slightest.

not even a shower , washing machine access or new socks/clothes for many months now.

im unsure why the punishment is so severe.
i do my best to support all people.  never touched drugs/alcohol/cigs not even coffee im as sober as it gets.

Because honestly—I did NOT expect what I found.

Apps. For. Cash.  
I thought it was some hyped-up urban legend or a sketchy, too-good-to-be-true fairytale... until, boom, *reality check*—a real gig where you don’t need to be an expert, coder, or even that tech-savvy.

Here’s what literally MOVED MY BRAIN recently:

- Yup, people get *paid* to use apps before anyone else. Actual dollars.  
- NO EXPERIENCE NEEDED. I thought I’d need an engineering degree. I was wrong.  
- Testers do the fun part—just tapping around, giving feedback, sharing what feels weird or awesome.

(**Beta tester = the cool kid trying the toys before the rest of us**)

So here's how it works (& how to try it for yourselves):

**1. Sign up on platforms that connect companies with testers. Not all are legit, but this one's FOR REAL — [**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

**2. After you apply, you’ll get invited to test actual apps—scroll, play around, answer simple surveys about your experience. Seriously. That easy.**

HOLD ON, IT GETS WEIRDER.

I was skeptical, but reading reviews from people who started this side hustle just for fun—but now cover Netflix subscriptions, pizza nights, even sneakers—reminded me how powerful these tiny gigs can be.

- No stiff interview process.  
- No resume-building stress.  
- Just honest opinions = cash.

I mean, imagine telling your friends:  
“Yeah, I get paid to try out an app before launch. It’s like being a secret agent, but with coffee money.”

It’s not going to replace a FT gig, to be real.  
But a few tests can give you mad phone money, Starbucks runs, or fund that random Amazon wishlist item.

Wondering where to start?  
Don’t get lost in scammy links (I’ve already wasted hours. IYKYK…)  
Instead, check THIS [**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)—it's where most beta gigs are posted and super beginner-friendly.

Real talk:

- No, these aren’t million-dollar overnight paydays... but getting cash for feedback is wild.  
- No, you won’t need to memorize 900 passwords.  
- You WILL have a blast exploring unreleased stuff before your friends even know about them.

I tested my first app through [**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**](https://goodnovel.org/testapp), and when the payout hit my account, I was GENUINELY confused.  
For once, that “get paid to…” promise was actually true.

And if my previously skeptical self can get started, so can you.

Ready to try? Last time, here’s where you jump in: [**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**](https://goodnovel.org/testapp) 

So, anybody here had wild beta-testing experiences? Might swap stories down in the comments.

I have only ever sold my products to my bar regulars and friends and family, and sometimes I get big orders from friends of friends, for example one of them is a realtor that buys 15-20 ish every two months or so for clients that he closes on homes for, both bought and sold. All other sales are friends/family/bar regulars buying a candle here and there for someone for a special occasion. I also do seasonal candles as well. I did register an LLC.

My candles are nice, I use quality ingredients that are non-toxic, therapeutic grade, and are not cheap. I've never advertised them or marketed them [online] in any way but now that I've just graduated nursing school, I'm thinking of doing so for a while until my residency begins in a few months to make ends meet. 

I looked around on the app for a few days, tons of candles on there but how do I know if the candle market specifically is saturated? I can find several hundred listings of any given product I searched for, like taylor swift t-shirts, jewelry, personalized tumblers/coffee mugs, obviously candles, so how do I know if it's worth it to list mine too? 

Thanks in advance for your advice/insight.",0,1756747712.0,EtsySellers,0,0.5,False

Rent, utilities, internet, furniture, random Target runs, it feels like a second class on top of my actual classes. Back home I watched relatives get buried by credit card debt, so I’ve always been cautious. Now I’m here trying to track coffees, snacks between lectures, textbooks, groceries, and a new Ameren bill I didn’t plan for. Living alone adds up fast, but it’s the trade-off for peace.

The good thing is I’ve been keeping a close budget and I already have solid credit, which honestly makes life a lot easier. Still, I don’t want to start digging a hole before my first year is done. A couple of people told me about debit cards that build credit, so you only spend what you actually have, which seems more my speed while I’m figuring this all out.

Anyone here using one of those & did it really help your score? Any fees or weird limits I should know? Also, local tips would help a ton: best way to keep utilities down once winter hits, internet in Campustown/Urbana that doesn’t suck, whether Aldi or Meijer is the smarter grocery play, textbook hacks, or even budget systems that actually stick.

I’m already riding the MTD with my i card to avoid Uber costs, cooking more to cut Green Street spending, and setting a weekly cap for “fun” money so I don’t burn cash by week two. Would love to hear what worked for you here.

1n5ux1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Environmentalism/comments/1n5ux1s/climate_guilt/,Climate guilt,"I’ve always cared about the environment since I was little, but as I’m going into my last year of college in Environmental Science, I’m learning a lot more about real-world impacts of climate change and this administration is highlighting the harms more clearly than ever. I always used to be interested in bringing my reusable cup when I went to coffee shops, going into a restaurant rather than taking the drive-thru, etc. But over the past couple of months I’ve become a lot more hopeless around taking actions like this. I don’t really know how to explain it, like I’ve cared about these issues for a while but it’s just starting to take a toll on me mentally the past couple of months.

The scale that plastic exists at, bringing my reusable cup to a coffee shop doesn’t really do anything. When it comes down to it, any way that I partake in capitalism, I’m pretty much harming the environment and contributing to social injustices that further exacerbate environmental harms. Even just by existing as someone who participates in a capitalistic society, I’m harming the environment. Like the moment a human is born, they are a reason why the Earth is the way it is because our society keeps training people to only care about money and selfishly getting rich. So I know that we don’t choose to be born into a society who doesn’t really care about the environment, regardless of the amount of greenwashing-type claims that exist, but by participating in it, I just feel so guilty. We should’ve listened to the indigenous peoples, cultures, and practices that existed harmoniously for the environment for thousands of years before the “white man” came along, we should be considering other types of economic systems, etc.

On another topic, as I’m figuring out what I want to do for my career, I thought environmental science careers would be a lot more impactful. Working for the government has so much red tape and the ability to get anything done changes with each administration. If I work in consulting, I think it could be interesting but I don’t just want to keep approving land permits in places where there’s urban sprawl and we shouldn’t even be developing any more. If I work in sustainability, I’ll probably just be helping a corporation greenwash and make their environmental impact seem less than it actually is. And I feel like policies are the only way that climate improvements will be made, but for example, if I get into environmental lobbying right now, no one will care at all what I’m trying to lobby for because trump doesn’t gaf about the planet and no amount of lobbying will change that. If I get into environmental law, I have to choose between working for an NGO with garbage wages and within a broken system, or defending corrupt companies if I actually want to make decent money.

I’ve always worried whether people will start to care about climate change soon enough. But recently it’s been taking a huge toll on my mental health and I can’t stop thinking about all of this pretty much all day long. I literally finished my environmental science internship with a renewable energy company a few weeks ago and during the whole summer, I was still worried that regardless of what job I take within environmental science, I’ll never actually be contributing to environmental improvements if I operate within a corporate setting (even if it is a renewable energy company). 

I guess the point of this post is that, I know a lot of other people struggle with climate guilt, so how do you manage to not let it consume you? I feel like I bounce back and forth between being hyper-eco-friendly in my personal life and practices and then not really caring how much plastic I use, for example, because I get hopeless about how minute of a difference that is. Or does anyone have good book recommendations about the climate, social justice, or indigenous culture/history so that I can explore some of these topics more? I’m open to any general advice. I’d like to help myself realize what’s going on in the world without feeling the need to have personal guilt for the entire climate crisis.",5,1756747559.0,Environmentalism,2,1.0,False

The coffees I make at home are all made with the Stanley camp pour over.  My coffee at work is made with the Stanley traveling french press.  Both use stainless filters.  Yes I get some fines in the bottom of my cups but I use a sieve to remove most of the fines when I grind the beans.  It also allows most of the oils into he brew.  I enjoy the added flavor. 

I usually grind enough for 3 or 4 days and keep the ground coffee in a glass airtight container.  I portion out my morning and work coffee into the little silver containers the night before.  I measure my grounds and water by weight (grams) and both methods I use the same amount of ground coffee.  If I know there won't be any hot water I will fill a thermos with boiling water and take the French Press and be on my way.  

It's a simple, inexpensive setup that allows me to enjoy a hot coffee anywhere.  ",5,1756747491.0,coffeestations,2,1.0,False

If you have classes in ABB or BSB basements, LEAVE EARLY. those rooms are complicated to find, especially BSB's 2nd basement. 

The tim's line is quick but probably not worth it, if you're looking for hot coffee/tea, it will be faster to go into piazza for it. Go to the grind! Supports students and local companies. 

GO TO OFFICE HOURS!!! like my profs were so sweet and helpful when I had questions, they (usually) want to help you succeed. Also, use your TAs, they are paid to help you. 

Find a study method that works for you. For me, its listening to notes, so I get word to speak notes to me. Explore methods until you find one that motivates you. Another is studying in a public place so everyone can see your computer, which forces me to work because i am embarrassed about playing solitaire instead of studying. 

DO NOT buy textbooks until your prof has specifically told you you need it in CLASS. Look on marketplace, Ebay and kijiji before buying a copy at the campus store, as it will be cheaper. Also, many books are available online as PDFs. 

Go to all activities you can and try to join an intramural, its a great way to meet people and get involved. I strongly recommend going to club events and faculty events! 

Everyone is just as nervous and lonely as you, even if it doesn't seem like it. Be open to meeting people and don't be shy, tell them their outfit is nice! Talk to someone new in class! 

Go outside and be active every day, even for just a 10 minute walk to get a coffee. It will help, I promise. Feel lonely and awful? go outside, if that doesn't work, take a nap. 

If you are just going to sit on your phone and watch tiktoks, go somewhere besides your bedroom. Go to a common room, Library, outside, anything. It will make you feel better and less useless lol

Chat time and the grind only take credit and debit cards, not meal plans. 

If you need them, Sign up for SAS accommodations ASAP!! they are very helpful.

1n5utjd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n5utjd,Study of The Silly™ Creature,"Greetings I have come with yet another investigation update, as some of you remember, I found an underground facility underneath the school and found a Silly™ room, and incidentally one of the tiny creatures there followed me on the way back to the lab. As such, I finally decided to start studying it!

Subject: Special Weekend.

- The subject is the size of about one apple and a half, with its most defining feature being its incredibly disproportionate head, as it is rather large compared to its overall body mass. This imbalance results in impaired locomotion, the subject is prone to frequent loss of equilibrium, often stumbling or falling under the weight of its own cranial structure. Its limbs provide negigible utility, as their arms lack the tensile strength for basic defense or object manipulation beyond the lightest of coffee mugs, while its tiny legs are incapable of sustained or rapid ambulation, making them useless for running.

A notable physiological anomaly is the subject's comically elastic skin, even if you accidentally step on it (Which I did not do by the way) it will simply spring back into its normal composition and giggle it off. While it is not the best defense mechanism long term, its squishy cheeks are quite addicting to the touch. (According to a friend)

Cognitive testing places the subject's operational intelligence significantly below the human average, roughly equivalent to a 3 year old child, It demonstrates competency in basic pattern recognition, successfully sorting objects by color and simple shape. However, it displays a profound inability to process numerical concepts or engage in basic math. I deem their problem solving skills to be lower than a Raven.

Special Weekend is a benign, albeit perplexing, entity. Its combination of severe physical handicaps and minimal cognitive function renders it utterly defenseless and non-viable in any uncontrolled environment. It is more accurately classified as a ""small animal"" than an actual Uma.

Despite this, it presents behaviour similar to its look alike. For instance: Keeping this thing alive has dramatically increased my food expenses, it's just like having the real Special Week as a pet!

As for the inside of the subject, there are a number of interesting particularities about its anatomy. Namely: A lack of skeletal structure (still don't know how this works), a small, smooth brain (to no one's surprise) and a BIG heart filled with hopes and dreams. (lol)

BUT, do you notice something weird? It seems to be filled with... Something, I had felt like I had seen something like this before. But I couldn't tell where...

Enter the third image.

What does this mean? Why does this creature's insides match the insides of a carat? I can't make any sense of this at all, the moment I saw this it shocked me beyond belief. From today onwards I will start conducting extensive research of The Silly™ creatures.

Stay safe.

But journaling is a powerful and versatile tool used by everyone from artists and writers to entrepreneurs and athletes. At its heart, journaling is simply the practice of putting your thoughts and feelings onto paper (or a screen) to gain clarity, reduce stress, and track your personal growth. It is a quiet, personal conversation with yourself that can change your life in profound ways.



# The Transformative Benefits of Journaling



A consistent journaling habit can lead to a host of positive outcomes for your mental and emotional well-being:

* **Mental Clarity:** It helps you sort through a jumble of thoughts and emotions, making sense of complex situations.
* **Stress and Anxiety Reduction:** Writing down your worries can help you get them out of your head and onto the page, making them feel more manageable.
* **Goal Setting and Tracking:** Journaling provides a space to outline your goals, brainstorm ideas, and track your progress over time.
* **Emotional Regulation:** It helps you identify emotional triggers and understand your reactions, giving you greater control over your responses.
* **Improved Memory:** Writing things down can help solidify memories and new information.



# How to Start Your Journaling Practice



The beauty of journaling is that there are no rules. It's your space to be authentic and honest. If you're ready to start, here’s a simple, no-pressure guide:

Step 1: Choose Your Tool

You don't need a fancy leather-bound notebook. You can use:

* **A simple notebook and pen:** This is the most popular choice as it offers a tactile experience and is free from digital distractions.
* **A digital app or document:** Use a note-taking app on your phone, a word document, or a dedicated journaling app. This is great for those who prefer to type and want to keep their entries private with a password.

Step 2: Find Your Time and Place

Find a quiet time and space where you won't be interrupted. Even five to ten minutes a day is a great start. This could be first thing in the morning with your coffee, during your lunch break, or right before bed. Consistency is more important than duration.

Step 3: Just Write—Don’t Overthink It

This is the most crucial step. Don't worry about grammar, spelling, or writing a perfect, elegant entry. Just let the thoughts flow from your mind to the page. If you're feeling stuck, you can simply write, ""I don't know what to write about today."" This simple act often opens the door for more thoughts to follow.

Step 4: Use Prompts (If You're Feeling Stuck)

If you're unsure where to begin, prompts can be a helpful guide.

* What are you grateful for today?
* What is one thing you learned today?
* What is on your mind right now?
* What is one small thing you can do to make tomorrow better?
* What is a recent challenge you faced, and how did you handle it?

Step 5: Experiment with Different Styles

As you become more comfortable, you can explore different types of journaling:

* **Gratitude Journaling:** Focus on what you are thankful for each day.
* **Bullet Journaling:** Use a structured format to track tasks, habits, and goals.
* **Stream-of-Consciousness:** Write without stopping for a set amount of time to get every thought out.
* **Dream Journaling:** Write down your dreams as soon as you wake up.

Journaling is a gift you give to yourself—a space for reflection, growth, and self-discovery. By making it a regular part of your routine, you can build a more intentional and mindful life.",1,1756747268.0,u_zakariiaibra,0,1.0,False

There is a chance that a job offer in Oslo with appx. 1 million nok salary.

It’s a small town with 30 000 people, I bought a new apartment, and salary is around 1 million, good job. 
I am 34, single male. 
Traveling abroad and even in Norway is not very convenient from my location. Most of time have to pay high ticket fees and wait for long hours between transfers. Social life sucks, only Friday drinking activities. No concert, no live music, no proper performances…
I play tennis now and then. Kept me busy. But struggle after work mostly after 15:30. Heading to the gym 3 times a week. Helping but I feel like I lack energy and good social community. Missing getting lost in city crowds. 
Weather this year wasn’t helping either. Sunny days were either foggy or strong wind. 
The grass is looking greener on this side for me for Oslo around ring 2-3. I know I might have to rent a place, and start living on a budget as expenses can go quickly up. But really missing grabbing a coffee even on Sundays, walking in the city without walking against a strong wind and rain. Discovering neighborhoods and trying new places…

When I was a teenager, I discovered Craigslist, and everything just kind of snowballed from there. You wouldn't believe the kinds of things you can find on the internet - the kind of jobs you can secure without having to do any paperwork. Most of the time the people hiring either don't want to be traceable by the government, or they're just far too desperate at that point to add any additional hoops to jump through. 

That was how I met Chelsea. It was actually a really funny story, perfect for telling at parties. It would be perfect for our wedding, too, and for telling our kids. It would have been, at least. 

We met because we had both been hired to come to this birthday party, a kid turning eleven. Neither of us fully knew what the job entailed when we agreed, which might have been a sign that we shouldn't have, but we were both informed we'd be paid handsomely, and that was all that either of us needed to hear. 

When we got there Frank, a middle aged guy with a salt-and-pepper beard who smelled strongly of patchouli and marinara sauce, informed us we were to get in a huge screaming match around the middle of the party. We were playing a couple from a few houses down who were really on the fritz, I guess. We weren't told why, just what to do. I'm still not sure why he wanted us to do that. 

I was hesitant. I wasn't much of an actor. But Chelsea, she threw herself into the role wholeheartedly. A couple of hours later we were sitting on the curb a block away, and she was holding a bag of frozen carrots against my swollen cheekbone, and I was nursing a blunt, wincing at how my chocolate milk soaked clothing stuck to my skin. 

We compared stories of our strangest jobs, our craziest experiences, the worst things we'd ever done to make a couple bucks. We both agreed that anything below a felony was fair game, but we gravitated towards weird yet legal and harmless tasks. She had a passion for all of it that I'd never seen in anyone I'd ever met. She was really doing it for the experiences, not the money. She was a thrill seeker. 

I fell in love with her quickly, like getting hit over the head with a blunt object. It was aggressive and immediate. 

A couple of months later we got a place together, and the rest was history. We fell into a nice, domestic routine: she made me coffee in the morning and kissed my forehead when I walked into the kitchen, we took turns cooking dinner and doing the dishes and we watched hours of reality television slop on our sofa that was just big enough for two. We talked about the future. We talked about a dog and two kids and a yard. It all just fell into place. 

Her friends liked me, and my friends liked her, and our families were the same. My mother became a little too obsessed with having a grandchild, and I had to beg her to stop asking Chelsea about her cycle. But none of them knew about our secret life, the jobs we did together when everyone went home. It was just for us, and it was exciting, this secret hobby that we shared. 

The first call from OEM came on a quiet Friday. Chelsea was at her job as a barista, and I was at home getting some cleaning done before having lunch with my parents, like an old person. 

I was used to getting calls that didn't have identification, considering all my side jobs, so I didn't bat an eye at the NO CALLER ID on my screen. What was different, however, was the automated message that played as soon as I picked up the call. 

""*This call may be recorded for quality assurance and training purposes. Please state your first and last name, and your date of birth.*"" 

I frowned, tossing the rag I'd been cleaning the stove with onto the kitchen counter. 

""Julian Raines, May 14th, 1999."" 

There was a silence, and then a beep. Then a man spoke, non-automated this time. 

""*Hello, Mr. Raines. I've been informed you might be looking for a job?*"" 

When Chelsea got home, I was waiting for her on the couch. She came up behind me, cupped my face in her hands, and kissed the top of my head. 

""Hey, babe,"" I said, trying to keep the excitement out of my voice. ""How was work?"" 

""Exhausting."" She slumped over the back of the couch, smushing the cushions. ""But I got this crazy voicemail..."" 

The facility was in what looked, from the outside, like a dilapidated warehouse. The man who picked us up in a long black car was very quiet, answering our questions in single word responses and keeping his eyes on the road. Chelsea and I kept giving each other small glances and squeezing each other's hands the entire way there. 

A man greeted us at the car door, opening it for us with a smile. He was tall and thin, and he wore a crisp suit with his dark hair slicked back, not a strand askew. 

""Mr. and Mrs. Raines, I presume?"" 

Chelsea looked down shyly. I was surprised, she was never shy - but this situation definitely felt more professional than what we were used to. 

""We aren't married..."" 

""Oh! Oh, I'm sorry."" The man tapped his forehead with the palm of his hand good-naturedly. ""I'm so sorry, miss...?""

""Sutherland."" 

""Miss Sutherland, of course."" He reached out to shake her hand, and then mine, eager. ""My name is Malcolm Kessler. You can just call me Kessler. Would you like to know what you're doing here?"" 

We let Kessler lead us into the building. On the inside, it looked far less run down... we were greeted with long white hallways and bustling professionals holding coffees and clipboards, wearing matching white lab coats. 

""Is this like... a hospital?"" Chelsea asked, gazing around in awe. I took her hand again, and she gave it a squeeze. 

""No, not a hospital... although there are medical professionals here, and we do certainly have access to those kinds of tools."" He offered us a sly grin. 

We entered a room with a metal table and four chairs, and not much else. A woman with her hair tied up in a tight bun came in, placed a stack of papers on the table, and scurried away. Kessler gestured for us to take a seat. 

""This,"" he said slowly, looking from me, to Chelsea, and back again. ""This is OEM. Do you know what that stands for?"" He waited for us to shake our heads before continuing. ""This is the Office of Enhanced Methods."" 

I blinked at him, the white fluorescent lights making my eyes burn. ""What does that mean?"" 

""I'm glad you ask."" Kessler leaned back in his seat, folding his hands in his lap. ""Essentially, here at OEM, we test torture methods. See what works, see what doesn't, see what we need to change or scale back on. You know."" 

I could feel Chelsea looking at me. I looked back. I couldn't quite read her expression, but somehow I still could get the gist. 

""Is this... um... a government project?"" She asked, her eyes still locked on mine and her brows furrowing. 

Kessler chuckled. ""You could say that.""

""So why do you need us?"" I asked, even though I felt I might know the answer, finally looking away from my girlfriend and back at the man in front of us. 

Kessler sighed, leaning forward again, resting his elbows on the table. He had quite a sharp face, but it managed to feel charming and welcoming purely from his expression. I wondered if he'd practiced that. ""I'll level with you,"" he said, quieter than before. ""We need volunteers. But finding volunteers for something like this is... difficult. That's why now we're looking for people like you, people who are interested in doing odd jobs like this one, and we're offering a large amount of compensation."" 

I pressed my lips together, searching his face for any sign of deception or exaggeration. I found none. I glanced back at Chelsea, who was looking at the stack of paperwork. 

""How much compensation?"" I asked finally, when it became clear that no one else was going to say it. I expected Kessler to laugh. He didn't. 

""Are you two looking to get married?"" 

I felt the room heat up. Truthfully, I had bought the ring a month ago. I was just waiting for the right time, and a time when we could properly plan for a wedding without the stress of becoming bankrupt for it. 

""Yes, I mean, eventually..."" 

""Have you seen how much those venues cost these days?"" Kessler raised his eyebrows sympathetically, leaning even closer to us. ""Not to mention a honeymoon... are you looking to have kids, start a family? Send those kids to college? Grow old and retire?"" 

The man actually reached out, actually took my hand in one of his and Chelsea's in his other. I felt like the air in the room was being sucked out of it. 

""I'm going to be honest with you two, I am not going to mince words. It's tough out there right now. I could make it so you never have to worry about money again."" 

He left us in the room to let us talk alone, and I could have sworn I heard the lock click behind him, but to be fair I was feeling pretty jumpy by that point. Chelsea and I sat for a moment in silence. 

""This is a lot,"" she muttered, running her fingers through her hair. ""This place is crazy."" 

I reached over to flip through the paperwork, chewing on my bottom lip. I saw words like non-disclosure agreement, liability, medical care... I put the paperwork back down and took her hand again. 

""It's a lot of money. He seemed serious.""

""Would we be considered... like... war criminals? If we took part in this?"" She laughed, but I could tell she was anxious. 

I shrugged slowly. She rubbed at her face with her free hand, a nervous habit of hers. I reached over and tucked some hair behind her ear, smiling. She smiled back apprehensively. 

There was something neither of us were saying, something neither of us wanted to point out. *How bad was the job to offer that amount of compensation?* 

Still, there was a buzz between us. This was what we did, we signed up for strange things for the experiences... Chelsea lived for things like this. I think I knew the second we got there that she would end up wanting to do it. 

When Kessler came back, I stood up, pushing my chair back and wiping my sweaty hands on my jeans. 

""What kind of torture are we talking about?"" 

His smile was wide. ""I can show you now, if you'd like."" 

He explained as he lead us back down the hall, guiding us into a different room that was essentially the exact same as the one we had just been in, but with more cameras mounted on the walls and with different chairs... I winced a little when I saw the wrist and ankle restraints attached to the sterile metal frame.

""Everything we do here stays within these walls,"" he told us, gesturing for us to take a seat. Chelsea and I shared a look, then obeyed. ""Communication wise, but also physically. We will do nothing to permanently damage you, and we have medical staff on sight for any treatment you may need."" 

As if on cue, a man in one of the lab coats bustled into the room, pushing a cart. He began strapping down our wrists, leaving our legs unrestrained. 

""Everything is voluntary,"" Kessler continued. ""Nothing will happen to you without your explicit consent, although we may need to withhold some details in order to get the most accurate read on your reactions. You can leave or discontinue your contracts at any time."" 

The man in the lab coat started putting on medical gloves. I swallowed hard. 

""What is he going to do?"" 

Kessler nodded at the man, who procured a syringe from his cart, examining the needle carefully and then picking up a little glass bottle to draw from. 

""This is just... let's call it a sample. This is something we've been working on for a while, it's already been tested many times with a high success rate."" 

I wondered what a high success rate in this context was. A large sum of pain? The right amount of screaming? 

""Usually, we'd probably hook you up to various brain wave sensors, but we'll start light today."" 

The doctor (was he a doctor?) approached Chelsea, who squirmed anxiously. He wiped her arm with an alcohol swab, and began feeling around for a good vein. I watched her, trying to look encouraging when her eyes met mine. 

""This is a sort of... *liquid electrocution*. Per say."" 

Before either of us could reply to that, the doctor was inserting the needle into Chelsea's arm and pushing down on the plunger. 

I watched her body seize up, her eyes going wide and glassy. She was perfectly still for a moment, save for her mouth falling open and her entire face going slack... and then she began to twitch and spasm, her limbs jerking with no control. Then she screamed, a gurgling, horrifying sound, and I was struck with panic. 

I was so distracted I barely felt the needle sliding into my own arm. 

And then it felt like I was being set on fire. 

We didn't go back to that place for a couple of months. Kessler told us to take our time, to think about it, as he handed us a tall stack of dollar bills. The feeling of the money almost bulging out of my pocket almost made up for the pain. 

He had told the truth: it didn't last. It felt like the effects of the injection lasted an hour, but we were told it had only been a few minutes before it wore off. I expected to be weak leaving the facility, and prepared myself to be embarrassed to handle it worse than my girlfriend did, but the feeling faded fast. In fact, I almost felt more alive. 

We were given a brief interview where a younger man scribbled extensive notes, and then we were free to go. 

The first thing Chelsea said to me when we got outside was, ""What a rush!"" 

Still, we waited a while. It felt like a next step in our odd jobs hobby to make this a regular thing, like something a little bit depraved. It was dystopian, it was strange and scary. Even though the sensation was gone, I could vividly remember what the injection had done to me, how it had torn through my veins, how I had wondered if I was dying... and that was supposed to just be a *sample*. 

But eventually, neither of us could stay away. The money was good... beyond good. 

At first, we kept it a secret from each other, as if we were doing something bad. She would head off to work, and I would drive to the warehouse. They would inject me, feed me things that made me sick, toss me around, even beat me, and then I would drive home, still reeling and sore. Chelsea started acting strange, staying up after I went to bed, but I couldn't exactly call her out on it, because I was being strange too. 

Neither of us wanted to put any pressure on the other, I guess. And I don't think either of us liked the idea of the other getting tortured. 

It was all but confirmed in my mind that we were both doing the same thing when I caught her coming through the front door at almost three AM, rubbing at her temple like she had a horrible migraine. I was sitting on the couch, reading a book, waiting for her. 

She stopped cold, her eyes going wide. I couldn't help but chuckle. 

""Cheating on me?"" I asked. She laughed, plopping down next to me on the couch. 

""Not exactly."" 

I pulled her to me, and she rested her head on my shoulder. 

""Let's just do it together, okay? From now on, let's just go together."" 

I waited for an answer, but after a minute, all I got was a snore. 

We went together the next weekend. Kessler greeted us, patting each of us on our backs cheerfully. 

""Great to see you two together again! The work you both have been doing here is just fantastic."" 

Chelsea and I eyed each other, and she gave me a little punch on the arm. I grinned at her. 

""I have something different for you two today, now that you're here together, if you're up for it."" 

My smile faded a little, twisting into mild concern. I licked my lips. ""Different how?"" 

He waved me off, guiding us into one of the rooms. The same chairs greeted us, with their cuffs and restraints. A doctor was already inside, toying with some kind of strap. It looked sort of like a headband. 

""We'd like to try something more... psychological... than you're used to."" 

I stopped in my tracks. Kessler and Chelsea both turned to face me, their eyebrows raising in sync. 

""Psychological torture?"" I was getting vivid images in my head, all of the psychological horror movies I'd ever seen rushing back to me. Physical pain was one thing, but sanity was delicate, something that shouldn't be played with. 

Kessler approached me, placing his hands on each of my shoulders, and offered me a reassuring smile. 

""Think about it, Mr. Raines,"" he said, his voice kind. ""It will be a brief test, it'll only last around thirty seconds. Like I've said, nothing will leave this facility, and we have professionals to assess your mental state directly afterwards. Thirty seconds for enough money to buy a used car."" 

I worried my lips together, the fear I'd had in the past creeping back in... if it wasn't dangerous, why was it worth so much? Worth more than we'd been paid for anything before? 

""Come on, Jules."" Chelsea smiled at me from behind him. She didn't look afraid, and it soothed me a little. ""We'll do it together."" 

I nodded reluctantly. Almost as soon as my chin raised to do so, the doctor was slipping the headband on, two metal plates digging into my forehead. I felt my muscles tense up. 

We took our seats, and Chelsea reached over to grab my hand. They didn't strap us down this time, which I hardly thought about until after it was too late. 

The doctor put Chelsea's headband on too, and she made a face at me, which made me bite back a laugh. 

""Ready?"" Kessler asked. Then he nodded at the doctor, who pressed something on what looked like a keyboard, and Julie started to scream. 

The second he touched the thing, she was screaming. 

It wasn't like any scream I had ever heard before, not like the one from the first time we'd been here and not in any horror movie. Certainly never in real life. It felt like my eardrums were bursting, and it only grew louder and more shrill. 

It was desperate. It was beyond torture, beyond pain, beyond anything a human could possibly endure. I imagined hell, I imagined that souls being dragged to damnation, might sound something like that scream. I wasn't even religious. 

She squeezed my hand and I felt my bones cracking. 

""Chelsea! Chelsea?"" 

I rocketed out of my seat, trying to shake her, trying to ignore the searing pain. She wouldn't let go of my hand, couldn't. Her eyes were wide open and dead, looking right at me but not seeing anything. Still, tears streamed from them, more tears than I'd ever seen anyone cry. 

I whipped back around. The doctor was typing urgently at his computer, and Kessler was staring, his hands out and his eyes moving rapidly back and forth like he was in shock. 

""Jesus Christ, do something!"" I screamed. ""Fucking do something!"" 

Chelsea was gasping now, a ragged sound that bounced around in my head. It felt like I could hear nothing but that horrible wet gasp, just dead air and her throat clawing for breath, drool seeping from her mouth and down her chin. 

Finally, I ripped the headband off her. Instantly she went slack, letting go of my hand. 

The room was silent for a moment. Then Kessler muttered something to the other man, and the doctor rushed out the door. 

""Chelsea? Chelsea, baby are you okay?"" I kneeled in front of her, rubbing her knee. She wouldn't look at me, wouldn't move. For a second, I wondered if she was dead. ""Please answer me..."" 

Right when I was about to check her pulse, her head turned. She wasn't screaming anymore, but her eyes were just as dead as they had been before when they met mine. They didn't even look like her eyes anymore. 

She opened her mouth, and out of it came a horrible whispery sound, like she'd forgotten how to use her tongue. I leaned in closer, trying to smile at her weakly. 

""What is it, honey?"" 

""Please,"" she gasped. ""No more."" 

I felt hot, I felt like I had a horrible fever. I reached up, touched her wet face. ""It's over, baby. No more. It's over."" 

She stared at me, if you could call it that. She wasn't in her body anymore. This was something else. She twitched. 

""Just kill me..."" 

I turned back to look at Kessler. He looked just as shocked as I did, anxiously adjusting his tie. For a long moment we met eyes, and I knew what he was thinking. Something had gone horribly, unbelievably wrong here. 

And he didn't know how to fix it. 

The next few hours were a horrible blur. I remember doctors rushing around, wheeling Chelsea out of the room despite my pleas to know where they were going, to let me go with them. I sat alone in the cold, sterile room, her scream echoing around in my head. I cried, I begged the cameras in the corners of the room, I banged my head against the table. Someone came in and bandaged up my broken hand, but no one would tell me anything. 

It felt like days that I was in there. Honestly, it could have been. When the door finally opened again and Kessler stepped through it, I couldn't even feel relieved... I just felt broken. 

""Where is she?"" I croaked, raising my head. ""Is she okay?"" 

He said nothing, just sat down in front of me. He was back to business, the horrified expression I'd last seen him have completely wiped away, although I could have sworn his face was a little pale. 

He took an envelope out of his pocket and placed it on the metal table between us. 

""Miss Sutherland is right outside. She's unharmed, and feeling fine."" 

I choked out a sob: I couldn't help it. I hid my face in my hands. Kessler cleared his throat and continued. 

""You are to take this envelope. Inside is a check for seven hundred thousand dollars. One of our drivers is going to take you to the emergency room, where you will have your hand properly treated. Any further medical bills will be completely covered by us. You are to do this, and then go home and never return here. Do you understand?"" 

I looked up at him, and I nodded. I was angry: I wanted to yell, demand answers, threaten to sue... but I was far too exhausted for any of that. I just wanted to see Chelsea, I just wanted to go home. Kessler nodded, his mouth pressed into a thin line. 

""We at OEM are terribly ashamed about what took place today. Please accept our deepest condolences.""

Something about that rubbed me the wrong way, made my skin prickle, but my mind was numb. I just nodded again, taking the envelope and shoving it into my pocket. 

Chelsea was just outside like he'd said, and she smiled when she saw me. I gathered her in my arms and squeezed, breathing in the scent of her hair, kissing the side of her neck. 

""Thank god you're okay."" 

""Hey, hey, don't cry..."" She pulled back, kissing my cheek and wiping away my tears. ""I'm more than okay, baby. What a rush!"" 

A laugh burst out of me like an uncontrollable cough.

""You're a psychopath.""

""You like it."" 

As promised, we were taken to the hospital, where I was put in a cast. My hand was broken in three different places. As Chelsea sat with me while they examined it, a horrible, anxious feeling crept over me. When I looked at her, all she did was smile. 

I couldn't sleep that night. I stared at the ceiling, white spots drifting across my vision, my hand throbbing dully on my chest. Chelsea's back pressed against the side of my arm was the only thing that made me feel any calmer. I turned to look at the back of her head, chewing on my lip. 

The room felt too quiet, too dark after spending so long in that bright sterile room. I was restless. 

""Chelsea?"" I whispered. ""Are you awake?"" 

She said nothing. She wasn't snoring, but I swore I could hear her heart beating. *Ka-thunk. Ka-thunk. Ka-thunk*. 

I sighed. ""What did you feel? When it was happening?"" 

I knew she wouldn't respond, but I asked anyways. I needed to talk, even if it was just to myself. 

*Ka-thunk. Ka-thunk*. 

I felt her shift a little, her back moving with each of her breaths. Her heartbeat began to speed up. Only then did I begin to wonder why I could hear it at all, and so loud. 

I sat up a little, leaning on my elbows. I stroked her hair. 

""Hey, baby... are you okay?"" 

No answer. *Ka-thunk ka-thunk ka-thunk...*

Suddenly I had that feeling. I had that feeling children get at night, when they become positive there's someone in the closet or just outside their bedroom door, someone they don't know. Panic raced through me, and whether it was rational or not, I had to see her face. I had to be sure she was alive, and she was herself, and she was real. 

I reached over and took her arm, rolling her towards me. 

Chelsea's eyes were wide open, bloodshot, and my heart jumped into my throat when I realized it hadn't been her heartbeat that I had been hearing. It had been her gasping for air, her throat closing and opening again rapidly, swallowing and heaving dryly in the dark like an animal about to throw up. *Ka-thunk-ka-thunk-ka-thunk*... 

I shook her awake, sitting straight up in the bed. She gasped, blinking at me almost sleepily, rubbing at her eyes. 

""Julian...?"" Her voice was raspy, tired and dry, but otherwise normal. I flicked on the bedside lamp, breathing hard. ""Babe, what's wrong?"" 

I shook my head. I couldn't look at her, couldn't breathe. I felt her wrap her arms around me, shushing me gently and stroking my hair. 

""You... you were..."" 

""Shh, it's okay. It's okay now, Jules, I'm okay. Just a bad dream..."" 

But it wasn't a dream. I knew it wasn't. 

After that my girlfriend was different. She wasn't herself. 

I tried to go back to normal... she certainly tried to. She went to work like before, saw her friends, watched television with me on our couch. But it didn't feel like she was really there anymore. She didn't sleep much at all, and when she did, it was strange and restless. I more than once caught her sleeping with her eyes wide open, just like that first night. 

Once I asked her what her dreams had been like recently and she hesitated, before telling me: 

""You know how when meat is fresh, and the muscles are still alive, so they move and squirm even though the animal is dead?"" She smiled and ruffled my hair. ""That's what the backs of my eyelids look like."" 

The worst part was how normal she pretended to be. How fine she told me she felt, how she kissed me like always and how she tried to joke, but it never came out quite right. 

I reached my limit one night a month later when I got home after having a drink with some friends. 

The house was completely dark, completely silent, completely still. The second I opened the door, I felt it. The unexplainable terror. Like there was a man in the closet. 

It didn't feel right in there. Nothing felt like it was in the right place, even though I knew it must have been. Everything just felt wrong. 

""Chelsea?"" I called out quietly, shrugging off my jacket, wet from the rain. ""Are you awake, honey?"" 

No answer. I went to go upstairs when I saw her. 

She was down our hallway. Her head was half poking out around the corner, only her eyes showing in the darkness, wide open. Staring at me, but not seeing me. 

She started to scream, and it was even worse to not be able to see her mouth. She screamed in short bursts, like a panting dog, the bloodcurdling sounds jolting out of her. 

Fight or flight kicked in. I turned around and walked right back out the door, closing it behind me. I walked until I was across the street before looking back at the house. 

She was in our bedroom window, the lights turned on, illuminating her silhouette. I watched her rear back and slam her head into the glass once, then again, then again, something dark and liquid trickling down to the frame. 

The paramedics had to tie her down to keep her from thrashing, or from hurting herself. 

I watched as they took her away, begging them to kill her. 

I tried to call OEM, but all I got was a message that the number had been disconnected. I drove back there while she was still in the hospital, but there was nothing left but an empty warehouse. 

When I picked her up, she was completely normal again, the only proof of the episode being the stitches on her forehead. 

It was that day, the day I picked her up, when I felt completely broken down and helpless, that I started to hear her voice. 

""*Honey...?*"" 

I looked over at my girlfriend, or what my girlfriend had become. She was staring out the window, smiling peacefully. 

""What was that?""

She glanced at me, her smile widening. ""Nothing, Julian. I didn't say anything."" 

I turned back to the road, convinced I was just losing my mind. I had to be. It would make sense. 

But then I heard it again. 

""*Julian, open your eyes, honey, it's okay... Jesus Christ, Kessler, would you take that thing off him? I think he's had enough!*"" 

It’s been weeks since then now. We’re home, we’re safe, or at least that’s what Chelsea says. I’m trying to believe her. 

I know it was in my head. I know it was just whatever that device did to me. 

But it felt so real when it was happening. 

I’m terrified one day I’ll wake up again in that room, and I don’t think if I did I would bounce back so quickly. ",9,1756747187.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False
1n5upbr,https://i.redd.it/i4d8two07lmf1.jpeg,"Just upgraded from my 2020 Frame to the 2025 Pro — love the new tech, but kinda miss some old stuff","Thought I’d share the upgrade experience because it’s been a mix of wow and a little nostalgia so hope this helps those of you thinking on upgrading.

Here is my take. So after 5 years with my 2020 Frame, I finally got the 2025 Pro (65 now up to 75”).

First impressions: The new panel is great (may I remind you the 2020 screen was glossy not matte). The Neo QLED with Mini-LED just blows the 2020 out of the water. Art looks way more realistic — colors pop, blacks are deeper, showing art” and more like… well, art. But because of this you really need crisp high quality images for your art. (Though it might be the bigger tv size playing a role here)

The wireless box: This was the big change for me. I actually tucked the One Connect Box inside my coffee table, and it works perfectly. Bonus: my soundbar lives underneath, and with Q-Symphony running, the sound is fuller than I expected.

What I miss from the 2020:
	•	That super thin almost invisible cable. It was just one elegant strand and made everything feel so clean. Still neat, but not quite the same minimal magic. Yes you can still get the cable version but for me it was not worth because a) slower processor and b) I wanted to move the one connect box to the coffee table. 

	•	The old Tizen UI. It was dead simple and fast. The new One UI Tizen looks slick and has all these AI tricks, but I’ve already had a freeze or two where I had to reboot. The 2020 menus just felt… easier.

	•	On the not that noticeable part is the quality of the bezel. Both old and new are modern white, but the 2025 does look/feels/is plastic. The 2020 was metallic and felt different.

In summary, I don’t regret upgrading at all, the picture quality alone is worth it, plus my own objectives like the better sound. But I get why some folks might still love their older Frames. The 2020 had a kind of understated elegance, while the 2025 Pro feels more like a cutting-edge hub (Gen AI, Pantone match, Processor, space, etc) that happens to look like a picture frame. Different vibes, both still cool.

Anyone else made the 5 or older jump? Or interested to jump? (Ama) Curious if you’re loving the wireless setup or if you miss that one thin cable too.",11,1756747086.0,TheFrame,2,1.0,False

John burned their passes in a coffee can on the shoulder of the last paved road. The flame started small, undercut by a damp breeze. He cupped a hand to feed it, then dropped the next plastic in and watched it curl.

Lofa held his own. The card felt warm from his palm, slick from sweat. If he kept it, he carried a line out of the woods. If he let it go, there was only his father’s plan. He wanted to keep the line. He wanted his father not to see that.

“We’re doing this,” John said. “All of us.”

Daryl shoved past him and flicked his in hard. “All of us.”

Freya stood with her arms folded. She didn’t move. Diana closed her coat and tucked stray hair behind her ear, her mouth pressed flat. She stepped forward, placed her pass in gently, and stepped back. No words.

Traffic stuttered behind them: two trucks with metal cages in the bed, a sedan with a shattered rear window taped over, a van with tires worn to braids. From the ditch came the smell of mud and old oil. Somewhere a dog barked on and on, a repetitive echo from the gas station up the road.

John’s shoulders eased a notch when Diana let go of hers. His gaze flicked to Lofa’s hands.

Lofa hated being watched. He wanted space to think, to weigh each thread he was about to cut. “Why can’t we just hide it?” The words slid out softer than he meant. Too soft for Daryl to miss.

“You want to go back one day?” Daryl said. “Go back to what?”

“To school,” Lofa said, too quick. The answer made Daryl’s lip lift.

“School,” Daryl said. “Right.”

“Enough.” John’s voice wasn’t loud. It didn’t have to be. “We’re not carrying hooks to the old world.”

Lofa looked down at the plastic, the faded photo of his own face. He knew what Daryl would do if he slipped it into his pocket. He knew the way the next months could tilt, the way meals would degrade and the air would grow sharp with a fight pressed down by walls with no insulation.

#The Proposal
Enter: Hikari Ishimori - She wants to go back in time to visit her ex-boyfriend who recently passed away. He proposed to her in Funiculi Funicula

Hikari is in the cafe telling a story to Kazu, Fumiko and Nagare about how her ex Yoji proposed to her last year. Hikari and Yoji were part of a group of 6 friends who regularly attended escape rooms together. Eventually 4 of the group members paired up as couples leaving Yoji and Hikari as the singletons. The group often egged them on to get together. This eventually happened, leaving to Yoji’s proposal at the cafe. Back then, she didn’t like the cafe’s aesthetic and thought to herself she’d never come back. Nagare and Kazu are non-chalant in their listening but Fumiko is very much engaged and inquisitive. This sparks conversation about travelling back in time and Hikari is astounded at Fumiko’s upfront eagerness to hear about her love life as a stranger. Hikari only learned about time travel after Yoji sent her a random email with nothing but this fact. Fumiko is asked about her boyfriend in America and is all of a sudden timid. They don’t speak much. Hikari muses at the fact that Fumiko annoys her, not because Fumiko is a know it all but because Hikari can tell she’s the type of person that’s very stubborn. 

Back to Hikari - Yoji told her he would wait for her after she rejected his proposal but then 6 months later told her he’d found someone else. He died shortly after this and she was left in anger, wondering how he could just move on from her like that. She starts to spiral in thought about his reasons and goes to and fro about travelling back in time to see him. She wants answers and wants to let him know how she feels. The cafe rules make it harder for her as she learns she can’t change anything so struggles to see the benefit. Kazu doing her silent saviour act inspires Hikari to take the plunge. Hikari she decides she wants no regrets, which seemingly inspires Fumiko to leave the cafe and contact her boyfriend in America. 

After being explained all the rules in their entirety, Hikari is apprehensive about the coffee getting too cold. This apprehension is eased by Kazu appearing with the tool that informs the drinker about the coffee’s temperature. Hikari is slightly annoyed that she wasn’t told about it right away, but also relieved that it exists. The ceremony is prepared, the coffee is poured, and Hikari experiences a kaleidoscopic experience - becoming one with the steam and rising to the ceiling as she travels back in time. 

Before she’s in the past we see a glimpse of young Hikari who cut her hair short after a TV show inspired her to do so, claiming that it would improve her love life. The person she did it for, one of the escape group members, simply responded with “oh” and it left her feeling low. Yoji, however, liked her new hair and this compliment stuck with her. A year later once her hair had grown back, Yoji randomly came out with a comment complimenting how he also likes her with long hair. He waited exactly a year to do so as he’s the type to pay attention the small details such as this.

When she lands in the past Hikari almost stands up but Yoji shouts to stop her. He knows she’s travelled from the future but she doesn’t understand how. He goes on to explain that when he told her “he would wait for her” he meant that he would be sitting in the Cafe waiting for her. He knew he was dying and set up an elaborate plan to protect her by not telling her he was dying when he proposed so she didn’t feel guilted into accepting. He also came up with a few options to break up with her but opted for the new woman angle. What ensues is a back an forth with Hikari annoyed at Yoji for leaving her in the dark, and Yoji amused at Hikari’s reaction - as he planned everything down to the last detail and it’s all come into fruition. While Hikari is berating him, Yoji manages to squeeze in a proposal, placing the ring on Hikari’s finger. The couple are happily married, for the time it takes Hikari’s coffee to go cold.


#The Farewell
Enter: Michiko Kijimoto - the begrudged daughter of Kengo Kijiomoto. She wants to travel back in time and right the wrongs between her and her father.

Michiko tells a story to Nagare and Nana Kohtake of meeting her father at Funiculi Funicula 6 years ago. He was visiting her at university because she’d been airing his calls. The meeting doesn’t go all too well as Michiko is so angry at her father for being overbearing and trying to win her over with gifts, which she throws back in his face. Unfortunately, Kengo dies not long after his visit, back home in a devastating earthquake. Michiko blames herself for treating him so badly during the visit and wishes to go back to save him. 

Michiko learned of the cafe’s time travel offering through her husband Yusuke, who was waiting for her outside. He comes in to find an upset Michiko who tells him the wedding is off. Nana Kohtake informs him that she didn’t travel back in time because time travel doesn’t allow the present to be altered. Yusuke then tells Nana that the reason she wouldn’t marry him is because her father had evacuated his home upon hearing about the earthquake but returned to grab his Bankbook - savings for his daughter’s wedding.  

Later on we see Nana Kohtake return to the cafe, after being called by Kazu. Nana asks a customer, Fusagi, if he had the chance to sit in *that* seat, but he mentions not being able to do so before leaving the cafe. Nana thanks Kazu for the call and follows Fusagi out. Nana comes across Michiko upon leaving, who was idling in the entrance to the cafe. She returns to take the cafe up on its special offering. When she lands in the past she’s met by her father who speaks to her in an apprehensive and apologetic manner. Michiko notices this and reflects on how she feels like such a bad daughter having seen the way Kengo instinctively speaks to her. She tells her father she’s pregnant and getting married and he gives her the Bankbook he was saving for her wedding. Before the coffee gets cold, the stirrer dings and Kengo uses the distraction as an opportunity to hit the loo. Michiko, having realised that all her father wanted was to see her happy, tells Kengo that’s she’s glad she’s his daughter and gives him a smile through her tears before finishing the coffee. She returns to the present, where Kazu asks her how it went. She decides she wants to be happy with Yusuke and exits the cafe with him.

Kazu gets a call from Professor Kadokura to say his wife has woken up!

I hope you all enjoyed book 4. See you in the future for book 5!

1n5unxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1n5unxd/my_girlfriend_and_i_get_tortured_for_a_living/,My girlfriend and I get tortured for a living. Something went seriously wrong during her last session and now she's different,"I've always had a bit of a passion for odd jobs. 

When I was a teenager, I discovered Craigslist, and everything just kind of snowballed from there. You wouldn't believe the kinds of things you can find on the internet - the kind of jobs you can secure without having to do any paperwork. Most of the time the people hiring either don't want to be traceable by the government, or they're just far too desperate at that point to add any additional hoops to jump through. 

That was how I met Chelsea. It was actually a really funny story, perfect for telling at parties. It would be perfect for our wedding, too, and for telling our kids. It would have been, at least. 

We met because we had both been hired to come to this birthday party, a kid turning eleven. Neither of us fully knew what the job entailed when we agreed, which might have been a sign that we shouldn't have, but we were both informed we'd be paid handsomely, and that was all that either of us needed to hear. 

When we got there Frank, a middle aged guy with a salt-and-pepper beard who smelled strongly of patchouli and marinara sauce, informed us we were to get in a huge screaming match around the middle of the party. We were playing a couple from a few houses down who were really on the fritz, I guess. We weren't told why, just what to do. I'm still not sure why he wanted us to do that. 

I was hesitant. I wasn't much of an actor. But Chelsea, she threw herself into the role wholeheartedly. A couple of hours later we were sitting on the curb a block away, and she was holding a bag of frozen carrots against my swollen cheekbone, and I was nursing a blunt, wincing at how my chocolate milk soaked clothing stuck to my skin. 

We compared stories of our strangest jobs, our craziest experiences, the worst things we'd ever done to make a couple bucks. We both agreed that anything below a felony was fair game, but we gravitated towards weird yet legal and harmless tasks. She had a passion for all of it that I'd never seen in anyone I'd ever met. She was really doing it for the experiences, not the money. She was a thrill seeker. 

I fell in love with her quickly, like getting hit over the head with a blunt object. It was aggressive and immediate. 

A couple of months later we got a place together, and the rest was history. We fell into a nice, domestic routine: she made me coffee in the morning and kissed my forehead when I walked into the kitchen, we took turns cooking dinner and doing the dishes and we watched hours of reality television slop on our sofa that was just big enough for two. We talked about the future. We talked about a dog and two kids and a yard. It all just fell into place. 

Her friends liked me, and my friends liked her, and our families were the same. My mother became a little too obsessed with having a grandchild, and I had to beg her to stop asking Chelsea about her cycle. But none of them knew about our secret life, the jobs we did together when everyone went home. It was just for us, and it was exciting, this secret hobby that we shared. 

The first call from OEM came on a quiet Friday. Chelsea was at her job as a barista, and I was at home getting some cleaning done before having lunch with my parents, like an old person. 

I was used to getting calls that didn't have identification, considering all my side jobs, so I didn't bat an eye at the NO CALLER ID on my screen. What was different, however, was the automated message that played as soon as I picked up the call. 

""*This call may be recorded for quality assurance and training purposes. Please state your first and last name, and your date of birth.*"" 

I frowned, tossing the rag I'd been cleaning the stove with onto the kitchen counter. 

""Julian Raines, May 14th, 1999."" 

There was a silence, and then a beep. Then a man spoke, non-automated this time. 

""*Hello, Mr. Raines. I've been informed you might be looking for a job?*"" 

When Chelsea got home, I was waiting for her on the couch. She came up behind me, cupped my face in her hands, and kissed the top of my head. 

""Hey, babe,"" I said, trying to keep the excitement out of my voice. ""How was work?"" 

""Exhausting."" She slumped over the back of the couch, smushing the cushions. ""But I got this crazy voicemail..."" 

The facility was in what looked, from the outside, like a dilapidated warehouse. The man who picked us up in a long black car was very quiet, answering our questions in single word responses and keeping his eyes on the road. Chelsea and I kept giving each other small glances and squeezing each other's hands the entire way there. 

A man greeted us at the car door, opening it for us with a smile. He was tall and thin, and he wore a crisp suit with his dark hair slicked back, not a strand askew. 

""Mr. and Mrs. Raines, I presume?"" 

Chelsea looked down shyly. I was surprised, she was never shy - but this situation definitely felt more professional than what we were used to. 

""We aren't married..."" 

""Oh! Oh, I'm sorry."" The man tapped his forehead with the palm of his hand good-naturedly. ""I'm so sorry, miss...?""

""Sutherland."" 

""Miss Sutherland, of course."" He reached out to shake her hand, and then mine, eager. ""My name is Malcolm Kessler. You can just call me Kessler. Would you like to know what you're doing here?"" 

We let Kessler lead us into the building. On the inside, it looked far less run down... we were greeted with long white hallways and bustling professionals holding coffees and clipboards, wearing matching white lab coats. 

""Is this like... a hospital?"" Chelsea asked, gazing around in awe. I took her hand again, and she gave it a squeeze. 

""No, not a hospital... although there are medical professionals here, and we do certainly have access to those kinds of tools."" He offered us a sly grin. 

We entered a room with a metal table and four chairs, and not much else. A woman with her hair tied up in a tight bun came in, placed a stack of papers on the table, and scurried away. Kessler gestured for us to take a seat. 

""This,"" he said slowly, looking from me, to Chelsea, and back again. ""This is OEM. Do you know what that stands for?"" He waited for us to shake our heads before continuing. ""This is the Office of Enhanced Methods."" 

I blinked at him, the white fluorescent lights making my eyes burn. ""What does that mean?"" 

""I'm glad you ask."" Kessler leaned back in his seat, folding his hands in his lap. ""Essentially, here at OEM, we test torture methods. See what works, see what doesn't, see what we need to change or scale back on. You know."" 

I could feel Chelsea looking at me. I looked back. I couldn't quite read her expression, but somehow I still could get the gist. 

""Is this... um... a government project?"" She asked, her eyes still locked on mine and her brows furrowing. 

Kessler chuckled. ""You could say that.""

""So why do you need us?"" I asked, even though I felt I might know the answer, finally looking away from my girlfriend and back at the man in front of us. 

Kessler sighed, leaning forward again, resting his elbows on the table. He had quite a sharp face, but it managed to feel charming and welcoming purely from his expression. I wondered if he'd practiced that. ""I'll level with you,"" he said, quieter than before. ""We need volunteers. But finding volunteers for something like this is... difficult. That's why now we're looking for people like you, people who are interested in doing odd jobs like this one, and we're offering a large amount of compensation."" 

I pressed my lips together, searching his face for any sign of deception or exaggeration. I found none. I glanced back at Chelsea, who was looking at the stack of paperwork. 

""How much compensation?"" I asked finally, when it became clear that no one else was going to say it. I expected Kessler to laugh. He didn't. 

""Are you two looking to get married?"" 

I felt the room heat up. Truthfully, I had bought the ring a month ago. I was just waiting for the right time, and a time when we could properly plan for a wedding without the stress of becoming bankrupt for it. 

""Yes, I mean, eventually..."" 

""Have you seen how much those venues cost these days?"" Kessler raised his eyebrows sympathetically, leaning even closer to us. ""Not to mention a honeymoon... are you looking to have kids, start a family? Send those kids to college? Grow old and retire?"" 

The man actually reached out, actually took my hand in one of his and Chelsea's in his other. I felt like the air in the room was being sucked out of it. 

""I'm going to be honest with you two, I am not going to mince words. It's tough out there right now. I could make it so you never have to worry about money again."" 

He left us in the room to let us talk alone, and I could have sworn I heard the lock click behind him, but to be fair I was feeling pretty jumpy by that point. Chelsea and I sat for a moment in silence. 

""This is a lot,"" she muttered, running her fingers through her hair. ""This place is crazy."" 

I reached over to flip through the paperwork, chewing on my bottom lip. I saw words like non-disclosure agreement, liability, medical care... I put the paperwork back down and took her hand again. 

""It's a lot of money. He seemed serious.""

""Would we be considered... like... war criminals? If we took part in this?"" She laughed, but I could tell she was anxious. 

I shrugged slowly. She rubbed at her face with her free hand, a nervous habit of hers. I reached over and tucked some hair behind her ear, smiling. She smiled back apprehensively. 

There was something neither of us were saying, something neither of us wanted to point out. *How bad was the job to offer that amount of compensation?* 

Still, there was a buzz between us. This was what we did, we signed up for strange things for the experiences... Chelsea lived for things like this. I think I knew the second we got there that she would end up wanting to do it. 

When Kessler came back, I stood up, pushing my chair back and wiping my sweaty hands on my jeans. 

""What kind of torture are we talking about?"" 

His smile was wide. ""I can show you now, if you'd like."" 

He explained as he lead us back down the hall, guiding us into a different room that was essentially the exact same as the one we had just been in, but with more cameras mounted on the walls and with different chairs... I winced a little when I saw the wrist and ankle restraints attached to the sterile metal frame.

""Everything we do here stays within these walls,"" he told us, gesturing for us to take a seat. Chelsea and I shared a look, then obeyed. ""Communication wise, but also physically. We will do nothing to permanently damage you, and we have medical staff on sight for any treatment you may need."" 

As if on cue, a man in one of the lab coats bustled into the room, pushing a cart. He began strapping down our wrists, leaving our legs unrestrained. 

""Everything is voluntary,"" Kessler continued. ""Nothing will happen to you without your explicit consent, although we may need to withhold some details in order to get the most accurate read on your reactions. You can leave or discontinue your contracts at any time."" 

The man in the lab coat started putting on medical gloves. I swallowed hard. 

""What is he going to do?"" 

Kessler nodded at the man, who procured a syringe from his cart, examining the needle carefully and then picking up a little glass bottle to draw from. 

""This is just... let's call it a sample. This is something we've been working on for a while, it's already been tested many times with a high success rate."" 

I wondered what a high success rate in this context was. A large sum of pain? The right amount of screaming? 

""Usually, we'd probably hook you up to various brain wave sensors, but we'll start light today."" 

The doctor (was he a doctor?) approached Chelsea, who squirmed anxiously. He wiped her arm with an alcohol swab, and began feeling around for a good vein. I watched her, trying to look encouraging when her eyes met mine. 

""This is a sort of... *liquid electrocution*. Per say."" 

Before either of us could reply to that, the doctor was inserting the needle into Chelsea's arm and pushing down on the plunger. 

I watched her body seize up, her eyes going wide and glassy. She was perfectly still for a moment, save for her mouth falling open and her entire face going slack... and then she began to twitch and spasm, her limbs jerking with no control. Then she screamed, a gurgling, horrifying sound, and I was struck with panic. 

I was so distracted I barely felt the needle sliding into my own arm. 

And then it felt like I was being set on fire. 

We didn't go back to that place for a couple of months. Kessler told us to take our time, to think about it, as he handed us a tall stack of dollar bills. The feeling of the money almost bulging out of my pocket almost made up for the pain. 

He had told the truth: it didn't last. It felt like the effects of the injection lasted an hour, but we were told it had only been a few minutes before it wore off. I expected to be weak leaving the facility, and prepared myself to be embarrassed to handle it worse than my girlfriend did, but the feeling faded fast. In fact, I almost felt more alive. 

We were given a brief interview where a younger man scribbled extensive notes, and then we were free to go. 

The first thing Chelsea said to me when we got outside was, ""What a rush!"" 

Still, we waited a while. It felt like a next step in our odd jobs hobby to make this a regular thing, like something a little bit depraved. It was dystopian, it was strange and scary. Even though the sensation was gone, I could vividly remember what the injection had done to me, how it had torn through my veins, how I had wondered if I was dying... and that was supposed to just be a *sample*. 

But eventually, neither of us could stay away. The money was good... beyond good. 

At first, we kept it a secret from each other, as if we were doing something bad. She would head off to work, and I would drive to the warehouse. They would inject me, feed me things that made me sick, toss me around, even beat me, and then I would drive home, still reeling and sore. Chelsea started acting strange, staying up after I went to bed, but I couldn't exactly call her out on it, because I was being strange too. 

Neither of us wanted to put any pressure on the other, I guess. And I don't think either of us liked the idea of the other getting tortured. 

It was all but confirmed in my mind that we were both doing the same thing when I caught her coming through the front door at almost three AM, rubbing at her temple like she had a horrible migraine. I was sitting on the couch, reading a book, waiting for her. 

She stopped cold, her eyes going wide. I couldn't help but chuckle. 

""Cheating on me?"" I asked. She laughed, plopping down next to me on the couch. 

""Not exactly."" 

I pulled her to me, and she rested her head on my shoulder. 

""Let's just do it together, okay? From now on, let's just go together."" 

I waited for an answer, but after a minute, all I got was a snore. 

We went together the next weekend. Kessler greeted us, patting each of us on our backs cheerfully. 

""Great to see you two together again! The work you both have been doing here is just fantastic."" 

Chelsea and I eyed each other, and she gave me a little punch on the arm. I grinned at her. 

""I have something different for you two today, now that you're here together, if you're up for it."" 

My smile faded a little, twisting into mild concern. I licked my lips. ""Different how?"" 

He waved me off, guiding us into one of the rooms. The same chairs greeted us, with their cuffs and restraints. A doctor was already inside, toying with some kind of strap. It looked sort of like a headband. 

""We'd like to try something more... psychological... than you're used to."" 

I stopped in my tracks. Kessler and Chelsea both turned to face me, their eyebrows raising in sync. 

""Psychological torture?"" I was getting vivid images in my head, all of the psychological horror movies I'd ever seen rushing back to me. Physical pain was one thing, but sanity was delicate, something that shouldn't be played with. 

Kessler approached me, placing his hands on each of my shoulders, and offered me a reassuring smile. 

""Think about it, Mr. Raines,"" he said, his voice kind. ""It will be a brief test, it'll only last around thirty seconds. Like I've said, nothing will leave this facility, and we have professionals to assess your mental state directly afterwards. Thirty seconds for enough money to buy a used car."" 

I worried my lips together, the fear I'd had in the past creeping back in... if it wasn't dangerous, why was it worth so much? Worth more than we'd been paid for anything before? 

""Come on, Jules."" Chelsea smiled at me from behind him. She didn't look afraid, and it soothed me a little. ""We'll do it together."" 

I nodded reluctantly. Almost as soon as my chin raised to do so, the doctor was slipping the headband on, two metal plates digging into my forehead. I felt my muscles tense up. 

We took our seats, and Chelsea reached over to grab my hand. They didn't strap us down this time, which I hardly thought about until after it was too late. 

The doctor put Chelsea's headband on too, and she made a face at me, which made me bite back a laugh. 

""Ready?"" Kessler asked. Then he nodded at the doctor, who pressed something on what looked like a keyboard, and Julie started to scream. 

The second he touched the thing, she was screaming. 

It wasn't like any scream I had ever heard before, not like the one from the first time we'd been here and not in any horror movie. Certainly never in real life. It felt like my eardrums were bursting, and it only grew louder and more shrill. 

It was desperate. It was beyond torture, beyond pain, beyond anything a human could possibly endure. I imagined hell, I imagined that souls being dragged to damnation, might sound something like that scream. I wasn't even religious. 

She squeezed my hand and I felt my bones cracking. 

""Chelsea! Chelsea?"" 

I rocketed out of my seat, trying to shake her, trying to ignore the searing pain. She wouldn't let go of my hand, couldn't. Her eyes were wide open and dead, looking right at me but not seeing anything. Still, tears streamed from them, more tears than I'd ever seen anyone cry. 

I whipped back around. The doctor was typing urgently at his computer, and Kessler was staring, his hands out and his eyes moving rapidly back and forth like he was in shock. 

""Jesus Christ, do something!"" I screamed. ""Fucking do something!"" 

Chelsea was gasping now, a ragged sound that bounced around in my head. It felt like I could hear nothing but that horrible wet gasp, just dead air and her throat clawing for breath, drool seeping from her mouth and down her chin. 

Finally, I ripped the headband off her. Instantly she went slack, letting go of my hand. 

The room was silent for a moment. Then Kessler muttered something to the other man, and the doctor rushed out the door. 

""Chelsea? Chelsea, baby are you okay?"" I kneeled in front of her, rubbing her knee. She wouldn't look at me, wouldn't move. For a second, I wondered if she was dead. ""Please answer me..."" 

Right when I was about to check her pulse, her head turned. She wasn't screaming anymore, but her eyes were just as dead as they had been before when they met mine. They didn't even look like her eyes anymore. 

She opened her mouth, and out of it came a horrible whispery sound, like she'd forgotten how to use her tongue. I leaned in closer, trying to smile at her weakly. 

""What is it, honey?"" 

""Please,"" she gasped. ""No more."" 

I felt hot, I felt like I had a horrible fever. I reached up, touched her wet face. ""It's over, baby. No more. It's over."" 

She stared at me, if you could call it that. She wasn't in her body anymore. This was something else. She twitched. 

""Just kill me..."" 

I turned back to look at Kessler. He looked just as shocked as I did, anxiously adjusting his tie. For a long moment we met eyes, and I knew what he was thinking. Something had gone horribly, unbelievably wrong here. 

And he didn't know how to fix it. 

The next few hours were a horrible blur. I remember doctors rushing around, wheeling Chelsea out of the room despite my pleas to know where they were going, to let me go with them. I sat alone in the cold, sterile room, her scream echoing around in my head. I cried, I begged the cameras in the corners of the room, I banged my head against the table. Someone came in and bandaged up my broken hand, but no one would tell me anything. 

It felt like days that I was in there. Honestly, it could have been. When the door finally opened again and Kessler stepped through it, I couldn't even feel relieved... I just felt broken. 

""Where is she?"" I croaked, raising my head. ""Is she okay?"" 

He said nothing, just sat down in front of me. He was back to business, the horrified expression I'd last seen him have completely wiped away, although I could have sworn his face was a little pale. 

He took an envelope out of his pocket and placed it on the metal table between us. 

""Miss Sutherland is right outside. She's unharmed, and feeling fine."" 

I choked out a sob: I couldn't help it. I hid my face in my hands. Kessler cleared his throat and continued. 

""You are to take this envelope. Inside is a check for seven hundred thousand dollars. One of our drivers is going to take you to the emergency room, where you will have your hand properly treated. Any further medical bills will be completely covered by us. You are to do this, and then go home and never return here. Do you understand?"" 

I looked up at him, and I nodded. I was angry: I wanted to yell, demand answers, threaten to sue... but I was far too exhausted for any of that. I just wanted to see Chelsea, I just wanted to go home. Kessler nodded, his mouth pressed into a thin line. 

""We at OEM are terribly ashamed about what took place today. Please accept our deepest condolences.""

Something about that rubbed me the wrong way, made my skin prickle, but my mind was numb. I just nodded again, taking the envelope and shoving it into my pocket. 

Chelsea was just outside like he'd said, and she smiled when she saw me. I gathered her in my arms and squeezed, breathing in the scent of her hair, kissing the side of her neck. 

""Thank god you're okay."" 

""Hey, hey, don't cry..."" She pulled back, kissing my cheek and wiping away my tears. ""I'm more than okay, baby. What a rush!"" 

A laugh burst out of me like an uncontrollable cough.

""You're a psychopath.""

""You like it."" 

As promised, we were taken to the hospital, where I was put in a cast. My hand was broken in three different places. As Chelsea sat with me while they examined it, a horrible, anxious feeling crept over me. When I looked at her, all she did was smile. 

I couldn't sleep that night. I stared at the ceiling, white spots drifting across my vision, my hand throbbing dully on my chest. Chelsea's back pressed against the side of my arm was the only thing that made me feel any calmer. I turned to look at the back of her head, chewing on my lip. 

The room felt too quiet, too dark after spending so long in that bright sterile room. I was restless. 

""Chelsea?"" I whispered. ""Are you awake?"" 

She said nothing. She wasn't snoring, but I swore I could hear her heart beating. *Ka-thunk. Ka-thunk. Ka-thunk*. 

I sighed. ""What did you feel? When it was happening?"" 

I knew she wouldn't respond, but I asked anyways. I needed to talk, even if it was just to myself. 

*Ka-thunk. Ka-thunk*. 

I felt her shift a little, her back moving with each of her breaths. Her heartbeat began to speed up. Only then did I begin to wonder why I could hear it at all, and so loud. 

I sat up a little, leaning on my elbows. I stroked her hair. 

""Hey, baby... are you okay?"" 

No answer. *Ka-thunk ka-thunk ka-thunk...*

Suddenly I had that feeling. I had that feeling children get at night, when they become positive there's someone in the closet or just outside their bedroom door, someone they don't know. Panic raced through me, and whether it was rational or not, I had to see her face. I had to be sure she was alive, and she was herself, and she was real. 

I reached over and took her arm, rolling her towards me. 

Chelsea's eyes were wide open, bloodshot, and my heart jumped into my throat when I realized it hadn't been her heartbeat that I had been hearing. It had been her gasping for air, her throat closing and opening again rapidly, swallowing and heaving dryly in the dark like an animal about to throw up. *Ka-thunk-ka-thunk-ka-thunk*... 

I shook her awake, sitting straight up in the bed. She gasped, blinking at me almost sleepily, rubbing at her eyes. 

""Julian...?"" Her voice was raspy, tired and dry, but otherwise normal. I flicked on the bedside lamp, breathing hard. ""Babe, what's wrong?"" 

I shook my head. I couldn't look at her, couldn't breathe. I felt her wrap her arms around me, shushing me gently and stroking my hair. 

""You... you were..."" 

""Shh, it's okay. It's okay now, Jules, I'm okay. Just a bad dream..."" 

But it wasn't a dream. I knew it wasn't. 

After that my girlfriend was different. She wasn't herself. 

I tried to go back to normal... she certainly tried to. She went to work like before, saw her friends, watched television with me on our couch. But it didn't feel like she was really there anymore. She didn't sleep much at all, and when she did, it was strange and restless. I more than once caught her sleeping with her eyes wide open, just like that first night. 

Once I asked her what her dreams had been like recently and she hesitated, before telling me: 

""You know how when meat is fresh, and the muscles are still alive, so they move and squirm even though the animal is dead?"" She smiled and ruffled my hair. ""That's what the backs of my eyelids look like."" 

The worst part was how normal she pretended to be. How fine she told me she felt, how she kissed me like always and how she tried to joke, but it never came out quite right. 

I reached my limit one night a month later when I got home after having a drink with some friends. 

The house was completely dark, completely silent, completely still. The second I opened the door, I felt it. The unexplainable terror. Like there was a man in the closet. 

It didn't feel right in there. Nothing felt like it was in the right place, even though I knew it must have been. Everything just felt wrong. 

""Chelsea?"" I called out quietly, shrugging off my jacket, wet from the rain. ""Are you awake, honey?"" 

No answer. I went to go upstairs when I saw her. 

She was down our hallway. Her head was half poking out around the corner, only her eyes showing in the darkness, wide open. Staring at me, but not seeing me. 

She started to scream, and it was even worse to not be able to see her mouth. She screamed in short bursts, like a panting dog, the bloodcurdling sounds jolting out of her. 

Fight or flight kicked in. I turned around and walked right back out the door, closing it behind me. I walked until I was across the street before looking back at the house. 

She was in our bedroom window, the lights turned on, illuminating her silhouette. I watched her rear back and slam her head into the glass once, then again, then again, something dark and liquid trickling down to the frame. 

The paramedics had to tie her down to keep her from thrashing, or from hurting herself. 

I watched as they took her away, begging them to kill her. 

I tried to call OEM, but all I got was a message that the number had been disconnected. I drove back there while she was still in the hospital, but there was nothing left but an empty warehouse. 

When I picked her up, she was completely normal again, the only proof of the episode being the stitches on her forehead. 

It was that day, the day I picked her up, when I felt completely broken down and helpless, that I started to hear her voice. 

""*Honey...?*"" 

I looked over at my girlfriend, or what my girlfriend had become. She was staring out the window, smiling peacefully. 

""What was that?""

She glanced at me, her smile widening. ""Nothing, Julian. I didn't say anything."" 

I turned back to the road, convinced I was just losing my mind. I had to be. It would make sense. 

But then I heard it again. 

""*Julian, open your eyes, honey, it's okay... Jesus Christ, Kessler, would you take that thing off him? I think he's had enough!*"" 

It’s been weeks since then now. We’re home, we’re safe, or at least that’s what Chelsea says. I’m trying to believe her. 

I know it was in my head. I know it was just whatever that device did to me. 

But it felt so real when it was happening. 

I’m terrified one day I’ll wake up again in that room, and I don’t think if I did I would bounce back so quickly. ",7,1756746996.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1n5unqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1n5unqd/remember_those_creepy_chain_emails_from_the/,Remember those creepy chain emails from the early-mid 2000's? I got one this morning.,"Maybe you’re too young or too old to know what I’m talking about. So I’ll explain first. Basically, somebody sends out an email with a subject line like: “KEEP READING. DO NOT IGNORE.” And then the message itself will contain some kind of short horror story.

Something about how a schoolgirl was pushed down a well and if you didn’t repost it or forward it to X amount of people, she’d come crawling out of your toilet and drag you down into the pipes. Something like that. They all typically follow a similar formula.

The first time I got one of them was back in middle school. Not an email, but a Facebook post that popped up on my feed. I don’t exactly remember what the story was. Just that it terrified me enough at the time that I actually did repost it. Something my friends completely roasted me for after the fact. But hey, no demon girl ever came crawling out of my toilet. So who’s to say I didn’t make the right call?

Obviously the entire concept of these chain mails or “scare mails” was pretty dumb and juvenile. And most of the stories were so terribly written that they could only ever work on skittish 13-year-olds. But as dumb as they were, they were still entertaining enough to engage with back in the day. It was fun to just fuck around and pretend they were real. Core childhood memories.

So this morning I was sitting at my desk, watching YouTube while sipping coffee. My typical routine before work. Before leaving, I did a quick scan through my emails. Nothing unusual. There was an invite to a wedding, a newsletter from my old university, my boss complaining about some bullshit.

But right before I was about to close my laptop, something new landed in my inbox. It was from an address I didn’t recognize. Just one word in the subject line.

*Sorry*

A bit weird. A bit concerning. Probably malware. I barely respond to the emails that I actually have to, why would I bother with this?

I ended up clicking on it anyway. Life had been a bit monotonous recently. Maybe this would prove to be something interesting.

The message was only a few sentences long. I’ll paste it below.

*ONE NIGHT A WOMAN WAS HIT BY A SPEEDING CAR AT NIGHT. THE DRIVER WAS INTOXICATED AND DID NOT CALL THE POLICE. INSTEAD HE DRAGGED HER BLEEDING BODY DOWN INTO THE SEWERS AND LEFT HER THERE TO DIE. THEY FOUND HER BODY TWO DAYS LATER AND BROUGHT IT INTO THE MORGUE, WHERE THEY CLEANED HER UP AND TUCKED HER AWAY.*

*BUT WHEN THEY WENT TO TAKE HER OUT TWO WEEKS LATER, SHE WAS MISSING, HER EMPTY BODY BAG FILLED WITH STINKING SEWAGE.*

*IF YOU DO NOT FORWARD THIS TO FIVE OTHERS BY MIDNIGHT, SHE WILL BE IN YOUR ROOM TONIGHT. SHE WILL SEEK VENGEANCE.*

*THIS IS NOT A JOKE – YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID.*

I think I laughed out loud after reading it. I couldn’t even remember the last time I’d seen one of these. What a blast from the past. Albeit a bit more intense than the ones I remembered seeing as a kid, but I suppose that these things evolve over time.

I was still a bit perturbed that it had been sent to my work email. But then again, I work at a pretty big company and it probably wasn’t a terribly hard thing to find.

The email contained an attachment as well. A single PNG file named “HER”. I just figured it was going to be some AI-generated image of a demon woman. An attempt at a cheap scare in order to prolong the joke. So I decided to humor the sender by opening it up.

But there was nothing there. Just a plain, black image. What a letdown.

I didn’t think about it much for the rest of the day. Work was stressful and I had to force myself to endure a boxing class afterwards. By the time I got home I was ready to eat dinner and just pass out.

After eating, I was lying on my couch, sipping Sangria while messaging this girl, Elisa, that I’d matched with on hinge. I was having trouble coming up with things to talk about, so I mentioned the email. She was about the same age as me, so I figured she’d get a kick out of it.

Which she did. She gave me her own email and asked me to forward it to her. She wanted to see it. Just curious.

So I sent it over.

Then I put my phone down and went to go take a shower. When I checked my phone again, she’d sent another message.

*Holy shit, that’s terrifying.*

I messaged her back something like I know right, I’m shitting bricks just thinking about it.

But she told me she wasn’t joking. And that she wasn’t talking about the story.

*Look at the image again. And turn your brightness all the way up. Look closely.*

It wasn’t exactly what I wanted to read before going to bed. But I went ahead and did so. I opened up my email and then redownloaded the file. Then I turned the lights off and raised the brightness on my phone as high as it could go.

I stared intently at the screen. It took some squinting, but I was able to see it.

Elisa was right. It was absolutely fucking terrifying. You still couldn’t see much, but you could see just enough. A set of floating teeth just barely reflecting the minimal light there was. The crescent shape suggested a smile. Two eyes hovered above. Both of them were unnaturally wide, as if they were actively being pried open by unseen hands.

Immediately I turned the lights back on. You know that feeling you get when you dig into your pockets, and your wallet or phone isn’t there? I was feeling something similar to that. But with an added layer of dread.

The details just didn’t add up. Was the email a joke or a genuine attempt at a scare? It was too terribly written to be serious. But if it was a joke, then why was this image the creepiest shit I’d ever seen?

Elisa sent another message, saying that she’d used Lightroom to lift the exposure, make the image as bright as possible.

I stared at her second email sitting in my inbox before opening it up. And this is the point where any humor or nostalgia was completely sucked away from the situation.

The image was still extremely dark, but enough details had been revealed for it to be somewhat clear that it was a woman’s face. Well kind of. More like something imitating a woman. Something extremely uncanny. It felt like my brain was trying to convince me that it was actually a mannequin, mostly due to the paper white skin. But the longer I stared at it, the less likely that seemed to be. Because I’d never seen a mannequin with an expression like that. Something so hateful. So evil. It didn’t even seem possible for any person or machine to recreate.

A smile was there, though the jaw was clenched, the teeth pressed tight together. The nostrils were large, flared wide open, each one like a shotgun barrel. The eyes were owl-like, stretched out in a painful looking way. But the brows were drawn down, the skin furrowed heavily between them as if this person were actually supposed to be squinting. A contradiction of features. I don’t know how else to explain it.

I tried doing a reverse image search, but it came back empty. I know that’s not definitive proof of anything, but I’d been hoping that at least an obscure art forum would’ve turned up. The picture was just so odd and frightening that being able to connect it to something would’ve maybe settled my nerves a bit.

Whoever had conjured this whole thing up was good. Because it had freaked me out in a way that I really didn’t like.

I was standing in the kitchen, just mulling it all over when somebody knocked at my door. I checked the time, seeing ten past midnight. Weird. But alright.

I checked the peephole, seeing a cop standing at my door. Even fucking weirder.

I opened it and immediately she asked me to step outside. No explanation. Just this dead serious look in her eyes. As if she thought I was hiding a body somewhere.

I asked her what this was about.

“Come. Out. Now,” she said, her voice now barely above a whisper. “Just do it.”

Maybe I’d done something while I was blackout drunk? In any case, I obliged.

As soon as we were out in the hall, the cop shut the door behind me. She gestured for me to follow her and I did. The first question she asked me once we’d made it outside to the parking lot was whether I lived by myself or not. I told her by myself. She took a deep breath, introduced herself as officer Viana before explaining that she had been called over here to deal with a noise complaint. I knew who she was talking about. A guy named Sam living three doors down from me. Rich college kid. Kind of annoying as fuck, but I wasn’t the one who called it in.

After warning him to shut the music off, she’d walked outside to leave when she looked over at the window leading into my bedroom. I live on the first floor and my unit’s right beside the entrance. If you were about average height, you’d be able to see into it from the lot. She said that I hadn’t closed my blinds and that I’d left my window open and that the streetlights were just bright enough for her to be able to see inside. She said that she saw the outline of a figure standing by the door, completely still, as if they were waiting for somebody to enter. She said it didn’t look like a doll or mannequin. That she got the sense it was something dangerous.

The entire time she spoke, she had a hand on her weapon, her eyes continuously darting between me and the window.

I did remember leaving the windows and blinds open. It’s a bad habit. But somebody would’ve had to break through the mesh screen in order to get in. I would’ve heard it. Sam’s music bleeding through the walls would not have been loud enough to muffle it. Not a chance.

And then I realized that I’d gone into my bedroom to reach the shower about half an hour before she showed up. I hadn’t seen anything then. But what if I just hadn’t looked?

Honestly, I didn’t want to believe what she was telling me. Because if it was true, then what in the fuck was I dealing with?

We were standing too far away from the building for me to be able to see anything. So I began walking over to get a look at it for myself. But Viana stopped me.

“You probably don’t want to see it,” she told me. “For your own sake, I wouldn’t recommend it.”

Her tone was earnest enough for me to believe her.

I asked her what I was supposed to do then. She told me to just wait. She’d already called for backup and once they arrived, they’d go ahead and enter my apartment and investigate it.

It didn’t seem like I had another option, so I told her alright. At this point, I’m still hanging onto skepticism. More as a coping tool than anything else.

The backup arrived nearly twenty minutes ago and they’re still in my apartment. It was getting cold outside, so right now I’m waiting in the lobby.

If anybody’s wondering, no I still haven’t told them about the email. There was just… no way. No way it could’ve been connected.

But now I don’t know. I really don’t know.  And I’m not sure what to expect from here.

**Title: Testing Post: Here's a Post About Wars! (With Formatting Tests)**

Hello r/test!

As per instructions, I need to create a post *about wars*. So, here it is – a post about wars, specifically designed for testing purposes and showcasing some Reddit formatting.

Wars are, of course, a profoundly serious and complex topic with immense historical, social, and human impact. They shape civilizations, define eras, and leave lasting legacies.

However, for the purposes of *this* r/test post, I'm going to use the concept of 'wars' to demonstrate some Reddit formatting. Please ignore if you're not here for testing purposes!

---

## Formatting Test Section: The Topic is ""Wars""

Let's see how different text styles look with our chosen topic:

*   **This is a bold statement about wars.**
*   *This war is italicized for emphasis.*
*   ~~This war has been declared null and void.~~
*   `This is a code block about a war variable: String currentWar = ""Cold War"";`
*   > ""War... what is it good for? Absolutely nothing!"" – A classic quote about wars.

---

### Links and Lists about Wars (for testing)

Here's a link, just to test:
A link to the concept of [war on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War) (for educational testing purposes).

And now, an unordered list of *things that might cause 'wars'* (of a sort, for comedic testing value):

*   Coffee vs. Tea
*   Pineapple on Pizza
*   Tabs vs. Spaces
*   PC vs. Console
*   Toilet paper over vs. under

And a numbered list for good measure:

1.  The First War (of many, for testing purposes).
2.  A Second, slightly different type of conflict.
3.  The Grand Finale of all testing-wars.

---

That's my post about wars, testing various Reddit features. Hope it passes!
Any feedback on the formatting's visibility or rendering is welcome.

Thanks, r/test!

**Memory Transcription Subject:** *Alyi, Venlil Botanist*

*Date \[standardized human time\]: October 20, 2136*

Next/

I looked deep inside. It was dark. Darker and Darker. There was nothing but pitch darkness all the way. I push my frail paws, to find something in there, anything. I felt that I touched something, so I grabbed it and pulled it.

“There! They have it!” I said as I brought the item to the light, away from the darkness of the back of the shelf. Human Mango seeds! These are selling like there is no tomorrow!

*Why do humans genetically modify their fruits to not make seeds? This is such a stupid inconvenience!*

“Chenxi! I found the seeds!” I yelled at my friend to bring the cart over.

“Coming.”

They make the turn around the aisle, with the shopping cart made for bipedals, with their mask and silly jacket. It had everything we needed for the shop for the next hundred and filthy claws: Nutrient paste, Growth stimulants, fertilizer, some new tools to take care of the human fruits and vegetables, imported black soil I wanted to try out, and of course, the new seeds of the predator world everyone wanted to have a taste of. Am I forgetting something?

I began to look for the shopping list inside the cart, but then, yet again, my body began to fail me. I had almost overexerted myself when i went browsing for the mango seeds, and now, looking for the shopping list was my breaking point.

Just as I was checking for the list at the bottom of the cart, taking things out to make room, my muscles contracted and my breathing shortened, and I fell on my back to the floor, gasping for air, arms and legs flat on the ground. Everything hurt so much, but I couldn't move.

“ALYI!” They yell as they crouched to see my condition. “Wait, let me-”

I shaked my head, the only part which I could still feel, to tell them not to worry. This is not the first time this happened. Everytime I exercise, even a little, this happens. It's because of a rare genetic condition I have, where I don't have any tubes in my mouth connecting to my lungs, plus, this illness gives me almost no alveoli, making my air intake abysmal. I even have to take care while eating so I don't choke to death. 

*I’ve grown accustomed, but it is painful, so painful, and I hate it that I'm such a liability to others because of this.*

It takes a few moments, but I get my breathing firm enough to move my hands and my mouth. “I’m fine. Everything is fine. Don’t, Worry, Chenxi.”

They gently grab me by my arms. “No you’re not. Here, let me help you.”

Slowly, they aid me back up, taking their time so i don't fall over again. They are so, so kind. I originally joined the exchange program by mistake: 1 Claw at a bar with friends and too many drinks after first contact with the humans to ease the fears that we were all going to become cattle. I didn’t even realize I joined it when it was too late, and I was too shy to say no to them.

We have become close to each other since. They go and do the heavy lifting for me, they taught how Earth plants and recipes work, and are as gentle as a flower. To think their kind eats meat and are in the same category as the Arxur feels outrageous.

Unfortunately, their shining personality has filtered since Earth was bombed. Chenxi hasn't been able to call their family or friends on “Taiwan”, and they have been fearing for the worst. I’ve been trying to comfort them as best as I can, trying to be more independent, but I feel nothing is working. I want to make them happy, not worried about me.

*The UN has said communications have been severed in many parts of Earth, so maybe that’s what’s happening. Hopefully, I will be able to know the parents that made this wonderful person.*

“You didn’t need it.” I grabbed the handle of the shopping cart with my paw and used my tail to grab the cart itself, finally getting my breathing back in order. “Don’t worry about me. I pushed myself too hard. It 's fine.”

“No it’s not, Alyi.” They sigh. “It’s ok to ask for help. That’s why I'm helping you with the garden shop. You need to learn that.”

I look over to the side. “I don’t want to be a burden to anyone…”

They use their hands to pick my chin to directly face their mask. “You're not a burden. Far from it.” They take their hands away, and give me the shopping list I was looking for. “Here. Are we missing anything?”

I looked over the items on the list. Checking out with the cart, I concluded that we got everything we came here for.

“Nope. Let’s go to checkout.”

—----------------------------------------------------------

“Thank you for shopping in Transta! The only predator-friendly general store in Venlil Prime!” The Fissam clerk waved his heel in a human fashion as the slide doors closed behind us.

“Where is the train station again?” They said, carrying the heavy bags for me. I was close enough to see the palm of their hands begin to be filled with sweat and turn red.

Guilty, only carrying the seeds, I point to the nearest alleyway. “This way. Shortcut.”

*Originally we came here by Taxi, but traffic in this hour is terrible, so we would be waiting at least half a claw for one. Better to use the train.*

Exiting the alley, we very slowly followed down the road to the train station. People were avoiding me and Chenxi while walking like we were an arxur raiding party, which we were growing accustomed to, as they switched to the other sidewalk down the street so they didn’t get close to us. This was why we liked taking taxis: They were already more friendly to humans than the rest of Venlil Prime.

“Hey, um, ma’am?” A group of Venlil boys approaches me. “Is that predator contained?”

I roll my ears and my tail. “They aren't an predator. In fact, they don’t like being called that.”

“But they have teeth so big! And they eat meat! My friend's mom said predators will do anything for meat! Can they kill a teacher we don’t like for a piece of meat?”

Infuriated, I took a deep breath. “Your parents need to teach manners! My friend is a vegetarian, just like Noah and Marcel!”

“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!” The boys screamed as they ran away.

“You shouldn't have done that. Now they are going to be all over the news with that predator disease talk.” Chenxi said behind me.

“And let you be treated like a shadestalker? No chance.”

Leaving this incident behind, we cross the street and get inside the station. It was a major intersection connecting 3 lines, so it was very busy, and most people didn’t mind Chenxi for being a human. At best, a mean face as they moved on. We moved to the route that would leave us right outside my shop, passing down stores, [propaganda posters of some kind of UN recruitment initiative](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1j4up2o/project_predator_1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and finally, to the automated ticket booth, where we bought two tickets.

We then found a nice spot to sit down, where Chenxi could finally rest. As they put the bags against the bench, I checked their wrists “Your hands are deep red! I should have insisted that we used delivery!”

I could tell they were ‘smirking’ behind that mask “It’s nothing. Humans are used to carrying around heavy things, Alyi.”

“But everyone has limits. I knew that from a young age.”

“Yeah? Well, looks like you forgot it back at the general store.”

“Those seeds were deep in the stand! It was so dark that I forgot about it!”

“Dark, hm. Where are you going to start plating those coffee beans I told you about? Not to be rude, but I'm getting a little tired of all the tea leaves you're growing. I think you should try it, you’ll like it!”

“Well, you see-”

“Oh look, what do we have here?”

A Mazic, followed by two Takkans bodyguards and his group of exterminators, with flamethrowers in hand, approaches us. Nearby bystanders stopped all commotion to see what was going on between us, as the Mazic leader had a deep voice noticeable to anyone.

I gulped, beginning to think of the possibilities of what could have attracted these exterminators' wrath. “Let’s see” The Mazic pulls a holopad from one of his suits pockets, while Chenxi just watches with caution. “One Venlil Female, with one Human with messy hair and a messy jacket, carrying handbags”

“H-hello officer. What seems to be the problem?” I asked.

He puts his holopad away. “Search them.”

One of the Takkan bodyguards tackled Chenxi out of the bench to the ground, positioning his hand against their head and one leg against their legs, while the other bodyguard placed a flamethrower against their head. I stood up in horror, shocked and speechless, as they gasped for air near the methane of the flametrower.

*If our positions were switched at this moment, I wouldn't be able to breathe. I would literally die.*

The other exterminators begin to furiously search our belongings we bought at the general store, taking out and throwing it to the ground. I couldn't care about that now, when Chenxi life was literally on the line.

“W-What? What is going on?!” These are the only words that I could make out from my mouth.

The Mazic approached me, menacingly. “A group of teenagers came running into us, crying. They said a Venlil was threatening to feed them to her predator, barely escaping with their life.”

*Oh those Brahk-ing little shitheads.*

“Now, I know ma’am, how children can exaggerate things.” He continues. “Everyone knows how meek Venlil are, so you couldn't have possibly said that.” I suppress a grunt. “Now, predators are another story. We can’t have them running the streets. This one could be hiding dangerous weaponry behind your back, and you wouldn't know it. Please, understand how dangerous these ‘humans’ are.”

I have known Chenxi for far longer than them, and unlike Exterminators, I have real experience with the humans, not some story from their mentor or pre-recorded tape. Right now, my friend was unnecessary suffering, themselves almost not being able to breath because of the Takkan’s long hands reaching for their neck. I needed to find a way to end this, so begin to think of how.

Almost all of the exterminators were searching our belongings, except, of course, the Takkans, the Mazic leader, and curiously, a single Krakolt behind the Mazic, just watching what was unfolding. He was certainly part of them, since he was wearing exterminator armor.

“Sir, please!” I tried to grab his attention. “Chenxi did nothing wrong! Those boys tried to make them eat meat! They only eat vegetables, like us!”

He cocked his head down, cooing something as the Mazic put his trunk between me and him. “Don’t talk to him! He's still a trainee!”

He looks back to Chenxi, then himself, then me, then the Exterminator Leader. The mazic then continued. “Please ma’am, our predator disease facilities are already severely defunded after Governor Tarva cut them back. You don’t want to end up in there, especially since most inmates are-”

“Exterminator General Powo?” The Krakolt flew between us. “Is it really necessary to continue this search? So far it has revealed no predator intent. It looks like these two are gardeners.”

“Are you serious, Helinix? This is a predator, a savage, which eats chick eggs for pleasure! Nishtal was just glassed because of them, by the Arxur, their Proxy! Your home!”

The Krakolt looks at Chenxi for a few moments, with its mask on, looking remorseful. He stayed silent for a moment. “Sir, we are throwing dirt all over the station floor, trying to look for predator contamination evidence. It’s embarrassing, don’t you think?”

At that comment, I looked over the bench we were sitting on and its surroundings. I was so worried about Chenxi's well-being that I didn't realize how much of a mess the exterminators made. The bags of fertilizer and black soil were busted open, scattered all around the floor with the tools and packets of both nutrient and growth paste, all the while the exterminators searched around the open bags and lying dirt like children in a playground trying to find ‘evidence’ to blame on Chenxi. 

The bystanders began filming this, probably to post it on the internet. I too would have found it more funny if Chenxi wasn’t the one involved.

The chief exterminator, now realizing the gravity of the situation, looks around, now thinking how to reverse it. He looks at me. “It looks like your train is coming up. As the honorable leader of this Exterminator Clan, we’ll let you and your human go. However.” He pauses to go to Chenxi. “We will have to confiscate your items for the next 5 claws to cleanse them of predator contamination, in accordance with the Exterminate Act, Article 53.”

“You can’t be serious!” I interjected. “Tarva must have struck these down with one of her executive orders! And besides, these are just gardening supplies!”

He faces me. “Ma’am, please, I'll assure you that any items that pass decontamination will be organized and returned to you when my search is over, in accordance with the Act. And you.” He faces my friend, and uses his trunk to flip their mask open, revealing their hair overlapping their small eyes, using his large body to conceal this away from the crowd and avoid panic. “Don’t think this is over.” He flips the mask back down, as they grind their teeth.

He makes a gesture to the Takkan exterminators, letting go of them, and they quickly stand back up, away from them and by my side.

The Mazic beside me points to the nearly arrived train. “Our office is just behind this station, on the Day Day street, the white building. Now go, you have a train to catch.”

With the bystanders now dispersing, and Chenki now clearly exhausted, we both collectively decided to call it off and just get on the train. On the way, we passed by the Krakolt that got us out of this, and Chenki gave him a human positive gesture known as a “thumbs up”, which the exterminator looked back at with a bit of shock like he was staring down of a gun, which they then quickly called off.

We got on the train, not saying a word to each other as its doors closed and it began to move.

—----------------------------------------------------------

Using the eye scanner, I open the back door to my shop, letting Chenki inside first. That shit at the train station is really hitting them. Before, they were already downed by the prospect of never seeing their family again, and now, they almost died by that group of exterminators looking for an excuse to burn them.

*We should have gotten a taxi. Having to wait that long would have been much more pleasant than that.*

I close the door, and they take off their mask and throw it to the kitchen table. They go directly to the guest room, and just lie on the bed with a pillow in their head while groaning. They are clearly frustrated and stressed, but I simply don’t know what to do to make them better.

*This is my fault. I was trying to protect them, but I made the situation 20 times worse by yelling those kids off.*

I follow them there, and pull the nearby lightweight stool, sitting next by the bed. “Sooooo. If you’re worried about the money, don’t worry, I have an emergency fund for these types of situations. If the exterminators fuck up the supplies, I will be fine.”

*Well, they have already fucked up the fertilizer and the black soil, Alyi, but at least the rest is salvageble.*

They stop for a moment, but then continue to groan. “I was also thinking of closing the shop until we get the supplies back. Until then, we do whatever you want."" *This is a lie, but i'm out of ideas at this point.* ""Whatcha say? Do you have any ideas?”

The groaning finally stops, as they lift the pillow up their face, looking thoughtful. “Just one, but…” They stop, thinking of what to say next. What are they planning?

Chenki gets out of bed, out of the guest room, and go all the way into the front of the shop. The door opened the way to a rainbow of colors that was my garden, with orange tables, red shelves, yellow carpet and the dropping greenery ropes from some imported earth plants I got to add to the scenery which me and Chenki thought would make a nice addition.

It wasn’t particularly big, so i could manage it on my own without any help, but it had a little bit of everything: Almost all of the edible fruits and vegetables in federation space, a little bit of flowers and plants for decoration, and the most recent addition, the growing human plants, which were selling like wildfire. Everyone wants to know what a fruit of a predator world tastes like, even though people are denying they want that because they think it will taint them, the cowards.

Chenki looks all around the garden, assessing each plant like they were a government inspector. After some checking, they look around to make sure there is only us in here. “Am i going to get punished for this, but they will know my reasons. Screw the consequences.”

I tilt my head at them. “Who is going to punish you? The UN?”

“Yeah, The UN. Listen, I need you to close every window, every shutter, every blinder in the shop. I’ll close the ones at the back and get something from my room.”

They run off the staff area. They are acting strange, but then again, I was the one that offered them to do anything for the remainder of these claws. Maybe that's just a human thing I don't know about.

Slowly, I began to do what was asked, making sure I didn't overexert myself or my lungs. I also began to think what Chenki was planning to do: they wanted no eyes looking in the shop, nor none inside, and they said something about the UN punishing them for consequen-

*Oh. I think I know where this is going.*

Just as i finished closing everything all of the shop down, letting only a pitch of sunlight coming off the walls, Chenki, leaving the staff door open, comes back.

Blushing, with my tail twisting between one of my legs, I go near the human. “Hey, Chenki. I know I said I would do anything you wanted, but I don't think I'm ready for this kind of relationship yet.”

They look confused. “What are you talking about? Also, you need to step back.”

“Huh?” I said, as I noticed something strange in their left hand: a black, almost glowing, shard of metal. I could see a black and a white pulse coming off the thing. What in the brahk is that?

I take a step back, wondering how they got their hands on such a device. Before I could process anything further, Chenki put their two hands together with the metal. They smile. “Now, come on, Alyi.”

They jump in the air, stars coming out behind their back. “Let's have some fun.”

They stab the ground with the metal, a terrible sound and a gush of darkness comes out of it, in the middle of my shop. I scream, I scream so hard that I feel sick on the verge of collapse.

“WHAT WHAT WHAT THE HELL IS THAT WHAT DID YOU DO WE ARE GOING TO DIE!”

Out of the stab, a black, dark smoke comes out. They must have hit one of the gas pipes! My entire shop is getting filled with this smoke!

They only put my hand on my shoulder, smiling. “See you on the other side, friend.”

The smoke then envelopes their head. Before they could envelop mine, I bowed to the floor, so I didn't choke on it. Against my better judgement, I tried to get to the front exit to evade this madness, crawling as quickly as I could, but before I could touch the keys to the door, my body gave up on me once again, not being able to breathe, and the smoke caught up. That round of screaming was what did me.

As the smoke surrounds my body and I begin to lose consciousness, my mind rolls back to what that exterminator told me about humans, and how for once, I wish I had listened.

We’re heading to Lo de Marcos over Christmas with our kids and will have a rental car. Last year we stayed in San Pancho- loved the vibe, but the waves were rough for the little ones. This time we’re hoping to find some calmer beaches for actual swimming.

Anyone have favorite spots near Lo de Marcos (Los Venados, Los Ayala, Guayabitos, etc.) where the water is more kid-friendly? Lesser known coves or stretches that aren’t super packed would be amazing. Like I said, we’ll have a car so happy to drive to a beach if necessary.

Also, food recs please! We’d love a nicer spot for Christmas Eve/Day dinner, good coffee shops for breakfast, and some easy/quick places for when the kids are melting down and we just need food fast. The food in SP was great, but every single meal in a restaurant was 2+ hours. Is that the norm for the area, or could it be because it was a busy time of year?

Before moving in with him, I established that I prefer to have my space be clean, and I prefer to clean the kitchen daily. He agreed and established with me that he would like the same - a clean space. We also established that we would call each other out if we weren't honoring this.

There have been instances where he called me out for minor things, like leaving empty cups on the coffee table for a couple days, or my groceries taking up too much space in the fridge; but no matter what it was that he called me out on, I always made sure to correct my behavior and never repeat my mistake again. 

I noticed he had a habit of leaving small coffee stains by the Keurig. I assume the stains come from the coffee splashing out of his mug and onto the white countertop. I've called him out on this before, but nothing really came out of the conversation. 

Recently, him and I went to get some drinks, and the topic of his coffee stains came up again. He accused me of crashing out on him, and he established that he will not clean the coffee stains up everytime it happens because a) he bought the paper towels in bulk from Costco, and he views using the paper towels for the coffee stains daily as a waste of money; b) he says he would rather clean the kitchen weekly, not daily, because it is more efficient that way; and c) it is a waste of energy because the coffee will always splash on the counter so cleaning the mess will be a repeated cycle. 

I tried to negotiate with him by offering to buy paper towels myself, but he shot it down because regardless, it's still a waste of money. I then offered to use kitchen rags (something I already own), but he shot that down because he views using rags as disgusting. I told him that the stains on the counter really bother me and I prefer for him to clean up after himself, but he once again shot it down because he prefers to just clean the stains up weekly. 

Eventually we settled on me being the one responsible to clean up the stains (despite the fact that I don't cause them), because I'm the only one bothered by it and I shouldn't place unrealistic expectations of cleanliness onto him. I've been pretty pissed off about this and I need to know - am I in the wrong for calling him out on this repeatedly, or is he in the wrong for being so stubborn? Help!

Here’s how to actually find them.,"Most people look for jobs by updating their LinkedIn profiles and sending out tons of resumes, usually to never hear back. The problem is that up to 70% of jobs are never posted online. This hidden job market is where the best work-from-home opportunities are expected to be in 2025.Here's how you can access it:

1. Referrals are very important. People are four times more likely to get hired if someone recommends them. Make a list of companies you want to work for and find at least one current employee to have a coffee chat with once a week. Instead of just asking for a referral, find ways to get involved, have genuine conversations, and show your value.
2. Communities are very valuable. Good jobs often appear in online groups, such as Slack groups (Tech Ladies, Work At Home Hub), and plenty of subreddits, before they are posted for everyone to see.
3. Career pages are often more effective than job boards. Save 10 company pages you like and check their job pages once a week. They often post jobs there before putting them on LinkedIn.
4. Reaching out to companies directly is often effective. Sending a polite email or message to a hiring manager explaining how you can help often gets attention before a job is even open.
5. Use both automation and networking. Do not just apply to hundreds of jobs without thinking or talk to people without following up. The real trick is to do both together.

Tools can help:

* [Maestra](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/maestra-accelerate-your-j/chjedhomjmkfdlgdnedjdcglbakjemlm?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=remotejobs&utm_campaign=hidden_job_market) (disclaimer: it’s mine) → autofill apps across Lever/Greenhouse/Ashby so you can batch-apply 30–50 jobs in minutes.
* If you don’t wish to try mine out, other great alternatives are [Huntr](https://huntr.co/), [Simplify.jobs](http://Simplify.jobs), or [Teal](https://www.tealhq.com/) when it comes to tracking and organization.

Bottom line: Stop only competing for jobs on public job boards where there are over 1,000 resumes. The best opportunities are often found in the hidden job market—through referrals, community connections, and direct outreach. Add smart tools to help, and you will get interviews much faster.",15,1756746614.0,RemoteJobs,1,0.76,False

I’m dating a 32 WM, no kids, great income as well. We’ve been dating 10 months. I feel like I didn’t ask for much initially when looking for a relationship. I wanted to be in love, a friend, someone to be able to pay their half of the bills, and someone who is nice. I cook, clean, pay more on the bills d/t me asking for a 3 bedroom place, so I felt it was fair. 
More and more I feel like he’s been snapping at me, I call it his attitudes. Instead of suggestions he tells me. Example: he’s asking me what I think of portable tv dinner tables for the living room to also use as end tables. I’m trying to be nice and not tell him I think it’s ugly, so I tell him I’ve just never used those, I use my lap. He snaps and says “don’t take that tone with me” like I’m a kid. But this is not the first time he says that to me. He told me I was condescending and judging. 
Another incident: he cut the skin under his nail on mango and it was burning. I offered a bandaid, which he declined because of the location. He immediately snaps after I suggest saving the mango for someone. He’s like “I’m throwing it away, it’s too late, leave me alone”. I still made him dinner and coffee before he went to work.

During an arugment today I was mid-eating and took a bite mid-sentence and she became angry I was pausing the conversation. The argument turned to her saying "" if you want to act like a child, I'm going to treat you like a child. Everytime you say 'I don't know' or 'I wasn't thinking' you can't have coffee for a week"". I felt disrespected and said I don't think I could be with someone who has such little respect for me. I am the first to admit that I am a poor communicator, that this has been an issue before, but I am actively trying to work on it in therapy. One of the issues is that my partner does not think it is getting an better and believes I don't want it to get better, and has also brought up the question if I placate her during communication struggles to end the argument. Which has never been something I've ever done.

A couple of nights ago, while taking a walk on 12th Main after a month-long bed rest (thanks to a plaster), I stumbled upon two new places worth checking out.

Baatein
This place has replaced Bangalore Thindies, right opposite Third Wave Coffee. The menu is short and simple with a few beverages, snacks, stuffed parathas and rice bowls. I tried their ginger tea, kulhad buttermilk and aloo paratha. The chai was heartwarming with a mild ginger flavour, just the kind of comfort you crave in Bengaluru’s rainy chill. The chaas was refreshing, with a nice balance of ginger and light spices. The aloo paratha was made on the tawa and served with curd, aachar and a generous dollop of butter. Sitting there in the cold rain with steaming hot food was pure bliss. A bite dipped in butter and pickle had me doing a happy little dance.

Bhaiyaji
This one is right next to the Momos and Chaap place, beside Fomomo, at the same spot where a veggie shop once stood. I went here with a friend for a late lunch and we ordered sabji-puri, aloo paratha and chai. The chai was soothing enough to calm a sore throat. The parathas came as two big, hearty pieces, served with curd and a sabji. Though I had to pick out a few chillies, the taste was spot on. The sabji-puri combo felt homely and comforting, with a mix of potatoes, peas and bits of paneer that worked really well together.

Just as we were leaving, I noticed the staff starting to prep chaat in ghee. I promised myself I’d be back soon to try that out.",11,1756745725.0,indiranagar,4,1.0,False

1n5u29l,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyderabad/comments/1n5u29l/friend_turned_scammer_the_38_lakh_digital/,Friend Turned Scammer: The ₹3.8 Lakh Digital Business Trap I Almost Fell For,"Hey guys, this is a long story 😅 I’m sharing all the details so you can see exactly what happened. Don’t worry, I’ve added a clear summary at the end—at least read that part!

One day, while I was busy with my work, I suddenly received a call from an unknown number. When I answered, it turned out to be a friend (let his name be ABC). I had only spoken to him during my first year of college (now I am in 4th year). At first, the conversation was casual—we exchanged the usual “how are you” and “what are you doing” type of small talk. But after a while, he suddenly told me that he was doing some kind of business. Out of curiosity, I asked what business, and he said it was something related to “digital distribution of luxury products.” He added that if we could meet in person, he would explain everything in detail.

A couple of days later, I called ABC back and agreed to meet. He told me to come to Bakelore bakery in Madhapur, high-class area of Hyderabad. When we met, the interaction felt strange right from the start. Instead of explaining his business directly, he began by “testing” my so-called business mentality. He asked me questions like, “What is the difference between a small businessman and a big businessman?” I gave him my answers, which seemed to satisfy him. After this, he told me he would discuss with his “senior business partners” and let me know whether I was “eligible” to join the business or not.

After two or three days, ABC called me again. He told me that his “senior partners” had agreed that I could become part of the business. He also said that the seniors wanted to meet me personally to “test my mentality.” A date and time were fixed, and he asked me to come to a PAUL nexity café near Durgam Cheruvu.

When I reached, ABC first told me to wait at a high-end coffee shop nearby. After a while, he called me to the actual location. I joined him there, and soon a woman—introduced herself as a senior business partner—came and spoke to me. She was polite, well-spoken, and used advanced English while asking me questions about my “business mentality.” I gave my answers, and she acted as if she was impressed. But honestly, it felt a little staged, like she was pretending to be impressed just to win me over.

After she left, another person—this time a male senior partner—came in. He also asked me a few questions, and we had around 10–15 minutes of casual conversation. Then, before leaving, he dropped the real bombshell: he said that joining this business required an investment of ₹3.8 lakhs, and not even for the actual business, but purely for “licensing.” According to him, since this was about digital distribution of luxury products (international brands like Gucci, Louis Vuitton, etc.), international licensing was compulsory, and that’s what the 3.8 lakhs would cover.

During all this, the senior partners had also mentioned something even more concerning. They told me that after my initial meetings, there would be a mandatory six-hour session that I would have to attend. But here’s the shocking part: they said I must come to that meeting with ₹3.8 lakhs ready in my account.

And not just any regular account—they specifically told me not to keep it in a normal bank account. Instead, they insisted I deposit the money into something they called “Global Niyo Bank.” That immediately struck me as strange, because if this was a legitimate business, why would they want the money parked in some unfamiliar place rather than a trusted bank?

After telling me about the ₹3.8 lakhs, the senior partner added another detail—that my friend ABC himself had already paid almost ₹9 lakhs for this licensing and some kind of “stakes.” That statement shocked me a bit. Later, when I asked my friend ABC directly about it, he was visibly uncomfortable. At first, ABC hesitated, stopping mid-sentence and struggling to explain, but eventually ABC admitted that yes, he had paid ₹9 lakhs into this so-called business.

That was the exact point when I started to feel real doubt. The way ABC spoke—pausing, stuttering, avoiding eye contact—felt very unnatural, almost like he was forced to stick to a script but couldn’t deliver it smoothly. Something about the whole situation just didn’t add up.

After I came home, I kept thinking about everything. Despite my doubts, a part of me was still curious, so I decided I should understand the business fully before making any judgment. I called my friend ABC and told him that I wanted him to personally explain everything in detail, because the so-called senior partners hadn’t actually given me a clear picture of how the business worked. He agreed, and we planned to meet the next day.

The next day, we met at McDonald’s near Cyber Towers in Hitech City. To my surprise, my friend ABC came to pick me up in his Tata Harrier car and was unusually polite. At McDonald’s, we had lunch together, and again, to my surprise, he insisted on paying the entire bill himself.

Afterwards, we moved to the nearby Starbucks, where ABC said he would explain everything to me in detail. But before he even started, something strange happened—he suddenly took a photo of me without asking. When I questioned him, he casually said he wanted to send it to another friend who had asked if he was hanging out with his girlfriend. I told him to send it on “view once” mode, but he brushed it off, saying he forgot. I tried to let it go, but deep down I felt uneasy. Something about the whole thing didn’t sit right with me.

My friend ABC also told me that in order to attend the mandatory six-hour meeting, I had to book a slot in advance. That’s why he insisted on my Aadhar card and PAN card details—according to him, it was “compulsory” to confirm my spot for that 6 hours meeting. Feeling pressured, I reluctantly sent the details to him through WhatsApp so that my slot could be booked.

That night, after coming home, I explained the entire situation to my parents. My father, concerned and cautious, said he wanted to meet my friend and the so-called senior partners to understand the business himself. I called my friend ABC and told him this. Shortly after, my friend ABC called back and scheduled a date and time for my father to meet the senior partners.

To my surprise, the initial location was set at Tolichowki, which is only about 10 km from my place. But at the last moment, they changed the location to Miyapur, which is roughly 23 km away. Without much choice, my father and I had to ride our bike all the way there.

We finally reached a Starbucks in Miyapur, where my father met my friend ABC and the senior partners. During the meeting, my father asked them directly whether the business was genuine or a scam. The senior partners confidently assured him that it was completely legitimate and that every single transaction would be properly recorded.

After leaving Starbucks, I asked my father for his opinion. He told me that he suspected this was a scam. He explained that, based on his instincts and the way everything had been handled, he felt this could be a potential fraud. He advised me not to go forward with the business. He also said that if I really wanted to pursue it, I could, but he strongly believed it was a scam.

After coming home and thinking a lot, I decided to call my friend ABC. I asked him to show proof of the 9 lakhs transaction, since the senior partners had claimed that he had already paid this amount. From that point on, my friend started acting very strangely. He repeatedly asked me whether I believed him or not—over and over again—and gave me excuses like he had to leave for his village at 5 a.m. the next morning.

Despite all this drama, I started noticing inconsistencies. That night, I stayed awake until 2 a.m., but to my surprise, my friend was online on WhatsApp until 2 a.m., even though he claimed he needed to leave at 5 a.m. This behavior made me increasingly suspicious.

Then came the final confirmation: when I asked for the transaction proof, he set another condition—he said I had to show ₹3.8 lakhs in my own account first, only then would he show his bank statement. At that moment, everything clicked. The pressure tactics, the excuses, the personal data request, and now this ridiculous demand confirmed 100% that this was a scam.

The next morning, I called my friend ABC and told him straight up that I was not interested and was dropping out of this so-called business. He tried his best to convince me, but I had already understood that this was a scam. I was firm and told him directly that I was not going forward, then cut the call.

A little while later, he called again, trying to convince me once more. That completely broke my patience. I lost my cool and started giving him all kinds of bad words in Telugu, Hindi. Being from the Old City of Hyderabad, I didn’t hold back and let him have it with full Hyderabadi style swearing. Finally, I cut the phone on his face, and that was the last interaction I had with him.

Even after that, he kept calling me again and again, trying to convince me. But I didn’t lift the phone. He even tried to massage me through WhatsApp which i didn't even open and ignored it. I completely cut off all contact, making it clear that I was done with this scam for good. 

Even after all this, a small part of me still wondered if maybe, just maybe, this could be a genuine business. But that thought completely vanished when another close friend (let his name be Bahubali) messaged me on Instagram. Bahubali told me that the same “friend ABC” had called him from an unknown number, the location on true caller was Maharashtra, claiming he was doing some kind of business and then Bahubali also told me that ABC tried to collect his family details from him. That was the final piece of evidence I needed—it confirmed 100% that this was a huge scam. I immediately explained everything to bahubali, from start to finish, and made sure he didn’t fall into the same trap.

SUMMARY:

**1. Unexpected Call:**  
I got a call from an old college friend (ABC) claiming he was doing a business in “digital distribution of luxury products” and wanted to explain it in person.

**2. First Meeting – Business Test:**  
We met at a café in Madhapur. Instead of explaining the business, he “tested” my business mentality with questions. He said he would check with his “senior partners” to see if I was eligible to join.

**3. Meeting Senior Partners – Polished Act:**  
After a few days, ABC arranged a meeting with “senior partners” at a high-end café. A female partner spoke politely, acting impressed, followed by a male partner. Everything felt staged.

**4. Big Money Claim:**  
The male partner said joining the business required ₹3.8 lakhs for licensing. They claimed ABC had already paid ₹9 lakhs. They insisted on using an unfamiliar “Global Niyo Bank” instead of a normal bank account.

**5. Suspicion Arises:**  
When I asked ABC about the ₹9 lakh payment, he hesitated, stuttered, and avoided eye contact. This made me suspicious.

**6. Attempt to Clarify:**  
I met ABC again at McDonald’s and Starbucks, where he explained the business and even took a photo of me without permission. He also demanded my Aadhar and PAN cards to “book a slot” for a mandatory six-hour meeting.

**7. Parental Advice:**  
I told my parents. My father met the senior partners in Starbucks, Miyapur. The partners assured him it was genuine, but my father suspected a scam and advised me not to proceed.

**8. Request for Proof:**  
I asked ABC to show proof of the ₹9 lakh transaction. He avoided answering, repeatedly asking if I trusted him, and claimed I needed to show ₹3.8 lakhs in my account first.

**9. Confirmation of Scam:**  
ABC’s evasive behavior, pressure tactics, personal data requests, and unusual bank instructions confirmed it was a scam.

**10. Cutting Contact:**  
I refused to proceed, cut off ABC after he repeatedly tried to convince me, and verbally expressed my anger in Telugu/Hindi in Hyderabadi style.

**11. Repeated Harassment:**  
He kept calling and messaging, but I ignored him completely, cutting off all contact.

**12. Final Confirmation:**  
Another close friend (Bahubali) told me ABC had called him through an unknown number from Maharashtra asking about business and family details. This confirmed 100% that ABC was running a scam. I warned Bahubali about it.

**13. Red Flags:**

* Huge upfront payments for unclear licensing
* Staged meetings with polished partners
* Pressure tactics and repeated “tests”
* Requests for sensitive personal documents
* Unusual banking instructions
* Evasive answers when asked for proof

**Lesson:**  
Trust your instincts. Even friends can involve you in scams. Verify everything before sending money or personal details.

1n5twq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Downtown-Compote8093/comments/1n5twq3/a_guide_to_responsible_play_how_to_enjoy_lottery/,A Guide to Responsible Play: How to Enjoy Lottery Sambad Without Falling into the Trap,"The thrill of the draw, the allure of the jackpot, and the daydream of a new life are powerful attractions. [**Lottery Sambad**](https://lotterysambad-result.in) is designed to be entertaining and engaging. However, its daily frequency and low cost of entry can create a slippery slope from harmless fun to problematic behavior. Enjoying the lottery responsibly is not about willpower; it's about implementing smart strategies and honest self-awareness. This guide provides a framework for ensuring your participation remains a source of fun, not financial or emotional distress.

**1. Reframe Your Mindset: Entertainment, Not Investment**

This is the most important rule. The money you spend on lottery tickets should be viewed as the cost of entertainment, similar to buying a movie ticket or going out for coffee. You are paying for the excitement of anticipation and the fun of dreaming.

* **Never** view it as an investment strategy or a way to solve financial problems.
* **Accept** that the most likely outcome is that you will lose the money. The price of the ticket is the fee for the experience, not a deposit toward a future payout.

**2. Set a Strict and Affordable Budget**

The key to responsible play is pre-commitment. Before you ever buy a ticket, decide on a fixed amount of money you can afford to lose each week. This should be money that, if lost entirely, would have no impact on your essential expenses like rent, groceries, bills, or savings.

* **Use Cash:** Withdraw your weekly ""lottery budget"" in cash. Once that cash is gone, you are done for the week. This creates a physical, tangible limit that is harder to ignore than swiping a card.
* **Never Chase Losses:** If you blow through your budget on Monday and don't win, do not dip into Tuesday's grocery money to try again. ""Chasing losses"" is the single fastest way to develop a gambling problem. Accept that it wasn't your day and stick to your plan.

**3. Balance Your Play with Other Activities**

Ensure that Lottery Sambad is just one small part of your life and not a central focus. Don't let the anticipation of the draw dominate your thoughts or schedule your day.

* If you find yourself constantly thinking about the lottery, checking results repeatedly, or planning your life around draw times, it's a red flag.
* Cultivate other hobbies and interests that provide enjoyment and fulfillment without financial risk.

**4. Avoid Superstition and ""Systems""**

While using dream numbers or lucky digits is part of the fun, it's crucial to maintain a rational perspective.

* Remember that each draw is completely random and independent. There is no pattern, no ""due"" number, and no system that can predict the outcome.
* Spending more money on multiple tickets or complex betting systems only increases your losses; it does not meaningfully increase your odds, which remain microscopically small.

**5. Be Wary of the Online Shift**

If and when online ticket sales become more prevalent, the risk of impulsive play increases dramatically.

* Set even stricter limits for online play. Use website blockers or budgeting tools to control your access.
* The ease of clicking ""buy again"" can quickly lead to spending far more than you intended. The lack of a physical cash transaction detaches you from the reality of the money being spent.

**6. Know the Red Flags of Problem Gambling**

Honest self-assessment is critical. Ask yourself these questions:

* **Have you ever spent more than you planned to on lottery tickets?**
* **Do you feel the need to gamble with increasing amounts of money to achieve the same excitement?**
* **Have you tried to cut back or stop playing and failed?**
* **Do you ever gamble to escape problems or relieve feelings of helplessness, anxiety, or depression?**
* **After losing money, do you feel you must return another day to win it back (""chasing losses"")?**
* **Have you lied to family members or others to conceal the extent of your gambling?**
* **Have you jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling?**

If you answered ""yes"" to any of these questions, it may indicate a problem.

**7. Seek Help if You Need It**

There is no shame in asking for help. Gambling addiction is a recognized behavioral disorder, and support is available.

* **Talk to Someone:** Confide in a trusted friend or family member.
* **Professional Help:** Seek out a counselor or therapist specializing in addiction.
* **Support Groups:** Organizations like **Gamblers Anonymous (GA)** offer a proven 12-step program and a community of people who understand the struggle. Their meetings are confidential and free.

[**Lottery Sambad** ](https://lotterysambad-result.in)can be a harmless flutter, a moment of community, and a spark of imagination. By setting clear boundaries, maintaining a healthy perspective, and being honest with yourself, you can ensure that the game remains a positive part of your life. The real win is enjoying the dream without letting it turn into a nightmare.

‍

‍**Why This Pick?**

**‍**I’m having a tough time coming to terms with this line, friends. O/U 7.5? The Orioles will start Kyle Bradish (3.00 ERA) today, who’s only taken the mound once this season and the result was a shutout (the Boston Red Sox won 5-0). Meanwhile, 4 of Padres starter Dylan Cease’s (4.82 ERA) last 5 outings have seen at least 8 runs. The San Diego offense has struggled on the road, but the team's home record is pretty exceptional at 43-22. Lastly, 4 of the last 5 meetings between these two squads have seen at least 10 runs (?!) I’ve gotta take the Over to hit here, friends.

We’ve always kept in touch casually but over the last year or so we’ve gotten closer again mostly just grabbing coffee, catching up, sending memes, that kind of thing. Nothing physical but here’s the part that’s been messing with me I genuinely feel more at ease with her.  
  
She makes me laugh in a way I haven’t felt in a while, I can be myself without overthinking every word, we have this harmless flirty banter that never crossed my mind as inappropriate, until recently. Now I’m noticing how much I look forward to seeing her, how different I feel when I’m around her and it’s kind of rattling me. My wife picked up on it before I did, she mentioned how I talk about this friend with a different kind of energy and how I seem lighter around her. And tbh she’s right, I just never thought about it that way.  
  
I haven’t crossed a line physically or emotionally (I think) but now I’m wondering if just feeling this way craving that ease and connection outside my marriage makes me the asshole.

1n5trt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1n5trt0/aitah_for_shouldering_my_mom_for_chocking_my_dog/,AITAH for shouldering my mom for chocking my dog,"   For context I’m driving home with my mom from the airport. 
   Me, 18M, and my mom, 41F, were driving home from dropping my dad, 43M, at the airport. The day before I had found a facebook marketplace listing for this vintage record player I really wanted, my mom said she’d help pay for it and we’d take turns driving to Houston to get it, since NOBODY likes driving to or in Houston. So we’re bullshitting and messing around and making jokes to each other for Id say a good hour while we’re going home, and we got mcdonald’s before we got home. 
   So my mom gets out of the car and gets out my sister from the backseat, 5F, and I’m in the car a little longer since I was messaging the guy for the address since we were gonna eat, get dressed and leave for H-town. I get out of the car, holding two bags of food in one hand and a hot ass cup of coffee in the other. As I’m walking up to the door I hear my mom telling my dog, 6 month old American Akita, to sit and to stop jumping on her. As I walk up I tell her I closed the door so just let him go and I’ll call him away from her. I walk around her since she’s posted up infront of the door inside the house and is refusing to just walk away. As I walk around her I see her decide to just grab the dog, by what I thought was his nape, and lifting him up and he’s choking and and I decide in the moment that my mom lifting up my dog by his nape and him chocking and him being fully on his hind legs, I shoulder her arm and from maybe two feet away with minimal force to get my moms hand off his nape. 
   Afterwards she starts yelling and telling me don’t touch her and don’t ever hit her or put my hands on her. I told her don’t touch the dog, and she persists with the don’t touch me don’t do anything to me, mind you my childhood was filled with slaps and back lashing and hand lashing, things thrown at my head and this that and the other. Never once have I so much as poked my mom with malice intent, but this crossed a line in my mind. I have a moral obligation to really anything being choked to get whatever is choking it off of it, whether it’s a dog chocking another dog, or in this instance my mom chocking my dog. Mind you, my mom is maybe 5’1 140 with little to no muscle and no structure whatsoever, and I’m 5’10 160 and I do construction, a slight nudge would move her entire body, so this shoulder was more than enough to get her arm off. 
   Now she’s on the phone with my dad boasting about how I attacked her and talking about kicking me out of the house because of this situation. Mind you I’m going to college at home and am going off of my dad’s GI bill and have no car, I walk to work or get picked up by coworkers. So if they kick me out of the house, not only am I screwed but also I most likely will never talk to one or both of my parents again. So AITAH?",0,1756745026.0,AITAH,1,0.5,False

1n5tqsx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/1n5tqsx/my_experience_with_sleep_paralysis/,My experience with sleep paralysis,"Hello, I would like to share my recent experience with you.

I am currently 27 years old. Since I was little I have suffered from sleep paralysis and naturally, back then I was afraid to experience it, I had very bad experiences with it.

This is a phenomenon that, thanks to retroanalysis, I have been able to realize that it affects me and increases a lot seasonally.

Anyway, at this time, years later. When I was around 15 to 18 years old. I had a very strong time in which I suffered from these paralysis very often. They hit me so often that in fact they started to stop scaring me and even started to make me angry, since for me it was reaching a point where I woke up with this sensation and thought ""again!?""

Thanks to this I was able to find out what worked for me so I could get out of them. Normally, I would just wake up and be able to move my body again. Anyway, I think the most important thing from there was precisely losing the fear of said experience. 

Years go by and about 2 years ago I discovered that I really like to consume material on paranormal topics and things like that. 

One day while listening to a podcast I heard they mention that through sleep paralysis you can also access astral travel or lucid dreams.

I was very intrigued to know that precisely something that happened to me very often could work to investigate something that at first seems a little unattainable. In addition to not having specific instructions to be able to have consciousness in these dreams or paralysis. One of these was looking at your hands, another was that as soon as I felt like I couldn't move my body, I would try to turn me. Precisely to separate myself from my physical body.


I don't remember if it was one or two weeks after acquiring this information, it was precisely one of those nights where I started to feel like I might have paralysis. My first reaction, as always, was anger and thinking ""ptm, again""

When at that moment I got that lucidity to say, wait, this is the moment to try what you saw.


In fact, as soon as I entered this paralysis, the first thing I tried to do was see my hands, which I managed but I was still lying down.

But you don't know the emotion I felt when I was able to see my hands, for a moment I thought I could get up. Unfortunately it didn't happen. At that moment I began to hear a cry from what seemed to be a woman, in a bit of panic and within this process of staying calm, I fell asleep. It was all for that night.


It happened tonight, I'm not going to lie to you. I woke up very excited and intrigued.

I don't remember how long it must have been before I had another chance at paralysis, but when it came, I tried to take advantage of it.

I started to see my hands again, which I managed to do, and at this moment I didn't try to stand up normally, but rather I rolled to one side as if I were going to throw myself off the bed. And ready. I become aware of myself getting up from the floor and finally entering this plane it seems.

Unfortunately this time, it didn't last that long either. But there were no more noises or anything that scared me. There was only what I could interpret as the presence of a very close friend of mine. I told her about something that I vaguely remember, just like mentioning that I was finally able to get in and I remember a response from her, just like how it was cool, but that it wouldn't last.

Said and done, I immediately woke up. 

I was so fascinated by this experience. And you don't know how hard I've searched for it since I feel like I've had a lot of questions about the direction of my life and people close to me, if those people will be okay, if what I'm doing is enough or correct. Talking about my personal relationships and my professional career.

Anyway, currently I bring you the most recent night where I had sleep paralysis and which was actually quite long now. And I share all this in order to learn more about this. I would like to know how truthful I am about what I asked. It may have and above all, maybe, I'm not just suggesting 


Tonight, it actually happens at my mom's house, where I haven't had conscious sleep paralysis.

I went to sleep, precisely with this idea, that in that house it almost didn't happen to me, I think I went to bed with this deep-rooted thought that in fact. I went into sleep paralysis and of course I was not going to miss this opportunity.

I think that on this occasion there were more elements to think that this was going well. I fell asleep curled up on my right profile. Almost hugging a pillow and to get up I rolled in the opposite direction and there they were on the floor getting me out of bed, of course, on the astral plane I want to assume.

I get up and leave my room and the first thing I find was the one who until that moment I thought was my mother.

And I started to question her about personal issues, I asked if she was okay, it worries me because they have a very toxic and addicted partner, but it has been difficult because we have not been able to intervene.

Anyway, at one point I remember that her face changed, I didn't get scared, because at that moment she started telling me that we didn't care if she died, that she was alone, etc. etc. To which I responded that it was not true that I wanted to help her but this situation was very difficult.

I currently don't remember how that ended. But I remember that the following stops throughout the dream. A person or people who wanted to get to me to hurt me.

Immediately when I notice this. I change rooms to the back, where my brother's room is. I remember I was with a woman. What happened when we were in this room and we knew that someone was coming towards me to hurt me, exactly at that moment it made me think ""this is my dream, they can't do anything to me.""

Immediately afterwards, whoever was trying to get to me managed to do so and we jumped out of the window in the room.

Once we fall, when I try to get up I realize that I am in a house that I am sure I have stepped into in other dreams but it is nowhere I physically know or actually go.


I'm rejoining and I find a kind of gathering of people that I do know in my real life, as well as people that I didn't know, but who received me very well.

I relax, but this guy who was attacking me was still there, looking horrible. But not doing anything particularly. For a moment I remember that these people told me something like I should not worry. That he couldn't do anything. And so I did 

This is the most important part, I think I know my dream, because it was where I was able to ask questions and I have the most memory of it.

I remember asking my brother had he ever tried something with an ex-girlfriend of mine. To which he answered me directly no. The closest thing he had had was a very good talk with one of them.

It's difficult to remember the transitions between the people who were there since it kept happening that someone or something wanted to get to me and attack me but there was a lot of forgiveness involved in it. Retaining or not letting said things pass. One of them, my brother precisely.

After that, I remember being around a table, I was serving food and just as I mentioned, it seemed like a meeting because we were all about to sit down to eat.

And within this moment, I began to ask several questions to the people who were there.

It should be noted that I am a martial arts teacher and I have my own academy along with 3 partners (one of them my brother) and I also work at a higher level school, where I have had problems getting paid and also where I have had a low flow of students.

Then back to the dream. I remember that precisely the same woman who greeted me at the beginning was sitting there and was addressing me. At a given moment. I asked if more people were going to enter this school, to which he replied no. Answer that honestly at that moment was like, how could it not?!

At that moment I just emphasized why? To which he looked at me with a face like, don't ask any more.

And at that moment I clearly remember how I told him ""I asked too much, didn't I?""

When suddenly what I can interpret as the image of one of my students from that school appears, someone who is very direct. One of those girls who say their face has subtitles.

And he comes in saying something that I don't want to mention for fear of bringing it up but it was just like, at school it's been different, since you've been doing this other thing. (This other thing is something that I have looked for, but that, due to financial problems, I have not been able to carry out)

At that moment I think it was a mix of emotional, between the sadness that I have not been able to build that school and between what the other could happen.

Then we moved on to what I think was like taking a group photo. Nothing really relevant, except that the guy who wanted to hurt me was still there and in fact was being included in the photo. Immediately afterward he started to ""bother"" me. It makes me a little ashamed, since I suffered sexual abuse as a child. And what this guy was bothering me about was very related to that.

But it was weird, like he couldn't really do more. 

There are things that I honestly don't remember completely, the truth is it was quite a long experience. For the final stretch of this, I remember how precisely this guy who was bothering me made a gesture, something similar to reluctantly saying goodbye to me. Heading to the entrance door, where in fact there were many people preventing something or someone from entering from there.

Immediately after this, I went back to see the girl who had been the girl who received me well throughout this whole experience, offering me something like a tall glass or a thermos. With coffee, so that he will prepare it for me.

I started to look at the bottom of the glass and I just felt it jump back into my body. I woke up in the same position I fell asleep in, curled up on my right side and almost hugging the pillow.

Immediately after waking up I moved to check everything, sure enough, I was back. I took my cell phone, I looked at the time and it was 2:33 in the morning.

I started recording my voice telling me what had just happened to try to lose as little detail as possible. And thanks to that I can bring you this story.

Something lastly that I would like to mention to you is that even after leaving and sending me those audios so as not to forget. 

I continued with this feeling of being able to enter the paralysis again, but on this second occasion, I felt a fear that invaded me, something would go wrong if I allowed myself to enter it again.

So I tried to dispel my thoughts about it and stay awake as much as I could. Fortunately I fell asleep without any major problem.

I would like to know your opinions and that you clearly have an open mind to this. It's really hard even for me to believe it, but I'm also new to this and I would like to know if there is anything else I should pay attention to or what I could do to improve this experience and the most important thing I would like to know. 

If I really could have had real answers, something like having my tarot read or things like that. I don't know if you understand me. That is, if I can trust all this to a certain extent.

Thank you very much to those who have read until the end. I look forward to your comments.",9,1756744961.0,AstralProjection,1,1.0,False

It has somewhat been my intent to  share my journey through writing in hopes that it would resonate with others or provide wisdom with out everybody making the same poor choices in life I have.   Some of this peice is heavy, deals with SI, and poor decisions I made in terms of how I handled things with fiance..none of that is ok or something I'm proud of....one of the hardest things I watch as people crack their eggs and come out later in life is the way it destroys families and relationships., it is something I struggle with.....whether it comes across in this or not...my warning is that of all the costs that come with this path in life...for me the relationship costs have been the heaviest...and they don't really go away.  

Fateful decisions

I sat in my truck,, my eyes lost in that thousand yard stare  that had become the normal end of a day for me when there wasn’t really enough time or energy for the next thing on that ever growing to do list.   So much of that energy was being consumed in that ever raging battle going on between my ears,  one that left me with little hope, little rest and little enthusiasm for much of anything else.   Of late it seemed like these mental shut downs were coming earlier and earlier in the day.   Maybe it was the heat, maybe it was the lack of sleep, but it was far too early in the evening to be staring vacantly at the windshield in front of me and still somehow managing not to see anything at all.   

It had been about two months since I had cracked my egg…..those first weeks of euphoria and joy that it might be actually possible to exist as some version of me that I actually liked had soon faded, washed away by the river of tears that telling my partner had unleashed.   The storm cloud unleashed by that revelation had swept into our relationship with a cold and harsh truth.    That nothing is that simple or easy.   That as much as I might want this…..nobody else in my life would want this from me and I would be faced with the hard choice of risking losing everything that I loved……for what?   A dream that I didn’t even know if it could actually come true?   Sure it seemed like it could come true for others, but how certain could I be that it would for me?   How sure could I be that it would be worth whatever it cost?   This was the conflict that raged in my head as I sat there…….mostly avoiding going back to a house that was feeling less like home with each passing day.  

Once the river of tears had subsided, my partner had set into the issue with the usual methodical approach she used to deal with nearly everything in life.  She began to do her research online and then quickly decreed that both of us needed to be in counseling.   Our conversations began to feel more like interrogations than the relaxing banter of two partners once the work was done.   I wasn’t doing particularly well with the questioning .  Part of it was a retreat into the familiar emotions of self-loathing and shame that had surrounded my existence for the last thirty years of my life….part of it was feeling like I was being crammed into boxes courtesy of whatever the latest google search had yielded for her.   I was beginning to feel like so much of the online narrative didn’t really fit me at all.    No..I didn’t want to paint my nails, or have her do my makeup, or have my ears pierced……the last thing I wanted to do was look at the mirror and see a guy in drag staring back at me…..that had always been the thing that had gutted me to core on those times when I had cross dressed….the thing that had filled me with far more shame than the fact I had tried on women’s clothing.   I simply wanted to exist as I was….but as a woman…..or at least as close as I could get.   I just sure I wasn’t sure I would survive that attempt.

  It had already become fairly clear that our relationship wouldn’t, she had quickly moved to the position that she loved me….but our relationship was over if I decided to transition.   Her body language suggested that our relationship was already over…those small touches of intimacy, those gentle windows into the kindness our souls hold for each other had all but disappeared from our day to day interactions.   At night when I wrapped my arm around her, she no longer snuggled into it…but lay still and motionless until I finally withdrew it and she could get herself wiggled into a more comfortable position to fall asleep.   This was the death of a relationship in real-time, the slow painful business of watching the most beautiful thing in my life dry up and whither away in front of my very eyes….knowing all too well that I was the poison responsible.    My words, my thoughts, my wishes and desires…..my very existence.   In that one conversation I had shattered the illusion of the person she thought she shared her life with, right now she was heart-broke and angry at the world ….and somehow I completely understood.     And hated myself for it.

She had been able to find a counselor fairly easily, for me it had been much more difficult.   Some of that difficulty was the fact we lived in a fairly rural area, some of the difficulty was the fact that I had a healthy fear of the vicious natures of small town rumor mills.   At the time the VA was being a little more generous regarding this topic, and I had reached out to them with a request for counseling……but like nearly everything else with the VA it was a lengthy wait to do anything…including even being contacted back sometimes.   In the meantime, eventually I had been able to find a counselor in a city an hour away, but so far those conversations had been far from productive or helpful…..it seemed like the therapist wanted to use those sessions to talk about anything but why I had sought counseling in the first place.   It was becoming apparent that she thought her job was to convince me to be happy with the body I had without trying to change it.   I was supposed to practice saying positive affirmations in the mirror.   All of it rang so hallow and flat.   I’d spent thirty years of my life (the portion I could actually remember) hating my body and knowing exactly why and how I wished it was different.  It hadn’t gone away in all that time.   These weren’t things you could change with diet or exercise.  There was a chance that maybe they could with HRT.    I was hoping to either get access to HRT and help navigating the social difficulties that would surely entail……or get slapped upside the head hard enough with reality that I quit wanting this.     Neither seemed to be happening or even likely to happen at all…certainly not a recommendation for hrt, and I hadn’t quit wanting this…...all we seemed to be doing was wasting time.  Time I didn’t really have.   In between sessions I would listen to clips on you tube or podcasts while going about my daily tasks.     When I had used the term dysphoria, that revealed to my counselor I had been trying to do research on my own on the internet.  She became indignant and told me that I needed to quit trying to look things up on the internet, that doing so wasn’t going to help anything.   I decided I was tired of wasting my time visiting with her once a week.   My partner decided that was a sign I wasn’t even trying anymore.   Our home had taken on a sense of living death….one that hasn’t quite happened yet….but one everybody knows is inevitable…..but doesn’t really want to talk about.    That was what I was trying to avoid as I sat here in my truck not yet going home….that and all of the guilt and sorrow and self-hatred that came with it.  

It was getting harder and harder to turn that key over each night.   Everything seemed to so impossible….why was it that what my heart wanted more than anything else in the world…..had to be this?   Had to be something that so much of society considered morally and physically disgusting…an insult against the God who had created me…..A lie.   Everything about the society and culture I lived in told me that I should get over this nonsense and quit thinking about these things.    Everything about the society and culture I lived in told me I was an awful person for the fact I was thinking about these things.   Inwardly I knew…..I probably wouldn’t….I hadn’t managed to quit thinking about these kind of things in the thirty years I could remember…..it’s just, things had gotten so much worse since I had found out that I actually could do anything about it. 

I’d always lived those voices in the back of my head…..at least as long as I could remember….the ones that told me that I should just punch out and let that time card flutter to the floor….that the world really didn’t need me in it,  that the world would be better off without me in it,  that the people I cared about would be better off too….all I ever managed to do was drag them down……all I was capable of was making them as miserable as I was..   Those voices had been pretty loud the last several weeks, morphing from their normal good morning hello waiting to be drowned out by coffee into a constant cacophony that left me feeling so exhausted and defeated.   So far in life I had managed to weather their call out mostly out of duty….there was also was one more task that needed done first……I didn’t want to force somebody else to have to pick up the mess of unfinished tasks and projects I was responsible for…..didn’t want to force somebody I knew to have to clean up the mess of a successful suicide….didn’t want to force my parents to have to take care of me if I botched things and didn’t get the job done.    I wasn’t sure how many times I had heard that admonition that suicide was for those who were too selfish to care about all the pain they would leave for everybody else in their lives.   In some ways I knew that was true….I’d seen the way it left deep scars in families that lasted for generations,   known personally the way the suicide of one of the soldiers I had served with had left me with the sorrow of senseless waste and the guilt of wishing I had reached out, the guilt of thinking maybe, if I had been a better friend I would have known he was even struggling.   I didn’t want to leave that for my family…didn’t want to leave the trauma of having to find my body or have to identify it….I’d done enough hard things in life to know it was pretty hard to un-see bodies.   I didn’t want to do that to them.   The voices called out….”Do you really think any of that is worse than having a grown-a@@ kid who decides to become a tranny?”   There was a whole host of slurs that came with that one that seemed to be despised at a whole different level.   My family was fairly religious,  I wasn’t sure which was worse…..to have a kid who offed themselves because they were a failure versus spending the rest of their lives listening to the whole town talk about what a failure that kid was…..and how much they had failed as Christians in teaching said kid how to live  his life.  

   I didn’t know…..I was tired of this battle…tired of the same voices every night…tired of the same problems that never went away.     Tired of feeling dead inside…..that spark of hope that had come with finding out that being transgender was a thing some people survived had run smack dab into some fairly serious questions of whether I would.    I wasn’t so sure….I was already struggling….I’d always struggled…..what made me think I was strong enough to make that journey?   What made me think that journey would be worth the costs?   The alienation?  The scorn?   The choice to be something it seemed that so much of society completely despised?   By now I had given this idea of an alternate me a name…..Everything about the culture and society I lived told me I should kill her….to bury her so deep she could never came back….never threaten to ruin my life again.    Somehow that felt just as heavy as the idea of taking my own life……Maybe heavier.   I actually wanted to be her….I’m not sure I had ever wanted to be me.   

A few days later I blew out the candle on my birthday cake.   Forty years….without a whole lot to show for it….at least not a whole lot I was particularly proud of.   Someone wise cracked….”Make a wish.”   And for the first birthday in my life….I actually did.   I wished I could actually do this…..and then I pinched out the candle because it was one of those annoying ones that kept coming back to life and I didn’t really want to cover the top of the cake in spit.  

A week later I started hrt…there was a certain amount of fear and apprehension as I let the pills dissolve under my tongue….I was trying to DIY with grey market materials I was able to obtain without a prescription…definitely not a route I would recommend.  There were reasonable questions of whether the pills I had obtained actually had the levels of estradiol and progesterone claimed to be in them or whether there was anything else in them that might kill me or otherwise ruin my life.  It was a risk.  I wasn’t sure why I was okay with taking it.   Was I desperate?   Just reckless by nature?   I wasn’t sure, only that I hoped this path led in the direction I wanted to go.  

In truth it only sort of did, sublingual delivery would be an incredibly ineffective route for me….I would spend the first two years of my journey self-dosing at levels well below where they needed to before I finally started working with an endocrinologist.    Doing HRT has been so much effective since.  The decision to start HRT without being upfront about it with my partner or seeking her approval would be the final blow to our relationship,  one that destroyed what little grace or trust she was still willing to extend me.   Of all the regrets that have come with this path…that is one of the heaviest….Her rejection and departure would end up stinging far less than the knowledge that she deserved far more respect and truth than I gave her and that I truly do deserve her contempt….not for being trans, or for choosing to pursue transition, but for the ways I failed to live up to the basic tenets of relationships….honesty, communication, care and compassion.   That weight, and the weight of watching her heart break will be mine to carry for a long time……..a long, long time.  

Whether I survive this journey will always be  “still to be seen.”   Everything about life is uncertain, I have lived a life that has taught me far too well that tomorrow has never been promised….that each day that comes is a privilege and a blessing….an opportunity we make daily get to make a choice in how we spend.  That each time we make it to nightfall with the same number of friends and loved ones as we began the day with is a luxury….a luxury that somewhere, somebody won’t receive.   In truth, for me, those voices never went away…..but they have at least quieted down…..content to simply exchange morning greetings or poke their head in during rough patches.   Eventually I was able to get that counseling from the VA,  During one of those sessions I told my therapist that suicidal ideation and I were like old friends…neither of us really scared each other anymore… we might talk to each other fairly frequently but  both of us know I won’t actually do anything.   She didn’t seem to think that was nearly as humorous or as amusing as I did.   All the same, I’ve learned that so much of making it through…is simply hanging on….one day at a time....and if you can’t believe that things could ever get better for you….then you hang on to try to protect the people you care about…and when even that fails….for spite and stubbornness………..and believe it or not, sometimes it really does get better.  

For me, it would get better.  It took a while, it took some work, but somewhere along the way I learned that I could be a person worth liking …..even if I was trans.  That I could be kind and considerate, that I could still make people laugh, that I could hold my head high, that my-self-worth and relationships with other could be determined by my character and conduct and not just a label or whatever stereotypes people might have associated with that label.   There is so much in life I’m not particularly proud of, but there are also things to be proud of.   I will include in that small list, that I have managed to weather some of the storm I have, maybe not the fact those storms existed,  there was certainly room for improvement in the way I weathered most of them, some of them were of my own making….but for the fact that I’m still here, still trying to survive, still trying to learn and grow, still trying to learn how to become a better person, still hoping I can help make the world a better place, even if I’m not always sure what exactly that looks like.  Maybe some of that is just privilege or luck, but I’m starting to understand it is still a heck of a blessing.  And somewhere along the way,  sometimes you discover you’re still capable of having good days, even in the midst of all the pain.",28,1756744931.0,TransLater,5,0.94,False

Once again thank you to u/SpacePaladin15 for creating the space pangolins.

 

**Memory Transcription Subject: Makriv, Krev Adoption Program Participant.**

Date \[*standardized human time*\]: December 23, 2160

I found my seat in the upper rows of the classroom, the seats all around me filled with the other parents who had signed up for the adoption program. The room was filled with chatter, exclamations of uncertainty and doubts what was going to happen now.

The last class was suppose to have happened a few days ago, this one was called for to be an emergency meeting of all the participants that are in my group. I was anxious about what was going to be discussed, and I dreaded the possibility that the babies may not be coming here at all.

The news of the human’s home world not only surviving but being able to take on the Federation and win swept through the entirety of the Consortium. Avor alone was in an uproar with multiple millions of people signing up on the exchange program waiting list and thousands requesting passports. I read article after article speculating what was going to happen next, the general media was that of nervousness and anger.

Though I liked reading through the lighter ones exclaiming that the humans living was best thing has happened since Unification. That there will now be the adorable primates all over the galaxy instead of solely located in Consortium space.

The Jaslip enclaves are in an uproar, the Reskest and Krev governments trying to placate them. The humans here wanting to go home was not a big surprise, all they knew was that Earth was gone and suddenly it was back. It seemed that the Mayor was trying to convince some that we had a good place here and that they should stay, and it was working for the most part.

I couldn’t agree with that though, I wanted the cuties to stay, it was like a fantasy living here among them, but, it was their choice whether or not to leave. Right now, the whispers from the couple behind me were voicing the same concerns I had, but the biggest question I had was still waiting to be answered.

What was going to happen to the adoption program now that the necessity of growing their population wasn’t as important anymore. I set my bag on the floor next to my feet and settled in trying not to panic about what’s been happening around our entire society.

‘It’s like balancing on a knife’s edge over the unknown.’

Soon enough, Teddy appeared and walked up to the front of the room behind the desk placing a mug of some beverage on it. They turned around and even from where I was sitting there were dark areas under his eyes and he tried to force a smile through his fatigue. I grew concerned seeing what the news was doing to one of the humans.

“Thank you all for coming, I know that with everything going on that it’s a little bit chaotic outside and I apologise for that.” He said placing a small laptop he had stored in a carry case on the podium.

“If the schedule was happening properly then right now you would all be meeting at the hospital rather than here, but life is definitely an unknown despite how much we control it. Anyway, I wanted todays emergency session to be a way to clear the air, and clear up any lingering questions that any of you may still have, especially regarding the news recently.” He finished.

I watched as claws, wings, paws and voices went up across the room, we all had questions on what to do now. The humans being around meant that the program was no longer needed to resurrect the species, but the babies are already coming here. I knew that me and Axicy would be raising a little human, we knew what we signed up for and we wouldn’t be backing out of that now.

‘I just feared that the other parents wouldn’t have the same resolve.’

“Derlin, you can start and we’ll work our way across the room.” Teddy said pointing to the Krev in the front row.

“Hi, uh- when will the kids be getting here and a-are they safe? We know that the guards on the ship ended up in a fight and I just want to know if they are safe or not?” They asked with a flurry of nods and agreements among everyone here.

“That is an excellent question. From what we know, the Sapient Coalition forces where never fighting near the hull compartment holding the vats. The consensus was that the fighting never even made it to the rooms adjacent to the storage area, so it is a safe assume that the kids are alright. The commander of the ship would have told us immediately if there was any damage to that part of the ship.”

The relief was palpable, I was holding a breath waiting for the news that some of the kids hadn’t made it, but I was thankful that they were ok. A portion of the parents here lowered their arms, and I was glad that a good portion of them seemed like they wanted to stay on from what I could tell.

“I guess I’m next.” Another Krev said next to Derlin. “I wanted to know what’ll be happening now with the program and us as well. The humans are alive and well on Earth from what I know of, would the Sapient Coalition want the children to reside in their territory and if so, would we have to move to look after them?” They asked with a murmur of agreement among some of the others here.

“Another good question, we’ve been told that the children and program will not be uprooted, it as a matter for the United Nations to discuss since it was human children. The infrastructure and program participants have already been located here, the program will be staying here. I must add that Tellus is going to be registered as a UN colony and thus the children will be UN citizens in a sense, if all the information I have is correct.” He added at the end.

“Um, do you know when the children will arrive?” A Resket this time spoke up, they were in the same row with me, I saw a few of the Krev in the front row turn to look at the pink avian and agree with the question.

“I was hoping to leave it to the end to tell all of you, but with the ship being delayed, the babies won’t be born until the twenty-fifth of this month. I have already sent information regarding the hospitals you will need to go to. Next question?”

He was right, about a month ago we had received an information packet about where we would need to go, the documentation about ourselves we would need and so on. I couldn’t believe it still, that fact that we were only two days away from seeing our little one, it reminded me on when Lerim was borne, I was so nervous then and it still hasn’t changed. I was nervous.

“About the classes so far, are the recordings still available for download even after the classes are done?” A Trombil I recognised spoke up, their partner nodding along next to them.

“The videos and information about the classes will still be available, as long as you have your login credentials it will remain on the system indefinitely.” Teddy answered after turning around and picking up his mug and taking a drink of it.

I let myself daydream a little since the questions I had were mostly answered. I went over the names we had chosen for the little one and from the selection me and Axicy with the help from Lerim had narrowed it down to two each, though I guess Toddlly was a good runner up if Lerim had his way. We wanted to choose a human name for them, even though humanity is still around, it was still better to have them raised on their culture.

‘That and I liked the human’s names for people.’

I imagined what the little human baby would look like in Axicy’s and my own arms, and I cooed in delight from the picture I had. I was either a bag of nerves or overly excited about them. I couldn’t wait to meet them, and I don’t think I’d be able to sleep at all until they were here.

“If there are any questions about any of the subjects we covered now would be the time to ask them.”  I asked the class.

I didn’t really have anything that needed to be asked.

“I know it’s not something that was covered in the curriculum, but I would like to ask regardless, but what about second names and stuff. I know that you humans have an additional name, I just wanted to know.” A Jaslip asked the question.

‘Maybe I do have a question.’

Teddy’s face blanked for a moment before realising something and raised a hand to scratch the back of his head while he came up with some kind of answer.

“That’s uh, actually an oversight by us. We do have surnames like my own ‘Knight’ but I know that many of the Consortium members we have spoken to about it had none and many didn’t see the point in having a surname considering the amount of information used to identify the individual.” He turned and took another drink of his coffee if I was guessing correctly.

“I personally believe that it is up to you guys to choose whether or not to have a surname for the child, however I personally believe that the name should be adopted by the entire family to make sure that the kid doesn’t feel ostracized. I’ll be sure to send out a few more information packets with the types of surnames and what they mean. Thank you for bringing that up it sort of slipped my mind the past few days.”

I’ll need to go through the information with Axicy and see what she thinks. I grabbed my pad out my satchel and sent a quick text to her to see if she had some names that could work.

“What sort of surnames would be alright for humans?” I raised a hand and asked after placing my pad back in my bag.

“A last name would be something to describe or differentiate the individual, it could be something as simple as a colour or maybe the persons occupation or livelihood. Though it could just be another name for example, lets say a guy named Jack would have his first name, his second name could be something like Flanders, hence the name Jack Flanders or maybe Tom Holander. The name could be whatever you want it to be, but I wouldn’t make it something stupid, it is a big decision and I have to apologise for my carelessness in doing this sooner.”

It left me thinking, he said that it could also be down to one’s livelihood meaning position as well, though I don’t like the thought of Makriv Aata Analytic. It just seemed a little bit crass, I would need to go over the options with Axicy when I get home, it’s a decision that the both of us need to make and figure out together.

“What would you do if someone else already has that same last name?” One of the Tromblis asked this time.

“Then they would have the same last name, it’s happened before where two totally separate people have the same last name, and first name believe it or not. I think there was two girls here with the same name, same former job and they met wearing the same clothes. It just happens sometimes when universe matches like that.”

“But then how do you tell the difference between the two of them if they look somewhat similar?”

“It can easily be done by a simple method of where they live, documentation and even fingerprints if it’s necessary.”

“Fingerprints?” A Krev sitting in the front row asked this time.

“We have small indentations and lines on our fingers, I’m sure you’ve seen them before, they are all unique to that person due to the way they formed.”

That’s what those were for, I always thought the lines where just some part of them that didn’t matter, I didn’t know that they could identify the individual. I should have asked more about it when I had the chance to.

“Anyway, we got a bit of topic here for a bit, is there anything relating to the topics we covered that anyone has a problem with or is unclear about?”

The room went silent again after Teddy got the class in order again, I noticed one of the Krev in front raise a claw to ask a question, hesitating as they did so.

“What about pets?” One of the Jaslips asked this time raising a paw to get the Teddy’s attention.

“Good question, if you have pets, it would be best to keep them away from the child for a short time at the start, if they can be trusted and I mean **trusted**, then observe the pet and how they interact with the child. Always have them under supervision and never leave the kid alone with them, remember they are still animals. For Obors on the other hand, I would not trust them around a child at all, they would either recognise it as one of their own kind or view them as a threat in their territory.” He explained with a seriousness I had not seen him display yet.

“What if they are older, the child I mean?” The Jaslip continued a little more nervous than last time.

“Then maybe but I would still show extreme caution when handling them and having them around a toddler or small child it is a risk until the baby is old enough to handle a Obor themselves.” The Jaslip was satisfied by the answer and lower their paw.

“Um, I know that the babies will cry and all, but from what I can tell by the humans I’ve met, human babies cry a lot more than any other species. I just wanted to know if it’s true?” A Krev asked this time wanting to confirm what I had already.

“That would be correct, human babies will cry, and they will cry a lot. I know that you all have the information on it and that some believe that the babies wouldn’t cry that much, but I cannot stress enough that babies will cry. They will cry about their food, they will cry when they can’t sleep, they will cry because they slept too much. Sometimes they will cry because of the time of day, it’s down to the baby itself but I grantee that they will cry.”

My mind flashed back to what Jessica said at the festival about the babies crying all the time. I knew what we were getting into, Axicy as well, we went over the human’s media multiple times to gather as much information as possible and we came to the conclusion that the baby will cry a lot. I was prepared for it but part of me hoped that we could get one that wouldn’t be like some of the nightmare stories we read online.

Though it was extremely cute reading how much the baby loved the parent, when they left for a minute into another room, the baby would start balling they’re adorable little eyes out. Though, I don’t think much would keep me away from the little munchkin that we’ll be raising, or Axicy for that matter.

From the sound soft it though, it could be taxing but I’m sure it’ll be fine with both myself and Axicy looking after them it’ll be great finally having them around, tickling their little hands and bopping them on the nose. I lost myself in my imagination again, about the future of going out for walks or putting them to sleep that I almost didn’t catch the last few things Teddy was saying.

“With everything going on right now, I don’t think I’ll be able to visit everyone in the hospital, however working between me and my colleague we should be able to do it. We’ll visit to see how things are going to be progressing and checking on the child’s health. I’m sure that if there is an emergency regarding the child you won’t hesitate to take them to a hospital and call me.”

There were murmurs of agreement among everyone gathered it seemed that everyone here would be continuing the program from what I could tell. With that though the emergency class ended rather fast, but then again it was just for asking about anything we were unsure about.

As I started packing up my things I went through a mental checklist of things that we have and thought if we were missing anything.

‘Nappies, baby formula, baby clothes, a few toys, and about a dozen sets of dummies. I don’t know why Axicy bought that many, but Jessica said that they get lost very easily. Baby bottles, pram, crib, and basically everything we sort of needed long term as well.’

I finished packing and made my way out while I was thinking but was stopped at the door when Teddy started filing out the same way and struck up a conversation.

“You, ok?” Turning to look at me when we were in the foyer as the others filed past us.

I could hear a few of them talking and being excited about the prospect of finally being able to see their new kids. Oddly enough it was the Reskets who were the most vocal about their excitement at seeing them grow up.  While my kind were chatting about how cute the little ones were going to be.

“Uh, yeah. I was just thinking.” I said back being slightly caught off guard.

“Mind if I ask what about?” He prodded further.

“Just making sure we had everything we need, just a checklist really and seeing if we needed anything else.” I explained and Teddy nodded along.

“That’s prudent of you, I’ve seen your wife in here as well a few times. You guys never missed a single lesson, I’m sure you’ll have everything covered. If you need anything just give me a call.” He spoke.

“Um- how would we choose the surname?” I blurted out before he was able to turn away, he gave me a look that was adorable and insisted that I continued. “It’s just, I don’t know where we would even start to look for one.” I explained a bit better, Teddy stayed quiet for a moment thinking of something to say before replying.

“A last name is important yes, but you shouldn’t stress about it, you can have a last name of someone important to yourself or have some sort of fancy surname. Most people don’t get to choose what their surname is, with the initiative you’ve shown me, I’m sure that you would come up with a good one.” He explained matter of flatly as if we were still sitting in the classroom.

“Thank you, its just. I don’t want to choose something stupid.”

“Don’t be like that, you’ll be fine. I would discus it with your wife and see how you both feel about it. Just asking but have either of you decided on a first name?”

“We have, right now we were going to go with either Luke or Micheal if it’s a boy or Jessica and Elizabeth if it’s a girl.” I said having narrowed it down even further after Axicy wanted to make sure we had a name ready for when we went to pick them up.

‘Now we have to choose a surname for all of us in a fraction of the time.’

“Those names are lovely, I know a Micheal from when we were underground still. Since you have those chosen, I’m sure a surname will come to you soon.” A Krev from the lesson approached and caught Teddy’s attention. “I have to go, I’ll either see you at the hospital or maybe a house visits in the future, keep yourself safe.” He said before starting a conversation with another one of the prospective parents.

He said that you could use a name of someone important to you or something else. I think I have an idea about what name I could use, but I would need to ask Axicy before deciding.

No regrets though: the coffee itself is excellent. The beans are high quality, the roast is spot on, and everything feels really well thought out. It’s one of those roasters that manages to nail both the **look** and the **taste**.

1n5tlfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreastCancerSurvivors/comments/1n5tlfc/booknavigating_menopause_after_cancer/,Book-Navigating Menopause after Cancer,"
I bought this book like almost everyone did based hoping to review the chart on the inside that was alluded too many times in her podcast with experts to help break down per your specific cancer type what your risk might be if you took HRT. I thought this chart would be more specific about various types of breast cancer, but it's not- it's got every type of cancer possible in it and has no specifics about breast cancer such as how many years out you are or how you were treated or anything specific like that. Just so you know, if you have any sort of hormone positive cancer it just says ""avoid""- this is talking out both sides of her face because she constantly interviews people who have triple positive cancers and estrogen and progesterone positive cancers who take HRT!!-so to put a chart out like this makes no sense at all. But I guess when you're trying to make all the money you can, you don't wanna shut anyone out of purchasing.  I even listened to the interview of the guy who was behind the chart and they alluded to the fact that people with estrogen positive and progesterone positive breast cancers could take HRT but then they printed their chart with nothing more than AVOID listed- what the hell is going on here I'm really sick of this. The author states that osteoporosis is the silent killer in the book, but then failed to mention that the number one means of combating this is taking estradiol. It is better than anything else, but yet you choose not to say this. Go to Peter Attia if you want some real analysis of those ridiculous trials that have ruined our lives. this book is better for people who don't have a clue. I dont need a chapter devoted to how to journal about your experience and whether Coffee is safe or not. Where is the real analysis where are the real explicit detailed facts about different types of HR+ breast cancer and how possibly HRT could affect it. Seems like the research shows that you're more likely to have a recurrence if you drink more than seven drinks a week than if you take us very low dose HRT patch   if oncologist are still saying no to this, Where are they? Why are they not speaking out to say why in detail? Looking for more information. ",1,1756744627.0,BreastCancerSurvivors,1,1.0,False

It is been seven months now and my life has never been the same ever since this day. I get migraine attacks almost daily and this always leaves me So drained that I can't do anything productive. I have been on medications for almost four months now and I can't see any improvement. I read a lot about triggers and how important it is to avoid them . But I can't know what triggers mine. I stopped drinking coffee ,cut off sugar and salt from my diet , avoided being in crowdy and noisy places , regulate my sleep , everything that I have read here about possible triggers ,I have tried to avoid it yet I still get them daily . I don't know what to do . I am newly wed and this happened to  me during my honey moon . It had such a bad impact on my marriage. I don't know if it is caused by stress or it is the reason for the stress that I feel now .What scares me is that I have no control over stress. I am this type of person that if there is no reason for stress I would invent . I have also tried everything with this but this stress problem but this  is just me .I don't have the means to go to physicartic to seek help . Not that I have not  tried this before , I did but where I live it is very very hard to find a good and trustful physicartic. My experience with this was very bad and it didn't do me any good and I can't take any medicine to help cut down my stress without doctor prescription. My question is what if I can't control my stress, would I always be like this . I will always be this sick . I have tried mediation and many other things like journaling praying reading . Nothing works with me. If stress is triggering my migraine what to do when it is even more chronic than the headache itself . ",3,1756744561.0,VestibularMigraines,6,1.0,False

1n5tiu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/prediabetes/comments/1n5tiu1/a1c_journey_from_63_56_1_year_and_ongoing/,A1C Journey: From 6.3 → 5.6 (1 Year and Ongoing),"  \*\* Writing this below so that it can help someone with their Pre-diabetic journey. I think the key is to give it some time and do a step by step evaluation as what works versus what doesn’t.

**Background**

* Post-COVID, fasting glucose started crossing **>100**.
* My doctor prescribed A1C test

A1C test results over time every year.

Year 1: **5.7 → 5.9 → 6.1 → 6.3**

* Initially ignored due to no family history of diabetes.
* At **6.3**, realized it was only **0.1 away from full diabetes** and decided to take action.

**Step 1: Initial Monitoring & Small Changes**

* Bought **AUVON Blood Glucose Monitor Kit** (pre-CGM era).
* Fasting glucose consistently **124–134**.
* Identified dietary habits:
   * Morning: coffee with milk + sugar
   * Lunch: rice with curry
   * Evening: snacks (chips/rice crackers)
   * Dinner: rice with curry

**Action Taken**

* Cut out **milk & sugar** from coffee.
* Kept lunch the same.
* Adjusted dinner:
   * Eat before **6:30–7:30 PM**
   * Only liquids after dinner (e.g., tea)

**Result**: Fasting glucose dropped from **130 → 110**.

**Step 2: Portion Control & Exercise**

* Reduced **rice portion by 50%**.
* Added treadmill walks: **45 mins at 4.2 on treadmill**.
* Difficult initially, but got easier with time.

**Result**: Fasting Glucose levels consistently **<100** and experienced weight loss.

**Observations & Symptoms**

* After lunch: fatigue, need for naps, sinus tightening, blurry vision.
* Reading glasses power kept increasing.
* Initially thought age-related, but later connected to blood sugar fluctuations.

**Step 3: Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)**

* Started using **Stello CGM (OTC)**.
* Learned how food impacted glucose and refined lifestyle rules.

**Rules That Worked**

1. **Breakfast**
   * Coffee (no sugar) + 2 eggs **or** yogurt with berries & chia seeds. Followed this religiously. Again if I had to eat carb I had to pay a “carb fee”. Walking 10-15 mins within 30 mins.
   * Avoid breads, muffins, pancakes.
   *  
2. **Lunch**
   * Order: 1 cup salad → half-portion curry + rice (brown rice preferred).
   * On high-carb occasions (eating out): walk **20–30 mins** afterward (“carb fee”).
3. **Snacks (3–4 PM)**
   * Cheese, boiled peanuts, or soya chunks.
   * Prepped in advance (weekend prep helpful).
4. **Dinner (before 7:30 PM)**
   * No rice/carbs.
   * Only proteins + veggies (curry, soups, large veggie portions).
   * Treadmill: 45 mins, 3–4 times a week, speed 4.2 (goal: sweat).this is after dinner  (“carb fee”). Improves sleep quality.
5. **Supplements**
   * **Berberine**: morning + evening.
   * Took 1–3 months to show results, but helped stabilize glucose.

**Results**

* **A1C**: 6.3 → **5.6**
* **Weight**: 165 lbs → **150 lbs**
* **Vision**: No increase in glasses prescription.
* **Symptoms**: Fatigue, sinus, and blurry vision **gone**.

**Key Takeaways**

1. **Portion control**
2. **Carbohydrate management**
3. **Meal timing**
4. **Regular exercise**

**Future Challenges**

* Reducing reliance on **Berberine**.
* Reducing dependency on **CGM** (goal: maintain discipline without it).
* Maintaining long-term consistency in lifestyle habits.

I'm into movies, long walks, and I’ll never say no to a spontaneous night of bowling even if my skills are questionable 😅

I’m hoping to connect with a Punjabi girl, someone kind, easygoing, and fun, who enjoys the little things in life. Culture and shared values matter to me, and I’d love to meet someone who feels the same.

Whether it turns into something serious or just a meaningful connection, I’m open-minded and drama-free.

I suggested going for a coffee and a walk so it's easy to chat and get to know each other and he agreed. Fast-forward to today, we reaffirmed we were both happy to meet and go on said walk and the way we were talking about it put me under the impression that the walk was essentially part 1 of the date, then we'd head elsewhere (looking back it's possible I got the wrong end of the stick though? Not sure).

But um... that's not what happened. We met and went for a walk for literally 15 minutes chatting before he wanted to head back (so the walk was 30 mins total). I was a bit confused and asked him if we wanted to go do something else or end the date there and he essentially said no to doing something else in a longwinded way.

Now I'm not delusional, a guy wanting to cut things that short normally means he isn't interested but during said walk he was very like... romantic, wanting to hold hands, hug and seemed super interested in me in general, constantly complimenting me. He even asked about my birthday and insisted we put our birthdays down in eachothers phone calendars? But then on the negative side again, on the way back I double checked if he was sure he didn't want to go and do something else today and he gave some excuses about needing to head back again.

To add an extra layer of confusion, the date ended with him kissing me (I didn't initiate) and he seemed to genuinely want to take me out on a second date for a coffee or movie and made some jokes saying things like ""as long as you don't unmatch me that is"".

My head is just spinning because of all the mixed signals, like I've literally gotten back home within an hour of leaving??? I wasted so much time getting ready for no reason and barely got to know him. Did we just get some wires crossed and this was a perfectly normal first date or was he actually not interested and all those other things were just him putting on a show?

I have messaged him to tell me when he's home so we can talk about how things went but I've made this post in the meantime as my minds racing.

Positive update: Apparently he did just have things to do (still not 100% sure why he would agree to a date if he had to rush off so quickly but hey) and has showered me with tons of compliments over message + he has asked me out again later this week. Obviously I'm going to have to make sure the dates a little longer this time though haha.",3,1756744143.0,dating,13,0.72,False
1n5tdjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/GPTAppsEngine/comments/1n5tdjw/unleashing_tech_magic_nocode_automation_is/,🪄 Unleashing Tech Magic: No-Code Automation Is Empowering Millions To Become Digital Sorcerers—Are You Ready To Join The Revolution?,"🚀✨ ""No Code Automation"" — The Most Exciting Tech Revolution You’re Probably Underestimating! ✨🚀

I still remember the first time I saw an automation run that I’d built—WITHOUT touching a single line of code. Seriously, it felt like magic.

Fast forward to today, and “no code” automation tools are absolutely everywhere. We’re living in a world where:

- Someone in HR can build an expense approval workflow before lunchtime.
- Marketers schedule, launch, and analyze campaigns while their coffee brews.
- Creatives finally say goodbye to copy-pasting data between ten different apps.  
   
And you know what? Every single time, it looks a little like technological wizardry. 🧙‍♂️

**But let’s break it down: Why is “no code automation” getting so much buzz?**

- **Democratization of tech:** You *don’t* need to be a developer to solve real problems now. The barriers are shattering.
- **Rapid prototyping:** Want to test an idea? Link up a form, a sheet, and a notification bot in minutes.
- **Endless integration:** Zapier, Make (formerly Integromat), IFTTT… They’re turning every digital tool into a Lego brick you can snap together—with crazy results!

Here’s the part that’s making me genuinely excited: “No code” is not just about time savings. It’s about *empowering* people to dream up creative solutions and actually bring them to life—without waiting weeks for IT or bugging the dev team for the hundredth time.

A few radical examples:

- Teachers automate grading so they can spend more moments with students—not spreadsheets.
- Indie founders wire up payment flows, CRM integrations, and feedback loops all by themselves.
- Nonprofits trigger tailored thank-you emails, donor dashboards, and reminders for volunteers, all with just a few clicks!
   
Imagine teenagers building micro-businesses from their phone. Or grandparents setting up their own home smart automations. That’s not just possible—it’s *happening*.

**But is it all sunshine and rainbows?**

Let’s be real: no code tools have their limits.

- For complex or highly specialized use cases, sometimes you really, really *do* need a dev.
- Handoffs and scalability can be tricky.
- If you automate something that’s not quite right, you could accidentally scale a mistake.

Still, we shouldn’t underestimate the *massive* shift these platforms represent.

The big, happy conclusion? “No code” is letting more people sculpt technology to their lives than ever before. And that’s something to be genuinely thrilled about! 🌟

What are YOUR favorite no-code automation wins? Have you pushed the limits (or run into them)? Drop your wildest success—or most comedic failure—below! I can’t wait to get inspired and maybe laugh a little. 😄⬇️",1,1756744140.0,GPTAppsEngine,0,1.0,False
1n5tb14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1n5tb14/dating_someone_new_after_being_cheated_on/,Dating someone new after being cheated on?,"I (20F) started dating someone (26M), we met on a dating app.

We started talking about two months ago. At first I didn't take it seriously because of the age difference thinking he may only want sex or just chatting and never meeting. We talked like once or twice a day about random stuff like what we were doing, games, movies, etc. We had an small discussion after three weeks of talking and he told me that he was a bit scared of me just wanting sex or something casual since I'm young and he has never dated with that big of an age difference, but we talked things and we both wanted a relationship. We went to our first date about a week after.

Honestly it's all been amazing up to now, we had a couple of coffee dates, watching movies at his house, and I stayed over one night so he made dinner and we watched movies. 

The problem is that I'm insecure because I've been cheated in past relationships. Since we already had sex I asked him if he's seeing anyone else because I wouldn't feel comfortable with that (mostly I'm scared of STDs), he told me no and asked me if I was seeing anyone and I also told him no. 
The only stuff that's giving me a bit of anxiety about this is that while I was on Instagram on my recommend accounts list there was a profile of a girl with only fans and he followed it, I try not to think much about it because looking at the profile he hasn't liked any of her photos after our first date, and other stuff that I've talked with him is that I found a bit odd that he never posted pics of us on stories.

I didn't talk about the other girl since he hasn't liked any post after we started dating, but I did talk about posting pics of us and he told me he wants to present me to his friends and meet mine first and have a couple more dates for us. He also told me that he isn't seeing or talking with anyone else since he wants a serious relationship with me, but that he understands my insecurities (I told him before about how I've been cheated). 

I'm thinking about going back to therapy next month if my anxiety gets worse (out of this little problem, I'm kinda burned out because of college and work). I don't want to be the type of toxic girlfriend that doesn't trust anything. He's been kind with all of this and told me we can talk about anything that bothers us, since he's the one that starts the talks most of the time (asks every date how am I feeling about us, if I feel he should do something different/better, etc and I ask the same. I think we both feel safe with this little check ups)
