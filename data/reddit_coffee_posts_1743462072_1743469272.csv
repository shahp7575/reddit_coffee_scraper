I'm looking for some romance readers to read and provide feedback on my book. It's a forced proximity STE(M) college romance with open-door scenes. I'm willing to swap but would prefer swapping with those with a romance MS!

Description: Aspiring cardiologist Amelie “Ellie” Liu has spent two years of college avoiding her biggest fear—understanding the human heart. After her mother’s sudden cardiac death, she’s been excelling in every pre-med course except the one that will help her save others from her mother’s fate. With her father’s ultimatum—get into St. Helena Medical School or move back to Shanghai—Ellie must ace anatomy this year and secure a letter of recommendation from her notoriously difficult professor. On top of that, Ellie’s best friend drops out before the start of junior year, leaving her in a house with an empty bedroom and two girls who blame her. Enter Stefan Song, the college town’s notorious ex-soccer star who mysteriously quit the team. After losing his scholarship and housing, he’s desperate for somewhere to stay before moving back home to finish college. But Stefan is nothing like his reckless reputation. He’s charming, secretly brilliant, and the one person who helps Ellie see the heart as more than a failing organ. As study sessions transform into morning coffees, messy parties, and midnight heart-to-hearts, Ellie realizes that love, like anatomy, isn’t an easy concept to grasp. With their time in St. Helena running out, Ellie must decide if she’ll keep running from her heart’s failures, or finally trust it to beat for something more.

I am also unmarried, never married, but have had long term relationships and I said sure. Let's connect us. I was excited - he seemed attractive and sounded mature and self aware (I am in my 30s and he's in his 40s). She quickly links us up, calls me up (so sweet) and shares his number with me.

When we connected he was very pleasant and polite and because we were on text he offered to call me any time. I, unfortunately, was a busy bee and could only text. While he certainly responded in a very timely manner, he took absolutely 0 initiative to actively send text messages to me. We had to wait nearly 2 days to talk over the phone. We finally spoke and it was a good conversation, and he was still very nice, but I found out he's actively, legally, married. He said they do not live together, but what gives? I did not agree to spend time with a married man. Plus, he has not reached out and it has been 24 hours. I am seeing now that he wants me to do 100% of the communication and he wants to lay back and respond.

I assumed she didn't know. So, when I saw her again, I didn't ask her to step out, but I did say ""I wanted to share the gentleman is married."" At first she was confused but I mentioned his name (and I realize I was inside still, *so coworkers likely heard it, albeit quietly*...anyway, I just wanted to inform her, but she surprised me and said ""but they don't live together"" and ""he's no longer married"" so it sounds like she was genuinely confused on the matter. I just said I would prefer a simpler type of dynamic, because I am unmarried, no legal issues or loose ends to deal with, and would like the same thing from the other side.

She was not at all rude but she gave me a look. It was not a pleasant look. Not a terrible look either, but not pleasant. Was I out of line? This is my boundary. Should I have asked her to step outside? Next time I will. But this was not a long or drawn out or loud conversation. She was more like, ""Hi! By the way, that guy is married. Oh, which one? Robert. Ah - but he isn't married any more. He is - he's actively legally married. But he doesn't live with her, right? Right, but I prefer something more simple. \*gives me a look\*""

Then she immediately switches gears and asks me to order because I was also going to buy something, so she just goes to that and does not mention the guy again. I don't know what to think. My abandonment and people pleasing fears are being triggered and I don't know how to handle it. I can't change that I didn't step outside but the guy wasn't even around and honestly, I didn't say anything bad.

When we spoke initially, the very first convo, she mentioned one other guy she wanted me to consider and I know for a fact he's unmarried. But now she might never speak to me again.

1joj9b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1joj9b8/aio_for_thinking_hospitality_bosses_are/,AIO for thinking hospitality bosses are gaslighting me?,"A few months ago I was hired for a job advertised as barista - a role I’m confident in and have been doing for twelve years. Throughout my meager one hour trial as barista which was during the busiest period of the day (meaning no organisation to train me) they decided to trial me on the floor because that’s where they needed help the most. I personally think it takes more than one hour to familiarise yourself with a new machine, new beans, new systems etc. 

Even though my resume highlights that majority of my hospo career has been with coffee, they continued to criticise me on the floor instead of training me. 

These red flags had presented themselves early but I was in a position where I really needed the job. I was hired during the Christmas period, arguably the busiest time of the year. I was instantly put on 40 hours per week on bar shifts (serving people and making drinks) while promising that eventually I’d be on coffee. I felt patronised when they said ""Don’t worry, if you can handle bar, you can handle anything!"" 

After a few months, more staff were hired, new staff were trusted with the coffee machine before myself, I’ve had a small handful of shifts on the machine but not enough to get me in the flow of their system. The bar is very social, and being a barista is where I shine because I can talk but also focus and get my introverted time. Because of the social burn out I asked if I could drop from 40 hours to 35, simply dropping a half day. I was told this was fine, yet over the next three weeks my shifts dropped from 40 hours, to 25, now to 15. 

Long story short, there was a misunderstanding on their end. I had to ask about the dropping of hours, they didn’t even bother to warn me my hours were rapidly dropping. I have the conversation about my request to drop a few hours, not a few days, in writing. I am thirty years old and have rent to pay, I found the lack of warning really inconsiderate and has never happened to me in a hospitality job before. They didn’t apologise for their misunderstanding of my request either. 

Recently, they sent out a message on a Friday evening for a mandatory staff meeting on Monday - two days time. This is technically not even one business day notice. As is my legal right, I don’t constantly check my work related messages outside of my hours. As I didn’t see the message about the staff meeting, it turns out I had to tell them I wasn’t available. Please keep in mind there is a constant stream of staff changes and messages, so it was very easy for me to miss the message because they send so many. This turned into a ""that’s not good enough"" scolding and an expectation that I make them a priority. I was very triggered at this point, how can they expect me to make them priority when they don’t value my work or prioritise me in return? 

After this, I was pulled into the office and made to feel like the unreasonable one. At this stage I was in complete disassociation mode, nodding, agreeing, swallowing my pride and apologising for whatever they made me feel like I did wrong. They said that they need to prioritise their more available staff (majority are uni students who can only work on weekends) yet somehow I’m not ""available enough"" even though I have offered myself for the opening to close shifts for four full weekdays (6:30am-5pm). 

I have heard other staff members get a bit short or blunt when we are very stressed and busy because it is a very chaotically run business. Yet, I am the only one who has been singled out. The cherry on top was being scolded for not being able to make the staff meeting, then hearing that others weren’t coming either. They ended up cancelling the staff meeting one hour out of the assigned time, yet made me feel like I was in the wrong for not having enough notice about the meeting. They haven’t held any accountability for their lack of communication and hiring me under false pretences. I feel like they used me for the busy period when they had no staff and now I am cast aside. They said it would take me ""years to be on coffee"" which really wrecked me because I know I can make a good cup of coffee, I’ve been told numerous times before and have had nothing but praise from previous employees and customer bases.

All the while I cry on the inside
Always afraid that my mask will slip 
That one day someone will see the truth within

That I wake in the morning with feelings of dread
But I always roll over and put a smile on instead
Never letting the mask slip even when alone
Afraid I wont put it back on when I leave this home

Then one day things started to change
As I sat in a coffee shop and a pretty girl walked my way
She looked so happy and free
And for the first time in my life, I felt that someone saw me

Not the me that I show to the world
but the me that I keep inside hidden and curled
One look into her eyes and it was clear to see
That for once in my life someone saw the true me

My mask had fallen and fear rose inside
But that beautiful voice quelled the storms and the tides
She took my hand and looked deep in my eyes
Saying “It’s okay. You don’t have to hide.”

1joj8ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1joj8ac/i_dont_believe_in_ghosts_but_sometimes_im_tempted/,"I don't believe in ghosts, but sometimes I'm tempted","Be warned, this is a true story, recounted in the best detail I can remember, so it is long. Forgive me for being vague/changing a few names and indirectly related details here and there to obscure identities.

Between the ages of 16 and 20 I dated a girl that actually lived in her local haunted house. It was a large flagstone farmhouse in a hamlet in the north east of England- for hamlet imagine 12 houses and a pub on a hillside. It was only about 10 minutes walk along a country road from the next village- a larger settlement that was originally built to accommodate local miners around the turn of the 20th century. 

Her house was at the top of the hill, and was the oldest building in the area by at least 100 years. To give some idea of the size of the house; after the farm had stopped working and was sold (early 1900s) the house had been partitioned into two homes to provide accomodation for miners. Later,  after the mining company sold out and the miners were leaving, her parents had bought the two houses with the idea of renovating them and turning them back into a single, very large, house. Now, her parents weren't wealthy, and so the work on the house had been ongoing for over 10 years, mostly DIY, by the time I started dating her.

The place was huge, with high ceilings, outbuildings in the yard, rooms in various states of completion, and the whole property was surrounded by old trees. The interior had a strange layout due to the reversed partition; there was one large old staircase on one end of the house, and a newer staircase on the opposite end (built when the building was split). Downstairs were four large rooms, one had been kept as a kitchen with original fireplace, the other three were in the process of being converted into living and dining rooms. Upstairs were six bedrooms and two bathrooms, along one long corridor, with a hatch at each end leading to a huge attic space that spanned the house. The attic was the subject of local rumour.

Her friends from the nearby village would frequently joke about her house being haunted, and would recount various stories about a family who were terrorised by their abusive father, with rumours of suicide or possible murder taking place in the attic on one end of the building. There were also stories of the land itself being haunted due to accidents which had occured in the mine tunnels beneath the hill. If you're familiar with the old northern mining towns, you'll know that stories of ""pit disasters"" are common- there are even entire towns ostensibly named after such incidents (see Burnhope and Pity Me). 

My girlfriend seemed to be quite proud of the fact that living there gave her a reputation for bravery, a haunted house on haunted land was quite a boast, although she often admitted to being scared at times. She'd told stories of seeing and hearing things in the house that made her feel significantly less brave. She had heard footsteps in the attic, and when he lived at home her older brother claimed to have seen the shadow of a person outside of his bedroom door, directly below the attic hatch. Her father had also said that early on in the renovation he had removed ""bothering murals"" which were painted on upstairs walls on one side of the house, although he refused to describe their content. It was always hard to know if these stories were exaggerated for the sake of local gossip, but naturally I ate them up with a spoon. 

One of the best things about the house, from our teenage POV, was the fact it was often empty. My GFs brother was living away, studying at university. Her parents were both involved in coaching athletics at a reasonably high level, meaning they would frequently travel to competitions. This gave me a great opportunity to stay over for several days at a time, which I usually did. In general, I found the house creepy, but never heard or saw anything too terrifying. Other than the occasional creek or bump, which could easily be attributed to aging architecture, I felt reasonably safe there for a while.

As you can imagine the ghost stories fascinated us all as teenagers, and so one weekend when we were about 18 we invited some friends to stay over with us for a ""ghost party"". Generally we were wary of having parties, since areas of the house were unfinished, and we really didn't want to piss of my GFs parents and lose our sweet love pad, but we figured that a small one wouldn't hurt (especially now that we were Oh So Mature!). We invited six people over and spent the early evening exploring the outbuildings and attic, telling and listening to spooky stories about the house and the area. My favourite tale was that if the crying babies- it was said that if you listened carefully at just the right time, on just the right day each year, you could hear the distant sound of babies crying. A spectral memorial to the exact moment a mine tunnels collapsed decades before, killing several miners and triggering tremors that disturbed the local infants. 

After tiring of ghost stories and fruitless ghost hunting, we ordered pizza, had a couple of drinks each, and by about 1am we retreated to the most renovated living room to watch TV and drink more. This is when things got scary. 

One of the girls (we'll call her Sophie) was getting quite highly strung about the normal creeking and spookiness of the house, and requested that someone come upstairs with her and stand guard in the corridor while she went to pee. She left the room with 'mat', who clearly had a crush on her, and we all laughed as we heard their footsteps above us- obviously walking past the bathroom and further along the bedroom corridor... Then the door to our living room burst open like it had been kicked in, and both of them rushed in looking whiter than your white grandma trying to 'do a raps'. Mat blurted that they had seen a shadow at the top of the stairs, and they hadn't gotten more than halfway up. He insisted it was one of us ""bastards"" that had snuck up the other staircase to scare them, but even he didn't seem to believe it. We said that we heard footsteps along the corridor, but we hadn't left the room. Surely it was Mat that was trying to scare US! The fact is, we were all scared and none of us quite knew what to believe. 

We decided to all go up and look around, and so we did, like some kind of disparate group of teens disgorged from a green minivan to hunt old men disguised as ghosts, we crept upstairs. Somehow I think we felt that if we were quiet, we wouldn't anger the ghost. I can be flippant now, but at the time we were all running on 90% adrenaline and 10% alcohol. The tension was palpable, and every creek of the house or sigh of wind at the window had us freezing in place and staring desperately into shadows in the hope of seeing nothing staring back at us. Nothing in my life has felt so dangerous as the seconds we spent sneaking under the attic hatch, hoping it stayed shut. 

After a few minutes we had swept the bedrooms and bathroom at one end of the house, and the tension was calming. Naturally, we lads began to talk about how we definitely weren't scared, and definitely wanted to catch the ghost. Although this was the opposite of true in my case, it did seem to relax everyone, and a few of us went to check the other bedrooms. I knew that we were heading into the end of the house where my GFs older brother claimed to have seen shadows, and where the murals had apparently been. I wasted no time in whispering this to my two companions as we swept the bedrooms and passed furtively under the second attic hatch. It was just as we moved towards the final bedroom that we heard something on the stairs near us, the smaller staircase that was built when the house was partitioned. It was a low creaking sound, that started almost like a sigh and seemed to drag on in slow motion as we all froze and willed ourselves to turn back and look. It could have been the wood creaking as the house cooled in the dead of night. It could have been the tortured soul of an abusive father, coming to reclaim his home. I will never know, because I ran first, bolting along the corridor with my ""brave"" compatriots in tow, back towards the rest of the group (who instantly panicked at the sight of me and ran downstairs).

We did what frightened ghost hunters always do: ran straight back to the last room where we felt safe, the almost renovated living room, and slammed the door shut behind us. We immediately descended into a panting rabble, talking over each other with unanswered demands; ""what happened?"", ""did you hear it?"", ""did you see anything?"", ""was it the ghost?"", ""where's Sophie?"", ""did you break my dad's torch?"", ""are you staying over, I need a squad tonight!?""...

...Wait, where the fuck IS Sophie? Everyone froze around me ""I don't know, she was with you guys!""

""She was, but she isn't here now is she?"" Tia, my gf, was not happy with me ignoring the obvious

""She'll not be happy we left her..."" 

Matt was cut of by a muffled scream of pure terror, and the sound of feet thundering along the corridor above us. We burst back out of the living room and headed towards the stairs just as Sophie burst into the kitchen, through the door opposite, covered in tears and hyperventilating. ""I saw someone outside, then you were gone!""

""Where were you, didn't you follow us?"" Tia with the pertinent question.

""I went to the loo, I thought you were right outside. I saw someone through the window, and you left me!""

Evidently Sophie had decided to take the opportunity to finally go to the toilet, with a whole group standing guard. She claimed she hadn't heard us run, which seemed impossible given how loud a herd of teenagers would be on the old wooden floors of the house, but we were all more fixated in the question of who, or what, she had seen in the garden. We spent at least 15 minutes peering out of the downstairs windows, to no avail. Cupping our hands to the glass, peering at every trembling shrub and odlly cast shadow. But, none of us could quite bring ourselves to actually go out and look. We couldn't even brave going back upstairs for a better view. Eventually, with the help of cigarettes and alcohol, Sophie calmed down enough to explain that she thought she had seen the silhouette of a bald man passing through the yard area between the house and the outbuildings. Evidently she had frozen in fear for a moment, and simply not realized we were having our own moment of terror in the corridor outside the bathroom. Eventually we all calmed down and almost convinced ourselves that we had most likely been scared by the normal sounds of the house. Being a skeptic is sometimes necessary to preserve your own sanity, if nothing else.

By 3am we were calm enough to go to sleep, downstairs on the couches in the living room... Nobody was sleeping upstairs that night. In the morning we woke up a little hungover, and shared a smoke and a laugh about the night's events, all secretly relieved to have survived without further incident. We couldn't decide who was the most scared, so we gave up and Tia and I went to make everyone coffee. 

In the kitchen, the room right next to where we'd slept, the glass in the washing machine door was smashed and the door hinges were so buckled back on themselves that they were barely holding the frame onto the machine. This, out of everything, was the most chilling moment of the whole episode. We had been asleep in the next room and I hadn't heard a thing, but the door had clearly been exposed to significant force. How could we not have heard it? Nobody had heard a thing, and everyone claimed that they were sure the door wasn't damaged when we were trying to look for the stranger in the garden... We never really pressed the issue. 

I think Tia and I were both scared that the more we asked, the more frightening the ignorance of our friends would become. Eventually we decided to tell her parents that I had slipped and fallen into the machine whilst trying to load it- clumsy apologetic boyfriend was easier to explain than hysterical party of drunk teenagers, and definitely easier than poltergeist, although both of those latter explanations felt equally likely at the time.

I have never forgotten that night. It's the closest I've been to believing in ghosts. Writing it out now, I realise how much of the experience was built on our collective imagination and hysteria, but of the very few incidents we DID encounter, one too many remains unexplained for my liking.

She showed a lot of interest, and our conversations flowed well online.

She was from a neighboring country and spoke Spanish, while I, being from Brazil, spoke Portuguese and only knew a bit of Spanish.

Since she also knew little Portuguese, we communicated mostly in English. This language barrier made our conversations a bit challenging and sometimes kind of awkward.

We set up a date at a coffee shop. I paid the bill, and after the coffee, we decided to take a walk in a park nearby.

The weather was nice, we talked, drank coconut water, and spent about three hours together.

At one point, I asked what she was going to do afterwards. It wasn’t with any ulterior motive; I just wanted to know because I was already ready to take an Uber home.

She said she was probably going to watch a series, and then invited me to watch a movie with her at her apartment.

As soon as we agreed to watch a movie, still in the park, she started texting someone on WhatsApp.

When we got to the apartment, she asked if her friends had seen the messages, and shortly after, the house was empty.

It seemed like she had found a way to be alone with me, so I thought she wanted something more intimate.

She played some music, then chose a movie, and we started to relax.

At one point, I started kissing her, thinking that’s what she wanted, especially since she had invited me over, and it was just the two of us.

But when I tried to go a bit further, she pulled back. I was surprised because everything seemed to be heading in that direction.

The next day, her behavior changed. She became more distant, not ignoring me, but it was clear that something had shifted.

I asked if she considered herself an assertive person, and she said yes.

So I told her that if she didn’t think we were compatible, it was better to be honest so we wouldn’t waste each other’s time.

After I said that, she decided to end things right there.

She admitted that the date had been a bit strange, especially at the end (when I tried to undress her).",0,1743468663.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False

Are you following a ketogenic diet and wondering if you can still enjoy your favorite diet soda? The question of whether diet pop is keto-friendly is more complex than you might think. While zero-calorie beverages might seem like a safe bet, there are crucial factors to consider before cracking open that can of diet soda. This comprehensive guide will dive deep into the relationship between diet pop and the ketogenic diet, exploring the potential benefits, risks, and alternatives that can help you stay on track with your health and weight loss goals.

Can You Have Diet Pop on Keto? The Surprising Truth

Diet Soda and Ketosis: Breaking Down the Basics

Understanding how diet pop interacts with ketosis is essential for anyone following a ketogenic diet. While diet sodas contain zero calories and zero carbs, they aren't necessarily a free pass. The artificial sweeteners and other ingredients can potentially impact your metabolic state and overall health.

Key Considerations for Diet Soda on Keto

1. Artificial Sweeteners and Insulin Response
Contrary to popular belief, artificial sweeteners aren't completely neutral. Some studies suggest they may:
- Trigger an insulin response
- Potentially interrupt ketosis
- Affect gut microbiome health

Artificial Sweeteners: A Closer Look

Not all artificial sweeteners are created equal. Some commonly found in diet pop include:
- Aspartame
- Sucralose
- Acesulfame potassium (Ace-K)

Each of these sweeteners can have slightly different effects on your body and ketogenic diet.

Potential Health Concerns

While diet pop might seem like a safe choice, there are several potential health concerns to consider:
- Potential negative impact on gut bacteria
- Possible increased cravings for sweet foods
- Potential negative effects on metabolism

Alternatives to Diet Pop on Keto

If you're looking to stay hydrated while maintaining ketosis, consider these **keto-friendly beverage options**:
1. Water (infused with cucumber or lemon)
2. Unsweetened tea
3. Black coffee
4. Sparkling water
5. Bone broth

Expert Recommendations

Most nutritionists and keto experts recommend:
- Limiting diet pop consumption
- Prioritizing water intake
- Choosing natural, zero-calorie alternatives

Moderation is Key

If you do choose to drink diet pop while on keto:
- Consume in moderation
- Monitor your body's response
- Pay attention to any changes in ketosis or overall well-being

Scientific Insights

Research suggests that while occasional diet pop consumption may not completely derail your keto diet, frequent intake could potentially:
- Disrupt metabolic processes
- Impact insulin sensitivity
- Affect gut health

The Bottom Line on Diet Pop and Keto

While diet pop isn't explicitly forbidden on a ketogenic diet, it's not an ideal beverage choice. The potential metabolic and health impacts make it a drink to consume sparingly, if at all. Your best bet is to focus on hydration through water, herbal teas, and other natural, zero-calorie beverages that support your overall health and ketogenic lifestyle.

Ultimately, your individual response to diet pop may vary. The most important strategy is to listen to your body, monitor your ketone levels, and make informed choices that support your health and wellness goals. By staying informed and making mindful decisions, you can successfully navigate your ketogenic journey while enjoying occasional treats in moderation.

They were sitting together, laughing, and sharing a pastry like they were more than just “casual acquaintances.” I couldn’t stop staring, and when they noticed me, there was this *guilty* look on their faces.

M immediately texted me later, apologizing and telling me she didn’t want to hurt me, but she and Jake had been secretly dating for the past *three months*.

I’m honestly so blindsided. M had never mentioned anything about it, and I can’t believe she kept this from me. She said she didn’t want to tell me right away because she didn’t know if things would work out, and she didn’t want to risk our friendship.

On top of that, I’m struggling with motivation and disinterest in work, and depression has made it incredibly hard to leave the house.  

I have a dog who’s been a big support, but I could really use some genuine human connection. What I need most is to know there’s someone out there who actually wants to spend time with *me*. I’m not looking for group recommendations or event suggestions—I know those exist, but right now, I just need something personal. If you’d be open to grabbing coffee, going for a walk, or just sitting somewhere and talking, I’d really appreciate it.  

I also struggle with talking to strangers when I can’t put a face to them, so if you’re comfortable, I’d appreciate it if you could send a picture when reaching out. It just helps me feel more at ease.

  Nothing can destroy you with a porn addiction except the guilt you take on yourself even sometimes as a defense mechanism you think that other people will shame you for having those feelings of wanting to please yourself.  I think almost ALL of the people addicted to porn and when they think its an actual problem in their life im convinced that its most of fear of what others would say about your porn use.  Sex is a need.  It absolutely is in order to keep creative energy flowing.  This helps with both men and women.  

Drugs can put you in jail.  Alcohol can make you stab somebody or be stabbed. Cocaine well that will definitely get you a criminal record so now good look getting a job.  Caffeine can steal your sleep from you and destroy your nervous system with excessive use. Go to decaf and check out the stories of people who are giving up coffee and saying that life is just better without out it sometimes breaks such as 30 days or even 7 days.  

I get it, there is sometimes a consideration for our loved ones if we are in a relationship we dont want to make them feel not valued.  And so yes if one is in relationship it is practically different as compared to a single person who watches porn or masturbates frequently.  I am talking in this post, about the overhyped addictions such as porn or masturbation and my question is directed towards single people

I see nothing but positive affirmations of Self in the act of self indulging with the body.  By making love to ourselves we are experiencing tantra and releasing the divine...such as when we are in perfect flow with nature and the way the sun shimmmers and the moon beckons

So, I took a long break from reading after graduating a couple years ago. I believe I would like to slowly get back into it. I even purchased a book not too long ago that I’m trying to get through. 

Since I’ve spent so much time in solitude (working remotely full-time and going to work full-time for many years), I want to be more social more than anything. I’ve recently joined a couple of “more active” social groups. However, I would also like to try to get back into books.

The thing is, I kind of wanna be around someone while I’m reading—LOL. I don’t think I wanna do a traditional book club meet up cause I may not want to read the book that is on the list to discuss.

And as a non born and raised, I hope my perspective inspires some of y’all to sit down, polish that resume up, and *get a job*, bro.

Why?  Why are there people literally everywhere you go, every time of day?  This is the least employed city I’ve ever lived in; I’ve lived in 8 different major metropolitan areas and there are more people outside doing *fuck all* here more than fucking Manhattan.

Go to Sam’s Club at 10:30am on a Tuesday?  Packed to the brim.

Get a long weekend and go to the gym at noon on a Monday?  Filled with 49th in the nation by education children and 100 adults.  And I’m not talking old people, I mean 20-50 year olds.

Leave the office to grab a quick coffee on a Friday at 9am?  Your children are at Starbucks and McDonalds like it isn’t the middle of the fucking school year, 3 hours into the day. 

Trader Joe’s on Thursday at 1:40pm?  13,000 SAH moms who apparently all coordinated fucking up the entire plaza parking lot just for funsies.  

You cannot go *anywhere* and find order, short wait times, and not the entirety of Clark county school district disorderly breaking shit. 

What’s up?  The GDP of this place is lower than the percent of the populous we make up.  Since we’re FORTY NINTH in education: this means “bad,” okay?  Why is there no industry here besides Wow car wash and the strip?  Legitimately what is going on?  Where are the JOBS?

Shit, get a ring camera!  Every fucking notification is a lost dog, there’s like 30 lost dogs a day running around the fucking city, too.  The entirety of this city is unemployed and outside.  Retirees, parents, all the children, the family dog, shit your hamster is probably outside right now fucking up the chipotle line.  

Please get a job, please keep your children inside of the fucking school so one of them can get good grades, grow up, and bring some fucking industry here so the entire populous isn’t wanderlust, zombie-ing about the streets at all hours.  Shit is so weird, there is literally never a reprieve.  

I went to a taqueria at 1:40 in the fucking morning on a Wednesday and waited behind 7 people; GET A JOB *FUCK*

1joimo1,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russ_Martin,We snuck a lingerie clad chicken into a live radio show for VIP tickets and it worked.,"From 2000 to 2003, I lived a double life.

By day, I delivered pizza across the backroads and neighborhoods of Saginaw, Texas. But during those long, winding drives, I wasn’t alone. I had a voice riding shotgun—Russ Martin. 105.3 FM. Loud, unapologetic, often insane. His radio show was a lifeline, a chaotic current in the background of my life.

It was 2002 when things took a turn.

Russ was hyping up the one- or maybe two-year anniversary bash for 105.3—this massive blowout planned for the Ennis Texas Speedway. VIP tickets were going for $105.30, a clever nod to the frequency. But then… Russ said something that made me freeze, controller in hand, while mid-race in Wipeout on my PS2.

“If anyone brings me a live goat in a schoolgirl outfit,” he said, “or a live chicken in a G-string, with lipstick on its beak—I’ll give you a pair of VIP tickets. Free.”

My friend Big Daddy—yes, Big Daddy—was sprawled on the couch behind me, eating a fistful of off-brand corn chips and drinking a Milwaukees Best. We lived together in a rundown rental that always smelled like wet carpet and pizza grease.

I paused the game. The radio hummed in the background like it was daring me.

I turned slowly to Big Daddy and said the words that would mark the beginning of a very slippery slope:

“Big Daddy… how much do you think a live chicken costs?”

He didn’t even blink. “Depends,” he said. “You want a fat one?”

Right then, something shifted in the room. The air got heavy. Like destiny had entered the chat.

Because we weren’t joking. Not really.

We were thinking.

Plotting.

The internet was slow back then—dial-up slow—so we were on our own. No YouTube tutorials. No Etsy for chicken lingerie. Just two idiots with a dream and a rapidly unraveling moral compass.

Within the hour, we were in my busted Eagle Talon, heading toward the edge of town, chasing rumors about a guy who sold livestock out of the back of his property. We didn’t even have a plan for how to explain why we needed a chicken, much less how we were going to apply lipstick to a beak.

But one thing was certain:

Russ Martin had thrown down the gauntlet.

And we were picking it up.

The man who sold us the chicken didn’t ask many questions.

Just grunted, took our cash, and pointed to a wire cage where half a dozen birds clucked aimlessly in the dirt. We chose one that looked cooperative—or at least, not actively hostile. Got it into a pet carrier with only minor bloodshed. Ours, not the bird’s.

Mission Part One: Acquire chicken — complete.

Then came Part Two: Outfit the chicken.

We drove straight to the only place open late that carried the kind of depravity we needed—a dingy sex shop tucked between a payday loan office and an abandoned laundromat. This place had everything: racks of DVDs nobody admitted to owning, suspiciously sticky shelves of toys, and a wall of blow-up dolls with faces frozen in horror.

We asked the clerk for the smallest, skimpiest G-string they had. He raised an eyebrow, gave us a once-over, and didn’t ask a single question. Just led us to a rack near the back, where we found a tiny scrap of lace and elastic that barely qualified as clothing.

It was perfect.

Mission Part Two: Chicken lingerie — secured.

Next stop: the dollar store. We needed lipstick. Not just any lipstick—we needed the loudest, most promiscuous shade available. The kind of red that screamed “I make bad decisions and I’m proud of them.”

We found it.

One dollar.

The packaging actually said “Hot Tamale #69.”

Back at the house, we set the pet carrier on the table and laid out our tools like we were prepping for surgery. The G-string. The lipstick. The bird. The clock was ticking. We needed to present this chicken in all of it's accoutrment to the Russ Martin Show the next day if we wanted to get these tickets.

But we were missing something.

Not something—someone.

We looked at each other. Same thought.

Big Steve.

We needed a third man. Someone with the right balance of unshakable calm and just enough bad judgment to join a plan this deranged without hesitation. And Steve… Steve had that energy.

I picked up the phone.

He answered on the second ring.

“You guys up to something?” he asked, not even a hello.

I said, “We need your help. It involves a live chicken, a G-string, and lipstick.”

He paused. Then said:

“…What time?.”

The next day began like any other—except we were hungover, disoriented, and about to smuggle a half-naked chicken into a radio station.

I woke up to the kind of headache that feels like your skull is caving in from the inside. The room spun. My mouth felt like I’d licked a shag carpet soaked in whiskey.

But then I remembered.

Today was the day.

3:00 p.m. sharp, the Russ Martin Show would go live—with a full studio audience. It was Friday, and Fridays were loud, chaotic, and full of moments that became legend in DFW radio history.

I staggered down the hall and pounded on Big Daddy’s door.

“Wake up,” I said through the haze. “Today’s the day.”

No hesitation. He opened the door immediately, eyes bloodshot but locked in.

“I know,” he said. “Let’s do this.”

We got to work dressing our accomplice—Henrietta. That’s what we’d decided to call her. It struck the right tone: classy, a little vintage, and just ridiculous enough to carry a G-string with dignity.

The operation was delicate. Chickens are not known for their patience or style sense. It took two of us to gently strap the scandalous little thing into her new black lace wardrobe. Then came the lipstick. Hot Tamale #69. Big Daddy held her steady while I applied it like we were prepping her for a red carpet.

She looked like she belonged on a Vegas marquee.

We popped her into the pet carrier, gave her a few calming words, then jumped into the car to grab our third man—Big Steve.

Steve climbed in with a smirk, took one look at Henrietta, nodded, and said, “She’s ready.”

And just like that, we were off—three men and one glam-rock chicken in a Corolla barreling toward destiny. From Fort Worth to Dallas, the highway hummed beneath us, nerves growing with each mile.

We pulled into the parking lot of a towering 23-story office building—the headquarters of 105.3 FM.

We were here.

We strutted through the glass front doors like men on a mission, Henrietta swaying in her carrier like a silent co-conspirator. The lobby was all business suits, polished marble, and echoes of clacking heels. We didn’t belong—but we didn’t care.

We stepped into the elevator and hit 14—the floor we thought housed the Russ Martin studio.

The elevator dinged.

The doors opened.

And we stepped out… directly into hell.

It wasn’t the studio.

It was the building manager’s office.

A massive floor, Scarface-style—leather furniture, floor-to-ceiling windows, and at the center of it all, a desk. Behind it sat a woman who looked like she had been forged from scowls and expired coffee.

She narrowed her eyes the second she saw us.

Then she shrieked, “What is that in your hands?!”

Big Daddy held up the carrier. “It’s a chicken,” he said cheerfully. “For Russ!”

She was not amused.

“This is a professional building,” she snapped. “You can’t just bring livestock in here! Get out! NOW!”

And with that, she began physically escorting us back toward the elevator. Henrietta clucked in protest.

That was it. The dream was dying in a whimper of feathers and shame.

But fate wasn’t done with us yet.

Halfway down—the elevator stopped.

The doors opened…

And in stepped Eddie Boyd, program director of the Russ Martin Show.

He looked at us.

He looked at the chicken.

He blinked.

“…What the hell do you boys have there?” he asked.

We told him, in glorious, overlapping panic:

“It’s the chicken! The one Russ said he’d give VIP tickets for! She’s got the G-string! The lipstick! She’s ready!”

He looked like he wanted to laugh but didn’t quite know if he should.

Then he said, “Listen. We can’t let you bring her up. Not through the lobby. Not like this. But go outside. Listen to the show. We’ll figure it out. Call us.”

The elevator doors closed.

We stood there in the lobby, hearts pounding, chicken softly clucking in her little satin prison.

We weren’t done yet.

Not by a long shot.

We were escorted out the front doors like criminals. Henrietta clucked softly in her carrier, unaware she was now a fugitive.

Back at the car, Big Steve pulled out his phone and called the studio. “We’re not leaving,” he said. “This chicken’s getting her fifteen minutes of fame, or we die trying.”

A few minutes later, a man from the station approached with a shipping box.

“You guys the ones with the chicken?”

“Yes, sir.”

“I’m gonna smuggle her in,” he said. “They really want her inside.”

We loaded Henrietta into the box. He turned and marched toward the building like a soldier on a mission.

Five minutes later, he returned—shaking his head.

“Security’s on high alert. They’ve got someone at every entrance. They're checking every package now. We’re not getting her in.”

Meanwhile, we had the show blasting through the car radio. They were talking about us. The whole segment was about how to smuggle a chicken in lingerie into the building.

We weren’t just part of the show anymore. We were the show.

That’s when we saw it.

A UPS truck, parked in the back of the building near a dimly lit stairwell. No security. No suits. Just a back door… slightly ajar.

We looked at each other.

“Go.”

We left the car running, grabbed Henrietta, and sprinted—three grown men with a chicken in lingerie, ducking behind a brown truck like we were planning a heist.

After ten long minutes of waiting, the back door opened.

We moved fast.

Flight after flight of stairs. Sweating, gasping, Henrietta rattling in her carrier as we climbed. Four floors. Seven. Ten. Fourteen.

We burst through the final door.

And there it was.

The Russ Martin Studio.

And they were live.

We didn’t hesitate.

We marched into that studio like war heroes, crashing into the broadcast mid-show. The audience erupted. Laughter. Cheers. Applause. We were drenched in sweat, out of breath, and clutching a chicken in stripperwear.

We. Fucking. Made it.

The entire staff took photos with Henrietta. Russ laughed so hard he nearly cried. They gave us the VIP tickets on the spot, clapped us on the back, and called us legends.

We basked in that glory. That bizarre, feather-filled glory.

And when the excitement died down, I turned to Russ and asked:

“Hey, uh… can we take the elevator down this time?”

He grinned. “Of course, boys. And please—tell security thank you on your way out.”

Three guys. One chicken. A dream made real.

Radio history was written that day.

And her name… was Henrietta.

I'm from the glorious nation of Mexico, I am a mediocre architecture student, autistic, self-proclaimed cinephile (My letterboxd is in my profile), history enthusiast (Only the 20th century tho and my favorite event is the cold war), not homophobic and I'm currently studying some languages but lately I had a burnout so I am taking a little break from learning and I also used to play the piano but because I am always tired from school I stopped playing. I like drinking stuff: Water, coffee, beer and soda are my favorites. Tea is very good too, but it is not one of my favorites. I prefer traveling by bus over car. I quit smoking three months ago and I don't really talk to people but now I think it's time that I get a friend but I text people and they never answer so I have now decided to write my own post and (hopefully) be chosen instead of choosing.

Some music I like: Radiohead, Rammstein, Nena and Interpol, but I listen to a lot more music.

I play videogames but mostly single player FPS and the only online game I like and I occasionally play is Team Fortress 2.

I would like to have a friend who cares about me and after we feel confident enough with each other we could even VC, just don't be under 18 years old.

It all started with me about a year ago when I met him I didn't want anything from him but his friendship. He didn't pressure me, but slowly I started liking the guy as we got to know each other. eventually we got together in November, but tell me why he broke up with me last night and says it's because I deserve better than him.

Long story short he has a really bad jealousy problem and I was telling him how a coworker and I were talking about our cats (the coworker is a guy) and he got jealous and mad about it, said ""I'm acting dumb and I don't want to keep wasting your time you deserve better""

And told me it was over. Idk wtf but that was the stupidest excuse ever and I've never been so heartbroken and pissed off at a breakup ever. I just feel like theres more to it and idk I'm just trying to see how to handle this situation because wtf?!

Also, I just found out he sent a girl a e-gift card for coffee and when I called him out on it last night, he said ""What so-so has brought you coffee?"" (A male coworker) but the thing here is that that coworker and I would NEVER! And I've told him countless times.

I haven’t seen a dentist since I aged out of free dental care from the NHS- so about 17 years. I know… terrible. I have paralysingly bad fear of the dentist and have tried to avoid it as much as possible, as ignorant as that is. 

My wife tried to take clear photos of my problem tooth but it’s not super clear- I’m pretty sure I had a filling on my molars (top and bottom) as a kid. Have circled the tooth that I think is causing the issue; I say ‘think’ because most of the time, it doesn’t bother me at all. I’ve noticed that when I’m in a bad pain flare from my chronic conditions, I get these electrical zap pains around that area and then excruciating pain in my jaw/ear/sinus on that side. When it’s not bothering me, I can prod the tooth with my finger/tongue and it doesn’t hurt at all- in fact, most of the time when it’s actively hurting me, it’s not the tooth itself that hurts the most. It’s the side of my face. 

Should I make an emergency dentist appointment tomorrow? It’s 1am here now. What are they likely to tell me? 

The last photo of my front tooth is also something bothering me- they don’t hurt at all, never had any pain or sensitivity from them. What can I do to make them healthy again? 

Thank you so much. I feel like I’m going insane from pain and lack of sleep.",1,1743465750.0,askdentists,2,1.0,False

Johnny Blaze was a spectral blur astride his infernal motorcycle against the ebbing night of the New York streets, fading in and out of visibility as he raced between preternaturally dark shadows. Despite Blaze’s efforts to keep a low profile, Jack's Darkdevil senses more than allowed them to follow the myriad lies swirling around the Ghost Rider, be they his own or belonging to the many sinners to whom he had presented penance over the years.

As they navigated the shady backroads, Jack’s mind was racing much like the Rider’s bike. What would Lucifer have gotten out of forcing them to massacre the Tracksuit Mafia? How had this skeletal leatherhead pinpointed their location so quickly? What pressing purpose did the Ghost Rider have in seeking them out? These questions gnawed at Jack, their answers as elusive as the shadows they chased.

Eventually, Jack dropped into a secluded alley where Johnny Blaze was waiting, still and silent like a statue. Jack, cloaked in the guise of Darkdevil, approached cautiously. The transformation into Devilmode suppressed any flicker of fear, replacing it with an unsettling dread, a sensation that skirted the edges of terror but never fully embraced it.

“So I guess you’re not here to eat my soul, right? Or you would have done it already,” Jack ventured, their tone mixing defiance with genuine inquiry.

Blaze chuckled lightly but he was clearly not amused. “No, that’s not what I’m here for. You can drop the devil glam now, you know.”

Jack shook their head; the idea of relinquishing Devilmode’s affects right now was unthinkable. “I’m better like this, for now.”

Blaze sighed, then reintroduced himself. “Well, I’m Johnny Blaze, and I’m—”

“The Ghost Rider,” Jack interrupted. “I know. The bike really gives it away.”

“More importantly,” Blaze continued, gritting his teeth, “I’m the King of Hell.”

“What!?” Darkdevil exclaimed. “King of..? But you’re…”

“Well, technically I’m one part of what the lesser devils these days call Hell’s Triumvirate,” Blaze conceded.

Jack’s eyes narrowed, unconvinced. “I thought Lucifer was the King of Hell. You know, Satan.”

Blaze smirked, a wry twist to his lips. “So it is ol’ Lucy you’re dealing with. Thanks for confirming my suspicion.”

“Dealt,” Jack corrected him. “Past tense.”

“All those drug dealers’ bodies looked pretty present tense to me,” Blaze maintained. “And seeing as you’re clearly just a kid, I’d sure hope it wasn’t you behind the wheel back there.”

Jack said nothing. 

“Right. So, ol’ Lucy. Lucifer was Satan a whole long time ago, right after the whole fallen angel thing. The original. But Hell has its politics, just like Earth,” Blaze explained. “When I first got in the game, the Satan was this devil called Mephisto. He tricked me; made me into the Ghost Rider and killed my old man.”

“Then you took his place?” asked Jack.

“Not quite,” Johnny replied. “I knocked him off his throne, put someone else in his place, but it didn’t exactly work out. So I teamed up with the guy, and we took Hell back together.”

Jack interjected, a frown creasing their brow. “So you took out the devil that killed your dad, then put him back on the throne?”

Johnny’s expression hardened, frustrated. “You weren’t there. It was the lesser of two evils, believe me. Me and my *other associate* wield enough power to veto just about anything Mephisto does that we don’t agree with, like smoking you for being a rival devil’s secret weapon.”

“Well, thanks!” Jack snarked.

“You’re welcome!” Blaze replied in turn. 

“So, this is about Lucifer trying to climb back to the top?” Jack surmised, trying to piece together the far-out infernal politics.

“Exactly,” Johnny nodded. “And if he gets back to his old tricks, it could throw off the whole cosmic balance we’ve worked hard to establish.”

Feeling a stray surge of boldness, Jack asked, “So, what do you need me to do about it?”

Johnny looked surprised, then thoughtful. “Honestly, there’s not much you can do about Lucifer directly. He’s got you right where he wants you.”

“Well it’s not like you sat down and took it when your Mephisto had you on a short leash, right?”

Blaze scoffed. “Touché,” he conceded. “Got a silver tongue there, like your old man.”

“You knew my dad?” Jack said without thinking. 

“We had a couple of run-ins over the years,” Johnny replied. Then Jack realised, and a pit emerged in their stomach.

*How did he know? Was it just the suit giving it away, or—?*

“If you’re wondering how I know about Murdock,” the Ghost Rider smirked, “Lucy would’ve used infernal magic to make your deal. All of us down below, in Hell? We’re exempt. Can’t have Hell’s denizens messing with each other’s minds, it’s just messy. That was Victor’s idea.”

*So the spell was intact.* Jack relaxed. They watched as Johnny adjusted his seat on his bike.

“The good news is Mephisto lost the bet, and I don’t have to kill you,” Blaze added. “Really was worried you were fully your devil’s puppet. But no, you might make it out of this yet.”

“He takes control whenever *a comet is in the sky*,” Jack replied, far from seeing a clear path forward.

“That’s almost never,” said a cocksure Blaze, furrowing his brow. But then, “Which is why you agreed, got it.” He revved his motorcycle’s engine. “But we live in strange times, clearly Lucy knew something would change that you didn’t.”

“So what do I do?” asked Jack. There had to be some order they could follow, some plan they could cling to. Anything but more fumbling about in the dark. 

“My advice?” Johnny tapped in the bike’s tibial kickstand. “Keep your head on straight. Push back where you can. Me and the boys’ll try and nip this Lucifer thing in the bud before his master plan can manifest.”

“You make it sound easy,” said Jack, shaking their head.

Johnny smiled faintly. “Well, I assure you, it’s not. I’ll be in touch when we know more.”

With that, Johnny Blaze took over out of the alley, the roaring motorcycle engine echoing off the alley walls as he disappeared as swiftly as he had first appeared, leaving Jack to reckon with their place in this new world.

A short while later, the crimson-horned Darkdevil slipped through the bedroom window as the first light of dawn painted the sky, the routine now as familiar as the layout of their own room. The ease with which Jack moved in the long shadows had become a small comfort, a brief respite from the chaos that their life had spiraled into. But as they stood there, silhouetted against the soft glow of the morning, hesitation gripped them.

With a trembling hand, Jack reached up to their heart and silently commanded the transformation to reverse. The fiery essence of Darkdevil receded, and the costume dissolved into nothingness, replaced by the mundane comfort of their sleepwear. It was a process they had seen countless times, yet today it felt like stripping away their very flesh.

As the last ember of Devilmode extinguished, the floodgates opened. The absence of fear that had so defined their alter ego was suddenly overrun by a deluge of pent-up terror and anxiety. Their whole body began to quiver violently, and they sank to their knees, the cold floor a harsh contrast to their fevered skin.

Jack dragged themself into bed, and pulled the covers close. Tears streamed down their face, unbidden and uncontrollable, sobs wracking their body with a ferocity that left them breathless. 

“Please,” Jack whispered between sobs, their voice breaking under the weight of their own fear. “I don't know what I'm doing. Please, just... help me stop this.”

The room was silent save for the sound of their crying, giving no response to their plea. As the first rays of sun crept across their bed, Jack felt small and alone, wrestling with the enormity of the night’s bloodshed, and the terrifying uncertainty of what they might yet be forced to do. They clung to the covers, a lifeline in the swirling storm of their emotions, muttering through tears, *“Create in me a clean heart, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from your presence, and take not your Holy Spirit from me.”*

The sun was high in the sky, piercing through the lofty skylight as Grace Murdock sat at the kitchen island in a daze, prisoner to her restless thoughts. Jack was still asleep upstairs, as teenagers were wont to be on a Saturday. Grace, however, had spent the whole morning moving through the day mechanically, making coffee she didn't feel like drinking, grappling with thoughts that seemed to defy her.

One thing bothered her especially. And that was Foggy.

Everything had changed when Foggy died. When Foggy had his heart attack. Chief among them, Matt’s disappearance, abandoning Grace and Jack. But it wasn’t the abandonment Grace lingered on. Not on how Matt reacted to his best friend’s death, but how Grace had reacted to the death of her friend and the godfather of her child. 

Nobody knew what had killed Foggy; why he had the heart attack seemingly out of nowhere. No, nobody seemed to even question it. She had mourned her friend while she mourned her husband, but Grace couldn’t recall once wondering what had brought the damn heart attack on. 

*How could she have accepted it so easily? Could it have been foul play? Was there more to it?* But, most importantly, *why was she only wondering this now?*

The more she pondered, the more she felt a disconnect with her past actions. It was unlike her not to dig deeper, not to question every inconsistency. To leave no room for injustice for her friend. Her memory of those days felt blurred, as if the edges of her grief had been smoothed over. It was enough to give her headaches.

As she pondered, lost in her brewing doubts, the front door opened, snapping her back to reality. 

“Just grabbing something from the study,” said Matt, moving through the open-plan kitchen quickly, his cane collapsed in his hand. She knew he had no use for it in a place as familiar as their home.

But Grace put herself in his path. “Matt, we need to talk,” she said abruptly, her voice more strained than she intended.

“What’s wrong, is Jack okay?” Matt's concern was immediate, his body tensing as he prepared for another blow, another problem to fix or forgive himself for not preventing.

“It’s about… us,” Grace continued, her temples pounding with a throbbing that seemed to crescendo with her rising anxiety.

Matt paused, a somber resignation settling over him. “Okay,” he said, his voice low, already bracing for the familiar guilt that had become his constant companion since his return. “I should have realised it then, I shouldn’t have left. It helped no-one, and it hurt everyone.”

“No, it’s not that,” Grace pressed on, her frustration mounting alongside the inexplicable tinnitus ringing in her ears. “I understand why you had to leave after Foggy, I do. It’s just… I can’t escape the feeling that there’s something else…”

“I wouldn’t lie to you about that,” Matt gripped her hand tight.

“And I believe you,” Grace replied, squeezing his hand back. “But maybe you can’t trust yourself. Maybe I can’t trust myself…”

Matt said nothing.

“There’s something…” Grace gritted her teeth. “Something… it hurts to think about. Something to do with…”

She trailed off, struggling to articulate the nebulous suspicion that had taken root in her mind. The silence stretched between them, heavy and expectant.

“Something to do with Daredevil. The more I try to think about him, the more I feel my thoughts push him away,” she finally managed, the words causing a sharp spike in her temple, her face silently contorting in pain.

Matt’s response was hesitant, his hand rising to rub at his own temple as if to ward off a similar pain. “Well?” Grace demanded, her impatience fueled by her discomfort.

“I feel the same thing,” Matt admitted, his voice tinged with a confusion that mirrored her own. ""Something about the Devil of Hell’s Kitchen. History between him and me, but I just can’t put my…""

He paused, struggling to find the right words, then blurted out, “After Father Lantom, I’ve been looking into this new one, this *Darkdevil*. And as of this morning, it’s not just Paul. They’ve massacred what was left of the Tracksuits.”

Grace’s vision swam, the room tilting as Matt's words seemed to echo around her. He was too caught up in his own confession to notice at first.

“I shouldn’t have kept it from you and I’m sorry I did, it’s just… I felt like I was going crazy. But you felt it too. And I know you’re going to say it’s not my problem, but, for some reason… I feel like…""

His voice trailed off as he finally noticed her silence. “Grace?” he raised an eyebrow, his heart racing.

But Grace could no longer respond. The room spun faster, and darkness edged her vision until it swallowed her whole.

“Grace!?” Matt's voice was the last thing she heard before succumbing to the void, his alarm echoing in her ears as she collapsed.

Though I wish it wasn't.,"My 5 year relationship broke in the start of 2024. That was my first partner and I know more about how to maintain a relationship in the long run rather than the first stages.


I've been on dates a few months after, I don't want to seem rude but my god... Why is every date that I've had be boring?

Like I'm the one who's carrying the conversation and asking questions and they're the one giving basic 1 sentence responses to all of them, like if they weren't interested why did you accept going on a date with me in the first place, let alone going on more dates after the first. Surely I'm not worth a cup of coffee or a free meal, right?

It's like they got no interests or directions in life, like I've tried to maybe find a thing they're passionate about and ask them about it, I'm not even joking, one just said they like going on insta & tiktok and they're not interested in anything else.


I'm not that interested in the physical aspect because I know long term that dies out eventually so that ain't my priority.

My priority for finding a partner is just finding someone that has similar interests to me. Keyword, similar. Not identical. Because I know if we don't have similar interests and we don't like whatever the other person likes it'll feel like a chore rather than actually enjoying it.


Like in the past year or so I've been on a dozen or 2 dates, but they've all been boring, there's no spark. I'm starting to blame myself. Or sometimes I'm blaming social media or this generation's idea of dating.

Like my interests are broad, I used to study medicine, if you got an interest in chemistry or biology or even animals I can probably have a good convo. Gaming, don't care about which one, I've played hundreds. I'm currently studying theatre, talk about any movie or TV show? But it feels like every date I had, they have nothing to be passionate towards.

The day Abbie and Lana got mauled and eaten to death by the brutal, ruthless, and coffee-addicted demon, Miss Circle.

Everyone was gathered around the deceased bodies of the two children, clamoring. They were mortified by the sight of their mangled bodies, causing some to even puke. 

The students were told to go straight home and not speak of any of this outside of school or they’d be expelled. 

The teachers on the other hand, had to find a way to cover up the evidence, but Principal Grace suggested to just let them rot and let nature do its work. 

Miss Circle, Bloomie, and Thavel were huddled together, Bloomie snickering at bodies. She found just as much amusement in it as Circle did, but Thavel was speechless, frozen in absolute shock as she saw her two favorite students, Lana and Abbie, DEAD…

Thavel couldn’t believe how heartless Circle truly was, but after all demons are pure evil. They can’t be saved, no matter how hard you try…

Miss Thavel stammered out four words, these words being the only things she could spit out at the moment:

It teaches a group students with disabilities (I'm autistic) employability skills through class and volunteer work around places like hospitals and hotels with the end goal of finding and maintaining employment. There are 3 (unpaid) internship rotations; each about 10 weeks long, where a student interviews for and works at a different department each rotation. My program’s located at a hospital, so some of the different departments include stuff like Patient Transport and Food & Nutrition. This past month was the beginning of our third and final internship rotations. I originally interviewed for Nursing Support, which would have me restocking the supply cabinets for nurses on the 5th floor of the hospital as well as cleaning the coffee stations. I was excited because I was given the chance to work independently and I take pride in my ability to organize. I came in on my first day and had no trouble doing all the assigned tasks (restocking, cleaning, organizing, etc.). But the next day, I was pulled aside by one of the mentors in the program.

Susan informed me that I was removed from NS and would be working with her in Environmental Services (cleaning the shower and break rooms in the On-Call suite) for the rest of the school year. The reason she gave me was that I kept leaving behind the two people who were training me (one of the other mentors and one of my fellow interns) to use the bathroom and “walk around” and that I was too loud on the 5th floor. And y'know what? Fair enough. I sometimes struggle with speaking below a whisper, and I could've communicated more clearly with the other mentor (call him “Darren”) when I was either running to the bathroom or getting more supplies to restock the cabinets with. Hell, I could've even set a timer for my bathroom breaks to manage my time more efficiently. But in the moment, I didn't know all of those things were issues because again, I did all the assigned tasks no problem. I just wish Susan and Darren had a conversation with me before switching me to EVS to discuss what I need to work on in NS (communication and time-management) or even give me a chance to do a better job. But instead, they told me “I blew it” and that “I need to learn how to work”. I thought that was the whole point of this program, but I digress. I don't mind having to stay in EVS. Sure it's boring, tedious, and feels a little weird given Susan (the mentor I'm working with) is an older white woman and I'm the only black student in the program (one's white, the rest are Hispanic). But it's a job I *can* do and do well. The problem is that her and Darren made a decision about me without my knowledge or consent. In a later conversation with Darren, he said the reason why they didn't talk to me beforehand was “due to my mental health”. I recently lost my mom to breast cancer and fell into a depression for a few months. A monster truck isn't as big as this excuse. Because regardless of my health, I should be given the proper guidance needed to build up my job skills. As proven by my case manager’s efforts to help me find a part-time job outside of the program. But no matter how many times I tried explaining to Darren and Susan that A: I just wanted clearer communication and guidance from them, and B: that I have **NO PROBLEM** staying in EVS, they just kept skirting around the issue. Basically telling me “I'm sorry *you* feel that way, but you should've known better. And no matter how many times you whine and pout, you're not getting NS back."" So now, I feel like I'm losing my head. I know in my gut that this feels wrong and unfair, but there's also this nagging voice in my head telling me “What's the difference between cleaning in EVS and restocking in NS? You're still helping the people who work here. You're just being picky.” I have talked to some folks about it, including my Granny and my Dad, and most agree that the situation is BS. But those feelings of “Should I have known better?” and “This feels super wrong” keep budding heads and will only continue to do so in these last 2 months of the program. I don't know what advice y'all can give me. I don't even know if people will see this. I just need some kind of confirmation that I haven't lost it. ",3,1743464522.0,TrueOffMyChest,4,0.8,False

I just want to declare my intention to give up caffeine this month. I've read a lot of posts on here that are very inspiring, motivating, and encouraging. There's also some not so inspiring posts (haha) but, everyone's journey is different. 

Last month, a friend and I endeavored to do a 72-hour caffeine fast. it was nice to have some accountability and to know there was someone else doing it alongside me. Anyway, when the day came where I could finally have caffeine, I decided I wanted to keep going. I was definitely feeling sub-optimal in some ways but, I did notice some interesting positive benefits, even after a few days:

* Way less anxiety
* Way more present
* Time seemed to slow down
* I was feeling the full gamut of emotions - bursts of laughter and tears
* The world seemed to look more beautiful and vibrant

Of course, I dealt with the usual acute withdrawal symptoms but, the benefits I experienced were exciting and interesting. Anyway, I caved on the day I was participating in a Tough Mudder. I thought, 'well, might as well give myself an edge and ensure successful completion of the course.' I kept holding off on the coffee but finally caved, thinking I needed it. I was really hoping to feel a euphoric feeling after abstaining for now 94 hours but nope. I immediately felt my heart beat uncomfortably faster, I became irritated, short-tempered, angry even, and even started behaving like a dick with my friends. It made me realize that I've been glorifying a toxic substance (for me, anyway). Anyway, that set me back onto the caffeine train and was consuming just as much, sometimes even more, following the race. That was a month ago and now I'm determined to go decaf again, this time for much longer.

It just seems dumb to need to consume caffeine everyday to function. I know the withdrawals suck but, it's either embrace the suck now, or just keep suffering the same vicious cycle. Out of curiosity, I just really want to know what's on the other side of this addiction. I know there's something positive on the other side. Just gotta embrace the suck for a little bit. The time to start never seems convenient or like it's the right time. But life is always gonna life. If not now, when?

Anyway, tomorrow is Day 1 and I'm praying the withdrawals aren't too bad and don't last too long. But, I know it'll take as long as it's going to take.

Hoping to make it to my goal of 1 month caffeine-free and pray I have something inspiring/encouraging to share following this month long experience/experiment.

1johooa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/1johooa/new_la_wouldnt_even_last_two_months/,New L.A. Wouldn't Even Last Two Months,"Spoilers for Chapter 5 of Xenoblade Chronicles X.

None of this is a legitimate criticism of the game itself. It's fiction, and every design decision was made with an aesthetic vision in mind over realism, which I enjoy very much in its own right. These are just thoughts I've had stewing around in my head since I played the WiiU version. Don't take it too seriously.

That said, realistically speaking, the design of New L.A. and its operations are horrifically inefficient and wasteful, and would not even last two months for Elma to find us.

Let's start with the city itself, which is currently hard limited by its outer walls, which don't afford a lot of space on the inside compared to a real city. In such a situation, you'd want to build tall, not wide, in order to maximize your usable space. Yet the only tall buildings are located in the administrative district, while the commercial and residential areas bafflingly consist of single-story shops and single-family residences with lawns, no less. As if there weren't more important things to use limited amounts of fresh water on.

And speaking of the commercial district, why the hell are we making so many consumer goods and selling them in store fronts? Skells are only given to BLADE members who go through rigourous training and testing in part because of how scarce the parts are to make and maintain them. Why are we wasting these parts on televisions and coffee makers? Or worst of all...

...cars. This has got to be the single greatest offender for me. Really? Cars? In a city this small? With resources this limited? We're wasting valuable materials on private taxis, which requires wasting more city space on wide roads and parking lots, instead of some sort of mass transit system? No wonder the city is struggling. I know the city still technically has room to expand inside the walls, but that space will run out eventually, and you'll have to tear down what you've already built in order to create more usable space.

And again, it seems like they're sold the same way they are on Earth? Guys, we're out here trying to *survive*. Maybe we should save the capitalism for *after* we defeat the Ganglion and establish a safer perimiter around the city, and figure out a way to distribute resources more equitably and according to needs.

Los Angeles is probably the worst city you could pick to model a far-flung space colony after. It's basically 90% low-density urban sprawl. The exact opposite of what New L.A. needs. Surely it's possible to emulate the aesthetics of the city save for its propensity for low-density?

Los Angeles is probably the worst possible city to model a far-flung space colony after. 90% of it is low-density urban sprawl, exactly the opposite of what New L.A. needs. Surely, they could model the aesthetic while building more practically?

But that's enough of the city. How about those mimeosomes? Man, I don't even want to think about the science that goes into perfectly emulating *every* function of the human body. If humanity was that advanced before project exodus, I feel like making a Ganglion-Obliterator 4000 would have been easy, but I digress.

But that's just the concern... did we have to emulate *every* function of the human body? Eating is probably the most redudant function to include save for waste disposal, which you have to include with an eating function. Mimeosomes should be built to operate purely on electricity, which is much more obtainable and renewable than food, at least for New L.A.

Any and all food should be preserved and stored for when the Lifehold is recovered and organic bodies, which actually need that food, are made to replace mimeosomes... which, as an aside, begs the question as to why they didn't make those organic bodies in the first place. As it stands, not only is that food being wasted on literal robots, but it also wastes valuable time spent cooking, and valuable space to set up kitchens, both of which could be put to more immediate survival purposes.

And hold on, mimeosomes were made so that humans' digitized consciousness' could control them from the Lifehold's central mainframe, which was made instead of loading actual people onto the white whale because you could digitize millions of people's brains as opposed to a couple ten thousands real human bodies, right? But don't mimeosomes take up as much space as an organic human body? And don't mimeosomes take even more resources to build compared to loading up pre-existing organic humans? Unless there's something I'm missing here...

Now, I get that everything I've criticized here exists because the designers and administrators of project exodus wanted every survivor to forget about their artificial bodies and live comfortably as they did back home. But this is a survival situation. Consumer goods and unnecessary lattes don't help much against giant monsters and genocidal aliens right outside your walls. And comfort doesn't feel so good when you're dead.

Everyone aboard the White Whale would have been hand-selected as a top of the top member of some field of study that would benefit the project's survival and success. With few exceptions, these should be people fully prepared and understanding of the fact that comfort and luxury will need to be sacrificed in favor of survival. At least in the short term.

And yet, so many side quests in the series have you interacting with citizens of New L.A. who are either stupid, incompetent, mean, or a combination of all three. Seriously? You can't make a coffee? How the hell did you get a spot on humanity's last hope to avoid extinction? Why the hell are these guys acting like middle school bullies to Irina? Did project exodus not screen you guys for brain damage?

So yeah. It's a miracle that New L.A. has survived this long. Most of the credit for which can probably be chalked up to divine intervention. And knowing the lore of the Xeno- games, probably isn't unlikely.

And again, don't take this post too seriously. None of this affects my enjoyment of the game and isn't meant as sincere criticism. It's just a fun thought exercise.",45,1743464359.0,Xenoblade_Chronicles,18,0.9,False

1joheyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1joheyz/catering_prices_for_a_wholesale_breakfast_burrito/,Catering prices for a wholesale breakfast burrito business,"Hello everybody,

I currently operate a wholesale breakfast burrito business where I make and sell breakfast burritos locally to different gas stations, coffee shops and grocery stores. Right now I am breaking into the catering business for office meetings, events/ really anything casual to grab a quick breakfast burrito. I am having difficulty trying to price my burritos out for catering and could use a hand getting an idea of what people are willing to pay for this kind of service.

Some context, I live in a boujee town with lots of wealth and high prices. My burritos cost roughly $4.45 to make including ingredients, labor and overhead - I wholesale them on average at $6.00 - They retail at most locations at $8.50 (average price in town). I wholesale an additional dipping sauce at $0.50 and retails for $1.00.

I currently have a business looking to cater 170 burritos for their employees that could possibly lead to recurring orders in the future. This is a massive order for me, roughly double what I sell per day. I am having difficulty understanding the catering market and what business are willing to spend on their employees. My cost per burrito really wouldn't change all that much since it would be a fairly similar process for what I do with my current wholesale accounts. I also would really like to break into this market and acquire more large corporate accounts.

I guess what it comes down to should I base my prices off of the going retail price or my wholesale price? How large of a discount should I include for bulk orders? Should I try and price lower to try and acquire more corporate accounts? Any additional feedback or insight is much appreciated.",1,1743463603.0,smallbusiness,5,1.0,False

It's explained to me that Indians drink water by pouring liquid (like water) from cup directly to their open mouth, rather than sipping on the cup. Their cups are usually shared, and for purity rules (and I guess nowadays hygiene), everyone drink with open mouth.

The comments in the blog post are people either arguing about the drinking method is casteism to not share saliva with lower caste, which I guess could be true, or as with everything, kinda vague? My friend doesn't really think that much because it's what everyone does. And there are many ""purity rules"" or I call it spiritual clean-freak.

But specific to the drinking water out of a cup with open mouth, especially with high priest doing it too, see [Why dont they touch their lips to the cup?](https://www.reddit.com/r/exHareKrishna/comments/1f74nvn/why_dont_they_touch_their_lips_to_the_cup/), how much of it is actually casteism? What's the history of it like? Because many cultures around the world don't do the same thing even when sharing cups (not to the same extent, it's perfectly fine where I grew up to just use different edges, and while some people may drink with open mouth, it's not a ""rule"").

I discovered these books in late 2020 because of Brené Brown's podcast (she used  her love of Cuckoo's calling in an ad for Audible - I also, ahem, pronounce it ""coucou"") and I've been addicted ever since. It filled the void after having finally visited the Potterverse with my kids (I was already in my 20s when they came out) and listened to the audibooks on repeat between 2018 and 2020. So for the past 4.5 years I have been listening to the Ellacott & Strike series (sorry Cormoran, Robin is the main protagonist for me) on repeat. I spent much of that time alone in this world until I discovered this sub and TSEF. So thank you for helping me make sense of what has been inhabiting me.

I love the Canes, have seen a lot of posts about pollen and even photos of players who seem to be dealing with allergies. Not just on the Hurricanes but also on the minor league teams in the area.

One antidote that has worked for me for years is buying local honey and taking a teaspoon of it a day, using it in my coffee, tea, and other stuff as a sweetener. I hike a lot while doing photography, so allergies can make my life miserable at this time of year. I've got 3 Jars right now of honey from 3 different parts of the state. Idk the science behind it, but my allegies used to be terrible before I started doing this - it supposedly helps your body get used to dealing with the pollen. All I know is, now I don't have a problem with allergies. I get honey in Spring and in Fall, because that's when my allergies are worst.

 27 M.

Symptoms since then have been throat clearing (which has gotten a little better), but current ones are coughing mucus once or twice after medium sized meals, dry throat, throat dryness and pain after talking for short periods of time. Also recently feeling like some food is totally going down when swallowing - hard to tell if it’s actually getting stuck or just feels like it. 

I have been off coffee, booze, spicy and acidic food, fried food and chocolate. I’ve been taking ppis for four weeks now, and reflux raft before bed. Yet I still have symptoms. Looking for any advice or stories to give me some hope ! Please ! ",2,1743462748.0,GERD,3,1.0,False

Also today i had an interview after that, and when i said my level of English was on a native level (a requirement for the job) as i've lived abroad some year outside of Spain (and i have the required title to prove it) the recruiter an old man snickered, i remained polite and offered to continue the interview in English to prove it but he refused looking annoyed... i don't think they will call me, i hope so as I'm a good programmer and graphic designer. I'm even applying to butcher and supermarket jobs, if i dont get a job by the end of the year i might just join the army and done as I'm getting fit just in case (im just normal body) with some luck they will require programmers.

Anyways, she was 3 years looking for a job and i didn't say anything to her (i also did the chores then though she cooked her own food back then), now i've been unemployed 2 months and she can't stop feeling superior or looking down on me... 🙄, like i left the pots soaking while i was eating as she ate first (i cooked first her food and then mine as i don't like spicy food), and she yelled at me to get them clean now (my wife has a very bad temper the more hungry she is). If your wife is like mine and she looks annoyed just make or order her favourite food.
Anyway at night i had to give her a massage cause she was tired and apply vicks on her chest cause she has congestion so she can breathe better, and after that she just told ""ok now let me sleep"".

It also annoys me a lot she never carries keys to the house as she's afraid to drop them, so if she arrives early or late i have to be ready to get her call or to the ringing bell to open the door for her.
Also i was singing while folding the clothes on the morning and she only told me ""What stupidity you are doing instead of looking for a job"", I'm a very patient and calm person but thats just ruining my mood for no reason for the rsst of the day.

Disclaimer: I love her and she loves me, I'm just venting cause I'm specially annoyed today. We have been more than 10 years together and im used to her nasty temper, usually she apologizes if i look too annoyed, shes 6 months older than me but im taller and she looks younger. we are on our 30's.",1,1743462644.0,Vent,1,0.67,False

Spotted: B claiming she woke up at 5 a.m. on a Sunday to “work” at a donut shop.

Sure, B. And we’re all just extras in your low-budget relatability reboot.
No timestamp. No crusty-eyed selfie. No #IWokeUpLikeThis moment? Please.
If B actually woke up at 5 a.m., there’d be a full BTS reel, mood board, and Spotify playlist to prove it.

Not even a blurry shot of the sunrise and an iced coffee?

At this point you’d show us a pap smear if it made you seem more relatable.

Be serious. If B actually woke up at 5 a.m., the entire feed would’ve known about it before she got out of bed—she woke up in a production trailer with a ring light, a glam squad, and a team of handlers reminding her which brand she’s pretending to care about today.

This isn’t a woman who suffers silently—this is a woman who would post herself blinking if it scored relatability points.

Let’s be honest: B’s not working the counter.
She’s working the narrative.
And the more she fakes “real,” the more it reeks of spin.

Blake doesn’t do real. She does rehearsed.
From her “perfect marriage” to this donut shop cosplay, it’s all curated chaos—one staged crumb at a time.

So no, we’re not buying it.
Because the only thing more fake than that shift… is the smile behind it.

1joh16d,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriott/comments/1joh16d/a_trip_gone_right_st_regis_florence/,A Trip Gone Right - St. Regis Florence,"Recently returned from our 10 year anniversary trip to Italy. 

5 Nights - St Regis Florence

3 Nights - Park Hyatt Milan

As a Titanium / Globalist, over the last year or so I've definitely been feeling the lack of benefits in the United States. StR Florence was on a cash rate and PH Milan was on points w/ a pre-confirmed suite upgrade. I definitely went into the trip expecting to be much more wowed by the PH.

Some background: Originally we were going to stay at Grand Universe Lucca 2 nights first then go to the StR, but we transitioned to the StR for all 5 nights instead. I thus had two bookings (2+3) for the same room (Premium River View). 

I applied NUA's to each reservation separately. I've gotten used to NUA's being mostly irrelevant, so was quite surprised to see the first 2 clear at max window - we were in a Deluxe River View Suite. The next three did not clear and were denied, which I was a bit bummed about.

Until I got to the StR. They had pre-upgraded me into the same room for the remaining three nights. So I got the upgrade and got to keep the 3 NUA's. And since I was on two bookings, they gave me two $100 property credits (one for each). 

The breakfast was excellent. The rooms was amazing. The service was exemplary.

I talked to the front desk at one point and we were chatting about European history. She had a hardcover book about the hotel and its history delivered by the butler along with morning coffee. (The building was originally designed by Brunelleschi and has quite a fascinating history and guest list). 

Nice turndown treats. Excellent service. Always had our car brought around very fast. The bar is beautiful, and the cafe is decked out in Ginori and quite lovely. Had a great massage at the spa. 

Overall just a really excellent experience and once where I felt having Bonvoy status actually did matter.

PH Milan was fine. By contrast much colder and less extra touches. (Though the on-site restaurant was better and I do really appreciate free parking on award stays w/ Hyatt). ",5,1743462518.0,marriott,2,0.78,False

1joh040,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1joh040/the_tears_that_transcend/,The Tears That Transcend,"The moment I became a firm believer in karma was when my beloved cowboy boots gave up on me—and my right ankle gave out with them—right in the middle of Soho.

We’d just wrapped dinner at our favourite Chinatown spot, high on shredded spicy potato and mapo tofu. I was mid-debrief, telling him about the lunch I’d had with a girl we used to go to school with. “She was asking me the weirdest questions… Do I look like I know anything about the economy?” I said. To be fair, she was really sweet—just not well-versed in basic lunch etiquette, I guess.

We decided to take a post-dinner stroll, and that’s when karma knocked. Hard. One second I was mid-sentence, the next, something in my ankle snapped—like the ligaments had just clocked out. Pain shot up my leg, sharp and fast, leaving me breathless, clutching the bargain, pristine-condition cowboy boots I’d found in Notting Hill.

There are two types of injuries in this world. There’s the papercut kind—the ones that sting like hell in the moment but quietly fade as the day goes on, so by the time you’re doing your skincare at night, you’re not wincing when the toner hits.

Then there’s the type where you experience a moment of silence and go, “Damn, this is going to sting for a while.” In this case, it was when I woke up at 4 a.m. from the throbbing in my ankle and looked up at my poorly elevated leg.

I fear it’s always the second type of injury—the long ones, the ones that need to be nurtured and given time to heal—that we’re so often tasked with.

Growing up and growing pains go hand in hand. And I hate it. I love the freedom of sipping martinis with my girlfriends every weekend, but why do I also have to report to HMRC every year? How am I supposed to keep track of every Uber I take during fashion month? 

I cried on the phone with my accountant last year.

“You’re not in trouble,” he said gently. “A lot of people forget to pay their taxes when they first start working.”

I seem to be crying more than usual recently. Just last week, I was sitting at my desk, quietly noticing that I felt overwhelmed. I spent the rest of the evening searching “videos to cry to” on TikTok, but nothing seemed to do the trick.

I was craving the kind of cry that leaves you empty—the kind that feels like a weight has been lifted. The tears that transcend you. The ones that signal the end of a chapter: when you’re still holding on to the comfort of what you’ve known, while shakily taking dreaded steps into something new.

Full of grief. Full of change. And allowing it to sting for a while.

I’m no stranger to grief—it’s my favourite sweater to wear. Only because I’ve been through it enough times to know that the version of myself who steps into the light on the other side is full of life, love, and the energy to take on—and fully embrace—whatever comes next.

But when you’re in the thick of it, it feels like your heart has shut down. Every tear reminds me that my reality has shifted. That things are changing—and that I have no control over it.

A tear for the last family vacation we took—a short trip to Hong Kong after my brother and I had been to Japan. Our parents met us there. A tear for New Year’s Eve this year, when I toasted to the new year with my parents by the beach, not knowing it might be the last time we’d all be under the same roof. A tear for every argument I heard through the walls. And many more tears for the little girl inside me—the one who still fantasised about happy parents.

It feels silly to be crying about my parents’ divorce. The clock shows I’m about to turn 26 in 30 minutes.

For some reason, I didn’t think it would affect me. I’m an adult. There’s no custody battle, no messy logistics—I haven’t lived under the same roof as them in eight years.

It’s a sigh of relief, too. No more getting caught in the middle of their fights. No more hearing each parent talk shit about the other.

But once the noise of their marriage faded, it was the absence of the mundane that started to speak the loudest.

No more barging into my mum’s room in the morning to watch her do her aerobics routine while I lounged on her bed. No more popping out for coffee at the café next door.

Because when I go home in two weeks, she won’t be in his house anymore.

Grief is the kind of injury that arrives unannounced—snapping in the blink of an eye and leaving you with the rubble. It’s part of growing pains: inevitable, valuable, and gut-wrenchingly painful. 

Grief also has the power to break your mould—offering you the chance to rise up and begin navigating a new reality. To grow and evolve, isn’t that what life’s about anyways?

I look down at my right ankle now, fully healed.

They started talking about how it is so healthy to put butter, ghee, coconut oil, etc. in your coffee and all the health benefits of doing so. This isn't the worst wellness trend out there this year, but it's about feeling like everything you consume has to have nutritional benefits.

The conversation continued with a rant on seed oils. The other stylist said her client needed to throw out any canola and vegetable oil. Ugh... 

I wanted to say so much, but I kept my mouth shut. I felt so out of control and wanting to leave the situation. After having an ED for a long time, I have no tolerance anymore for people perpetuating diet culture and leading others to believe things that have no basis in fact/science.

What frustrated me more was I told my mom about how I felt afterwards and she said she didn't understand why I was so angry and upset by it. I am because it's actively harming other people hearing it and they said they got their information from ""a podcast,"" which probably is full of BS nutrition information.

Does anyone else get up in arms when you hear this kind of talk around you? Please make me feel like I'm not crazy in being angry about this kind of nonsense continuing to cycle.

Does anyone relate?,"I have now been on Adderall (generic Elite) for about a month or so now, and I feel like it’s so inconsistent. I started off with 20mg XR (Mallinckrodt mfg) and I hated the XR because it gave me insomnia and the worse headaches. Switched over to 15mg IR as a trial, and now officially on 20mg IR twice a day. I feel some days it works as it should, and others I find myself taking an extra half to make it through work. The only thing I don’t understand is that I only feel that true level of focus/productivity/awareness during the first 2 hours in the morning.

I usually take my first dose in the morning about the time I start work at 730a, on an empty stomach with 1 cup of coffee. I struggle to eat something solid after because of course I’m really not hungry once the meds have kicked in, and I end up having a bite or 2 of whatever I made myself. I have tried several times eating breakfast first, waiting an hour, then taking my adderall, but then i feel it doesn’t work as well and I find myself wanting to sleep or doom scroll on my phone. It takes awhile for me to get going, but eventually I’ll feel productive, but again, only for a short 2 hour window. I thought my dose still may be too low. And why is it that the 2nd dose feels nearly non-existent? I usually take my 2nd dose at 1-2pm and I feel irritable and anxious most of the afternoon. I am a mom of a 3 yr old and 1 yr old and I hate to see my patience wear thin with them around this time. 

Also as a female, has anyone felt that your adderall absolutely does almost nothing during your menstrual cycle? I would say about 3 days before my period, and then while on my period, I feel absolutely nothing from the medication. If anything I feel it makes me more angry and I still can easily sleep on my medication. I tried explaining this to my telehealth doctor and he claimed to never have heard of other women talking about this issue, but I’ve read multiple people online encounter the same issue. I have tried asking for an increased dose that way when it is that time of month I can bump up my dosage a bit. I have even found myself taking an extra half a pill, or sometimes whole pill extra in the day just to get through my work tasks. But he didn’t want to bump me up because he felt that I was at a good dosage and it may have been too soon for me to increase. 

I also find that on days I don’t need to take my Adderall because it’s the weekend, I wanna enjoy eating and just kinda take it easy, the way my body feels like I did a marathon everyday during the week. It’s like a severe crash after the week of being on the meds, I  feel I wanna just nap, struggle getting out of bed, doing things with my kids, and my brain feels extremely foggy.
