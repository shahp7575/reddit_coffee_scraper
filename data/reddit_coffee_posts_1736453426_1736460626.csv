We’ve went on 3 dates.**



1st date: coffee

2nd date: appetizers and movie



\*between the 2nd and 3rd date he **randomly was drunk texting me** one night. sending me song lyrics.\*



3rd date: movie at his place (He suggested going out for dinner but i was more comfortable at home).



While we were cuddling, he mentioned he has a baby face. I said in a baby voice “oh youre so cute, i love your baby face”. He chuckled and told me to **STFU.**



After the movie  we attempted to have s\*x but he was experiencing a lot of pain because he has phimosis so we werent able to.



As I was leaving, he hugged me tight, I playfully said “youre strong, lets see how tightly you can hug me”. He proceeded to hug me tightly, I let out a little scream and he again told me to **STFU**. (He lives in an apartment so I understood but still felt it was a bit rude).



ANyways, He was very embarassed about failure to have intercourse but i reassured him that its okay. He said he needed time to think.  



After 2 days of no contact, I reached out, He said he has genuine feelings for me and would like to figure out the physical intimacy obstacle together. He said hes been imagining getting **married to me, having kids**, but he wants to take it slow because hes nevver been in love before and its a big decision for him and his family. He also mentioned that there are a few things he would like to discuss in person which may be dealbreakers. 



I proceeded to ask him if theres anything he doesnt like about me. He replied by saying that his new years resolution is to get fit/eat healthy/gym and he said **he wants me to have the same resolution** since its easier to be accountable to a partner. I felt kind of weird about this, but agreed. We are both on the heavier/curvier side but i felt like this was an odd thing to suggest to someone who ive only met 3 times.





We continued texting and playing 21 questions. I asked him what gives him the ‘**Ick’.** He said tickling. (I was tickling him the other day while watching the movie so this was odd to me).  When we had been watching a movie the day before, the movie had a character who was a gay male who married a straight woman to protect his image in society. He told me that this is termed as being a DUFF. While playing 21 questions he asked me “Are you okay with me being a **Duff**?” I clarified and asked him “Are you asking me if I’d be okay with you being a duff AKA a **gay** man who gets married to protect his image?” He said yes. I found that kind of odd. I said Id like honesty from you. Then we continued asking eachother random questions. 



I was feeling off about the whole situation, and honestly, I dont really feel a spark with him. So i texted him saying “ Hey  I don’t see this working out long term. You’re a great person and I wish you all the best. “



He kept probing and wanting more info so I told him about my concerns above. He said he was joking, he can change, and saying that he was just starting to fall in love with me, and that this is a stupid reason to end a relationship over. I clarified and told him that we are not yet in a relationship. He was super upset and was blowing up my phone with messages. he said “You told me you don’t like the stfu thing I said. I will change. I will learn, like we said it’s a learning process I’m trying out communication I can work to do better … Such potential, such greatness and happiness and good in the world could have happened, and ending all of it completely over something that could have been worked on and improved on together, just seems crazy.Maybe I was wrong about how I thought you felt about meBut that’s how I felt about you. I felt we were mutually starting to fall in love.”



This whole situation has made me feel very tense and uneasy. I feel guilty because im an empath and dont want to hurt someone. Hes genuinely a very nice person but I dont feel that spark or romantic connection with him. I also feel like hes not emotionally stable if hes become so attached to me so fast. We usually go 24-36 hours without texting/meeting, so I didnt realize how attached hes getting to me. Is he lovebombing me or manipulating me? Am I the red flag? Is it just that we’re incompatible? 



Even if i was willing to give it another shot, Im a bit afraid to now. What if he blows up again like this if we decide to end things later on? 



Please give me advice.

1hxoon7,https://i.redd.it/vkwkz7ugk1ce1.jpeg,All the Sorce scents I’ve sniffed!,"Ok warning some of the ratings are rambly/nonsense, it’s just how my brain ticks I’m sorry! But here goes! 

Match Made In Heaven: 9/10 soft, light vanilla, sweetened matcha powder and a hint of cones being baked in the background. Lovely cherry blossom in the background that stops this from being one of her ultra sweets 

Fuckery: 8/10 I love this for a special occasion/going out for date night or to the bar with friends, it’s a late night fragrance for me. It’s smoky black cherry and whiskey 

Where the Wild Things Grow: 7/10 super ripe strawberries and fresh cut grass, the notes are pretty straight forward and it reminds me of early summer and childhood nostalgia 

Snow Moon Magic: 10/10 sweet spices, cookie butter, very light lavender and fluffy marshmallows. #1 fragrance of 2024 

Moon Magic: 9/10: SMM ‘s spicier, lavender-ier sister. It starts with a strong hit of cinnamon, almost craft fair cinnamon. But it dries down to a spicy sweet chai tea with lavender 

Falling Stars: 6/10 (orange cardamom and brown sugar) this smells like a chocolate orange and fresh cup of black coffee. It’s so chocolate orange to me that it reminds me of Christmas and is struggle to wear it casually. I did however wear it on Christmas and my partner loved it! (He got 4 chocolate oranges in his stocking so he can snack on them year round) 

The Cookie Party: 7/10 this starts out with a weirdly glue-ish scent when I first spray it, but it goes away quickly and dries down to buttery/coconutty/vanilla scent. 

2am in Lafayette: 10/10 This one is constantly arm wrestling SMM to get into my top spot. The caramel and beignets make this so rich and sweet, the cafe au lait note has a toasty black coffee note with the creamy milk that’s so smooth, and the oakmoss stops it from being overly sweet, and the woodiness blends in beautifully. This is actually a love poem for 2am in Lafayette. 

She’s a Witch: 8/10 the star anise is very present in this for the first hour or two, and then it fades into soft powdery baked goods with a light warm muskiness. The anise is always there but it fades to the background. It doesn’t say it in the notes but I almost get an almondy note in there, which I really love. This perfume makes me pine for an almond forward scent from Sorce cause I know Caitlyn would nail it. (unless there is one that I’ve missed? Lmk if there is an almond forward Sorce scent cause I need it)

English Major 6/10 The inkiness has a sharpness to it and the decalepis hamiltonii absolute is a totally new to me scent and it’s very earthy which is a note I struggle with. The soft marshmallow note was nice and the perfume overallhad a soft powdery-ness to it along with the sharpness of the earthy/inky notes. 

Sit for a Spell 9/10 my summertime sweetheart. This is so juicy, and a little spicy from the rosemary, and sticky sweet from the honey and cantaloupe. 

String of Lights in the Forest 6/10 this is nice, but it’s a little musky for me. The beeswax is pretty strong, and the vanilla milkshake is more of a background character than I’d like it to be. The lavender is really lovely though, it’s a very natural/herby lavender 

Cabanilla 7/10 This is a smoky beachy vanilla coconut, it’s a lot less sweet/gourmand than Sorce’s other perfumes and I think this is perfect for the heat of summer

Serpentine 9/10 This reminds me so much of Fuckery, it’s a rich, spicy and sweet scent that draws me in. The fig is sweet but not overbearing, and the woody honied scent is interesting and addicting. I just want to keep sniffing myself when I wear this. It’s a wonderful blend of sexy and still sweet, and that’s what I aim to be. 

The Ghost Wants Birthday Cake: 9/10 the sandalwood and peach both hit me right in the face with this one, and they both play so nicely together! I love love this for late summer and early fall. It almost smells like a big glass of freshly brewed black tea with a little spice and peach syrup 

This is Not a Love Spell: 5/10 This isn’t for me but it’s lovely. The blueberry and violet are heavy in this and blueberry doesn’t mesh well with me, and while it smells lovely when I first spray it/catch the scent in the air I just don’t love it once it’s dried down on me. The violet comes through to powdery and almost dusty on me. 
(Side note: my brain smells this and immediately associates it with Precious Moments. If someone can help me figure out why my brain thinks of tiny sad bibilical figurines i’d really appreciate it! I’m thinking they did something scented that brings this memory to me? Idk)

A Sign Painted Peaches: 8/10 sweet syrupy/juicy/sticky delicious peach with bright and floral gardenia. I’m not usually a floral girl but the way this tones down the sweetness and of the peach and blends so nicely, it’s just magic. I love this for the heat of summer. To me it’s a late July, sunshiny morning at the farmers market with ripe peaches and fresh cut flowers. 

Dark Skies: 6.5/10 this was such a surprise to my nose, I expected this to be an earthy, herbaly smell but it has a strong blast of powdered candy to my nose? Like, pixie sticks almost? I don’t know if my nose is broken but I’ve returned to it a few times since receiving it in June and I always get the same blast of sweet citrus sugar dust. I can’t even find a note in this perfume that would make it make sense to my brain but, the nose smells what it smells 🤷🏻‍♀️ and I love what it smells so I’m ok with it. 

The Things Unsaid: 8/10 I don’t know how else to describe this besides cold and clean. It reminds me of fresh flowers brought in from the cold rain. Like putting on a clean white cotton shirt when you’re fresh out of the bath on a cold early spring morning. 

Stuck On You: 7/10 green apple and sticky caramel through and through. This one is simple and to the point and I really enjoy the tartness of the apple with the warm sweetness of the caramel

Something Wicked: 4/10 This is what really sealed the deal that I don’t like patchouli. Man I wish I liked patchouli. I just don’t. The vanilla in this smells warm and boozy and then the nose itching stank of patchouli hits me. I can’t do it.

UFO Disco: 5/10 this smells like creamy mangos and cilantro, I’m sorry I don’t make the rules for my nose. It’s got a sharp greenness to it that blends in with the creamy mango and I like it while I’m sniffing the bottle, but I don’t enjoy it on me. Something in the note that feels cilantro-y to me goes a bit, twangy on me. Almost like a sharp body odor note which is such a bummer because in the bottle it’s so interesting and slightly refreshing, and then on me it just. Doesn’t. 

Cake For Breakfast: 8/10 a hot pot of black coffee, pineapple upside down cake, and a drizzle of maple syrup. She’s simple and delicious and reminds me of a diner breakfast with a fancy stack of pineapple pancakes.

1hxok7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hxok7f/24m_my_girlfriend_24f_is_going_through_a_tough/,"[24/M] my girlfriend [24/F] is going through a tough time, but every time it happens, I end up taking the hit. What should I do?","My GF and I have been together for four years now. She is currently a student at university, and I finished my degree and started working. We've lived together for two years now, adopted a cat, and so far so good.

The first disagreements in our relationship started when we moved in together, regarding how messy the place had gotten sometimes. I know I'm not the most tidy, but I'm not THAT scattered, and it seems like she doesn't care. She does most of the cooking and the cleaning (which frankly I suck at, so I'd rather her do it), but I do other chores around the house. We split the bills so that's not much of an issue.

The persistent mess and other things in our daily lives resulted in a snowballing of emotions, that spiraled this year to levels way beyond what we've been used to. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells every time I tell her about something she's misplaced (and she does, a lot. I really don't want to see half-full cups of coffee on every counter in the apartment), or threw, or did something - and when she does let me know about something, I try to do it the best I can. 

Sometimes she gets incredibly upset about the most minor issues (like when I ask her to put away stuff), and then she goes full-out passive aggressive and straight up unbearable. I can't not take that personally and it feels like she's punishing me just for the sake of being me when she's in the mood for it - and I don't care that she'd usually come later and apologize, which happens often. I swore to not have a relationship like my parents have, so I actually like talking about what bothers me and how it can be solved (together. I don't lecture her), but she seems like it just doesn't matter to her. She has closed up lately, and I only know the general feelings she has, and never elaborated on anything more, even before that. I'm not the most open person myself, but I try to make an effort to let her know how I feel.

I have been through an incredibly rough time in my personal life lately, and she has as well. She overworks herself with university work, and honestly, I don't know if what she picked is good for her, but if I tell her that she'd think I don't believe in her (I really do, but her parents never did, and she does need support), and then go full on passive-aggressive no talking again. 

When she is angry though, she is angry. She gets incredibly aggressive and defensive, even pushes me at times, and I find it torturing even. I've experienced passive aggression and borderline abusive behavior when I was younger, with being bullied and ostracized as a teen, so the wounds are still fresh and I still black out every time this happens. I can't do anything the hours after when these ""episodes"" hit and it makes me feel like shit obviously.

More things happened lately, and an honorable mention is when I had to sleep at my parents' house to watch over their cats while they were away, she stayed at home, and suddenly a rat jumped inside the kitchen. Instead of doing anything to it she just closed herself in her room and called me (I had my phone on mute), and when I went back home to try and solve the situation the day after, she went to her parents for a few days and went super low contact. I felt like I was punished (again) for something I wasn't responsible for, and when she came back she still acted super off and reserved. For example, she promised she'd help me clean off the kitchen with bleach (as we should have), but was incredibly reluctant to do it because she was busy (the excuse she uses the most nowadays to avoid literally everything) and because she didn't trust me for scaring off the rat (which I have). So yeah

We had a big fight two days ago, which resulted in me almost crying and then her crying and apologizing. I told her that it's either we go to couples therapy or split because I genuinely can't bear with this shitty behavior every time she feels a bit off. I sent her links to couples therapists, but she dismissed them because ""they had no reviews"" (we don't have an elaborate review rating system for these. they're signed with the government and I've read some reviews when they do have them, which is why she got these links). She left the house incredibly messy, with plates all over, clothes thrown around everywhere, and like always.

So today. We were supposed to celebrate our 4th anniversary, and I booked us a place at a nice restaurant to celebrate. She came home incredibly stressed and went straight into the work room. She came up to me, gave me flowers and then asked me why I looked that angry (she ignored my calls before and when I asked her where she was she answered super vaguely). Turns out she wanted to surprise me with a picture frame collage of us, but because the bus driver back home accidentally closed the door on her while she was walking out, the frame broke, to which she reacted with smashing it on the floor from anger. She then came up to me (a few minutes before we were supposed to leave) and told me she didn't want to go because her plans didn't work. I told her it doesn't matter at all and that today is my treat, and all she needs to do is to enjoy the night. 

We got to the bus stop, and I asked her how her day was. She started freaking out again and elbowed me because she said I ""forced her"" to talk about something she didn't want to (yet she brought it up). I asked her what the fuck that was all about, and whether she is punishing me again for some reason (she was passive aggressive up until that point), and then she stormed off the bus station literally two minutes before it was supposed to show up. I told her she doesn't have the keys to the apartment (only I had them on me) and as an answer she gave me the middle finger and stormed off. I felt like shit again, contemplated going by myself but then went back home. She came back a few minutes later and closed herself in our bedroom.

I'm at loss, to be honest. When she's Dr. Jekyll, she's one of the sweetest, most caring, and nice people I know - but when Mr. Hyde comes I am literally scared to have anything to do with her. What should I even do at this point? I am willing to pay for therapy for her or something, because she wouldn't talk to me elaborately about anything. I love her with all my heart, but I'm honestly super super SUPER SUPER tired with everything this brings. What can I do? What should I do? I'd obviously want to fix the whole situation and make her actually TALK about things and SHARE but I really cannot stand this type of behavior anymore. 



Please ask anything related to this in the comments if I wasn't clear enough. Also, I apologize for my English.



TLDR: My \[24M\] GF \[24F\] had an ""anger episode"" today when we were supposed to go and celebrate our anniversary. We've been arguing more frequently and harder than we are used to due to hard times for the both of us, and aside for me not being able to cope with it well, I feel like absolute shit for existing, and truly at loss with my options.",1,1736460140.0,relationships,1,1.0,False
1hxoioe,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/1hxoioe/any_ideas_on_what_this_could_be/,Any ideas on what this could be?,"I already have sleep apnea and the symptom I am about to describe kind of sort of used to happen before my diagnosis but it used to take 2-3 hours before it'd hit me.

Before diagnosis (2019 and before),

I would wake up to my alarm, drink coffee, go to work (at home) and I would crash hard 2-3 hours later. Pass out for 30 minutes and feel fine.

After diagnosis (2020),  
Initially with my CPAP, I had less issues, I could stay away all day, no more crashing.

Now since 2021, If something wakes me up in the morning like an alarm, a person or my dog, I need to go back to sleep and wake up on my own, otherwise I am out of it mentally, like I never woke up. Coffee helps a little but I can feel it in my eyes. Eventually it catches up and I need to go lay down. However, if I don't get up and just go back to sleep and wake up on my own when I feel rested I am usually good to go. If I close my eyes and lay down and get in a period (15-30 minutes) where I feel like I am dreaming (feels like day dream as I am not fully asleep and my subconscience takes over), I can generally recover and go about my day

Right now the most consistent data point is I'm somewhere in the 9 hours of sleep range when I feel best (not great, but my best), less than that typically sucks. If I wake up during a dream, it's a complete disaster until I go back to sleep ( I used to oversleep a lot as a kid and recall this kind of happening then too).

I have HCM (Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy) so I am sure it has an affect on me but not sure if its the main source of this issue.

Just wondering if anyone else has dealt with something similar or not? I know I need to get in touch with a sleep doctor but I just moved back to the U.S. and don't have insurance quite yet",1,1736460036.0,SleepApnea,3,1.0,False

1hxoej8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CSFLeaks/comments/1hxoej8/no_results_on_cisternogram/,No results on cisternogram,"People wanted updates, so here they are. With the cisternogram: in short, some indications of a leak on the first day, no indications on the second day. Also, my symptoms seem to have improved somewhat?

# Cisternogram
Lumbar puncture was a bit painful, but really not too bad. On the first day they took one picture about 2 hours after the injection, and (according to them, this is promising) saw that my various organs were lighting up. This got me kind of excited. I checked with my doctor, and he said it would be ok for me to sit up extra to try and highlight the leak, so I did that. Unfortunately, on day 2, it looked like the CSF had fully dissipated and there was no indication of the leak. 

# Home remedy adjacent stuff
There's been some moderately exciting news though. I keep a spreadsheet of my symptoms, with potentially relevant daily info. After using the abdominal binders, I noticed that there was some slight improvement in my symptoms even without using the binder. This was really exciting, because my symptoms had previously been slowly deteriorating, and this inspired me to read a little more literature + try a few things. I started keeping a spreadsheet and being more deliberate with my actions. Here is what I tried:

* **Reducing** caffeine intake: Since caffeine can almost double the production of [CSF fluid](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2744679/), I would expect it to relieve symptoms but slow down healing due to increased flow out of the leak.^1 Admittedly the first day without caffeine was really really tough, but after that it got much easier.

* Kept electrolyte+sugar consumption unchanged. Best not to introduce too many variables.

* (warning: woo-woo shit) Auto-hypnosis: Unfortunately the only real, recent clinical trial I could find was about burn victims and similar, but results were very statistically significant. I'm typically pretty opposed to vague woo-woo shit, but it wouldn't shock me if there was some moderately altered state that allowed us to increase/reduce blood flow to random parts of our body. The first step of healing is inflammation, so I figured this could make a difference. I've been doing this once a day for about 30 minutes, I've successfully gotten myself into a sleep-paralysis like state twice and then I tried to direct blood-flow towards my back.

^1: This is not supported by any literature and just conjecture on my part. I couldn't find studies indicating the effects of long-term caffeine consumption on CSF healing specifically. I would imagine this is a hard study to do, so this isn't too surprising. There are lots of caffeine/CSF studies, but none that I was looking for.

# Changes in condition
And now for the end results: I have actually seen, once again, huge improvements to my condition! During the day of my cisternogram, I got something like 6 hours of upright time, two days in a row, with only light-moderate pain in the last two hours. This is without using my abdominal binder, painkillers, or coffee!!! For reference, even two weeks ago, it was maybe like 30 minutes with the binder and caffeine. 

Unfortunately, the day after is definitely pretty crappy, but I did also have the lumbar puncture so I'm not taking it too personally. Going forward, I will continue this testing. After the last few days, I have real hope this thing can heal even before they finally get around to fucking treating me. But we will see.

Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, just some random grad student. What works for me may hurt you, depending on your situation. For the love of god check with a doctor before you try stuff, especially the 'spicier' things. I asked about abdominal binders and about standing up extra for the study. I do these experiments at my own risk, and this is explicitly *not* medical advice. Happy to hear any and all feedback, as long as it's thorough.",2,1736459739.0,CSFLeaks,2,1.0,False

Tales of Marlow

# I: Somewhere Along The Beaver River…



*“We landed near where the Beaver River met the Ohio. Rain fell all that morning and so we bivvied on the shore to wait it out. Deganawida tells me that this land is used as hunting ground for the Indians pushed west and is uninhabited for most of the year. By God, but this wilderness is magnificent. My father never knew its like. I feel that were I to point my feet west and walk on or ride the current down the river I would not reach the end. What, I wonder, would I find?”*



The Byrne Account, April 6, 1750

# Chapter 1: Terra Incognita



Fall, 1764.



The wilderness wore the strange, muted light of predawn. Here, time was etched not by human hands but by the implacable growth of forking branches and the slow burrowing of roots. Deep grooves scarred the mountains, their faces carved by the relentless flow of rivers and streams. A cold breeze whispered through the trees. Wood clacked and dew fell from pine needles like fragrant rain. Plumes of steam rose in geysers from glassy ponds.



The tranquility shattered with a womanish shriek. The stillness of the woods splintered as leaves skittered and crunched under the flight of prey from predator. The thrashing struggle was brief and brutal. It ended with a savage finality and the silence returned, heavier than before as if awaiting further violence.



The dense forest gave way to a barren expanse of churned mud.  Stumps jutted through the mist like broken teeth. Felled trees lay in chaotic heaps, their trunks broken as if a landslide had uprooted and discarded them. At the clearing’s center stood a rough hill of moss-coated timber, still sticky with sap. The construct loomed, as if it were the den of some slumbering thing that at any moment would rouse itself to seek provender.



This is where the settlers of the Barron-Abercrombie Company lived for the first year. 



Each day they rose before the sun from their bedrolls or utilitarian pallets. The smell of stinking, half-cured pelts, unwashed bodies, and flatulence mixed with the wet decay of the woods into a musk that seemed to bear physical weight. Standing around a cookfire, dozens of men grumbled in their native tongues - German, English, smatterings of Scandinavian dialects. Steam and halitosis billowed from their open mouths. They ladled coffee into tin cups and tested creaky bones and stiff muscles, fingered wounds, flexed swollen hands, scratched at chiggers or lice. The vermin that infested the camp were legion. Men spooned bland pottage into their mouths and bit into biscuits infested with insects and their larvae.



“Nutty,” Aldrich Hess said around a mouthful as he looked at the shiny black body burrowed in his hardtack.



“Weevil,” his brother Erich’s smile was a yellowish crescent in the firelight. “Trade?” 

Thus fortified, they gathered their tools and set off into the woods. The day before they selected a monstrous black oak at the edge of a steep hill for harvesting. The trees were prized for their strength and used as masts in English ships, and so they were the first to have the letters BACO branded into their trunks by the Company hired surveyors. Around its base, men stood with hands on hips as they worked out how they would get the job done

“We should guide it to the ground with ropes,” Bruno Meyer suggested.

Einer Vogel winced. “Mice have been at the stores. They seem to have a taste for hemp.” 

“If you have a better notion, feel free to share it with us,” Meyer said. “Without the ropes, it’s liable to end up in the deadfall. What then?”

Vogel wiped a hand over his jaw, then shrugged. “How many ships do the beefeaters truly need?”

“As I thought, ropes it is,” Meyer jerked a thumb over his shoulder. “You can round up the horses, Vogel.”  

It took more than six hours of chopping with axes and sawing with a pair of eight-foot misery whips before the oak had a large wedge taken out of its trunk. Men that had expended themselves with the work were called from their repose to lash its base and tether the lines to other trees and the team of stamping dray horses. 

“Right,” Meyer announced, squinting up at the canopy. “Get the kid up there and let’s bring this big bastard down.”  

At nineteen-years-old, Lars Gearhardt was the youngest of the timbermen. For this, he was almost exclusively referred to as “the kid” by the other men, with varying degrees of derision. He was also often chosen for the least desirable work, which he did without complaint. They ordered him into an adjacent maple to get the lay of the land. He scampered arm over arm until he stood on a branch thirty feet off the ground. 

“What do you see?” Felix Sammet called up to him. Gearhardt chopped his extended arm down twice, indicating the path the falling tree should follow. When all was secure, men hammered iron wedges into the oak and soon they heard the high squeal of protesting lumber. They spat into their palms and held the coarse rope in their fists. At first, the massive trunk leaned in the direction they intended it to, the tethers pulled taut as the weight asserted itself. 

Without warning there was a series of sounds like musket shot as several ropes snapped with small explosions of hemp dust. One of the horses, suddenly free of its burden, galloped off into the woods in a panic, bowling over a pair of its minders. The others bucked and shrieked as the redistribution of weight bore painfully against them. The oak leaned slowly at first, surreally hanging in the air, then rapidly tipped several strides right of its intended path.

“Sheisse!” Someone swore. 

“Cut the horses loose! Cut the damn lines!” Shouted another. 

They managed to spare the horses by severing their tethers with a series of quick axe chops, but others were yanked painfully from the timbermen's hands, tearing flesh or pulling them from their feet. 

Frantic shouts of, “Timber! Timber!” snapped Lars Gearhardt to attention as he stared transfixed at the massive weight of oak that fell towards him. Just before impact, he leapt from the tree he was standing in and onto the branch of another as deftly and surefooted as he might have jumped from stepping stones in a creek. The oak crashed through the maple he had just been occupying, smashing it to kindling and taking two others down with it, before landing so hard it staggered some of the men standing on the ground. Fortunately, aside from a few rope burns and wrenched shoulders, nobody was seriously hurt. When the men saw Gearhardt was likewise uninjured, they began to cheer.

“Mein Gott,"" Aldrich Hess said in wonder, his fingers laced behind his head in disbelief. “I thought we killed the kid!”

“He’s not a kid,” Einer Vogel shouted over the din. “He’s a goddamned mountain goat!”

After that day, he and Lars Gearhardt became fast friends. Einer Vogel was lanky and rawboned, with a large Adam’s Apple and a jaw that was perpetually covered in blue stubble. Lars, meanwhile, looked like a figure straight from a Norse saga – tall and blonde, with a hawkish profile and prodigious vitality. 

At first Vogel fancied himself a sort of mentor to the younger man. It soon became clear, however, that despite his age, Gearhardt had no need of guidance. They made for a strange pair. Vogel was eight years Gearhardt’s senior and yet there was no doubt the younger man was the more disciplined. Vogel had a penchant for drink and Gearhardt was virtually abstinent. Vogel possessed a wry sense of humor that sometimes veered into the caustic, whereas Gearhardt, while not humorless, was more reserved and generally content to observe his friend’s bawdiness rather than partake in it.  

Despite these differences, the two worked well together. As a woodworker and carpenter respectively, when they were not felling trees for the Company they built homes for their neighbors and as a result became popular men. When it came to this task, Vogel invariably deferred to Gearhardt. Where this might have bred resentment in a more fractious man, Vogel had no qualms about welcoming him as a peer.

Bruno Meyer once commented on this, saying, “How can Vogel stand dancing to the tune of that sprat?” 

“My cabin is dry as a bone and tighter than a drum,” Felix Sammet replied. “Whatever tune that boy plays, I am tempted to dance to it myself.”



**::**



The industrious settlers worked together to solve the endless array of challenges they faced as befitted their skill set. The trees were cleared, the ground leveled, and soon if looked upon with the right eyes one could see the outline of the village that, God willing, would one day stand. By spring of 1766, the men began to send away for their families. The initial caravan used the Braddock Road, which was cut during the French and Indian War by troops of militia and British regulars led by General Braddock’s tall, redheaded, twenty-three-year-old colonel, a Virginian named George Washington. The first settlers cleared the overgrown road on their journey west in anticipation of future migrations, but the way was no less difficult and indeed more so as the new parties contained many women, young children, and unruly livestock. 



Frieda Gearhardt was pretty after a severe fashion, with blonde hair tied into a thick braid, a wide jaw that naturally pulled her lips into a slight frown, and hard blue eyes. She struck those that met her as dignified if they were being charitable and imperious if they were not. Many found her unapproachable for these reasons, and for the first days of the migration she walked alone. 



But then one day as she was preparing supper, Frieda began to sing, and despite the perceptions of her, the song was warm and beautiful. Her rich alto whisked the weary travelers to alpine vistas or summer days on the Rhine. So engrossed was she in her work that she did not notice the small crowd that gathered to listen. In contrast to the sweet song, with the bang of a cleaver she lopped the head off the chicken intended for her pot. As the bloody fowl convulsed in her hands, a splutter of unfettered laughter from the crowd brought her back to reality. 



“Singing like that while cutting a chicken’s head off,” a woman with mousy brown hair and a weak chin said. “Maybe I should be worried, but I think instead I shall invite you to dine with us tonight,” she extended her hand. “I am Leena Vogel.”   



That night, they ate Frieda’s chicken soup and Leena’s bread with the young Vogel children, Alice and Rudi. Leena was jocular in a way Frieda was unaccustomed to in a woman, and when she smiled she revealed a set of endearingly crooked front teeth. More than her humor, however, Frieda loved the patient strength she displayed with her children. 



Once, as they roughhoused, the toddler Rudi ran into a low branch. It smacked his head with an audible clack and he sat down hard on the ground. He looked at the women, his eyes wide with more fear than hurt and verging on tears. Frieda hurried to her feet to comfort the boy, but Leena snorted a laugh and waved her down.



“Rudi, you are fine,” she said. “Remember to duck next time.”



The boy looked at the adults uncertainly. Then, seeing his mother’s confidence that the blow was not mortal, decided that he was fine after all, and scrambled to his feet to continue the game with his sister. Frieda laughed as if she had just witnessed a magic trick. 



“You’ll worry your teeth out if every stumble sends you running,” Leena said around the darning needle she held in her mouth, then looked down to the set of trousers she was mending. “You’ll learn that lesson when you have a few brats of your own.” She did not see the smile fade from Frieda’s face.



The road was hard, but the women found comfort and fidelity in one another. Alice worshiped Frieda like a beloved older sister while little Rudi’s infatuation was as earnest as only a child’s love could be. Leena teased Frieda about her ""devoted suitor,"" eliciting smiles that with greater frequency softened her stern features. The miles fell away and soon they arrived in Fort Pitt, the last bastion of civilization, such as it was. 



There they stayed the night, during which the rough men stationed at the fort made lewd overtures towards the uncommon influx of women. One hard bitten trapper even went so far as to pull the teenage Verna Schmidt onto his lap as the women passed through the public house. Things might have escalated further if not for Bolga Schlesinger, a stout butcher’s wife from Heidelberg. She stormed across the room and twisted the trapper’s ear until he squealed in pain, allowing the humiliated girl to flee. Schlesinger then marched the man to the door, ear still clenched in her fingers, and tossed him into the muddy street. 



She turned back to the stunned men in the room, her face brick red, and announced in a voice that rattled the walls, “My four year old son is better behaved than you lot! Next time I hear so much as an unkind word spoken to these girls, it won’t be your ears I squeeze!” This deed won Bolga Schlesinger a small complement of humbled men to watch their doors as they slept and the undying devotion of the women.



In the morning they took a ferry to the juncture of the Beaver and Ohio Rivers. There, they found the rewards for the months-long journey were churned mud, squalor, and their husbands. Both couples were delighted to find their spouses had independently befriended each other. 



“What have I always told you, Lars?” Einer Vogel said. “My wife has excellent taste!” He scooped Leena over his shoulder and Rudi under his arm, and carried the pair of them squealing across the threshold of their cabin, with Alice scampering in behind them. 



Lars simply took Frieda’s hands in his and said, “Welcome home, liebling.”",1,1736459626.0,DestructiveReaders,1,1.0,False

Background: We've been together for 15+ years, late 30s. I'm more of an extrovert and tend to collect friends and he is more introverted. He wants hobbies and friend interactions, but quickly loses interest in hobbies or gets frustrated with our friends if they don't match his energy about something (usually a movie night).  He doesn't tend to meet people organically, but will happily engage with someone if they approach him. 

Our current dynamic: We have a close group of friends, about 10 people, that we do things with multiple times a week in varying degrees. I would consider them **our** friends even if they became my friends first. He doesn't have friends outside of that group, and I don't really either, but I will hang out with them one on one, like lunch during the work day. I don't think he has ever tried to do something one on one that I didn't suggest first (hey friend X is looking for someone to go to XYZ with them, why don't you offer). 

I have hobbies, but he always wants to come along and join. Which is fine, really it is, I'm happy to have him there. He's not possessive, he just wants to be involved, if that makes sense.  When we are trying to plan something, he tries to plan things that I'll like vs what he would like, because in his words, he doesn't really have *likes* and he likes what I like. 

Over the last couple of years I've gently encouraged him to join beer leagues (we both joined one with a couple of friends, but my schedule changed so I could no longer go after like 3 games. He quit shortly after because he got hurt. Wouldn't even just go to hang out)  I've encouraged him to start yoga classes to help with his back pain. Gardening clubs, since we have a large garden. Walking daily with our dogs. Board game nights. Literally just anything to get him out of the house and doing something for himself.

 I've never nagged, just stuff like when we were at a seed swaps, there be table for the local master gardens group and I'd say stuff like, ""you'd be so good with all that, you should think about joining the group so you can talk shop about gardening with others. Maybe get some ideas for our garden"" Etc etc. just gentle nudges about things I know he would enjoy if he gave them a chance. (He never does any of the suggestions) 

The problem: we got into a pretty crazy car accident in Oct. He was driving, and it sent him on a pretty severe spiral that landed him in therapy to deal with the PTSD of it. Ever since then, he's become even worse about latching onto  ""my likes"". He still goes out and does things, but only if I am there or I have set it up. At home he pretty much just wants to watch movies (his only hobby) and even then he is playing brain games on his phone at the same time, which I know is probably a coping mechanism and probably something his therapist told him to do.  He leaves the house less and less and I am afraid that if I let him, he will eventually stop trying. Hell, I was happy when he started therapy just because it was something weekly that was getting him out of the house to do something *for him* (his insurance changed at the end of the year, and his therapist isn't in his new network, so he stopped that.  He hasn't found a new one yet. I acknowledge this needs to be done, but I can't do that for him) 

My ""solution"": I like to do NYE resolutions. Beginning of the year, I told him mine and asked about his. He didn't have any. I said "" why don't you look at joining a club or something. It'll be good for you to talk to new people, maybe get out of your head a little"" I got a ""yeah..maybe"" few days later something happened and I finally said, ""look. I've been gentle. I've tried simple encouragement. But you have to leave this house. This year you are leaving this house and doing something for yourself for a minimum of 1 hour every week. I don't care if it's sitting at a coffee shop, driving around for an hour, joining a club, going to the movie theater, I don't care, but you have to leave""  he agreed to do *something*.

we are 9 days into 2025 and he's tried to start a movie club with a local social group (the same one we joined a beer league in last year) but the interest is flakey so far, and I know in my deepest of hearts, he is going to get frustrated when it doesn't work out and then give up and then not do anything else. I've let it be so far, haven't said a word about it, still trying not to be naggy, but I am getting frustrated. 

Guys of reddit.  Please help me. I'm not asking for him to be a socialite like me. I'm not asking for him to approach strangers and ask them to be his friend.  I just need him to get his personality back. When you ask someone their favorite of something the answer shouldn't always be ""I dunno, I don't really have one. I like whatever"" I know he is dealing with a lot from our accident and it is exaggerating a problem that was already there. I'm trying not to push too hard, but at this point I feel like if I don't physically sign him up for something and push him out the door, he is never going to do it himself.  How do I encourage him to get out there??? Like I said, even if it was just driving around for an hour, I wouldn't care, it would at least be something.",1,1736459492.0,AskMenRelationships,0,1.0,False

- Goodwood: If These Walls Could Talk...Gray Cottage Revisted. *Back in 2021, the Panhandle Archaeological Society at Tallahassee (PAST) uncovered clues suggesting that renowned antebellum brick mason Richard A. Shine may have added a unique stucco finish to the cottage’s North Addition in the late 1840s to match Goodwood’s Main House and other historic buildings. But that was just the beginning! In 2022, when the North Addition of the Gray Cottage was set for demolition, the team returned to gather more evidence and even took wood samples for tree-ring dating. This presentation will share what they uncovered, including new details about the original construction, Shine’s craftsmanship, and the materials used. Highlights will also include the results of petrographic analysis of the stucco and fascinating insights into Shine’s life and work, including his famed brickyard. Don’t miss this intriguing peek into Goodwood’s rich history and the discoveries that continue to shape our understanding of the past!

1hxo6tn,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1hxo6tn/question_about_using_np_home_for_dates/,Question about using NP home for dates ,"Pardon the throwaway. So this is a weird situation and I’d appreciate some advice. I can’t really ask the people I’d normally consult because, I feel that they’re a bit too close to the scenario for it to not get out if it turns out I am making a mountain out of a molehill.

Anyway, my husband and I are in an open relationship. I don’t really date others because I’m a shy person with a lot of personal/professional commitments but I’m open to it if the right person comes along. My husband has had other partners. We currently live together in his home city and have been since college. 

He was planning on meeting up with a partner for a date this weekend. They have previously gone to things like coffee or the museum and he had mentioned that things were probably on the road to getting physical in the future. However, it turns out he’ll most likely not be meeting up with her this weekend for a few reasons. The first was reasonable, she’s been sick and doesn’t think she’ll be up to anything. The second is the one I find more problematic. My sister in law is no longer going out of town and that throws a wrench in my husbands plans. He was planning on taking her there after dinner so they could have sex. he says that it's fine because sister in law will never find out, he gets to save money on a hotel, and doesn't have to ask me to leave our place. This , for some reason, makes me incredibly uncomfortable. 

So a few bits of potentially necessary backstory:
1. We agreed that our families shouldn’t know about our poly-ness now because it would do nothing productive but cause a whole lot of stress. This applies as much to my sister in law as it does to any one else. She’s a sweetheart but we’re pretty sure it’d be a whole thing neither of us need to deal with.
2. The sister lives in what used to be the family home. She now lives there herself, pays the rent herself, etc, etc, etc. it was a bit of a minor family argument to get things this way as the parents, both moved off to other locations, didn’t stop seeing it as “their house” for years and would drop in, redecorate, or invite themselves over for long periods of time even when she didn’t want that. (My husband and I had the same issue earlier in our relationship when we lived there briefly—the rent was cheap but I couldn’t handle it not being “our place” if we were living there as a couple. we moved out shortly after). But I know that my sister in law feels similarly, she wants the home to be hers and be respected as such. 
3. My husband and I had an issue springing from our openness recently. When we were in college like 10+ years ago (different colleges in different locations) we agreed to a DADT situation. We never  spoke about it again even after moving in together and getting married, which wasn't great but it never really crossed my mind. It came to a head recently when I caught him in a series of lies about his whereabouts. I asked him if he was sleeping with other people. He said no. He stuck to his story. I went through his phone because I was super bothered by the lie and lo and behold. Since I was more bothered by being actively lied to more than anything, we decided that we could be open as long as there was transparency about names, locations, etc. This has seemed to work out well for the most part. However, I did/do struggle with the fact that he didn't see a problem with continuing to lie to me after I had repeatedly asked him for the truth because it was important to me. He told me he wasn't thinking about how I felt, he just didn't want to have a difficult conversation. 
4. I've made it clear that I'm fine with letting him have our place for dates. I can go see a movie, get dinner with friends, or go to a hotel and watch crappy tv while watching room service. No harm no foul. He says that he's absolutely not comfortable with that. He says that he'd feel scummy asking me to leave home so he could have sex with someone else, even though I've said I'd be okay with it. He says that no reasonable people would ever ask their partner to leave in this scenario. 

So anyway, I'm asking.  Is it not normal for one partner to clear out of the house to give the other space in situation? Am I insane for finding the plan to use the ""for emergency"" set of keys to someone's place for having sex with someone in their apartment as a massive breach of trust? I would be furious at my siblings for doing something similar with my home, but I also withheld emergency keys from friend and family until I got a promise that they wouldn't drop by unannounced even if I wasn't there. Like I'm probably fine with it but I need to know before hand. 

But I also wonder if I'm over reacting because I'm not comfortable with this because I'm not over the fall out from the DADT thing. the fact he's willing to cross a family members boundaries, lie by omission, and risk getting ~found out in a situation where it's 100%, at least in my estimation, not necessary feels grimy but he and his friends think I'm being unreasonable here.

When shopping for diamonds, understanding ""diamond symmetry"" is essential for making an informed choice that will ensure a beautiful and valuable purchase. Here are the key takeaways:

* Diamond symmetry refers to the precise alignment and arrangement of facets on a diamond, impacting both its beauty and light performance. A well-symmetrical diamond will refract light optimally, enhancing its brilliance and fire.
* Symmetry is graded from 'Poor' to 'Excellent' by reputable gemological laboratories like the GIA. 'Excellent' symmetry is now the standard expectation for round brilliant diamonds and is crucial for maximizing visual appeal.
* Studies confirm humans are naturally attracted to symmetrical designs, elevating the desirability of diamonds with high symmetry. The visual appeal significantly influences consumer perception and product value.

* Diamonds with higher symmetry grades tend to be more expensive due to the increased craftsmanship involved. A GIA Triple Excellent report—which signifies excellent polish, symmetry, and cut—is recommended for optimal resale value.
* While symmetry grading is less stringent for fancy shapes, ensuring balance and centering is still key to overall appearance. Buyers should be aware that even 'Very Good' symmetry grades can be acceptable for these cuts.
* Always check the symmetry grade on a gemological report when purchasing. Aim for at least a 'Very Good' grade to ensure lasting beauty and good light performance.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing [from trusted retailers such as those](https://labdiamondsreview.com/diamonds/) that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

# Recommendations for Smart Buying

2. For round brilliant diamonds, aim for 'Excellent' or at least 'Very Good' symmetry
3. Consider the balance between symmetry and other factors like clarity and color
4. For fancy shapes, 'Very Good' symmetry can be acceptable

# FAQ

Q: What exactly is diamond symmetry?

A: Diamond symmetry refers to how precisely the facets align and intersect. It includes factors like edge alignment, uniformity of facet shape and size, and how facets meet at points and corners.

Q: How important is symmetry compared to other diamond characteristics?

A: While important, symmetry should be balanced with other factors like cut, clarity, and color. It's generally better to compromise on symmetry than on overall cut quality.

Q: Can I see differences in symmetry with the naked eye?

A: For untrained eyes, it's difficult to distinguish between 'Excellent' and 'Very Good' symmetry. Noticeable defects are usually only visible in diamonds with 'Fair' or 'Poor' symmetry grades.

Q: Does symmetry significantly affect a diamond's price?

A: Yes, diamonds with 'Excellent' symmetry can be 5-15% more expensive than those with lower grades, due to the increased craftsmanship and consumer perception of value.

Q: Is it worth paying extra for 'Excellent' symmetry?

A: For most buyers, the visual difference between 'Excellent' and 'Very Good' symmetry is subtle. However, if you're looking for the best possible sparkle and resale value, excellent symmetry can be beneficial.

As the title says, I am looking for a casual chat partner. It's easier said than done, to be honest, but if you are here, hopefully, we will connect.

I am 39, a working professional who landed on Reddit by chance and just got hooked on it, as most of us do, due to wonderful communities and subs. I am married and father to a wonderful daughter whom I love to the moon and back.

So, what am I seeking here? That's a good question, and to be honest, I am just trying to explore and discover myself. Yes, at this age, I am. I have been working rigorously for the last 15 years nonstop and have given my all to my family and running finances, but in the last few months, something clicked in me, and I decided that I should pay a bit of attention to discovering outside my monotonous life.

Please do not judge me. I love my wife and family to the core, but this whole thing is about me and I don't want to give an explanation about it to anyone else, perhaps someone in my situation will understand my point of view.

I am a shy and introverted personality with a minimum social circle. I am an exceptionally good listener and I never judge. A kind heart who always prioritizes smiles on others rather on self - as my near ones say. I give off nerd vibes - so love technology and gadgets, and I watch a lot of sci-fi. Space movies intrigue me a lot and mix that with Dragonball anime - you know how I am.

I love coffee and chocolates, I can be bribed over them.

I am open to chatting about anything, yes anything (SFW/NSFW/mix) and if we hit it off, I don't mind it being a long-term connection. Oh! I just love the thrill of waiting for a message - the anticipation!!!

You can be anywhere in the world! Just have an open mind! If you like what I wrote drop a Reddit message with a few lines about yourself. Also, I am not looking for any affair or relationship. Just harmless fun!

Looking forward to connecting.",1,1736459023.0,LetsChat,0,1.0,False

1hxo3ga,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1hxo3ga/a_happy_accident/,A happy accident,"I brewed a cup of coffee today. Normally I choose whole beans from a local roaster, though recently I have been using a chain grocery store coffee. I loaded an aeropress with 11 grams of coffee, and 350 grams of water. Typically I use a kettle that isn’t for pouring, since the water is faster to pour. This time I poured too fast. 

Coffee grounds went all over the scale, and the aeropress too. I felt sort of annoyed, so I let it sit, I didn’t even shove the plunger in. 30 seconds go by, I press the plunger, and then plunge for 30 more seconds, until the coffee is all in the mug. (Any longer steep time, and I find this cheaper coffee ends up unpleasantly bitter) 

To clean any grounds out of the mug, I took a cone filter and funnel and poured the brew into a new cup. 

The result was suprising. The end brew tasted better than had I normally brewed without accident, and cleaner having filtered it. Personally, I prefer immersion to other methods, but this was like a better version of a pourover coffee. 

I believe this could potentially create a better cup coffee if I used whole beans, and then filtered the result twice as I had done before. 

I felt like sharing my experience. Has anyone else tried this? ",1,1736458928.0,AeroPress,0,1.0,False

This includes eating out. 

We rarely eat out maybe once every few weeks because every time we do it's at a minimum of $50 for the tip. 

We do not eat breakfast, only coffee as we fast until lunch and then have a big lunch and supper, we spend right at $1,000 a month and we eat pretty healthy, we don't buy processed food,only whole foods and most of the time it's not organic, as that would increase the cost quite a bit more.

We do eat steaks one night a week for one of our meals as that is the most expensive meal we have which cost us about $30 to cook at home for a couple nice steaks and some potatoes. 

I've spoken with a few other people who say they only spend 3 to $400 a month and I honestly cannot figure out how they do it unless they're only eating ramen noodles and other junk. Not knocking it if that's what you have to do that's what you have to do to survive just trying to figure out what everybody else is spending per month to see what the average is.

By Deena Shanker and Daniela Sirtori January 9, 2025 at 7:10 AM PST

Dutch Bros Inc. dropped its upcharge for non-dairy milks, following a similar move by larger competitor Starbucks Corp.

The change went into effect on Jan. 1, according to a customer service message from the chain shared with Bloomberg News by the Center for Responsible Food Business, an advocacy group that has pushed companies to remove fees on non-dairy milk.

Dutch Bros has 950 locations in the US. It was the third-largest coffee chain in the US by sales in 2023, according to data compiled by researcher Technomic.

“Dutch Bros’ decision to drop its non-dairy milk surcharge is a step in the right direction and a clear sign that the tides are turning in the coffee industry,” said Taylor Warren, CRFB’s president. The group argues the extra cost is discriminatory against customers who can’t drink milk or want to choose a more environmentally friendly option.

Dutch Bros confirmed the move, saying it was part of its “larger commitment to customization.” The company’s shares rose 65% in 2024, compared to a 5% decline for Starbucks.

Starbucks dropped its non-dairy milk surcharge starting Nov. 7, effectively cutting prices for some customers as it seeks to revive growth. Previously, non-dairy milk would cost 70 to 80 cents, depending on the market.",3,1736458459.0,dutchbros,0,1.0,False

1. inb4 find griner (I already turned the inner scale of my Smart Grinder Pro to the finest setting): I feel like when I go too fine - no matter how careful I puck prep, I get channeling and i'm straying away from my goal of \~45g in 30s - I already ordered a DF54 which hopefully will arrive in 1-3 weeks but you know how it is - that feels like a very long time. If I go coarser, the machine obviously doesn't get up to pressure.

2. I'm using an IMS basket now because I didn't want to get used to the bad stock option and directly start dialing in with a more reliable basket. In the beginning when I didn't have all the tools I have now, I just heavily overfilled the stock basket (like 20g in a 18g basket) and got the best results I have gotten yet. Is this just the way to go with my machine?

  
When I look at my pucks after brewing they look very clean, come out as one piece, have no burnt areas as far as I can tell and don't break or crumble - which they would if there was strong channeling, right?  
My machine reaches the wanted pressure zone of 8-10 bars every time and yet - 30s leave me with 60-75g of thin, more or less sour Espresso.

Is anybody out there that has experience with the Marchesa or similar Graef machines and/or has any idea what I might be overlooking?

Thank you very much in advance and keep sipping. Cheers.",1,1736458054.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

Could That Be You?,"**Hello, gentlemen!** I’m CharmedCynic, a 30-year-old Japanese-American woman (second-generation, or “nisei”) living in Stamford, Connecticut for a 9-month teaching fellowship. Education is my passion, and I’m thriving in this exciting chapter of my life.

I’m 5'4"", with almond-shaped deep brown eyes, medium-length dark brown hair, two pierced ears, and three tattoos—a rose on my upper right shoulder, a bluebird on my right hand, and a lilac on my left forearm. My style? A mix of classic elegance and artistic flair—because I don’t do boring, and neither should you.

I live for the little joys—sipping on cranberry vodka or a gin and tonic under the city lights, or sharing laughs over coffee and cake. I’m not into loud parties; I prefer meaningful moments, authentic connections, and deep conversations that make me feel like I’ve found something real. Politically moderate, non-religious, and always grounded.

When I’m not working, I’m all about writing, drawing, listening to synthwave, or diving into 80s/90s nostalgia with films like *Dogfight*, *Cruel Intentions*, *Stand By Me*, *Career Opportunities*, *Secret Admirer*, and *The Bling Ring*. My playlists are filled with dreamy tracks like “Sunset” by The Midnight, “Summer Eyes” by Coastal, and “Miracle Love” by Lazer Club.

While I love my independence, I’m looking for that one special person who feels like my best friend. Someone I can laugh with, share inside jokes with, and build a life together filled with trust, joy, and romance. I’m all about those magical moments—the kind where you lock eyes, share a smile, and feel like you’ve found your person.

**What I’m looking for:**

* **Age Range:** 28-37 (must be mature but fun!)
* **Height:** 5'10"" or taller—gotta keep up with me.
* **Build:** Slim, fit, lean—keep it sharp.
* **Lifestyle:** Drug-free (no molly, edibles, coke, etc.) with moderate drinking okay
* **Location:** Connecticut or within 25-35 miles (US/Canada preferred)
* **Relationship Goals:** Long-term, monogamous, with marriage potential. Bonus points if you’re open to the idea of starting a family someday!

**Non-negotiables:**

* You’re emotionally available, single, and not hung up on past relationships (it’s time to focus on us).
* You’re a communicator, and consistency matters to you. The small gestures go a long way with me.

If you're kind, stable, and ready for something meaningful, I’d love to hear from you! Please include a photo in your message, and if we vibe, I’ll happily share one back. Let’s make this journey unforgettable. 💕",0,1736457858.0,r4r,1,0.43,False

 I'm 22F that happens to meet him a 30+ M on a random encounter sa tricycle. Yung 1st encounter na iyon kay it was a mundane chat about life and current events hanggang sa we talk about some personal stuff. I dont mind sharing and making friends talaga since I was on the process of healing myself after having a mental breakdown. 

I treat him like a friend and distance myself kay first encounter nga namin. At that time i thought he was like a cool tito with his wide ideas and open beliefs. Naging friends kami sa fb but i rarely chat with him since im not that active much due to school works. 

I do tend to overshare sa life ko and I mentioned sa kanya may small business ako selling preloved anik-aniks. Interested siya bumili. So work mode ako, and we meet for the 2nd time. At first, I thought business transaction lng because that was we talked about thru chat and have small talks and we part ways. We meet up at the Mall around 3 pm.

The dude was dressed up. 

I felt my stomach churn. Here in our province, it's common na pambahay or casual clothes lng pagpumasok sa mall. I just tend overdress talaga to express myself when going out. 

I was shock when he asked we grab something to eat. I find it odd but I comply and suggest a coffee shop since i wont be staying long talaga kay business transaction nga. But, he openly said no and we ate at the food court. 

1st alarming bells: libre daw niya daw. And i dont want to eat talaga dahil diet but he keeps insisting na kakain ako. Mahiya ako may manglibre unless close na close ko na ang person.

2nd AB: He said lalo daw ako gumanda ngayon. (Dude we just met twice😭)

3rd: he tried to spoon feed me despite me saying no. 

4th: He talks about relationships and advices. And i clearly stated na i have no interest in romantic relationship so di nako to needed. Added he keeps mentioning about marriage.

5th: gusto niya magroam around sa mall. Which i didnt agree to in the first place. BUSINESS ang ginadtuan ko hindi pasyal. 

6th: insisted to sabay me to the terminal sa paguwi. 

7th: throughout the walk chatting out sa mall, he sometimes patted my back and tried to get too close to my personal space. (Hindi ako comfortable) while giving advices na di nako need.

As I go home of course hindi na siya kasabay hanggang sa entrance ng terminal lng niya ako hinatid. (I paid the fare on my own kay lain na ang loob ko)

My guts telling me to run away throughout the encounter but i hold it in hanggang sa ako na magisa. 

I felt dumb at that time kay lahi ang treatment niya sa akin. I might be gullible and i felt uncomfy na iyon. I couldn't speak out what i feel kay i thought he was just being friendly nga but I can feel it is not. 

I open up it to my friends and suggested me to block him on my social media and even on my business page account. Im not sure what to do?


Is it possible may crush siya sa ako? How do i deal with this?

https://preview.redd.it/5otw0pzl41ce1.png?width=1956&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d982c9d6053f91e39d7a86bdabe2b4bd1a3d294

r/GaylorSwift, we have arrived… at the tournament megathread! [As the prophecy foretold.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/1h0bp05/gauging_interest_mashups_madness/)

Hopefully it will provide a bit of an escape from... *\*gestures broadly\** My thoughts are with the people in California who have been affected by the fires there; it's horrific and so devastating. There’s lots of info out there on how we can help. And sometimes a silly goofy distraction helps too. (I hope so, anyway.) So with that, onward!

Over the course of **13 days**, **starting on 13 January,** we’ll try to answer an essential and deeply serious question:

**🎶 What was the gayest mashup that Taylor played on The Eras Tour? 🎶**

In this **community-vote-based** [**bracket tournament**](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/tournament-brackets-101), our songs will face off in one-on-one, round by round match-ups. Winning songs in each match-up will advance, while the losing song is eliminated.

I’ve grouped 128 of the 138 total mashups from the tour into 8 conferences of 16 songs each.

[me for the last six weeks](https://preview.redd.it/p2fp7gzdc1ce1.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=763109b67ff02d2903feea5c5075b04db104a900)

The songs will battle their way through their conference, and then the 8 conference champions will advance to the playoffs.

We'll keep going until we reach the final showdown between the two gayest mashups to ever gay on The Eras Tour.

The journey won’t be easy; the slopes will be treacherous. We’ll face seemingly impossible choices.

But what better time than Capricorn season to begin this competition of relentless excellence? We'll need to be ruthless with our votes. But like the mighty Capricorn, we'll remain clear-eyed about our goal. Out of 128 contenders, only one gay little musical mountain goat can ascend to the peak, goat-scream to the heavens, and claim the crown of **Gayest Eras Tour Mashup**.

What will it be?

# Tournament Info

**Structure**

* **Tournament Dates:** Monday, 13 January through Saturday, 25 January
   * *Aussies/Kiwis/folks on this side of the intl date line -- it'll likely start late on the 13th or early on the 14th for us*
* **Conference Stage:** Round of 128 → Conference Quarterfinals → Conference Semifinals → Conference Finals
* **Playoffs:** Evermore Eight → Fearless Four → Semifinal → Final
* **Note:** Due to the nature of bracket tournaments, not every song will face off against every other song—they’ll only face the songs that are in their path to the championship. So, your personal top gayest mashups might not all get the chance to face each other directly. But that’s part of the fun (and chaos) of bracket tournaments—it's all about how match-ups unfold round by round!

**Voting**

* Once the tournament begins, the community will (hopefully!) vote in daily threads
* Voting should be based on your opinion and personal interpretation of each mashup pair, using whatever criteria you choose to apply to the question: **Which is gayer?**
* More info on voting below

**Seeding**

* *This is something I've already done—not something you need to do!*
* Seeding is the process of ranking entrants in a tournament to determine where they sit in the bracket ""tree"" and which opponents they will face throughout the tournament
* I've ranked the songs in each conference based on their apparent gayness
* Higher seeded (more obviously gay) songs will face lower seeded (less obviously gay) songs in the early rounds
* This structure ensures that the top contenders don't meet and knock each other out too early, and makes for exciting showdowns later in the tournament
* Feel free to chat about seeding, but please be kind about it—it was a difficult task! The difference in some of the songs was razor-thin, or it depended on the angle you were looking at it from, and things could have gone any number of ways. Interpretations of any song will obviously differ, some may have special meanings for individual people, and my seedings aren't meant to be definitive. (I could have kept tinkering with them until the heat death of the universe.) They're just meant to serve as a jumping-off-point for the tournament, and hopefully for some fun discussions!

# How to Play

The tournament will take place on the subreddit. Here's how you can take part!

**1. In Advance: Fill in Your Bracket and Predict the Winner (Optional! But fun)**

* Think you know the gayest mashup Taylor performed on the Eras Tour? PROVE IT!
* Before the tournament begins, [download a copy of the Mashups Mayhem Bracket Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VKrIMGzz5HhQe8zJrBBOBbKH95rOufNWwQYOyaRCg7M/copy) **to fill in your own tournament bracket**
* Work your way from the outside of each side of the bracket tabs (left and right sides of the spreadsheet) inward toward the centre
* The spreadsheet includes:
   * A welcome page with further info
   * **Bracket tabs (\*\*3 tabs\*\*)**: Fill in your picks for the entire tournament here
   * Conference and seeding info: See how the songs were grouped and ranked
   * Links to videos of every mashup
   * More effort than I've ever applied to any spreadsheet-based task at my place of employment
* **Honestly, baby, who's counting?** We're not keeping score or logging points for correct guesses or anything. This is just for fun, and your bracket is just for you to have (and/or to brag/despair about in the megathread)

**2. Vote Daily (13-25 January)**

* The tournament will begin on **Monday, 13 January 2025. This is the first day of voting.**
* Each day, I (posting from the account u/MashupsMayhem) will share a voting thread
* I will create comments that allow you to vote on that day's match-ups—**upvote whatever mashup you think is gayer in each pair**
* Voting threads will be locked and set to contest mode—this means you won't see which songs are winning when you vote
* You'll have about 24 hours to vote in each round (until I get a coffee from the cafe downstairs and sit down to post the next one, basically)
* I'll try to post around the same time each day; please note I'm in an Australian time zone so that'll impact when you see the threads pop up

**3. Follow Along**

* Winners from each day will be revealed in the next day’s voting thread, and I’ll also update the Mashups Mayhem Master Spreadsheet as we go

**4. Yap About It**

* Feeling like Cassandra? You've gotten everything right so far and are clearly on your way to a perfect bracket? Or did your predictions get driven off the road by a bracket-buster upset? Want to discuss the finer points of that day's match-ups in excruciating detail with your fellow nerds?
* **Chat about all things Mashups Mayhem here in the Megathread!**
* **Be kind and cool to each other** (and to me, please!) in this discussion thread (as this community always is) and remember, **this tournament is for funsies**. It's intended to be a lighthearted way to hold onto the memories Eras gave us, and provide an opportunity for discussion of this incredibly unique body of work.

# Questions...?

Ask in the comments and I'll try my best to answer/troubleshoot/commiserate over feeling like you just can't choose!

**Thanks and Shoutouts**: To the mod team for letting me do this; to u/1DMod for all the advice and feedback on logistics and the spreadsheet, and general awesomeness; u/starting\_to\_learn and u/Icy-Narwhal-902 for looking over the seedings and giving incredibly thoughtful feedback that made me excited about the conversations that I hope we'll all get to have over this two weeks; and u/hereslookinatyoukld for the [extensive archive of all mashups they put together](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/1gwr0c2/mashup_transcripts/), including transcribed lyrics, which was invaluable in the seeding process. If you really want to get in amongst it with analysing these mashups, I can't recommend enough that you read through the composite lyrics as though they were brand new songs. And thanks to the community for being interested in doing this!

**We're about to go on a little journey together...** let's have fun!

I’ve posted on here before and just refreshing for another round :) 

A bit about me - I’m a 32 year old, 6ft male living in Arizona - currently in Flagstaff and previously Phoenix and Reno NV. 

I love getting outdoors - a few things I enjoy are hiking, trail running, paddle boarding, mountain biking, and camping. 

Other than the outdoor activities, I love road trips, traveling, art of all kinds, board games, and working out of coffee shops.

I’m hoping to find a partner with some similar interests and wants to live the DINK life! 

Some things I really value are emotional intelligence, patience, sense of adventure, effort, and what I call a “fuck yeah” mindset haha. I’m passionate about my hobbies and love the work I do.

Anyways, if this sounds like you and you like what you see/read one here, shoot me a DM! Would love to chat some more :

There some gaps and maybe some inaccuracies so feel free to comment what you think should be changed! There also women who John dated secretly or had one night stands with. There were plenty unnamed women who John casually hooked up with that might not be mentioned....*

**December 1989/January 1990**: John took Christina Haag out to dinner with Jackie, Caroline and Ed for the holidays.

**Late January 1990**: It's reported that John visited Danville several times because he was dating Daryl Hannah and she was starring in a movie that was being made in Chatham, VA called ‘Crazy People’ .

**February 13, 1990**: John was seen out with model Ashley Richardson with whom he had only 2 dates.

**December 5, 1990**: John took Christina as his date to a Naked Angels Theater group fundraiser event.

**December 8, 1990**: John is still officially with Christina and she is his date at his big 30th birthday party he threw with Santina Goodman.

**late July/ Early August 1991:** John and Lisa Shields are seen together. She mentioned in the new JFK Jr biography that she had something casual with him and she wasn't under the illusion that she was the only woman in his life.

Kathleen and Julie got along well. The harvest party was in the woods in the western suburbs of Boston.(Forever Young, William S. Noonan).

**October 11-12, 1991**: John attended the sixth annual King Biscuit Blues Festival held annually in Helena, Arkansas. People magazine wrote: *Clarksdale had a distinguished visitor recently when John F. Kennedy Jr., son of the late U.S. president, stayed here for one entire weekend.

Our elopement may be considered a micro-wedding to some. Essentially, we want to have a “ceremony” that is just the two of us and a “reception” with 20 of our closest friends and family. And by “reception” I mean artisan pizzas, beer & wine, and a bonfire lol. Luckily, we found an Airbnb on a beautiful property near ONP that will accommodate everyone for 2 nights and is within our budget. 

I’m torn on the timing of the elopement celebration. We plan to elope in the morning anyway. Think sunrise photos in ONP and exchanging vows over french press coffee. Would it be too much to have the elopement celebration in the same day? It’s more cost-effective to do it the same day and I know it would technically work timing wise, but will it be too rushed? Is it worth it to make the elopement its own day, even if it costs us more money?

1hxnape,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1hxnape/the_legend_of_bootyman_brown_jokepasta/,The Legend of Bootyman Brown (Jokepasta),"Once upon a time, there lived a black man named DeShawn ""Bootyman"" Brown. DeShawn wasn’t your ordinary black man. He had a special *love* for... the booty. And I don’t mean just any booty, I mean the finest, most glorious booty in all the land. He was a booty lover and rapist who were fuck, rape, and have sex with Women, Transgender Women, Asexual Women, Genderfluid Woman, and any gender some females had If they had huge or big booties. No one quite understood his obsession, but legend has it that Bootyman’s life was one of constant, undying pursuit of what he called ""The Booty.""

DeShawn’s love for the booty was so legendary that he would spend his days... let's just say, admiring and taking a deep interest in it. He wasn’t shy about his admiration, either. But it wasn't just any booty that caught his eye. No, Bootyman had a unique talent: He could spot a perfect booty from *miles* away. No matter how big, small, or... *curvy* it was, he was drawn to it like a moth to a flame. Some say he could smell it from a mile away, others claim he could hear it jiggle like a distant thunderstorm.

But here's where things get strange. You see, every time Bootyman got caught, which happened frequently—he was, after all, a black man driven by a most absurd obsession—Every time when he gets locked up for... let’s just say, *‘booty-related incidents’* (no one really knew exactly what happened in those situations), Yet, no matter how many times they put him behind bars, Bootyman always managed to escape. Some say he slipped out through the ventilation, others say he just *willed* himself out, like some sort of supernatural booty sorcerer.

He was seen everywhere, Every day, every week, every month and Every Year—during morning, afternoon, noon, nighttime, midnight, he'd be out and about, eyeing the finest booties at the local coffee shop. In the afternoon, he could be found at the gym, in the park, or simply strolling down the street, wearing an unreasonably large pair of sunglasses. At noon, he was often found in the middle of a heated debate with any female or male who dared question his love for the booty. ""Why do you love booty so much, Bootyman?"" they’d ask. And his answer was always the same: ""It's not about the booty. It's about the *spirit* of the booty.""

But the most curious part? No matter what, Bootyman always showed up at midnight. That's right, midnight. As the clock struck twelve, he would often sneak into people's homes with females. He wouldn’t take anything—no, no, no. Bootyman didn’t need your TV or your expensive toaster. What he *wanted*... was the booty. But not in a creepy way! He wasn’t there to steal it. Oh, no. Bootyman was just there to fuck or *admire* it, maybe give it a little appreciative pat and say something like, “Now that’s a booty worth celebrating.” Then, he'd leave, leaving behind a trail of confused and mildly disturbed homeowners.

Rumor has it that every year, the town throws a *Booty Festival* in honor of Bootyman Brown. During the festival, Bootyman can be seen walking around in an Orange shirt, wearing red Air Jordans, and wearing big baggy pants with a shiny belt that reads ""BOOTY KING"" in all caps. He doesn’t need an invitation, because Bootyman Brown *is* the party. If you catch him at the festival, he might even teach you his signature dance, the ""Booty Boogie,"" which, frankly, looks like a man who just ate a really spicy burrito and is trying to shake it off.

But the weirdest part? No one has ever caught Bootyman for good. He's like a ghost, except instead of haunting graveyards, he's haunting every living room, dance floor, and yoga class within a 50-mile radius. Every time Someone thinks they've seen the last of him, Bootyman emerges again, smiling, ready to continue his eternal quest for Female booty.

So, if you ever find yourself walking down the street in the morning, afternoon, or midnight, and you feel a strange chill in the air, a strange *sensation*, know this: Bootyman Brown is watching. And he's loving the booty. Always. Forever.

The moral of the story? You can’t escape Bootyman. The booty calls to him, and he’s always ready for the next adventure, whether you like it or not.",1,1736456849.0,copypasta,2,1.0,False

# Have you ever taken a sip of a drink expecting it to be hot or cold, only to find it lukewarm? Disappointing, isn’t it? Now imagine Jesus feeling that way about our faith. This is exactly what He confronts in Revelation 3:16: ""So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth"" (KJV).

**Video** [**https://youtube.com/shorts/DCuwmXCUubA?si=wnVUwaAw8lOgLXyl**](https://youtube.com/shorts/DCuwmXCUubA?si=wnVUwaAw8lOgLXyl) 

Today, let’s explore what it means to be lukewarm, why it’s dangerous, and how we can ignite a faith that pleases God. Buckle up—this is going to be both fun and deeply convicting!

# The Context of Laodicea

Before we dive into the heart of this passage, let’s set the scene. Laodicea was a wealthy city in Asia Minor, famous for its:

* **Wealth and Commerce**: It was a banking hub. Think of it as the Wall Street of the ancient world.
* **Black Wool Industry**: Their luxurious garments were sought after far and wide.
* **Medical Advancements**: They produced a famous eye salve that was believed to cure vision problems.

But here’s the kicker: Laodicea had a major issue—it lacked a reliable water source. The city imported hot water from nearby Hierapolis and cold water from Colossae. By the time it reached Laodicea, the water was lukewarm, leaving a bad taste in people’s mouths. Jesus brilliantly uses this physical reality as a metaphor for their spiritual state.

# What Does ""Lukewarm"" Really Mean?

To understand this metaphor, let’s break it down:

1. **Hot Faith**: Passionate, zealous, and fully committed to God. Think of Peter’s bold declaration in Matthew 16:16: *""Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.""*
2. **Cold Faith**: While it may seem negative, cold faith can be refreshing, like a cool drink on a hot day. It represents clarity and honesty, even if it’s distant from God. God can work with someone who’s aware of their spiritual need.
3. **Lukewarm Faith**: Tepid, indifferent, and self-reliant. It’s the “meh” attitude of faith. The Laodiceans weren’t passionate about God, nor did they acknowledge their need for Him. Instead, they coasted on their wealth and comfort.

**Fun Fact:** The term ""lukewarm"" became so associated with mediocrity that it entered our modern vocabulary to describe anything uninspired or halfhearted!

# Why is Lukewarmness So Dangerous?

1. **It Displeases God** Jesus’ response is clear: lukewarm faith is repulsive. The Greek word for ""spue"" (ἐμέω, *emeo*) literally means ""to vomit."" This vivid image shows how unacceptable spiritual indifference is to God.
2. **It Breeds Complacency** The Laodiceans said, *""I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing""* (Revelation 3:17). Their material wealth blinded them to their spiritual poverty. When we rely on worldly comforts, we risk losing sight of our need for God.
3. **It Lacks Purpose** Hot faith heals; cold faith refreshes. Lukewarm faith does neither. It’s like salt that has lost its savor—good for nothing (Matthew 5:13).

# How Do We Avoid Being Lukewarm?

**1. Acknowledge Your Need for God**  
Jesus said to the Laodiceans, *""Thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked""* (Revelation 3:17). These harsh words were meant to wake them up. Recognizing our spiritual poverty is the first step toward revival.

**2. Seek Refinement**  
Jesus counsels them to buy *""gold tried in the fire""* (Revelation 3:18). This represents a faith refined through trials. Don’t avoid challenges—they’re opportunities for growth.

**3. Clothe Yourself in Righteousness**  
The Laodiceans were known for their luxurious black wool, but Jesus told them to wear *""white raiment.""* This symbolizes the purity and righteousness that only Christ provides (Isaiah 1:18).

**4. Restore Your Spiritual Vision**  
Jesus said, *""Anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see""* (Revelation 3:18). Just as their city was known for physical eye salve, they needed spiritual insight to see their true condition.

**5. Open the Door**  
Jesus ends with an invitation: *""Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me""* (Revelation 3:20). Lukewarmness keeps Jesus outside. True faith invites Him in.

#  Related Scriptures

1. **Matthew 22:37**: *""Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.""* Passionate love for God is the antidote to lukewarmness.
2. **Romans 12:11**: *""Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.""* This verse encourages fervency in serving God.
3. **James 1:22**: *""Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only.""* Lukewarm faith hears but doesn’t act.

# Fun Fact - The Coffee Analogy

Did you know the average person drinks 3 cups of coffee a day? Imagine if every cup was lukewarm! Just as we desire our coffee hot or iced, God desires our faith to be full of flavor—either refreshingly cold or passionately hot. Tepid coffee and tepid faith? Both get tossed out!

# A Prayer for Renewal

Heavenly Father,  
We come before You, confessing the times we’ve been lukewarm in our faith. Forgive us for our apathy and self-reliance. Ignite a fire in our hearts, Lord. Refine us like gold in the fire. Clothe us in Your righteousness and restore our spiritual vision. May we love You with all our heart, soul, and mind, serving You passionately every day. Thank You for standing at the door of our hearts, knocking. Today, we open that door wide for You. In Jesus’ name, Amen.

 **Choose Hot or Cold**

The message to the Church of Laodicea is a wake-up call for all believers. Being lukewarm isn’t just ineffective—it’s spiritually dangerous. But Jesus doesn’t leave us without hope. He offers us refinement, righteousness, and renewal. Let’s choose to live with passion, purpose, and a vibrant faith that honors Him.

**So, what’s it going to be? Hot, cold, or lukewarm? The choice is yours—but make it epic!**

1hxn5t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1hxn5t2/who_thinks_ill_wear_the_dress_tomorrow/,Who thinks I'll wear the dress tomorrow?,"So this year I have made a fresh commitment to myself. My egg only cracked in July last year, and I changed my name in August but I was still introducing myself to some people as my boy name (it's not so different from my girl name)... and I've still been wearing ""tomboy"" clothes that are plausibly deniable... and I've still been using the boys' bathroom...

So the commitment I made for 2025 was to *embrace the fact I'm actually a woman.*

I'm no longer willing to introduce myself by my old name.

I'm beginning to be unwilling to use the boys' bathroom. I have a good mental note of cafés etc. that have gender-neutral bathrooms. I haven't yet dared to use the girls' but I can use the disabled or gender-neutral etc. But I'm pretty sure I haven't used a boys' bathroom this year and I'd love to keep it that way.

But here's the big one... I tried out wearing a dress in front of others over Christmas... first in front of my dad and his wife (it went okay), then her brother and wife came over and I stayed in the dress. They were cool about it.

So it's time to take it public.

I have a couple of pretty safe events coming up where I'm *very* likely to wear it... music nights where I play... I can drive there, park right outside and then get inside the safety of the venue with people I know (and who are all pretty awesome and accepting). That's this coming Monday and the other one is in a couple of weeks.

But I'd love to wear my dress to my college class tomorrow. It's the first place I went all-in and introduced myself from day one as Georgia (she/her) and the group have been super-accepting. I actually bought the stuff I'm planning to wear last week when I met up with one of my classmates for a coffee... I mentioned I was thinking about getting some clothes and she offered to come with me. Yay! It was amazing.

So I know the college will be totally safe.

BUT... it involves a five minute walk down my own street to the bus stop. A 30-minute bus ride. A 15-minute walk to my ""Friday café"" for breakfast. Another 15-minute walk to the college. And all again in reverse after.

Isn't that, like, terrifying? But it shouldn't be, because I am a woman and I have every right to walk down the street in a dress.

So I'm undecided. I'll be going to bed in about an hour and have an early alarm to get up in time...

What do you think? Will I wear the dress?

What might make me decide either way?

I could do that ""coin flip"" thing where you flip a coin and you HAVE TO abide by the result of the flip, but you keep the result hidden. Then you think about what you'd secretly love it to show if you were to reveal it. And then you do that.

----------------------------------------------------

Staging a kitchen effectively can significantly increase your chances of selling your home quickly and at a good price. A well-staged kitchen creates an inviting atmosphere, allowing potential buyers to envision themselves cooking and entertaining in the space. Here are some essential tips to help you stage your kitchen like a pro.

### Declutter and Clean

The first step in staging your kitchen is to declutter. A tidy kitchen is essential to make the space feel larger and more welcoming. Start by removing all items from countertops, including appliances, knick-knacks, and any items you don't use daily. After decluttering, give your kitchen a thorough clean. Pay special attention to:

- Countertops
- Cabinet fronts
- Appliances
- Sink and fixtures
- Floors

A sparkling, clean kitchen will impress visitors and show that the space has been cared for.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-staging-kitchen  
  
### Enhance Countertop Appeal

Once your countertops are clear, arrange a few well-placed items to create an inviting atmosphere. Consider adding:

- A stylish fruit bowl filled with fresh fruits
- A chic cutting board with a well-placed knife
- Flowers or herbs in attractive pots

Avoid overcrowding the counters; less is more. This way, you show off the space while providing some visual interest.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-staging-kitchen  
  
### Organize Cabinets and Drawers

Although buyers won't always look inside your cabinets and drawers, having them organized and cleaned is vital. This gives the impression that the kitchen has enough storage space and is easy to maintain. Neatly place your dishes, pots, and utensils and consider removing any items that are rarely used. Use dividers or organizers to keep everything tidy and space-efficient. Remember, the inner spaces should reflect the overall cleanliness of your kitchen.

### Choose a Neutral Palette

While your personal tastes might lean towards bold colors, it's wise to stick to neutral color palettes when staging. Neutral colors create a calming atmosphere and allow potential buyers to imagine their own style in the space. If your cabinets are dark or brightly colored, consider painting them in a light, neutral tone. If painting is not an option, update cabinet hardware with metallic or polished finishes for a fresh look.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-staging-kitchen  
  
### Update Lighting

The right lighting can transform the ambiance of your kitchen. Ensure that all fixtures are clean and in good condition. Brighten up the space with the following tips:

- Replace burnt-out bulbs with energy-efficient ones.
- Consider under-cabinet lighting for added warmth.
- Open curtains or blinds to let natural light flow in.

A well-lit kitchen will feel more inviting and spacious to prospective buyers.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-staging-kitchen  
  
### Accessorize Wisely

Accessories can make a significant difference in your staging process. Choose a few tasteful accents that resonate with a potential buyer's lifestyle. Consider the following:

- Stylish kitchen towels and pot holders
- Decorative dishware displayed on open shelves
- An attractive rug to add warmth beneath the dining table or sink area

Remember to keep accessories minimal to avoid clutter. Your goal is to enhance the kitchen's appeal, not distract from it.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-staging-kitchen  
  
### Add Inviting Aromas

Preparing your kitchen for buyers isn't just about visuals; it’s also about creating a pleasant experience for the senses. Consider simple tactics to make the kitchen smell inviting:

- Bake cookies or bread shortly before showings.
- Simmer spices or citrus on the stove to create a warm aroma.
- Keep the trash can empty and clean to avoid unpleasant smells.

These details can leave a lasting impression on potential buyers.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-staging-kitchen  
  
### Showcase Dining Space

If your kitchen includes a dining area, stage it beautifully to entice buyers. Set the table with attractive dinnerware and a decorative centerpiece, making the space feel ready for entertaining. This portrayal will encourage buyers to imagine hosting family and friends, contributing to an emotional connection with the home.

Staging your kitchen effectively can significantly increase your home’s appeal to prospective buyers. By following these tips, you create an inviting and visually appealing space that showcases the potential of one of the most important rooms in the house. Take the time to invest in your kitchen staging, and watch as inquiries and offers start to roll in.

The Impact of Kitchen Staging on Home Sale Value
------------------------------------------------

Your kitchen often acts as the heart of your home. When selling your property, it's essential to make this space inviting and appealing to potential buyers. Staging your kitchen can significantly affect the sale value of your home. In fact, a well-staged kitchen can create an emotional connection with buyers, helping them visualize their lives in that space. Let’s explore how kitchen staging impacts home sale value, and discover essential tips to achieve the best results.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-staging-kitchen  
  
### Creating a Welcoming Atmosphere

A welcoming kitchen atmosphere is crucial when attracting buyers. Here’s how staging can elevate the mood:

- **Light and Bright:** Brighten up the space with natural light. Clean windows and light-colored curtains can make the kitchen feel larger and more inviting.
- **Neutral Palette:** Use neutral colors on walls and cabinets. This allows buyers to envision their style without being distracted by bold patterns or colors.
- **Clean and Organized:** A clean and organized kitchen speaks volumes. Declutter countertops and ensure that appliances are in working order.

### Highlighting Functional Spaces

When staging your kitchen, highlighting the functionality of the space is key. This invites buyers to think about how they would use the kitchen in their daily lives:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-staging-kitchen  
  
- **Showcase the Layout:** Arrange furniture and appliances to showcase the flow of the space. A well-planned layout emphasizes functionality and usability.
- **Define Areas:** If you have an eat-in kitchen, set a small table with attractive place settings. This helps buyers envision family meals and gatherings.
- **Display Storage:** Open cabinets to show storage solutions, or place attractive containers on shelves. This can demonstrate how much space the kitchen actually provides.

### Upgrades and Enhancements

Simple upgrades can dramatically increase the appeal of your kitchen. Consider these enhancements:

- **New Hardware:** Changing cabinet knobs and drawer pulls can give a fresh look without a significant investment.
- **Backsplash Update:** If your budget allows, installing a new backsplash can modernize the kitchen’s aesthetic.
- **Lighting Fixtures:** Good lighting can enhance the kitchen’s atmosphere. Replace outdated fixtures with modern options for added flair.

### Evoking Sensory Experiences

Staging isn’t just visual. Engaging the senses can also create a positive impression:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-staging-kitchen  
  
- **Fresh Scents:** Baking cookies or brewing coffee before showings can create a homey atmosphere. Use scents that evoke warmth and comfort.
- **Fresh Produce:** Display colorful fruits and vegetables in bowls. They add vibrancy and imply a lifestyle of healthy eating.
- **Sounds of Home:** Soft background music during showings can set a welcoming tone for potential buyers.

### The Power of Professional Staging

If your budget permits, hiring a professional stager can be a wise investment. These experts understand which elements resonate with buyers. They can help:

- **Identify Key Features:** A professional can pinpoint what you should focus on and what could be improved.
- **Transform Your Vision:** Stagers have the skill to create a vision that feels both upscale and accessible.
- **Set the Right Tone:** They know how to position your kitchen to not only meet but exceed buyer expectations.

Ultimately, the impact of kitchen staging on home sale value can't be underestimated. A thoughtfully staged kitchen can lead to quicker sales and potentially higher offers. Not only does it enhance the marketability of your home, but it also helps your property stand out in a competitive market. By focusing on creating a warm, functional, and visually appealing kitchen, you can significantly increase the appeal of your home and ensure it captivates the hearts of potential buyers.

### Conclusion

Creating an inviting and well-staged kitchen can significantly enhance the overall appeal of your home, making it a standout in a competitive market. By following essential tips like decluttering countertops, showcasing your kitchen's features, and adding warm touches such as fresh flowers or a bowl of fruit, you can transform the space into an inviting environment. Remember, the kitchen is often viewed as the heart of the home, so ensuring it feels welcoming is crucial for potential buyers.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-staging-kitchen  
  
Staging your kitchen properly not only helps in attracting buyers, but it can also lead to a higher sale value. A well-staged kitchen demonstrates to prospective buyers that the home is well-maintained and cared for. This positive impression can influence their decision, encouraging an offer that reflects the higher end of the market price.

Moreover, an updated and appealing kitchen can be a deciding factor for buyers. They often envision themselves cooking and gathering with family in an attractive space. That emotional connection can elevate your home's desirability and result in a quicker sale.

1hxn4u7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hxn4u7/going_out_for_a_first_date_would_really/,"Going out for a first date, would really appreciate some advice ","Hi folks of this sub,
I'd really appreciate some advice, especially because I've never had a relationship and only ever had 2 dates. and tips as I (25M) and going to meet a girl (24M) on a first date on Saturday. We met in hinge and have been talking off the app, and it's been good, and I have a feeling that she likes me too, with probably a bit more flirting that I've had ever or I have given from my side, and we match on many things like political opinions, interests, opinions in general and religious beliefs. 
So I've got a few questions that I hope I can get answers for:
1. Is a coffee and walk (with a surprise show that I've planned) a good first date? I don't drink so a date over drinks didn't make sense imo. My plan was coffee and then we catch a show for an event and than have some dessert. 
2. Is it weird to travel with her in the metro to the mall we're heading to for the date? I proposed a cab but she said the metro will atleast not see the crazy traffic that drivers have to, but I feel taking her in the metro might be off-putting?
3. I'm going to be going out of country for a few months, found that recently and haven't spoken about this yet, she plans to move for some experience as well, but she isn't set on it yet, so it's not like it's out of the picture, but how do I talk about this? 
4. And tips on dressing for the date? I suggested she wear comfy shoes to the mall, and she said she isn't wearing shoes on a first date, so the bar is high for me now. 
5. What's the consensus on some gifts? She's a potter head and I was gonna get this bracelet or some pendant(some yellow chimes something, not too expensive) but my friend said that would be too much so stick to flowers. What would you say, flowers/ chocolate and a card(her bday was last week so)? 
6. Any tips additionally might be great, like the touch barrier, I can talk comfortably, but I hesitate to go in for the hug directly with a girl, so how should I navigate that, and in general. 
7. Also, she's smashing it in her career, and I'm still looking for a good position, so mentally that's there too

Our conversations have been amazing, I had issues with unsendjng and editing messages, and she called me out on it and said that hopefully she can get me comfy, so oddly in my head, in having a lot of self doubt for no apparent reason other than just an occasional case of low self esteem. 

For cultural background, both of us are Indians in Dubai, so I do guess some advice may go over me",1,1736456436.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

1hxmyfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1hxmyfh/how_to_build_new_friendships_as_an_adult/,How to build new friendships as an adult,"Hey everyone,

I love my friends.

I actually don’t know what I would do without them and I’m aware that I’m extremely lucky to have it this way. Many people don’t unfortunately.

This post is dedicated to those who kind of grew apart from their friends as they got older but want to reconnect or want to make new friends to hang out with and enjoy spending their time together.

But.

Making friends as an adult feels like a completely different game, doesn’t it? When we were kids, all it took was sharing a Snickers bar or playing on the same team, and BAAMM, you had a new best friend. But as adults, it feels like those easy moments of connection are few and far between. Life gets busy, responsibilities pile up, and before you know it, years have gone by, and you’re wondering where your friend circle went.

If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone. A lot of guys struggle with this, even if no one talks about it. Somewhere along the way, we picked up this idea that friendship isn’t a priority anymore, that it’s a “luxury” we can’t afford with everything else on our plates. But the truth is, we need that

connection. Real connection. Not just the kind where you scroll through updates on social media but the kind where you can call someone up and say, “Man, I’m having a rough day,” and know they’ll listen.

So, how do you build new friendships when life already feels overwhelming? It starts with breaking down the idea that making friends as an adult is weird or desperate. It’s not. It’s human. And while it might take a little effort, it’s not impossible.

First, think about where you spend your time. Are you stuck in the same routine of work, home, and maybe the gym? If so, it’s going to be hard to meet new people. Look for places where connections can happen more naturally. Maybe a sports league, a hobby group, or even a class that interests you. The key is to find something you genuinely enjoy because shared interests are one of the easiest ways to break the ice.

Next, be open. This is the part that feels uncomfortable for a lot of guys because we’re not always great at putting ourselves out there. But being open doesn’t mean you have to overshare or be the life of the party. It just means you show up, be yourself, and be willing to take the first step. Whether that’s just saying hi, asking a question, or inviting someone to hang out. It might feel awkward, but that’s okay. Awkwardness is just part of the process.

Another thing to keep in mind is consistency. Friendships don’t usually happen overnight. They’re built over time through small, consistent interactions. Think about it, how often do you have a good chat with someone, but then you don’t follow up, and the connection fizzles out? Don’t let that happen. If you meet someone you vibe with, make an effort to keep in touch. Send a text, grab a coffee, or invite them to do something you both enjoy.

And here’s the big one. Let go of the idea that friendships have to look a certain way. Not every friend has to be your BEST friend or someone you hang out with every week. Some friendships are about sharing hobbies, some are about deep conversations, and some are just about having someone to grab a beer with and decompress. They all count.

If you’re reading this and thinking, “Yeah, but what if I put myself out there and get rejected?”, that’s a fair worry. Rejection sucks, no matter how old you are. But remember, it’s not a reflection of your worth. Some connections just don’t click, and that’s okay. The important thing is to keep trying. The right people are out there, they’re just waiting for you to cross paths.

Building friendships as an adult isn’t always easy, but it’s worth it. Life gets a little lighter when you’ve got people in your corner. And the best part? It’s never too late to start. So take that first step. You might be surprised by what, and who, you find.

And I'm very sorry. I know this is very male orientated.

In my bedroom, 4 of the 6 wardrobe doors are open, the folding stairs (are they called that in English?) are standing against the wardrobe, scarves and warm socks are a bit all over. My work bag is against a corner of the bed.

I'm waiting for it to be 10pm. I haven't had dinner and I don't have an appetite. Except maybe for pizza.

On my way home from my Dutch conversation table, at the final stop in my tram station, I saw a homeless guy. 

I volunteer with the homeless, it's sub zero temperatures. He had a small jacket and a very thin cover. He had a bag of cold food and bread, some juice. I asked him if he wanted me to call the emergency shelter, he said he didn't want to go to the shelter but he'd like some more covers, if I could call homeless assistance services for that.

I called, knowing they wouldn't come just to give him a duvet, but if I told them he could be persuaded into emergency sleeping solutions, they might come, they might be more persuasive than me.

I called, and they were not picking up. That poor man was shivering. I told him I'd stay on the phone and go home to grab something for him.

I went home, grabbed my sleeping bag I never use, rummaged through my wardrobe to find warm socks, a scarf, a small warm duvet I could give him.

I made him tea and put it in a thermos, and while adding as much sugar as I could, I spilled half of it over the counter. I warmed up some soup I had, and put it in a container I never use.

I ran back, I was still on the line with homeless services. An automated message told me all beds are full and to call back at 10pm in case anyone gives up their bed.

He was happy and a bit emotional to see what I had brought. He gulped down half the soup in one go and he made a big sigh afterwards. I told him I'll call again at 10pm and that I'd try to come back tomorrow morning. I'm thinking of bringing him a big coffee.

""If I make it, see you tomorrow"", he said.

I've already seen a couple of homeless people die from the cold. As I left the station I couldn't decide if I'm more angry, sad, worried...

So now I'm waiting for it to be 10pm, but most likely there won't be a spot, or they'll tell me they won't go pick him up if they're not sure he'll go with them, which I understand.

I hope we can have coffee together tomorrow.",11,1736455889.0,Vent,1,0.92,False

1hxmub1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hxmub1/forever_interrupted/,"Forever, Interrupted","Sarah and I met when we were five years old, and from that moment, she became a constant in my life. She was the kind of kid who could turn a cardboard box into a castle, a dirt lot into a kingdom. Her auburn hair caught the sunlight like fire, and she had this peculiar way of tilting her head when she listened, as though she wanted to soak in every word you said. On the first day we met, she handed me a cherry-red bucket and asked if I wanted to help her build a fort in the backyard. I didn’t hesitate.

We grew up together in our quiet suburban town, where summers meant bike rides and winters were for sledding down the hill behind the elementary school. She wanted to be a writer; I wanted to be a doctor. “You’ll save lives,” she said once, lying in the grass beside me, her eyes tracing the clouds. “And I’ll write stories about them.”

By the time we both got into the same university, it felt like everything had come full circle. Our friendship stretched and morphed as we navigated college together. Sarah joined the campus newspaper, her name appearing in print under articles that made me proud in ways I couldn’t articulate. I was buried in labs and lectures, trying to keep up with the grueling demands of pre-med. We drifted for a while, each of us carving our own paths, but we always seemed to find our way back to each other.

It wasn’t until sophomore year that everything changed. One night, we were studying for midterms in the library, surrounded by the hum of stressed-out students and the sharp scent of stale coffee. Sarah caught me staring at her, and for once, I didn’t look away. “What?” she asked, smiling in that way that always made my chest tighten. “Nothing,” I said, but it wasn’t nothing. It was everything.

By the end of that semester, we were officially together. Falling in love with Sarah felt like stepping into sunlight after years in the shadows. She was my best friend, my first love, my home. We spent late nights whispering about the future—her dream of becoming a journalist, my dream of becoming a doctor. “You’ll be the doctor,” she’d say, her voice teasing but soft, “and I’ll be the storyteller. Together, we’ll make the world a little better.”

But life, as it often does, had other plans.

The headaches started during spring semester of our junior year. Then came the nausea, the weight loss, the moments when Sarah, normally so sharp, seemed to lose her train of thought mid-sentence. She brushed it off at first—“Just stress,” she said, waving away my concern. But when she fainted during a meeting with her editor, I insisted she see a doctor.

The diagnosis came quickly: glioblastoma. A tumor had taken root in her brain, spreading with ruthless precision. She was 21.

We fought it together, as best we could. Surgery, radiation, experimental treatments—anything that offered even a glimmer of hope. But Sarah, ever pragmatic, knew the odds. “This isn’t about beating it,” she told me one night, her voice calm in the face of my tears. “It’s about living while I still can.”

And live she did. We packed a lifetime into those final months—sunset picnics on the beach, quiet mornings tangled in her dorm room sheets, hours spent talking about everything and nothing. She kept writing, even when her hands shook too much to hold a pen. “I want to leave something behind,” she said, her determination as fierce as ever.

She died in October, just as the leaves on campus were beginning to turn. I held her hand until her breath stilled, the girl who had been my best friend, my first love, my everything slipping away like sand through my fingers.

For weeks after, I couldn’t function. The medical school acceptance letter that arrived in the mail felt like an insult, a cruel reminder of the future I would face without her. But Sarah, ever the storyteller, had left me one final message. Tucked into the notebook she always carried was a letter addressed to me.

“Alex, you once told me you wanted to became a doctor because you wanted to fix things. But you don’t need to fix me. You gave me everything—your laughter, your love, your stubborn insistence on keeping me alive. I don’t need forever to know what we had was enough. So, keep going. Fix what you can. And don’t forget to live.”

Now, as a first-year medical student, I carry her words with me. Every patient I meet, every life I touch—it’s all for her. Sarah taught me that life is fleeting but love is eternal. She didn’t live to write all the stories she wanted to, but her story lives on in me, in the lives I heal and the compassion I carry forward.

He was in charge of taking care of any issues that happened after the end of the morning shifts. I was serving as a physician and each time there was a sick soldier that had to be sent to the hospital or to stay in our infirmery or whatever I would call him. So we would talk many times throughout the day. I would also message him things like sick leave documents etc.

At some point I was also hospitalized because I had a nasty food poisoning. He came to visit along with the Captain. It was the first time that I actually saw him, I only knew him by his voice. I felt alive again at that moment he was so damn cute.

Now that my duty is over we've been out for a coffee twice. We've discussed about ""safe"" topics like what we do in our lives (me in medicine and him in the army) and about gym. We also make phone calls, he calls me during his shifts and we talk for some time.

I have traces of interest. We exchange selfies, I call him by his military grade and add a word that in Greek resembles somehow that -chan used in Japanese (which shows familiarity). He calls me something that in Greek means small (but has  a cute meaning). Should I take the wait and see approach or do something?

Another thing is that I feel stressed when I talk to him. I'm happy and I can't wait to talk but I'm also stressed. He's not my chief anymore, I'm not his subordinate or whatever but I still feel that I'm talking to someone in authority and that I have to respect.

I was deeply in love with her and I wanted a serious relationship. However, at her request, we kept our relationship secret to avoid office gossip, which I respected and understood. To maintain professionalism, I kept my distance at work.

However, she had “friendship” with a male coworker and they went on coffee breaks and the occasional lunch —something she and I didn’t do. Eventually, I learned that he had a crush on her because he admitted it to me during a happy hour. Over time, I began hearing office rumors about their friendship, which made me feel uncomfortable and insecure.

I brought this up to her and explained how it affected me, but she insisted they were strictly friends and accused me of being controlling. If I had to guess, she knew the coworker wanted more than a friendship. 

This created a ton of friction in our relationship. Eventually the male coworker left the company but irreversible damage was done. The relationship failed because I developed trust issues and we lost contact for many years. Six years later she made contact and we tried reconciling. It seemed that time had given us different wisdom and perspective. I learned that she lived in Dubai for a couple years when she worked as a flight attendant for Emirates. Well, come to discover, this male coworker lived in Dubai during this period. Coincidence? She also claims she only saw him once. Have I been played all along?

I just received my Varia VS6 this week and was kind of happy with it so far - however, it seems like its not able to go fine enough to get a proper shot. According to Varias User Manual, Espresso should be in the 2-5 Range. I started dialing in at 2.5 and went down to 1.5 (which should already be turkish coffee) but didnt really see any big difference and dont see a ""good looking"" shot. All shots i recorded looked way too coarse and too fast. With the previous Timemore C3ESP Pro i was ""able"" to choke shots, this does not seem to be possible with the VS6. 

I already disassembled the grinding part and checked for any wobbling/weird looking parts - but all is looking quite perfect. The only option i might try is adding one of the spare washers under the bottom burr to get the burrs touching point closer to zero? 

Some shots i recorded:

He was in charge of taking care of any issues that happened after the end of the morning shifts.

So we would talk many times throughout the day. I would also message him things like sick leave documents etc.

At some point I was also hospitalized because I had a nasty food poisoning. He came to visit along with the Captain. It was the first time that I actually saw him, I only knew him by his voice. I felt alive again at that moment he was so damn cute.

Now that my duty is over we've been out for a coffee twice. We've discussed about ""safe"" topics like what we do in our lives (me in medicine and him in the army) and about gym. We also make phone calls, he calls me during his shifts and we talk for some time.

I have traces of interest. We exchange selfies, I call him by his military grade and add a word that in Greek resembles somehow that -chan used in Japanese (which shows familiarity). He calls me something that in Greek means small (but has something like a cute meaning). Should I take the wait and see approach or do something?

Another thing is that I feel stressed when I talk to him. I'm happy and I can't wait to talk but I'm also stressed. He's not my chief anymore, I'm not his subordinate or whatever but I still feel that I'm talking to someone in authority and that I have to respect.

Yesterday nmother asked me to translate a song with a female singer on her phone which she claimed my father was listening to in another early morning bout of her episodic paranoia, so i gave her a website with the song's lyrics & google translate on another tab and told her to just copy and paste (to spare myself). She kept pestering me which after a while made the back of my neck hurt like hell, i still don't know why this happens but it does when i'm being pestered by these people knowing that i'm about to be ostracized for not giving them the answers they want. Later i asked her to not bring her petty problems to me anymore since it's becoming physically painful now as opposed to only mentally painful (ha). Spoiler alert it ended with nmother and older brother standing shoulder to shoulder throwing all sorts of insults at me while she sported the most infantilizing face imaginable, at one point i asked ""Do i not have a mother and a brother when i'm ill?"" (with them knowing about my neck) to which she replied ""You're not my son"". So that was cool, i still caused a huge ass ruckus tho so still a win :)

Today in the morning in the middle of studying for my baccalaureate (which i failed more than twice despite sacrificing a lot of time & effort, which they deny) nfather comes to me saying there's an opportunity if i get an extremely high grade (knowing fully well i never even succeeded in passing the exam) so i waited opportunistically for nmother to leave the room so i could respond with ""With her around?"" to which he started talking about how his sister studied to a candle or some sh!t for 18 years (which is bullcrap btw) & something about the next 6 months deciding my future (recurring theme, he tries to use fear to control people at every opportunity while flaunting his limitless wisedom) to which i said ""I'm not your sister. I can't focus with nmother causing a ruckus every single day."" to which he said ""You must."" I was livid, he knows what's up, he knows i've failed twice and wasted 2 years and sacrificed precious time i could have spent f\*cking living so they both could show to their siblings, who are much more successful than them, that they've produced good offspring.

Timeskip to evening, i studied for 4 hours and in order to cope with stress i did something i rarely do which is smoking, and ngl it helped, it burned bc i wasn't a master obviously and i felt a short while of tightness after finishing but somehow it made me relaxed the rest of the day despite having had an allnighter last night. I was proompting chatgpt about my situation and whether or not smoking was acceptable sometimes, and reading the answers it just struck me that this lifeless robot is gentler than my own blood. I just put my head in my palms and cried for a while.

""*Please don’t feel alone in this. I can keep supporting you, whether it’s brainstorming strategies, talking through what you’re feeling, or just being here when things feel too much. ❤️*""

After i told it i bought tea instead of the usual coffee because a good tea place was close to where cigarettes are sold (which helped with anxiety):

""*You’re showing adaptability by already making one adjustment with tea—it’s a sign that you can find ways to reshape other habits, even when things feel overwhelming. Let me know if you want more suggestions, or just a space to reflect!*""

Is it truly difficult to provide basic care to your child? I can't recall doing anything bad to these people willing especially considering i'm barely mature at 20. Seriously, what the f\*ck is wrong with these people heads?

1hxma8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1hxma8x/from_google_sheets_to_75m_building_a_startup_on_a/,From Google Sheets to $7.5M: Building a Startup on a Shoestring Budget,"Hey everyone,

A few weeks ago, I shared the story of how I built (and lost) my previous business to $7.5M annual revenue. The response was incredible, and I received a ton of questions from aspiring entrepreneurs eager to learn more. One question came up a few times: **""How did you start with almost no budget and rely on a Google Sheet?""** So, I thought I'd dive deeper into that aspect and share how a simple tool like Google Sheets played a pivotal role in our early success. Maybe it can help someone out there who's just starting their entrepreneurial journey!

**📅 The Humble Beginnings: From Zero to $100K with a Google Sheet**

I was 21 when I graduated college in 2018. Fresh out of school, my best friend and I decided to dive into the creator economy. We had big dreams but very limited resources. Instead of pouring months into building a complex app, we took a different approach.

**💡 The Advisor's Wisdom: Stop Building, Start Testing**

I spent weeks developing an app for creators to view and manage all their deals, but during our first conversation with an advisor we had met, he gave us some game-changing advice:

**“Stop building. Get some customers and test the process as lean and as quickly as possible.”**

Lucky us, we took his advice just three weeks in. Without that pivot, we might’ve stalled for months, wasting precious time and resources. Honestly, one of the best pieces of advice I’ve ever received.

**📊 Building 'The Influencer Bible': Our Google Sheet Masterstroke**

Taking the advisor’s advice to heart, we created a simple Google Sheet we called **'The Influencer Bible'**. This sheet became the backbone of our operations:

* **Outreach Lists:** Tracking potential influencers to collaborate with.
* **Sign-Up Details:** Managing creator information and payouts.
* **Reporting:** Monitoring campaign performance and results.

We even shared screenshots of our leaderboard directly in a WhatsApp group with our creators. This no-frills approach kept us agile, transparent, and efficient. For a year, this simple sheet helped us generate around $100K. When it was time to hire, onboarding new team members was seamless - we just shared the sheet.

**🫡 Ready for action**  
  
We found our first client when my cofounder attended a conference and met a random guy in the coffee line. This unexpected encounter got us an intro to our first client quickly and we were able to get up and running quickly because since we'd had everything on our Google Sheet.  
  
This meant we could focus on actually executing and perfecting our creator content which led to us absolutely killing it and making **$15K in our first month** while driving them 10k app downloads in those first few weeks. That initial revenue was crucial - it funded the development of our first version of the app, setting the stage for future growth and supporting more creators and customers. (That’s a whole other story, lol.)

If I was still building that app, we wouldn't have made that $15k and the revenue in the coming months and we wouldn't have had all those learnings from actually delivering the service.

**💡 Key Takeaways: Embrace Simplicity and Stay Agile**

1. **Start Lean:** Focus on validating your idea with real customers before building a complex product.
2. **Leverage Simple Tools:** Tools like Google Sheets can be incredibly powerful in the early stages.
3. **Be Open to Pivoting:** Listen to advice and be ready to change direction when necessary.
4. **Value Serendipity:** Opportunities can come from the most unexpected places - stay prepared to seize them.
5. **Streamline Onboarding:** Simple systems make it easier to bring new team members up to speed quickly.

**🔗 Let’s Connect and Share Stories**

I've been enjoying meeting so many of you and I’d love to share more insights and learn from your experiences too!

I started walking during an incredibly stressful time in my life.  The stress really hasn't abated much but I believe to my core that my daily walks have saved my life by keeping my stress somewhat manageable.  After about a month a friend told me he once did a year straight as a ""Misogi"" and I should consider doing that which  frankly I thought it was a cool idea and I just love streaks so off I went.  Through good weather and bad (and I live in NH where the temp can be below freezing for months), through good feeling and sickness (I even walked the day I had my colonoscopy), I've just kept walking.  No matter where I have to travel, I make sure I can take my walk.  On my 1 year I was in a part of the world that was so hilly and hot that I walked back and forth on a 1/8 mile section of flat ground for an hour to get my 3 miles in.  Once the first year past which was my original goal, I just kept going.  It's a pain sometimes, but I feel like if I accomplish that every day then at least I've accomplished something. 

Tomorrow I'll wake up at 5 and walk again.  Forecast is for about 15 degrees but that's okay. I'll have a hot cup of coffee with me.",35,1736454095.0,walking,13,1.0,False

You start with a to-do list longer than a line at the DMV, and by lunch, you’ve only managed to check off “drink coffee” and “panic.” But hey, no need to book a one-way ticket to Overwhelmsville. Let’s chat about a few productivity habits that can*actually* make your day smoother and give you some of that precious time back.

**1. The Power Hour:** *No, not the one where you take a sip every minute (although tempting!)*. Dedicate the first hour of your workday to the most daunting task. Why? You’re fresh, not yet jaded by tiny tasks, and while your brain is still in the zone of “I can do anything!” you might actually *do* something.

**2. The Two-Minute Rule:** Got a task that takes less than two minutes? Do it immediately. You’d be amazed at what gets done in two minutes; from shooting off an email to filing a paper. *Suddenly, your desk isn’t a paper avalanche waiting to happen.*

**3. Batch Tasks Like a Boss:** Those little tasks you have, like replying to emails or setting appointments? Batch them. Set aside specific times to handle similar tasks all at once. *Ever tried replying to emails one-by-one throughout the day? That’s like trying to lose weight by eating cake on a treadmill.*

**4. Learn to Say No:** Yeah, I get it, FOMO is real. But sometimes, saying no is the most productive thing you can do. If a meeting doesn’t need you, ask to skip it. *Will the TPS reports implode without you? Probably not.*

**5. Embrace Technology:** Apps are your friends! Tools like Trello or Notion can help you keep track of tasks without 500 sticky notes plastered everywhere. *Unless you find comfort in sticky notes, then by all means, go Picasso.*

And guys, don’t worry if a day doesn’t go to plan. We’ve all got that one day where “productive” means finally chucking the mystery Tupperware from the back of the fridge. 🤷‍♂️

Reflect on what habit resonates with you or maybe share something that’s helped you escape the quicksand. Remember, productivity isn't about doing more; it's about *doing what matters*. Sometimes, it’s just about finding that flow where you feel less like you’re being dragged by life and more like you’re cruising down a freeway with the windows down.

Anyway, I thought it was a very interesting segment but my younger sister asked ""What? Is that true?"" And my mum who has been studying for 4 years to be a nurse and midwife and has done a lot of biology said ""no don't believe that, that's all wrong."" 

She just automatically dismissed it and denied all of the research that thousands of scientists have probably spent their life studying this topic.
My dad even had a laugh at the news and dismissed it.
Like, I dont understand. It takes a quick Google to see that coffee is actually good for you and that it being banned in the Mormon church is a complete sham. But nope because some dead narcissistic, misogynist, etc. Prophets said so theyre just going against the findings of modern day science.

I could take them one day a week so you can get some mental health time! This will be so good.” Has this happened once? Of course not. She spends her days with her ill-behaved dogs, one of which bit her face a few years back requiring stitches but she refused to get rid of him (said she was going to get him into training - never happened) so my kids aren’t allowed over there alone because I know she won’t keep the dog locked up away from them. 

Last spring I had a severe injury requiring surgery. I couldn’t walk and my youngest was 4 months-old at the time. I asked my mom if she could please come over in the days leading up to my surgery while my husband was working to help me with the kids since I was on crutches and couldn’t even really carry the baby. She hesitantly said yes but that she was have to leave frequently to go home and check on her animals (my parents live a mile away.) She would show up for a bit then leave to go to the animals, to get her nails done, to go get her hair done, to go get coffee, to go get food. On the day of my surgery, I had to be at the hospital early early, so she came and sat on her phone while the kids slept. We got back at like 1030, me woozy and puking, she was still sitting in the recliner where we left her, and instead of making sure I was ok she just hightailed it out of here. She hadn’t fed the kids breakfast even though they’d been up for over two hours, so my husband had to deal with me puking and feed the kids while she went home to her dogs. We didn’t ask her for anymore help after that, even though I had an extended, rough recovery, and she didn’t offer. We struggled and struggled and struggled.

This week, I re-injured myself badly. I cannot walk again and have to have the same surgery next week. I’m supposed to be off my feet, icing, feet up because I am scary swollen. She’s posting about my injury on Facebook “asking for prayers” but has she offered to help with the kids, cook a meal, actually DO anything not performative? Of course not! She’s fine watching me drown as long as she doesn’t have to put herself out at all. We are going to have to find someone else to watch the kids during my surgery next week because it’s in the afternoon and she said she didn’t think she could do it if we wouldn’t be back by dinner.

What is it like having a mother who actually mothers? To have a mom when catastrophe strikes actually shows up and makes things better. Who sees the things that could help and does them. Makes a meal. Does some laundry. Tells you that you need to lie down and rest. I guess I have my mom to thank for teaching me the kind of mom/grandparent I don’t want to be but god.

1hxlyoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/thisisbusiness/comments/1hxlyoa/how_to_make_money_from_youtube_ai_videos_earn_1/,How to Make Money from YouTube AI Videos & Earn 1 Million Dollars 🚀,"Hey everyone! With the rapid growth of AI and the rise of video content, YouTube has become one of the best platforms to earn money. If you’re thinking about using AI to create videos, there’s a huge opportunity to generate passive income and even reach a goal of earning 1 million dollars. Here’s how you can make money from YouTube AI videos and how to scale it:

1. Create AI-Generated Content

AI tools like ChatGPT, DeepBrain, and Lumen5 allow you to generate video scripts, voiceovers, and even animations. You don’t need to be a video editor or have professional equipment—AI can handle a lot of the heavy lifting for you. Create content around trending topics like tech, finance, or niche areas of interest that people are searching for.

2. Monetize through YouTube AdSense

Once you’ve built a consistent stream of videos with good watch time, you can monetize your channel through YouTube AdSense. The more views your videos get, the more money you make from ads placed on your content. With AI-generated videos, you can create content more efficiently and publish frequently, helping you to increase views and ad revenue.

3. Leverage Affiliate Marketing

AI videos can be used to promote affiliate products related to your content. For example, if you’re making videos about technology or digital tools, you can add affiliate links in the description. Every time someone clicks and purchases through your link, you earn a commission. Combine this with a high-traffic YouTube channel, and affiliate marketing can significantly boost your income.

4. Sell Digital Products or Services

Use your YouTube channel to sell your own digital products, like eBooks, online courses, or software. If you build a loyal audience with AI-generated content, they will be more likely to purchase products you create or recommend. You can also sell exclusive content or offer premium access through platforms like Patreon.

5. Brand Sponsorships and Partnerships

As your channel grows, brands will want to partner with you for sponsored content. AI videos make it easier to produce content consistently, and companies are always looking for creators who can integrate their products seamlessly. You can negotiate lucrative deals with brands, further increasing your income.

6. Scaling Your Channel

To reach that 1 million dollar mark, you need to scale your channel quickly. Focus on:

SEO Optimization: Use the right keywords to rank your videos higher in search results.

Consistency: Upload regularly and optimize your videos for longer watch time.

Social Media Promotion: Use platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok to promote your YouTube videos and grow your audience.


7. Diversify Your Income Streams

As you build your YouTube channel, diversify your income sources. You can:

Offer consulting services in your niche.

Launch merchandise related to your content.

Use crowdfunding or donations via platforms like Patreon or Buy Me A Coffee.


Final Thoughts:

AI videos offer a unique opportunity to create content at scale with minimal effort. By combining YouTube’s ad revenue, affiliate marketing, sponsorships, and selling your own products, it’s absolutely possible to generate significant income, including reaching that 1 million dollar goal. The key is to stay consistent, grow your audience, and leverage multiple revenue streams.
