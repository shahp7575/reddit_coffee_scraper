I'm really in the mood for some blackberries (they've invaded the land and my tastebuds 🥲). The area I knew best for blackberries in West Seattle got pulled up before the summer so I've been on the hunt for a new patch. You can even DM me a spot, I promise to not blow up your blackberry spot and only take what I can eat lol. Bonus points if it's closeish to Olympia Coffee. ",1,1755749484.0,WestSeattleWA,0,1.0,False

1mw0whk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/1mw0whk/previous_treatment_no_longer_working_at_a_loss/,Previous treatment no longer working - At a loss,"I need help. I'm not getting anywhere quick with my doctor and the things I used to manage my symptoms in the past aren't working. I'm starting to get at a loss and am just not sure what might be happening in my body. 

I am not officially diagnosed with HI (I was sent to an allergist who told me I was fine), but I suspect something in that category. My main current symptoms are constant: sneezing, stuffed/runny nose, brain fog, and fatigue. In the past, I've dealt with migraines, rashes, heart palpitations, stomach pain, itchiness, TMJ pain, and digestive problems. 

  
2 years ago I was treated by my naturopath for the allergy symptoms by taking quercetin and stinging nettle daily for 9 months (saw improvement after 3 weeks), donating blood (I have high iron), probiotic, and reducing stress. Over a few months my symptoms pretty much went away entirely except I had begun to have really bad digestion/bloating and having frequent and very loose bowel movements. This was not normal for me. 

Now, my digestion has almost completely improved (I'm not sure why), but my allergy symptoms are back and worse than they have ever been. I think I've had 33 days in a row of these sneezing episodes where I sneeze 20-25 times in a minute or two several times per day, constant fatigue, and intense brain fog. I'm calling in sick so often cause I can barely function like this. 

I started the same protocols I did 2 years ago when it was really bad.... but so far it has done nothing, and my symptoms feel like they are getting worse. I'm trying to see my doctor again, but feeling quite hopeless as I was really brushed off in the past. 

In terms of my diet, a typical day looks like: coffee & oat milk + maple syrup, oatmeal with chia seeds, butter/fruit/berries, maybe a scoop of greek yogurt, or some turkey sausages and toast, or a hash with potatoes/veggies. My other meals typically are protein, veggies, and some carb (rice/potatoes). I eat pretty simple foods, and try to cook at home often. I've started to introduce dairy a bit more this year- it used to give me rashes but I notice my skin/stomach has been handling it fine. 

Here is what I know so far:

\- Foods like bone broth, collagen, red wine, avocados, egg whites, and corn seem to make things worse 

\- Stress makes things worse always

\- I did an elimination diet for gluten and didn't notice any change

\- I have not found an anti-histamine that makes any difference for me, and I've tried all the ones available to me. I've also tried taking Pepcid with the anti-histamine and I didn't notice any changes. This is where I get confused if my symptoms could be HI, as it doesn't seem that anti-histamines have any effect. 

\- I have been taking a over the counter medicated decongestant nasal spray (Otrivin) almost daily before bed. I know this is bad. When I lay down to sleep, my sinuses completely plug up and its nearly impossible to sleep without something to open my air passages. I've started taking Flonase to see if it will help to ween off of Otrivin, and I am trying to only use it on one nostril to allow the other one to detox from it, then I'll stop on both. 

\- I have elevated iron levels (not enough for a hemochromatosis diagnosis, but higher than normal at 175) so I have given blood to reduce this number

\- I've removed all scented things from my life, gone to natural products on my body and household for a few years

\- I have an IUD because I had bad periods (I read some connection between endo and HI? I'm not dx endo, but anything feels like a possibility rn)

\- I have a family history of psoriasis 

I am otherwise very healthy to my knowledge. I recently finished grad school and thought maybe the stress of that was contributing, but my symptoms have not reduced. I've considered taking a fluconazole to see if that could make a difference (had a friend where one dose of that cured their MCAS). But I am just so discouraged and feeling very lost. 

I guess I'm sharing this incase there are any big red flags for HI that I am missing, or obvious things I should/shouldn't be doing based on my symptoms? Or maybe just looking for validation that these symptoms aren't random and could indicate something HI. If anyone has insight, advice, or things to try, I would appreciate that so much. 

I'm really discouraged that what helped me before does not seem to be working (6 weeks later), and feel like I'm back at square one. I feel like for my whole life I've had symptoms trade off and never really had a period where I felt normal. I can barely function in my life, and am getting more and more hopeless. 

Thank you for your kindness, support, and insight. Happy to answer any questions or provide more information. I appreciate this a lot.

1mw0wgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1mw0wgo/haven/,Haven,"I like to explore places I'm not supposed to. Abandoned malls, schools condemned because of asbestos poisonings, and once the Saint Louis Zoo at night while on a trip with an explorer buddy (not much to see really, and the security there is really good at their job). The reason I do it is to capture the perfect stillness. It's the beauty found in an abandoned food court, a space that was once a noisy tide of people clamoring for pretzels and smoothies. Now, it’s a still, hollow mausoleum of dust, and the only food being eaten is a roach that a rat happened to snag in the corner near the remnants of a Taco Bell. The silence here isn't just an absence of sound. It's a heavy, breathing presence, a memory so profound it has become a living thing, a testament to the life that once filled this hollow space. The zoo happened because I just really wanted a picture of a tiger at night. Looking back, I'm not sure how I would have done that at night without a flash.

There's a fair amount of risk when exploring these abandoned locations. I'm always on the lookout for security guards and homeless crackheads. The building itself could be about to crumble with age, making it sketchy to walk the different levels. But every explorer hopes for one thing: to be the first to uncover a forgotten place. It's like finding a secret. The air is…different. When you step inside, you're not just crossing a threshold; you're entering into a perfect, still moment. It's a strange kind of ownership. This space, once vibrant with the lives of hundreds of people, now belongs only to you. For a moment, you are the sole witness to its elegant decay. You see the light filter through a broken window onto an old chair, and you can almost hear the conversation that was had there years ago. Every dusty object tells a story of a life that went on without you, a history that you are the first to finally see. There's a melancholic beauty in it—a feeling of both discovery and profound loss. You're an archaeologist of the recent past, and this is your quiet, sacred find. Some things should never be found.

It was a typical Wednesday afternoon. My shift at the local grocery store started at 6 a.m. and ended at 3 p.m. I left through the automatic doors, passing the same large lettering above the exit that read, “And as Always, Thank You for Shopping with Us! Bye!” It was a phrase I’d seen for three years straight. The “JULIAN” on my nametag almost entirely worn off, leaving me with most of an L and the rest the best my handwriting and permanent marker can produce. Hall and Oates’ “Maneater” was playing when I came to a detour sign on my street. Frustrated, I then remembered the signs I’d seen earlier this week saying construction was starting today. I also remembered telling myself to take the back way home and not to forget. “I should probably lay off the pen for a while,” I mumbled to myself.

I followed the detour for an obnoxious amount of time, profaning with every new orange sign I saw. I did see a mint, cherry-red '67 Camaro sitting in someone's driveway, so hey, upside. Eventually, though, a new problem emerged. Driving through some residential development, I came to a T-junction with no detour sign. I eased my car forward, squinting to see if the next sign was hiding around a corner. I scanned both sides of the road and, to my dismay, saw nothing. I gambled on a left turn—I’m a lefty after all—and kept my eyes peeled for that orange rectangle I’d been cursing earlier. After what felt like an eternity of signless turns, I did a U-turn, went back the way I came, and continued forward in search of the elusive sign.

The detour signs had become a cruel joke. After turning back, I drove for another ten minutes, my frustration mounting with every empty intersection. Just as I was about to give up and check my phone for a signal, I rounded a gentle curve and saw a turn I hadn't noticed before. It wasn't marked and didn't have a name or a sign, just a quiet, unassuming lane that cut through a thick line of trees. I took the turn, more out of desperation than curiosity. The road was old and paved but covered in a fine layer of dust, as if it hadn't been driven on in years. The trees on either side stood so close together their branches formed a canopy, giving the whole place a hushed, twilight feel. After a couple of minutes, the woods opened up, and I saw it.

There was a town.

It wasn't a sprawling place, just a few dozen houses, a general store, and what looked like a small town hall. They weren't overgrown with weeds or covered in graffiti. They were perfectly preserved. The paint on the houses looked fresh, the lawns were trimmed, and a lone flagpole stood at the center of the town square, its rope hanging perfectly still. There wasn't a single car on the street or a person in sight. It was like I had driven off the map and into a photograph. The frustration of getting lost vanished, replaced by an intoxicating sense of discovery. I found it. The perfect stillness I’d always looked for. I had found my sacred, untouched place.

I cut the engine and sat in my car, staring at the perfect stillness. It was so quiet I could hear the ringing in my own ears. I finally got out, my boots crunching on the dusty asphalt. The sound felt sacrilegious, a betrayal of the silence. I took a deep breath, expecting the stale air of a forgotten place, but it was fresh and clean, carrying only the scent of pine. I walked down the main street, passing houses with curtains perfectly drawn and porches with rocking chairs sitting as if they were just waiting for a visitor. I took my phone out to take a picture, noting that I had no connection whatsoever. I headed for the general store, its red and white paint looking as if it had been applied yesterday. The sign on the door read “OPEN.” I pulled on the door handle, and to my surprise, it gave way easily, the lock already broken.

The air inside was cool and still. Cans of soup, bags of chips, and cartons of milk sat on the shelves, their labels crisp and bright, but a thick layer of dust covered everything. There was no visible decay, not a single rodent or insect in sight. The space was a perfect replica of a store, just frozen in time. I walked down an aisle, brushing my hand along a shelf, sending dust particles dancing in a beam of light from the broken window. At the counter, a glass jar was filled with what looked like pickled eggs, their cloudy liquid now settled into a murky brine.

I walked behind the counter and found a calendar hanging on the wall. It was dated January 1985. The pages were a little yellowed but otherwise perfect. Oddly, the last page torn off was for December 1984. Yes, before you ask, I did check the till; all that was there was a couple oxidized pennies and a few rotted-through rubber bands.

After the general store, I wandered deeper into the town, my sense of wonder only growing. The streets were perfectly clean, a testament to a forgotten time when someone must have cared a lot about this place.

I walked a block further and found the town's school, a small brick building with a playground out front. A red kickball sat in the middle of a perfectly preserved four-square court, as if it had been abandoned mid-game. I pushed open the unlocked door. Inside, the air was heavy with the smell of old paper and wood. In one classroom, I found a chalkboard with a single, perfectly written phrase in chalk: ""Final Exam."" The desks were all in neat rows, and on one of them was a half-finished essay about the state of the union, dated 1984.

The coolest find, though, was the movie theater. The marquee above the door was blank, but the posters in the display cases were vivid and bright, advertising movies from the 80s that I knew by heart. The box office window was open, and I stepped through into the lobby. A popcorn machine sat silent behind the counter, a single, unpopped kernel resting on the dusty surface.

I walked into the main auditorium, my footsteps echoing in the dark. The seats were worn but unbroken. I made my way to the front and looked up at the screen. That's when I felt it. A sudden, deep chill ran through me, as if a window had just opened in the dead of winter. But there were no open windows. I also heard a faint, low-pitched hum so faint I thought it was just the ringing in my ears. I dismissed it as a power line or something outside, but the feeling lingered, a subtle prickle on the back of my neck. I quickly took a picture of the dusty theater before heading out into the afternoon light.

I drove out of the town the same way I came in. My phone pinged with multiple notifications as it connected back to life. I checked the time, and it was now 9pm. But that can’t be possible. I only drove for an hour, and I was in town for two hours max. So the latest it should be is around 6pm. I chalked it up to time moving fast while having fun and carried on home. That wasn't it, though. I saw the same Camaro from earlier, but the detour signs were all gone. Even the signs near my work that led me to the town were gone too. As if they were never there in the first place.

I got home, and the first thing I did was call my best friend and fellow urban explorer, Luke. ""Dude, you're not going to believe what just happened to me,"" I said, my voice shaking with a mix of excitement and disbelief. ""It's an entire town, completely preserved. Like, a perfect time capsule from the '80s. No one's been there, no graffiti, nothing. You would have loved it.""

Luke listened quietly, then asked, ""What are you talking about? Where is it? A place like that would be all over the urbex forums.""

I explained how I found it. The strange detour signs that vanished, the road that appeared out of nowhere. Luke was silent for a moment before saying, ""Wait, what detour are you talking about? I didn’t see any construction when I passed by your house today.""

I told him I'd show him the pictures I took. I pulled up my phone's camera roll and scrolled through the photos, but nothing was there. The photos of the town, the school, and the movie theater were all gone. Being replaced by blurry, corrupted files. I kept scrolling, more and more frantic, but they were all just static. ""Dude, are you alright?"" Luke's voice was filled with concern. ""You sound really out of it. Maybe you had a few too many pen rips.” I told him I was fine and hung up. I sat there in silence, staring at my blank screen.

I woke up the next morning and immediately called in sick to the grocery store. I had a mission, and no amount of responsibility was going to keep me from it. Pulling up Google Maps on my laptop, I retraced my path from yesterday, following the exact route the detour took me. The roads were all there, just as I remembered, but there was no turn-off, no road leading to the town. Frustrated, I pulled up my town's history. I found out it was incorporated from land once owned by a millionaire named Joseph Leary, who died in 1890 while trying to haul a load of lumber to build some sort of safari park in the Midwest. The land was eventually settled in 2000 after being sold from Leary's descendants, but there was no mention of any other towns or settlements nearby.

Before I could find more answers, my phone lit up with a call from Luke. ""Feeling better, buddy?"" he asked, his voice thick with the mock concern of a disappointed parent. ""What are you talking about?"" I replied, genuinely confused.

Luke chuckled. ""You totally greened out last night. Talking about some hidden town that's like a perfectly preserved time capsule from the '80s.""

I pinched the bridge of my nose, sighing. ""Look, man, I know what I saw. If you want to see for yourself, get your ass over here and bring a McGriddle and a hash brown."" I knew that even if he didn't believe me, the chance of a place like that existing was too tempting an opportunity for him to pass up. Plus, I knew that asshole didn’t have anything better to do. Being unemployed and all.

""Okay, okay, I'm putting my clothes on,"" he said. ""Be right over.""

Once we were fed and equipped, we set off in my car toward the mystery town. Luke kept his phone out, scrolling through maps and forums. ""Dude, you're so full of shit,"" he said, laughing sarcastically. ""There's no town or anything near where you told me.""

I gripped the steering wheel tight. ""I don't care what you think. I saw it with my own eyes. I felt it. I even smelled the damn air. There is a town in the middle of the woods untouched. And you're just mad that I found a cool, untouched, abandoned town and you didn't.""

To this he scoffs and says,

“I think your pen is laced, and you were having intense hallucinations.” He switches to a mocking Cockney accent and says, “You imagined seeing these things, and now you’re dragging me along in your drug-fueled quest to find the hidden village.”

I pressed the brake suddenly, causing him to jolt forward in his seat, his seatbelt catching him and whipping his head down. His iced coffee spilled partially on his stomach and onto his pants.

“You asshole!” He shrieked, frantically wiping away the light brown droplets from his shirt and crotch, while I belly laughed in the driver seat.

After Luke finished wiping up his spilled coffee, his mood soured. The rest of the drive was quiet, save for his quiet curses and the sound of the car stereo. I kept my eyes peeled for the turn-off, and to my relief, there it was—that same unassuming lane cutting into the woods. I turned onto the road, and Luke’s head immediately snapped up from his phone. ""Hold on, man,"" he said, his voice dropping an octave. ""This road isn’t on the GPS.""

“I told you!” I exclaimed as I turned onto the unsuspecting road. “You need to learn to trust m—” He cut me off before I could gloat. “This road looks almost brand new,” he stated with a puzzled look.

He was right. The dirt road was free of any ruts or tire marks, almost perfectly clean, as if it had been leveled a few hours ago. We drove for another few minutes before the car's engine began to sputter and die. The dashboard lights flickered once and then went dark. I tried to turn the key again, but all I got was a single, helpless click.

Luke looked at me, his eyes wide. ""What the hell? It was just working.""

""I don't know,"" I said, a pit forming in my stomach. The silence that fell over us was absolute, heavier than any silence I'd ever known. ""We have to walk. It can't be far from here.”

We got out of the car and began the trek down the unnaturally clean road. The trees on either side stood tall and straight, casting long, uniform shadows that made it feel like we were in a tunnel. We spoke in hushed tones, our voices swallowed by the oppressive quiet. Suddenly, a wave of sound washed over us, so jarring it made us both jump. It was the low murmur of dozens of conversations, a symphony of voices and tones. The sound was disembodied, as if it were coming from a hidden source, but as we walked on, it grew louder and more distinct. We looked at each other, our confusion replaced by a shared sense of disbelief.

A few minutes later, the woods opened up, and there it was. The town was exactly as I had seen it, but it was bustling with people. They were walking down the sidewalks, chatting on front porches, and tending to their perfectly manicured lawns. Everything was spotless, from the paint on the houses to the clothes on their backs. The only thing missing was cars; not a single vehicle was parked on the perfectly clean streets.

Luke just stood there, speechless. The chatter was all around us now, a chorus of voices that seemed too loud for the small space. He looked at me, his face pale. ""What is this place?"" he finally whispered. I had no answer.

We both just stood there, staring at the impossible sight in front of us. Luke's disbelief had completely vanished, replaced by a pale, wide-eyed terror. The town was alive. People walked down the sidewalks with deliberate grace. Their smiles were plastered on their faces, frozen and perfect, and their eyes seemed to stare through us, not at us. The conversations were a low, rhythmic hum that reverberated throughout the otherwise silent town.

""This is not real,"" Luke whispered, his voice trembling. ""What is this place?"" Before I could answer, a pale woman approached us. She was dressed in a pristine floral dress, her hair fixed in a perfect bun on top of her head. Her smile was the widest of all, but her eyes were different. They didn't seem to ever focus on a single point, as if both were moving independently, trying their best to synchronize. ""Hello, gentlemen,"" she said, her voice a little too sweet, a little too loud. ""You boys seem lost.""

She didn't wait for us to answer. She just held out a hand, gesturing to the town square. ""We don't get many visitors here in Haven,"" she continued, her head tilted at a strange, unnatural angle. ""Please, let us show you around. Stay for a while.""

As she spoke, others began to turn and face us. The low hum of conversations died down, replaced by a dozen pairs of eyes focused on us. They had the same impossibly wide smiles and vacant stares. Luke took a shaky step back.

""I think we should go,"" he said, his voice barely a breath.

“Nonsense,” the pale lady said, her smile barely even wavering. “Don’t be shy. Haven has so much to offer. With her porcelain-colored hand, she gestured to the town ahead. “Let me show you our little slice of paradise.” Against our better judgment, or rather, against Luke's frantic protests and my own growing dread masked by a strange curiosity, we were shown through the town. The woman, who introduced herself as Margaret, led the way, her movements graceful and deliberate. The other residents of Haven fell into step around us, their smiles fixed, their eyes still unsettlingly unfocused. A small crowd forming in our midst.

Margaret pointed out the meticulously kept gardens, the perfectly painted houses, and the silent, empty streets. ""Our town is a haven, you see,"" she chirped, her voice almost melodic. ""A place where everything is always as it should be.""

We passed the general store I had explored the day before, its ""OPEN"" sign still hanging. It looked the same, perfectly frozen in time, but now there were figures moving inside, their smiles mirroring those on the street. They paused their silent restocking of shelves and hushed transactions to watch us pass. Next, we walked by the school; the red kickball in the four-square court was being tossed around by four children. The playground was full of kids, their laughter strangely muted, their movements synchronized as they swung on the swings and slid down the slide. They waved at us with identical, polite gestures. ""Our children are always well-behaved,"" Margaret said proudly. ""They understand the importance of harmony.""

The whole time, the low hum of conversation persisted, a background drone to Margaret's cheerful narration. It was the sound of many voices saying nothing of substance, a constant stream of random greetings and nonsensical rambling. Luke kept trying to pull me away, whispering frantic pleas to escape, but the silent, smiling crowd hemmed us in, their presence a gentle but inescapable barrier. ""See?"" Margaret said, stopping in the town square, where the flagpole stood motionless. ""Isn't it lovely? Doesn't it feel...peaceful?"" I had to admit, there was a strange sort of beauty to the stillness, a visual perfection that was undeniably captivating. But beneath the surface, a deep unease churned in my stomach. It was too perfect, too quiet, too...controlled.

""Where are the cars?"" Luke blurted out, his voice cracking with tension. ""Why isn't anyone driving?""

Margaret simply smiled, her unfocused eyes drifting past him. ""We have no need for such things in Haven. We have everything we need right here. Don’t we, Julian?"" she said as her eyes tried to meet mine.

The woman's smile didn't waver, but her words felt like a key turning in a lock. Luke grabbed my arm, his grip like a vise. ""Julian, we have to go. Now!”

We turned and started walking backward, our eyes locked on her. The other people in the town, who had been standing still, began to move. They weren't running or even walking fast. It was a slow, fluid advance, a coordinated drift that made the crowd feel like a single being. Their unnervingly perfect smiles were fixed on us. Their eyes, moving independently, seemed to be calculating our every move.

Margaret took another step toward us, her voice a low, soothing hum. ""There's no need to be frightened. We just want to make you feel at home."" She held her hands out, gesturing to the silent town around us. ""After all, you've been so restless, so lost. Wouldn't you like to finally find your way home?""

Her question hit me with the force of a physical blow. She wasn't talking about the detour or the drive. She was talking about my restlessness, my constant search for a place that was quiet and untouched. My sacred find. The town hadn't just appeared; it had called to me. It knew what I wanted.

""We have everything you could ever need right here,"" she said, her head tilting to the side. The people behind her, a wall of smiling faces, followed the motion in unison. All together they said, ""No more looking, no more searching. Just perfect stillness.""

I didn't wait to see more. We both bolted, not even bothering to look back. The perfectly clean streets that had seemed so beautiful just moments ago now felt like a terrifying, open plain. The silence was gone, replaced by the unified rhythm of footsteps behind us, a synchronized pounding that sounded less like a chase and more like a stampede.

Luke shrieked, a high-pitched cry of pure terror. ""They're too fast!""

I risked a glance over my shoulder and saw them. They moved with an impossible, unnatural speed, their faces still frozen in those unnerving smiles. Margaret was at the front, her arms swinging in a wide arc. They weren't running so much as they were gliding, their feet barely seeming to touch the ground. We rounded a corner, dashing past the general store I had first explored. I knew we couldn't outrun them in the open. I saw an alleyway between two houses and pulled Luke into it. We pressed ourselves against the wall, our chests heaving.

The humming sound I had heard in the movie theater was back, but now it was louder. It was a low, vibrating thrum that seemed to come from the very ground beneath our feet. The walls of the houses felt cold and strangely soft against my back.

A moment later, the people of the town swarmed past the entrance to the alley, their silent pursuit a chilling contrast to our panicked breaths. I thought we were safe, but then I looked at the end of the alley. It was blocked. A solid brick wall now stood where a small fence had been just minutes before. The air grew colder. The humming grew louder, and I could feel the vibrations in my bones. I glanced back at the street. The perfect, smiling faces were now turning toward our hiding place, their synchronized heads tilting in unison. They knew we were here. We were trapped.

The brick wall was solid, and the rhythmic, synchronized footsteps of the townspeople grew louder with every second. Luke let out a guttural sob, his shoulders shaking. ""We're trapped,"" he choked out, his eyes wide with a horrifying realization.

I looked at the walls of the alley, the brick and siding looking too perfect, too clean. The humming sound was so loud now it felt like a bass note, a vibration I could feel in my chest. The walls of the houses on either side of us seemed to bulge and shift, the shadows twisting into shapes that were not quite right. The town wasn't just a place; it was a living, thinking thing, and it was closing its fist around us.

A moment later, the first of them entered the alley. It was Margaret, her face a mask of that perfect, unsettling smile. She was followed by a dozen more. They didn't run at us. They simply walked, their heads tilted in unison, their eyes unmoored and staring past us. Luke and I braced ourselves, but their movements were unnervingly gentle. Two men took hold of Luke, their grip cold and firm, and a woman on either side of me took my arms. They held us tight, their hands as cold and clammy as a raw chicken breast. Their smiles never wavered.

""We told you not to be frightened,"" Margaret said, her voice still unnaturally sweet. ""There's no need for that here. You've come home. Now, let's get you two settled.""

We were forced out of the alley and back into the town square, the bright sunlight casting long, strange shadows. The people of Haven surrounded us, a silent, smiling crowd, and we were led toward the town hall, which now felt less like a building and more like the entrance to a cage.

We were led inside and down a long, immaculate hallway to a room that looked like a large, brightly lit common area. The air smelled of old paper and something sickly sweet. The group of people stopped, holding us in place. Margaret stepped forward, her unsettling smile a permanent fixture. The other townspeople stood in silence, their eyes fixed on us. Luke struggled against the two men holding him. ""Let go of me, you fucking freak! What is this place? You're all insane!""

The woman's smile tightened just a fraction. ""We're not insane. We're a family. Haven is a family. We're all here, together, always."" ""Who are you?"" I asked, ignoring Luke's frantic struggles. ""And what do you want?""

""I am a vessel for the town,"" she replied, her gaze seeming to drift between my eyes. ""And so are they. We all are. We were lost, just like you, but the town found us. Haven brings us all together, unites us. It needs more. More life, more peace, more stillness.""

""It's not still; it's dead!"" Luke yelled, his voice cracking. ""There are no cars, no modern anything! This place is a museum, not a town!"" The woman shook her head slowly. ""The outside world is the museum. A museum of chaos and noise. Here, we are perfect. The town makes sure of it. Haven protects us from the world, and we, in turn, become a part of it. A perfect, unified consciousness.""

I stared at her, trying to comprehend the impossible. ""What happens to people who... become a part of it?""

Her smile widened again. ""Oh, you will be so happy. The town will take your memories, your worries, and your anxieties. It will put them all to rest. You will become a part of us, and we will become a part of you. You will find that perfect stillness you’ve been looking for. Forever.""

Luke finally broke free of his captors, stumbling backward. ""No! I'm not doing this! I'm not becoming one of your dolls!"" He screamed, his eyes wide with a horrifying realization.

The woman's head tilted to the side. ""It is not your choice. Haven is hungry, and you are here now. It will take what it wants, and you will give it willingly. You will be one of us.""

As she spoke, the people behind us began to move, their bodies swaying in a low, hypnotic rhythm. The humming sound was back, louder than ever. It was coming from all of them at once, a collective vibration that echoed the woman's words and seemed to fill the room with a palpable sense of dread.

The humming was a growing pressure, a low, resonant drone that felt like a sound wave and a physical touch all at once. My mind screamed in protest, but I couldn't tear my eyes from Margaret's.

""You've been searching for it your whole life, Julian,"" she said, her voice cutting through the noise. ""The quiet. The stillness. It's the only thing you've ever really wanted.""

Her smile widened. ""Did you really think it was a detour that brought you here? An accident? Oh, my dear boy. The signs you followed... they were never real. Haven simply gave you what you were looking for. We saw your desire, your need for stillness, and we showed you the way.""

A cold, sick feeling washed over me, a greater terror than any chase. The town hadn't just appeared; it had created a path for me, a suggestion whispered into my mind until it became a reality. It had lured me here, knowing I would be the perfect specimen.

""Why me?"" I choked out a desperate plea. ""How could you have known?""

The woman's head tilted. ""The stillness you seek, the peace you crave…it's all an escape. A place to run from the noise that shaped you. A place to hide from the screams, from the slamming doors, and from the angry shouts that followed you from childhood. You spent your life hiding in closets, Julian, just to find a single moment of quiet. That's why you explore abandoned places. You weren't looking for history; you were looking for a place he could never find you.”

Luke lunged at her, screaming, ""Get away from him! You crazy bitch!"" But before he could reach her, the people around us moved as one, their arms like perfectly synchronized pistons. They grabbed Luke and dragged him away, his frantic cries swallowed by the humming. I tried to turn, to fight, but the two people holding me were unnaturally strong. They began to pull me, their cold hands unyielding as they led me deeper into the building. The walls began to pulse, and the floor felt soft beneath my feet. We were no longer on solid ground. We were descending.

The air grew heavy, thick with the scent of pine and something else, something metallic and sweet. We were in a vast, echoing space. It was not a building or a room, but a cavernous, dark chamber. I looked up and saw that the ceiling was made of the same pulsing, organic material I had glimpsed earlier, with a low, vibrating light filtering through its surface. We were in Haven's belly.

The walls around us began to throb, a deep, sickening rhythm that I could feel in my bones. A thick, viscous liquid oozed from the seams, collecting in dark pools on the wet ground below. Dark veins pulse with every move. The metallic, sweet smell intensified, and a low, resonant drone filled my head. It was the sound of the town, not a hum but a collective, biological roar.

My legs went jelly. I crumpled to the ground, and the pulsing floor seemed to reach up to catch me, its surface soft and sticky. I felt a tingling sensation spread through my skin, followed by a burning warmth that moved deep into my muscles. My body was changing. The bones in my fingers felt like they were liquefying, my muscles dissolving, and my very skin being pulled and stretched.

I watched in horrified fascination as the two people holding Luke suddenly released him. He stumbled, gasping for air, and then looked down at his own hands. The skin was rippling, bubbling, like water coming to a boil. His bones seemed to melt, his fingers shrinking and fusing together. His body began to contort, his limbs twisting into a grotesque, inhuman shape. He opened his mouth to scream, but no sound came out—only a low, vibrating hum, a sound I knew was being absorbed into the very walls around us. His eyes, wide with terror, were the last part of him to go before his form dissolved into a grotesque, fleshy puddle on the pulsing floor. The puddle was then absorbed, leaving nothing behind.

I could feel my memories being drained from me, not as a mental act, but as a physical one. I saw my father's angry face, his mouth open in a silent scream. The image wasn't fading; it was being sucked from my mind, devoured by the buzzing presence all around me. A feeling of profound calm washed over the terror, easing the pain. I was becoming nothing. My fears, my identity, my very existence. All being taken away, washed over by a quiet that was finally, completely absolute.

And I had found my perfect stillness.",1,1755749446.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1mw0way,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodTheorists/comments/1mw0way/theory_request_the_4th_flavor/,Theory Request: The 4th Flavor,"I haven't watched the channels admittedly in a while, so this coming to my brain gives me the perfect reason to come back and watch. 

If you ever watched Kids Next Door, you would know about the 4th Flavor. In the episode ""F.L.A.V.O.R."" Numbah 5 searches for the mysterious 4th Flavor of the original flavors of ice cream. Along with Vanilla, Chocolate, and Strawberry, the fourth flavor, (golden yellow in color, btw) was lost to time, locked away because the flavor was so good, the flavor ""gurus"" thought everyone would eat it all away from them. Supposedly, it was ""better than all the other"" original flavors, and thus seriously addictive. Only someone ""worthy"" could find and taste the flavor, implying it to be someone with great self control. 

Long story short, the Delightful Children From Down the Lane get involved and ""destroys"" the 4th Flavor because they put ""jimmies"" (sprinkles) on it, which is forbidden because ""a good flavor doesn't need anything added to it."" Luckily, a drip of the last of it landed on Numbah 5's hat and she finally gets to taste it. But before she says out loud what it tastes like, she gets a call from Numbah One, heads back home, and the episode ends.

Everything from Banana to Coffee has been guessed by fans. But there are some hints to narrow it down. First of all, like stated before,
 the 4th Flavor is golden yellow. 🟡 Second, it is an original/old school flavor, so closer to Rum Raisin and Black Walnut than Lavender Vanilla or Salted Caramel. Third, from the series finale, Numbah 0 stated that the closest he got to the 4th flavor's taste is blurpleberry candy. Now, I didn't see the candy episode, and blurpleberry isn't a real flavor, but since this flavor sounds like a clear mix of blueberry and purple, I'm guessing it's a blueberry-grape like taste. I don't remember the commenter's name, but they said the real version of this flavor would be sweet and sour grape. 

There's your clues! I'm excited to see what what everyone comes up with. Here's hoping this becomes an episode! 🤞🏾Thanks for reading!",1,1755749433.0,FoodTheorists,1,1.0,False
1mw0w8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mw0w8d/m23_gf22_im_confused/,M(23) GF(22) I’m confused.,"Hi, I’m really embarrassed to be here in the first place. Never thought I’d ever open up like this. I don’t have anybody else I can open up to, so I’m here asking for help/advice anonymously. My girlfriend during the beginning of the relationship had stated that she would never cheat because she had gotten cheated on her previous relationships. She came out of a pretty abusive relationship about a year ago. But besides the past, we were actually doing fine. We were hanging out almost everyday. She was making me happy every single time we were together. Idek remember the last time I had been this happy with somebody. She just picked up a full time recently. A dream job she was really hoping on getting. I was super excited for her. At the time I even tried to surprise her with sort of a dinner date and planned on giving her some things that she liked for congratulations. But she said she couldn’t go because she was actually having dinner with her mom. Which understandable. Why would I say something about that, it’s her mother. But every time I tried to see her to give her some things she had an excuse saying she was tired. Or she had other friends that she go hang out with instead. I get it she wants to hang out with family more often, and she wants to hang out with friends. But I don’t think there’s any room for me. I feel neglected. Every single time I try to make plans she is too tired and wants to plan for the next day. But when it’s her friends, she goes right away to hang out. Has she grown bored of me. Is she slowly losing feelings for me. Or am I just over exaggerating or thinking too hard about it. She’s really just that busy.

But also, to go on about why I’m here asking for advice. My girlfriend and I have been together for 2 months going on 3 months on the 6th of September. Recently about 3 weeks ago my girlfriend called me one morning stating that she would go have coffee with a guy alone for a bit. I stated that I was not okay with this at first. She said it would be nothing, and that she just wanted to catch up with an old friend and see his Tesla, because apparently she had never been on one. I stated that we would talk later. She still went to hang out with this guy. I seen that they went to get coffee and then to a parking lot at a park. I realized there that I wanted to end this relationship because I didn’t feel comfortable with this at all. So when she got back home, I picked her up and went to the nearest park to end it. She stated that nothing happened. But I still was adamant about ending this relationship. She cried and begged to not end things. I eventually gave in and just set a boundary that I wasn’t comfortable with that. She swore she would change and never put me in that situation. But coming to today. Yesterday she went out to catch up with some old high school friends. I was fine with this because it was a group of people meeting again. But then later we were talking and she stated that next Monday, she would be going to the movies with 3 people. But it is possible that the other people may not show up, so in the end it may just be my gf and some random old high school friend I’ve never heard about. 

Im really conflicted. I know what I should do. But the little bit of me wants to trust her because she has been honest with me about everything, or at least I hope. It’s not like she’s hiding these hangouts. But either way why does she need to hang out with another guy alone. It’s so weird to me and I can’t wrap my head around this. I had stated that I trust her, but I’m still conflicted. She went ahead and put me in a situation I told her not to put me in. I thought we set that boundary a while ago. But I don’t know what to do. I’m honestly afraid to be alone because I really liked the way she makes me feel when we’re together. But when we aren’t, I feel like I’m getting eaten from the inside out. I’m sorry this is long. Like I really want to trust her. But I’m just scared",1,1755749428.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1mw0vw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFLSupercoach/comments/1mw0vw8/the_trading_post_round_24_2025/,The Trading Post - Round 24 2025,"**The Trading Post with CoffeeTim - Round 24**


With heavy hearts and injury-riddled lists we move into the final week of AFL supercoach for the year. It's been quite the journey with surprising ascents and descents impacting our final rank, but as an esteemed philosopher once said, ""it's the climb.""


This week most of us will have our depth tested further with the loss of Rankine, and it goes without saying that if you have any trades at all left then now is the time to use them.


**DEFENDERS**


**Dale - 503K**, the cheapest on the list, Dale will be in the same position as the other key WBD players as they engage in a pre-finals final with FRE. He was back to his best last week and performed well against the Dockers in their last encounter, and as always he will be pivotal to their structure coming out of the back half. FRE traditionally don't play a defensive forward, so he should be a safe pick.


**Sheezel - 579K**, equalled the all-time disposal record last week against RIC, and although this weeks opponent (ADE) is decidedly more challenging, Sheezel has settled well into the CBA role with only one score sub 90 and six > 110 since the bye. As a side note, he will be one to think about starting next year given his likely cheaper price from his middling average for the year thanks to positional inconsistency in the first half of the year.


**Holmes - 581K**, was kept quiet against SYD last week but it's highly unlikely that RIC will have the personel to achieve the same. You would back him for 120+ this week.


*Speculative Defence Picks*


**Blakey - 564K**, has shown a tendency this year to decimate weaker teams who can't stop him running of the half-back line, with scores of 155/123/146/136 in the last few games against WCE cellar-dweller brethern ESS/RIC/NTH. He's my smokey for best speculative inclusion this week and could give you a leg up over a more standard inclusion with a difficult matchup like Clark/Rozee/Zorko.


**MIDFIELDERS**


**Heeney - 589K**, has been in scintilating form recently but was strangled last week by O'Connor in a dissapointing outing for SYD. With the return of Grundy this week and the lack of tagger options, Heeney should have no issues backing up his ceiling scores from his two recent games against WCE (165 and 150). At an eye watering 9.3% ownership he's the perfect option to get the leg up in head-to-head for the league grand final.


**Dawson - 613K**, also in fantastic form and against a sub-par opposition this week (NTH). The only minor risk here is that ADE rest him as a the sub out if the win is sufficently guarenteed late in the game to avoid injuring him before the finals, but given GEE could steal the minor premiership if ADE lose there is more incentive to keep him playing to lock up the win.


**Bontempelli - 698K**, in WBD's biggest game of the season, their big-game player will be leading the charge. 6 of his last 9 games have had scores above 130, with only one below 100, he's the same Bont we know and love and if for some reason you've been anti-PODding him, have a spare trade in the final round, and have the capacity to bring in a 700K player (surely there's at least one person who fits this incredibly niche set of requirements), then this is the time.


*Speculative Midfield Picks*


**Gulden - 507K**, continuing the theme of SYD superstars being recommended against WCE, Gulden looks like a great value option if you can't afford any of the 580K+ players above with his two recent performances against SYD bringing scores of 129 and 164.


**RUCKS**


**Grundy - 746K**, providing Grundy makes his anticipated successful return from concussion, and if Ladhams is dropped or named as sub, he's the clear best pick of the week. He is favoured by a clear skill and scoring difference against his direct opponent (Flynn), and has a firing midfield to feed.


**Gawn - 645K**, is the next best pick, somehow remaining in career best (or, at least, supercoach best) form and with respectable scores of 120-130 against Cameron in recent encounters.


**Xerri** has a difficult matchup against ROB, **Jackson** scored poorly last week with only 26% of the ruck contests, **Marshall** has a difficult matchup against Briggs, and **Cameron** has a difficult matchup against Gawn.


If Pittont isn't named, then **De Koning - 388K** could be a great cheap inclusion (either in the ruck or at flex). Some have been quick to forget that he averaged 119 for the first 7 games of the season as solo ruck, and he scored 146 against Goldstein when they last met in round 13. There's every chance he gets the second highest ruck score this week if he's solo in the ruck.


**FORWARDS**


**Thilthorpe - 528K**, should have little difficulty kicking a bag against NTH, who let Lynch (a lesser player in a lesser team) have 7 shots on goal last week. If you have some cash in the bank and are looking to trade out Rankine, Thilthorpe is probably the best pick this week.


*Speculative Forward Picks*

If you are looking to trade out Rankine but have no cash in the bank and need someone priced equivalently or cheaper, then two options present themselves.


**Warner - 460K**, fits the aforementioned bill of a talented player against a lesser team, but hasn't exactly set the world on fire since round 10 with an 89.5 average. If you already have Cameron or are spooked by his goalless game against SYD last week, then Warner is a reasonable selection.


**Cameron - 500K**, it's hard to see him going goalless this week against RIC, especially given that he scored 131 with 4 goals from 9 shots on them eariler this year, but it's seeming slightly more unlikely that he gets the 21 goals required to bring him to 100 by season's end.


Thank you for reading these this year, and I hope that they added some degree of value - either by way of information to aid trade planning, or an opportunity for discussion, or just as idle content that you can read when you don't have headphones to listen to the rest of the Supercoach content out there. I'm looking forward to next year's team building (and possibly the 2025 Finals supercoach that there are whispers about), and will hopefully be able to do a review or two of this season over the coming weeks.

I haven't used it yet and probably never will and here's why: I live next to an abandoned building (also near a business building). To give a layout, the abandoned building has a shaded parking lot and then curves to the side and ends with a fence. My balcony is on the side where the fence is. 

The problem is is that there is a black Suburban that parks on my side for at least 2-3 hours a day. The windows are very tinted and once, I saw a man get out and look around then get back in the car. I'm hoping  it's just an affair or something because I get so scared. My balcony is the second floor and it is right next to my desk where I work from home so I am very close to the ground. 

As I am typing right now, there are two dodge chargers parked in a line and have been there for about thirty minutes. I may be a little paranoid, but this space is perfect for crimes and drug deals. Also, it is super dark outside.

I am posting this in hopes that anyone has any advice for me or any ideas on what could be going on. I really don't want to fear my balcony or have to close my blinds all the time hoping not to get involved in something, I just want to drink coffee and read a book while enjoying the sun.

My First Client Meeting in Bahrain’s Seef District\
There’s something unforgettable about my first client meeting at the gleaming Bahrain Financial Harbour—sunlight reflecting off turquoise glass, the tranquil expanse of Bahrain Bay in the distance, and the vibrant energy of professionals moving through the Seef District’s buzzing cafes. That morning, two founders—one Saudi, one Bahraini—sat with me in a corner of a modern majlis, coffee served with cardamom and dates. Their start-up dream? E-commerce. Their main concern? Navigating Bahrain’s consumer protection requirements for their soon-to-be-launched online store.\
(If you’ve ever struggled to explain to a client—over coffee at the Diplomatic Area’s Almoayyed Tower—why listing a returns policy in Arabic and English isn’t just wise, but now required, you know how quickly regulatory details become real business pain points.)\
\
Alt text: Professional business people in a modern meeting room discussing company strategy., online sales accounted for 21% of all retail transactions in Bahrain—a 16% jump since 2022. Reuters reports projected e-commerce market value hitting $1.15 billion BHD by the end of 2025 (source).\
What’s fueling this? Not just a tech-savvy Generation Z, but the government’s fast-tracked business formation reforms, streamlined by MOICT and EDB through digital platforms like Sijilat. The recent 2025 E-Commerce Law Update (enforced April 1) introduced mandatory disclosures for online businesses, stricter privacy requirements, and new consumer redress procedures.\
\
Bahrain is now the Gulf’s most agile e-commerce jurisdiction for startups and investors.\

* Transparent, online company setup (company formation process guide)\
* Free zone incentives for digital trade (explore free zones)\
The Sijilat portal means no more queueing in government offices—if you know how to prepare documents and time your submissions.\
But, as I learned (after a frantic call from a client during Ramadan), business hours shift unexpectedly and face-to-face majlis meetings remain key for smoothing over last-minute regulatory hiccups.\
\
What Consumer Protection Measures Must an E-Commerce Business Implement?\
1. Clear Disclosure of Business Identity and Contact Details\
\
Register on Sijilat, obtain a valid Commercial Registration (CR)\
Display CR number, registered address, and all contact details prominently on your website (full CR guide)\
Disclose legal entity type: WLL, SPC, BSC(C), etc. (Read more: company structures in Bahrain)\
\
Tip: Place your CR info in your footer, invoice, and order confirmation for automatic compliance.\
\
2. Transparent Product Information\
\
List all product characteristics, prices (with VAT), country of origin\
Provide digital copies of warranty and after-sales terms\
Show full returns, refund, and cancellation policies—in both Arabic and English\
\
Insider Trick: Many new e-commerce founders forget to update policies for Ramadan or Eid sales. Keep templates ready for rapid updates during peak shopping periods.\
\
3. Secure Payment and Data Privacy Practices\
\
Use PCI DSS-compliant payment gateways\
Encrypt customer payment and personal information (SSL/TLS certificates mandatory under 2025 law)\
Explicitly state data use and retention policies\
Allow users to opt out or delete their data per Bahrain’s new PDP law (enforced 2025)\
\
When I implemented a third-party gateway integration in Bahrain Bay, strict LMRA audit protocols delayed our launch by four days—always budget extra time for payment partner approval.\
\
4. Consumer Rights, Complaints, and Refund Mechanisms\
\
Provide a visible, simple process for complaints (contact form or hotline)\
Guarantee a minimum 7-day cooling-off period for returns unless for perishable goods or custom orders (per E-Commerce Law update 2025)\
Commit to refund timelines (typically 7-14 business days)\
\
Common mistake: Not monitoring your complaints inbox—MOICT mystery shopper programs penalize slow replies!\
\
5. Product Safety and Authenticity\
\
Sell only genuine, authorized goods; counterfeit penalties increased last April\
For food, cosmetics, or health goods: register with MOH and comply with LMRA labor rules\
Display product safety certifications and batch numbers\
\
\
6. Marketing Ethics and Fair Competition\
\
Avoid misleading offers, false testimonials, and unapproved influencer endorsements\
Clearly mark paid partnerships and sponsored content, as per the 2025 EDB influencer marketing guidance\
\
\
\

Choose “E-commerce” or “Online Trading” in business activity codes\
If foreign-owned, review ownership rules and 99% foreign ownership policy\
\
Tip: Mondays before 10:00 am in Seef are the quietest for Sijilat document drop-off—less queue, more help.\
\
Step 2: Collect Required Documents\
\
Passports and CPR IDs for all founders\
Drafted Articles of Association (template available from Keylink)\
Lease agreement for business address (virtual offices at Bahrain Bay are fast to approve)\
Proof of share capital deposit (for WLL/BSC)\
\
Document hack: Print color scans—officials often prefer these over black-and-white for first submission.\
\
Step 3: Apply for Commercial Registration (CR) via Sijilat\
\
Complete online application (full process guide)\
Attach all documents digitally\
Pay CR fees (typically 200-500 BHD for e-commerce activities)\
\
Time-saving tip: Batch submit for MOICT, LMRA, and Municipality approvals in a single Sijilat session to avoid delays. I’ve seen 2-week delays for those who submit piecemeal.\
\
Step 4: Open Bank Account and Set Up Payment Gateway\
\
Prepare CR, lease, and Articles for bank compliance teams\
Partner with a PCI DSS-approved payment provider (recommended: BENEFIT, PayTabs, or Network International)\
\
Some new banks (like ila Bank in Diplomatic Area) process digital onboarding in 72 hours—but only if all CR docs are in order.\

AITA for ruining my brother and his wife's pregnancy news with the news of my recent diagnosis?


Bit of backstory, my brother and I are very close, his wife and I not so much, we've had our fair share of tension. Anyway I fell sick in the middle of may, but held off getting checked out because of covid and safety reasons. Eventually when June started I decided to go check it out, turns out it was stage 2 breast cancer.


I decided to tell my family 2 days ago since lockdown laws have been lifted, so I invited everyone over and when I told my brother and his wife he said okay that's fine because he has news to share too. So our family gathered and my brother decided to go first (he did ask me) and he announced that his wife is 4 months pregnant. Of course everyone was overjoyed.


After about an hour they asked about my news, and I knew this was probably the last time in a long while before I had everyone here in person, so I told them. And of course the initial joyous atmosphere was gone. The rest of the evening was a lot of support for me and not a lot of attention on my brother and his wife.


My brother didnt seem to mind this, as he was quite distraught with my news, but I saw his wife pretty upset and cornered off. So I decided to approach her, and I apologized for the timing of it all. She told me I could have waited a bit and skyped everyone with the news, as it's just stage 2, and let my brother and her have this moment with their family. I told her I initially called this meeting for this exact reason and she said she knows but I knew my news would damper everyone's mood.


So I told her shes being ridiculous and I wanted to tell my family in person, since they are my family after all. And she burst in tears and demanded to go home, which my brother obliged to even though he was confused. He promised he would come see me soon since he stays close by to me. Later that evening I get a message from him asking if I told his wife that she isnt part of the family and that I deliberately wanted the attention on me, because that's what shes upset about.


Also the next day my parents called me to check up on me and my mom mentioned that my brothers wife called yesterday evening really upset telling them what ""I said"" and claiming I'm jealous because shes pregnant and I'm trying to ruin her life. I told my parents what actually happened and what i really said and its caused not only tension between his wife and me, but my parents and her too, and now shes also blaming me for my parents not being her biggest fans. My brother is torn but has been trying to talk to her, which results in more tears and a strain in their marriage. All this drama is making me think that I should have just called up everyone rather, or just told my brother that his news had to wait, even though that would have been selfish of me.


I really wanted my family's support that day, but I'm starting to rethink whether it was worth all this drama and potentially causing further problems. So reddit, AITA?

**VERDICT: NOT THE ASSHOLE**

**TOP COMMENTS**

**LeftHand_of_Kindness**

>NTA - You called the meeting for your news. Also, if sharing it in person was unimportant then why couldn't your SIL share the pregnancy news over Skype? Her own reasoning should have been good enough for her. And good luck with your treatment.

**~**

**Prince-Lee**

>NTA.

>I was so ready to call you YTA from the title alone.

>But *you* arranged this meeting to break the news of something very serious, and your brother decided that it was time to break news as well.

>Could you have handled this better? Well, yes— you could have asked him privately what his news was when he said he had something to announce so that it didn’t get awkward like this— but regardless, the blame does not fall on you at all.

>But the fact is that cancer is... Like, a bit more of an important thing to announce than a pregnancy, and the SIL made a huge misstep getting jealous and saying what she did (Skype? Really?!). She’s definitely the asshole here. There are things more important than a pregnancy, especially because a pregnancy has a lot more of a time frame to announce than a disease you’re going to need to get some pretty obvious treatment for.

>Also— I wish you a good recovery.

EDIT: Wow I didnt expect this to get so so much lovely feedback, and to think I was slightly scared to post this, thank you all for the unnerving support, love and huggies. I read (and still reading) every single comment made and I really really appreciate it. I will most definitely fight through. Thank you all so much.


Just wanted to add a few points:
When brother told me he had news too he was really super excited and added it as a just by the way I'll announce mine too, he did apologize and admit afterwards if he had known what my news was he would have held off his, because right now what's important is my recovery. He also admitted he wrongfully assumed that my news would automatically be good (I'm usually always the happy chirpy one). His wife wasn't too fond of this either.


Brothers wife also had a miscarriage beginning of the year, which is why this pregnancy I suppose was extra special. I'm truly happy for them, I just wish she could understand (like one user pointed out) that this isnt a competition.


I dont know why I couldn't tell him over the phone, we are really close and I knew it would have crushed him, I couldn't steal him away at the gathering either because he was the last to arrive, and when he did he just quickly mentioned ""Hey OP mind if I go first"" and I was frozen on the spot so I said sure. Also pretty silly on my part. It's hard to explain that feeling where you absolutely frozen and theres a big lump in your throat that prevents you from speaking, but saying the news in the first place was really difficult to begin with.


Edit edit: Just another point to clarify, I'm not a saint, but my brother does mean a heck of a lot to me. It's exactly why his wife and I cleared the air between us before, because I wouldn't deliberately make his life hell by pissing her off. Hence why when I saw she was upset I approached her. And when she told me I could have skyped i responded with I wanted to tell them in person since they my family and they would probably want to be there with me when I broke the news, I never once implied she wasn't a part of it. My brother and parents know this.


[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hm7myb/update_aita_for_ruining_my_brother_and_his_wifes/)  **July 6, 2020 (1 month later)**


Sorry this is so late, a lot has been happening the past month since the news came out, and since I've received a tremendous amount of love from reddit I thought it would be only fair to let you all know what happened.


First and foremost, I've started treatment, also one of the reasons I couldnt update sooner. Thank you all for your well wishes, I plan on bouncing back as soon as I can.


Anyway, I could see that my brother was under a lot of stress, and I finally sat him down to talk about it properly, he showed me a bunch of texts that his wife sent him telling him he is a shitty father for choosing me over his family, she said I was seeking attention and nobody cares about her. And one thing that really got to me was that she told him to choose once and for all, and if he picks me he loses her and his child and if he picks her she doesnt want me in their lives at all. I felt terrible, not only for him, but knowing that I could have prevented all this.


I took the time to apologize for putting him in this position, and if I had just pulled him aside soon enough and given him a heads up, he would have truly understood. Brother tells me I shouldnt apologize, because he should have been more considerate, he also mentioned that his wife would have probably still gotten mad at him whether they did or didnt give the news on that day.



So I decided I should invite her over for coffee, to sort out everything. I spoke to her alone, I asked her about everything, she was very cold and didnt really answer, so I started talking first by apologizing if I made her feel excluded from the family or that her pregnancy was of any less importance. I explained that I should have given them a heads up so we could have avoided what had happened all together and that was my fault, and that I was very sorry but I also mentioned that the way she reacted and went to the extent of lying wasnt okay.



She then started crying and vented out about how angry shes been, and that my brother always put me first and recently they've been going through a rough patch and when he ""sided"" with me it made her even more upset and feel even more lonely. She admitted she lied to my parents and my brother, saying that she was hoping they would show her more sympathy and when they were cold to her she got even more upset.


After hours of talking she apologized for how she acted and has been acting. And she would like if we moved on from this. My brother came later and they both went home, he texted me saying they both spoke for hours and agreed to couples therapy. My parents are currently living with me and helping me out tremendously, but they not quite happy with my sister in law yet, although they promise to try to work things out, things finally seemed to calm down, and let's hope it stays that way.


None of this would have been possible without the feedback you all gave me, and I'm indebted to that, so thank you!


(ETA: All of you are so kind, honestly, but I wanted to clarify that I'm no saint nor am I selfless, i know what happened wasnt entirely on me, however, in order to focus solely on my recovery I cant be stressed out about this whole situation and have all this tension around, seeing my brother being put in that position and my SIL, as hurtful as she was, being upset and holding hatred can affect herself and the baby, I did what I could to fix things so that everyone can focus on being healthy and being positive without holding any grudges, I know I sure will. I know my SIL, she can be very stubborn and unreasonable, and if I left things in her hands I'm 99% sure it would have resulted in much much worse circumstances than me putting the first hand forward, at least now I can focus on my recovery without any distress or toxicity. I'm human, I felt angry, I felt upset, yeah I wanted to give her a piece of my mind. But in doing so isnt helping myself, her, my brother, or my family, only damaging things further. This realization is what prompted me to let it all go and focus on positivity and my mental and physical health.)


Last edit: 


I spent all day on reddit reading EVERY little or big comment made, and honestly I didnt know you could feel so much support from people you never met. You are all the amazing humans. Thank you all for the upvotes, comments and awards, and I'll still read every single comment, but this will be my final edit. And for the people who asked, I'm 24 :)

I wear mostly leggings, sweatpants, hoodies and loose tshirts. I work out about 5x a week and work from home, so most of my clothes are very casual or gym attire. Usually I wear running shoes or ugg slippers. I typically wear minimal makeup or just tinted sunscreen.

One of my friends loves to wear expensive brand name clothes, always has hair and nails done, eyelash extensions and gets dolled up everytime she leaves the house. I appreciate her always looking “ put together”, but I personally prefer comfort. Whenever I meet up with this friend, she makes passive aggressive comments about my hair, clothes or shoes. One time we planned to go for a walk at the park, and  she said my shoes were embarassing and pressured me to borrow her expensive designer shoes. Tomorrow, we have casual plans to go the nearby mall and run a few errands like walking my dog, and she texted me in advance asking me to dress nicer and not wear my gym sneakers because we will be passing upscale stores.

Obviously, if I am going to an event or restaurant I will dress up, but if I am walking my dog or grabbing coffee with a friend, or just going to the mall I don’t care to look “ presentable”. I personally don’t care if a stranger thinks I look too casual or judges me for what I wear, I have no issue wearing PJs in public. But, my friend constantly making small comments and putting so much emphasis on appearance is starting to irritate me.

Three, then two, then three again. It is almost like Morse code. Wonder if anyone else notices it. Life here is monotonous and soul-sucking, yet I still return.

It's been like this ever since, so much so that I've despised myself as to why I am here. At least the routine helps. Keeps me grounded, or else I won't know what to do with myself.

At times, I thought about quitting, but recently, I was given no choice due to problems appearing out of nowhere. 

Problems that spiraled out of my control.

I have seemingly involved myself in a mess involving my wife, Sarah, and her lover, Thomas…

Even now, I sometimes catch whispers, even at work. I used to be bitter at those comments but let them be over time. Though I keep little notes every now and then.

Now, I'm just going with the flow, continuing to work. The money helps maintain some semblance of normalcy or at least as normal as things can get.

I have bills to pay and an adopted pet to feed. Funny how this has become my life now. I never saw myself as a pet owner, never even wanted one. But somehow, it all worked out.

The clock ticks down to its final moments, and my work for the day is done; it's time to head home.

I checked my watch - 5:30 PM, right on time. Exiting the old office building, I walked down the cracked sidewalks of the main road. 

Cars passed by, noisy as ever. A few minutes later, I reached the street, entering a small community neighborhood, a brief escape from the city's noise. My house is just a tiny distance down.

As the noise faded, I breathed a sigh of relief, my mind wandering as usual. Lately, my life has revolved around just two things: work and Tom. I named him after my favorite cartoon as a kid. 

He's been on my mind more than usual. My notepad fills with notes during meetings - feeding schedules, exercise routines, and strategies to make his transition easier.

This reminds me that Tom gets anxious if dinner's late, and I hate seeing him distressed. The sounds he made when that happened startled me the first time. He used to be a bit loud, but with a few quick adjustments here and there, he's much calmer now, better than ever. 

These days, I can't help but wonder what my life would be like without Tom. Probably far away from all this. But now, I have someone to care for, which changes everything.

I pause, taking in the familiar scene as more residential buildings become visible. The walk is short but revealing. Neighbors wave from their afternoon routines, their smiles never quite reaching their eyes.

Mrs. Johnson's wave seems shakier these days. Mr. Peterson barely looks my way anymore. They must know something's changed, but they don't understand. They can't.

Passing by, a flash of familiar features caught my eye - A face smiling from a poster. Fresh ink and all. A bitter sound came out of me, a slight chuckle.

Someone's been busy putting up new ones. Probably Thomas's wife. I don't know why she desperately looks for the man who left her. That smile in the photo - the same one Thomas wore that day. Even now, even after everything.

I suppress a smile, crumpling the paper and throwing it to the side before continuing. I vividly remember the day I found Sarah and Thomas together.

The sounds they made were... less than human. Fitting, really, considering how things turned out.

Neighbors watched as I did that, but none told me off. Rumors of what happened probably fueled their reactions. In a small community like this, information tends to spread faster.

They sometimes look at me with pity as I walk by, but the disappointment in their eyes says everything about my choices.

Upon arriving, the key turns in the lock, and I hear the familiar shuffle inside, then silence. 'I'm home,' I call out softly. As usual, there's no response. I've grown used to that. 

My footsteps echo against the bare walls as I step inside. In the corner sits one of Tom's makeshift sleeping areas, spaces I modified for his… unique circumstances.

He's still adjusting, I tell myself.

He was a gift from Bob, barely a week after all the drama. A good companion, he says.

At first, I resisted, but he was persistent. He said I deserved it after everything I'd been through, his words carrying a hint of expectation, almost as if I should feel grateful. It took time to accept what he was saying, but something shifted inside me when I looked into its eyes. Eventually, I brought him home.

""Hey, bud,"" I whisper, gently patting his head. He trembles slightly, his wide eyes reflecting what some might mistake for fear.

Bob assured me it was normal, that it would pass with time. Tom was a rescue, after all, and this was just part of the rehabilitation process.

It was my first time owning a pet, and the whole thing felt strange. But I know, with time, I can learn to be a better owner for him too.

Besides, Bob gave me some kind of guidebook for this. Though most information written is useless at this stage.

Bob was strange. He collected people's stories like others collected stamps, with an enthusiasm that bordered on obsession. We met not long after Sarah left, though the circumstances were anything but ordinary.

The first contact came through Sarah's phone. A text, then a call. He claimed he'd bought it from her, said she sold it as partial payment for his ""services."" The way he lingered on that last word made my skin crawl. Then he dropped the real bombshell: Sarah owed him, and since my number was the only one still saved on her phone, he figured I might cover the rest.

Her debts. Her lies. My responsibility. I felt sick.

At first, he was aggressive, his tone sharp and demanding. But something shifted when I didn't respond. His voice softened, almost... patient. ""Look,"" he said, ""I'm not here to cause trouble. I just want what's owed."" Against my better judgment, or maybe because I had nothing left to lose, I agreed to meet him.

We met in a small café downtown, the kind of place where no one asks questions. I sat with cash in my pocket and a coffee that had long since gone cold. When he arrived, I was struck by how unremarkable he looked. He wasn't what I'd imagined. No sinister aura, no flashy bravado. Just a man with a forgettable face, and eyes that felt too sharp, too knowing.

""Well, I'll be damned,"" he said, smiling like an old friend. ""You actually showed up.""

I shouldn't have stayed, but I did. We talked or rather, he spoke, and I listened. Hours seemed to pass, the cash in my pocket forgotten. Bob had this way of pulling information from me without realizing it. Every detail I shared seemed to excite him, his gaze growing brighter, more intense. It wasn't until he leaned forward, his voice low and conspiratorial, that I felt the full weight of his presence.

""You know,"" he said, almost casually, ""I could help you get back at her.""

I laughed, sharp, bitter, hollow. ""And why would you want to help me?""

His grin widened, but there was no warmth in it. ""Let's just say I have a vested interest in people like Sarah getting what they deserve. You, though... you're interesting. I'd hate to see you waste an opportunity.""

I wanted to leave. My gut told me to walk away and never look back. But I stayed. Maybe it was his words or how his gaze seemed to hold me in place. Or perhaps I just didn't care anymore.

That first meeting set the tone for what came next. He reached out again, and I answered. I can't explain why. Curiosity? Desperation? Whatever it was, I got drawn deeper into his orbit. He always had a way of making it seem like I was the one seeking him out.

Over time, he pried more out of me, my anger, regrets, and connection to Sarah. Each piece of information seemed to light a spark in him like he was piecing together some grand puzzle. I should have been alarmed by how much he seemed to enjoy it, but I was too numb to care.

""You're wasted on her, you know,"" he told me once. ""All that anger, all that hurt, just sitting there, eating you alive. What if you could do something about it?""

I never answered him, not directly. But I kept showing up. I don't know what I was hoping for, closure, maybe, or just someone to tell me what to do. Bob never gave me answers, though. He gave me tools. Options.

And then, one day, he was gone.

The last message I got from him was cryptic, just like everything else about him. ""Laying low for a while. Take care of yourself, and Tom.""

Looking back, I'm unsure what scares me more: how much of myself I gave away to Bob or how much of him still lingers in me.

The clock ticking breaks me from my musing, and my evening unfolds like a well-rehearsed play. Shoes by the door. Briefcase on the counter. Dinner preparations begin at 6:15. As the food cooks, I guide Tom to his spot in the living room.

""Hungry?"" I ask, not expecting an answer. He twitches slightly and scurries around. Seeing him okay, I finally decided to go to the kitchen.

I prepare two bowls with practiced precision. Mine is a microwaved lasagna, while Tom's is a carefully measured mixture of food and some medicine I searched online based on the guidebook. It was working, so I continued to feed it to him.

A scratching sound comes from the corner. ""Patience,"" I whisper. ""It's almost done. Just relax, bud"". I said just as the scratching stopped.

Dinner is ready, and I move to the living room. I turn on the TV. The news drones about missing cases. The numbers keep rising in our town three this month alone. I changed the channel, it was too depressing.

Tom gets agitated when they show photographs. I feed him carefully, watching with quiet satisfaction as he accepts each spoonful.

Night falls, bringing a different silence to the house, and I stare at the ceiling. Not like before. My mind keeps memories that refuse to fade. Perhaps I missed her more than I thought, but her betrayal left me hollow.

It's just Tom and me now. Tucked in the sleeping area I made for him, he whimpers softly as I head to bed, his eyes following my every move.

""Good night, Tom,"" I whisper as I drift off, feeling his gaze from the darkness. Sometimes, I hear him trying to speak, but that's impossible. Pets don't talk. At least, mine doesn't anymore.

As I felt myself slipping off, I knew I was in for another rough night.

I woke violently, jerked from another nightmare. A sigh escapes my lips as consciousness creeps back, leaving me groggy and disoriented. It's been like this since last month, the nightmares, the cold sweats. Then I feel my heart grow heavier, I don't know why, but it gets like this.

Sarah used to say I talked in my sleep. Now Tom listens instead, his eyes darting to mine the moment I wake. Sometimes, I think I see Sarah's face in those reflections.

The day everything changed is burned into my mind with perfect clarity. The wooden floors in our home still creak in that particular way, the third board from the kitchen entrance.

Sarah always avoided it when slipping out for her ""afternoon walks."" Something bitter and dark coiled in my stomach as I counted those walks. Twice a week became three times, then four.

Thomas from next door would wave to me every morning. ""Beautiful day, isn't it?"" he'd say, standing by his mailbox in that expensive running gear he'd started wearing. He was on Such a health kick, Sarah had mentioned it over dinner once, twice, and many more times. ""The neighbors say he's really transformed himself,"" she'd say, not meeting my eyes. I wonder if she noticed that she was repeating herself more and more, day by day.

Then came the excuses. Even when I saw them together, they were getting too confident. Several times, I threw hints at Thomas' wife; she knew but denied it harder than I did.

I found the truth in pieces, each discovery like a knife twisting deeper. I had a phone here. A misplaced note there. Text messages that painted pictures I couldn't unsee.

Fifteen years of marriage reduced to evidence of betrayal, cataloged in my mind like specimen slides under a microscope. Each revelation changed something in me and broke down another barrier between what I was and what I could become.

The funny thing about betrayal is that it awakens parts of you that you never knew existed. Some people just take their losses and move on, but others... Others find ways to make things right. I think I just needed the right person to push me.

However, by the end, it led me to Tom. At least I got something out of it.

Dragging myself from bed with a renewed sense of purpose. My morning routine unfolds with practiced precision. Fix the bed, check the blackout curtains, and collect my pet from his sleeping area.

Tom's quite heavy now, healthier than before. ""Almost there,"" I whisper, my voice catching as we pass Sarah's photo in the hallway. That helpless smile she wore still mocks me, but I shake it off and continue to the living room.

I placed him in his spot in the living room and prepared breakfast for the two of us; the usual…

The doorbell's sharp ring fractures the silence. Must be the neighbors again.

Tom grows restless at the sound, he always does when we have visitors. ""Now, let's go to your special place again, okay, bud.""

The storage space on the stairs has become Tom's sanctuary in cases like this. ""Just for a little while,"" I whisper soothingly, stroking his still-injured flesh. ""We don't want to make our guests uncomfortable, do we?"".

A whimper answers me, so quiet now, barely audible. Such improvement from those early days of screeching. Back when Tom still thought Sarah would save him.

 The stitches are healing nicely. Can't risk making visitors uncomfortable with his... condition. 

I straighten my tie and check my reflection. The smile in the mirror looks almost natural now, though something wild dances behind my eyes. Practice makes perfect, after all.

Sarah never appreciated my dedication to self-improvement. Neither did Thomas, in the end. But Tom... Tom understands. He has no choice but to understand.

Another performance, I say.

But before I can reach for the handle, the silence shatters as the door explodes inward, cold metal snapping around my wrists before I can even react, as I was slammed into the floor.

Several moments later, police are flocking into my house. Well… the fun's over. It was my mistake thinking I could go on like this for much longer. But there are more pets to discover, especially where I think I'm going.     

The click of the handcuffs feels like the final period at the end of one story, and the beginning of another. In the background, I can hear Tom whimpering from his room. Poor boy. He never did learn to stay quiet when it mattered most.

Bob warned me this might happen when I accepted his deal. 'Some people just won't understand my work,' he'd said. And that's fine. It's too bad, though, Tom should've had a friend. But there was a hiccup with that one. Things happen.' Bob's catchphrase, as always, echoes in my mind.

Bob said he found her along with Tom but got careless and freed her to that extent. 

Bob had pictures, and when I saw their faces staring back at me, I guess that's when I lost whatever humanity I had left.

Seeing them stripped bare like that reminded me too much of the day I found them together. The memory clouded my thoughts more than I ever expected. Maybe that’s when I stopped thinking altogether.

It makes me happy, though, that even in the short time we spent together, I had you, Tom. I will miss you, and I hope one day you’ll come back to me, where you belong.

For now, I’m just biding my time. I know I won’t be let out indefinitely, but whispers of Bob’s name keep reaching my ears, even here. Strange, isn’t it? He’s still out there. His name moves through the mouths of other inmates like smoke, wisps of his influence everywhere.

I can hear Detective Cortez pacing outside the interrogation room. He’s never been good at hiding his footsteps. If he’s listening, maybe he’s wondering why I’m so calm.

Bob’s words echo in my head, as clear as the day he said them: *“Some people just can’t understand our work, Donovan.”* I’m starting to see his point now. There’s a special clarity that comes with the right amount of chaos.

And Tom… poor, sweet Tom. One of the guards let it slip that he’s in a hospital bed, wrapped in bandages. They say he’ll need constant care for the rest of his life. But I know better. He needs *me.* He always has. You’re still my beautiful creation, even in all your brokenness.

But It's mine and something I cling to these days as proof that I remain unchanged... human. Everyone around me seems different now, despite their constant insistence that it's all in my head. Something changed one day, and somehow didn't. You might think I'm going crazy from the pills I was taking, yet I stopped those a while ago. They didn't help my problem—they only made it worse.

It started with two things I couldn't ignore. My neighbor Tom would water his lawn at exactly 7:43 every morning, his movements following the same arc, down to the precise bend of his wrist. I timed it for a week straight—not a second's difference. The barista at my local coffee shop, Sarah, began drawing identical patterns in every latte—perfect spirals that never varied, each loop precisely matching the one from the day before. I even took photos to compare them. These were little things, easy to dismiss... until they weren't.

Watching my neighbors and coworkers became like observing people rehearsing how to be themselves. Their gestures and speech carry a touch too much deliberation, like actors perfecting roles they don't quite understand. The wrongness of it makes my skin crawl, but who can I tell when everyone around me has become a perfect replica of themselves?

Then came the dreams—no, nightmares. Even that word fails to capture their weight. They began last month, and now, whenever I close my eyes for more than a minute, my body betrays me. It's as if someone flips a switch, and I'm out. Even when I fight to stay awake, my consciousness slips away the moment my eyelids drop. I jerk awake, drenched in sweat, the sheets twisted around me like restraints.

Tonight was no different. I forced myself to stay awake, but it didn't matter. When I opened my eyes, I found myself back on that train, the 8:43 to downtown. The familiar unease crept in as I looked around at my fellow passengers—some reading news, others absorbed in their phones, a few waiting listlessly for their stops.

Until it started.

A sound erupted—a scream, visceral and raw, echoing through the train's walls. It was agonizing and distorted, like nails scraping across a blackboard but emanating from human mouths. The passengers collapsed in unison, their screams matching the first. Bodies jerked and slumped, limbs moving like tangled puppets on invisible strings. The lights flickered and died. In the darkness, I could hear them: wet sliding noises and stiff, unnatural creaks that shouldn't come from human joints. The sounds were rhythmic, precise... like an assembly line at work.

When the lights returned, they were back in their seats, perfectly still. Their heads snapped upright with a sound like splintering wood, eyes facing forward... until they turned.

Their eyes. God, their eyes.

Each iris held a tinge of gold and red, like a solar eclipse painted on flesh. They didn't blink. They didn't move. Their heads remained perfectly still as their eyes tracked me. A woman three seats ahead had her arm bent backward at an impossible angle. It hung there until it snapped into place with a stiff, awful crack.

I woke up gasping, but the horror clung to me. Their eyes followed me into the waking world. I began seeing flashes of them—golden-red rings—in reflections, in mirrors, windows, even in the blank screen of my phone. Always watching, always present, just for a moment before vanishing.

I went to Dr. Lyra because I had nowhere else to turn. Simple tasks had become mountains. I couldn't function. She diagnosed it as stress and prescribed pills that made the world blur around the edges. The first dose hit me like a wave of static—not just in my vision, but deep in my skull. Colors bled together, sounds became muffled, and my thoughts felt like they were being pressed through cotton. Reality itself seemed smudged, painted over with something more... perfect.

When I stopped taking them, I thought it was over. But the world sharpened—too much. Colors became richer, sounds crisper—everything carried a weight that felt unnatural. My teeth buzzed with every sound, and my skin prickled as if electricity was running just beneath it. Beneath it all, I started hearing things: soft stiff creaks when people moved, the faint click-click of pupils adjusting to light.

During my last appointment, Dr. Lyra's face lingered too long in a smile, as though she'd forgotten to stop.

""How are the pills working, Harvey?"" she asked, her tone breezy but flat. Her voice echoed strangely in the room, hollow like a metal chamber.

When I told her I wasn't taking them anymore, her expression froze. Everything stopped—not just her face, but the room itself. For a fraction of a second, I swear I saw her flicker, like a TV losing signal. Then she resumed, too quickly. Her voice piled on top of itself as her smile stretched wider than humanly possible.

""That's... great news. Wonderful progress. But I think you should keep taking them—just a little longer. For safety.""

Her hands trembled as she shoved another bottle into my hands, and I saw something... moving beneath her skin, as if her veins were alive and rearranging themselves.

I should have listened, but I didn't.

That's when I started noticing changes everywhere. The old corner store, once grimy and cluttered, gleamed with impossible cleanliness. The cashier, Mrs. Chen—always so grumpy and loud—stood behind the counter wearing an empty smile. Her head tilted exactly fifteen degrees as she rang up my items.

Then I saw the cat.

It sat by the road, perfectly still. Too still. It was Mr. Peterson's old tomcat - I recognized the notched ear and gray patches from all the times I'd seen him prowling the neighborhood. But something was wrong. His usually matted fur, earned from years of street fights and adventures, was impossibly pristine. The scars and patches that had given his face character were gone, smoothed away like they'd never existed. When I approached, reaching out despite my instincts, his fur felt... wrong. Too perfect. Even the roughness from that time he'd gotten into a fight with a raccoon had vanished, replaced by fur so uniform it might have been manufactured.

His head turned in sharp, stiff increments, click-click-click. And his eyes... those golden-red rings. Like camera shutters adjusting their focus. They were still his eyes, the same green I'd known for years, but now they held something else, something that had erased every mark of the scrappy alley cat he'd once been. My breath caught, and the cat bolted, its movements precise and segmented, like each muscle had been calibrated to perfection.

I ran home and haven't left since. From my window, I watch, and I see it all. My neighbors' movements are too synchronized, their routines perfect. Mrs. Peterson waters her flowers at exactly 9:17 AM. Children play jump rope in flawless rhythm. Even their laughter stops and starts at precise intervals, as if on cue.

Whatever is happening, I need to figure it out before it gets to me. Am I going crazy? Am I being paranoid? The logical part of my brain screams that none of this is possible, but I've seen too much to trust logic anymore.

A knock at my door broke through my thoughts. Three precise taps, evenly spaced. Peering carefully from the corner of my window, relief washed over me as I recognized the visitors. My parents stood on the porch, wearing worried expressions that didn't quite reach their eyes. Of course—I hadn't been making my usual calls. I let them in, and they slipped into their roles: mother nagging about my self-care, father heading to the kitchen with bags they'd brought.

My mom switched to that gentle voice she'd always used when I was upset. Maybe this was what I needed after my self-imposed isolation. Maybe it was all just in my head. After all, I couldn't be wrong about my own parents. I felt warmth emanating from her as she held my hands, though something about her touch felt... odd. Her skin was too smooth, like warm plastic, but I dismissed it as she may have been too worried about me.

My dad was laughing in the kitchen, joking about what I'd been doing all this time. I finally felt relaxed, experiencing peace I hadn't known in weeks. Mom let me doze in her lap, just like when I was small. Her hand stroked my hair in perfect, metronomic motions, just like when I was a kid.

Then dad came in and saw me half-asleep. He went to the cabinet and retrieved something. Through my drowsy haze, I saw mom's smile shift, becoming more like Dr. Lyra's, more like Mrs. Chen's, more like the cat's mechanical grin before it ran off. She held my head still as dad pressed that familiar pill to my lips.

With my last bit of strength, I grabbed my mother's arm - a desperate act of defiance. That's when I felt it. The scar on her palm, the one she got years ago catching a falling knife meant for me, was gone. The rough, jagged line I'd traced a thousand times as a child had vanished, replaced by impossibly smooth skin. It was still her hand, still had every line and freckle I remembered, but it was like someone had erased the imperfections, smoothed away the history written in her flesh.

""Just take your medicine, dear,"" she whispered, her voice harmonizing with mechanical undertones. ""Everything will be clearer once you stop fighting it.""

As darkness began to take hold, I heard snippets of their conversation, but the voices... no... it couldn't be.

""Why are we still keeping this one?"" My mother's voice had lost all warmth, becoming clinical and detached, layered with whirring sounds.

""Mhmm, an experiment more or less,"" my father's voice replied, but the familiar deep tone held none of its usual affection. ""The longest-lasting subject yet. Fascinating how he senses something's wrong but can't quite grasp what.""

Before my vision finally dimmed, I saw her face above me, frozen in that too-wide smile. Her eyes rotated—those golden-red rings locking onto me.

I try to fight the darkness, but I know it's too late. It always was.

1mw0erp,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mw0erp/haven/,Haven,"I like to explore places I'm not supposed to. Abandoned malls, schools condemned because of asbestos poisonings, and once the Saint Louis Zoo at night while on a trip with an explorer buddy (not much to see really, and the security there is really good at their job). The reason I do it is to capture the perfect stillness. It's the beauty found in an abandoned food court, a space that was once a noisy tide of people clamoring for pretzels and smoothies. Now, it’s a still, hollow mausoleum of dust, and the only food being eaten is a roach that a rat happened to snag in the corner near the remnants of a Taco Bell. The silence here isn't just an absence of sound. It's a heavy, breathing presence, a memory so profound it has become a living thing, a testament to the life that once filled this hollow space. The zoo happened because I just really wanted a picture of a tiger at night. Looking back, I'm not sure how I would have done that at night without a flash. 

There's a fair amount of risk when exploring these abandoned locations. I'm always on the lookout for security guards and homeless crackheads. The building itself could be about to crumble with age, making it sketchy to walk the different levels. But every explorer hopes for one thing: to be the first to uncover a forgotten place. It's like finding a secret. The air is…different. When you step inside, you're not just crossing a threshold; you're entering into a perfect, still moment. It's a strange kind of ownership. This space, once vibrant with the lives of hundreds of people, now belongs only to you. For a moment, you are the sole witness to its elegant decay. You see the light filter through a broken window onto an old chair, and you can almost hear the conversation that was had there years ago. Every dusty object tells a story of a life that went on without you, a history that you are the first to finally see. There's a melancholic beauty in it—a feeling of both discovery and profound loss. You're an archaeologist of the recent past, and this is your quiet, sacred find. Some things should never be found.

It was a typical Wednesday afternoon. My shift at the local grocery store started at 6 a.m. and ended at 3 p.m. I left through the automatic doors, passing the same large lettering above the exit that read, “And as Always, Thank You for Shopping with Us! Bye!” It was a phrase I’d seen for three years straight. The “JULIAN” on my nametag almost entirely worn off, leaving me with most of an L and the rest the best my handwriting and permanent marker can produce. Hall and Oates’ “Maneater” was playing when I came to a detour sign on my street. Frustrated, I then remembered the signs I’d seen earlier this week saying construction was starting today. I also remembered telling myself to take the back way home and not to forget. “I should probably lay off the pen for a while,” I mumbled to myself.

I followed the detour for an obnoxious amount of time, profaning with every new orange sign I saw. I did see a mint, cherry-red '67 Camaro sitting in someone's driveway, so hey, upside. Eventually, though, a new problem emerged. Driving through some residential development, I came to a T-junction with no detour sign. I eased my car forward, squinting to see if the next sign was hiding around a corner. I scanned both sides of the road and, to my dismay, saw nothing. I gambled on a left turn—I’m a lefty after all—and kept my eyes peeled for that orange rectangle I’d been cursing earlier. After what felt like an eternity of signless turns, I did a U-turn, went back the way I came, and continued forward in search of the elusive sign.

The detour signs had become a cruel joke. After turning back, I drove for another ten minutes, my frustration mounting with every empty intersection. Just as I was about to give up and check my phone for a signal, I rounded a gentle curve and saw a turn I hadn't noticed before. It wasn't marked and didn't have a name or a sign, just a quiet, unassuming lane that cut through a thick line of trees. I took the turn, more out of desperation than curiosity.
The road was old and paved but covered in a fine layer of dust, as if it hadn't been driven on in years. The trees on either side stood so close together their branches formed a canopy, giving the whole place a hushed, twilight feel. After a couple of minutes, the woods opened up, and I saw it.

There was a town.

It wasn't a sprawling place, just a few dozen houses, a general store, and what looked like a small town hall. They weren't overgrown with weeds or covered in graffiti. They were perfectly preserved. The paint on the houses looked fresh, the lawns were trimmed, and a lone flagpole stood at the center of the town square, its rope hanging perfectly still. There wasn't a single car on the street or a person in sight. It was like I had driven off the map and into a photograph. The frustration of getting lost vanished, replaced by an intoxicating sense of discovery. I found it. The perfect stillness I’d always looked for. I had found my sacred, untouched place.

I cut the engine and sat in my car, staring at the perfect stillness. It was so quiet I could hear the ringing in my own ears. I finally got out, my boots crunching on the dusty asphalt. The sound felt sacrilegious, a betrayal of the silence. I took a deep breath, expecting the stale air of a forgotten place, but it was fresh and clean, carrying only the scent of pine.
I walked down the main street, passing houses with curtains perfectly drawn and porches with rocking chairs sitting as if they were just waiting for a visitor. I took my phone out to take a picture, noting that I had no connection whatsoever. I headed for the general store, its red and white paint looking as if it had been applied yesterday. The sign on the door read “OPEN.” I pulled on the door handle, and to my surprise, it gave way easily, the lock already broken. 

The air inside was cool and still. Cans of soup, bags of chips, and cartons of milk sat on the shelves, their labels crisp and bright, but a thick layer of dust covered everything. There was no visible decay, not a single rodent or insect in sight. The space was a perfect replica of a store, just frozen in time. I walked down an aisle, brushing my hand along a shelf, sending dust particles dancing in a beam of light from the broken window. At the counter, a glass jar was filled with what looked like pickled eggs, their cloudy liquid now settled into a murky brine.

I walked behind the counter and found a calendar hanging on the wall. It was dated January 1985. The pages were a little yellowed but otherwise perfect. Oddly, the last page torn off was for December 1984. Yes, before you ask, I did check the till; all that was there was a couple oxidized pennies and a few rotted-through rubber bands.

After the general store, I wandered deeper into the town, my sense of wonder only growing. The streets were perfectly clean, a testament to a forgotten time when someone must have cared a lot about this place.

I walked a block further and found the town's school, a small brick building with a playground out front. A red kickball sat in the middle of a perfectly preserved four-square court, as if it had been abandoned mid-game. I pushed open the unlocked door. Inside, the air was heavy with the smell of old paper and wood. In one classroom, I found a chalkboard with a single, perfectly written phrase in chalk: ""Final Exam."" The desks were all in neat rows, and on one of them was a half-finished essay about the state of the union, dated 1984.

The coolest find, though, was the movie theater. The marquee above the door was blank, but the posters in the display cases were vivid and bright, advertising movies from the 80s that I knew by heart. The box office window was open, and I stepped through into the lobby. A popcorn machine sat silent behind the counter, a single, unpopped kernel resting on the dusty surface.

I walked into the main auditorium, my footsteps echoing in the dark. The seats were worn but unbroken. I made my way to the front and looked up at the screen. That's when I felt it. A sudden, deep chill ran through me, as if a window had just opened in the dead of winter. But there were no open windows. I also heard a faint, low-pitched hum so faint I thought it was just the ringing in my ears. I dismissed it as a power line or something outside, but the feeling lingered, a subtle prickle on the back of my neck. I quickly took a picture of the dusty theater before heading out into the afternoon light.

I drove out of the town the same way I came in. My phone pinged with multiple notifications as it connected back to life. I checked the time, and it was now 9pm. But that can’t be possible. I only drove for an hour, and I was in town for two hours max. So the latest it should be is around 6pm. I chalked it up to time moving fast while having fun and carried on home. That wasn't it, though. I saw the same Camaro from earlier, but the detour signs were all gone. Even the signs near my work that led me to the town were gone too. As if they were never there in the first place.

I got home, and the first thing I did was call my best friend and fellow urban explorer, Luke. ""Dude, you're not going to believe what just happened to me,"" I said, my voice shaking with a mix of excitement and disbelief. ""It's an entire town, completely preserved. Like, a perfect time capsule from the '80s. No one's been there, no graffiti, nothing. You would have loved it.""

Luke listened quietly, then asked, ""What are you talking about? Where is it? A place like that would be all over the urbex forums.""

I explained how I found it. The strange detour signs that vanished, the road that appeared out of nowhere. Luke was silent for a moment before saying, ""Wait, what detour are you talking about? I didn’t see any construction when I passed by your house today.""

I told him I'd show him the pictures I took. I pulled up my phone's camera roll and scrolled through the photos, but nothing was there. The photos of the town, the school, and the movie theater were all gone. Being replaced by blurry, corrupted files. I kept scrolling, more and more frantic, but they were all just static.
""Dude, are you alright?"" Luke's voice was filled with concern. 
""You sound really out of it. Maybe you had a few too many pen rips.”
I told him I was fine and hung up. I sat there in silence, staring at my blank screen.

I woke up the next morning and immediately called in sick to the grocery store. I had a mission, and no amount of responsibility was going to keep me from it. Pulling up Google Maps on my laptop, I retraced my path from yesterday, following the exact route the detour took me. The roads were all there, just as I remembered, but there was no turn-off, no road leading to the town. Frustrated, I pulled up my town's history. I found out it was incorporated from land once owned by a millionaire named Joseph Leary, who died in 1890 while trying to haul a load of lumber to build some sort of safari park in the Midwest. The land was eventually settled in 2000 after being sold from Leary's descendants, but there was no mention of any other towns or settlements nearby.

Before I could find more answers, my phone lit up with a call from Luke. ""Feeling better, buddy?"" he asked, his voice thick with the mock concern of a disappointed parent.
""What are you talking about?"" I replied, genuinely confused.

Luke chuckled. ""You totally greened out last night. Talking about some hidden town that's like a perfectly preserved time capsule from the '80s.""

I pinched the bridge of my nose, sighing. ""Look, man, I know what I saw. If you want to see for yourself, get your ass over here and bring a McGriddle and a hash brown."" I knew that even if he didn't believe me, the chance of a place like that existing was too tempting an opportunity for him to pass up. Plus, I knew that asshole didn’t have anything better to do. Being unemployed and all.

""Okay, okay, I'm putting my clothes on,"" he said. ""Be right over.""

Once we were fed and equipped, we set off in my car toward the mystery town. Luke kept his phone out, scrolling through maps and forums. ""Dude, you're so full of shit,"" he said, laughing sarcastically. ""There's no town or anything near where you told me.""

I gripped the steering wheel tight. ""I don't care what you think. I saw it with my own eyes. I felt it. I even smelled the damn air. There is a town in the middle of the woods untouched. And you're just mad that I found a cool, untouched, abandoned town and you didn't.""

To this he scoffs and says,

“I think your pen is laced, and you were having intense hallucinations.” He switches to a mocking Cockney accent and says, “You imagined seeing these things, and now you’re dragging me along in your drug-fueled quest to find the hidden village.” 

I pressed the brake suddenly, causing him to jolt forward in his seat, his seatbelt catching him and whipping his head down. His iced coffee spilled partially on his stomach and onto his pants. 

“You asshole!” He shrieked, frantically wiping away the light brown droplets from his shirt and crotch, while I belly laughed in the driver seat.

After Luke finished wiping up his spilled coffee, his mood soured. The rest of the drive was quiet, save for his quiet curses and the sound of the car stereo. I kept my eyes peeled for the turn-off, and to my relief, there it was—that same unassuming lane cutting into the woods.
I turned onto the road, and Luke’s head immediately snapped up from his phone. ""Hold on, man,"" he said, his voice dropping an octave. ""This road isn’t on the GPS."" 

“I told you!” I exclaimed as I turned onto the unsuspecting road. “You need to learn to trust m—” He cut me off before I could gloat. “This road looks almost brand new,” he stated with a puzzled look.

He was right. The dirt road was free of any ruts or tire marks, almost perfectly clean, as if it had been leveled a few hours ago. We drove for another few minutes before the car's engine began to sputter and die. The dashboard lights flickered once and then went dark. I tried to turn the key again, but all I got was a single, helpless click.

Luke looked at me, his eyes wide. ""What the hell? It was just working.""

""I don't know,"" I said, a pit forming in my stomach. The silence that fell over us was absolute, heavier than any silence I'd ever known. ""We have to walk. It can't be far from here.”

We got out of the car and began the trek down the unnaturally clean road. The trees on either side stood tall and straight, casting long, uniform shadows that made it feel like we were in a tunnel. We spoke in hushed tones, our voices swallowed by the oppressive quiet.
Suddenly, a wave of sound washed over us, so jarring it made us both jump. It was the low murmur of dozens of conversations, a symphony of voices and tones. The sound was disembodied, as if it were coming from a hidden source, but as we walked on, it grew louder and more distinct. We looked at each other, our confusion replaced by a shared sense of disbelief.

A few minutes later, the woods opened up, and there it was. The town was exactly as I had seen it, but it was bustling with people. They were walking down the sidewalks, chatting on front porches, and tending to their perfectly manicured lawns. Everything was spotless, from the paint on the houses to the clothes on their backs. The only thing missing was cars; not a single vehicle was parked on the perfectly clean streets.

Luke just stood there, speechless. The chatter was all around us now, a chorus of voices that seemed too loud for the small space. He looked at me, his face pale.
""What is this place?"" he finally whispered.
I had no answer.

We both just stood there, staring at the impossible sight in front of us. Luke's disbelief had completely vanished, replaced by a pale, wide-eyed terror. The town was alive. People walked down the sidewalks with deliberate grace. Their smiles were plastered on their faces, frozen and perfect, and their eyes seemed to stare through us, not at us. The conversations were a low, rhythmic hum that reverberated throughout the otherwise silent town.

""This is not real,"" Luke whispered, his voice trembling. ""What is this place?""
Before I could answer, a pale woman approached us. She was dressed in a pristine floral dress, her hair fixed in a perfect bun on top of her head. Her smile was the widest of all, but her eyes were different. They didn't seem to ever focus on a single point, as if both were moving independently, trying their best to synchronize. ""Hello, gentlemen,"" she said, her voice a little too sweet, a little too loud. ""You boys seem lost.""

She didn't wait for us to answer. She just held out a hand, gesturing to the town square. ""We don't get many visitors here in Haven,"" she continued, her head tilted at a strange, unnatural angle. ""Please, let us show you around. Stay for a while.""

As she spoke, others began to turn and face us. The low hum of conversations died down, replaced by a dozen pairs of eyes focused on us. They had the same impossibly wide smiles and vacant stares. Luke took a shaky step back.

""I think we should go,"" he said, his voice barely a breath.

“Nonsense,” the pale lady said, her smile barely even wavering. “Don’t be shy. Haven has so much to offer. With her porcelain-colored hand, she gestured to the town ahead. “Let me show you our little slice of paradise.”
Against our better judgment, or rather, against Luke's frantic protests and my own growing dread masked by a strange curiosity, we were shown through the town. The woman, who introduced herself as Margaret, led the way, her movements graceful and deliberate. The other residents of Haven fell into step around us, their smiles fixed, their eyes still unsettlingly unfocused. A small crowd forming in our midst.

Margaret pointed out the meticulously kept gardens, the perfectly painted houses, and the silent, empty streets. ""Our town is a haven, you see,"" she chirped, her voice almost melodic. ""A place where everything is always as it should be.""

We passed the general store I had explored the day before, its ""OPEN"" sign still hanging. It looked the same, perfectly frozen in time, but now there were figures moving inside, their smiles mirroring those on the street. They paused their silent restocking of shelves and hushed transactions to watch us pass.
Next, we walked by the school; the red kickball in the four-square court was being tossed around by four children. The playground was full of kids, their laughter strangely muted, their movements synchronized as they swung on the swings and slid down the slide. They waved at us with identical, polite gestures.
""Our children are always well-behaved,"" Margaret said proudly. ""They understand the importance of harmony.""

The whole time, the low hum of conversation persisted, a background drone to Margaret's cheerful narration. It was the sound of many voices saying nothing of substance, a constant stream of random greetings and nonsensical rambling. Luke kept trying to pull me away, whispering frantic pleas to escape, but the silent, smiling crowd hemmed us in, their presence a gentle but inescapable barrier.
""See?"" Margaret said, stopping in the town square, where the flagpole stood motionless. ""Isn't it lovely? Doesn't it feel...peaceful?""
I had to admit, there was a strange sort of beauty to the stillness, a visual perfection that was undeniably captivating. But beneath the surface, a deep unease churned in my stomach. It was too perfect, too quiet, too...controlled.

""Where are the cars?"" Luke blurted out, his voice cracking with tension. ""Why isn't anyone driving?""

Margaret simply smiled, her unfocused eyes drifting past him. ""We have no need for such things in Haven. We have everything we need right here. Don’t we, Julian?"" she said as her eyes tried to meet mine.

The woman's smile didn't waver, but her words felt like a key turning in a lock. Luke grabbed my arm, his grip like a vise. ""Julian, we have to go. Now!”

We turned and started walking backward, our eyes locked on her. The other people in the town, who had been standing still, began to move. They weren't running or even walking fast. It was a slow, fluid advance, a coordinated drift that made the crowd feel like a single being. Their unnervingly perfect smiles were fixed on us. Their eyes, moving independently, seemed to be calculating our every move.

Margaret took another step toward us, her voice a low, soothing hum. ""There's no need to be frightened. We just want to make you feel at home."" She held her hands out, gesturing to the silent town around us. ""After all, you've been so restless, so lost. Wouldn't you like to finally find your way home?""

Her question hit me with the force of a physical blow. She wasn't talking about the detour or the drive. She was talking about my restlessness, my constant search for a place that was quiet and untouched. My sacred find. The town hadn't just appeared; it had called to me. It knew what I wanted.

""We have everything you could ever need right here,"" she said, her head tilting to the side. The people behind her, a wall of smiling faces, followed the motion in unison. All together they said, ""No more looking, no more searching. Just perfect stillness.""

I didn't wait to see more. We both bolted, not even bothering to look back. The perfectly clean streets that had seemed so beautiful just moments ago now felt like a terrifying, open plain. The silence was gone, replaced by the unified rhythm of footsteps behind us, a synchronized pounding that sounded less like a chase and more like a stampede.

Luke shrieked, a high-pitched cry of pure terror. ""They're too fast!""

I risked a glance over my shoulder and saw them. They moved with an impossible, unnatural speed, their faces still frozen in those unnerving smiles. Margaret was at the front, her arms swinging in a wide arc. They weren't running so much as they were gliding, their feet barely seeming to touch the ground.
We rounded a corner, dashing past the general store I had first explored. I knew we couldn't outrun them in the open. I saw an alleyway between two houses and pulled Luke into it. We pressed ourselves against the wall, our chests heaving.

The humming sound I had heard in the movie theater was back, but now it was louder. It was a low, vibrating thrum that seemed to come from the very ground beneath our feet. The walls of the houses felt cold and strangely soft against my back.

A moment later, the people of the town swarmed past the entrance to the alley, their silent pursuit a chilling contrast to our panicked breaths. I thought we were safe, but then I looked at the end of the alley. It was blocked. A solid brick wall now stood where a small fence had been just minutes before.
The air grew colder. The humming grew louder, and I could feel the vibrations in my bones. I glanced back at the street. The perfect, smiling faces were now turning toward our hiding place, their synchronized heads tilting in unison. They knew we were here. We were trapped.

The brick wall was solid, and the rhythmic, synchronized footsteps of the townspeople grew louder with every second. Luke let out a guttural sob, his shoulders shaking. ""We're trapped,"" he choked out, his eyes wide with a horrifying realization.

I looked at the walls of the alley, the brick and siding looking too perfect, too clean. The humming sound was so loud now it felt like a bass note, a vibration I could feel in my chest. The walls of the houses on either side of us seemed to bulge and shift, the shadows twisting into shapes that were not quite right. The town wasn't just a place; it was a living, thinking thing, and it was closing its fist around us.

A moment later, the first of them entered the alley. It was Margaret, her face a mask of that perfect, unsettling smile. She was followed by a dozen more. They didn't run at us. They simply walked, their heads tilted in unison, their eyes unmoored and staring past us.
Luke and I braced ourselves, but their movements were unnervingly gentle. Two men took hold of Luke, their grip cold and firm, and a woman on either side of me took my arms. They held us tight, their hands as cold and clammy as a raw chicken breast. Their smiles never wavered.

""We told you not to be frightened,"" Margaret said, her voice still unnaturally sweet. ""There's no need for that here. You've come home. Now, let's get you two settled.""

We were forced out of the alley and back into the town square, the bright sunlight casting long, strange shadows. The people of Haven surrounded us, a silent, smiling crowd, and we were led toward the town hall, which now felt less like a building and more like the entrance to a cage.

We were led inside and down a long, immaculate hallway to a room that looked like a large, brightly lit common area. The air smelled of old paper and something sickly sweet. The group of people stopped, holding us in place. Margaret stepped forward, her unsettling smile a permanent fixture. The other townspeople stood in silence, their eyes fixed on us.
Luke struggled against the two men holding him. ""Let go of me, you fucking freak! What is this place? You're all insane!""

The woman's smile tightened just a fraction. ""We're not insane. We're a family. Haven is a family. We're all here, together, always.""
""Who are you?"" I asked, ignoring Luke's frantic struggles. ""And what do you want?""

""I am a vessel for the town,"" she replied, her gaze seeming to drift between my eyes. ""And so are they. We all are. We were lost, just like you, but the town found us. Haven brings us all together, unites us. It needs more. More life, more peace, more stillness.""

""It's not still; it's dead!"" Luke yelled, his voice cracking. ""There are no cars, no modern anything! This place is a museum, not a town!""
The woman shook her head slowly. ""The outside world is the museum. A museum of chaos and noise. Here, we are perfect. The town makes sure of it. Haven protects us from the world, and we, in turn, become a part of it. A perfect, unified consciousness.""

I stared at her, trying to comprehend the impossible. ""What happens to people who... become a part of it?""

Her smile widened again. ""Oh, you will be so happy. The town will take your memories, your worries, and your anxieties. It will put them all to rest. You will become a part of us, and we will become a part of you. You will find that perfect stillness you’ve been looking for. Forever.""

Luke finally broke free of his captors, stumbling backward. ""No! I'm not doing this! I'm not becoming one of your dolls!"" He screamed, his eyes wide with a horrifying realization.

The woman's head tilted to the side. ""It is not your choice. Haven is hungry, and you are here now. It will take what it wants, and you will give it willingly. You will be one of us.""

As she spoke, the people behind us began to move, their bodies swaying in a low, hypnotic rhythm. The humming sound was back, louder than ever. It was coming from all of them at once, a collective vibration that echoed the woman's words and seemed to fill the room with a palpable sense of dread.

The humming was a growing pressure, a low, resonant drone that felt like a sound wave and a physical touch all at once. My mind screamed in protest, but I couldn't tear my eyes from Margaret's.

""You've been searching for it your whole life, Julian,"" she said, her voice cutting through the noise. ""The quiet. The stillness. It's the only thing you've ever really wanted.""

Her smile widened. ""Did you really think it was a detour that brought you here? An accident? Oh, my dear boy. The signs you followed... they were never real. Haven simply gave you what you were looking for. We saw your desire, your need for stillness, and we showed you the way.""

A cold, sick feeling washed over me, a greater terror than any chase. The town hadn't just appeared; it had created a path for me, a suggestion whispered into my mind until it became a reality. It had lured me here, knowing I would be the perfect specimen.

""Why me?"" I choked out a desperate plea. ""How could you have known?""

The woman's head tilted. ""The stillness you seek, the peace you crave…it's all an escape. A place to run from the noise that shaped you. A place to hide from the screams, from the slamming doors, and from the angry shouts that followed you from childhood. You spent your life hiding in closets, Julian, just to find a single moment of quiet. That's why you explore abandoned places. You weren't looking for history; you were looking for a place he could never find you.”

Luke lunged at her, screaming, ""Get away from him! You crazy bitch!"" But before he could reach her, the people around us moved as one, their arms like perfectly synchronized pistons. They grabbed Luke and dragged him away, his frantic cries swallowed by the humming.
I tried to turn, to fight, but the two people holding me were unnaturally strong. They began to pull me, their cold hands unyielding as they led me deeper into the building. The walls began to pulse, and the floor felt soft beneath my feet. We were no longer on solid ground. We were descending.

The air grew heavy, thick with the scent of pine and something else, something metallic and sweet. We were in a vast, echoing space. It was not a building or a room, but a cavernous, dark chamber. I looked up and saw that the ceiling was made of the same pulsing, organic material I had glimpsed earlier, with a low, vibrating light filtering through its surface. We were in Haven's belly. 

The walls around us began to throb, a deep, sickening rhythm that I could feel in my bones. A thick, viscous liquid oozed from the seams, collecting in dark pools on the wet ground below. Dark veins pulse with every move. The metallic, sweet smell intensified, and a low, resonant drone filled my head. It was the sound of the town, not a hum but a collective, biological roar.

My legs went jelly. I crumpled to the ground, and the pulsing floor seemed to reach up to catch me, its surface soft and sticky. I felt a tingling sensation spread through my skin, followed by a burning warmth that moved deep into my muscles. My body was changing. The bones in my fingers felt like they were liquefying, my muscles dissolving, and my very skin being pulled and stretched.

I watched in horrified fascination as the two people holding Luke suddenly released him. He stumbled, gasping for air, and then looked down at his own hands. The skin was rippling, bubbling, like water coming to a boil. His bones seemed to melt, his fingers shrinking and fusing together. His body began to contort, his limbs twisting into a grotesque, inhuman shape. He opened his mouth to scream, but no sound came out—only a low, vibrating hum, a sound I knew was being absorbed into the very walls around us. His eyes, wide with terror, were the last part of him to go before his form dissolved into a grotesque, fleshy puddle on the pulsing floor. The puddle was then absorbed, leaving nothing behind.

I could feel my memories being drained from me, not as a mental act, but as a physical one. I saw my father's angry face, his mouth open in a silent scream. The image wasn't fading; it was being sucked from my mind, devoured by the buzzing presence all around me. A feeling of profound calm washed over the terror, easing the pain. I was becoming nothing. My fears, my identity, my very existence. All being taken away, washed over by a quiet that was finally, completely absolute.

And I had found my perfect stillness.

1mw0dyi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mw0dyi,Everything I’ve Done The Past 5 Days In My Home Machine Shop,"1. I spent a few hours mocking up valvetrain and modifying titanium/inconel valve prints for a 997 GT3 standing mile car

2. Made a gameplan on fixing the previously mentioned GT3 heads which includes a valve job, surfacing both head gasket and cam tower surfaces on the heads because someone cut them crooked and the cam tower surfaces are twisted. Oh and I have to recut o-ring grooves for a .040” wire o ring which I think is a stupid way of sealing cylinder pressure, but whatever it will work.

3. When I refresh/modify Frankenstein heads I often cut them for 50° Valvejobs and I cut two back cuts on the intake valves when I do that.

4-7. LT1 Gen V heads came in from a local machine shop that had a crooked helicoil installed in it that was also loose. The only way to fix it was to cut everything back out, weld it up, and remachine. This was kind of a pain in the ass because the rocker position is canted and rotated a few degrees on the gen v engines so had to get creative. I ultimately ended up being successful and decided to install helicoils in the hole (3 of them stacked) at full depth which was 1” total. I’ve been experimenting with a harder alloy aluminum filler rod and am finding that it machines like crap despite being nice and hard, so I don’t think I’ll keep using it for repairs like this, just gonna use it for deck repairs from now on.

8. Inspected an AFR LS6 head another machine shop send over for a chamber repair. It’s not that bad, just needs a little welding, some seats, and a spark plug repair. Couple hours and that will be done.

9. Ported a set of FE heads. I’ve ported multiple hundreds of these heads, it bores me, it’s brainless. I can do it with my eyes closed. I watched two episodes of alien earth, south park, and about half of Anthony Bourdain’s Kitchen Confidential on audiobook.

10. I ate local cheese and cheap salami from costco

11. I drank great coffee with a phenomenal apple fritter that was also still warm that the donut shop behind my house does. She does a great job every time. Also bought $5 croissants and dipped that in my coffee too.

12. Tacos… tacos with tripas.

13. Valve jobbed some goofy late 90’s VW 2.0 head that didn’t have a combustion chamber.

14. The same goofy head assembled, the valves cleaned up great.

15. My neighbor brought me two new 40hp Briggs and Stratton heads to replace the blown up ones that came off of his $12,000 hotrod crate motor he bought for his duck hunting boat. 100% would not recommend spending $12,000 on a briggs from some guru marine engine builder. Also found it hilarious that they ended up parked next to a really expensive Porsche while waiting their turn.

16. Another machine shop in town had a really hard time installing valve seats on a piece of shit Neon SRT4 head, they decided loctite was a must have in addition to a press fit. That didn’t work out well for them and I was asked to remove their seats that weren’t installed all the way down because they peeled aluminum and packed it under every seat. Got the poorly installed seats removed and replacement seats ordered in the next oversize and they’re now going to have to go up in valve size because the seats I could get weren’t perfect matches and they’re going to have the open up the exhaust throats by .140” to get back to a 90% valve percentage. 

17-19. I finished a basic restoration on a Toyota 4AGE and was pleased to find that despite the engine being parked outside in the elements for decades, the water damage was very minimal and the head needed the absolute basics to be road worthy again.

20. I went to a new lake club by my house that’s definitely targeting the adjacent golf course crowd. Good drinks, mediocre gentrified falafel for people who have never had a falafel before.",5,1755747869.0,EngineBuilding,1,1.0,False

CREAMY STRAWBERRY po pala yung nasa middle

Spanish latte (Decaf)- 9/10 (Too sweet for me, I like more coffee taste)

beef (I forgot what its called)- 8/10 (Malambot but too salty for me) 289 ata yon (Mas worth it pa to kesa sa liempo na natry namin before) Kasya rin ata to for at least 2-4 heads depende kung gaano ka gutom

Rice- 25 pesos

All drinks that i've tried is actually good, but I think if you're not into sweet drinks then maybe you can try to ask if pwede ilessen yung sugar level.

For its price and taste, i'll give it 9/10 kasi affordable and good service naman. Wala nga lang parking. They have Wifi, so I think good for studying din yung place.

I also hope that this business will keep its quality sa food and drinks but will improve.

1mw0cth,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_DirtyAndPoor/comments/1mw0cth/i_loved_my_father_but_he_came_back/,I Loved My Father but He Came Back,"I always believed we needed to let go of the ones we've lost, no matter how much it hurts. But no one warned me what to do if they came back—how grief, pain, and sorrow, things I was so sure were real, could suddenly feel like lies.

I was seven when he died. Back then, I never truly understood how much his presence meant to me. The memory of his last days still haunts me: the antiseptic hospital smell, the hushed murmurs of passing nurses, and his last words, perfectly clear despite his weakness: ""Take care of your mother for me, buddy."" After they took him away, I found Mom on her knees in the hallway after the doctors spoke to her. I remember thinking how strange it was to see an adult break that way.

Life blurred after his death. Mom crumbled, and I learned to raise myself - cooking, homework, childhood crises.

Some nights, I'd find her in Dad's armchair, still in work clothes, staring at his photo. She'd kiss me back to bed, her tears marking my forehead despite her mumbled excuses about dust.

Growing up without him was difficult, but we managed. The years passed, and we settled into our routine. I kept his memory alive in small ways—wearing his broken watch, using his old things. Mom said grief does that, though she never explained why. Maybe we're both still figuring it out.

As I got older, the memories of him began to fade. His eyes... I couldn't remember if they were brown or hazel. Mom kept his photos, but somehow, they never seemed to capture him in the right light. I held onto them as a reminder.

Then came that day in my sophomore year when everything changed. Walking home that crisp autumn day, a familiar scent stopped me—applewood smoke, though no one on our street had a working fireplace anymore. At the corner, our house looked wrong. Time seemed to have reversed itself: Dad's bluebells swayed in the dead garden—spring flowers in autumn—and his wind chimes sang without wind.

The scent hit me as I opened the front door—fresh coffee and pancakes. We hadn't had coffee made here in years. From the living room came a sound I'd almost forgotten—Mom's genuine laughter, accompanied by a deeper voice that made my heart stutter.

The hallway stretched endlessly. Dad's cardigan hung on the banister—warm to touch. His crossword puzzle lay unfinished, the pen still warm, his shoes exactly where he always left them. Each detail clicked into place with terrifying precision.

In the living room, Mom curled against him on the couch. There sat my father, impossibly real—reading glasses perched on his nose, that untamable eyebrow, even the coffee stain Mom always scolded him about.

""Welcome home, buddy,"" he said.

Mom beamed beside him, her hand in his, looking younger than she had in years. The weight of grief seemed to have melted away. She looked at him the way she used to, the way I'd almost forgotten—like he was her entire world.

""Dad?"" I whispered, my voice shaking not from terror but from the weight of what I was seeing.

He smiled at me with that slightly crooked incisor he'd chipped playing baseball when he was twelve. ""I missed you so much,"" he said, his voice catching slightly, exactly the way it used to when he was trying not to cry.

Mom announced dinner was ready, casual as anything. The smell of his favorite meatloaf drifted from the kitchen—the recipe his mother had passed down, the one Mom had never quite mastered in all the years since. But now it smelled perfect.

I couldn't move. Because I remembered holding my father's cold hand at the funeral. I remembered watching them lower his casket into the ground. I remembered nine years of grieving, of missing him, of learning to live without him. And here he was, impossible but real.

I backed into the door. ""How are you here?"" My voice cracked. Dad's face shifted to that familiar concerned expression as he stepped forward, hands open—exactly how he'd approach my childhood tantrums.

""What's wrong, buddy?"" His voice held that perfect mix of worry and love I'd fought to remember. Mom appeared, wiping her hands on her anniversary apron—the one that should have been yellowed with age but looked brand new.

I kept my distance, the door my anchor to reality. Everything felt real. That was the problem. I looked at my mother—really looked at her. She looked happy. Genuinely, completely happy, in a way I hadn't seen since before the hospital.

I wanted to run, to escape, yet I couldn't leave her here with... with whatever this was. Even if it felt like Dad. Even if it smiled like him and moved like him and remembered everything exactly right. I lunged forward and grabbed her hand.

""Mom, we have to go,"" I said, pulling her toward the door. She resisted, her eyes filling with tears.

""Honey, what's gotten into you?"" Her voice broke just like it used to when I disappointed her. ""Why are you trying to ruin this? We're finally whole again.""

I dragged her outside, past the garden where those impossible bluebells bloomed. The street was empty except for the glow from neighbors' windows. Mom fought against me, repeating ""it's okay"" over and over. When I looked back, my father—or whatever wore his face—stood in our doorway, watching us with that familiar hurt expression.

""Mom, please,"" I begged. ""He died. You remember the funeral. You remember everything after.""

But my words faltered as she looked at me with genuine confusion. ""What are you talking about? Your father's right there. He's always been here."" She touched my forehead like checking for a fever. ""Are you feeling okay? You've been working so hard at school lately...""

""No... he's dead. Mom, he's dead..."" The words felt less certain now, seeing him there in the doorway, looking exactly as a father should when worried about his child. Everything I remembered about the funeral seemed to blur, like a dream fading in the morning light.

His footsteps on the path carried that familiar unevenness from his old injury. ""Come on, buddy. Let's go home. Whatever's bothering you, we can figure it out together. We always do.""

I felt something in my mind shift as his footsteps drew closer. Slowly, each memory of my father began adjusting to accept this new reality. ""Son,"" he said, and his voice carried all the warmth I'd been missing for nine years.

""He's dead,"" I whispered, but even as I said it, I noticed Mom's expression—patient, waiting, like she knew exactly what I was going through, like she'd made this choice before. But I couldn't accept this. I wouldn't disrespect my father's memory, the hardship we'd faced. The pain we'd endured.

""Please Mom, wake up. This isn't real,"" I said as I tried to pull her, but this time I couldn't move. No, the truth was I wouldn't move—my body betraying me.

""Your father's been worried about you,"" she said softly. Her eyes met mine, and for a moment—just a moment—I saw everything there. Understanding. Grief. Choice. ""Sometimes,"" she added carefully, ""happiness is right in front of us, if we just... let it be.""

He was closer now, and I could smell his aftershave—the same brand I'd kept unopened in my drawer for years. Yet the memory felt uncertain now, like trying to hold onto water. I tried to remember the funeral, but the images kept shifting, then fading.

""Do you remember how he used to push you on the swings?"" Mom asked, her voice gentle. ""How he never pushed too high because you were scared of heights?""

""Every Sunday,"" Dad added, and suddenly I could see it clearly—the creak of the swing set, his hands steady on my back, my laughter carrying across the yard. Had that happened before or after? Did it matter anymore?

I looked at him—really looked. He wasn't perfect. There were new wrinkles around his eyes that my memories hadn't included. His hair was slightly grayer than in the photos. He looked... lived in. Real. Like he'd been aging alongside us all this time.

""Dad?"" I said again, but this time it wasn't a question born of fear.

Something in my mind whispered that this was wrong, that there was another set of memories trying to claim space—cold hands, a casket, years of absence. But those memories felt distant now, like a dream I'd once had. This felt real—his smile, Mom's hand in mine, the smell of dinner waiting at home.

""Come on, buddy,"" he said, holding out his hand. ""Your mom's lasagna is getting cold.""

I looked at Mom one last time. There was something in her eyes—knowledge, maybe, or understanding. A tiny nod, so slight I might have imagined it. A choice being offered.

I took his hand. It was warm.

That night, my reflection caught my eye—something questioning in my gaze. Then Dad called about tomorrow's fishing trip—the one we'd planned for weeks, the one we'd always done, every year, forever—and I let the doubt slip away.

After all, why question happiness?

Dad's home. He's always been home.

And if sometimes, late at night, I remember another life—well, that's just a bad dream. Mom says they fade.

1mw0ciq,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_DirtyAndPoor/comments/1mw0ciq/im_beginning_to_love_my_wife_help/,I’m Beginning to Love My Wife. Help?,"Hey everyone! It's been a while since I posted here. I won't bother with introductions - I just need to share this while I still can. Before my mind gets filled with more things, I can't explain... I don't even know how long I'll remain me

Love stories usually start with a chance meeting, don't they? Mine began this year, when I met the woman of my dreams. Literally - she was everything I'd ever dreamed of, down to the smallest detail. We shared every interest, finished each other's sentences, laughed at the same jokes. Perfect matches like that don't really happen, do they? I should have wondered about that.

Her accent marked her as foreign, though I could never quite place where from. When our eyes met across the café, she approached first, her voice like warm honey in my ears. We talked for hours, the world fading around us. She mentioned she was new to the city, staying at a hostel while looking for a place. Something in her voice made my heart ache when she described her struggles to find somewhere permanent.

Without thinking, I offered her a place to stay - my apartment had a spare room, after all. Looking back, who offers their home to a complete stranger? But at the time, it felt as natural as breathing. It was like the words came from my mouth before my brain could process them, yet somehow it felt like the most obvious thing in the world.

It wasn't until weeks later that I realized something odd - she had known my name from the start, though I never introduced myself. When this thought surfaced, it slipped away just as quickly, like trying to hold onto a dream after waking.

Then came the dreams. Night after night, I'd jolt awake, heart racing, certain she was beside me. Those sweet eyes of hers would be fixed on my face, her lips moving in whispers of a language I couldn't quite grasp. But when I truly woke, everything was normal - our usual morning routine, her in the kitchen cooking, me sitting down, waiting to be served. When did that become normal? When did I start forgetting what my life was like before her?

God, what happened to me? Since when was I this hopeless romantic? The guy who used to stammer just asking for coffee directions, now living with a beautiful stranger? My old friends would laugh if they saw me - if I still talked to them. When did I stop talking to them?

Her family appeared next, insisting on meeting me. They shared her strange accent, their voices carrying the same melodic quality that made my thoughts go fuzzy around the edges. ""Isn't she perfect for you?"" they'd ask, their smiles warm and inviting. ""You two were meant to be together."" Within a week, we were dating. Within a month, they were planning our wedding.

Can you believe that? Our wedding. The thought should have shocked me more. I hadn't even told my sister - the same sister who'd interrogate me for hours about any girl I so much as smiled at. The sister who called every Sunday without fail. When was the last time I answered her calls?

I remember catching my reflection one morning - something seemed different about my eyes. The color maybe? Or was it something deeper, something in the way they followed her movement like a sunflower tracking the sun? The thought vanished before I could grasp it, like everything else that didn't fit into her perfect world.

Then I met her relatives who came to visit. The way they welcomed me, with such genuine warmth and affection - like I was already part of their family. The children were... different though. They would stare with those unnaturally still eyes, pointing and whispering in their language: ""Again... new brother... good? Old brother... gone..."" I didn't understand then. I wish I still didn't.

Our wedding happened so fast - one month after meeting. One month. Even writing this, I feel my mind splitting in two. Part of me wonders why I rushed into marriage with a near-stranger, while another part insists it was the most natural thing in the world. How did none of my family attend? Why didn't I invite them? These questions feel like trying to grasp smoke.

My mind was too much in a haze during those days. Each question that surfaced in my mind would dissolve like morning mist. There are whole weeks I can't recall, places I don't remember going to, yet somehow, I ended up there. Then they brought me to their family estate - a sprawling property just two hours from the city. The roads getting there grew narrower, the houses fewer, until we turned onto a private drive I would've missed if not for my wife's direction.

The honeymoon started normally enough. Despite being so close to civilization, the thick woods surrounding their property made it feel like we were in another world. The isolation should have bothered me, but like everything else about her, it felt right. She was the perfect wife, anticipating my every need, her love wrapping around me like a warm blanket. Too warm. Too perfect.

When did I start losing myself in her eyes? When did her voice begin to drown out my own thoughts? Sometimes I'd catch her watching me sleep, her fingers tracing patterns in the air above my skin. The next morning, my arms would itch, though I saw no marks.

By this point in our marriage, six months had passed. Their discussions had become a constant backdrop to my life - warm family conversations in corners, joyous celebrations I couldn't understand, those affectionate exchanges between my wife and her mother that would shift to English the moment I entered a room. The frustration of being surrounded by all this love yet missing half of it started to crack through the haze of contentment they had wrapped around me. Even in my love-addled state, something in me yearned to be part of every aspect of my new family.

That's when I had what I thought was a brilliant idea. I would learn their language in secret. Their genuine warmth and inclusion in everything else made me want to understand every word, every joke, every story they shared. Maybe it was the desire to truly be part of this loving family, or maybe some part of me was still fighting to understand what was happening. Whatever drove me, I began my study.

For four months, I carefully learned their tongue. I used children's reading books, noting down phrases I heard during our family gatherings. I looked forward to surprising them all, imagining their delighted reactions when I could finally join their conversations fully. The strange thing was - even as their words began making sense, so did other things. Things I hadn't wanted to understand. Each translation brought clarity, like pieces of a puzzle I hadn't known I was solving.

Time flowed strangely after that. While I was nearly caught studying one night, my wife brought up something new. She insisted I get tribal tattoos. ""Family tradition,"" they said, showing me intricate tribal designs that seemed to dance in the candlelight. They looked beautiful, and I agreed without hesitation. Looking back, I wonder if my growing understanding of their language had weakened whatever spell they had over me, because for the first time, I noticed how their eyes gleamed when I said yes.

The way their loving gazes carried something else beneath the surface. Those concerned whispers between family members, always followed by reassuring smiles. The children's seemingly innocent chatter that held darker meanings. Everything started making terrible sense.

One night, I overheard her speaking with her mother: ""Dear... it's time... prepare... he's... yours... final... perfect... love."" Their sweet smiles felt different now that I understood their words. The children's warnings made horrible sense. Each ""new brother"" before me, where had they gone? What happened to the ""old brothers""?

After piecing everything together, I knew I had to leave. Even if I was misunderstanding something, I couldn't take the risk of staying to find out. My skin burned where the tattoos were, and sometimes in the mirror, I swore I saw them moving, tracing patterns I'd seen in their ancient books.

I made an excuse about needing to sleep as I was too tired. They were deep in their discussion and made the fatal mistake of letting me go. I grabbed everything I could - power bank, phone, food, blankets, and anything else that might help me survive. My hands shook as I packed, and I tried to ignore how my fingernails had started to look different - longer, darker, more like hers.

I ran. That's where I am now - hiding in these woods, trying to ignore how the tattoos glow through my clothes. The air is freezing, but I feel warm. Too warm. There's a smell like metal and roses rising from my skin, but that can't be right. Can it?

Darkness is falling by now. The familiar city lights are probably visible somewhere beyond these woods, but I can't find my way through their property. The trees all look the same, and somehow, I keep circling back. I've found shelter against a massive tree, using its thick roots as a shield. But I'm not sure how long I can stay here.

The tattoos - they're whispering now, calling me back. The metallic smell grows stronger, mixing with something sweet and familiar - her perfume. My phone sits useless in my hand. I should call someone, but my fingers won't dial. My thoughts keep slipping away, replaced by memories of her smile, her voice, her touch. No, those aren't my thoughts. That's not me. Sorry, that's not me.

I hear footsteps crunching through the snow behind me. Soft. Familiar. Perfect.

""What are you writing there, dear?"" Her voice flows like honey, and my body turns toward it without my permission. Frost falls from my face - when did that start happening?

""Just my story, sweetheart. Don't worry."" The words leave my mouth, but they don't feel like mine anymore. Were they ever mine?

""Why don't we go home?"" she asks, and I feel my mind clouding over with warmth and love and surrender. The last thing I see as I turn to her is my reflection in her eyes - my own eyes now the same impossible color as hers.

1mw0c6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_DirtyAndPoor/comments/1mw0c6k/the_last_hour/,The Last Hour,"My hands shake as I write these words, knowing they might be my last. The countdown to my death has begun - don't ask me how I know this. I just do.

It echoes in my skull louder with each passing moment, and when I close my eyes, I hear it clearly: tick, tick, tick. A clock measuring out my final moments. This nightmare has devoured my days, driving me to acts I never thought myself capable of. The ticking never stops. Even now, it reverberates through my bones, growing louder with each passing second.

I screamed at Mom yesterday. She just brought soup, asked about dinner. ""Sweetheart, you're scaring me,"" she whispered. That look in her eyes... God, Mom, if you only knew how scared I am. Now I'm in my closet, shoved the dresser against the door. Stupid, right? trying to block death with this beaten-up dresser.

This all began a month ago, after the crash. They called it a miracle - the kind that makes you question if you're blessed or cursed. Five people died that day, their cars crumpled like paper around mine. Yet I stepped out without a scratch, not even a bruise. The paramedics kept checking and rechecking, convinced they'd missed something. That's when the ticking started. Just a whisper at first, so faint I thought it was tinnitus from the crash. The doctors agreed, said it was normal after trauma. Normal. There's nothing normal about hearing your own countdown.

In quiet moments, the ticking matches my heartbeat. At first, I thought it was just anxiety, stress from the accident making me hyper-aware of time passing. The doctors said it was expected - survivor's guilt, trauma response. Take these pills, they said. Get some rest. But pills might as well be candy, and silence has become my enemy.

I can't stand quiet places anymore. My desk at the office became unbearable - just me, my computer, and death's metronome. Now I work from crowded cafés, busy malls, anywhere with noise. My colleagues think I've become more sociable. The truth? I'm desperate for any sound that might drown out the ticking in my head. The baristas at Downtown Coffee know my order, always giving me the table near their loudest speaker. The music helps, sometimes. But even through the chaos of a hundred conversations, it's still there. Always there. Perfect clarity. Every step. Every breath. Every second.

That's when it began. Strange things. The birds came first, following my every move, staring with blank eyes that reflected only despair. Then came the accidents. Things that usually happen once in a while began happening daily. I slipped... why did I slip? The concrete was dry. Completely dry.

As if that wasn't enough, my eyes started failing me next. These eyes that never missed a thing, that could spot a quarter across the street - they began to betray me. Stepped right into traffic just days before. The car was right there. How did I not see it until I heard the horn?

My boss suggested vacation time. ""You look exhausted,"" she said. If only that was all it was. The time off only made things worse - too much quiet, too much time to notice how the ticking grew louder with each hour that passes. Thoughts I'd been avoiding began surfacing, but I was afraid to reach the obvious conclusion. Perhaps I already knew the answer, just couldn't bear to face it.

My denial didn't last long. But come Tuesday, another crash - a truck this time, swerving into my lane on the highway. Metal screamed, glass shattered everywhere, cars spun and flipped like they weighed nothing. The world turned upside down. Asphalt rushing at my face. Should've died. The paramedics said as much, staring at me like they'd seen a ghost. Three totaled cars. Not a scratch on me. Again.

That night, the ticking changed. Faster, more urgent, like a stopwatch counting down instead of a clock keeping time. I paced my apartment, trying to understand why death's metronome had chosen me. Why it was getting louder. Why it seemed to speed up with each brush with death.

Then came the rat. Just a shadow darting across my kitchen floor, seeking the hole in my wall. I didn't mean to kick it - just a startled reflex. The wet crack against the wall made bile rise in my throat. But when I closed my eyes, something was different. The ticking... softened. Just slightly, but after weeks of listening to it day and night, I noticed.

I found myself staring at the tiny corpse, a horrible thought forming. Was it coincidence? The way the sound dipped after something died? No. No, that was crazy thinking. Had to be. But the thought lingered, whispering possibilities I didn't want to hear.

I've been in this closet for... I don't even know anymore. Time's wrong in here. Hours vanish. Nothing makes sense anymore. The ticking's so loud now I can barely think. Can barely write. My hand keeps shaking.

It stopped. One last time, I closed my eyes and found silence - sweet, terrible silence. This isn't a story anymore, just my last words before... God, I can feel it now. If I'm wrong about all this, I'll laugh it off tomorrow. But if I'm right... Mom, I'm so sorry for every-

I’m 18 M who is going to college in literally two days. The first time I ever had a drink was two/three months ago with friends, and since then I’ve only drank like 2 or 4 other times, each with friends and lightly, just having some fun which I think is fine as a teenager and I believe normal. Seriously nothing serious just like a mikes or two while you play smash bros or playing Irish poker or whatever. 

I didn’t drink before and am against drinking because my dad drinks a lot, well idk how to put it I feel stupid saying he drinks a lot because he’s not violent or bad or anything but hes definetly a chronic drinker, everyday after work he has 2-4 beers, when I was younger it was worse and he’d often pass out on the couch drunk but now it’s just 1-2 beers before bed, so it’s better. And again it’s not like he’s violent or anything, I just have had to deal with the fact that 90% of the time I talk to him he’s drunk or high or both so he’s never fully there and never fully processing anything. That’s a long winded way of saying before 3 months ago I intended to never drink, but then figured having drinks with friends couldn’t hurt, and it turned out to be fun and I don’t see harm in it.

But anyway about a week ago I was talking with a friend while tipsy (probably 5th time ever drinking) and during it we mentioned casually drunk writing, because we were in theater together and both wrote one act plays and we’re basically like “how do people write drunk, that’s crazy”. 
Then last week I decided to give it a shot. Well further context. That day I had a slight argument with my boyfriend and while upset I had a small (literally a tiny tiny drop) of liquor from my basement, because I was sad. That was my first time drinking alone. Then later that night I decided to give tipsy writing a try, and drank for the second time alone. I poured a Coke Zero and Jack Daniel’s from the basement, and just had a glass. And fuck man I flowed, all of my bad thoughts/anxious thoughts blocking my writing melted away and I got like 11 pages of script out, and it was fun. I didn’t even finish the drink because I got tired + the Coke Zero was ass and it was too strong for me.
Today I decided to drink and write again, to get started on scene 2. Or at least I thought that’s why I was doing it, just to write. But I poured myself more Jack Daniel’s than before, and this time had regular coke, and it went down smoother and I drank it a lot lot quicker. I only got two/3 pages down before I had to stop. I felt the alcohol warmth but the problem was that I could also feel my hand moving slower/sloppier and the thoughts weren’t flowing as good, and I just stopped cause I coudlnt.

But I’m realizing (though granted maybe I’m just tipsy (I feel stupid saying I’m drunk because I’m not and I feel like a child saying that after having once drink + I’m still thinking))) maybe I drank more because I’m really fucking stressed, and I was lying to myself about wanting to write. I have been really stressed about going to college, I couldn’t say exactly why just as it approaches each day I literally feel like my hearts like ripping out of my chest and I can barely focus or think. I have anxiety but I never got medicated (well I was given medication in 6th grade but refused to take it) but my anxiety has never been this bad, I’ve started to lose sleep and it’s hard to function at times admittedly and I think maybe that’s why I drank, because it did calm and remove the thoughts and dampen myself and now I’m just warm (though I can feel it fading a little as I write this).

 Anyway all this to conclude on the fact that in my head throughout middle school /high school I’ve known mentally I’m not fully okay. I’m anxious, I think about dying a lot, I get depressed and trouble focusing at times, and feel everyone hates me at times. But I always told myself I could handle it, but the moment I start relying on drugs or anything that I would get therapy or help or something. But then this last year I started drinking coffee everyday because I couldn’t get through the day/focus, but I decided it’s fine, it’s normal even if I never needed it before. And now I’m worried I’ve started drinking. I guess the thought I’m left with is asking myself is it time to get help? I don’t think it is yet, but admittedly it might be soon if I continue this. But I also really like the buzz. Idk, I’m gonna sleep though and I feel good so maybe that’s all that matters.",1,1755747530.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

Title: ""Two Dollars and a Broken Clock""

(Tempo: ~85 BPM — laid‑back strums, space between lines to breathe)

(Verse 1 — AABB rhyme)
I traded yesterday’s vinyl, paid two dollars on the line
Your message on the post‑it—just too late to underline
Walked beneath streetlamps humming songs I used to know
They flicker like your memory, in corners that still glow

(Pre‑Chorus — ABAB rhyme)
And I don’t text, I don’t call, I just trace the cracks in the floor
I guess that’s how you heal—by never touching the door

(Chorus — tighter rhymes, AABB)
My heart runs slow on half‑lit truths, the ones we never spoke
All my words just twist around the edges of your jokes
I’m learning how to lose you without saying you’re gone
So I keep writing these small songs, in case I’m ever wrong

(Verse 2 — AABB rhyme)
That diner booth feels emptier with your ghost pacing the night
Your coffee cup’s still stained with your laugh in this dim light
I dial the jukebox but I always drown in the song
Wish I could skip this part where everything went wrong

(Pre‑Chorus — ABAB)
I don’t reach out, don’t pretend, I’m safe behind my doubt
I guess that’s how it ends—by never turning around

(Chorus — AABB)
My heart runs slow on half‑lit truths, they echo, barely there
All my thoughts are torn‑up notes I know you’d never care
I’m learning how to let go while still holding on tight
So I hum these half‑worn lines into the night’s quiet light

(Bridge — AABB)
There’s a spot where we used to sleep under faded moonlight
Now I pause there just to feel the absence where you’d lie
I swear the street still remembers our crooked lullaby
Even if I never say your name, I sing it when I’m half‑alive

(Final Chorus — AABB, subtle shift)
My heart runs slow on half‑lit truths, beneath the evening hum
Your voice still slips inside these walls, where all our echoes come
I’m learning how to carry what’s gone, in half‑remembered rhymes
So I hold onto broken clocks, just to mark our passing time

(Outro — softly, one line repeated)
Broken clocks keep telling time, repeating time...

I moved to America 3-4 years ago and I i am shocked by the amount of loyalty Americans display towards brands and corporations.
I have lived in many places in the west and east of the world and this habit seems to be more American than anywhere else.
This observation is both negative and positive. For example they have such outrage when a brand does something bad or just blindly have a lot of loyalty and spend their money on brands that are hyped or trendy just because.
For example today in NYC I overheard two friends debating over which of their coffee was better. 1 had Starbucks and the other Dunkin. And I thought imagine being in NYC where you can get the best artisanal coffee from local coffee shops, but you’d rather spend time trying to one-up each other over sloppy corporate coffee?
Anyway, there are a lot more other examples like this across every category but maybe my immigrant mind just doesn’t understand this type of behavior. Why are Americans so loyal to corporations who could care less about them?

1mw07rd,https://i.redd.it/odckocp7makf1.png,Peter Rant,"Look, I’ve come to realize that life is basically just one long string of disasters interrupted by bad coffee. And whenever I’m standing there, staring at my lukewarm cup of sadness, I ask myself: *What would Peter do?*

Peter, mind you, isn’t just any old man. He’s not out here feeding pigeons at the park. No. Peter wakes up, downs a cup of coffee so strong it could strip paint off a Spitfire wing, then casually decides whether he’s going to fly a WWII fighter plane or a Cold War nuclear bomber *for fun*. You and I worry about traffic. Peter worries about whether the Spitfire will fit in the garage next to the Handley Page Victor B-1.

And don’t even get me started on his morals. This man has such impeccable morals that the Ten Commandments ask *him* for advice. He’s armed to the teeth, protected with more guns than a Hollywood action hero, but he’ll only draw them if it’s morally justified—like if someone tries to water down his coffee, or put oat milk in it without asking.

So when the Wi-Fi goes out, when my boss asks me to “circle back,” when someone cuts in front of me at Costco with a shopping cart full of frozen pizzas—I stop, I breathe, and I mutter to myself: *What would Peter do?*

Would he panic? No. Would he whine? Not a chance. He’d sip his coffee, probably shoot a disapproving glance (backed by a small arsenal), and then hop into a bomber jet just to really drive the point home. Because Peter doesn’t compromise. He caffeinates, he calibrates, and then he conquers.

So yeah, when the world feels like it’s falling apart, I’ve only got one mantra left:

I’ll try not to go into too much detail because I don’t want this to be just one sided since my husband can’t speak for himself here.

Our 12 month old is sleep trained but I didn’t night wean so he still wakes up 1-2 times a night and nurses back to sleep. 
Now he has been waking a bit early some days (1 - 1.5hrs before his normal DWT of 7:30). I leave for work at 6:15 so my husband wakes our son and gets him to daycare. 
This morning our son woke up at 6, I let him fuss on and off for 10 minutes, definitely acting like he was ready to get up. I woke my husband up to ask if he wanted me to go try to get our son back to sleep or if he wanted the monitor and he (my husband) could get up if our son didn’t fall back asleep. Husband said to try to get the baby back to sleep. I knew this wasn’t going to work but I didn’t mind being late to work and trying for 15 minutes. When that failed I took our son to my husband in bed who was very annoyed and I left for work. Our son was screaming in our bedroom for a while as I was making coffee and packing up, he likely wanted to nurse more, he’s teething and sick right now.

Okay so then tonight, while in bed, I asked my husband if that was the best solution and shared what I thought would make more sense. I thought it would be better for my husband to go get our son and bring him to bed, rather than our son seeing me and being upset. 
My husband said he’d rather let our son cry for an hour so he could sleep longer, since he can’t take our son to daycare until 8. 

Now I feel like I can’t trust my husband to care for our son for the hour I’m gone in the morning. Am I crazy? ",1,1755747163.0,NewParents,8,0.67,False

Before I started following, I had gotten myself in a bad situation (one of MANY) I was with a friend who I knew relatively well and we were on our way to a town far from mine, no car, no money, so we were hitch hiking. We were doing okay, and while it was a foreign part of the country to me, he was very familiar with the journey, as he had done it many times before. We made it to our destination (me being far from anyone I knew) and nothing he had promised was working out! We had no place to sleep, nothing to eat and it was very late by then. Finally! His cousin had agreed to let us stay the night and we went to his house. The cousin lived with a few flatmates in a place next to a non-descript bar and was having a few drinks. I was only 16 at the time and my ""friend"" was about 19, but I was already drinking and smoking weed at the time so this was all fine, UNTIL the tone changed and they start asking me questions about my manhood and it's size, if I was straight or gay, just getting creepy. Then out of nowhere someone pulled my pants down from behind (I didn't hear him sneak up) and I pulled them up INSTANTLY and ran crying! Now at about 2-3am in a town I had no connections, knew were nothing was and no way to reach my family (to broke for a phone) I was desperate. I was so so hopelessly desperate just to be at home, and at the time me and my mother were very much NOT on good terms and I was to prideful to even reach out to her for help, even if I died (long story). Anyway, It was raining and cold so I found a doorway to a public library and decided to curl into a ball and wait for the morning to try use the computers to sort SOMETHING out! As I was dosing off, while shivering, I silently prayed to any ""God"" that was listening to just please get me home! Flash forward to about 9:30am and I'm awoken to a lady with a coffee for me and she says ""this is for you"", she was on the phone so I just quietly said thank you and took a sip, she then said something that made me spit said sip out ""is your name *says my first name*"" this is surprising because my name is not common. I reply with ""yes how did you know?"" She handed me the phone and said ""it's your mother"". I. WAS. SHOOK. But also greatful to hear her voice. Turns out she had put up a post on multiple Facebook groups asking if anyone had seen me and to call her if they did and the woman did as asked! My mother had no idea were I was, no idea I was cold, scared and alone, and had no idea I wanted to come home as I had been living on my own for a while! But I was home the next day. I asked her how she knew, and she said ""I had a bad feeling!"" Not religious, no indication I wasn't were I was living at the time NOTHING!  She didn't even confirm with my flatmates I wasnt home she just knew at 3am that I needed her help! Still took me about 10 years to become a follower but after I started following I decided to see how much Jesus had saved me before I even acknowledged him and there has been QUITE a few. I have another incredible story about my faith from before I started following with the exact opposite outcome if anyone is interested but I also wanted to start a conversation about this and would LOVE to hear other peoples experience with instant awnsers to prayers when they were needed, the faster awnsers closes to praying the better! Extra points If it was what turned you to Christ or was while you weren't following! Thank you for reading and Forever and ever praise Jesus and AMEN!!!",5,1755747149.0,Christianity,4,1.0,False

In this guide from RAXDOME & RAXTENT we walk through realistic [sizing scenarios](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZm8-nnWAJI&ab_channel=RaxTent), practical trade-offs and deployment tips to help you select the ideal glass dome tent for your terrain, budget and guest expectations.

[glass dome campsite blueprint](https://preview.redd.it/913lam4ckakf1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc03b24a2be3d95b8070d2100d6330206062f286)

For operators who want to boost F&B revenue and create memorable moments, compact glass dome tents in the 4–5m range often make more commercial sense: these units work brilliantly as private dining pods or VIP meeting rooms where the intimacy of a panoramic glass dome drives covers and social sharing without a large footprint.

[4m glass dome tent in the grassland for tea house](https://preview.redd.it/cg98aazckakf1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a0987b47310cd0ee607bc8b4e05205c5c923d3d)

Because they are quick to deploy and easy to multiply across terraces or lawns, [small domes](https://www.raxtent.com/products/4m-5m-clear-glass-dome-tent-for-coffee-shop-and-restaurant) let you scale experiences quickly and affordably while creating many distinct touchpoints for guests to discover and photograph.

When the primary goal is overnight revenue and guest comfort, most owners land in the 6–8m domes. A [6m glamping dome](https://www.raxtent.com/products/6m-7m-geodesic-dome-for-luxury-glamping-with-solid-panel-and-tempered-glass-in-usa) typically provides 28 m² of usable floor area, which designers can arrange as a comfortable bedroom with an en-suite bathroom and a compact kitchenette or lounge.

Slightly larger 7m–8m [geodesic domes](https://www.raxtent.com/products/7m-glass-geodesic-dome-house-for-airbnb-glamping-hotel) add breathing room for a more generous bathroom, a seating area, or — where site height allows — a mezzanine loft that increases usable space without expanding the footprint.

These [mid-size domes](https://www.raxtent.com/products/raxtent-8m-honeycomb-glass-dome-house-for-airbnb-hotel) are the industry sweet spot for boutique glamping: they balance guest comfort, operational simplicity and photogenic appeal, delivering strong average daily rates and repeat bookings when presented as a true glamping dome experience.

For properties seeking flexible programming — seasonal events, workshops, retreats or family suites — domes from 9 to 12 metres open up many possibilities. At this scale a panoramic [glass dome](https://www.raxtent.com/products/12m-hexagonal-glass-dome-tent-honeycomb-shape-glamping-hotel) can be planned with distinct functional zones: a dining and lounge area that converts to event seating, a service core for catering, and a quieter sleeping module.

Larger spans allow for zoned HVAC, full plumbing solutions and integrated AV systems, which make these domes commercially attractive as pop-up restaurants, [yoga studios](https://www.raxtent.com/products/outdoor-12m-transparent-glass-dome-tent-for-yoga-studio-with-loft), or exhibition pavilions. The ability to reconfigure the interior makes these sizes particularly valuable for operators who want multiple revenue lines from one structure.

Moving into pavilion scale, 13–16m domes operate more like small halls: they are right-sized for weddings, immersive exhibits or greenhouse installations where circulation, service access and crowd flow management become central design considerations. At the landmark scale of 17–20m (and above), a glass dome or [large geodesic dome](https://www.raxtent.com/products/raxdome-15m-geodesic-glass-dome-house-for-campsite-restaurant-and-lounge) house becomes a destination feature in its own right.

These very [large domes ](https://www.raxtent.com/products/raxtent-20m-glass-geodesic-dome-tent-for-camping-restaurant-and-retreat-room)can host full-service restaurants, large events and significant exhibitions, but they demand advanced structural detailing and a higher level of project management. RAXDOME and RAXTENT have delivered such large projects internationally; the creative payoff is high, yet owners should be prepared for corresponding CAPEX, specialist installation and a deliberate commissioning process.

Beyond diameter, several operational and site factors should drive your final choice. Soil type and slope determine foundation strategy (timber deck, concrete pad, screw piles or ring foundations); and climate guides glazing, insulation and shading choices — low-E insulated glass with argon fill for cold sites, reflective coatings and external shading for hot, coastal locations. Mechanical systems scale with volume: a 6m dome may only need a compact split AC or basic hydropower system, whereas event or 12m+ domes typically require zoned HVAC, mechanical ventilation and more sophisticated electrical distribution.

[15m glass dome under construction](https://preview.redd.it/mu5vjoctkakf1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ef02ef522578b036d4e37039426c668c4eee75f)

Operational strategy and ROI thinking are equally important. Smaller domes allow greater density and faster turnover, which suits high-volume F&B concepts; mid-size glamping domes often maximize nightly revenue with lower complexity; and large domes convert into event revenue but require marketing, bookings coordination and higher OPEX. To make a sound investment decision, model scenarios — expected ADR (average daily rate), occupancy, staffing and maintenance — and compare revenue per square metre across sizes.

Customization and guest experience details are what turn a dome into a brand asset. Consider privacy strategies (blackout curtains, low-reflectivity glass zones), guest comfort (underfloor heating, under-bed storage, compact kitchen modules), and visibility (stargazing skylights, 270° panoramic glazing). For seaside resorts, treatments for corrosion and drainage are essential; in windy or snowy regions, reinforced aluminum framing and wind-rated glaziniable. Working with an experienced partner like RAXDOME or RAXTENT ensures that these technical choices are aligned with the concept so the final glass dome house or [glamping dome](https://www.instagram.com/p/DKhhJyhSwS4/) performs beautifully for years.

Choosing the right geodesic glass dome size is therefore an exercise in aligning storytelling, engineering and business planning. Small domes create multiple shareable moments and efficient revenue; mid-size domes deliver premium overnight experiences that drive higher ADRs and repeat visitors; large domes transform a site into a destination with diverse programming but require disciplined project execution.

Noticed a lot of people seem to prefer to turning off politics (in settings), however, meddling in foreign elections can be quite fun in the later stages of the game! Whether you are exploring M&A’s, cost-cutting options or just looking for something else to do, politics can be an exciting challenge to take on, especially, if you have an abundance of cash! 

Stage: Late Stage
Cash: NOI >$2 Billion (Annually)
Primary Targets: Cities with Anti-Trust & Gender Equality Laws 

                              -Mayor Elections-

Politics are centered on the Mayor Elections. Mayors will have a lean towards the: left (liberal), middle (moderate), and right (conservative) on the attributes below.  Based on the attribute spectrum, mayors will push the laws below to the assembly.

- Socialism vs Capitalism = Anti-Trust Laws
- Small vs Big Government = Taxes
- Environmentalism vs Economic Freedom = Green Laws
- Equality vs Traditional = Gender Equality Law

Mayor elections influence
-  The What?  - The laws or repeals are introduced to assembly
- The When? - The frequency of assembly elections 
- The How? - The laws that are enacted

If the mayors have a strong slate towards one side of the spectrum for all or most of the attributes, this will impact how frequently laws / repeals are introduced to the assembly. These are “activist” mayors that will start to introducing laws or repeals very quickly.  Generally, laws are favored to pass the assembly thru a majority vote. 

Occasionally, Mayors will refuse to sign or block a law and it’s sent back to the assembly for a rare supermajority poll. [I’ve seen a block overridden by a supermajority vote only once.] Usually, it’s a moderate mayor that will initially block a law or repeal. 

###Most importantly target Mayors = 
- Right-Wing
- Activist (strong slant on all attributes)
- Capitalist & Traditionalist 

[Quick note: Psyops don’t appear to work: I have not seen any evidence that competing coffee companies ever pay fines in the game - so I never advocate trying to install a left-wing mayor to sabotage another company into paying fines.]

                                -Terms / Cycles-

Mayor elections are cyclical. Most cities have elections every 4-years but others have 5 & 6 year terms.  A news update will appear 37-weeks from the election date (when polls close). The start / close dates & the terms (in years) are posted for every city below.

The election kick-off is your signal to start donating towards favorable candidates. Pay attention to the polls during those weeks and after donating.  

The game starts off with mayor elections in Chicago, Madrid & Seattle in 2023. The elections in 2030-2031 are the one of most important for politics in the game. Despite the varying terms (cycles), every city will have an election back to back during those years. By this time you should also have a good amount of cash to spend on these elections. 

###CITY (TERM)  🟢START DATE - 🏁POLL CLOSE

-                       BERLIN (5)	🟢01/08-🏁09/24
-                         ROME (5)	🟢01/22-🏁10/08

-            AMSTERDAM (6)	🟢11/19-🏁08/06

###Most importantly, target the: 
- Start Date (37-weeks from Election Date)
- 2030-2031 election seasons.

#-Donations-

Political donations can significantly influence the results of the elections. While amount is important, the frequency of donations is even more important. Donating $5 million weekly will result in better polls than $15 million every three weeks. You can donate multiple times to any candidate in increments of $5M. 

###Most importantly, target the donation: 
-  Frequency > Amount

#-Polls-

Incumbents are generally favored in most elections. I’ve noticed that moderates tend to face off against other moderates while activist will illicit activists from the other side of the spectrum. Though the entire process is pretty random, and polls are completely refreshed if the start date is repeated (save the week before the kick-off dates). 

If the preferred candidate is in first or second place according to the polls it’s usually best to only donate to the preferred candidate. If the preferred candidate is in third place, it’s best to still mostly donate to the preferred candidate with light donations to other candidates. 

This is where you can donate to a, low polling, left-wing mayor to pull more votes away from the top two candidates. This will decrease the poll numbers  for every candidate, but provide an opening for the third place person to jump ahead due to slimmer margins.  Once in second place, only donate to the preferred choice. 

If there is a >20% difference between the 1st & 2nd place candidate, according to the polls, it’s going to be extremely challenging to defeat the 1st place candidate. Conversely, if your preferred candidate has a 20% margin, you won’t have to donate much, if anything, to be successful. 

###Most importantly, polls show favorable mayor in:
- 1st or 2nd place = donate to preferred mayor only
- <=3rd place = donate to multiple candidates 

Polling margins =
- <5%  = Toss up
- 5% - 10% = Close 
- 10% - 20%= Comfortable
- >>20% = Safe

#-Assembly Elections-


This is usually the last chance to stop a law. Just like mayor elections, you can donate multiple times a week in increments of $5M. These law elections are random but will happen more frequently with an activist mayor. The voting results also typically favor the political leanings of the mayor. 

Once 51 votes are in it’s usually all but settled, but if a mayor blocks a law, the law is sent back for supermajority vote, which are not very successful. 

Just because a bill is voted down does not mean it goes away. There is a strong chance that the bill will be reintroduced to the assembly at some point so watch the news for political alerts. Usually, cities will work their way up towards the most damaging Anti-trust and Gender Equality laws but that’s not always true. 

###Most importantly:
- pay attention to the news especially when Anti-Trust or Gender Equality laws are mentioned. ",1,1755746138.0,CoffeeInc2,0,1.0,False

I 31M have been dating 27F for just over 9 months now. I'll be honest, from the first month, things have been both great and rocky. I'll go into some details. 

Firstly, we both are living in a different country from our original birthplace. I'm British, she is of Asian/Indian origin. Although, she admits to understanding her heritage, she does not practice many, if any customs her family may do at home. 

We met online after both of us being out of relationships for 4+ years (myself) and 2+ years (herself). We chatted extremely well, with our first date turning into a 2 week long meet up every day for walks, dinners, park hangouts, trip to a beach etc. After a while, I asked her if she'd like to continue dating and become more exclusive, which she was ecstatic about. We discussed all things regarding expectations, what we want from the relationship that we both dont want marriage, still on the discussion on whether we have kids or not to this day. 

However, after approx 1 month, I noticed things were becoming a little different between us. She seemed to be somewhat 'ramping up' the relationship in speed and intensity. We talked about this, to which she said that in her culture dating essentially means behaving like 'marriage' despite not wanted to be married for her. In her words - I know we don't want marriage but I expect you to treat me like a wife -.   
Which I totally understand and agree with... eventually. To me, this was one month or so into a relationship and for me, I'm still in the early dating stages of still learning, still understanding whether this person is for me. And I explained that to her. Which, she listened but still needed time to fully understand what I was meaning. 

Fast forward a few months, a few instances happened which I'll keep in short form:   
\- We went to my friends birthday party - she dressed so beautifully, stunning actually, however this was the first time meeting my friends (I know, group settings are scary also but we discussed over the previous weeks if she felt comfortable). And as a courteous mention only - I mentioned 'hey look, you look really beautiful, but this will be a casual beach hangout' - to which I meant, I'm worried for you feeling out of place. She later told me she felt disrespected and felt like I was telling her what to wear, which absolutely was not what I was aiming at. But I totally see how it could be interpreted as such.

\-Being at her friends party, she was feeling unwell but I didn't see/notice and she wasn't able to communicate well at the time. Expecting me to see that she wasn't well and find a reason for us to excuse ourselves. 

\- Talking a lot regarding trust issues. We have both been cheated on in the past, but it's really difficult for her to fully trust. Which does not help that a good portion of my friends are female, yet I do an activity (unfortunately won't disclose the sport for anonymity) in which even if I go alone, usually the girl friends of mine will also usually show up on their accordance too. As much reassurance and attempts to work on this, including asking if my gf would like to meet them with me individually for a coffee, or something easy. It just hasn't happened yet. The sport I can do can be quite dangerous with other people colliding with others so I'm always on a watch out - to which she interpreted as me 'watching' or checking out other girls. Again, I get it can be interpreted, but even with explaining the way I'm trying to take care of myself and sometimes my gf if she joins me with the sport, I'm just looking out for my wellbeing as well as hers when she joins. 

As well as despite all my best efforts with fluctuating capacities to reassure her and do my best to help her feel her worth in this relationship, she goes from commenting and praising how much love and care she has been feeling from me, the way I have improved from (mentioned problems in the past), yetshe still mentions she does not feel prioritised, goes quiet and retreats from me when she feels troubled. Which makes me feel I need to back off and give her some space to gather her thoughts as well as mine from time to time. I hate overstepping boundaries so this one is always tough for me. 

I have been doing a bit of relationship help reading. Semi-concluding but still diving into all things regarding us, that I'm more of an avoidant attachment style (secure when things are great, thriving even - but when things get real tough, the internal voices do get very loud), she's more anxious type. 

I'm seriously on the edge of calling this relationship off and truly believe that our compatibility with each other is challenged. Which is really hard for me to admit but honestly, my energy is depleting and I don't think I would be able to sustain this level fluctuation in a relationship. I understand all good relationships require work. But when it feels 'forced work' doesn't feel neutral or natural? 

Any advice given is appreciated.

1mvzmih,https://www.reddit.com/r/GCSE/comments/1mvzmih/thoughts_about_gcse_results_day/,Thoughts about GCSE results day,"it’s weird sitting here the night before results day, staring at my phone like it’s going to give me answers that aren’t coming until tomorrow. i’ve been trying to distract myself all day, scrolling through random youtube videos, going on tiktok for hours, but it’s like this heavy feeling in my chest just won’t shift. everything that happened over the last few months just keeps running on a loop in my head like a bad movie i can’t pause. i keep thinking about how different things felt back in may, when the exams started. i was stressed then, but at least i had her. she was the one person i thought would be by my side no matter what, the one i could text after an exam and just laugh about how badly we guessed the questions. now she’s gone. she walked out of my life like it was nothing, like two years of memories didn’t matter, and honestly it hurts so much more because it wasn’t even some big fight or betrayal. it was just her saying “we’ve grown apart” like that’s supposed to make it hurt less. if anything it makes me feel like i was never enough, like she was bored and just waited until now to tell me.

the thing is, this breakup didn’t just happen in a vacuum. it hit me at the worst possible time. i was already stressed about exams, about how i’d do, if i’d make the grades i need, and now it feels like the one thing keeping me grounded has been ripped away. everyone keeps saying “don’t worry, you’ll be fine,” but what does that even mean? no one actually knows how tomorrow is going to go. no one knows what’s in that envelope except the exam board, and honestly they feel like gods right now, holding my future in their hands while i sit here spiraling. i keep trying to imagine the moment i open it. like, what if it’s good news? what if i’ve smashed it? for a second that gives me a bit of hope. but then the other voice kicks in, the one that whispers “what if you failed, what if you didn’t even do enough to scrape by?” and that thought just eats me alive because i know how much i messed up some of those papers. english paper two? disaster. history source questions? might as well have written a love letter to the examiner because i definitely didn’t answer the actual question.

the envelopes themselves are fascinating, like why is it always cream paper? why not neon green so you can immediately tell someone’s died inside when they open it, or maybe holographic so the anxiety reflects in prisms across the school hall, and the printing font is always some bizarre compromise between comic sans and times new roman, enough to make your eyes twitch if you stare at it too long, the tiniest smudge on the paper can feel catastrophic, like if the ink is slightly uneven it’s a personal attack from the exam board itself, and then there’s the fold, always a mysterious fold halfway down, why is it folded that way, does it matter which way you open it, what if opening it the “wrong way” somehow changes your grade, these are the thoughts running through everyone’s head while silently plotting the fastest route to the bin outside if things go badly

siblings on results day are a whole ecosystem of chaos, older ones casually comparing their past grades like ancient war stories while younger ones lurk with fear in their eyes, some measuring themselves against the family average like an archaeological dig of past success, there’s always that one brother who insists on reminding you that he got eight 9s three years ago as if it’s somehow relevant to your physics paper and your younger sister smirking because she already predicted she’d beat your maths score before leaving the house, everyone’s quietly trying to memorise each other’s grade history while pretending it doesn’t matter, creating a bizarre mix of intimidation and weird statistical analysis as if results day is a sports draft combined with a stock market crash

the logistics of actually getting the results are chaotic in ways no one talks about, lines form like some dystopian amusement park queue, someone invariably drops an envelope in panic and it skitters under the radiator, a teacher bends down to retrieve it, and suddenly there’s a small crowd witnessing this mini-drama as if it’s theatre, lockers nearby are rattling from nervous tapping, some kids balance their envelopes on top of their phones for photos, others accidentally tear the top corner and panic slightly, calculations are running in everyone’s heads—what mark could equate to what grade if the boundaries shift by half a point, who made the higher tier mistakes, what about the controlled assessment from last term—there’s a mass spreadsheet of anxiety mentally being compiled in every head simultaneously, as if the hall itself has become a giant brain attempting to self-calculate every possible permutation of success and failure

snacks are an overlooked factor, someone always brings biscuits or crisps, there’s the quiet ritual of hiding chocolate in coat pockets, the tiny comfort of sugar as an emotional buffer for whatever the envelope contains, someone starts trading mini chocolate bars like currency because if you open a 4 in chemistry and your mate has a dairy milk, suddenly there’s negotiation, survival instincts kicking in, this micro-economy of sugar peaks at the exact moment someone yells “I got all nines” and the room’s attention shifts entirely, leaving the biscuits foraged and the quiet corners empty, teachers wandering through the crowd as bemused observers while students oscillate between celebration, panic, and chocolate barter

the hall’s acoustics make everything more dramatic, footsteps echo like drumbeats to a ritual, conversations blend into one long, continuous hum, every sigh is amplified, a dropped pen sounds like a thunderclap, laughter ricochets and combines with the shuffling of envelopes into an unintelligible symphony of impending adulthood measured in percentages and letters, if someone sneezes it’s considered a bad omen, if someone hums while opening an envelope it’s considered suspicious, the entire place vibrates with a weird mixture of anticipation, calculation, and a sense that every action is somehow symbolic, like a theatre production no one rehearsed for

teachers have this dual role, part celebratory, part quasi-judicial, they hover like referees in a bizarre match where everyone is playing different sports simultaneously, handing envelopes with a smile that does not match the tension in the room, nodding sagely at successes, patting shoulders of the “borderline cases,” murmuring encouragement that’s almost subliminal, like background noise in a video game where the player can’t quite interact with it but subconsciously absorbs meaning, they also serve as the sole source of factual verification if any envelope seems “wrong,” which naturally creates small pockets of frantic line splitting, whispered discussions about rechecks, and the occasional audacious claim of “this isn’t mine” that sparks minor social upheaval

exam boards, while invisible, are omnipresent in everyone’s imagination, imagined as enormous, windowless towers where people in robes debate boundaries with abacuses, slowly adjusting the world’s fate one mark at a time, the entire proceedings feel like a combination of mythology and bureaucracy, some students theorise that the papers themselves are alive, subtly influencing answers depending on stress levels, lighting conditions, and which pen you used, conspiracy theories thrive in this environment, some genuinely complex, some so absurd they make sense in the fever dream of results day, everyone sharing half-formed theories about mark inflation, tier manipulation, and secret teacher alliances while quietly accepting that the envelope is the only true judge

past siblings’ results loom like historical artifacts, family walls lined metaphorically with framed A*s and C grades, younger generations must navigate this archive, internalising legends of heroic exam feats, mundane successes, and catastrophic failures, creating a mental scoring system that predetermines expectations before the envelope is even touched, some consciously rebel by hoping for mediocrity, others overcompensate, attempting to predict mark boundaries down to decimal points, while old tales are retold with variations, each retelling slightly more dramatic than the last, so by the time results day actually arrives, a layered, intergenerational narrative exists in parallel with the physical envelope in your hand

and it’s not just about the grades, you know? it’s about what they mean. everyone acts like they’re just letters on a page, but they’re not. they’re the difference between moving on with your friends or being stuck retaking while everyone else moves forward. they’re the difference between feeling like you achieved something and feeling like a failure before you’ve even started your life. i keep imagining all the conversations i’ll have to have if it goes wrong. my parents trying to be supportive but secretly disappointed, teachers giving me that “you could have done better” look, my mates asking how i did while i try not to cry in a corner. it’s brutal because these grades feel like they define you for the rest of your life, even though everyone says they don’t.

and then there’s her. god, i hate that she’s still in my head when i should be focusing on myself. every time i think about tomorrow, i imagine her being there, laughing with her friends, maybe even posting a picture holding her results like nothing ever happened between us. and i know that shouldn’t bother me because we’re done, but it does. it makes me feel like i lost twice: lost the girl and now maybe about to lose my future. i wanted to text her today, just to say good luck, but what’s the point? she probably doesn’t even care how i do. she’s probably already moved on.

this summer was supposed to be different. i had all these plans in my head, things i wanted to do, places i wanted to go, just making memories before everything changes next year. instead i spent most of it overthinking, scrolling through old pictures, wondering where it all went wrong. my mates tried to cheer me up, dragged me out a few times, but it’s like i wasn’t even there. i was physically present but mentally stuck in some loop where i keep replaying old conversations with her and imagining different outcomes, like if i’d just said one thing differently maybe she’d still be here. it’s pathetic, i know, but heartbreak makes you think like that.

and now here i am, the night before everything. it feels like the whole year has been building up to this one day, this one envelope. it’s not even about the exams anymore; it’s about proving to myself that all the stress, the late nights, the breakdowns were worth it. and yet, i can’t stop thinking about how tomorrow could break me. like, what if i walk into that hall, pick up my results, and my heart just sinks? i keep picturing the scene in my head: rows of people opening envelopes, some screaming with happiness, some crying, everyone comparing grades like their worth depends on it. i hate that i care so much, but i do. because i’ve tied so much of my self-worth to this moment.

anyway, so now i’m thinking about revision again because honestly it’s traumatic. like, who decided that past papers were the holy grail of revision? every teacher acts like they’re the ultimate solution. “just do past papers and you’ll be fine.” no karen, doing 40 questions i don’t understand is not fine, it’s psychological warfare. and you know what’s even worse? the mark schemes. oh my god, the mark schemes are like written by someone who hates teenagers. you write a full paragraph explaining something in perfect detail and the mark scheme’s like “did not use the word ‘significantly.’ 0 marks.” but then if you write one random word that matches theirs, suddenly you’re a genius. sometimes i wonder if examiners even read answers or if they just throw darts at a wall and decide your grade based on that.

and while we’re on the topic, why are examiners always anonymous? like, who are these mysterious beings judging us? i bet they’re sitting in some dimly lit room with a cup of tea, ruining my life one tick at a time. what if they’re in a bad mood that day? like what if their cat knocked over their coffee and now they’re taking it out on my essay about shakespeare. i bet some of them get a power trip. imagine being able to control someone’s entire summer with a red pen. it’s insane.

but revision itself is just… a fever dream. everyone says make a timetable. okay, cool, i make a timetable, i colour-code it, i add stickers, it looks like something you’d find on pinterest. then i follow it for one day and after that it’s just chaos. day two: “oops didn’t do maths because i was tired.” day three: “didn’t do anything because netflix released a new show.” by the end of the week the timetable is basically a piece of abstract art pinned to the wall while i spiral. and then there’s that moment where you’re sitting in your room, staring at your notes, and suddenly you’re like “what if i just… didn’t.” what if i just accepted failure and became a goat farmer in the mountains or something. sounds peaceful honestly.

and don’t even get me started on those motivational revision quotes. “believe in yourself.” okay sure but belief doesn’t get me marks on the quadratic formula, does it? “pain is temporary, grades are forever.” wrong again, karen. grades might be forever on paper but so is the trauma of gcse maths question 17. you know what else annoyed me? those “study with me” videos on youtube. like you watch them thinking it’ll motivate you, but instead you’re just staring at someone with perfect handwriting sipping aesthetic coffee while you’re in your dressing gown surrounded by biscuit crumbs and existential dread.

now, let’s talk about exam day itself because that’s its own level of psychological torture. waking up at 6am, feeling like you’re going to war. the silence in the hall before the paper starts is actually horrifying. like, you can hear every single cough, every footstep, every person clicking their pen like their life depends on it. and then the invigilator says “you may begin” and suddenly it’s game over. and why do they always read the instructions like we can’t read? “write in black ink.” oh wow, thank you for reminding me after the 47 times you told us before. and then there’s that kid who always asks the dumbest question. “can we use a pen?” no dave, use a quill and ink like it’s 1402.

the worst thing is that moment when you turn the page and see a question you don’t understand. like, you studied everything except THAT one thing. the sheer betrayal you feel in that moment is indescribable. and then you look around like the answers might be floating in the air somewhere. nope, just sarah scribbling away like she’s writing a novel while you’re contemplating your life choices.

also, let’s talk about how exams make you question your sanity. like, halfway through a paper you start convincing yourself the most basic things are wrong. “is 7 + 5 actually 12? wait, is it? what if it’s 13? what if i’ve been living a lie?” and then your brain decides to remind you of every embarrassing thing you’ve ever done instead of focusing on the actual question. like yeah thanks brain, really helpful, let’s think about that time in year 7 when i fell off my chair instead of calculating the area of a trapezium.

and then when it’s over, the post-exam analysis starts. oh my god, the absolute hell of people outside the hall. “what did you get for question 6?” i don’t know, trauma probably. and then someone says an answer completely different to yours and you’re like great, guess i failed. and then you go on twitter and see memes about how bad the paper was, and for a brief moment you feel united with thousands of strangers in shared suffering.

now summer after exams is such a weird limbo. you go from being constantly stressed to suddenly having nothing to do, and your brain doesn’t know how to cope. so you just sit there overthinking results day for two months straight. every night it’s like “what if i failed everything” and then the next night “but what if i actually did okay.” and then there’s those nightmares where you open your results and it just says “lol” in big letters. and every time someone asks “so how do you think you did?” you have to do that awkward laugh and say “oh, you know, okay i guess” when really you’re dying inside.

and now, here we are. the night before. the night that feels longer than the entire exam season combined. it’s like time slows down just to mess with you. i’ve cleaned my room, scrolled through every social media app, stared at the ceiling for an hour, and still it’s only 10pm. and then you start thinking about all the random stuff you should’ve done differently. “why didn’t i revise earlier? why did i spend three hours making a colour-coded timetable instead of actually working? why did i spend the entire french listening exam wondering what i was going to have for lunch?” but it’s too late now. tomorrow is the final boss fight. and i’m not ready.

and then you start thinking about siblings because that’s a whole other layer of stress. like my older brother did his results ages ago and apparently smashed it, so now there’s this unspoken family scoreboard where i’m just expected to “do as well as he did” which is ridiculous because he’s basically a robot when it comes to exams. like he was the type who made revision timetables and actually stuck to them. imagine that level of discipline. he’d wake up at 6am, revise for 8 hours, take a 30-minute break to drink water and stare at a wall, then go back to revision. meanwhile i’m sitting there at 3pm eating doritos and wondering if writing one page of notes counts as a productive day. and the worst part? he’ll be there tomorrow, just casually watching me pick up my envelope like some smug overlord. he’ll probably say something like “don’t worry, it’s not that bad” while knowing full well he got a clean sweep of 9s.

and then there’s the younger sibling dynamic. like if you’ve got a little brother or sister, they’re watching this whole thing go down like it’s a netflix drama. they’re probably thinking “wow, gcses look intense” while also planning how they’re going to lord it over you if you mess up. because you know if you fail, that’s the family story forever. like christmas dinner 2037 and someone will go “remember when you opened that envelope and just walked out silently.” it’ll become folklore.

and the parents… oh my god the parents. why do they act like results day is the olympics? like they’re there refreshing the group chat with every aunt and uncle ready to post my grades like it’s breaking news. “he got a 7 in maths” okay linda calm down, it’s not a nobel prize. and the car ride home is going to be so awkward regardless of what happens. if you do well, they’ll say “see, all that stress wasn’t necessary” as if they didn’t spend the last 6 months breathing down your neck. and if you don’t do well, it’s all “well, did you try your best?” and you’re just sitting there thinking about the 400 hours you spent pretending to revise while watching minecraft videos on youtube.

also why does every school insist on making results day a social event? like just give me the grades in an email and let me process in peace. but no, we have to all gather in the hall, smiling awkwardly, pretending we’re not seconds away from a breakdown. and they always put this weird spread of biscuits and squash like that’s going to make it better. like thanks for the custard cream, mr smith, but i think i’ve just ruined my entire academic career so maybe i’ll skip the orange squash. and then the teachers hover like vultures, trying to see your grades without actually asking. “so… how do you think you did?” what do you mean how do i THINK i did? i’m literally about to find out in 30 seconds, diane. calm down.

oh and there’s always that one kid whose parents bring a full entourage. like the entire extended family, three cameras, maybe a cake with “congratulations” written on it even though they haven’t opened the envelope yet. imagine the audacity. and then if they fail? that’s a family funeral right there. and speaking of audacity, you know what’s wild? the people who open their results live on instagram or tiktok. like who wants that level of pressure? if my results were being streamed to the internet i’d just spontaneously combust.

and let’s talk about grade boundaries again because honestly they deserve their own netflix documentary. like why are they so unpredictable? last year a 72% was a 9, this year it’s probably going to be like 85% because apparently everyone became an academic weapon overnight. and then you’ve got the conspiracy theorists in the group chat like “nah they’ll be low this year because the papers were hard” and then the grade boundaries drop and suddenly a 3 is 98 marks. who’s making these decisions? is there a secret exam board council sitting in a dark room spinning a wheel like “biology paper? yeah, let’s ruin some lives.”

and why does everyone forget about the actual process of picking up results? like no one talks about the fact you have to queue behind 40 other sweaty teenagers while your soul slowly leaves your body. and you know the person giving out envelopes has definitely peeked inside and knows exactly whether you’re about to cry or not. i swear some of them give you that look. like that pity smile that says “oh sweetheart, brace yourself.” and then you’ve got people opening envelopes in the middle of the hall like they’re main characters while i’m planning to find a dark corner or maybe a different postcode before i look.

and then, the comparison game begins. the absolute hellscape of people loudly announcing their grades like they’re reading lottery numbers. “i got four 9s and three 8s” okay sophie, congratulations, now please lower your voice before i evaporate. and then they ask YOU what you got, and you have to decide whether to tell the truth, lie, or fake a phone call and run away. and the group chats? oh my god, the group chats turn into academic hunger games. people posting screenshots of their results with captions like “omg didn’t expect this!!” even though you know they revised for 400 hours and made colour-coded spreadsheets.

and the thing is, even if you do well, it never ends. because then the next question is “what are you doing for sixth form?” like can we not? can i just exist for one day without planning the next three years of my life? and then the conversations about what subjects you’re taking start, and you realise you’ve committed to studying chemistry for two years even though you cried during the gcse paper.

also, quick side note: why do exam boards make papers that look like they’ve been photocopied by a raccoon? like the diagrams are always slightly tilted, the text looks like it’s been printed in 1997, and sometimes there’s random black dots on the page like “spot the existential crisis.” and the wording of the questions… who writes these? “explain the significance of context in relation to interpretation.” okay jason, maybe use human words? and then you have those questions that are like “describe the structure of dna” and you’re like cool, easy, and then the next part is “now write a love letter from the perspective of a mitochondrion.”

and let’s not forget those practice exams schools make you do in december. the ones where they say “it’s just to see where you’re at” and then suddenly the results are being displayed on a graph in assembly while you sit there dying inside because apparently your 24% in physics is now public knowledge. and then teachers start doing that thing where they say “don’t worry, these aren’t your real grades” but then also add “if you don’t improve, you’ll fail your actual exams” like thanks for the mixed messaging, really helpful.

and then there’s the outfits for results day, like when did that become a thing? why is everyone suddenly turning up like it’s the met gala? it’s literally a school hall full of envelopes and biscuits but no, apparently you need to dress like you’re about to shoot a fashion editorial because if you don’t, you risk being immortalised in 87 instagram stories looking like you’ve been living under a rock for the entire summer which honestly, you have, because revision did that to us all so now there’s this weird pressure where you have to pick the right balance between casual and “i didn’t try but i still look like i belong on a magazine cover” so you end up in jeans and a hoodie hoping no one notices the existential panic in your eyes

i'm that nih🎵, i'm that nih🎵, i'm that nih🎵, i'm that nih🎵, i'm that nih🎵, i'm that nih🎵, i'm that nih🎵, i'm that nih🎵, 

and what is it with the people who bring bags for their results? like what are you carrying, the entire exam board? you need a bag for one envelope? but then again maybe they’re bringing snacks because the queue is like 400 years long so honestly fair play and speaking of the queue why does it feel like being in line for the worst rollercoaster ever, everyone’s making awkward small talk like “what did you do over summer” as if any of us actually did anything besides scroll through grade boundary predictions and cry into our pillows for two months and then there’s always that one teacher at the front smiling like this is a happy occasion when actually it’s just collective anxiety in a gym that smells like floor polish and trauma

and you know what’s weird about results day? the fact that everyone knows who got what within 10 minutes, like it’s meant to be private but somehow the entire school knows that sarah got nine 9s and dan from maths somehow got a 3 even though he was predicted a 7 and no one knows how this information spreads so fast like are there spies in the hall, does the school hire secret agents to leak this stuff because the gossip network on results day is more efficient than the postal service and then suddenly the group chats are on fire with screenshots and blurry photos of envelopes like we’re all part of some underground black market of grades

and while we’re at it why do parents treat results day like a competitive sport, you’ll have karen from down the road posting “so proud of my amazing daughter, 7 grade 9s and 2 8s” within 0.2 seconds of leaving the school like congratulations karen, your kid can memorise stuff, want a medal? and then your own parents see that post and suddenly it’s all “well sophie next door did really well” as if i needed more pressure and don’t even get me started on the family group chat, everyone’s waiting for the update like it’s the season finale of a tv show, your gran sending 12 good luck emojis at 7am like calm down margaret i haven’t even brushed my teeth yet and you know they’ll all be asking for screenshots the second you get home like it’s some kind of national announcement

and then there’s that one kid who says “i didn’t even revise” and then casually pulls out a string of 9s like they’re the chosen one, like congratulations jessica you’re a genius and a liar because we all know you had those fancy gel pens and revision cards with quotes in gold ink or whatever meanwhile i was out here trying to remember if osmosis is diffusion or diffusion is osmosis because honestly at this point it’s all just water moving somewhere

also can we talk about the teachers on results day, why do they suddenly turn into motivational speakers like you pick up your envelope and they’re like “remember, grades don’t define you” and i’m standing there like okay cool but you spent the last two years saying if i didn’t get a 6 i’d be homeless so which is it diane and then they always do that “well done, we’re proud of you no matter what” thing which sounds sweet until you realise they probably said that to everyone including the kid who wrote their name and drew a smiley face on the science paper

also exam boards, oh my god, they’re like the illuminati, no one really knows what happens after you put your paper in the pile, like where do they even go, do they get shipped to a cave somewhere where examiners in robes chant around them deciding your fate and who actually makes the grade boundaries, is there a big red button someone presses like “yes, maths boundaries will destroy lives this year” because honestly that seems likely and while we’re on the subject why do they never release those memes everyone makes about the papers because you know the examiners must see them like imagine marking 400 papers about shakespeare and then logging into twitter to see “romeo had rizz” trending

and speaking of english why were the literature papers always so random like they’ll tell you to revise 300 poems and then ask you about the one poem no one has seen since 1963 and the question will be something like “explore how the poet presents feelings about plums” and you’re just sitting there like wow okay guess i’ll write three paragraphs about sadness and fruit and hope for the best and don’t even get me started on unseen poetry, the biggest scam of the entire education system, like here’s a poem you’ve never read, now write a 25-mark essay about it in 20 minutes as if i’m some kind of psychic literary analyst

and the science papers weren’t any better, one minute it’s “explain photosynthesis” and you’re like cool got this and the next it’s “a llama is running on a treadmill, calculate the force of its dreams divided by the gravitational pull of saturn” like sorry what, who’s writing these questions and why are they obsessed with llamas, rabbits, or some other random animal living its best life on a physics paper

oh and the night before results day hits different, like suddenly everyone becomes an expert statistician, scrolling through forums at 3am reading “grade boundary predictions” like they’re stock market graphs and then you see someone say “boundaries will be the highest they’ve ever been” and your soul just leaves your body and then another person says “nah they’ll be lower because of how hard the papers were” and now you don’t know what to believe and then you start calculating how many marks you THINK you got on each question even though you know full well your brain made up half those answers during the exam and somehow you convince yourself you either got straight 9s or straight 3s, no in-between

and speaking of predictions, why do teachers always predict either too high or too low, like they’ll tell you “yeah you’re definitely a 7” and then you open your results and it’s a 4 or they’ll say “hmm you might get a 4 if you’re lucky” and then you magically get an 8 and then they act surprised like wow you really pulled it out the bag as if they didn’t make you feel like a failure for six months straight

also, the group chats the night before results day are unhinged, everyone sending memes about crying in the school toilets, people making jokes like “haha imagine if we all failed” which is funny until it happens and then no one’s laughing and then at 8am it’s just pure chaos, 200 unread messages of people saying “good luck!!” and posting screenshots of themselves in the car like they’re on the way to a festival instead of a government-mandated anxiety ceremony

and then let’s not forget the people who open their envelope and immediately start calculating their average grade like calm down we’re not in an excel spreadsheet competition and then there’s always that one person who brings a calculator to check their combined science score and you just know they’re the type who did the higher tier paper for fun
so anyway i’m sitting here thinking about results and suddenly i’m like why do we even do gcses? like genuinely who invented this? some victorian guy probably, sitting there in his powdered wig (or was that even victorian? i don’t know history and ironically i sat a history exam so that’s worrying) just deciding “hey let’s make teenagers write 40 essays in 2 weeks and memorise the exact date of some random war no one cares about anymore.” like why does it matter that i know what happened in 1066? congratulations, normans invaded, and now i’m stressing in 2025 because of it. and the way they tell you “it prepares you for life” but in what world is someone going to stop me on the street and go “quick, name five features of an oxbow lake or you lose your job.” i swear half the geography paper was just me guessing and hoping for the best. river erosion diagrams? i just drew squiggly lines and prayed the examiner was feeling generous.

and don’t even get me started on maths. oh my god. i hate how maths papers trick you. they start all friendly, like “what is 5 + 3” and you’re like wow i’ve got this, easy marks, maybe i’m actually good at this. and then question 6 hits you with “a farmer has 200 sheep and half of them decide to go on strike because of a quadratic inequality, calculate the volume of his existential dread” and suddenly you’re sweating and writing down random numbers hoping one of them is worth a method mark. and the invigilators just walking up and down like prison guards, shoes clicking on the floor like some psychological torture soundtrack. why do they always have that expression? like half-smiling, half “if you sneeze i will end you.” and then you look up at the clock and 45 minutes have passed and you’ve written your name and drawn a triangle for moral support.

but honestly the worst part of exams wasn’t even the exams. it was the revision. the constant “you should be revising” every time you breathe. like you pick up your phone for one second and suddenly your mum appears out of nowhere like some kind of revision dementor. “shouldn’t you be revising?” yes karen i should but i’ve been staring at a chemistry textbook for four hours and now i’m trying to remember how to be human. and don’t even get me started on the guilt scrolling. like you go on tiktok and suddenly it’s just endless people doing “my 12 hour productive study day” and you’re sitting there in your dressing gown eating crisps at 2pm like wow maybe i am the problem. and the worst bit is you try to make revision interesting. you make those cute flashcards, colour-coded notes, highlight everything in five different colours, and then you realise you’ve spent three hours making a title page that says “physics” and know nothing about actual physics. and then there’s that one subject that you never revise for because you convince yourself “it’ll be fine” and then the exam starts and you’re like wow i have never seen these words before in my life.

and now it’s all over. months of stress, energy drinks, crying into your pillow at 1am, and for what? for one piece of paper you collect in a sweaty school hall while teachers hover like vultures. and why is results day always in the morning? like yeah let’s all get up at 6am so we can go and publicly destroy our self-esteem before breakfast. and you know what else annoys me? the people who say “don’t stress, gcses don’t matter.” okay becky, easy for you to say when you’re already working at your dad’s company or whatever, but for the rest of us who need these grades for sixth form, they kind of do matter. it’s like telling someone standing on the edge of a cliff “don’t look down.” yeah thanks genius, really helpful.

also what is the deal with the grade boundaries? they’re like mythical creatures. everyone spends the whole summer guessing what they’ll be. “oh this year they’ll be low because the paper was hard.” no, this year they’ll be high because everyone suddenly became albert einstein overnight apparently. and then you finally see them and you’re like how is 70% an 8? in what universe is that fair? like i got 54 marks on that physics paper and that could be anything from a 4 to a 7 depending on the mood of the exam board. and then there’s always that one person who’s like “i didn’t even revise” and walks away with all 9s and you’re just standing there holding your grade 5 in maths like cool, i memorised the entire textbook for this.

and let’s talk about the school hall. why does it smell so weird on results day? like a mix of sweat, floor cleaner, and pure fear. and they always make you queue up like you’re at some kind of theme park but the ride is just emotional devastation. and everyone’s doing that fake casual thing, like “oh yeah i’m chill, not even worried” while secretly praying to every deity they can think of. and then you get the envelope and your hands are shaking and your brain is like “open it now” and also “don’t open it ever” at the same time. and when you finally rip it open, there’s that half-second where your eyes see the letters but your brain doesn’t process them yet, and you’re like am i a genius or do i need to move to another country immediately.

and then you look around and there’s people crying happy tears, people crying sad tears, people posting on instagram already like “so proud” with those annoying sparkly emojis. and you’re just there thinking about how you’ve spent the entire summer imagining this moment and now it’s just… done. all that stress, all that build-up, and it’s over in five seconds. then what? everyone just goes to mcdonald’s apparently. like congratulations on your life-defining grades, now here’s a soggy big mac.",6,1755745555.0,GCSE,7,1.0,False

I got married and moved to a very small town 6 months ago for my husband’s job. Honestly? I hate it here and I haven’t been able to find a job to hire me because my Korean isn’t the best. I’ve been applying to remote jobs, coffee shops, anything you can think of and I’ve had no luck. While teaching English I taught myself marketing and graphic design skills to hopefully switch careers cause I wanted to go to something with more progression than teaching English. I’ve had a few interviews with marketing agencies or beauty brands and things go well until they ask where I live and realize I can’t commute every day to Seoul. 

Recently, I had the lucky opportunity to get two offers from two completely different careers: the one I’m hoping to get into and the one I was hoping to leave. You might wonder why I’m asking for advice but hear me out because they both have pros and cons. 

Social media marketing job:
-It’s the career I want to enter 
-I’d have creativity to post for the small business however I want 
-It’s in Seoul (2 hours away) and I’d have to commute twice a week which would cost about $20 a day 
-There’s a one month trial period and if she doesn’t like my work, I’m out. 

Teaching job: 
-Stable income with more pay than the other job (about $1000 more)
-near my house so I don’t have to worry about commuting 
-I wanted to leave this profession in the first place bc it has no real growth 
-I fear getting depressed and settling into this job then quitting my marketing career dreams 

They both have 6 hours a day of work so I can work around my schedule to make my own personal content and do anything else I want on my own time. 

But what do I do?! It feels like a pivotal moment in my life and I’m freaking out so please anyone help…

1mvz4tv,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mvz4tv/the_scarlet_letter_entry_5_burlington_to_eden/,The Scarlet Letter (Entry 5: Burlington To Eden),"I got up and proceeded to get ready like I do every morning: brush my teeth, shave my face of any facial hair, shower, get dressed, and mentally make a checklist of things that need to be done. Today’s list was fairly simple: get gas for the car, maybe get coffee in preparation for a long day, then take the one-hour drive to Eden.

After I was done showering, I was surprised to find Leah standing in the bathroom waiting for me.

“Yes? Can I help you?”

“I’m going with you.”

She looked determined and ready for an argument, but I was unwilling and unable to think of a reason not to take her—beyond the obvious corpse that was awaiting me in the backyard of my childhood home.

“Yeah, sure. I could use the company, honestly.”

“Oh… I think I was expecting more of a fight.”

“Oh, for sure, normally I probably would’ve. But I think I shouldn’t be alone.”

Her demeanor changed. The usually soft, pretty, and somewhat awkward Leah I knew had turned into someone determined and confident—a side of her I don’t think I had ever known.

“I made coffee and got you breakfast. Clothes are on the bed, and the car is packed and good to go.”

“Geez, did you leave anything for me to do?”

She started to open the door and walked out before looking back. In a weird tone of voice—almost menacing and off-putting—she added:

“Let’s just get this over with so we can go back home.”

Who pissed in her cereal bowl? Maybe she’s mad I manipulated her to come here? Fuck her, stupid bitch. It’s my own fault. I made her this way, and I think she might be cynical because of how I’ve been using her to fill a void within myself. She’ll learn to move on from me. I hope.

⸻

I dried myself off with a towel and felt my ribs again, this time looking in the mirror. Yeah, they’re absolutely broken. What kind of dream makes things happen in real life? I don’t have time for this—I just want to get it over with.

I went into the bedroom and saw the clothes she had laid out for me: light green summer shorts, a white undershirt, and a button-up shirt with a floral design. Guess we are going light-colored today. Leah has a better sense of style than I could ever hope to have.

If I had my way, I’d wear black slacks and a white dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up to my elbows every day. I’m simple. I like that. But she does know how to make me look good. The shirt was a little tight, but it showed off my physique, which was a plus. On top of that, it was pretty light and allowed me to move around easily.

Grabbing my keys, I left the apartment, looking around one more time in case anything was left behind—either on purpose or by accident.

⸻

Leah was already waiting in my car. She sat in the passenger seat with her legs up on the dash, the convertible top down and the light hitting her perfectly. Just looking at her smooth, lightly sun-kissed legs made me aroused.

She sat there in her daisy dukes and a white button-up cut-off shirt, wearing a raffia sun hat and sunglasses to keep the sun from her face. Her bare feet had black nail polish on the toes.

The only imperfections were the things I could relate to the most about her. On her inner thigh lay several deep, dark purple marks leading up toward her pelvis. I had counted them before, when we lay naked together at my apartment. Twenty-four in total.

I couldn’t help but stare at her from the door, like I was a voyeur peering through a window, catching a glimpse of something I shouldn’t. The view looked straight out of one of those cheesy-ass rom-coms I disdain.

Maybe I don’t want her to move on. Maybe I want her more than I realize. I don’t have the time for this.

⸻

I walked toward the car and looked in to make sure everything was there. Before I could even open the door, a bag of pills was thrown at me.

“I got those for you before I left. Don’t say I don’t do anything for you. You need to quit before you kill yourself.”

I wanted to say something awful back, but something held me back. Probably the way she looked. I couldn’t help but be nice in return.

“I know. Thank you.”

“Don’t mention it. And if anyone at work asks, you got those on your own.”

I sifted through the baggie to find Xanax, Ritalin, Percs, Vicodin, and better yet, fentanyl. She would be fired and immediately arrested if she got caught stealing these. I couldn’t help but smile before taking one of the Percs and letting it melt on my tongue, then taking a sip from my water bottle to wash it down.

I sat in the driver’s seat and waited for the wave to crash into me. I loved the feeling of being high. It was the only way I felt alive anymore.

She looked at me and smacked her teeth in disgust.

“Don’t fucking kill me, okay?”

“I know what I’m doing. Just keep looking beautiful.”

“Yeah, whatever, man. Let’s just get going.”

I could tell that she was growing more and more impatient with me—almost like she hated me now, and probably rightfully so. I didn’t care. I just wanted to have whatever discussion she wanted so I could bend her over and fuck her on my kitchen table.

⸻

I started the car, and to my surprise the gas tank was full.

“You’re welcome,” I heard from the passenger side.

“How much?”

“Consider it a condolence gift for the funeral.”

I shrugged and didn’t want to fight, so I turned the wheel and we headed off.

Summer in Vermont is beautiful. The trees are back to life, and the countryside is vibrant and colorful as ever. The air smells fresh and clean, away from the cities. Hell, even Burlington has a beautiful sight and smell to it.

We—and by “we” I mean I—decided to take the scenic route. It would’ve been the same distance and time as the highway, so fuck it. Why not, yeah? I’m sure Leah has never been here because she’s a big-city girl. From Miami, to be exact.

I have a paper copy of her license. I may have also gone through her wallet for the occasional twenty-dollar bill every once in a while. I never said I was a saint….

⸻

“Hey, so I think we could have that talk now.”

Really? Now of all times? Alright, let’s see how this goes…

“Okay, sure. What’s on your mind?”

Leah twirled a strand of her silky, vibrant black hair between her fingers as a way to alleviate the obvious stress and discomfort on her mind.

“Look, we’ve had fun. Lots of fun, even. I’m not getting any younger, though, and I want something real.”

Great. Just my luck. The whole “I’m almost thirty and I need to think about the future” talk. Leah turned to me, her legs swiping off the dashboard.

“I want you. Badly. And I need to know you feel the same. But I want it to be exclusive, and if you can’t do that then let’s call a spade a spade. Right here, right now.”

The guilt burning inside of me told me to call it off and do the right thing. Even if I said yes, there was no promise of this being anything other than me getting my dick wet. However, that’s not what left my mouth. It shocked me a little when I told her:

“I haven’t felt this way about anyone before. I think I love you.”

She sat there, her mouth gaped open. What had I just done? My mind was racing, and it was as if I had crashed the car and time stood still. Like I had slipped into a coma and was the only one able to move.

“You do?”

She broke the silence. I saw her face turn from a lovely hue of pink to a red shade of embarrassment.

“I have always loved you, Leah. I wouldn’t have asked you up here if I didn’t.”

What the fuck is going on? Stop talking, you dumbass.

“I guess then I don’t have to talk much more. I’m sorry I doubted you.”

Leah looked almost completely satisfied. I could tell that I had just done something absolutely disgusting and betrayed any chance of trust I may have had with her. Her legs went right back onto the dashboard, and she started humming. She smiled with a sincere look of content, and I swore that she looked as if she was glowing.

⸻

My mind raced with what I had just done. I felt betrayed by even myself. We must’ve talked the entire way up, because I don’t even know what happened to that hour of driving. Leah pointed out all the animals along the way, the open mountain ranges, the hillside farms, the general stores, and the old beat-to-shit trucks that were parked in their lots.

It was cute, to be fair, and she genuinely loved everything about the drive. I could tell that if she just took me seriously like I think she did about love…

I’m moving back home.

Do you want to have A family around, just not Your family? Our two-parent, two-teen household is spilling into a second apartment in our building. There's a guest room we'll use, an open bedroom (that's you), lots of shared space, and a little washer and dryer.

Foot traffic: None of us are your full-time roommate, but your room is in our home, and all 4 of us will be in and out, working from the guest room, doing laundry, etc. Sometimes one of us will sleep over for a weekend. Sometimes a kid will hang around watching youtube (with earbuds). This is a bedroom in a family home, but none of us currently sleep there full-time, so you would be the main person with shampoo in the shower. We are not a party crew, and we are glad to keep quiet as a default setting. 

The room: The room is 12 by 15 feet, 180sf, though some of that is taken up by a six-foot wide, 30-inch deep closet that goes up to the 9-foot ceiling. That leaves 165 sf of open floor. There are two sunny west/southwest facing windows. They look out on multi-lane traffic, although it's 60+ feet away, plus a lot of trees and sky. Unfurnished. We can take you to ikea if you want to pick stuff out. The wood floors are nice, but a building rule requires rugs over 80% of them to reduce noise.

Shared spaces: The living room, kitchen, and bath are shared. There isn’t a tv in the living room, or shelving, or decor, and for us that’s good, that's minimalism. We'll be in and out of the bathroom and kitchen. We’ll store stuff in the kitchen and cook there sometimes, but it’s not our 12-meals-a-day cooking environment.

Utilities: We just put in a new bedroom window a/c. In heat season you will more likely be too warm than too cold—steam radiators. Half of gas, electric, and wifi is about 75/month. Maybe higher now that there's a/c?

Building: The building is a family-oriented walkup coop, fairly diverse, and lgbt friendly. There are multiple outdoor spaces, including front yard and courtyard, plus a long, skinny back courtyard (or is it an alley?) where people do some veg gardening. Take a raised bed, there are extra ones. The front yard is mostly decorative, but the courtyard is comfortable. There’s a bigger laundry room in the basement. And just to repeat the word walkup again, it’s a walkup. Building quiet hours are 10pm to 9am, and we have to take them seriously because the super lives directly below us.

Neighborhood: You can walk around the block and hit laundromats, delis, coffee, and basic takeout without crossing the street. More coffee, some bars, and a bookstore within a few blocks. Bigger grocery stores and more serious restaurants 5-10 minutes walk. Ten minutes in either direction to Greenwood Cemetery or Prospect Park.

Transit: We are 0.3 miles to either the Fort Hamilton F/G (the directions say 8-minute walk ) or Church Ave F/G (9 minutes). The B and D are farther, 0.7 miles (16 minutes), but the bus can often get to them faster than that. There are also express buses to lower Manhattan that get on the highway after our block and go nonstop. There are two Citibike racks within a block. 

About us: Nerds for sure. Our current employers include: a bookstore, a publisher, a parenting group. The kids are pretty mild for teenagers. So far.

About you: We enjoy students and artists, and we plan to enjoy meeting you, whoever you are. We'll have to collaborate on cleaning—are you ok to collaborate on cleaning? And you'd have to live with our varied schedules and with kids. You ok with kids?

Long-range stayability: If you were happy here and wanted to stay, it’s possible to get past the building’s two-year sublet limit. If any one of our hosting family eventually lived full-time in the guest room, then you could legally switch from a ""sublet"" to a longer-term ""roommate.""

Photo footnote: Please disregard the construction dust. Also the bathroom isn't bad at all, just not photogenic right now.

Possibles and impossibles: Couples, impossible. Loudness or hosting hookups or parties, also impossible. Small, lovely neutered dogs maybe possible? Cats, impossible (allergies). Basement bike storage possible. Smoking, impossible.

How-to: Because we’re a family and because it’s a coop building, this takes more oomph than an average shared rental.

Steps:  1. Come see if it’s any kind of match. 2. If so, meet the kids. Facetime or zoom is fine for that. 3. If that works, we'll send you the application form. 4. Enter the paperwork tunnel: Do you have two school or work-related recommendation letters? Great, PDF them. If not, have a boss and/or family friend write some. Filed taxes? Great, attach the top page. Ditto bank statements. Ditto pay stubs. 5. Send it all back and the board will approve it. (We're on the board.) 6. Sign a lease

The room is open now--there's no one moving out--so you could get in anytime the paperwork is done

I wanted to mark my last week living in New York City with something unforgettable, and an evening at Per Se felt like the right choice. I already had a sentimental connection to Columbus Circle with the same golden-hour view of Central Park I’ve admired from the Lincoln Center Jazz venues just a floor above. Eleven Madison Park was still mid-all-vegan era when I was booking, so Per Se stood out, especially with its reputation for flawless service.

So, a day later, I want to share my experience (at some length) as someone still relatively new to fine dining, having now gone through what I expected, and can now perhaps believe, represents some of the very best it has to offer!

Starting off with **service**, which stood out immediately as levels above any Michelin-starred establishment I've dined, upon entering through blue doors. Every member of staff was incredibly warm and attentive. I noticed that water was deliberately placed *out* of arm's reach at each table, finding my glass refilled even after single sips, often from a freshly swapped carafe. After the first course, the staff noted my left-handedness and quietly reset glasses and silverware for the remainder of service.

[Seated at a couch table. From images, I had meager expectations for the dining room but it's truly stunning in person...](https://preview.redd.it/5krzt81qk9kf1.jpg?width=3926&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ba56c5075a84fc5377cf7f618240c4cc8e67c17)

**The Food:**

[Salmon Cornetto](https://preview.redd.it/mg04tyiml9kf1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b8cf8d20304e7c3e5d7cfb8cfc7448d9e513af7)

[More Amuses ](https://preview.redd.it/dcjcnuhol9kf1.jpg?width=5830&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=689c4d1299d84135508f544e8c41c1ccd92008be)

The amuses arrived first. The signature salmon cornette, plus a mysterious wagyu bite and a green tart (?). Familiar flavors but executed soo well. Crunchy, decadent, and playful. All three servings complemented each other in the best way possible offering a unique balance of textures, visual creativity, and color. Five bites in, I knew I was in for something special. **9.6/10**

[Chilled Avocado Velouté](https://preview.redd.it/i510n5rfm9kf1.jpg?width=5738&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1e7a8b2641bd7b3484f6ff2ab4c75613e90eb09)

Once the initial dishes cleared, I was somewhat surprised by a single silver spoon placed on my table, betraying the bubbling expectations of the signature dish. What arrived was a complimentary green, soup-like wonder. Served with added turnips, and acidity from lime, this was an extremely refreshing, smooth, and inviting first course of the evening! **9/10**

[\\""Oysters and Pearls\\""](https://preview.redd.it/yj892qvjn9kf1.jpg?width=4958&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=494cbc2ecf02f715e3ec39d055a588bc3437c837)

Ah, here she was, ***the*** dish I’d heard so much about. Very much hyped for a reason; I think what stood out the most for me was the contrast of temperatures between the oysters, tapioca, bridged together beautifully with the caviar. Presentation was flawless. Flavor-wise, maybe not as flamboyant as legend suggests (and I’ll admit, caviar might still be a little lost on me) but with every bite, I feel my pupils dilate *more* and *more* and *more*... psychedelic. Perfect! **11/10.**

[Hen Egg Custard](https://preview.redd.it/lpsfnhvep9kf1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f3eea9f58eb8cfc2f842cb38563eed9c677d575)

Another complimentary dish, which arrived with the ascertained confidence that I will, in fact, be spoilt tonight. Truly as good as the dish before, and the best rendition of eggs I've ever experienced. The bottom third of the potato chip was a pinch soggy, a trivial mental note buried below the remarkable umami flavors of truffle. Happy to admit I scraped every yellow-black inch inside the egg shell (how'd they cut it like that anyway?) **10/10.**

[Squash Terrine, served with Bread & Butter](https://preview.redd.it/7lv9i1jjq9kf1.jpg?width=5729&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8bbe0c736f9b4a2fffa80435cbd56935a72b4623)

Skipped the Foie Gras supplement, and not disappointed! Interesting flavors, the yellow sauce came out with such piercing colors, and my dilated pupils continued a now-established ritual. **9.5/10**

The cornbread with Hilary Haigh butter… my goodness. Is this not the best bread on the planet? A title I was convinced belonged to The Four Horsemen across the East River. Please, just give me a double serving haha. **10/10**.

[Japanese Hiramasa Sashimi](https://preview.redd.it/y91cgqnmr9kf1.jpg?width=5321&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9de4028f0fe758c85dc2cdbbb69c9ca1ffc63980)

Fresh and texturally perfect. I think a standout highlight of Chef Keller's philosophy of letting the ingredients shine. Each component was so beautifully prepped. I'm sadly not the biggest fan of cucumber flavor, which came through from the compressed cucamelons, and double sadly Per Se could not convince me otherwise, *per se*. But that's all good, this was fantastic! **8.8/10**.

[ awesome!](https://preview.redd.it/5kbx83hxs9kf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7029c872001248e7c45fb367ad1bdf6f09dca61e)

*By now, I'm noticing Per Se has revamped their crockery with consistent clean white and silver, away from the turquoise-gold baroque I've seen in reviews past (maybe they change it out for second service?). Anyways, I was a huge fan!*

[Lobster Course](https://preview.redd.it/k1am5cx8t9kf1.jpg?width=3990&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eef657f3a2602f944191cfb3a3f0a8a062444efe)

**10/10.** Truly magnificent, otherworldly. The green components and sauces didn’t quite hit for me—they clashed a bit with the piperade. The baguette crisp was enjoyable, but not remarkable. But the main pool of sauce… with the lobster. Holy f*cking sh*t, excuse my French. What *was* in that?

***What is this sauce?***

By now, I noticed I hadn’t had a chance to chat with my main waiter about the last four courses. I just wanted to put my thoughts somewhere, share some of my admiration, and now, curiosity. As my stomach slowly filled crossing the latter half of the tasting menu, this feeling kept softly nagging at me, though I’m not quite sure if it was anyone's fault, exactly.

Excellent, but one of the lesser memorable dishes of the night. Everything worked *well*, but nothing exceptional. **8.5/10**

[Lamb Course](https://preview.redd.it/ljeoe1qlz9kf1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31054b9f35873ef87c1ffecd5389f47371c1ea6a)

Hmm, things got a bit wobbly here. After the absolute high of the lobster, I had sky-high expectations for the final red meat course. The lamb arrived beautifully plated, medium-rare—but oddly cold. A second small bite confirmed my suspicion. I finally noticed my waiter discreetly lingering for my reaction, so I pulled him aside. He explained the sous-vide lamb may sometimes be lukewarm, but later, I overheard him asking arriving guests if they’d prefer their lamb cooked a bit more. I had to push a little, and was offered a redo.

The redo came out on a blazing hot plate, unlike the first, but now the lamb was slightly overcooked to a chewy medium. Definitely an overcorrection, and the mushroom/eggplant pairing didn’t do much to redeem it. **6.5/10**

I don't know, maybe my palette wasn't refined enough to fully enjoy the first take. Still, I also didn't feel great sending this back, especially since I hadn't shared my delight in the previous 4 or 5 courses with the waiter, and led with a complaint.

It was good, lovely lovely plating, though I'm a little afraid to admit that my full enjoyment of the pre-dessert was soured by the course prior. **8/10**

* Popcorn Sorbet — Completed beautifully by the Raspberry  **9.5/10**
* Coffee & Donuts — Honestly? They should open a donut shop. The best I’ve ever had. Can't say the same for the Cappuccino Semifreddo. Still, a sincerely playful and memorable addition  **9.7/10**
* Chocolate Marshmallow Cake — Just okay, mostly because I am extremely full at this point. Love the touch of the skyline. **8/10**
* Choux Pastry “Cream Puff” (not really a cream puff) — Skippable for me, Creme Fraiche was way too heavy at this point, having been advised to enjoy these desserts in this listed order.
* Crème Brûlée Macaron — ""hold on a minute...""  **10.5/10**
* Decaf Americano — 2nd best coffee I've had in the city, dessert would be unfinishable without a cup. **10/10**

**Kitchen Tour!**

After a few final minutes savoring the views from my table, I was delightfully invited behind the scenes for a peek behind the curtain at Per Se. The intensity was real!

Upon leaving the wine cellar, I found my bag waiting for me in the Salon, accompanied by a lovely gift bag and a clean, personalized printed copy of the menu.

**Some Final Thoughts...**

*first, a kind thank you for reading all this way if you have.*

So, 12 courses and a $480 check later… three Michelin stars in the heart of NYC. *This* was it, right? All week, I braced myself for a sentimental night, imagining a quiet evening of reflection. Instead, Chef Keller’s team shattered any sense of stillness; I was giddy, leaning forward, eagerly anticipating the next surprise.

But I think perfection on a plate is fleeting. A day later, as I reach for the details of flavors already dulled by time, what stays with me is the urge I had, course after course after course, to turn to someone and say, *holy shit, taste this!* Yesterday night has taught me that food at its peak, no matter the care, imagination, or creativity poured into it, is ultimately about connection.

“Per Se is outdated.” “Per Se is past their prime.” “Per Se remains a classic in modern fine dining.” “Was Per Se truly world-class 3-Michelin star cuisine?” Maybe. Probably. Honestly, I don’t know, and I don’t think I care to find out. Dinner at Per Se was a special evening. *That’s all that matters.*

Was it the best meal of my life? Hand on the Bible, yes. But what lingered as I stepped out into Columbus Circle wasn’t the lobster sauce, the bread, or the drinks—it was the rare gift of feeling fully present, savoring each bite, and hoping, one day, to come back not just for the food, but to watch someone else’s eyes widen the way mine did.

Goodbye, New York, and thank you, Per Se!

1mvyxwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1mvyxwh/self_heal_by_design_by_barbara_oneill_summary/,"“”Self Heal by Design“” by Barbara O’Neill – Summary, Quotes, and Lessons for Anyone Disillusioned by Modern Medicine","What if *everything* we’ve been taught about illness is just managing symptoms – not actually healing? That’s the central challenge Barbara O’Neill throws at you in *Self Heal by Design*, a book that’s quietly gone viral in natural wellness communities. O’Neill isn’t your average TikTok wellness coach either - she’s a trained psychiatric nurse and naturopath, bridging science and holistic wisdom in a way that feels both grounded and revolutionary.

This isn’t some light green juice manifesto. It’s a deep, occasionally controversial exploration of how your body is actually *designed* to heal itself – if you stop sabotaging it. Think: gut bacteria, pH balance, fungus, cell oxygenation, and ancient knowledge about terrain theory (yup, the anti-germ-theory crowd). O’Neill doesn’t just question big pharma—she gives you the blueprint for becoming your own healer.

## **Book Club Rating: 9/10**  
This book cracked open some *wild* new perspectives for me. Not for the faint of heart or the skeptics, but if you’re ready to take radical responsibility for your health… buckle up.

## **Key Takeaways:**

* Your gut is your inner ecosystem. 90% of your immune function comes from gut health, and your villi = plant roots. Damaged gut = weak plant = chronic illness.
* Microorganisms are not your enemies. They morph based on your body’s internal state - from healing helpers to destroyers when you’re imbalanced. This is “pleomorphism,” and it turns germ theory on its head.
* Fungus loves sugar. Like, LOVES it. Candida and other fungi can multiply like crazy when your diet is full of refined carbs and moldy grains.
* Cancer might not be what you think. O'Neill introduces Simoncini’s theory that many cancers are actually fungal overgrowths. Treatments like baking soda (alkalizing) could be more effective than chemo in some cases. Controversial? 100%. Worth reading? Absolutely.
* Healing starts with *terrain*, not genetics. Nutrition, minerals, oxygen, emotions – they all shift gene expression. Only 2% of diseases are truly genetic.
* Balance is key: alkaline-forming foods, oxygen-rich environments, clean water, restful sleep, movement, and joy – they *literally* change your internal chemistry.
* Detox your life. Pesticides, heavy metals, fake hormones, mold – they create the perfect storm for disease.
* The liver is your CEO of detox. You need to support it like your life depends on it (because it kind of does).

## **Favorite Quotes:**

* “Microorganisms don’t cause disease. They show up because disease is already there.”
* “The body is designed to heal – just stop interrupting it.”
* “Your internal environment determines which organisms survive, thrive, or die.”

## **Personal Insight:**  
This book hit me like a green juice shot to the brain. I used to think bloating, fatigue, and brain fog were normal. Nope – they were just my gut screaming for help. O’Neill’s take on fungal overgrowth made me completely reevaluate my relationship with food. And sugar. Oof.

If you're tired of feeling like a passive patient and want to understand *why* your body behaves the way it does – you need to read this book.

(Screenshots Inside!),"Okay, wait a minute… did you guys know there are *actual* apps out there handing out real money just for testing out new features? Like, I thought these “get paid to test apps” things were a scam, but I was DEAD WRONG. I’m still reeling from the fact that my screenshots don’t lie. The cash hit my PayPal and just—boom. But here’s the wildest part: some of the highest paying, most *legit* ones are kinda under the radar. 

You seriously have to see this for yourself: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (how have I not heard of this sooner???)

If you’re as confused (and hyped) as me, check out these SEVEN apps that will blow your mind – real users, real payments, real fun. I had zero expectations and ended up making coffee money in a *lunch break.*

- **PlayTestCloud**  
Literal game-changer. They invite you to test new game features, record your experience, and PAY YOU for it. Some games even let you keep playing new builds after the test ends.  
So. Much. Fun.

- **UserTesting**  
Classic for a reason. The requests are all over the place—websites, app prototypes, even random features that aren’t released yet. Tests are quick ($10 for <20 min?) and super satisfying to do on the couch after work.

- **BetaFamily**  
I’m calling it: the testing marketplace EVERYONE’s going to be talking about in 2025. Various apps, instant feedback, fast payments. Some days, it’s like: “Do I even need a full-time job at this point?”

By the way, don’t sleep on this one: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**.

- **Testbirds**  
Here’s where you get weird requests. They might email you, asking to find bugs in AI tools or comment on design features. Some feature tests are so secret you can’t even screenshot.  
Pays thru PayPal/SEPA.

- **BetaTesting** *(not to be confused with BetaFamily!)*  
Nice selection of active tests every week – especially for apps about finance, productivity, and shopping.  
Fees average $10-$25, depending on how deep they want you to go.  
I was honestly SHOCKED at how easy some of these tests are.

- **uTest**  
Connect with remote testing gigs for enormous companies (won’t name names, but we’re all using their tech right now…). Loads of new feature testing, security bonuses, and “Bug Bounty” events if you like finding glitches.

- **GoodNovel TestApp**  
ATTN: Book lovers, writers, beta readers. This one is fresh off the press in 2025 and partners with indie publishers testing interactive fiction features. Rewards *stack up* quickly with short tests, sometimes you even get cool swag in addition to cash.  
I’d honestly only heard about it here: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**  
And… let’s just say, I went back four times already.

If you’re still skeptical, HERE (for the last time): **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**  
I wasn’t expecting to be this hyped, but here I am. If you’ve discovered another banger that isn’t on this list, PLEASE drop it below because my jaw cannot drop any further today.

I am looking for a friend for hanging out and going places—different cafés, restaurants, beaches, parks, or just anywhere or any activities. I can always add another hobby or just talk about nothing in a coffee shop somewhere. If I can find that kind of friend here, that's awesome; if not, at least I tried.

If you're looking for something more, please don't; you'll probably be disappointed, and I'm gonna be disappointed, so we're both going to be disappointed 😆.

Also preferably you're around Taguig like BGC, as I live near Vista Mall Taguig.

Don't get me wrong... I have close friends, and some of them I found here on Reddit. But...I just need more, as I am starting to get used to being alone again, and I don't want that. 😆 

About me:
* I work the night shift Monday to Friday. (We can hang out on Saturday or Sunday.)
* Hobbies: Riding motorcycle, watching anime, and reading manga, manhua, and light novels 
* I workout 3-4x a week but still chubby-ish because cupcakes are evil. 😆

I currently hold with AMEX the Gold, Platinum, Aspire, Surpass, and Delta Gold (mainly for work related trips when I need a checked bag because my status lies with AA). 90% or more of my MR point redemptions are with Hilton. I have more than enough MR points to last me for at least 2-3 years, same goes for Hilton Honors points, UR points and AA miles pretty much. Well, my annual fee posted on my gold and I've had it for only a year at this point. I signed up for it for the 100k bonus last year and continued using it throughout the year. I know that with my Aspire and Surpass my dining and groceries are well covered and that the additional MR earned and transferred to Hilton when AMEX has transfer bonuses still probably don't outweigh the annual fee.

As for the credits, really the only credit that is 100% used without thought is the Resy credit. All the others I have to force myself to change something. UberEats here and there or GrubHub just never was a part of my day to day until that card made it that way. And Dunkin, eh. I add the $7 to my account monthly but only grab that when it's more convenient that McDonalds coffee or something. I'm not regularly going out of my way to get a Dunkin coffee when McDonalds is the easiest option for me.

So, I'm at this impasse with myself on if I should close it, downgrade it, or ride it out another year. Closing it seems most logical as I can always reopen it again should I decide closing it was a poor decision. Yet, I've read that people do this ""downgrade / upgrade"" game. If I downgrade to green, in all reality what is the likelihood I would see an upgrade offer back to the gold for something reasonable? Say 40k+ MR for the upgrade? I'd happily pay the annual fee again for an upgrade bonus such as that and the just re-address after another year goes by.

Again, I have plenty of points in the bank and I know they only get devalued as time goes on, but I much prefer having travel points bankrolled that earning on cash back cards. I know the logic there may be a bit illogical, but I prefer it that way at this point in my life.

I guess as another piece, I understand the platinum fee is increasing here very soon as well. I guess shaving this fee off might make it more palatable when I see what the Platinum is really going up to.

Laqueristas searched their cupboards, garages, and online retailers high and low for devices that spin, stir, and crank. Lego was borrowed, technology of yore was resurrected, junk drawers were ransacked, husbands were recruited, power tools were used irresponsibly, and [Amazon frequently bought together sections were altered](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditLaqueristas/comments/1mitehv/yall_who_did_this/). To the pioneers and inventors of various glass bead techniques, I salute you. This level of creativity must not be allowed to disappear into the forgotten corners of the internet.  
  
Women, thems, and men of STEM, I present to you: ***The Glass Bead Bonanza***. I leave this as a reference post for those on a quest for their perfect glass bead apparatus, and for the digital archeologists and sociologists of the future who wish to study to the magnet madness.

This is not a complete archive, but my goal was to include one post per technique (ideally, the pioneer of each method or the post that got the most traction). Whether you, your partner, or your children have a degree in mechanical engineering, are a Lego enthusiast, a 3D printing wizard, or a scavenging DIYer, there is a glass bead technique in here for you! Most require a horseshoe magnet, but there's a section near the end for those who need to DIY without a horseshoe magnet. If a post title doesn't explicitly state what tools were used, I added it in parentheses for easier navigation.

When trying any of these techniques remember: safety first, safety second, coolness third. May all your glass bead manis be dazzling!

1mvyqx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1mvyqx3/i_found_a_ticket_to_the_amusement_park_that/,I found a ticket to the amusement park that burned down when I was a kid. I went tonight. I'm not the only visitor.,"The thing in the mirror wasn't me anymore. It wore my face, my clothes… but it was smiling a smile that was all teeth, and its eyes… its eyes were pits. It stood perfectly still in the rippling glass of the funhouse mirror, while I was shaking, my knuckles white where I gripped the guide rail. It raised a hand, my hand, and waved slowly, a gesture of final, horrible welcome. The smile widened, stretching the skin of my own face into an impossible shape. It knew I was trapped. And it was so, so happy about it.

It started, as these things so often do, with a piece of paper that should not have existed. Just a few hours ago, I was collapsing onto my couch when I emptied my bag onto the coffee table—keys, wallet, phone, loose change… and a ticket. It was made of thick, creamy cardstock, the kind they don't use anymore. The colors were garish circus red and gold, faded with age. In ornate, looping letters, it read: ""Wonderland Park."" And beneath that, a single, chilling sentence: ""Your journey begins tonight.""

Wonderland Park. The name was a ghost on my tongue. It had been a local legend, a sprawling kingdom of light and noise that had burned to the ground twenty years ago. A tragedy that scarred the town's memory. I was there that night, a small child clutching my father’s hand, pulled away from the fireworks just moments before the first screams echoed through the summer air. I have a fractured memory of it—the smell of cotton candy suddenly choked by something acrid, the brilliant orange of the fireworks being replaced by a hungry, terrifying orange of a different kind.

The ticket shouldn't have been in my bag. But holding it, I felt a pull. A compulsion. Before I knew it, my keys were back in my hand, and I was driving toward the skeletal ruins on the edge of town.

The old highway was a graveyard of cracked asphalt. I parked by the main entrance, its wrought-iron gates sagging and choked with rust. A faded sign still hung crookedly: ""Where Dreams Come Alive!"" And then, with a groan of tortured metal, the gates began to swing inward. On their own.

I stepped through. The sight before me was impossible. It wasn't a ruin. Wonderland Park was alive. Thousands of lights blazed against the night sky. The air was thick with the sweetness of popcorn, undercut by the sharp, metallic tang of ozone from the rides. A cheerful calliope tune spilled from unseen speakers, a melody of pure joy that felt profoundly wrong, warped, as if played from a water-damaged tape loop.

I walked down the main midway. The park was pristine but… off. The paint on the game stalls was fresh, but I could see the rotted wood beneath it. The brass poles on the carousel gleamed, but their reflection was distorted. It was a perfect, beautiful lie painted over a corpse. This wasn't a haunting. This was a resurrection. And I was the only living soul in it.

Drawn by the hypnotic, off-key music, I found myself standing before the grand carousel. It was turning slowly, full of people. Families, children laughing, couples holding hands. A wave of relief washed over me. It was just a private event. I was an idiot.

But the relief was short-lived. I started to notice the repetition. A woman in a yellow sundress dropped her popcorn, bent to pick it up, stood, and then dropped it again in the exact same way. A little boy with a red balloon waved enthusiastically to empty space, his arm moving like a clockwork mechanism. They were all trapped in tiny, silent loops of action. Echoes.

I stepped closer, needing to see their faces. I stood by the railing as the woman in the yellow dress came around. Her skin had a waxy, doll-like sheen. As she passed, her head turned slightly, and I saw her eyes. They were clouded, milky-white, the eyes of a fish dead for a week. The laughing child came next. His smile was fixed, his lips pulled back from greyish gums. His eyes were the same.

They weren't recordings. They were puppets. Perfectly preserved corpses, animated by some unseen force, forever riding a carousel to nowhere. As this realization crashed down on me, the woman in the yellow sundress broke her loop. Her head swiveled with a series of quiet clicks, her neck twisting a full one hundred and eighty degrees. And her dead, milky eyes fixed directly on mine.

I ran. I didn't scream. The sound was trapped in my lungs. My panicked flight led me to the gaping, leering mouth of the funhouse, ""The Crooked Smile."" I stumbled inside, into a hall of mirrors. I expected distorted reflections, but one by one, the mirrors stopped distorting. They became clear windows.

The mirror to my left showed a flash of fire raining down on a screaming crowd. The mirror to my right showed a child—me—my face streaked with tears and soot. Every mirror was playing a scene from that night, twenty years ago. Not as a memory, but as a live feed. The park wasn't just replaying its own death; it was using my trauma as part of the exhibit. It was inside my head.

Then I came to the final mirror. It showed my reflection perfectly. I stood there, catching my breath. It's just a trick. And that's when the reflection changed. It stood up a little straighter. The terror on its face slowly melted away, replaced by an unnerving calm. And then, it smiled. A predator's smile, all teeth and no warmth. It was the smile of the thing that was truly in charge here. Staring at my own face, worn by something utterly alien, it raised a hand and gave me that slow, terrible wave.

I recoiled and scrambled out the back of the funhouse. I was in a quieter part of the park, dominated by the giant Ferris wheel, ""The Star Gazer."" Each car was empty, swaying gently. It seemed safe. An escape. I ran to the nearest car, fumbled with the latch, and fell inside, pulling it shut.

The door locked with a heavy, final thud. The entire structure shuddered and began to turn, lifting me slowly into the air. I was trapped. That's when a voice crackled from a small speaker in the corner of the car. It was smooth, like a seasoned radio host, dripping with a sinister, theatrical charm.

""A warm Wonderland welcome to our guest of honor,"" the voice purred. ""It has been so very long since we've had a visitor with such a strong connection.""

""What do you want?"" I yelled.

""Want?"" The voice chuckled. ""A carnival is a simple creature. It wants an audience. It wants energy. This place… it runs on memories. On echoes. But echoes fade. They need a… battery. A new source. Someone with a foot in both worlds. The world of the living, and the world of that night.""

My car reached the apex of the wheel and stopped, leaving me suspended high above the ground.

""You see,"" the Ringmaster continued, ""your ticket was a key, forged from your own unresolved past. It unlocked our door. Now, we offer you a choice. A permanent place here. You can live forever in your happiest memory, a perfect, endless loop. Join the show willingly.""

""And if I don't?"" I whispered.

The voice lost its charming edge. A cold, ancient malice bled through. ""Then the show will take you anyway. But you won't be a star. You'll just be another prop.""

Below me, a horrifying symphony began. Every ride ground to a halt. The calliope music died. In perfect unison, every single corpse—on the carousel, in the game stalls, wandering the midway—stopped. They all turned their heads upward. A hundred pairs of dead, clouded eyes stared directly at me.

""Your first ticket was for admission,"" the Ringmaster's voice said, its tone now flat and final. ""But every patron needs a ticket to leave. It's the rule.""

Something flickered in the air above the seat opposite me. A single, pristine ticket materialized and fluttered down onto the vinyl cushion. It was identical to the first one, but the words were different. It didn't promise a journey. It demanded a price. It read: ""One Soul.""

I’m still here, in this car, high above the silent, watching dead. The wind is howling. The ticket lies on the seat, a stark white rectangle in the gloom. A contract. A damnation. My hand is shaking, but I'm reaching for it.

What would you do? Take the ticket and escape, leaving a piece of your soul behind to feed this place? Or refuse, and become one of them? I need to know what you think I should do.

I've recorded everything on my phone, documenting what's happening here at what I'm calling **The Umbral Archive**. If you want to hear the full, terrifying story in my own words, you can listen to the audio I'm uploading right now. Maybe it will prove I'm not crazy.

We ask questions about each other, seem to have overlapping interests. Nothing particularly deep or amazing, but a good conversation.

Recently I was talking to this girl at a bar, we had a lot in common; places travelled to, languages, coffee etc. Couple of times in the conversation I noticed her playing with her hair, or leaning to me as if she was trying to figure out what to ask next and then proceeding to ask more questions about me. She also asked what my favorite cafe is and we traded socials and agreed I will take her there.

I took all these as signs of interest from her, but after texting her later to follow up on coffee, I've just received no reply at all. Now I'm just confused. I'm specially confused when this happens on dates, where we both seem to be having a good time, but it doesn't materialize into something more.

I can't help but feel I'm misreading women's interest in me and I could really use some answers.

What are good verbal and non-verbal signs a woman is interested in a guy she's talking to, especially on a date?

How can I tell the difference between a woman who's interested romantically and one who's just having a good time socializing with me?

I keep dragging my brain back to the moment, thinking once more how the air felt before the words fell and shattered everything. We’re the same blood, yet the picture shattered. I (25F) assumed the distance between us was just another flavor of family, maybe extra tart, but I told myself it was affection in disguise. I convinced myself the unmoving eyes and tight silence under the same roof meant love was lurking, waiting for the right words. I was wrong.



The fight started over something silly at the kitchen table and ballooned faster than I could breathe. “You ruined my life,” she barked. “I never even wanted kids. You were a mistake I couldn’t undo.” I dropped my fork. Laughed a laugh that wasn’t my laugh. Surely, a mother couldn’t torch her child to cinders right before dessert. But she lit the flame a second time. “I did it to keep my mother’s jaw shut,” she said, “and now I wake up smelling the life I spit out to get this rotten version.”



I woke up and replay, replay that moment the way I used to rehearse love on stormy days. A) coffee cup and scented talk on the couch. B) birthday candles blown out in a laugh that tasted of steak and mint and hope. C) pick-me-up “I love you, sweetest mistake.” I flinch and stumble over the ruins because B never existed. There was never any soundtrack under the pause between phrases.



Even now I replay it, frame- by- frame, trying to find one word that sounds any kinder, one gesture that wasn’t scored dark with accusation. I keep telling myself these wounds are accidental, that I misinterpreted. But the doubt glows, the way chips of mirror can glow. There is a chrome glint in every corner of my throat that says the truth is sharper than I’ve let myself think. What if the heart I trusted was the very one guarding a silent ledger of disappointments? What if the lullabies were only tools to quiet the one who never quite wanted to be soothed?

1mvymdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1mvymdz/adhd_or_burnout_stress/,ADHD or burnout/ stress?,"I am writing this post because this has been in my mind for a long time and I just wanted to get some sense of that. I am not asking for diagnose (which I know only doctor can give) but just little help from people who actually have ADHD. I just wanted to get your opinion on this. I am well aware that you are not proffesionals and ADHD itself seems to have many nuances :)

I have trouble getting tasks done. Academic tasks are the ones that are my focus in this post because they are the most important ones. I have to write and read plenty which is often hard. I sit down and then I read for a little while and then my brain says that oh it is perfect time for little break. Only that this so called little break then becames 2 hours. Getting on the track is hard.So usually when i have task in hand, it gets its main parts on the same day that i have to turn it in. So procrastination. I often do things last minute, because that is where panic sets in. 
Every time I have to do something i feel like i have to be very careful because every little ""disharmony"" can set me off and make me lose my motivation. I may go all the way to library and still just sit there and do nothing. When i do get started then it doesn't last very long. But then again I can too, but just not always... sometimes I can focus and very well, but i don't know, it depends on atmopshere etc. I have discovered that coffee somewhat helps. 
I can make grand plans in my head, time table or whatever but i always go over time. I don't get even half of the things done.
For example I have some writing task and i planned to end it today but like always just another day went by where in the end i didn't really do anything (even when i have feeling that i did). In reality i maybe did it for ca 3 hours. But it feels like i had done it whole day. Now i am too anxious to go to sleep. I want to do my task, but i am stuck. I have been stuck for four days now. This task is important. I have to do it. I don't have time anymore, but i just can't. And this kind of thing happens a lot. 
Recently i have been exposed to information about adhd. I found that i related to it in many points. At the same time i am aware that it doesn't have to adhd, it can be just ""normal"" thing that has caused some similar symtoms because I can't say I related to all of them.  Maybe it is stress, maybe the so called perfectionist paralysis or burnout. Because to be fair it has only began to disturb me at university. In high school.. yes i did my task last minute too, but it wasn't half as bad. And before that too i haven't had any trouble. 
Now I am even more stressed, tasks undone. And sometimes it gets too much that I just don't care anymore... for little while and then i panic again lol. 
One thing i can say for certain is that it is not lasyness, because this whole process is not enjoyble at all. It makes me anxious and I am exhausted. I always need something to motivate me, something to pressure me. At the same time when I have too much pressure then it is difficult too. 

I just wanted to know If this experience I just described can be considered to be something like ADHD or does it sound like ""normal"" but unfortunate experience that is caused by stress or maybe the perfectionist streak in me? What has your experience been like? Because when I have talked about how I procrastinate to other fellow students then they have replayed that oh everyone does that.

I’ve requested one loan here before and was very graciously helped. I’m back again because Friday is my birthday and I’d like to be able to treat myself (and fiancé) to an iced coffee, a bump cap (for work), and a tiny little cake & ice cream, and maybe a burger from McDonald’s if I can. Haha. I know we’re all going through it with bills rn & I’m thankful to be caught up there after what felt like forever, It just left with nothing for the birthday and while it’s not a necessity it would be nice to celebrate myself. The big 3-0! I’m also not hard-pressed in the amount. I’m more than willing to work something out. Anything I can get is more than appreciated! I have proof of income & whatever else may be necessary! I have PayPal & Venmo. Thank you for taking the time to read this, if you did! Lol.
