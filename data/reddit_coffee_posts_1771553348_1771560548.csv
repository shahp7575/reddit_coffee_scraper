1r9kkqb,https://v.redd.it/84k99b7mkkkg1,How to Make Your Office Plastic Free in 2026 (Sustainable Workplace Tips for Companies),"Plastic free isn’t just a lifestyle trend anymore it’s becoming a workplace responsibility. If your company is working toward sustainability goals, ESG compliance, or simply wants to reduce waste, here are 5 practical ways to create a plastic free office in 2026.

# 1️⃣ Switch to Reusable Containers & Cutlery

Single use plastics in office pantries add up fast.

Encourage:

* Reusable water bottles
* Steel or glass coffee cups
* Ceramic plates & cutlery instead of disposables

Small change. Massive long term waste reduction.

# 2️⃣ Use Eco Friendly Office Stationery

Office supplies are often hidden plastic contributors.

Switch to:

* Recycled paper
* Banana fiber pens
* Refillable markers
* Wooden pencils

These sustainable office supplies reduce landfill waste while supporting conscious production.

# 3️⃣ Rethink Office Packaging & Deliveries

From shipping materials to snack packaging, plastic sneaks in everywhere.

Prioritize:

* Compostable packaging
* Recyclable courier materials
* Bulk snack purchasing to reduce wrappers

This supports zero waste office initiatives and aligns with corporate sustainability goals.

# 4️⃣ Introduce Sustainable Corporate Gifting

Corporate gifting is often plastic heavy bubble wrap, synthetic materials, throwaway packaging.

Instead, choose practical, plastic free alternatives like:

* Eco friendly office bags
* Sustainable wallets
* Reusable pouches

Brands like MaLeeMa focus on plastic free design and even contribute carbon credits, helping companies reduce and offset their footprint while offering meaningful employee or client gifts.

# 5️⃣ Educate & Motivate Your Team

A plastic free office isn’t just procurement it’s culture.

Host:

* Sustainability workshops
* Plastic free challenges
* Monthly green habit goals

When employees adopt conscious workplace habits, impact multiplies at work and at home.

# Final Thought

A plastic free office in 2026 isn’t about perfection.  
It’s about consistent conscious choices.

Culture > Compliance.  
Responsibility > Trend.

If more businesses take small steps, the collective impact becomes massive.

OA Lang Ba Ako?","May small business ako — cookies and coffee — pero sideline lang siya kasi malakas lang tuwing Christmas or pag may birthdays. Since 2010 may sari-sari store kami ni Mama. Malakas siya before, pero around 2018 humina na talaga, konti na lang bumibili.

This 2025, I decided to focus on the sari-sari store again. Nag-invest ako, and my partner also helped us financially para ma-revive yung tindahan. This February naging busy ako kasi nag-open ako ng physical store, so hindi ako masyado nakatutok sa sari-sari.

After one week, nag-check ako ng pera kasi kailangan mag-restock sa tindahan. Nagulat ako kasi ₱800 lang yung cash on hand, knowing na kumikita dapat kami ng around ₱2k–₱4k per day. Ubos yung stocks pero halos walang income.

I asked my mom saan napunta yung pera. Sabi niya, “ewan.”

Now I’m starting to realize why some of our neighbors and even relatives don’t like her when it comes to money issues. And that realization hurts me even more. I don’t want to think badly of my own mom, but I also worked hard and invested my own money here.

1r9kd08,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThrillSleep/comments/1r9kd08/the_last_call/,The Last Call,"Julian Cross was not what I expected my neighbor to look like. He was quiet in ways that felt deliberated, his waves measured, as though even more casual gestures require thought before being released into the world. I noticed him because he was attractive, and I hated myself a little more for that. Attraction makes excuses long before the reason has a chance to intervene. Julian moved in last August with his girlfriend, Claire. Claire and I became very close quickly. We went for manicures and pedicures together, and every 1^(st) Sunday we went for brunch something that became a routine long enough to feel permanent. She had a laugh that filled silence easily. The kind of person who made you feel less alone by sitting across from her.

In December, I walked over to Jillian and Claire's house to pick her up for brunch like usual Gillian answered the door.

“Oh, hey, Hannah,” he said. “How are you today?”

“I'm doing well. I'm here to pick up Claire.”

He hesitated for only a second, but I noticed it.

“Claire's not here at the moment,” he said. “She had to go deal with the family situation back in Mississippi.”

“Oh,” I replied. “I thought she was still here. She never texted or called me.”

“It was a last minute”, Jillian said quickly. “She had to rush out.”

I nodded and turned away, walking back across the street to my house. Halfway to my front door, the unease settled in quiet but insistent. Something wasn’t right. Claire would have told me. She always did.  And the last time we spoke she mentioned growing up in New York, not Mississippi. 

I told myself it wasn’t my place to question it. Still, the feeling followed me inside, lingering long after the door closed behind me. Two months prior, Clarie was acting strange so different that it felt like someone had taken the spark out of her, leaving her to slowly fade away. I didn’t want to overstep my boundaries with her because we have only been friends for five months, and maybe she was just one of those people that have mood swings. We did know each other that well. 

 But still that uneasy feeling never left. Weeks went by, then months, without a single call or a text from Clarie. Eventually, I went back over to talk to Julian. I knocked on the door, and he answered, 

“Uh…. hello Hannah” he said 

“Hi Julian. Have you heard anything from Clarie recently? I’m worried about her.”

The house felt empty, like something was missing. 

“Yes. She just called me,” he said but it felt like a lie. 

“Oh, really? Let me try calling her.”

“No!” he exclaimed. 

As I dialed her number, I heard a phone ring from inside the house. Then the door slammed shut. So, I knew something was wrong either was there, or she was dead. I had a feeling he had done something to her. I remembered back in October how, anytime Julian called or texted, she jumped to answer right away or check her phone with visible worry. It was like she feared him, like if she didn’t answer fast enough, something bad would happen

I took note of it because I had been in a similar situation years ago, and I recognized the signs. Still, I didn’t want to address it. I was scared, and I didn’t know if it was in my place. Men like Julian makes it easy to love them but if you push them too far, things can turn violent, or even deadly. So, I was worried, but I couldn’t tell the police anything without any evidence. A single phone call from inside the house couldn’t mean anything on its own.  

So, I started watching him, especially when he left, he left the house. The first couple of days, he left around the same time I did for work. He waved to me like usual, and I waved back, forcing a smile even though my stomach was tight with unease.

 I watched him at night too. When it got dark, I listened to the noises coming from across the street. It felt oddly silent, but through the curtains I could see him pacing back and forth in the living room. I took note it. It was like he was hiding something, something he was trying to hide from everyone. 

I was sleeping when, at around three in the morning, I heard a door slam. I jumped out of bed and rushed to the window. Julian’s house sat directly across from mine, and I had a clear view of the front door. I watched as he stepped outside, pulling the door shut behind him. 

He didn’t look around. He just walked to his car like he knew no one was watching. 

Behind me, my dog climbed off the bed, his nails clicking softly on the hard wood floors. He stood perfectly still, staring out of the window beside me. A low sound rumbled in his chest not a bark, not a growl, but something uneasy in between. 

“Why is he leaving at this hour? What could he possibly be doing?” I thought

Julian’s car pulled away, disappearing down the street, but my dog didn’t move. He kept watching the empty driveway long after the car was gone. Like he knew something was wrong. By the time the sun came up, Jillian’s car was back in the driveway. I didn't hear it return. That bothered me more than it should have.

I tried to go about my morning like everything was normal. I made coffee. I fed the dog. I stood at the kitchen sink longer than necessary, staring out the window of my house across the street, Jillian’s front door opens just as I turned away. 

He stood there for a moment, scanning the street. 

When is eyes landed on my house, they stayed there.

I stepped back from the window, my heart thudding heart in my chest. A second later, my dog let out a low growl from behind me. Not loud just enough to let me know he felt it too.

Later that afternoon, Gillian caught me outside as I was taking my dog for a walk.

“Your dog doesn’t like me much, “he said, smiling, though it didn’t reach his eyes. 

I tightened my grip on the leash. “He usually friendly.”

Julian crouched down slightly, holding out a hand. My dog pulled back, pressing against my leg, the same uneasy sound rumbled in his chest. 

Jillian straightened slowly. His smile faded. 

“Funny,” he said. “Animals usually have good instincts.”

My phone felt heavier in my pocket. 

I thought the voicemail I hadn't deleted. The one I listened to so many times I could hear it throughout pressing play. Claire's voice small, rushed, afraid. The way she'd said his name, like it hurt her mouth to do so

Julian didn't know that I had that. 

But my dog did.

He looked past me then really looked at me and something passed between us. Not fear. Not anger. Awareness.

I realized in that moment he knew I was watching him. And worse he was watching me too. 

That night, I listen to the voicemail again

I told myself it was the only checking the timestamp. That maybe, if I stared at the day long enough, it would tell me something new. But that was a lie. I knew every second of it already. I could hear it in my sleep, in the pause between thoughts. Still, my thumb hovered over the screen like I was afraid it might burn me.

The message had come in at 11:47 PM the night before Claire disappeared.

I press play.

At first there was only silence. Not dead silence something breathed on the other end, shallow and uneven, then a soft rustling like fabric shifted against skin.

“Hannah,” Claire whispered.

The sound of her voice made my chest tighten. It was smaller than I remembered. Careful. Like she was afraid someone might hear her say my name.

“I, I don't have much time,” she said. “If he finds out I called you”

she stopped, inhaling sharply. I could hear her trying not to cry.

“I need your help.”

I closed my eyes

in the background, something creaked. Wood settling, maybe. Or footsteps. I turned the volume up realized without realizing it, my heart thudding louder than the speaker.

“I told my mom,” Claire continued. “I told her I'm not happy. That I'm scared. She wants me to come home, Hannah. She said she'll buy me a ticket. I just”

a muffled sound cutter off. A thud. Not loud, but heavy enough that I felt it in my stomach

Claire's sucked in a breath.

“He pushed me last night,” she said quickly, her words tumbling over one another now.” down the stairs. He said it was an accident, but I know it wasn't. I know it. My arm” she broke off again, her breathing ragged. “I can't stay here anymore.”

Another pause. Longer this time. 

Somewhere in the distance, A door closed.

Claire lowered her voice even further. “I was going to ask if you can come over tomorrow. Just for a little while. I don't need to take much. I just need to get out.” 

My nails dug into my palms.

There was a faint sound then so soft I hadn't even noticed it first dozen times I listened. A man's voice, far away but unmistakable. Jullian I couldn't make out the whole words, only the tone. Tight. Controlled. 

Claire froze mid-sentence. 

“Hannah,” she whispered, and now she was crying. “If you don't hear from me” 

the voicemail cuts off

I stared at my phone long after the screen went dark.

My dog lifted his head from the floor beside the bed, ears pricked. He hadn't been asleep. He rarely was anymore. When I replayed the voicemail, he always listened, like he understood what it was being said. 

“I should have answered,” I whispered

the room felt so small. Every shadow looked heavy, thicker, like it might move if I turned my back on it. I replayed this message again, this time focusing on the sounds instead of the words. Creek. The thud. the door.

Stairs.

My stomach twisted.

Outside, across the street, a light flickered on in Jillian’s house.

I froze. 

I didn't know how long I stood there, watching the glow behind his curtains. I imagined him pacing again, replaying the same moment in his head the way I was. Wondering what Claire had said. Who she had called. What she had left behind. 

My phone vibrated in my hand. 

A text message 

**Julian**:   
Hey Hannah. Everything okay? I thought I saw your light on. 

My dog growled low in his throat. 

I didn’t reply. 

Instead, I opened my notes app and wrote down everything I could remember dates, times, the sound of Clarie’s voice, the way Julian’s eyes lingered on my house. I saved the voicemail to three different places. I emailed it to myself. Then. I turned my phone off completely. 

Because now I understood something I hadn’t before.   
Clarie hadn’t disappeared. 

She had tried to escape 

And Julian knew I was the last person she had reached out to. I didn’t sleep that night. 

By morning, I knew two things for certain: Claire had tried to leave, and Jillian knew I knew. 

The proof set heavy in my pocket as I crossed the street later that afternoon Claire's voicemail saved, duplicated, and impossible to erase. My dogs did close to my leg, every muscle tight, watching the house the way he always did now.

Julian answered the door almost immediately.

“Hey, Hannah.” He said, smiling. It was the same smile he always used pleasant, practiced. “Everything OK?”

I looked past him into the house. It smelled wrong. Not rotten, not sharp. Just scrubbed. Like something had been cleaned too thoroughly.

“I think Claire left something here,” I said.

His eyes flicked to my pocket. Just for a second.

“She was always forgetting some things,” he replied.

I nodded.” She left a voicemail.”

The smile didn't disappear. It stilled

for a moment, neither of us spoke. The house felt like it was holding its breath. 

“She was confused,” Jillian said finally. “She got emotional sometimes.”

“She was scared.” I spoke. “And she told someone”

 that did it.

The air shifted. His shoulders tightened, his jaw locking like something inside of him just snapped into place.

What the universe behind me, my dog growled.

Jillian glanced down at him, then back at me.” Animals react to fear,” he said. “Sometimes they sense it in people who imagine things.”

“I'm not imagining anything,” what I said. “And neither did her mother.”

That was the first time he blinked.

I stepped back from the doorway. “The voicemails timestamp doesn't match your story. I did not see it and the sound in the background stairs. You told the police she fell once, remember?”

His hand tightened on the door frame.

“I've already sent copies,” I said. “If anything happens to me, it will go straight to them.”

For a long moment, I thought he might lunge at me. I saw it in his eyes the calculation, the instinct. Then, just as quickly, it was gone. 

“Get off my property,” he said. 

I didn't argue.

Two days later, the police returned

they found Claire's phone hidden behind the vent. They found a suitcase half packed in the attic. They found bruises and photographs saved to a cloud storage, timestamps lining up too cleanly to ignore. And eventually, they found the truth ugly, small, irreversible.

Jillian said it was an accident. 

He always did.

They took him away just before sunset. As the cars pulled off my dog barked for the first time since Claire disappeared sharp, loud, certain. 

The house across the street went dark that night.

Weeks later, I met Claire's mother. I gave her the voicemail, and she cried the way people do when grief finally has somewhere to land. She hugged me like I was the last thing her daughter had touched. 

Sometimes, late at night, I still hear the door slam in my dreams. 

But the street is quiet now. And when my dog sleeps, he does so peacefully, no low growl in his chest.

Claire didn't make it out.

But she was heard.

And sometimes that's enough to stop the monster from disappearing completely.

(5700 yonge specifically)

I have worked at other places in downtown for other internships and in all of these places we didn’t have a massive requirement to be in office at all but they had very nice offices. By that I mean curved monitors / coffee machines etc which was honestly pretty normal across all of them.

I initially didn’t think much about this when I got locked into the Ops offer, but I have to say I am fairly disappointed by what I’ve seen. I am aware of the sentiment around spending taxpayers money and the like but honestly these offices don’t even make me feel like working at all.

While I do not expect a UHD curved monitor I would definitely expect more organized seating spaces , larger desks, better monitors than even the new ones they got us right now. Even the new monitor setups got cluttered and messed with very fast. 

I think with all the ruckus around RTO and the way this organization has been , I feel if the government genuinely invested into the offices at least it would encourage a great work culture, especially for newer hires. ",5,1771557569.0,OntarioPublicService,2,0.86,False
1r9k90s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1r9k90s/advice_aio_for_blaming_my_sister_for_making_my/,"ADVICE / AIO for blaming my sister for making my home a horror, and my parents divorce?","Hi, I’m kylix (16F)

My sister Catherine (24F), still lives at home with me (16F), and my parents and is unemployed. To be clear Catherine has had mental health issues, specifically psychosis e.g hearing voices, paranoia, aggression. Catherine has been placed on section (for non uk readers being placed into a psych ward against your will) twice. 

For background on Catherine, she has recently been diagnosed with both autism and dyspraxia. Around the ages 23-24.

The reason I mention her diagnosis’s is because her autism is the main label she hides behind in order to excuse herself of any responsibility / accountability! As someone with autism myself a large chunk of the stuff she claims is because of her autism, is endlessly frustrating. 

To be clear Catherine growing up, never struggled socially nor academically. It’s important to note my brother (27M) is schizophrenic and has autism, so my parents were always looking out for signs or traits of autism in my other siblings, and myself. 

The reason I’m mentioning she didn’t appear to struggle as a child / teenager, is because it feels as though she has regressed. In terms of since receiving her diagnosis she’s tried HARDER to fit into the label, if you get me? 

Catherine is the epitome of someone who is self-absorbed, entitled, and overall ungrateful. She has a MASSIVE victim complex, and never considers anyone else’s feelings. Catherine has lived at home since coming home from uni, (which is when her psychotic episode started) Catherine doesn’t cook, clean, wash up, do her own laundry, nor clean her own bathroom. She receives money from my dad (57M) whenever she asks, and is straight up ungrateful for anything my DISABLED / CHRONICALLY ILL mother (52F) does for her. 

Another thing, my sister is a compulsive liar. I really wish I was exaggerating. It ranges from experiences in her life, to BEING RAPED? I wouldn’t be mentioning this if I wasn’t 100% sure she was lying about such a thing. My sister has lied about many things, and gaslighting and manipulation are her favourite tactics in an arguments. 

My parent’s marriage was born to die, so to speak. I’ve always been aware of this, however going back to the manipulation my sister consistently turns my parents against one another, e.g lying to my dad about something my mum had done, vice versa. It’s never taken a lot for my parents to argue but I would say Catherine is the cause of 80% of them. 

When Catherine was first going through psychosis, she came home on the train from uni with a knife in her backpack because she thought people were after her. When she did come home, my mum tried to calm her down by telling her the voices weren’t real etc. This only made things worse, Catherine then physically assaults my mum, who by the way is LEGALLY DISABLED. 

Background, my mum was born with a hole in her back, which got worse over the years. 2016 she had major back surgery where they placed plates, and screws in and it unfortunately left her with nerve damage. 

I had to do something I never thought I would have to do, I had to call the police on my own sister. I was around 14 at the time, and I don’t believe is something a 14 year old should ever have to do. When it was made clear to my sister that I was calling the police, she then attacks me. When the police do eventually arrive my sister is arrested for 2 charges of assault. My mum, being my mum doesn’t press charges. 

It’s been a known fact in my family, NO ONE takes responsibility for how they act, or how they make others feel. My sister being the main person, my parents coddle. Her entire life, someone (my mum or dad) has always been there to mop up her mess, to tell her she’s the victim, that it’s not her fault and it’s everyone else’s fault. 

I have made it clear to both my parents, I think some of the reason my sister has a victim complex, and is so entitled is because she’s been given everything on a silver platter. 

One example, (which there are THOUSANDS) of my sister’s victim complex. Is when my mum, Catherine, my aunt, my grandma, and great aunt went out for coffee. Everything appeared to be fine, but when my mum and sister arrived home Catherine went off of it. Claiming everyone ignored her, no one was interested in what she had to say, etc. USUALLY when Catherine simply claims something that isn’t true, my parents label it as “that’s just how she interpreted it” but luckily, this time my mum was there and saw EVERYTHING. My aunt was very persistent in asking Catherine about job applications, how she was feeling, etc. As well as my grandma, and great aunt involving her in their conversation. 

There are multiple instances where such things have happened, where even if someone else’s feelings have gotten hurt, so beit me or my mum. She is ALWAYS the victim, and everyone is out to get her. 

I suffer chronically with anxiety, which makes it more difficult for me to attend school. This is important because my mum and sister were arguing, (as per). I SIMPLY walked across the landing to go downstairs, when my sister started calling out at me making fun of not only my anxiety but began to claim I was a narcissist. 

As someone who I would say is pretty well educated, in terms of psychology if ANYONE is the narcissist it is her. 

Catherine has made this home, a horror. I dread coming home every day because it’s like walking on eggshells. My poor mum who has SO much on her plate with my other siblings, and I hate to say it my problems, has only tried to help Catherine and it constantly gets thrown in her face. 

My dad is the least supportive husband you could fathom! he has never, not once. EVER backed up my mum in any parenting. In my entire lifetime, and as I know all of my siblings. 

Now, my parents should probably of never gotten married. However, they did. For the majority of my childhood, it was a semi happy household and by that I mean ages 8-10. Since Catherines psychosis my mum has brought up divorcing my dad to me. I fully support her in this, as he is genuinely like a robot with no emotions, and has no consideration for how anyone else feels, probably due to his undiagnosed autism. BUT not an excuse. My dad has never been there emotionally for me, and the last 3 years physically as well due to working abroad. 

My mum has brought up divorcing my dad up to me before, probably from ages 12, up until now. But this time it’s different, it’s not just saying it. She has a plan, of what she’s going to do financially, where she would move etc. 

Unknown to me up until this point, my dad has been bringing up how my mum is dangerous, out of control, emotionally abusive, as well as saying he’s going to divorce her to my sister. 

TO BE SO CLEAR if anyone is dangerous it is my dad, my parents have never laid a fist on me. HOWEVER I lived in a house where my dad would get physical with my mum, smash plates, break things etc. Here’s a hot take, a marriage should be between two people, and instead of talking to your kids about it, and not each other. TALK TO EACHOTHER. 

I am not all that bothered about my parents divorcing (my therapist would say differently), as chances are my bum of a sister will live with my dad, and me with my mum. 

My family also consistently makes me feel like I’m losing my mind emotionally, something TRAUMATIC will occur, and if I’m not “emotionally” over it within the same time frame as everyone else (genuinely 3 seconds) I’m insane? 

I would just like strangers input on this situation, as I don’t feel I have anyone to talk to about this. AIO for blaming my sister for reaking havoc in my house, as well as my parents divorce, or am I blaming her for something that was already happening? ",0,1771557503.0,Advice,0,0.5,False

I’ve been struggling with depression since I can remember… crying in my room under my blankie not being able to explain the way my heart hurt and my body freezes. 

I’m 28 now. I have great best friends, I have a family.. two siblings and some parents. I have a job that’s pretty good, my team is great, and I’m happy with the people I work with. 

I’ve been prescribed antidepressants over the years, they work until they don’t. 

My family tells me I can get through it, and I need therapy. 

Everytime I open up to someone, I’m left feeling like it was a waste of time. 

The thing is? I don’t need the therapy, I get it. 

I live at home again, it’s draining. I barely have the energy to think my own thoughts, I just exist. 

I’ve been having panic attacks, I cry everyday. It takes everything I’ve got not to replace this pain with something physical. 

I miss the sleep medicine they gave me. A few months ago, I gave it to my mom because I didn’t trust myself. 

I’m craving them in the way I want to drink the whole bottle with my iced coffee in the morning. 

I want one day to be the end, just so maybe I could feel like I could appreciate a moment. I want to find peace in the way I know I can’t when I have to wake up and do this again. 

I know it’s bad. Every-time I try to explain I don’t have energy, I’m struggling, I hate this.. it turns into my fault in still in it. 

How do you explain the way you breathe is just enough for air?

I’m tired. I’m really tired of all of this. I wanted change for so long, I hoped it’d go away. I tried real hard too, but it’s always going to be here with me.

1r9k6jg,https://www.reddit.com/r/PixoMap/comments/1r9k6jg/title_welcome_to_rpixomap_this_is_what_were/,👋 Title: Welcome to r/PixOmaP — This is what we’re building here 🗺️,"Somewhere in a city you’ve never been to, there is a coffee shop with handwritten menus and light coming through the window at exactly the right angle. There is a flea market where someone is selling a leather jacket for €8. There is a street food stall where the same family has made the same dish for thirty years, and a queue of locals at 11am is the only review you need.

None of that is on the first page of Google.

That’s why we’re here.

r/PixOmaP is a community for travelers who explore by interest. People who plan a trip around a bookshop, a record shop, a specialty coffee trail, a vintage district, or the best bowl of noodles in a city they’re visiting for the first time. People who find the place first, and figure out the rest later.

This is where you share those finds — as photo-pinned maps, location tips, photo posts, questions, and stories. And where you discover what other people have found before you.

A few things you can do here from day one:

Drop a pin. Share a photo and a location of somewhere worth knowing about — a café, a market stall, a hidden bar, a bookshop, a mural, a record shop, a thermal bath. Tell us why it matters.

Build a city map. Posting a collection? A “best of” for a city or neighborhood? Even better. That’s the heart of what PixOmaP is built for.

Ask the community. Heading somewhere and looking for the real version of it? Ask here. This community knows things the guidebooks don’t.

Share the story. The best finds always have one. The wrong turn. The local who pointed you somewhere. The thing you almost walked past. We want to hear it.

The PixOmaP app gives you the tools to turn all of this into beautiful, shareable maps — photo pins, curated trails, city guides across 300 cities. But this community exists whether you’re using the app or not. You’re welcome here if you’re simply a curious traveler who believes that a city is best understood through what you seek inside it.

Every map posted here is someone’s love letter to a city.

We’re glad you found us. Now tell us — what’s the best thing you’ve discovered somewhere that no one else seems to know about?

The Community Rules

Rule 1 — Share something real

Every post should point to a real place. If you’re sharing a recommendation, a map, or a photo pin — make sure it’s somewhere you’ve actually been, or somewhere you can genuinely vouch for. This community runs on honest firsthand knowledge.

Rule 2 — Include a location

All place posts must name the city, neighborhood, or specific location. A beautiful photo with no context helps no one. Even a rough “Shimokitazawa, Tokyo” or “somewhere near the Marais, Paris” is enough to get started.

Rule 3 — Photos are welcome, but context is required

Images are encouraged — this is a visual community. But a photo alone isn’t a post. Tell us what it is, where it is, and why it’s worth someone’s time. One sentence is enough.

Rule 4 — No spam, no self-promotion without soul

Businesses, creators, and app developers are welcome here, but lead with value not promotion. Posting your own café, shop, or city guide is fine as long as it serves the community. Pure advertising will be removed.

Rule 5 — Respect the places you share

Some of the best spots in this community are hidden for a reason. Be mindful of overtourism. If a place is fragile, small, or local-only — share thoughtfully. Don’t post exact addresses for places that have explicitly asked not to be shared widely.

Rule 6 — Be generous with knowledge

If someone asks for recommendations in a city you know — answer. This community only works if people give as well as take. Respond to questions where you can. Upvote good finds. Say thank you when someone helps you.

Rule 7 — No hate, no harassment, no politics

This is a community about places, not people’s opinions on each other or the world. Keep it warm, curious, and generous. Disagreements about the best coffee city are encouraged. Everything else stays civil.

Rule 8 — Lost and found belongs here

Can’t remember the name of that place you visited three years ago? Trying to track down a market you saw in a video? Post it. The community will help. “Help me find this place” posts are fully welcome.",1,1771557306.0,PixoMap,0,1.0,False

As the title says, M33, 1M77, never ever wanted kids, I love them more than you think and I earned the title of ""Best uncle in the world"" from my niece and nefews 😎 As long they're not mine. 

Spent the last 8 years with my company, traveled most of the world with it, but it was a toll and I left it. Based in Algeria for now but most likely will be in Qatar in a couple of months. So I don't mind your religion, political views, your 420 views or anything generally, I'm chill with anyone. 

I dated many nationalities, I don't mind cultural shock so anyone one from the world is welcome, only females 🤨 

Looking for someone who doesn't mind a nerd, a movie addict (my taste in movies and TV shows is better than anyone, I'll die on this hill), a cuddling addict, tea and coffee drinker, knows a plethora of random fun facts, doesn't like sports even though I spent most of the last years working for FIFA. And much more as long as you dig deep enough. 

That was scratching the surface, I love texting for LDRs, or spending a whole day watching movies, cuddling and eating cold pizza from yesterday. I am kind of an introvert but I don't mind parties or pubs (Guinness is the best beer in the world, another hill I'm willing to die on). 

I don't like rushing things so you're welcome to text me and check if there's a chemistry, if not, it's not the end of the world. 

Well, that was it. I'll update the post even if a miracle happens. 

Love you all CFs, never change your mind about it or cave in under pressure.

1r9k1n1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatholicDating/comments/1r9k1n1/can_you_help_me_with_this_odd_situation/,Can you help me with this odd situation?,"Ok so I I’m F26 was seeing this guy same age and long story short he lives 6 hours away in a state that I had planned to move to (this comes into play later). We met on hinge and had some FaceTimes that went rly well and then over Christmas we went on 4 dates (his family lives in my city and he was home for the holidays). We talked about all the right stuff that we align on (Catholic faith, dating for marriage, family, kids, etc) and have attraction and chemistry and both of us mentioned how surprised we were just how well we matched up. He even invited me to dinner with his family and I’d only known him in person for like two weeks but he was excited and so was I. Sounds too good to be true right?

So, he goes back to his city and I notice something is off (bc I can be anxious and just feel those shifts so easily) and ask him if he’s ok. He tells me that he just needs time to think about if this is right. I said is it me or circumstance? He said and I quote “that’s the thing is there is nothing wrong about you, in fact you are everything I could want”. (Now keep in mind we had a brief convo on a date about his job and the distance (even though I’ve been already applying to jobs there and he’s been telling me he hopes I get one bc he’d love for me to be in his city). He works for a company that requires him to travel pretty much year round so he asked my thoughts on that and I said there no harm in trying and he said great and was happy about it). So naturally I was confused why he’d need time if we both felt it was right. Turns out he was feeling weird since our last date feeling like it was moving fast, and decided to invite me to meet his parents and family to help “fix” the feeling. I was unaware of this and I thought he was so into me and that’s why I was meeting his family not under surveillance and testing. He has never brought a girl home to meet his family so all around it’s odd circumstances with pacing and all.

So end of the day he tells me he doesn’t think it’s time for him to put in the effort right now with being long distance with his job and “never being able to see me”. He wanted to keep in touch and said he’d be the first time help me move and take me to dinner when I get a job in his city.

I know what you’re thinking- he’s stinging me along. Well, slowly it’s been a month and our convos have slowed and the Instagram dms have as well. The spark is pretty much burnt out.

I did ask him while we were still talking frequently where his head was at. He told me he wants to take things slow and go on coffee shop dates and pickleball dates (stark contrast from where we started). He said he has zero expectations and if it works out great and if it doesn’t then we could be friends. To me that’s neither here nor there, but after this convo I felt relief and like I had more freedom to choose where I want to go. I don’t plan to let him ruin a city for me but I also don’t want to move with expectations of us reuniting.

From what I know- if he wanted to he would. I know Instagram is the worst with comparison but I’ve seen men travel hundreds of miles for a date with a girl they’ve just met on a random vacation. Could this be right person wrong time? Should I let him be? If I move there in the next month given I get hired, should I tell him or let him figure it out and reach out?

I currently work as a contracted security agent in a library located in Quebec.

I have completed a course pertaining to being a security agent (including how to use a fire extinguisher and administer first aid) and hold a Bureau de la Sécurité Privée license.

On Sunday (four days ago) there was a fire in a very small break room that is no more than two meters wall-to-wall and includes a microwave, a sink and a coffee machine.

Someone put a bowl that contained aluminum into the microwave and turned it on; causing a small fire. I was informed of this, went to check it out, went to grab a fire extinguisher, went back and seeing as the fire was growing I used the extinguisher.

Since the room is so small the extinguisher being used caused a lot of blowback that hit my face to the point that I had to stop the usage. I saw the fire was still there so I felt the need to use the extinguisher again and that put out the fire.

I went outside for fresh air and was drinking a lot of liquid and honestly I was feeling fine. Some shortness of breath but overall not bad.

Today (4 days later) I woke up with my chest burning intensely and a severe cough. I thought it was because I slept next to an open window but this feels differrent.

My questions are;

 is there a violation of fire safety codes having a microwave in such a small room?

Is it a workplace hazard for me having to use an extinguisher in such a small room?

I'm looking for compensation because the cough and burning in the chest can be very serious for me - I was a premature birth and my lungs are very weak.

I noticed a sprinkler on the ceiling in that room but it didn't go off which is weird for it being such a small room.



I have pictures of the blowback on my pants + shoes, the extinguisher used and the chemical residue where the microwave was standing.
No pictures of the microwave because they threw it out before I could take one.

Please let me know whether you think I should pursue this or not.

1r9jxgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeniscusInjuries/comments/1r9jxgg/some_recovery_tips_from_my_meniscus_repair_surgery/,Some recovery tips from my meniscus repair surgery,"I'm on week 5 of 6-weeks NWB. Repair of radial tear posterior horn. A few things that helped me, passing it along:

\- Pre-hab was a lifesaver. I was doing strength training, independent muscle activation and mobility in PT (trying to avoid surgery) up until the day before my surgery and it's helped me retain strength, mobility, and really important balance! Like I had zero problems activating my quads, doing straight leg lifts, etc. Which means I will walk sooner than most. Get as fit as you can BEFORE surgery.

\- bathroom setup: tub transfer chair, that spins, toilet seat handle I managed without a riser.

\- take pictures of the brace on your leg from all angles post surgery, so you get the fit properly documented. You'll need to adjust the brace constantly, for swelling, standing, and sitting. Thicker pants, thinner pants, etc. If your not moving you can loosen the straps, my brace had these latches that would get knocked loose that adjusts the lengths so knowing what the right setting for that helps.

\- a tote for carrying things, you won't have full use of both hands. Sports bottles, and coffee thermos for transporting liquids. I also made use of reusable lunch tins for moving food from place to place in my tote.

\- first week my stomach was a mess from the anathesisa and meds. Have on hand: saltines, rice pudding, miso soup, bananas, toast, electrolytes (I love Cure).  When I reintroduced food slowly, the best was a peanut butter and banana grilled sandwich. A favorite of Elvis.

\- stars, I'm on a 3rd floor walkup. Going up on your butt is the easiest. 4 weeks on  (over time the crutches get easier), I realized going up the stairs backwards was easier than hopping up them forward.

\- rent a NIce machine (ask your surgeon about it). Ran that 24/7 cycling 30/30 for the first three weeks. Helped me sleep! It wraps around your knee, so you can wear the brace straps more loosely and still be secured.

\- clear off a bedside table AND bench or chair near your bed, you will be needing space for all your easy access things.

\- sleeping, the brace sucks to sleep in. There's no getting around it. It helped to use a fluffy throw blanket the first few weeks instead of traditional, tucked in, bedsheets and blanket as it helped me adjust and felt looser around my sensitive leg.

\- warm thick soft socks. my surgery foot always got really cold. At night to calm nerves/stress, I would put a heating pad (a hot water bottle would work too) near my cold feet. Making sure to keep the heat far away from the knee, of course. Ankle pumps and toe wiggles help keep the blood flow moving.

\- my calf muscles would cramp at night from the PT, triple magnesium powder (I use the one by Pillar), and Arnica gel worked wonders. I also used Calendula ointment all around my knee (avoiding stitches area) to keep it moisturized.

\- when starting bending in PT it helped to cup my knee with both hands to desensitize it and spread out the sensations.

\- a long handed shoe horn. Makes putting on shoes so much easier. + A long handed back scrubber for your feet. Gotta stay clean! Birkenstocks for the first week, then I was able to wear Adidas Sambas.

\- wrapping my knee in saran wrap was easier than using any weird stuff on amazon for showering. Until you can get it wet.

\- when out and about, pants that aren't slippery help keep the brace in place. Sleek leggings are terrible for this, unless you put the brace on like a tourniquet.

\- if using Uber, etc. The lower the car to the ground the easier it is to get in and out. SUVs that are high off the ground are very hard to get into.

\- I had Mobileg crutches (much more comfortable, but heavier than regular crutches) to use in the apartment and regular ones to use outside (lightweight, but more jittery). If your nwb, European crutches are much riskier to use as you can't really use your hands easily to hang onto things if you lose your balance and you can't use both hands by just resting the crutches on your underarms.

\- I did the bulk of my PT at night, as they are mostly very slow movements and it was a good way to wind down. It's not cardio. Lol.

\- get a pedicure the day before surgery. It's impossibly hard to trim your toe nails the first couple weeks until you get really flexible.

\- get rid of any clutter around your apartment before hand. When you are less mobile all that stuff you can't do will drive you nuts.

\- if you shop at trader joes or any grocery store for that matter, and have someone to shop for you. Taking pictures of your favorite things will help them find it easier in the store. List by Aisle.

That's all I can think of for now. That just helped make life a bit easier. Would love to hear from others as everyone is different!",1,1771556598.0,MeniscusInjuries,0,1.0,False

We’re have 5 of 7 lunches and half way there with dinner - but breakfast is still a challenge! 

So yesterday we had cake for breakfast 🍰 

We’re confident we can get 7 more typical breakfasts, so we’re not adding cake to our official list of 21 meals. But it was so delicious we think it deserves an honorable mention. 

Oshita san is a pioneer of gluten free food in the region. She started her cafe when her grandson was diagnosed with wheat allergy so he could enjoy bread and baked treats. 

This love and care infuses everything about her cafe - from the handmade ceramics cups and plates, to the wooden spoons and the pots of honey from her own bees for sale on the counter. 

Her cafe is at the foot of the Keta Wakamiya Shrine which inspired the shrine in anime Kimi no Nawa (Your Name) and is near the trailhead for the Mt Ambo hike. It’s about a 10 minute walk from Hida Furukawa Ststion. 

Stay tuned. I’m posting these meals here first and will keep you all in the loop. 

If all goes well - the final map and travel tools will be finished in time for the Hida Furukawa Festival April 19-20.

Books, research, podcasts, watching hundreds of hours of the most magnetic people in interviews. Not because I wanted to manipulate anyone, but because I was tired of watching genuinely good people get overlooked while smooth talkers got everything.

Here's what nobody tells you: charm isn't about being the loudest or funniest. It's a learnable skill that has more to do with making others feel good than making yourself look good. Sounds simple but most people get this backwards their entire lives.

**1. master the art of making people feel seen**

This is the foundation everything else builds on. Charismatic people make you feel like you're the only person in the room. Not through some manipulative trick but through genuine attention.

When someone's talking, put your phone away. Actually away, not face down on the table where you can see it light up. Make eye contact but don't stare like a serial killer. Nod at appropriate moments. Ask follow up questions that show you were actually listening.

""[The Charisma Myth](https://a.co/d/01UXzuAZ)"" by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks this down scientifically. She's a lecturer at Stanford and Berkeley who's coached everyone from executives to military leaders. The book explains how presence, power and warmth create charisma, and most importantly, that it's completely trainable. This book genuinely changed how i interact with people. Easily the best charisma book you'll find.

Here's the thing though. You can't fake presence. People can smell bullshit from a mile away. Which brings me to the next point.

**2. be actually interested, not just interesting**

Most people approach conversations thinking ""what can i say to impress them?"" Wrong game entirely.

Flip it. Think ""what can i learn from this person?"" Everyone, and i mean everyone, has something interesting about them. The barista might have toured europe. Your coworker might breed rare fish. You won't know unless you ask.

Dale Carnegie figured this out almost a century ago in ""[How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://a.co/d/0apEAG5C)"". Yeah it's old but human nature hasn't changed. Carnegie was a pioneer in interpersonal skills and this book sold over 30 million copies for a reason. The core message: people love talking about themselves and will like you more if you let them. Insanely good read that holds up perfectly today.

Practical tip: use the FORD method (family, occupation, recreation, dreams). Way better than weather talk. ""What do you do for fun?"" opens more doors than ""crazy weather right?""

**3. develop conversational calibration**

This is about reading the room and adjusting your energy accordingly. Charismatic people are social chameleons but not in a fake way. They match energy levels appropriately.

Funeral? Dial it down. Party? Bring energy up. One on one coffee? More intimate tone. Seems obvious but you'd be amazed how many people blast the same energy level everywhere.

Also learn when to talk and when to shut up. Seriously. Some people think charm means constant talking. Nah. Strategic silence creates space for others and makes your words carry more weight when you do speak.

The Huberman Lab podcast has an episode on social connection and bonding that explains the neuroscience behind this. Andrew Huberman is a stanford neuroscientist and his podcast is incredible for understanding how our brains actually work in social situations. He breaks down things like eye contact duration, vocal tonality, and synchronization between people.

**4. master the subtle art of validation**

People are walking around starving for validation. Not fake compliments but genuine recognition.

Notice specific things. ""You always remember everyone's coffee order, that's actually really thoughtful"" hits different than ""you're nice."" Be specific. Specific compliments show you're paying attention.

But here's the catch, never compliment to get something. People sense transactional energy instantly. Compliment because you genuinely noticed something worth acknowledging.

For deeper learning on social dynamics, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), a personalized learning app built by Columbia University alumni. Type in what you want to work on, like ""become more charismatic in professional settings"" or ""improve my conversation skills as an introvert,"" and it builds a structured learning plan pulling from communication books, social psychology research, and expert interviews. You control the depth, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, like choosing a warm conversational tone or something more energetic. Makes absorbing this kind of material way more natural than forcing yourself through dense books when you're tired.

**5. develop genuine confidence (the unsexy way)**

You can't charm anyone if you're constantly worried about what they think of you. Confidence comes from competence. You build competence through repeated action.

Wanna be confident socially? Talk to more people. There's no shortcut. Start small. Cashiers, uber drivers, people in elevators. Build up tolerance.

Mark Manson's ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck"" nails this. He's sold over 10 million copies by basically saying stop trying to be positive all the time and focus on what actually matters to you. When you stop desperately seeking everyone's approval, you become naturally more magnetic. This book will make you question everything you think you know about self improvement.

**6. learn to tell stories properly**

Charismatic people are good storytellers. Not because they live interesting lives but because they structure experiences in engaging ways.

Keep stories concise. Have a point. Use specific details that paint pictures. ""We went to a restaurant"" versus ""we went to this tiny ramen place in the basement of an office building."" See the difference?

Also learn to laugh at yourself. Self deprecating humor (in moderation) makes you relatable and shows confidence. Just don't overdo it or you seem insecure.

**7. develop warmth alongside competence**

Research shows people judge you on two dimensions immediately: warmth and competence. You need both but warmth should come first.

Smile genuinely (fake smiles use different muscles, people notice). Use people's names in conversation. Have open body language. Uncross those arms. Face people directly when talking.

But balance warmth with competence. You don't want to seem like a pushover. Have opinions. Disagree respectfully when appropriate. Spineless agreement isn't charming, it's boring.

**8. practice radical authenticity**

Here's the paradox. The more you try to be charming, the less charming you become. People can sense try-hards instantly.

The most magnetic people are unapologetically themselves. They have quirks and don't hide them. They admit when they don't know something. They're not performing, they're just being.

This doesn't mean be an asshole and call it authenticity. It means don't pretend to like jazz if you hate jazz. Don't laugh at jokes you don't find funny. People respect and are drawn to realness.

Start by being more honest in low stakes situations. ""Actually i haven't seen that show"" instead of nodding along. Small authenticity builds to bigger authenticity.

The bottom line is charm isn't manipulation. It's making people feel valued, heard and comfortable. When you genuinely care about others' experiences and stop obsessing over your own image, charm happens naturally.

Takes practice though. Lots of it. You'll mess up conversations. Say awkward things. Misread situations. That's fine. Every charismatic person you admire has bombed countless interactions. They just kept going.",1,1771556131.0,Menscomeback,0,1.0,False
1r9jpmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1r9jpmq/what_love_is_to_me/,"What love is, to me.","Disclaimer: I am no expert, this is just what I think love is.

- - - 

Love is not exciting. It is not a roller coaster of emotions, not knowing quite where you will go. It is not anxious feelings, and quiet regret. It is most importantly, not loud. 

Love is the steady heartbeat you have in their presence. It is knowing where you stand, and never wavering in the knowledge that without a doubt they'd be at your side the moment something was wrong. It is the reassurance when things feel a little heavy, without having to ask. It is the consideration in quiet gestures, a coffee in the morning or chocolate just because. 

Love is hard conversations but knowing it'll be okay because you have faith in both your abilities to handle each other's emotions. That is because neither of you are afraid by the others inner feelings and demons. It is playfulness, and laughter. 

Love, can be lonely. There are moments that need silence, distance and trusting that that is simply because the other person needs it, and they trust you enough to give it. Love is complex by nature, but in reality roots itself in kindness, consideration and softness. 

Above all, love is still. The world around you becomes quiet, and nothing seems too big to accomplish knowing they'll be by your side. It is being grateful for the small moments of being noticed, and knowing that youve never been seen before like how they see you. When their eyes meets yours, they do not see the mask, who you pretend to be amongst the sea of people. They see you. They see your flaws, your fears, your likes, your ambitions, your demons and they say your depths doesnt scare them. They see what makes you special to them, and you know that in their arms, you are home. ",4,1771555999.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

Screens still kind of bother me. I have to keep the brightness setting pretty low, but it’s nowhere near as bad as it was.

See, I’m nearsighted, and my morning routine is usually to put on music, wash my face, then pop in my contacts. But I have a bad habit of not putting them in right away. I usually end up watching a quick video, or a particular story catches my attention just long enough to make me forget what I was doing.

This time I was flicking through music, just trying to get the right jam to help me start my day.

When I reached for my contacts, I felt something lightly tap my hand along with the sound of a soft “click.”

A fly — a big one, too. It had bumped into me, apparently having landed near my contacts and taking off just as I reached for my first lens. The thing buzzed around my head, then took to circling the room before eventually finding its way out the open window. It still managed to smack into the glass a couple of times before figuring it out.

I didn’t think anything of it. Who would? Flies were everywhere down here in the summer, the heat making their numbers swell in disgusting quantities. Maybe it was the fly. They say it’s more likely I just didn’t keep the area clean — maybe didn’t wash my hands. No real way to tell at this point, but they say the timeline matches up. After that, it was business as usual for the rest of the day.

It was two days later when the problems started. I woke up to red, itchy eyes reflected back at me from my phone screen. There was a sensation like grit, like I’d managed to get dust or sand lodged under my eyelids, and no matter how much I rubbed, it just wouldn’t come out. Eye drops helped ease things a little, but it never really stopped. My eyes got so red that I started to worry people would think I’d been crying. Even in the office, I found it hard to focus on my monitor. I tried reading through the latest email HR had sent out about some new dress code policies when I felt a dull ache start to form at the back of my eyes — a not-too-unfamiliar pressure building.

Fantastic. I was getting another migraine.

The pain only softened when I closed them, darkness soothing the ache but not the itch. When I cracked them open again, the world started to blur. Light sensitivity was nothing new for me during these migraines, but this one seemed to come on more suddenly. I lowered the brightness on my monitor, opened my desk drawer to pull out some off-brand aspirin, and tried to power through the day until I could get home to a dark room.

By the end of it, my head was pounding. Every light I passed caused a little more pain, like I’d been staring into the sun. The drive home was awful. I already hated the people who passed me on my way home every night, but this made me start contemplating whether it was legal to bust out headlights in self-defense. I live a little ways out of town, and the roads get dark at night. More than one idiot out there had decided regular headlamps weren’t good enough. No — they needed blinding white headlamps and light bars, which meant every new driver caused a wave of pounding pain to hit me in the temples and make my head feel ready to pop. I don’t know how I made it home with half the drive spent squinting, trying to avoid another flashbang. It felt like heaven to collapse into a warm bath with the lights off — the usual trick for soothing my migraines. Dipping my head under the hot, lavender-scented water was the only real relief I’d gotten all day.

I managed to fall asleep pretty easily after that, tired from work, head pain, and the relaxation from the hot water. I woke up the next day mostly better. It wasn’t unusual for these migraines to last a day or two, and I was just thankful this one seemed to be tapering off. My eyes still itched, but the severity was down. Instead of the puffy red mess they’d been before, they now just had an unhealthy pink tinge from residual irritation.

I chalked it up to allergies. I’ve always had bad issues with pollen, and the symptoms matched — aside from the lack of a runny nose. The only thing really odd at that point was that certain lights bothered me more than others.

Monitors, cellphone screens, and headlamps all seemed brighter — but sunlight didn’t. I stood outside on a bright afternoon and felt perfectly fine until I heard a ping from my pocket and tried to check a text from my boss. So I started avoiding screens as best I could. Not easy working an office job, but I managed. Every time an office coffee run needed to be done, I was there. Needed to answer calls? Better than trying to read emails, and most of what I did was just take notes for clients anyway. The boss didn’t care if they were on paper as long as he got them.

I started leaving on my breaks. I’d drive ten minutes out to the edge of town and just sit in my car. The warm sun felt nice on my skin, and the colors of the wildflowers seemed more vibrant than usual. Purples and reds popped. Greens seemed deeper. I’d never really noticed red flowers around here before. Even the tree trunks seemed more colorful — more alive.

I still remember running my hands along the trunk of a big, beautiful tree, soaking in the feeling of sun-warmed bark on my palm.

It was nice. The pressure in my eyes would dull. Away from the noise and light I’d been slogging through, I could just take in the sights. But I’ll admit — all that time near the outdoors made the city feel worse by comparison. The red brick buildings I passed every day seemed washed out compared to the wildflowers. The gray sidewalks looked duller and more worn each time I noticed them. The only things that still seemed to pop were the traffic signs. It was like they’d been polished — stop signs a fire-engine red, street signs a vibrant green against the gray.

The rides home became a mixed blessing. The woods — even at night, especially at night — looked better than I remembered. Leaves rustled in the breeze. The air smelled clean. Wind brushed against my skin. I started rolling the windows down and cruising instead of rushing home to fit in a show or game before bed.

I was still taking eye drops. Everything was in bloom, and I figured pollen was the culprit. I also assumed I was noticing my floaters more because I’d been obsessing over my vision. It felt like they’d moved — no longer limp stringy lines near the center of my vision, but faint wavy lines near the periphery.

They kept making me think I was seeing something out of the corner of my eye during my walks. I never really panicked. I’d assume it was a squirrel or a shift in the brush until I focused and saw the slow drift of those damn floaters.

Looking back, I don’t remember my eyes itching on those walks at all. I’d just wander down the vague path that was starting to form.

Eventually work started piling up. I had a backlog of client questions and calls I’d been putting off. Normally I’d have things like that done already, but I’d been busy “helping” in ways that got me out of the office. The boss started sending vague emails about productivity. I finally put in for a half day to see a doctor, and thankfully it was approved.

“Good news — it’s probably nothing serious.” His tone was always flat, which I liked. It felt less performative.

He had me look into a light to test my pupils and muttered something about sluggish response but said irritation could cause that.

“Probably just allergies. Maybe pink eye if we’re unlucky. As for the light sensitivity, it’s likely a bad migraine. Are you taking your medications?”

Of course I was. I’d been taking the same handful of vitamins and prescriptions for years. He pulled down my eyelids and had me look up.

“You’ve got a small conjunctival concretion — not dangerous. Probably unrelated to your symptoms.”

He clicked off his light, prescribed stronger drops, and told me to call if it didn’t improve in a week.

They helped. The gritty feeling eased, and I managed to sleep. The next morning I felt decent — still exhausted, but better. I even cleared a few dozen emails.

Then the following morning I opened my phone and felt a soft pang of eye strain creeping back in. No big deal. Probably still healing. But by the time I was dressed and out the door, I could feel it.

That rough, almost hair-like itch.

He couldn’t chew me out — I’d been bringing him his favorite coffee every other day. Tiffany in the next cubicle said I looked tired. Said I’d been jumpy. I blamed allergies and waved her off.

Sleep became harder to find. I could only rest if I took a short loop through the woods first. Normally I’d never walk through brush at night, but the moonlight seemed bright enough lately, giving everything a silvery sheen. I even spotted a few fireflies. I’d never seen them around here before. Movies don’t do them justice — it wasn’t yellow so much as a faint white glow fading in and out.

I’d take out my phone and snap a few pictures of the scenery, but every one — aside from killing my eyes with the flash — came out wrong. Like some kind of filter had toned everything down. I couldn’t see the flowers, and the fireflies just looked like white dots. I figured it was because the phone was old and probably not great at night photos. Eventually I stopped bringing it. All it did was ruin the silence with a notification or make my eyes hurt when I checked a text.

After that, the irritation gradually came back. Every minute in my chair became more uncomfortable. Eventually I was going to the bathroom every other hour — part to apply eye drops, part to get a break from the glow of my monitor.

I remember standing in front of the mirror, pulling down my lower eyelid to study the inflamed red lines cracking through the pink-white of my eye. I even wondered if it was the tiny white dots near the bottom — what the doctor had called a concretion — maybe they were pushing outward from inside my lid.

I tried gently prodding one with a fingertip.

It felt like it shifted.

Like it receded.

I think people started suspecting something. Conversations got shorter. They began using the water cooler on the opposite side of the building, keeping their distance.

It didn’t help that I was starting to lose focus. I think the lack of sleep was getting to me. I kept catching myself standing near the window, zoning out while looking toward the treeline in the distance.

I got drug tested that week. Came back clean obviously. They said it was random, but I know that’s a lie.

I drifted through the rest of the week, productivity dropping and emails from my manager becoming less routine and more passive-aggressive. The issues with light were getting worse. I started driving earlier in the morning and later at night just to avoid traffic. The exhaustion must’ve been getting to me because I could’ve sworn the office plant in the corner had never bloomed before, but now it clearly had patches of red.

Even my walks weren’t doing me much good. Whenever I hit the end of my little path and turned around, all the tension and discomfort would ratchet back up with every step towards home. The moonlight would feel dimmer, and it started taking me longer and longer to get back and into bed. Three days or so after my checkup, I was walking deeper in than usual, just letting my legs carry me with the hope I'd wear myself out enough to get some decent sleep. I’d unintentionally made a little trail through the brush, which just made it easier to lose myself to the motion of one foot in front of the other.

I still remember rounding that kind of bent tree, stopping, and taking a deep breath. Just letting the moment pass and enjoying the earthy smell of damp soil and the tranquility of it all. When I opened my eyes again, I saw something I still have some trouble really describing.

The woods were quiet, far enough from the road that there wasn’t even the occasional whoosh of a car breaking the peace. At first I thought maybe I’d stumbled across someone else on a walk when I saw the white dot. Figured it was a flashlight.

Then it winked out, causing me to stop mid-stride.

A soft glow, a little further off now. Bright enough to make the moonlight look dim. It was beautiful, if confusing. The closest thing I could compare it to would be a halo radiating colors in faint swirling motions.

It dimmed… then brightened again, further off. Something about it made everything else fade away, like seeing the stars for the first time.

Could fireflies do that? Was this why people always acted like they were such a big deal? I tried to get closer, but it seemed to have just disappeared. Standing there, trying to puzzle it out, something hit me.

My eyes didn’t hurt. For the first time in days, they actually felt…

Normal.

Then it bloomed again — a soft glow to my left — and I found myself shifting, walking toward it. I walked softly, trying not to scare it away so I could get a closer look. And that’s how the rest of my walk went.

It would fade and leave me in darkness, then somewhere off ahead it would brighten again — and I’d follow.

I only realized I was lost when the sun started to rise. I was in a part of the woods I’d never gone to before, standing in front of a rather large tree. Not giant, but definitely older than the trees around it. It seemed lush — a small oasis of light in the middle of a thicker patch of woods.

That wasn't what stood out though.

The tree was covered in softly glowing light. I’d finally gotten close enough that I noticed the buzzing — the space was filled with it. A louder buzz zipped past my ear, making me turn to watch the dim-glowing ball of light land on a nearby bush.

The glow swelled, then dimmed — thin streaks of red and yellow bleeding away with the light until—

All I could see was the shape of a plump black fly.

It sat there, rubbing its little legs together.

I’d expected something lithe, something delicate — maybe with a bulb-lit abdomen — not something that looked so much like the same pests I’d been dealing with all summer.

A few still glowed, buzzing and landing here and there, but as sunlight filtered through the trees the orbs winked out one by one, leaving behind patches of tiny, erratically moving black specks.

The tree that, in the dark, I’d mistaken for something beautiful now showed its truth — bark rotted away in wide patches, its trunk pitted and raw. It was bare of leaves. Only the surrounding trees had lent it that illusion in the dim light of night.

The pressure building behind my eyes snapped me back. My vision blurred, even as I squinted tight, trying to force it into focus.

It wasn’t like the headaches.

It was worse.

It felt like something was pressing in from the edges of my skull, forcing my eyes forward, making them shift in their sockets.

Blinking hurt, the gritty feeling I’d been dealing with now something closer to pinpricks that punished every attempt to squeeze my eyelids shut. I would instinctively squint, only to be immediately forced to open them wide again from the sharp stabbing sensation.

I barely noticed the tears hitting my cheeks — warm liquid running down my chilled skin.

I slid my hand down my face, mostly just succeeding in smearing my tears across my skin.

Then I felt a tingle on my palm — it almost tickled. Something shifted, and I just figured I’d grabbed a fly somehow — they seemed to be everywhere now. Buzzing that had been a dull background drone earlier was suddenly much louder.

When one smacked me in the forehead, I noticed how many were landing on me. They crawled from my arm toward the hand I’d used to wipe my face — and, judging by the tickle on my forehead, down my cheeks as well.

I even had to flick a few of the braver ones away from my eyes as their little feet scurried down my brow.

I flicked and shook my arm, but they were persistent. Even as I backed away, the little bastards kept smacking into me in their attempts to roost.

Something forced me to blink — a fly nearly flying directly into my left eye. The pain made me gasp, and the sensation of something hitting the back of my throat — something I could feel buzzing — sent me into a coughing fit, lurching forward and putting my hands on my knees to brace myself.

I was leaning over, staring at the ground.

At a black shape — thin, but taking up a good chunk of the vision in my left eye.

The thought of a fly’s leg came to mind, and the thought made me retch.

Sitting there in the center of my left eye’s vision was a crooked black line — one that I delicately reached up to wipe away.

Only for it to squirm, shifting in a jerking motion, left and then right until seemingly swimming out of sight.

The realization hit me — the sensation of movement had never really stopped. Not the feeling of tiny feet, but something wetter. Smoother.

And it was getting worse.

I brought my fingertips to the wet feeling on my cheek, and they came away sticky, covered in something tacky with little chunks of white — what I’d thought were just the tears that had dripped down my face and chin. It tasted bitter, and when something wriggled on my tongue, I couldn’t hold it in anymore.

I dropped to my hands and knees, vomit hitting the forest floor and immediately becoming swarmed with crawling, buzzing life. A few faint flickers of light in the shade above my prone body — the only thing breaking up the scene.

With shaking hands I found a nearby tree, the blurring of my vision growing worse by the second. I dug my fingers into the rough bark and managed to haul myself up onto my feet.

I leaned there, trying to spit out the last bit of acid that was burning the back of my throat and tried to focus.

At the time, I thought it was just because I’d held my eyes open so long. Although even after I managed to close them without feeling like I’d slice them open, my vision didn’t refocus.

The forest was nothing more than loosely defined shapes, like I was looking through a pair of glasses that weren’t made for me.

I stumbled away from the big tree, slapping at every feeling of something brushing or moving on my bare skin. I thought that if I just went the opposite direction of it, I’d hopefully be walking back roughly the way I came.

It wasn’t long before it started to get dark, and I had to push down the rising panic. It was early morning — the sun was high in the sky.

My light jog turned into a slow walk after bumping into my first bush, then a slow sliding shuffle after bumping into a log.

After a while, all I could see was darkness.

At some point I heard a light rumble in the distance, which rapidly passed me by with an obnoxious honk blaring off into the distance.

I tapped my foot against the ground — solid. I’d found the road.

Somebody eventually stopped for me, thank God, and got me to a hospital. By the time they actually took me in, my vision was already returning.

The guy who picked me up hadn’t stayed around, but according to somebody who’d been waiting next to me, my eyes were “milk white” when I walked in.

They said I had something called corneal edema. Apparently all the irritation I’d been experiencing lately could make your corneas swell and block out light.

But I don’t think that’s right.

When I got home and started looking over the cuts and bruises I’d gotten, I noticed something small and white on the sleeve of my shirt.

I tried to gently pick it up with my fingertip but only managed to smear it into the fiber of my shirt.

My finger came back with a familiar tacky sensation.",2,1771555251.0,u_Opposite-Action-9994,0,1.0,False

I just started building.
Late nights. Headphones on. Coffee next to me. Hours passing without me noticing.
It became a hobby really fast, not because I had to do it, but because I wanted to. There’s something addictive about turning an idea in your head into something real you can click, use, and improve.
I’m not some big technical expert. I just got obsessed with creating tools that solved problems I personally had. So I built apps that I actually use myself. Tools that feel meaningful to me. Things that make my workflow smoother, my thinking clearer, my projects more organized.
And the crazy part? I love using the things I build.
For months I was just building in my own bubble. I didn’t even realize communities like Reddit existed where people share, build, test, give feedback, and support each other.
Now I feel like I’ve been coding in my room with the lights off… and suddenly I opened the door.
So here I am.
I want to share what I’ve been building. I want feedback. I want to learn. I want to see what other people are making. And maybe, if someone out there finds one of my tools useful, that would honestly mean everything.

1r9jfwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1r9jfwt/i_thought_it_was_just_another_migraine_i_was_wrong/,I Thought It Was Just Another Migraine. I Was Wrong.,"It started around the first of the month. With my contacts, I think. That’s what they tell me anyway.

Screens still kind of bother me. I have to keep the brightness setting pretty low, but it’s nowhere near as bad as it was.

See, I’m nearsighted, and my morning routine is usually to put on music, wash my face, then pop in my contacts. But I have a bad habit of not putting them in right away. I usually end up watching a quick video, or a particular story catches my attention just long enough to make me forget what I was doing.

This time I was flicking through music, just trying to get the right jam to help me start my day.

When I reached for my contacts, I felt something lightly tap my hand along with the sound of a soft “click.”

A fly — a big one, too. It had bumped into me, apparently having landed near my contacts and taking off just as I reached for my first lens. The thing buzzed around my head, then took to circling the room before eventually finding its way out the open window. It still managed to smack into the glass a couple of times before figuring it out.

I didn’t think anything of it. Who would? Flies were everywhere down here in the summer, the heat making their numbers swell in disgusting quantities. Maybe it was the fly. They say it’s more likely I just didn’t keep the area clean — maybe didn’t wash my hands. No real way to tell at this point, but they say the timeline matches up. After that, it was business as usual for the rest of the day.

It was two days later when the problems started. I woke up to red, itchy eyes reflected back at me from my phone screen. There was a sensation like grit, like I’d managed to get dust or sand lodged under my eyelids, and no matter how much I rubbed, it just wouldn’t come out. Eye drops helped ease things a little, but it never really stopped. My eyes got so red that I started to worry people would think I’d been crying. Even in the office, I found it hard to focus on my monitor. I tried reading through the latest email HR had sent out about some new dress code policies when I felt a dull ache start to form at the back of my eyes — a not-too-unfamiliar pressure building.

Fantastic. I was getting another migraine.

The pain only softened when I closed them, darkness soothing the ache but not the itch. When I cracked them open again, the world started to blur. Light sensitivity was nothing new for me during these migraines, but this one seemed to come on more suddenly. I lowered the brightness on my monitor, opened my desk drawer to pull out some off-brand aspirin, and tried to power through the day until I could get home to a dark room.

By the end of it, my head was pounding. Every light I passed caused a little more pain, like I’d been staring into the sun. The drive home was awful. I already hated the people who passed me on my way home every night, but this made me start contemplating whether it was legal to bust out headlights in self-defense. I live a little ways out of town, and the roads get dark at night. More than one idiot out there had decided regular headlamps weren’t good enough. No — they needed blinding white headlamps and light bars, which meant every new driver caused a wave of pounding pain to hit me in the temples and make my head feel ready to pop. I don’t know how I made it home with half the drive spent squinting, trying to avoid another flashbang. It felt like heaven to collapse into a warm bath with the lights off — the usual trick for soothing my migraines. Dipping my head under the hot, lavender-scented water was the only real relief I’d gotten all day.

I managed to fall asleep pretty easily after that, tired from work, head pain, and the relaxation from the hot water. I woke up the next day mostly better. It wasn’t unusual for these migraines to last a day or two, and I was just thankful this one seemed to be tapering off. My eyes still itched, but the severity was down. Instead of the puffy red mess they’d been before, they now just had an unhealthy pink tinge from residual irritation.

I chalked it up to allergies. I’ve always had bad issues with pollen, and the symptoms matched — aside from the lack of a runny nose. The only thing really odd at that point was that certain lights bothered me more than others.

Monitors, cellphone screens, and headlamps all seemed brighter — but sunlight didn’t. I stood outside on a bright afternoon and felt perfectly fine until I heard a ping from my pocket and tried to check a text from my boss. So I started avoiding screens as best I could. Not easy working an office job, but I managed. Every time an office coffee run needed to be done, I was there. Needed to answer calls? Better than trying to read emails, and most of what I did was just take notes for clients anyway. The boss didn’t care if they were on paper as long as he got them.

I started leaving on my breaks. I’d drive ten minutes out to the edge of town and just sit in my car. The warm sun felt nice on my skin, and the colors of the wildflowers seemed more vibrant than usual. Purples and reds popped. Greens seemed deeper. I’d never really noticed red flowers around here before. Even the tree trunks seemed more colorful — more alive.

I still remember running my hands along the trunk of a big, beautiful tree, soaking in the feeling of sun-warmed bark on my palm.

It was nice. The pressure in my eyes would dull. Away from the noise and light I’d been slogging through, I could just take in the sights. But I’ll admit — all that time near the outdoors made the city feel worse by comparison. The red brick buildings I passed every day seemed washed out compared to the wildflowers. The gray sidewalks looked duller and more worn each time I noticed them. The only things that still seemed to pop were the traffic signs. It was like they’d been polished — stop signs a fire-engine red, street signs a vibrant green against the gray.

The rides home became a mixed blessing. The woods — even at night, especially at night — looked better than I remembered. Leaves rustled in the breeze. The air smelled clean. Wind brushed against my skin. I started rolling the windows down and cruising instead of rushing home to fit in a show or game before bed.

I was still taking eye drops. Everything was in bloom, and I figured pollen was the culprit. I also assumed I was noticing my floaters more because I’d been obsessing over my vision. It felt like they’d moved — no longer limp stringy lines near the center of my vision, but faint wavy lines near the periphery.

They kept making me think I was seeing something out of the corner of my eye during my walks. I never really panicked. I’d assume it was a squirrel or a shift in the brush until I focused and saw the slow drift of those damn floaters.

Looking back, I don’t remember my eyes itching on those walks at all. I’d just wander down the vague path that was starting to form.

Eventually work started piling up. I had a backlog of client questions and calls I’d been putting off. Normally I’d have things like that done already, but I’d been busy “helping” in ways that got me out of the office. The boss started sending vague emails about productivity. I finally put in for a half day to see a doctor, and thankfully it was approved.

“Good news — it’s probably nothing serious.” His tone was always flat, which I liked. It felt less performative.

He had me look into a light to test my pupils and muttered something about sluggish response but said irritation could cause that.

“Probably just allergies. Maybe pink eye if we’re unlucky. As for the light sensitivity, it’s likely a bad migraine. Are you taking your medications?”

Of course I was. I’d been taking the same handful of vitamins and prescriptions for years. He pulled down my eyelids and had me look up.

“You’ve got a small conjunctival concretion — not dangerous. Probably unrelated to your symptoms.”

He clicked off his light, prescribed stronger drops, and told me to call if it didn’t improve in a week.

They helped. The gritty feeling eased, and I managed to sleep. The next morning I felt decent — still exhausted, but better. I even cleared a few dozen emails.

Then the following morning I opened my phone and felt a soft pang of eye strain creeping back in. No big deal. Probably still healing. But by the time I was dressed and out the door, I could feel it.

That rough, almost hair-like itch.

He couldn’t chew me out — I’d been bringing him his favorite coffee every other day. Tiffany in the next cubicle said I looked tired. Said I’d been jumpy. I blamed allergies and waved her off.

Sleep became harder to find. I could only rest if I took a short loop through the woods first. Normally I’d never walk through brush at night, but the moonlight seemed bright enough lately, giving everything a silvery sheen. I even spotted a few fireflies. I’d never seen them around here before. Movies don’t do them justice — it wasn’t yellow so much as a faint white glow fading in and out.

I’d take out my phone and snap a few pictures of the scenery, but every one — aside from killing my eyes with the flash — came out wrong. Like some kind of filter had toned everything down. I couldn’t see the flowers, and the fireflies just looked like white dots. I figured it was because the phone was old and probably not great at night photos. Eventually I stopped bringing it. All it did was ruin the silence with a notification or make my eyes hurt when I checked a text.

After that, the irritation gradually came back. Every minute in my chair became more uncomfortable. Eventually I was going to the bathroom every other hour — part to apply eye drops, part to get a break from the glow of my monitor.

I remember standing in front of the mirror, pulling down my lower eyelid to study the inflamed red lines cracking through the pink-white of my eye. I even wondered if it was the tiny white dots near the bottom — what the doctor had called a concretion — maybe they were pushing outward from inside my lid.

I tried gently prodding one with a fingertip.

It felt like it shifted.

Like it receded.

I think people started suspecting something. Conversations got shorter. They began using the water cooler on the opposite side of the building, keeping their distance.

It didn’t help that I was starting to lose focus. I think the lack of sleep was getting to me. I kept catching myself standing near the window, zoning out while looking toward the treeline in the distance.

I got drug tested that week. Came back clean obviously. They said it was random, but I know that’s a lie.

I drifted through the rest of the week, productivity dropping and emails from my manager becoming less routine and more passive-aggressive. The issues with light were getting worse. I started driving earlier in the morning and later at night just to avoid traffic. The exhaustion must’ve been getting to me because I could’ve sworn the office plant in the corner had never bloomed before, but now it clearly had patches of red.

Even my walks weren’t doing me much good. Whenever I hit the end of my little path and turned around, all the tension and discomfort would ratchet back up with every step towards home. The moonlight would feel dimmer, and it started taking me longer and longer to get back and into bed. Three days or so after my checkup, I was walking deeper in than usual, just letting my legs carry me with the hope I'd wear myself out enough to get some decent sleep. I’d unintentionally made a little trail through the brush, which just made it easier to lose myself to the motion of one foot in front of the other.

I still remember rounding that kind of bent tree, stopping, and taking a deep breath. Just letting the moment pass and enjoying the earthy smell of damp soil and the tranquility of it all. When I opened my eyes again, I saw something I still have some trouble really describing.

The woods were quiet, far enough from the road that there wasn’t even the occasional whoosh of a car breaking the peace. At first I thought maybe I’d stumbled across someone else on a walk when I saw the white dot. Figured it was a flashlight.

Then it winked out, causing me to stop mid-stride.

A soft glow, a little further off now. Bright enough to make the moonlight look dim. It was beautiful, if confusing. The closest thing I could compare it to would be a halo radiating colors in faint swirling motions.

It dimmed… then brightened again, further off. Something about it made everything else fade away, like seeing the stars for the first time.

Could fireflies do that? Was this why people always acted like they were such a big deal? I tried to get closer, but it seemed to have just disappeared. Standing there, trying to puzzle it out, something hit me.

My eyes didn’t hurt. For the first time in days, they actually felt…

Normal.

Then it bloomed again — a soft glow to my left — and I found myself shifting, walking toward it. I walked softly, trying not to scare it away so I could get a closer look. And that’s how the rest of my walk went.

It would fade and leave me in darkness, then somewhere off ahead it would brighten again — and I’d follow.

I only realized I was lost when the sun started to rise. I was in a part of the woods I’d never gone to before, standing in front of a rather large tree. Not giant, but definitely older than the trees around it. It seemed lush — a small oasis of light in the middle of a thicker patch of woods.

That wasn't what stood out though.

The tree was covered in softly glowing light. I’d finally gotten close enough that I noticed the buzzing — the space was filled with it. A louder buzz zipped past my ear, making me turn to watch the dim-glowing ball of light land on a nearby bush.

The glow swelled, then dimmed — thin streaks of red and yellow bleeding away with the light until—

All I could see was the shape of a plump black fly.

It sat there, rubbing its little legs together.

I’d expected something lithe, something delicate — maybe with a bulb-lit abdomen — not something that looked so much like the same pests I’d been dealing with all summer.

A few still glowed, buzzing and landing here and there, but as sunlight filtered through the trees the orbs winked out one by one, leaving behind patches of tiny, erratically moving black specks.

The tree that, in the dark, I’d mistaken for something beautiful now showed its truth — bark rotted away in wide patches, its trunk pitted and raw. It was bare of leaves. Only the surrounding trees had lent it that illusion in the dim light of night.

The pressure building behind my eyes snapped me back. My vision blurred, even as I squinted tight, trying to force it into focus.

It wasn’t like the headaches.

It was worse.

It felt like something was pressing in from the edges of my skull, forcing my eyes forward, making them shift in their sockets.

Blinking hurt, the gritty feeling I’d been dealing with now something closer to pinpricks that punished every attempt to squeeze my eyelids shut. I would instinctively squint, only to be immediately forced to open them wide again from the sharp stabbing sensation.

I barely noticed the tears hitting my cheeks — warm liquid running down my chilled skin.

I slid my hand down my face, mostly just succeeding in smearing my tears across my skin.

Then I felt a tingle on my palm — it almost tickled. Something shifted, and I just figured I’d grabbed a fly somehow — they seemed to be everywhere now. Buzzing that had been a dull background drone earlier was suddenly much louder.

When one smacked me in the forehead, I noticed how many were landing on me. They crawled from my arm toward the hand I’d used to wipe my face — and, judging by the tickle on my forehead, down my cheeks as well.

I even had to flick a few of the braver ones away from my eyes as their little feet scurried down my brow.

I flicked and shook my arm, but they were persistent. Even as I backed away, the little bastards kept smacking into me in their attempts to roost.

Something forced me to blink — a fly nearly flying directly into my left eye. The pain made me gasp, and the sensation of something hitting the back of my throat — something I could feel buzzing — sent me into a coughing fit, lurching forward and putting my hands on my knees to brace myself.

I was leaning over, staring at the ground.

At a black shape — thin, but taking up a good chunk of the vision in my left eye.

The thought of a fly’s leg came to mind, and the thought made me retch.

Sitting there in the center of my left eye’s vision was a crooked black line — one that I delicately reached up to wipe away.

Only for it to squirm, shifting in a jerking motion, left and then right until seemingly swimming out of sight.

The realization hit me — the sensation of movement had never really stopped. Not the feeling of tiny feet, but something wetter. Smoother.

And it was getting worse.

I brought my fingertips to the wet feeling on my cheek, and they came away sticky, covered in something tacky with little chunks of white — what I’d thought were just the tears that had dripped down my face and chin. It tasted bitter, and when something wriggled on my tongue, I couldn’t hold it in anymore.

I dropped to my hands and knees, vomit hitting the forest floor and immediately becoming swarmed with crawling, buzzing life. A few faint flickers of light in the shade above my prone body — the only thing breaking up the scene.

With shaking hands I found a nearby tree, the blurring of my vision growing worse by the second. I dug my fingers into the rough bark and managed to haul myself up onto my feet.

I leaned there, trying to spit out the last bit of acid that was burning the back of my throat and tried to focus.

At the time, I thought it was just because I’d held my eyes open so long. Although even after I managed to close them without feeling like I’d slice them open, my vision didn’t refocus.

The forest was nothing more than loosely defined shapes, like I was looking through a pair of glasses that weren’t made for me.

I stumbled away from the big tree, slapping at every feeling of something brushing or moving on my bare skin. I thought that if I just went the opposite direction of it, I’d hopefully be walking back roughly the way I came.

It wasn’t long before it started to get dark, and I had to push down the rising panic. It was early morning — the sun was high in the sky.

My light jog turned into a slow walk after bumping into my first bush, then a slow sliding shuffle after bumping into a log.

After a while, all I could see was darkness.

At some point I heard a light rumble in the distance, which rapidly passed me by with an obnoxious honk blaring off into the distance.

They kept making me think I was seeing something out of the corner of my eye during my walks. I never really panicked. I’d assume it was a squirrel or a shift in the brush until I focused and saw the slow drift of those damn floaters.



Looking back, I don’t remember my eyes itching on those walks at all. I’d just wander down the vague path that was starting to form.



Eventually work started piling up. I had a backlog of client questions and calls I’d been putting off. Normally I’d have things like that done already, but I’d been busy “helping” in ways that got me out of the office. The boss started sending vague emails about productivity. I finally put in for a half day to see a doctor, and thankfully it was approved.



“Good news — it’s probably nothing serious.” His tone was always flat, which I liked. It felt less performative.



He had me look into a light to test my pupils and muttered something about sluggish response but said irritation could cause that.



“Probably just allergies. Maybe pink eye if we’re unlucky. As for the light sensitivity, it’s likely a bad migraine. Are you taking your medications?”



Of course I was. I’d been taking the same handful of vitamins and prescriptions for years. He pulled down my eyelids and had me look up.



“You’ve got a small conjunctival concretion — not dangerous. Probably unrelated to your symptoms.”



He clicked off his light, prescribed stronger drops, and told me to call if it didn’t improve in a week.



They helped. The gritty feeling eased, and I managed to sleep. The next morning I felt decent — still exhausted, but better. I even cleared a few dozen emails.



Then the following morning I opened my phone and felt a soft pang of eye strain creeping back in. No big deal. Probably still healing. But by the time I was dressed and out the door, I could feel it.



That rough, almost hair-like itch.



He couldn’t chew me out — I’d been bringing him his favorite coffee every other day. Tiffany in the next cubicle said I looked tired. Said I’d been jumpy. I blamed allergies and waved her off.



Sleep became harder to find. I could only rest if I took a short loop through the woods first. Normally I’d never walk through brush at night, but the moonlight seemed bright enough lately, giving everything a silvery sheen. I even spotted a few fireflies. I’d never seen them around here before. Movies don’t do them justice — it wasn’t yellow so much as a faint white glow fading in and out.



I’d take out my phone and snap a few pictures of the scenery, but every one — aside from killing my eyes with the flash — came out wrong. Like some kind of filter had toned everything down. I couldn’t see the flowers, and the fireflies just looked like white dots. I figured it was because the phone was old and probably not great at night photos. Eventually I stopped bringing it. All it did was ruin the silence with a notification or make my eyes hurt when I checked a text.



After that, the irritation gradually came back. Every minute in my chair became more uncomfortable. Eventually I was going to the bathroom every other hour — part to apply eye drops, part to get a break from the glow of my monitor.



I remember standing in front of the mirror, pulling down my lower eyelid to study the inflamed red lines cracking through the pink-white of my eye. I even wondered if it was the tiny white dots near the bottom — what the doctor had called a concretion — maybe they were pushing outward from inside my lid.



I tried gently prodding one with a fingertip.



It felt like it shifted.



Like it receded.



I think people started suspecting something. Conversations got shorter. They began using the water cooler on the opposite side of the building, keeping their distance.



It didn’t help that I was starting to lose focus. I think the lack of sleep was getting to me. I kept catching myself standing near the window, zoning out while looking toward the treeline in the distance.



I got drug tested that week. Came back clean obviously. They said it was random, but I know that’s a lie.



I drifted through the rest of the week, productivity dropping and emails from my manager becoming less routine and more passive-aggressive. The issues with light were getting worse. I started driving earlier in the morning and later at night just to avoid traffic. The exhaustion must’ve been getting to me because I could’ve sworn the office plant in the corner had never bloomed before, but now it clearly had patches of red.



Even my walks weren’t doing me much good. Whenever I hit the end of my little path and turned around, all the tension and discomfort would ratchet back up with every step towards home. The moonlight would feel dimmer, and it started taking me longer and longer to get back and into bed. Three days or so after my checkup, I was walking deeper in than usual, just letting my legs carry me with the hope I'd wear myself out enough to get some decent sleep. I’d unintentionally made a little trail through the brush, which just made it easier to lose myself to the motion of one foot in front of the other.



I still remember rounding that kind of bent tree, stopping, and taking a deep breath. Just letting the moment pass and enjoying the earthy smell of damp soil and the tranquility of it all. When I opened my eyes again, I saw something I still have some trouble really describing.



The woods were quiet, far enough from the road that there wasn’t even the occasional whoosh of a car breaking the peace. At first I thought maybe I’d stumbled across someone else on a walk when I saw the white dot. Figured it was a flashlight.



Then it winked out, causing me to stop mid-stride.



A soft glow, a little further off now. Bright enough to make the moonlight look dim. It was beautiful, if confusing. The closest thing I could compare it to would be a halo radiating colors in faint swirling motions.



It dimmed… then brightened again, further off. Something about it made everything else fade away, like seeing the stars for the first time.



Could fireflies do that? Was this why people always acted like they were such a big deal? I tried to get closer, but it seemed to have just disappeared. Standing there, trying to puzzle it out, something hit me.



My eyes didn’t hurt. For the first time in days, they actually felt…



Normal.



Then it bloomed again — a soft glow to my left — and I found myself shifting, walking toward it. I walked softly, trying not to scare it away so I could get a closer look. And that’s how the rest of my walk went.



It would fade and leave me in darkness, then somewhere off ahead it would brighten again — and I’d follow.



I only realized I was lost when the sun started to rise. I was in a part of the woods I’d never gone to before, standing in front of a rather large tree. Not giant, but definitely older than the trees around it. It seemed lush — a small oasis of light in the middle of a thicker patch of woods.

That wasn't what stood out though.

The tree was covered in softly glowing light. I’d finally gotten close enough that I noticed the buzzing — the space was filled with it. A louder buzz zipped past my ear, making me turn to watch the dim-glowing ball of light land on a nearby bush.



The glow swelled, then dimmed — thin streaks of red and yellow bleeding away with the light until—

All I could see was the shape of a plump black fly.

It sat there, rubbing its little legs together.

I’d expected something lithe, something delicate — maybe with a bulb-lit abdomen — not something that looked so much like the same pests I’d been dealing with all summer.



A few still glowed, buzzing and landing here and there, but as sunlight filtered through the trees the orbs winked out one by one, leaving behind patches of tiny, erratically moving black specks.

The tree that, in the dark, I’d mistaken for something beautiful now showed its truth — bark rotted away in wide patches, its trunk pitted and raw. It was bare of leaves. Only the surrounding trees had lent it that illusion in the dim light of night.

The pressure building behind my eyes snapped me back. My vision blurred, even as I squinted tight, trying to force it into focus.

It wasn’t like the headaches.

It was worse.

It felt like something was pressing in from the edges of my skull, forcing my eyes forward, making them shift in their sockets.

Blinking hurt, the gritty feeling I’d been dealing with now something closer to pinpricks that punished every attempt to squeeze my eyelids shut. I would instinctively squint, only to be immediately forced to open them wide again from the sharp stabbing sensation.



I barely noticed the tears hitting my cheeks — warm liquid running down my chilled skin.



I slid my hand down my face, mostly just succeeding in smearing my tears across my skin.



Then I felt a tingle on my palm — it almost tickled. Something shifted, and I just figured I’d grabbed a fly somehow — they seemed to be everywhere now. Buzzing that had been a dull background drone earlier was suddenly much louder.



When one smacked me in the forehead, I noticed how many were landing on me. They crawled from my arm toward the hand I’d used to wipe my face — and, judging by the tickle on my forehead, down my cheeks as well.



I even had to flick a few of the braver ones away from my eyes as their little feet scurried down my brow.



I flicked and shook my arm, but they were persistent. Even as I backed away, the little bastards kept smacking into me in their attempts to roost.



Something forced me to blink — a fly nearly flying directly into my left eye. The pain made me gasp, and the sensation of something hitting the back of my throat — something I could feel buzzing — sent me into a coughing fit, lurching forward and putting my hands on my knees to brace myself.



I was leaning over, staring at the ground.



At a black shape — thin, but taking up a good chunk of the vision in my left eye.



The thought of a fly’s leg came to mind, and the thought made me retch.



Sitting there in the center of my left eye’s vision was a crooked black line — one that I delicately reached up to wipe away.



Only for it to squirm, shifting in a jerking motion, left and then right until seemingly swimming out of sight.



The realization hit me — the sensation of movement had never really stopped. Not the feeling of tiny feet, but something wetter. Smoother.

And it was getting worse.

I brought my fingertips to the wet feeling on my cheek, and they came away sticky, covered in something tacky with little chunks of white — what I’d thought were just the tears that had dripped down my face and chin. It tasted bitter, and when something wriggled on my tongue, I couldn’t hold it in anymore.



I dropped to my hands and knees, vomit hitting the forest floor and immediately becoming swarmed with crawling, buzzing life. A few faint flickers of light in the shade above my prone body — the only thing breaking up the scene.

With shaking hands I found a nearby tree, the blurring of my vision growing worse by the second. I dug my fingers into the rough bark and managed to haul myself up onto my feet.

I leaned there, trying to spit out the last bit of acid that was burning the back of my throat and tried to focus.

At the time, I thought it was just because I’d held my eyes open so long. Although even after I managed to close them without feeling like I’d slice them open, my vision didn’t refocus.



The forest was nothing more than loosely defined shapes, like I was looking through a pair of glasses that weren’t made for me.



I stumbled away from the big tree, slapping at every feeling of something brushing or moving on my bare skin. I thought that if I just went the opposite direction of it, I’d hopefully be walking back roughly the way I came.



It wasn’t long before it started to get dark, and I had to push down the rising panic. It was early morning — the sun was high in the sky.



My light jog turned into a slow walk after bumping into my first bush, then a slow sliding shuffle after bumping into a log.



After a while, all I could see was darkness.



At some point I heard a light rumble in the distance, which rapidly passed me by with an obnoxious honk blaring off into the distance.



I tapped my foot against the ground — solid. I’d found the road.



Somebody eventually stopped for me, thank God, and got me to a hospital. By the time they actually took me in, my vision was already returning.



The guy who picked me up hadn’t stayed around, but according to somebody who’d been waiting next to me, my eyes were “milk white” when I walked in.



They said I had something called corneal edema. Apparently all the irritation I’d been experiencing lately could make your corneas swell and block out light.



But I don’t think that’s right.



When I got home and started looking over the cuts and bruises I’d gotten, I noticed something small and white on the sleeve of my shirt.



I tried to gently pick it up with my fingertip but only managed to smear it into the fiber of my shirt.



My finger came back with a familiar tacky sensation.",10,1771555112.0,nosleep,3,1.0,False

I’m the founder of a new Aussie app that helps brands capture content in 2 ways:

Customer content

1. for branded campaigns
2. From UGC creators for lifestyle campaign

LOOKING FOR LIFESTYLE CONTRIBUTIONS

If your camera roll is absolutely bursting with everyday life – kids, pets, coffee runs, chaos, exercise, travels… all the real stuff then we’d love to connect with you.

Our brands and small biz clients are under pressure to show up with fresh content every single day… but stock photos, expensive influencers and perfectly staged shoots may not fit the budget or brief every time.

Our brands are looking for real life content – school runs, park hangs, messy houses, holidays, funny little in-between moments they can mix in with product content across their socials.

And we’d love to find some UGC creators in here!

You can:

•	Upload the lifestyle pics and videos you’re already taking

•	Stay faceless if you prefer (hands, kids, pets, coffee, scenery only)

•	Earn brand rewards or micro-payments – no influencer status or big following needed

It’s a genuine win–win: brands get authentic content that actually resonates, and you get rewarded for the moments you’re capturing anyway.

Let me know if you’d be interested and I can DM you the details 🫶",5,1771554950.0,UGCForBrands,20,1.0,False

So, \[\[Lord of Pain\]\] is already a group slug/burn deck. Just run all the pingers to slowly kill the table over time and then LoP comes down and everyone just takes damage from playing the game and hates your guts. Well, what about wheels for it? You already might run pingers to burn the table before LoP comes down anyway, Rakdos is a great discard/reanimation color so dumping your whole hand for a wheel effect is easy to turn into an upside and the LoP has a great ability that helps the biggest downside for wheels. The single biggest downside is 'what if I cast a wheel and don't immediately draw the next'? Now you're passing turn when your opponents have a fresh grip of cards. Normally, this is real damn bad but with LoP, who cares? Give them a fresh grip of cards so they have more spells to kill themselves, it's literally what you want anyway. Combine with \[\[Descent into Avernus\]\] to burn more and give them treasures...literally 'cast all the spells you want, let's get this game over with'. \[\[Pain Magnification\]\] is already a super solid card in the deck as it is then you've got cards like \[\[Burning Inquiry\]\] to screw people over even more. Even better, his whole point is just absolutely screwing people over for playing the game. What's got more 'Saw' energy than casting a wheel? 'Do you want to play a game?

Bakugo stood at the door looking like he regretted every decision that led to this moment.

The door opened, and Mineta’s mom greeted him warmly. “Oh! You must be Katsuki! Come in, come in!”

Bakugo stiffened slightly. “…Yeah. Whatever.”

From behind her, Mineta’s big sister peeked out, smirking. “Ohhh, so this is the scary one.”

Bakugo narrowed his eyes. “…Scary?”

She laughed. “Relax. We’re just messing with you.”

Mineta’s mom smiled sweetly. “He’ll be down in a second.”

Bakugo crossed his arms. “…Yo. Shorty. Hurry up.”

From upstairs: “I HEARD THAT.”

Footsteps thundered down the stairs.

Mineta appeared, freshly dressed, trying to look composed. “…I am not short.”

Bakugo looked him up and down. “…You clean up decent.”

Mineta blinked. “…Was that a compliment?”

“…Don’t push it.”

Mineta’s mom clasped her hands. “You boys have fun, okay?”

His sister added, “And Mineta? Don’t embarrass yourself.”

“…I won’t!”

Bakugo was already walking toward the door. “Let’s move.”

Meanwhile…

Over at Kendo’s place, Nejire had arrived like a burst of sunshine.

Kendo opened the door and nearly got tackled by excitement.

“YOU LOOK SO CUTE!” Nejire shouted.

Kendo blinked. “We’re just going to dinner.”

Nejire grabbed her hand anyway. “Exactly! It’s romantic.”

“It’s a double date.”

“With tension.”

Kendo sighed but couldn’t hide her small smile. “…Is Bakugo ready?”

Nejire grinned mischievously. “He’s pretending he doesn’t care.”

“Which means?”

“He cares.”

Kendo shook her head. “…This is going to be loud.”

Nejire beamed. “That’s what makes it fun!”

Back outside Mineta’s house, Mineta adjusted his necklace nervously.

“…Okay. I’m good. I’m calm. I’m confident.”

Bakugo looked at him sideways. “…You’re talking to yourself.”

“…No I’m not.”

A few moments later, Nejire and Kendo approached from down the street.

Mineta saw Kendo.

And froze.

Completely.

Bakugo noticed immediately. “…You good?”

Mineta swallowed. “…I forgot how to blink.”

Kendo stopped in front of him.

“…Hi.”

“…Hi,” he replied, voice slightly higher than normal.

Bakugo sighed loudly. “If you faint, I’m leaving.”

Nejire clapped her hands. “Okay! Double date time!”

Mineta finally managed to speak properly.

“…You look really good.”

Kendo smiled softly. “…You do too.”

Bakugo turned and started walking. “If you two are done buffering, let’s go.”

Nejire happily hooked her arm through his.

Mineta looked at Kendo.

“…We survived the meet-up.”

She nodded. “Now we survive the date.”

And just like that, the double date officially began.


---

The four of them walked into the restaurant, warm lights glowing over polished tables.

Nejire immediately raised her hand, smiling wide. “Table for four, please!”

The host nodded and led them inside.

For absolutely no reason other than vibes, Mineta was riding on Kendo’s shoulders as they walked in.

Bakugo glanced over, annoyed. “…Why are you up there.”

Mineta shrugged. “Moral support.”

Kendo sighed. “You’re getting down when we sit.”

As they waited to be seated, Mineta leaned forward a little.
“So… what’s your favorite drink?”

Kendo answered calmly, “Black coffee.”

Mineta blinked. “…Straight?”

“Yes.”

“No sugar?”

“No cream.”

Mineta nodded slowly, impressed. “…That’s hardcore.”

They reached their table, and Mineta hopped off her shoulders with a hyped expression like he just entered a boss fight.

Everyone sat down.

The waiter handed out menus.

Mineta stretched his arms. “Alright… me? I’m going crazy tonight.”

Bakugo smirked. “Same.”

Nejire leaned forward excitedly. “What are you getting?”

Mineta slapped the table lightly. “Five bowls of ramen. Eggs, pork, extra everything.”

Bakugo didn’t miss a beat. “Same.”

Kendo looked at Mineta. “Five?”

“…I skipped lunch emotionally.”

Nejire laughed. “You two are ridiculous.”

Kendo closed her menu. “I’ll keep it simple. Sushi and black coffee.”

Mineta glanced at her, smiling. “…That fits you.”

She raised an eyebrow. “What’s that supposed to mean?”

“…Strong. Calm. Scary if disrespected.”

Bakugo huffed. “Accurate.”

Nejire clapped. “This is already my favorite double date ever.”

Mineta leaned back, hands behind his head.
“…Yeah. This is actually nice.”

Kendo looked at him for a moment, then gave a small smile.
“…It is.”

The food hadn’t even arrived yet—

And somehow, the night was already a win.

I got a small bottle of Coffee Essential Oil from work and decided to use it in a fragrance.  I think it is one of the better blends I have made although it was not meant to be a final revision. it was just to learn how these materials work together. 

  
 This is the first blend i made using the coffee EO. It smells ok but it is very powdery and kind of sweeter than i meant to make it.  I have a hunch that a touch of an OUD Material would work here but i have never actually smelled any oud on its own. just in other blends.

(I know my ratios are not great lol)

Bergamot 0.11g

You have been unwillingly hired for the most impossible position in existence: technical support for the Greek gods.

After several millennia of smiting first and troubleshooting never, Olympus has finally decided that perhaps divine infrastructure requires maintenance. Thunderbolts are misfiring. Prophecies are buffering. The Underworld keeps crashing during peak haunting hours. Poseidon insists the oceans are “lagging.” Athena updated something she absolutely should not have.

You are now responsible for maintaining:
• The Cloud (literal clouds)
• The Fates’ ancient server threads
• Mount Olympus’ celestial Wi-Fi
• Ambrosia-powered operating systems
• And whatever Hades keeps installing without approval

The gods submit tickets in all caps. They refuse to reboot. They insist the problem is “not on their end.” Every fix risks triggering a natural disaster, a mythological reboot, or an accidental new constellation.

Your tools include a divine firewall, an enchanted tablet that translates screaming into error codes, and a coffee mug labeled “Have You Tried Sacrificing It and Turning It Off Again?”

Your clients are immortal. Your patience is not.

Keep Olympus online. Prevent reality from blue-screening. And try not to get smote during business hours.

Includes auto cards and inner self.

I don't wanna ghost you. I just don't know what to do so we had a phone call and she said she's not changing her stance with your stance was she just didn't see a future because she's moving to a different city which is only an hour from me. She already lives 45 minutes from me And I said to her I was like why are you worried about the future after only knowing each other for a month and she said I just don't wanna waste anyone's time I still like you. I still have feelings for you and I said then why not continue just going out on dates and getting to know each other I said your house could sellin a month tomorrow it could sell eight months down the road why worry about the future right now so she said I haven't closed the door on us and then I said then you're leaving me here confused I said was your message to reach to me just so you could walk away with a clean conscience or do you want to sit down like adults and talk and she said not opposed to hanging out, but we will see so I asked her to grab a coffee tonight and she text me back saying yes and then text me back a few minutes later saying she is still really sick and she has a bunch of stuff to get prepared for this weekendCan we just leave it where it's at for now and maybe hang out when she's feeling better so now I don't know what to do. I don't know if she's gonna come back or if I should just leave it give it space and go on with my life and if she comes back, she comes back, but if she doesn't, she doesn't. 

I'm just wondering what her saying maybe to hanging out means ",0,1771553377.0,dating_advice,2,0.5,False
