And one of my friends doesn‚Äôt think I should either. But idk. I think I should just not. I‚Äôve actually started sleeping more restfully lately and for longer periods of time. But i sometimes feel exhausted. I just thought coffee would help me feel less tired. I even feel tired while walking. Like I should I just sleep. But I feel coffee isn‚Äôt even doing anything for me. Just making my heart beat faster. Maybe making me more anxious? Plus idk if drinking coffee angers the birds or not.

I know every disclaimer there is of having a mal- he is my third one. Long story short: got my first one when I was 20. He was 4 and a k9 dropout. He raised me into adulthood and taught me to love the breed. I rescued my second. She was my first one that was ‚Äúraw‚Äù. Both sadly passed away within two months of each other- him to old age, her to lymphoma. Trauma. 

Enter third mal. He came from the same place my first one came from. He was only 1.5 so not as heavily trained but vetted with a foundation. I‚Äôve had him 1.5 years now. He is 3. He is great - a headache, has more drive than I‚Äôm used to, but I adapt, he gets out a lot, hiking, lots of obedience training etc. This last year, however, he has started to be reactive towards anything on wheels (not cars thank god). Skateboards, bikes, rollerblades. I live in a city with food delivery robots. It all just started one day and I guess now I‚Äôm entering the acceptance of ‚ÄúI have a reactive dog‚Äù. 

I guess I just need advice- is this forever? I don‚Äôt know why it started, it just started one day with skateboards (I think it‚Äôs the sound?) and escalated. I live in a city so I can‚Äôt predict what we might encounter but it‚Äôs really bringing me down. I used to bring him with me everywhere (coffee shop, happy hour, etc) but now I‚Äôm scared to. Which I hate. Idk. 

I have a trainer, an idea of how to approach this, but I think I‚Äôm just overwhelmed with the possibility that he could forever be lunging at a bike that passes by that I had no idea was coming. 

I just want him to be safe and no one to come for us. There is already a stigma to having a dog that looks like him, one bark at the wrong person and yikes. I don‚Äôt want to think about it. ",1,1750821064.0,reactivedogs,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm on try I don‚Äôt even know how many. I CAN moderate in social settings when I need to.

That wasn‚Äôt what I was planning today. I really, REALLY wanted to feel better, different. I wanted to drink in isolation and clean my house. It‚Äôs a wreck.

I was dependent on marijuana which really really helped-until it didn‚Äôt. I developed CHS and had my first hyperemetic episode (constant puking, needing IV fluids, etc) a little over a month ago. I quit everything (again) then.

I won‚Äôt go into the sob story im dealing with today. I had plenty of excuses.

But I just don‚Äôt want to hear it from my husband. While he was at work today I was at the bank. It was nice out. I thought hm I could just pop into (neighborhood bar) for a couple and that would be nice. But I‚Äôm scared of only having a couple without marijuana to get me through the tail end of drinking, so I didn‚Äôt.

Then later while I was walking my dog I decided to wait until my husband went to bed (I work nights, off today, and he‚Äôs up early so no big) then I‚Äôd go grab myself something and go into what I call gremlin mode, when I just stay up and drink and organize or clean or listen to music, whatever.

But he took FOREVER to fall asleep. And I started crying and he was really sweet to me, and then I made some coffee and was going to put some amaretto in it but I couldn‚Äôt reach the too shelf without a ladder, so I sat outside and drank some plain coffee and realized I didn‚Äôt want to drink alcohol anymore.

-I do plan on eventually swapping out papasan and butterfly chair for a green velvet couch but that is currently not in my budget.
-I am open to changing curtains, they do not have to stay yellow. 
-I do plan on adding gallery art wall and more ambient lighting.
-I want fun earthy tones but I‚Äôm concerned I‚Äôm going to have to much pinky colors in my home, I really like rug number one which is more peachy burnt then like a pepto bismol pink but I‚Äôm trying to make sure it‚Äôs actually aesthetic or do I need more color variation. 
-I also included in the last pic a swatch of all the other colors around my home..a lot of iridescent, purple, pink, green. 
-don‚Äôt judge my 32 in tv I know it‚Äôs tiny ü•∫

Please give me your honest opinions I‚Äôve been struggling trying to pick something for months now. I started with the idea of a bold patterned rug but then I was like maybe solid color long term is better and easier to change furniture with. I‚Äôm open for any suggestions. I just really like the Moroccan Beni Ourain, Azilal, Berber look. I‚Äôm open to ideas, I do prefer wool rug suggestions for durability.

1ljuk4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/kitchenremodel/comments/1ljuk4z/which_layout_is_better/,Which layout is better?,"Layout 1 with the fridge on the sink wall keeps our existing doors/windows in place and I think might have a better work triangle. The issue is that the tall window next to the pantries is only 20"" from the back wall, so the pantries will all have to be modified to 18"" depth which I'm afraid will look dumb next to our fridge. Also there's just a lot of floor space wasted due to the large window that goes nearly to the floor (this used to be the dining nook). 

Layout 2 with the fridge across from the edge of the peninsula would require us to close up the current back door (which goes to the side yard and looks straight into the neighbor's kitchen door), shorten the large window to create a coffee bar/microwave area, and install a new french door leading to the backyard. The biggest benefit to this layout is that we'd get a backyard view and lots of southern light (the small kitchen window is the only south window in the entire house). My house is very dark right now with mostly north windows so that would be fantastic. We would also have a good place for the microwave that I don't think I could fit otherwise.   
  
I am worried that the fridge being across from the peninsula will create a chokepoint though. There would be 45"" from the front of the fridge to the peninsula edge. Also obviously moving doors would require a lot more work and money, new siding etc. And the fridge would be pretty far away from the stove/sink (the room is 16ft long and 11ft wide). 

The door in the dining room is our front door so I'm also considering what the view will be for people entering... either looking directly at the front of the fridge or the side.

Plot: jk is in an abusive relationship with suga but falls in love with v (why exactly was I reading this?‚Ä¶ lmao).
I only remember details of the beginning of the story: chapter 1 starts with jungkook sitting in a coffee shop (of course), looking out of the window and observing the falling snowflakes. He was described as being sad or angry I think and after leaving he meets Taehyung for the first time who‚Äôs outside locking his bicycle (?). Jk keeps coming back to the coffe shop and they eventually become close. Problem is he‚Äôs in a relationship with Yoongi. Their relationship is toxic and abusive and jk tries to leave. Yoongi gets extremely angry but eventually lets him go (i think?). From this part on I sadly don‚Äôt remember how the story continued.

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/9mzk6Z8myi

It has been days of work; I have been working tirelessly for hours. The pumps seem to have a rhythm to them. Every twelve hours or so many of the pumps need to be cleaned. The only upside to this routine is for half the day I am free to rest or explore my confines. Factorium is set up in a messy but somewhat organized way. I am calling its unorthodox style to be organized chaos. The smoke gets worse at the machines near their cleaning schedule. Every day I am consistently buying inhalers, the single token cost tasting bitter in my mouth. I'm averaging about 8 tokens per day. 

The steep cost of water and food has prevented me from unlocking the bunks. I'm spending 6 tokens a day just to get enough to eat and drink. I'm able to save 1 token per day to add to my savings. I have started using the coffee pot in the breakroom to store my extra tokens. The pot sit‚Äôs bright yellow like a hanging sun, causing an uplifting mood in the dreary atmosphere of the Factorium.

Unsure if I should spend my savings on gloves or on unlocking the door to the Bunks. I decided instead to save as many of the tokens as I could skipping meals and adding to my stash in a hope to buy them both simultaneously. The couch in the break room had become my unofficial bed and I had spent the long nights scrunched up on its dirty cushions knowing at least forty-one other people had done the same in my position.

The break room was clean now earning me some tokens, which I spent on some dried meat and water. The more expensive foods and drinks were still outside of my price range. Overseer had slowly become my greatest ally, his warnings were abrupt, but he seemed to genuinely care about me in an offhand sort of way. If I was a part of Factorium, I would receive his full attention for even the smallest of questions. 

Over the days I was working I came to find what I had dubbed the sludge river on the floor below. Through the machines I found a metal staircase that descended to the lower floor. Making sense of my other task to unblock the grates. The sludge river was black and acrid, a thick slurry of the material that was being pumped through the derricks. The smell was enough to gag me as I waided knee deep into the black river to pull away the solid material that blocked the grate. 

I managed to lug the bucket up the stairs full and deposited it in the chute for the extra tokens. While a dirtier job, it was considerably easier work, I also didn‚Äôt have to add another cut to my fingers. By now my fingers were wrapped in old pieces of cloth I had found around Factorium. I had tried to wash them with water but they had kept my fingers from the worst of the cuts. 

My daily routine was enough to keep me busy and docile. Soon I had saved up ten of the yellow tokens in the coffee pot, I decided today would be the day that I would unlock the Break Room and purchase a pair of the work gloves that had taunted me on the vending machine screen for too long. It was a personal victory day, and I expressed as much to Overseer as I removed my makeshift bandages and placed the sturdy leather gloves on my sore fingers. The material was warm and would last against the sharpness of the gears. 

‚ÄúPretty snazzy right?‚Äù I asked to the screen on the wall.

A large smiley face graced the screen and Overseer even winked at me. 

‚ÄúLooking good stud. Congratulations are in order for this big day.‚Äù Overseer wrote on the wall, making digital fireworks explode on the screen.

The PDA on my wrist chimed loudly signalling the start of my day, I glanced at the Bunks door and sighed my frustration.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back.‚Äù I said to the door and headed to the pumps.

I finished my tasks early, Overseer praising me on my newfound efficiency due to my protected hands. The machines had considerably less buildup if they were maintained properly and daily. I found it harder and harder to maintain my eight tokens a day. Today I had only managed to gross seven of the brightly coloured tokens. 

‚ÄúYou are doing well 42. I would like to report an 8% increase in production since you had taken over maintenance.

‚ÄúGoody for that, but higher production means lower tokens in my pocket.‚Äù I replied while emptying another bucket into the chute.

A yellow token fell Into the bowl and I placed it in my pocket. That was the last bucketful for the day and I retreated to the breakroom my lungs feeling heavy and clogged. 

I entered the Break Room and went to the vending machine to purchase my daily inhaler. I quickly slid my token in and pressed the inhaler, my chest wheezing as the machine turned red, rejecting my offer. With surprise I glanced at the screen noticing lots of items in the machine had doubled in price. 

‚ÄúWhat the hell Overseer? You‚Äôre charging me double?‚Äù I asked angrily towards my PDA.

‚ÄúIt is a standard raise of the rates; the prices increase or decrease depending on the availability of the items. As I am sure you haven't noticed the price of gloves has dropped to only two tokens. Ha ha. ‚ÄúOverseer wrote on my wrist PDA following it up with a silly looking smiley face.

‚ÄúGreat.‚Äù I muttered slamming another token into the machine and dispensing the green inhaler, furious that Overseer had lowered the price now that the demand was non-existent.

This was getting ridiculous, I had to find a way to get more tokens easier. I would work myself into an early grave at this rate. The sludge river grates only clogged every three days. Those two tokens plus the eight I earned daily was not going to cut it if food or water went any higher. Bread was still only one token but water had raised to two tokens in these recent changes.

 Uncertain now if I should spend the five tokens on the Bunks door, I relented and deposited my five hard earned tokens into the slot beside the door. With a loud clunk the door popped open, the hinges creaking from lack of use as I entered the Bunks.

The room was surprisingly large with a series of six military style cots. Each had a thin blanket and pillow folded at the end of each bed. The room also came with a large comfy looking armchair one would find next to a fireplace, in front of it was an old-style TV where the back was large and full of complex tubes. A small hallway intersected down at the far side of the room, and I examine the three doors that were held in it. Toilet, Showers, and VIP Lounge were the three additional rooms, costing two, three, and twenty tokens respectively. 

As I returned to the bunk room, my head started to swim. The deep green of the material sending waves of deja vu, forcing me to one knee flashbacks began to surge through as if unbidden like a flood gate opening. Memories of myself entering a long camo tent, dog tags hanging from my neck, running through the forest with men dressed in military uniforms, carrying rifles. Before my PDA chimed happily and I noticed that my tasks had been updated dragging me away from my memories.

1. Maintain all the pumps. Each bucket of sludge removed from the gears and deposited into the chute will receive one token. You need to pull the handle to pause the machine for fifteen seconds. 

2. Unblock the grate, that supplies the liquid into the pipes. You will receive two tokens once the grates have been cleared.

3.  Open the doorway down in the sub-basement, once you enter you shall receive further information. You will receive 5 tokens for completing this task.

‚ÄúWhat is this third task Overseer? Are you being obtuse for a reason?‚Äù I asked as I shook my head trying to clear the images from my past, for some reason they scared me. I knew they were going to be something intense, something I didn‚Äôt want to remember.

‚ÄúIt is a delicate matter, normally the doorway in the sub-basement is not opened or even made aware of to the workers of Factorium, but I fear there is a matter that must be dealt with post haste.‚Äù Overseer explained.

‚ÄúA delicate matter? What does that even mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease retrieve the free tool from the vending machine, and make your way to the sub-basement, once you arrive alert me and I shall provide further instruction on how to enter the room and how to proceed within expectations.‚Äù Overseer responded avoiding the question.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean alert you? Don‚Äôt you have my position on a GPS through this PDA?‚Äù I asked as I reached into the vending machine removing a red handled screwdriver. It was a flat head, and I smiled at the many uses it would provide me with. 

‚ÄúNegative, unfortunately any form of tracking is impossible within Factorium. It is a safety feature we employ to prevent any form of infiltration or mapping. Either of those is a serious issue that will be faced with retribution.‚Äù Overseer responded, remarking on the word retribution once again.

I made my way down the rickety staircase towards the sub-basement, the sludge river as I had dubbed it moved dangerously through the grates, its opaque blackness sending shivers down my spine, the smell of it once had made me gag but after weeks of working in it, I feared I was going nose blind to the scent.

‚ÄúOkay I am here, where is the door?‚Äù I asked my PDA.

As I asked a section of the concrete wall seemingly popped open, upon further inspection I noticed a small set of hinges set into the stone and a small rectangular keyhole. With much effort I forced the door open wide, flooding the inky blackness of the room behind with the industrial orange glow of the sub-basement behind me.

‚ÄúOverseer, it‚Äôs too dark, are there no lights?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúOne moment.‚Äù Overseer responded, after a few seconds orange lights in the dark began to flicker on and off before a large spotlight lit up the room, I covered my eyes against the bright light noticing my eyes had trouble adjusting after living in such low light for so long.

The room that lay before me was mind altering, it was small but large. Sections of it seemed to fall away from my vision, every time I tried to focus on the areas of interest the others would fall away as if hiding from my sight. I took cautious steps into the gloom, feeling a heaviness descend over me. Something about this room felt wrong, but something else about it felt familiar as if I had been here before, as if this was something I had seen in a previous life.

In the center of the room was a large jet-black object, hoses came and went from it in a seemingly random fashion, it seemed to pulse as if breathing or beating. As I stepped closer and closer I could feel it syncing up with my own heartbeat, a humming in my ears as if the whole world was vibrating. I reached my hand out, wanting to touch the blackened heart, my fingers seeking the softness of its edges.

My PDA chimed on my wrist breaking whatever spell the heart had placed upon me, my heart seemed to skip a beat as I jumped in fright.

‚Äú42.‚Äù Overseer wrote.

‚ÄúYes, yes I am here.‚Äù I said not taking my eyes off the black orb. ‚ÄúWhat is this thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is the heart of Factorium, the reason why we both do as we do. But that is not why I have called you into this room. Please avert your eyes and proceed deeper into the chamber. Upon the ground you shall find the real reason why I have sent you here.‚Äù Overseer wrote, allowing me a moment respite from the pounding of the heart.

With much difficulty I was able to pull my eyes away and make my way to the far side of the room, upon the ground was a rather large vent. Pressed against it was a rough looking green fabric. My PDA rang quietly as Overseer explained.

‚ÄúThis is blocking the air vent, please remove the grate with the provided screwdriver and remove it. Dump the item down the chute to receive your 5 tokens.‚Äù 

I began to remove the vent grating curious as to what this material blocking it was, the few probes with the screwdriver let me know the object was solid, but with give under my sharp prods. As the vent gave way, a wave of rotting flesh overtook me. Like something had died in the vent and was slowly decomposing in a rebellious way. With a sharp tug, I began to pull at the green fabric. The object was heavy and awkward to pull up, with some straining I managed to pull it free, its sudden release making me fall backwards as the object fell ontop of me. The green canvas material pulling free as I fell.

On top of me was a decaying corpse, still fresh but with a pungent odor, the peeling skin looked red and angry, it was an older man with a large handlebar mustache. His face was twisted in anger and fury as if he died fighting to escape. His last moments painted on his face, all to surreal as I shoved him off. I felt fear and disgust but the body more frightened me.

 I felt as though somewhere in my past I had seen lots of bodies, I felt desensitized and empty as I stood and regarded the man‚Äôs green canvas jacket. A few stripes of yellow on the arm of his jacket made me realize he had been in the army, maybe a commando. My mind was fuzzy as I pulled him from the room, determined to move him to the chute. 

As I passed by the beating heart of Factorium dragging the decaying corpse by one of his legs. My PDA chimed loudly, without a glance I continued on my way, the heart had a way of making me feel odd. Its pulsing and vibrating seemed to dig deeper into my brain with every second. My chest felt tight as I passed the heart, my PDA chimed again shrilly as if warning me against something.

 Ignoring the PDA in my haste to escape I pulled the body through the door into the sub basement, but the man‚Äôs arm got caught on the inside of the door as if he were holding on, not wanting to leave the room. I pulled and pulled my back towards the black sludge river, my hands gripping his black military boots as I yanked him one last time hearing the sickening snap of bones breaking in the door frame.

Something was wrong I fell backwards, my head feeling light and distant as something overcame me. The blackened heart in the other room pulsed sending a shockwave of black ink cascading from it in all directions as if purging itself of evil. The blast took me in the chest, knocking me free of the corpse and the ground. With a loud splash I fell into the black sludge, my mind racing as I fought to the surface. My lungs and mouth filling with the foul smelling and tasting liquid. As I surfaced, I coughed spitting out the intruder into my mouth.

But I wasn‚Äôt in Factorium anymore, as I broke the surface I was in a river of water surrounded by jungle. A blast of memories flooding to me in a real way, my rifle in my hands I fought out of the cascading torrent, pulling a smaller but similarly dressed young man out of the water and pushing him to the ground as gun shots sounded overhead. I dropped to one knee firing my rifle as grey clad soldiers surrounded us. My rifle taking many down as I stood overwatch over my unconscious comrade, he looked so familiar, but I couldn't place him, my silver dog tags swinging in my battle fury as I fought my way forward from the river's edge dragging the other soldier behind me.

I stumbled forward, my feet giving out beneath me as I returned to the dim and oppressive Factorium. My knees slammed hard into the metal of the staircase, I could hardly breathe or see. My face and clothes were covered in the black sludge of the river, my PDA chimed wildly turning red and flashing. 

‚Äú42, what happened? You should have heeded my warnings; the heart was going to purge after the vent was cleared.‚Äù Overseer wrote.

‚ÄúDamn...‚Äù Was all I said before my stomach retched.

Black liquid poured out of me, pooling around my feet as I emptied my stomach. I felt nauseous and sick as I tried to crawl up the stairs, my PDA chiming loudly as I ignored it. My vision swam and I closed my eyes for a moment, my face resting on the landing to the main floor. The cool metal felt nice as I slipped into a fever fueled nightmare.


Death followed me, everywhere I went. A destroyer of worlds, a destroyer of people. Flashes of my past echoed through my dreams. People‚Äôs faces, locations, the things I had done were unsurmountable. Why was I seeing these things. What was going on.

A chiming filled my ears, piercing through the dream like memories, my eyes opening against my protests as the PDA filled my vision with flashing red lights. Unable to push it away I rose to my knees, my body aching from the place I had collapsed. 

‚Äú42, the pumps are in need of repair, no less than eight of them need to be serviced, respond immediately or face retribution.‚Äù

‚ÄúI feel sick I can‚Äôt do it.‚Äù I said gaining my feet under me, shaking from head to toe as my body rebelled from the foreign substance in my body.

‚ÄúYou are not allowed to be sick, the pumps must be maintained. Please service the pumps within fifteen minutes or face retribution.‚Äù Overseer wrote starting a timer on my PDA.

I ignored my PDA uncaring about what retribution would be in Overseers eyes, I needed to get to the bunks and buy the shower room, the black sludge still covered my body, and I could feel it sinking into my pores clogging them with disease.

I staggered into the bunks, the coffee pot full of my tokens in hand. I dropped the pot as I tripped over one of the beds, the glass smashing against the ground scattering the yellow tokens all over the floor. I scooped up just enough tokens to pay for the shower room and slid them into the slot trying to keep myself from passing out again.

The sludge I had swallowed seems to have entered my system; it was a thousand times worse than the smoke inhalation sickness. As the door to the showers opened, I was greeted by a relatively small room, the shower took up more than half the room and a broken mirror graced the chipped tile wall painted a sickening green colour. I stepped into the dirty glass shower and began the water, ice cold it came out but soon warmed up as I let it soak into my clothes and hair. The water came away black and circled the drain for a moment before disappearing.

‚ÄúJust another grate for me to unclog.‚Äù I said out loud as my PDA pinged angrily in the background.

‚Äú42, you have ignored my request to service the pumps. Punishment must follow.‚Äù Overseer wrote as the water in the shower suddenly stopped.

‚ÄúI can barely stand. How can I service the pumps?‚Äù I said as I left the shower still soaking wet from head to toe, heading to one of the bunks and collapsing in a heap, my body worn out as it fought of the infection, I was sure that was growing inside of me.

‚ÄúYou have forced my hand due to your inaction. All the tokens you have currently saved are now useless, by my estimate you are currently holding on to no more than eleven extra tokens. That amount has been requested to be deposited into the vending machine before you may purchase anything. An additional 50 token debt has been added to you as well for medicine given despite the lack of need for it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat medicine?‚Äù I asked my head still reeling.

A few moments later the PDA pinged once more the screen potraying a medical crest as pain lanced up my arm from under the PDA, I felt a series of needles piercing my skin making me scream in shock as I convulsed on the bunk. Surprisingly after a few minutes I felt myself feeling better before my stomach convulsed angrily and I felt my body reject the black sludge. I leaned over the edge of the bunk and vomited up pure black until my body shook with the effort. 

‚ÄúYou had this medicine the whole time?‚Äù I asked angrily in disbelief, my trust of Overseer breaking instantly.

‚ÄúThis medicine is highly reactive and expensive, the PDA only has one injection. It is normally used for serious cases of the ingestion of the material. While a decent fuel it has been known to be fatal for workers who have ingested or breathed in too many fumes. It is why we supply workers with inhalers to keep them healthy and happy. Ha ha.‚Äù

I got to my feet feeling a hundred pounds lighter but as if I had been injected with energy. Despite my trepidation with Overseer and my now unsurmountable debt. I opened the door to Factorium. Smoke and noise greeted me as I picked up my steel bucket. Red lights flashed over the machines, and I made my way down into the bowels. After I finished my routine and earned a few tokens, I returned to the sludge river. 

The door leading to the heart was securely closed. The man‚Äôs corpse was half in the sludge river, and it took some maneuvering to drag him up the steel staircase. I propped him against the wall next to the chute. My hands searching his body for anything of value, it felt as though I had done this before, and my hands made quick work. I took his green canvas jacket with thoughts to wash it. I checked his wrists but was surprised when I found a smashed PDA on his wrist. On the back of his left hand was an inky black tattoo. The number 40 as prominent as the 42 on my hand. I took one last look at his face, its rough features, thick handlebar mustache, his long mangy tousle of hair, and I let him go. 

Five tokens dropping wordlessly into the slot for my black deed.

* Is there anything you wish your current setup did better?
* Are HR features like time-off tracking worth paying extra for?

Appreciate any insights. I‚Äôd rather spend more time behind the bar than behind a laptop.",5,1750819336.0,coffeeshopowners,1,1.0,False

posted this here because I really want to find someone (or THE someone) out there who shares a lot of interests with me, involved in some fandoms, and maybe someone who is a little creative and likes to create, share, and write (even though this post doesn‚Äôt look the best LMAO) im looking for someone who is willing to connect and hopefully build a strong and solid relationship together!  üñ§

a little about me! ü¶≠
- im usually online a lot, especially during the mornings in which I don‚Äôt have work but in the afternoon I will be online all of the time, i use other apps as my main methods of communication!
-i have a job as a cook, i work in a kitchen making food and whatnot so i won‚Äôt always be online 24/7 but i like to make time for people that are important! like those who like to communicate and interact 
- i love animals, especially seals! a few that I like are puffins, cats, and birds!
- im usually a very passive person who doesn‚Äôt like to initiate any sort of conflict. im not a very competitive person, i like to have fun generally! i have a lot of emotions and i like to use them for the greatest, and I like to dwell on what i am feeling most of the time instead of taking it out on something else, i like to talk about my emotions though sometimes i feel like i have a hard time expressing them, not just to myself but to other people. if you‚Äôre the type of person who is going through something, id love to listen and hear your thoughts!
- i like to party up with a few friends of mine most of the time and talk about video games and such, connecting with others and building friendships are one of the things that are the most important to me!
- if it‚Äôs okay I‚Äôd only like to share photos of me upon request! i have a somewhat skinny build and i am 6‚Äô tall, with short-medium brown hair

things i love to do! 
- one of my favorite things to do is to write, and if you like to write too then we will get along well! i write a lot about characters from video games, sometimes from movies too. i like to be inspired by video games or movies or books and media to come up with stories for characters, i love to make lore about headcanons for characters like from some of the games down below. maybe we can share some stories of ours and write something together? 
- i like to play video games a lot in my free time, like a lot a lot! some of the games i like to play with others are fortnite and roblox, and some that are single player that i love to play are fallout, Farcry, cyberpunk, terraria, borderlands, and minecraft as well! i play on a ps5, if you were wondering!
- i love energy drinks and collect the cans as well! i also like coffee as well, a pretty tame alternative
- i love sharing memes and videos and such that i find funny, usually skits or edits!
- i like movies! probably my favorite movie of all time is tron!
i like music, I listen to bands like jungle, joywave, daft punk, and modjo 

that pretty much sums it up so if you want to send me a chat or dm feel free to message me! i can give you my socials as well! id love to hear from you

Yesterday I went to give offerings. to Mr. Zeus and Lady Athena I gave peanuts, to Mr. Apollo I gave herbal tea that I grow in my backyard.

I left the offerings on the altar, but at the time I remembered ""hmm, it's the solstice, right? Maybe I should let my cats in so they can play or participate in this"".

so I left my bedroom door open and quickly left to turn off something in the kitchen. 

IT WAS A MATTER OF SECONDS! 
My coffee cat was on top of Mr Zeus's altar! At the time I tried to get him out, but I didn't expect him to move, trying to free himself and then giving the peanut offering a little kick, knocking him down.

The room was filled with cats, making a total of 6. 
3 eating the peanuts or others were just playing. 

I just sat on the floor watching that chaos of cats and thinking ""the gods must be laughing or irritated""  

After a while I got up the courage and took the cats out of the room and apologized for the chaos.

It is never something I would have spent for myself, I was contempt with my old water bottles and costco thermos/mugs. 

I'm very impressed and understand the hype now. It is one of those luxuries that I needed to have to know I wanted it. They are durable and insanely good at keeping the liquid inside. Costco thermos mugs kept most of the coffee in, but if it was tipped over and shaken, it would drip everywhere. Yetti almost always keeps everything inside. I still try to keep it upright if it is coffee, but if it is water I can peacefully just throw it in a bag and not worry.

It keeps tempratures so well. Cold drinks stay cold for so long it is incredible. Hot drinks stay hot, for well, too long honestly üòÇ. I miss that about my cheaper thermos mugs. In the costco one I could pour hot coffee in and 15mins later I could drink the coffee fairly quick because it cooled down so much. In the yetti I have to pop the top and let it air out a bit or it will stay too damn hot for 45+ minutes üòÇ. I have to sip it so slow. ",1,1750818699.0,YetiCoolers,0,1.0,False

I want to make it clear straight out of the blocks that this is a video showing the magic in The Philippines - not some trashy vlog talking bad about the country that so many foreigners seem to be making for unbeknownst reasons. Anyway, I really want to show the beauty of this area in the video, HOWEVER, I'm missing one key component - a drone! So, I'm really wondering about a big favour from any local drone pilots who maybe just have any redundant footage laying around that they'd be happy to share and let me use for the purpose of, as I say, showcasing Daraga, Mayon and Bicol in general. This would be a huge help to me and greatly appreciated - flying over the town, over the church, around Mayon - whatever it is, anything would be a great addition to help me make this video.

My wife (35) and I (35) are going to be staying at Barcel√≥ Maya Riviera from July 3rd - 8th and then at a hotel in PDC proper from the 8th - 13th. We don‚Äôt really plan on leaving the resort during the first leg of our stay that much unless someone has a recommendation for something cool to do near there. We are open! 

BUT we definitely need recommendations for our stay in PDC. We are big foodies and enjoy some nightlife here and there. We want to do some excursions and we plan to rent a car for the portion of our trip in PDC. We would love to see some cenotes, ruins, do one ATV excursion, and maybe something on a boat with snorkeling. 

I have read other threads that recommend Coda vs Tulum. We speak the language and are comfortable driving and exploring without needing guides or handholding but we are open to paid tours, etc if it is a good experience for a good price. Would also LOVE some of the best places to eat and get coffee in PDC. At least one super nice restaurant night out and 1-2 nights of good clubs or bars would be great. 

Lastly, we also want to do a day in Isla Mujeres and maybe go to Cozumel. Any recommendations for that are greatly appreciated as well. 

Anyone traveling there these days? Could also meet up with other travelers maybe.

A select group of social media influencers and Tesla investors were invited to participate in the trial, and their experiences were shared online, providing a glimpse into the future of ride-hailing. The trial, which offered a flat fee of $4. 20 for a ride within a geofenced area between 6 a. m. and midnight, was accompanied by a Tesla employee in the front passenger seat, who was responsible for overseeing the ride and intervening if necessary.


Passengers were dropped off at various locations around Austin, including supermarkets, coffee shops... and restaurants, with many expressing their delight with the service. One enthusiastic participant, ""Sawyer Merritt,"" described the experience as ""awesome,"" noting that the safety monitor in the passenger seat did not have control over the vehicle, ""which was entirely operated by the autonomous system.""

1ljtxxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoryConceptRatings/comments/1ljtxxg/the_de_vine_cafe/,The De Vine Cafe,"The sweet scent of baking bread, mingled with the fresh aroma of rain-soaked leaves, created a comforting symphony that filled the air at The DeVine. 

Inside, Robin's brow was furrowed in concentration as she kneaded dough, the rhythmic motion a balm to her anxious soul. The De Vine, her grandmother's legacy, was far more than just a cafe; it was the vibrant heart of Willow Creek, a small town where dreams seemed to be baked into every pie and whispered into every cup of coffee.
Robin, an orphan raised by her eccentric grandmother, had inherited not only the cafe but also a deep-seated belief in the magic that permeated the world. Her grandmother, a woman who spoke to the stars and shared secrets with the wind, had instilled in Robin the profound power of intention. Every ingredient was chosen with meticulous care, every spell a whispered prayer over the dough, each imbued with a touch of the divine.
Life, however, had been a thorny path. Orphaned at a tender age, Robin had faced her share of hardship and loneliness. Yet, she clung steadfastly to her grandmother's teachings, to the conviction that even in the darkest of times, magic could bloom. Jessica, her childhood friend, a vibrant soul whose infectious laugh could chase away the darkest clouds, had become her unwavering rock. Jessica, however, was fiercely protective of Robin, her instincts honed by years of looking out for her best friend.

*A Stormy Arrival*

One particularly stormy afternoon, a tall, brooding stranger walked into The De Vine. His eyes held the weight of a thousand unspoken words, and he introduced himself as Jason. He was a traveler, weary and alone, seeking refuge from the tempest raging outside. Drawn to the enigmatic glint in his eyes, Robin offered him a steaming cup of her signature spiced chai and a generous slice of her grandmother's legendary apple pie, baked with a touch of moonflower magic.
From behind the counter, Jessica observed Jason with a prickle of unease. Something was unsettling about the stranger, an air of profound mystery that shrouded him like a cloak. His captivating eyes held a depth of sadness that made her wary, a quiet intensity that spoke of untold stories.
Jason, a man who had long lived in the shadows, initially resisted the comforting warmth that radiated from The De Vine. He was a fugitive, a brilliant scientist whose groundbreaking work in the realm of consciousness had been deemed a dangerous threat, a direct violation of the established order. He knew he had to remain anonymous, his identity a closely guarded secret, for his very survival depended on it.
Yet, the magic of The De Vine, the subtle whispers of enchantment that permeated the very air, began to chip away at his hardened defenses. He found himself inexplicably drawn to the cafe, to the comforting rhythm of Robin's life, to the way her eyes sparkled with genuine wonder when she spoke of her grandmother's fantastical stories. He started visiting regularly, his initial guardedness slowly melting away, replaced by a quiet curiosity and a growing, undeniable affection for the spirited young woman who poured her heart into every pastry.

*The Unspoken Truth*

News of The De Vine's unique and enchanting atmosphere spread like wildfire throughout the region. Weary travelers, seeking solace from their arduous journeys, sought refuge in its cozy embrace. Local townsfolk, drawn by the tantalizing aroma of freshly baked bread and the whispered tales of the cafe's inherent magic, flocked to its doors. The De Vine quickly became a cherished haven, a place where genuine laughter mingled with the comforting clinking of teacups, where worries were freely shared and nascent dreams were gently nurtured.
Jessica, however, remained unconvinced about Jason. She keenly noticed the subtle ways he flinched when the town gossip, Mrs. Gable, approached his table, or how he skillfully avoided eye contact with the local sheriff, Sheriff Brody‚Äîa gruff but kind man with an exceptionally keen eye for anything unusual. Her suspicions deepened with each passing day, a persistent unease gnawing at her.
As their friendship blossomed, Robin found herself undeniably falling for Jason. She was drawn to his quiet intensity, the profound depth of his intellect, and the way he looked at her as if she held the universe within her gaze. But Jessica's warnings echoed persistently in her mind, a constant, nagging reminder of the potential danger that lurked beneath Jason's composed exterior.
Months turned into seasons. Robin and Jason spent countless hours together, their conversations ranging from profound philosophical debates and the mysteries of the stars to the simple, mundane joys of everyday life. Robin, sensing a persistent distance in him, a palpable reluctance to fully open up, gently pressed him for answers. ""You carry a significant weight, Jason,"" she would say, her hand gently touching his arm. ""You don't have to bear it alone.""
Jason would expertly evade her questions, his gaze shifting away, burdened by an unspoken fear. He feared that revealing his true identity would irrevocably shatter the fragile peace he had miraculously found in Willow Creek. Most of all, he feared losing Robin, the only person who had truly seen him, acknowledged his brilliance and his flaws, and accepted him for who he was.

*A Love Forged in Fire*

 As the threat of discovery loomed ever larger, Jason realized he could no longer keep his crucial secret buried. Sheriff Brody, growing increasingly suspicious with each passing day, was tightening the net around him. He knew, with a heavy heart, that he had to trust Robin, to believe that her love was stronger than any fear or ingrained prejudice.
One quiet evening, under the watchful gaze of the myriad stars, Jason finally confessed. He poured out his heart, revealing his true identity, his deepest fears, and his most fervent hopes. Robin, initially shocked to her core, listened with a complex mixture of fear and awe. She understood, with a profound sense of empathy, the immense weight of his burden, the profound loneliness he had endured for so long.
Instead of fear, Robin felt an overwhelming surge of protectiveness, an undeniable desire to shield him from the powerful forces that sought to control and suppress him. ""I'm not afraid,"" she whispered, her hand finding his and intertwining their fingers. ""I'm with you, Jason. Always.""
Their love, now forged in the crucible of perilous secrecy and pervasive fear, grew stronger than ever before. They faced the escalating challenges together, relying on the unwavering support of the villagers who had come to cherish The De Vine and the palpable magic it held within its walls.
Though they were eventually forced to leave the beloved Willow Creek, their story became a local legend, a testament to the undeniable power of love to overcome fear and the enduring magic that radiated from The De Vine.
Jessica, watching news reports of Jason's groundbreaking and ultimately revolutionary work in the field of consciousness, finally understood the full scope of their journey. She had doubted Jason, questioned his every motive, but in the end, she had to admit that Robin's profound love had seen beyond the shadows, had found the inherent good in the man hiding in plain sight. As she watched the news reports, her heart filled with a bittersweet ache. She had lost her friends, but she knew that their love, like the enduring magic of The De Vine, would forever be woven into the very fabric of Willow Creek, a timeless reminder that even in the face of daunting adversity, hope and love could always find a way to bloom.

Is it reasonable to think that she feels the same way, and would it even be fair to her to try to pursue something more serious?","A lot of background here. Sorry if it‚Äôs rambling, but I‚Äôm trying to process this all as I write. I met a woman about ten weeks ago, and we immediately hit it off. My niece went to school in the city I live in, and she was in town visiting and she hosted a get together for some friends at my place. I had met some of them when she was in school, so it wasn‚Äôt as awkward as you might think for a middle aged guy to be around a bunch of early to mid 20s women. But I met this one friend got the first time on Friday night, and we talked some. Then they came to my house on Sunday, and we got to visit some more. When my niece and her boyfriend had to get on the road to leave town, this particular friend offered to stay and help clean up. She legitimately did help clean up the dishes and stuff, but then she just didn‚Äôt leave. She started looking around my bookshelf and talking about books and authors she likes and stuff like that, so I made some tea, and we talked about our favorite books and art and places we‚Äôve traveled. Eventually I kissed her, and we ended up having sex. Before she left, she said we should see each other again soon, and then we texted some the next day. I told her I felt like I needed to tell my niece what had happened, and so I had that conversation. She was surprised but was ok with it. 

We met for drinks later that week after work, and she came over that weekend as well. By the end of the next week, it was clear this was going to keep happening, so we kind of talked about what this connection was going to be like. We decided that we would just jet things casual, basically fwb, for ac while. We both had some travel plans, so we‚Äôd do that and then if we felt like we needed to revisit it, we would talk again once things settled down a bit.

After about six weeks of seeing each other 2-3 times a week, either getting drinks or coffee at least once and usually having sex about twice a week, her travel plans kicked in, and she was home for almost three weeks. She got home at like 2 am Saturday night, and after she got some rest, we met for coffee, and then went back to my place. It was really good to reconnect, and she ended up spending the night. We both had stuff we had to do the next day, so she left pretty early. We have plans to meet tomorrow after work again, then one or both of us will be out of town until the end of next week. 

So I know that when we‚Äôre back in town, we‚Äôre going to have to have another talk about where this is headed. The truth is, it already feels more like a relationship than just being fuck buddies. The problem is that I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs just in my head or if she feels the same way or what. And honestly, I‚Äôm not sure what I want. I do like her a lot, but I wouldn't say I‚Äôm really attached to her at this point. I don‚Äôt just sit around missing her when she‚Äôs not around, but I definitely think about her a lot, and we talk every day. But, when we‚Äôre together, it Fero‚Äôs like were actually together. And when she got back from her trip, it just felt natural for her to be at my place and even spend the night, which had only happened once before she left. 

Our age difference is obviously a big factor, too. I‚Äôm at the point in life where I didn‚Äôt really want or need a relationship. And I also don‚Äôt want to just fuck around and drag things along if they‚Äôre not going to go anywhere. But at the same ime, I have no reason not to be in a relationship. I also don‚Äôt want to waste her time pretending there‚Äôs something there that isn‚Äôt really there. She‚Äôs sooooo young and has a lot of life to explore. She doesn‚Äôt need to get bogged down with a guy like me and lose out on opportunities to experience life in ways that only a young person can. 

I‚Äôm honestly not sure what her thoughts are, but other people have commented that we definitely seem like more than just casual friends. Like if we meet after work and other people are there, it‚Äôs clear to everyone that we are together. We just haven‚Äôt said exactly what being together means at this point.

Now he says I drove him away. How do I stop clinging to a future that‚Äôs no longer real when I‚Äôm scared to grieve?,"I (31F) recently had my partner (38M) tell me he stopped loving me. This was after months of me checking in, asking if I‚Äôd done anything wrong, noticing snarky comments, him not responding when I talk to him, or have him scrolling endlessly on his phone when we were together. He also asked that I don‚Äôt touch, cuddle or be affectionate with him. I knew there was something deeply wrong but he said he was ‚Äòfine‚Äô and then he would do some small act of kindness like buy me a coffee or send me a short text when I was spiralling with all these stressful thoughts that he really, really resented me which gave me false hope but confused me. 

I moved across the country to be with him, gave up my job, closeness to family and friends, and found myself constantly apologising to try and get us out of this emotional struggle. Early on in the move, I was struggling with the transition and feeling isolated. Years later he told me he interpreted that as me being critical of him and said that was when he ‚Äúturned off emotionally.‚Äù

Last year he said my hurtful words made him shut down. I never said things to cause pain, I was overwhelmed. But once he said that, I made a conscious effort to engage with him lovingly, vulnerably, and I regularly apologised for moments of dysregulation. I‚Äôve also been in therapy and took time off work due to the emotional toll.

He continued to withdraw. He often gave me silence for days or sent unrelated checks in during these times while I tried to keep being emotionally present. When I eventually said I felt like I was carrying the emotional weight of the relationship alone, he told me I was ‚Äúblaming him‚Äù and that was why it failed.

I‚Äôm not blaming him. I know I‚Äôm flawed, I‚Äôve taken responsibility for the hurt I caused. I‚Äôve apologised and worked hard to repair. But now I‚Äôm left wondering how I stop chasing the hope that it can still work, when the person I loved has told me they‚Äôve already let go. He admitted to not loving me after I was crying asking him to tell me what was wrong. 

I‚Äôm not looking to vent or blame. I just feel stuck.

1ljtkfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestation/comments/1ljtkfp/living_in_the_present_easy/,Living in the present - EASY,"In the manifestation community there is a lot of emphasis on living in the present and living in the moment. I definitely agree that it is a very important component of manifestation if not the most important part of it. However, I am afraid a lot of people tend to get it wrong or even share the wrong message about it.

If you ask me, and I say from experience, the best way to live in the present and improve your self concept is to spend time with people and doing things you love. Watch how I don't necessarily say ""people you love"". I think spending time with people and community will really help you ground yourself and it will hype yourself to better your self concept. 

  
Don't believe me? That is okay, but here are my examples. Two years ago, I was in love with a friend and unfortunately he never felt that way. I manifested hard, affirmations, robotic affirmations, journaling meditation, EVERYTHING. I opted to always spend time with him or to manifest rather than focus on myself and the people around me who was there. This went on for 9 months. It was so difficult to see the light, and I even started to disbelieve manifestation. However, around this time I started volunteering at a community kitchen and hanging out more with my friends. I was still affirming but unconsciously, I started to realise that my affirmations started to change from focusing on the friend to love me back to me finding a genuine connection and a person who loved me for me love and who taught me love was easy. Within 2 months, I met someone like that, my current fianc√©. He is everything I wished for and our love is so easy. I have never needed to keep affirming obsessively to keep him in my life, because I realised with him but also all the other people around me, I was living in the present and I had a better self concept.

  
I have so many more stories like this and how I genuinely felt my life get better when I surrounded myself with people. I also know it is getting harder to find people and community however, here are my tips for it:

1. Call or text old friends or your family atleast once a week

2. Plan to meet someone for coffee/dinner/ cook together atleast once a week

3. Join your favourite interest group: I promise you there is one in your town. Libraries are a great way to start

4. Make small talk. I promise you talking about the weather is the best way to stay in the present.

So, for context I live in, essentially, the country 15 minutes from a small town. 

There's hardly anything to do. 35 minutes away there's a bigger town/city? where I work/sometimes go there to do stuff. 

Though, I've been driving every once a week/two weeks (depending on the week), to a bigger city. The drive is a mininum 1hr 35min one way. So basically 3+ hrs in total. 

I do this because I've been longing to do anything. I mean sure I could go to places near me but I like to socialize or be where people are (more people/a lot of people). I like to see their faces, see how humans interact, etc. 

So I've been going to these big cities, and spend that day at coffee shops, shopping, going to parks, eating from local places there. 

However, when I'm not there or not working. I literally am not motivated to do anything. I feel almost empty because I can't do anything with anyone, even at the big cities I drive to, as I have no friends. 

I have literally forced myself to be a member in things at my church, or work 30+ hrs at work, because if I don't I know will stay home and just feel sorry for myself. 

I usually workout too, 5 days a week (I haven't the last 2 weeks cuz I did something to my back ü´†). 

I do feel sad sometimes, and I'm ashamed to say to stop from feeling anything I will continuously have a video either playing, or be listening to a long podcast (3+ hrs, usually in theology so that's helps me a bit lol), read, or scrolling Instagram (this one has gotten progressively worst). 
Also I've been wanting to get back to college, but I've had to take a semester off because I still have to pay for the semester before that. I was looking forward to going back in the fall, but with all the money I owe I might have to wait ANOTHER semester. The people I went to highschool with all graduated this year and that was low-key a stab to the gut (I took a gap year after hs, separate thing from this semester).

I'm frustrated I can't socialize, or hang out with friends/bf (cuz I don't have any), I can't go to the populated areas I like except like 3 times month (maybe less), and I can't go back to college. 

Essentially the lack of communication (no friends, in fact I don't think I've ""hung out"" with anyone as a friend in 3 1/2 years--- it's definitely getting to me.... before I could control my emotions and now the toll is hitting me like a train) and lack of people everywhere/ lack of things to do near me is driving me insane. 

I don't even know if I remember how to make friends anymore, I can talk easily enough and am not shy, not really. I just....I don't even know anymore. I swear I'm slowly internally dying **sobs**. 

I feel like if I didn't watch well written movies religiously (I very much do), read, or have faith my empathy would've been lost ages ago. However, some days I do feel that I'm slowly loosing empathy, which is what I want to NOT happen. 

I've been trying to get more prayer time in and even started somewhat Bible journaling, that's helped....

Also I thought I should add this, sometimes I feel I'll die early, others day I feel I'll live a full live. I don't know what my mind is trying to tell me XD.

I run Shadowdark games at a local coffee shop that has game nights once a month. They're usually gauntlets to introduce new players to the system. In doing so, I've noticed that most of the players are more visual players than theater-of-the-mind players. I've tried to explain that the game is mostly in abstract distances but they don't quite seem to get it. I can't afford a TV setup to carry around (nor can the place afford it either) nor am I able to provide printed maps as I am on a budget.

What I thought was since there are abstract distances, all is really needed is something to represent those distances to the players while using miniatures. What I came up with was a printable ""area"" map of sorts.

I started out with the image printed on a legal-sized piece of paper but it was not big enough for everyone to reach if they all chose to control their own mini. As I sat there one night, there were a group of Magic players there and they had playmats. Then it hit me ...

I looked up custom playmats and found a site that prints them so I made the image above and had it printed on a playmat. I haven't received it yet but I wanted to share the images so that you could print your own playmats.

I added sections for each of the movement types as well as for Near and Far. Close can be represented inside the each block by just placing the minis adjacent to each other.

I also made two sizes in two different formats: 28x14 and 24x14 in JPG and PNG format. [Inked Gaming](https://www.inkedgaming.com/) requires JPG and [Your Playmat](https://www.yourplaymat.com/) requires PNG.

The air was thick with the scent of polished marble and the hum of hushed conversations. The elevator doors slid open, revealing a world of stark contrasts: the cold, clinical efficiency of the corporate world, and the pulsating energy of the secret floor hidden beneath.

Maxim, a man of ice and fire, stepped out of the elevator. His eyes, as cold as the steel beneath his feet, scanned the room. He was a self-made billionaire, a strategist who had built an empire with a sharp tongue and sharper instincts. His suit, tailored to perfection, clung to his muscular frame, a testament to his control over every aspect of his life. His touch, when he reached for his coffee, was deliberate, a calculated move that left no room for error.

Across the room, Lannah stood, a vision of elegance amidst the chaos. Her eyes, a warm hazel, flicked over him, taking in his every detail. She was composed, confident, a woman who walked through the world with grace and restraint. Beneath her polished exterior, however, there was a deep, aching hunger she had never dared to name. She was used to being in control‚Äîof herself, her career, her emotions‚Äîbut something about Maxim awakened something primal within her. As their eyes met, she felt a thrill, a spark of something she couldn't quite define.

Lannah receives a cryptic, unsigned message delivered via internal courier: ‚ÄúAfter hours. 67th Floor. Come alone.

Lannah's heart pounded in her chest as she stood in the elevator, the numbers above the door ticking down to the 67th floor. She had never been here before, and the secrecy of it all sent a shiver down her spine. She had resisted the urge to find out more about this mysterious floor, but her curiosity was too strong. As the elevator doors opened, she stepped out, her heels clicking against the marble floor.

Maxim was standing by the window, his back to her, his reflection in the glass revealing a hint of a smile. He turned, and their eyes met. There was a spark in his gaze, a promise of something dangerous and exhilarating. He walked towards her, his steps measured, deliberate. Lannah felt her breath catch in her throat as he reached out, his hand cupping her cheek. His touch was like a brand, searing her skin, awakening a hunger she had never known.

""Lannah,"" he murmured, his voice a low rumble. ""You came."" His thumb brushed against her lips, and she felt a jolt of desire. She leaned into his touch, her eyes fluttering closed. When she opened them again, she found herself lost in his gaze. He leaned in, his lips a whisper away from hers. ""I've been waiting for you,"" he said, his voice barely audible. And then, he kissed her. It was a kiss that promised more, a kiss that demanded surrender. His hands roamed her body, exploring, claiming. Lannah felt her body respond, her nipples hardening, her breath coming in short gasps. She was lost in him, in the sensation of his touch, the taste of his lips. She knew she should resist, should walk away, but she couldn't. She was his, completely and utterly.

Lannah's breath hitched as Maxim's fingers traced the line of her jaw, his touch sending shivers down her spine. She could feel the heat of his body, the intensity of his gaze as it held hers captive. ""I don't understand why you're doing this,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible. ""What do you want from me?"" His smile was predatory, a hint of danger lurking in the corner of his lips. ""I want to see you break, Lannah. I want to see the woman beneath the ice queen. One night. No strings. Complete surrender.""

1ljtfz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1ljtfz1/fasting_helped_me/,Fasting helped me.,"Hey y‚Äôall, I‚Äôm a march 2020 hauler.
I had the following symptoms after my infection: SOB, chest pains, PEM, depression, anxiety, dysautonomia, allergic reactions, hives, severe migraines and extreme exhaustion, alcohol and coffee intolerance, brain fog, numbness/tingling, internal vibrations, you name it.

I was bedridden for a year.
The second year was a little better as far as getting out of bed and getting back to work but I could do absolutely no extracurricular activities outside of work. 
Third year I got Covid again at work, and went back to bedridden with gastro issues, PEM, and the worst headaches of my life. 
Fourth year I was ok but still just felt like I was at 60% and functioning to do everything the best I could. 
Even when I felt physically a lil better I had this severe anxiety I couldn‚Äôt shake.

I became so sensitive to medications that I couldn‚Äôt even take antidepressants. 

Well at the beginning of this year I decided to try fasting.
I tried a few listed IF fasts that I never stuck to.

Finally I decided to just do what felt right for me and it ended up being fast til 5. 6 days a week.

So I basically fast til 5pm everyday, unless I need some extra energy (especially on my menstrual) in which case I will eat a scoop of peanut butter or drink a protein shake. But I do not eat a meal til 5pm. Medium sized meal. Then on the weekend I pick a day I want to break the fast and I‚Äôll eat lunch and dinner that day. Then return back to my fast the following day. 

I talked to my endocrinologist and primary about my fast and they are fully supportive as they‚Äôve monitored me and see it works for me. 

Basically I have zero symptoms now. No headaches, no exhaustion, and I‚Äôm able to work out again. And the best part is I haven‚Äôt had anxiety or depression since I was a week into it. I‚Äôm 5 months no symptoms.

This might not work for everyone and always consult your doctor if you‚Äôre going to try fasting to make sure your body can handle it‚Ä¶.

But I just wanted to shout this out.
And hugs to everyone struggling, I see you. 
I‚Äôll update every few months. 

Side note: no meds or vitamins really made big changes for me. 

But some things I learned:

-NAD+ patches are a god send when I get sick with cold or flu and my pots would flare up. The NAD would get me through the illness a lil quicker. (Ordered on agelessrx)

-taking Allegra and Pepcid everyday can cause severe migraines. This combo has been recommended a lot for the histamine issues, and my immunologist even put me on the protocol but after a few months I started having terrible headaches that were worse than my usual covid headaches. My neuro told me to get tf off Pepcid and Allegra, I did and the headaches went away. This might not be the case for everyone and I know that combo helps a lot of people but if you take them and are experiencing new headaches then this is for you. Talk to your doc about maybe trying without to see if headaches improve.",13,1750816380.0,covidlonghaulers,10,1.0,False

I‚Äôve applied to hundreds of internships, scholarships, programs, conferences, and events, etc. Nothing works.

I‚Äôm ready to work. I‚Äôm ready to learn. I‚Äôm ready to do anything. But I‚Äôm not getting any opportunities.

People talked about missed opportunities, while I'm begging to get one.

I came to the realization that you genuinely have to be rich to make it in life. The majority of top finance, consulting and acting jobs go to people who attend top schools. Those people also end up going to private boarding schools before attending university, which cost like 40k a year. In other words, they were born rich.

Yeah, there‚Äôs some people who gets a high-caliber job, but the majority of the opportunities in life go to these stuck-up rich people who don‚Äôt want to help others. They have this circle where they only want to give opportunities to other rich people, creating this enclosed circle.

I‚Äôve been networking like crazy at school, networking events, nonprofit organizations, Linkedin etc. I wasn‚Äôt born rich. I‚Äôm starting my career from the absolute bottom. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

My life feels miserable now that I don't have any internship. I have so many dreams and aspirations, and I‚Äôm willing to perform. But I‚Äôm not getting any chances.

I‚Äôm just a broke college student. All my aspirations are crushed because I‚Äôm broke with no industry connections. Most people don‚Äôt want to help me out or know anyone, despite reaching out. I need to get rich.

I‚Äôve linked a couple more posts about my resume and job process if you want to understand me better.

Memory Transcription Subject: Roesh, Thafki Immigrant

Date [standardized Earth time]: September 23, 2137

A faint vibration against my cheek pulled me to consciousness. The sound of gentle breathing in front of me assured me that my plan had succeeded, and my wonderful husband was still soundly asleep. My tail wagged softly as I carefully removed my arm from Hilsfeer before sliding myself silently to the floor. As I gently closed the door to our bedroom, I made a mental note to thank Rowan for his idea to set the alarm on our datapad to vibrate. 

*And thank the Stars he wanted to be the little spoon tonight to celebrate making it through his first interview.*

The sun was just barely peeking over the horizon as I crept through our living room towards the front door. Tossing my pack over my shoulder, I stepped out into the warm early morning breeze. I flipped through the files on my pad until I found the secret file I had hidden from my love buried deep within countless subfolders.

I double checked the list of ingredients Rowan and Emma had shared with me before switching to the maps program. My quick research last night told me it should be open by the time I walked there, but I wanted to double check to make sure I didn‚Äôt end up having to sit around waiting for them to open. I wasn‚Äôt sure I was completely ready to wait out in the open by myself, surrounded by humans, and didn‚Äôt want to risk spiraling on what was supposed to be a special day for my love. 

*Deep breaths, Roesh, you can always call Rowan if you start to feel too overwhelmed. He told you he‚Äôd be awake if you needed help. You‚Äôve got this.*

The boardwalk was even less crowded than it had been during my last excursion. It seemed humans enjoyed sleeping in on their days off just as much as the rest of the galaxy. I pulled out my pad and checked one more time to make sure the grocery store wasn‚Äôt going to be closed for the weekend. Breathing a quick sigh of relief as I saw its status on GogoMaps had already been updated to ‚Äòopen.‚Äô

I was halfway to my destination when a soft yet rapid thudding noise from behind me caught my attention. I quickly swiveled my head to locate the source of the strange sound, freezing in place as I spotted it. A human was running directly towards me. Her eyes laser focused on her target.  I couldn‚Äôt even breath, let alone make my escape, as she quickly gained on me. What had I done to anger her? Humans were supposed to be able to resist their instincts! She was almost upon me now. My heart was pounding in my chest. Why didn‚Äôt I ask Rowan to come with me? He‚Äôd have kept me safe! She was almost within striking distance. This was it.

‚ÄúMornin,‚Äù she called out with a wave as she continued running right past me. 

*I‚Äôm‚Ä¶alive?*

Fear was slowly being replaced with confusion as my thoughts swirled around in my head. I didn‚Äôt want to be rude and upset this strange human, so I managed to squeak out a ‚Äúmorning‚Äù. But despite my efforts , it was long after she could reasonably be expected to still hear me. As my heart rate slowly returned to normal, I quickly pulled out my datapad and messaged the only person I felt I could trust to tell me what had just happened.

‚ÄúGood morning, Rowan. I‚Äôm on the boardwalk and a human just ran straight at me before continuing past me. Do you know why she might have done that?‚Äù 

Almost instantly the bubbles indicating that he was typing popped up. 

‚ÄúRoesh, are you okay? Do you need me to come get you? Where are you? I‚Äôll be right there.‚Äù

A tinge of guilt tugged at my heartstrings as I questioned how I could still feel any fear towards someone as kind as Rowan before I replied. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay. I just want to know if this is normal human behavior or if I should be worried. Please let me know.‚Äù

Rowan took a moment to start typing again. I assumed he was trying to find the gentlest way to explain something extremely predatory to me. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs normal human behavior. Some humans enjoy exercising for fun and an early morning jog is a lot of peoples preferred way to start the day. I assure you that you are in no danger from joggers.‚Äù

*They like to run for entertainment? Stars, no wonder their species has such freaky endurance.*

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I understand why you would simulate fleeing for entertainment, but thank you for explaining,‚Äù I quickly typed back.

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Rowan replied almost instantly, ‚Äúfeel free to ask me any more questions you might have. More than happy to help!‚Äù

‚ÄúI will, thank you.‚Äù I sent off the message before switching back to the map. I was only a few minutes from my destination now, and didn‚Äôt want to waste any more time and risk my beloved waking up before I got home.

Just like last time, the cool breeze from the store was a nice contrast to the warm, damp air I was escaping. I flipped back to my secret file and began searching for the ingredients Rowan had sent me to make my beloved a human breakfast. 

‚ÄúOkay, looks like I need oats, maple syrup, strawberries, almond-‚Äù I fought down a gag as I read the next word, despite Rowan assuring me it was not actually dairy, ‚Äúmilk and chia seeds. Seems easy enough.‚Äù

I quickly found everything I needed except for the chia seeds. It felt like I had wandered down every aisle, but the elusive seed was nowhere to be found. Frustration was starting to bubble up inside me when I spotted a familiar human once again crouched down and stocking shelves. Remembering how badly we startled him last time. I called out to him from down the aisle.

‚ÄúGood morning!‚Äù

I watched as the human practically yelped before jumping to his feet.

‚ÄúOh good morning Mr‚Ä¶Roach?‚Äù

‚ÄúRoesh,‚Äù I corrected.

‚ÄúYes, Roesh, um, what can I help you with?‚Äù he asked nervously.

‚ÄúApologies, but I can‚Äôt find chia seeds. Could you help me?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh um, right this way.‚Äù He quickly walked off with his arms stiffly at his side, leading me to the next aisle over. ‚ÄúHere you are.‚Äù I fought back a giggle as he held his palm up to a bag on the top shelf like a salesman showing off a new car.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù he continued standing there, staring awkwardly at me, ‚Äúum, would you mind getting them down for me? I can‚Äôt reach that high‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, um yes, of course, sir.‚Äù He grabbed one of the bags and a look of pure panic washed over his face as he began to hand it to me.

‚ÄúYou can just place it on the ground if it‚Äôs easier for you,‚Äù I said with a reassuring tail wag.

‚ÄúOhgodthankyou,‚Äù he said something too fast for my translator to register as he practically dropped the bag to the floor, but I could easily tell it was a signal of relief. 

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù I picked up the small bag and tossed it into my basket. ‚ÄúUm, sorry for scaring you‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault,‚Äù he quickly blurted out as his face turned red. ‚ÄúI just um, you know, it‚Äôs just hard to-‚Äù

I cut him off, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, you don‚Äôt have to explain it to me. I understand. I won‚Äôt take up any more of your time, have a good rest of your day, Martin.‚Äù I gave him an ear flick that I hoped came off as reassuring to him.

‚ÄúYou remembered my name?‚Äù His face lit up slightly at that. ‚ÄúUm, have a good day as well, Mr. Roesh.‚Äù

I had one last stop on my journey before I could get back to my beloved. One that I was much more excited for. I was still about a block away, but the smell of fresh baked goods was already filling my nostrils and setting my tail into an involuntary wag as I approached the cafe. I almost hated how convenient this place was; the temptation of sweets practically in my backyard was a hard one to resist. The only thing keeping me from stopping by every morning is our lack of stable income to fuel my new addiction.

I pushed open the heavy doors to the bakery, my eyes instantly locked on the display case of baked goods laid out in front of me, but something out of the corner of my eye caused me to do a double take. I almost didn‚Äôt notice them with the hooded garment covering their head which was face down on the table. But there was no missing that distinctive tail dangling haphazardly from their booth.

*Oh my stars, what is a Venlil doing here? Are they okay? Poor thing must be so overwhelmed surrounded by all these humans that they can‚Äôt even move! I need to help them.*

Feeling much more confident than I would be if I was approaching a frightened human, I scurried over towards the Venlil. I expected to hear sniffling as I got closer, but he wasn‚Äôt making a sound. Was he so frightened that he couldn‚Äôt even cry anymore? 

‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù I said softly to no response, ‚Äúare you alright?‚Äù 

There was still no response from the Venlil. Poor guy must be catatonic if he couldn‚Äôt even register my voice. I reached out and gently placed my paw on his shoulder in an attempt to comfort him, but he still didn‚Äôt move. I was starting to get worried something was seriously wrong at this point. I could feel panic starting to rush through me as I gently shook him. It took a few soft nudges before his head quickly shot up from the table.

‚ÄúShit, I‚Äôm awake.‚Äù His eyes quickly scanned the room before falling on me. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I expected a look of relief on his face or what, but I definitely wasn‚Äôt expecting the same look Hilsfeer gave me whenever he woke up with a fever and could barely remember where he was. He stared at me for a few more seconds, and I finally noticed how orange the sides of his eyes were.

*Was he crying?* 

‚ÄúHello, I‚Äôm sorry for bothering you, but I saw you with your face down in the corner by yourself and got worried. Are you okay?‚Äù

A look of realization finally spread over this face and I saw a faint bloom forming in his ears. 

‚ÄúOh stars, I must have fallen asleep,‚Äù he said with a yawn and stretch. ‚ÄúWhat time is it?‚Äù 

I couldn‚Äôt believe what I was hearing. He had been sleeping surrounded by humans? How was that possible? I figured even someone as brave as Hilsfeer had to have some fear chemicals running through his body surrounded by all these predators humans! How could someone just doze off? Had he been around humans that long?

*Of course he has, look at him, he‚Äôs wearing clothing. Clothing! He was probably first in line for the exchange program!*

‚ÄúHey, you okay?‚Äù a gentle voice brought me back to reality. ‚ÄúYou were given‚Äô me the thousand yard stare.‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh? Oh, yes, I‚Äôm okay.‚Äù I felt a bloom taking over my own face at the fact I had come over here to comfort him and now he needed to check up on me. 

*Dammit, stop being so weak!* 

Concern was still written all over his face, but he looked like he was deciding whether to press me on it when I suddenly remembered he asked me a question and quickly pulled out my datapad. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting close to nine.‚Äù 

‚ÄúShit, seriously?‚Äù I signaled ‚Äòyes‚Äô with my tail. ‚ÄúDammit, so much for just resting my eyes for a few minutes.‚Äù 

He rubbed his eyes on his hoodie before stretching out again. I noticed a faint glint from his right arm as it caught the sun before he brought it back to his side. I wasn‚Äôt sure if he caught me staring as he quickly moved the appendage out of my line of sight.

‚ÄúWell, at least you woke me before Jacob did, so thanks for that.‚Äù He formed his mouth into one of the human‚Äôs smiles as he spoke. 

‚ÄúJacob?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúMy friend, and, I guess technically, landlord. He‚Äôs here on a business trip, but he‚Äôs scared of flying so I came with him.‚Äù

They were here with a human? I tried to assure myself they had to be a nice human if this Venlil was willing to travel with them, but I felt my heart was racing. Would they be mad if I approached their friend? No, no, that's stupid. Get it together, Roesh. 

‚ÄúDid you say he‚Äôs afraid of flying?‚Äù I asked and the Venlil responded with a quick ear flick. ‚ÄúHuh, I‚Äôve never met anyone who was afraid of flying before.‚Äù

*That and I kind of forgot humans can get scared too‚Ä¶*

‚ÄúYeah, it sounds silly with how safe it is, but it freaks him out, so I didn‚Äôt want him to have to fly alone, and decided to take a week off work to come with.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, well that was nice of you,‚Äù I said with a wag. ‚ÄúUm, where is he?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, if it‚Äôs almost nine like you said, then he should be here any minute. We were supposed to meet for breakfast after his first meeting. Don‚Äôt worry, he‚Äôs really nice, but you can head out before he gets here if you want.‚Äù 

He must have noticed a look of fear on my face as he added that last part. I was tempted to take him up on his offer, but I knew I couldn‚Äôt keep avoiding humans forever if I was going to live on Earth. Maybe meeting someone that passed the screening to be in the initial exchange program would be easier? I mean, how scary could they be if even the Venlil weren‚Äôt afraid of them?

‚ÄúN-no, I can stick around. I mean, I haven‚Äôt seen anyone else that wasn‚Äôt from Earth since I got here. It‚Äôs nice to speak to someone who kinda gets what I‚Äôm going through, ya know?‚Äù 

He didn‚Äôt seem completely convinced, but he at least didn‚Äôt seem annoyed by my intrusion.

‚ÄúWell, in that case, I‚Äôm gonna grab some coffee so I don‚Äôt fall asleep on you again.‚Äù He hopped out of the booth. ‚ÄúYou want anything? My treat.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, sure! But you don‚Äôt have to do that.‚Äù

The Venlil shrugged his shoulders in a very human way. ‚ÄúConsider it payment for saving me the embarrassment of having Jacob find me asleep. He‚Äôd never let me live it down after he kept telling me to sleep on our flight instead of playin‚Äô video games the entire time.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh, thank you then.‚Äù I followed him up to the counter where he signalled for one of the humans' attention. 

‚ÄúGood mornin‚Äô, what can I get for ya?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll take two of the strongest coffee you‚Äôve got,‚Äù the Venlil replied in English before looking over at me and speaking in his native tongue again. ‚ÄúGet whatever you want.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll have a lamington,‚Äù I managed to keep my voice from squeaking as I spoke to the woman behind the counter.

‚ÄúNo coffee?‚Äù the Venlil asked with a head tilt.

‚ÄúNever had it, is it any good?‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh you are in for a treat, it is one of humanity's best inventions.‚Äù He paused for a moment. ‚ÄúJudging by the lamington I‚Äôm guessing you like sweets?‚Äù I gave him an affirmative tail flick. ‚ÄúIn that case,‚Äù he turned back to the server, speaking in English once more, ‚Äúthrow in a cappuccino with almond milk for my friend here.‚Äù 

‚ÄúCan I get a name for the order?‚Äù 

‚ÄúSivik,‚Äù he replied as he tapped his datapad to pay. 

Feeling myself bloom once more upon realizing we hadn‚Äôt exchanged names yet, I followed Sivik back to the booth I had found him in. 

‚ÄúMy names Roesh, by the way.‚Äù

‚ÄúHm? Oh, we did forget to exchange names, didn‚Äôt we?‚Äù he chuckled slightly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you heard it back there, but the name‚Äôs Sivik, or ‚ÄòSiv‚Äô if you‚Äôre my annoying best friend. Nice to meet you.‚Äù

He stretched his arm out towards me expectantly. Remembering what Rowan had shown me, I reached out and clasped his paw in mine. I managed to avoid gasping in surprise as the metal of his prosthetic paw grabbed mine back and shook my arm up and down.

‚ÄúNice to meet you as well.‚Äù I pulled my arm awkwardly back to my side. ‚ÄúUm, how long have you been on Earth?‚Äù

‚ÄúA year next month.‚Äù

*A full cycle? Was he here during? No, no, don‚Äôt let that thought take root. Not now.*

‚ÄúOh wow. Guess that explains how you know English,‚Äù I chuckled nervously. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve only been here about three days now.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù I signalled ‚Äòyes‚Äô. ‚ÄúIs this your first time around humans?‚Äù ‚ÄòYes‚Äô again. ‚ÄúWell, in that case, let me just say, you are acclimatizing a lot better than you could be.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think so?‚Äù He flicked his ears prompting me to give him a forlorn sigh. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt feel like I am. I still get so scared around humans. I had to lock myself in the bathroom and float in the tub just a few days ago because I got too overwhelmed‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd yet, here you are out on your own. I think that‚Äôs pretty impressive.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù I felt my face blooming once more. ‚ÄúWas it hard for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was, but probably not in the way you‚Äôre expecting. I don‚Äôt want to bore you with the details, but I‚Äôve never been what you would call a ‚Äònormal‚Äô Venlil, so I think I was more open to the idea of humans wanting to be our friends than most.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that why you signed up for the exchange program?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I was never in the exchange program. I jumped right into their military. Earned me this bad boy for my trouble.‚Äù He rolled up his sleeve to show me what looked like an incredibly expensive prosthetic that went all the way to his shoulder. 

*That confirms it, he was in the Battle for Earth defense fleet. He‚Äôs going to hate you when he finds out. I need to get out of here.*

A paw clasped mine. ‚ÄúRoesh, are you okay?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I squeaked out. ‚ÄúI just need to-‚Äù

He cut me off as he placed his paw on my chest, ‚ÄúRoesh, you‚Äôre having a panic attack. Focus on my voice. I want you to take as deep of a breath as you can and hold it.‚Äù I did as he instructed. ‚ÄúOkay, now slowly let it out. In and hold. Now out.‚Äù We repeated the exercise for a few minutes until I slowly felt my heart rate returning to normal. ‚ÄúThere you go, feeling better?‚Äù

Tears were starting to form in my eyes. This was supposed to be a nice day for Hilsfeer and I was ruining it by being so weak. Again.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay,‚Äù I whispered. 

‚ÄúHey, look at me.‚Äù I did as told. ‚ÄúPanic attacks are nothing to be embarrassed over. I still get them sometimes too.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou do?‚Äù I sniffled. 

‚ÄúYep, it‚Äôs been awhile since my last one, but they can happen to anyone and they have a nasty habit of sneaking up on you if you let them. At least we stopped this one before it got too bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, thanks for that,‚Äù I replied with a soft wag as a chime from above the door caught both of our attention and a tired looking human wandered in. 

‚ÄúOh, there‚Äôs Jacob now. Over here!‚Äù he called out with a wave that the tired human returned. 

‚ÄúMornin‚Äô, Siv,‚Äù he said with a yawn that showed off his teeth far more than I was comfortable with. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs your friend?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is Roesh, and can you pretend to have manners and cover your mouth when you yawn? He‚Äôs still getting used to humans.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah, sorry,‚Äù he said with another yawn, thankfully covering his mouth this time. ‚ÄúI spend so much time around you that I forget not everyone is used to us yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I managed to squeak out, ‚ÄúI need to get comfortable around humans eventually.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrue, but it‚Äôs not one of those things ya need to rush, ya know?‚Äù He looked between us. ‚ÄúYou guys order already?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I got you a coffee as well, hopefully it‚Äôll be out soon. Stars know I need it.‚Äù

‚ÄúSame.‚Äù He moved to sit next to Sivik, who scooted further into the booth to accommodate him. ‚ÄúOur flight getting delayed really fucked us.‚Äù

‚ÄúGod, right?‚Äù Sivik‚Äôs voice was filled with exasperation. ‚ÄúWe can travel between planets in a matter of hours, but we can‚Äôt go between two continents without non-stop delays. Like, I get it was raining but did we really have to sit on the tarmac for three hours?‚Äù

‚ÄúWoulda been nice if my meeting coulda been pushed till tomorrow, but no we just had to meet today at eight AM. What kinda freaks have a meeting first thing in the morning on a Monday?‚Äù

‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt know why this even needed to be done in person.‚Äù

‚ÄúAncient human tradition. Gotta grovel in person when asking for money.‚Äù

The two seemed to forget my presence as they went back and forth for a few more minutes talking about their trip. I was able to gather Jacob worked for a charity to help children displaced by the war, and he was speaking to someone here to try and convince them to help with funding. It sounded like it had gone well at least. I was a little surprised that humans would try and help the children of their former enemies. I figured he was having to beg for funding because most humans were against helping them, but it sounded like the real issue was too many of these organizations had sprouted up so it was more of an issue of proving you were the best one to give money to.

‚ÄúOh, sorry Roesh, we kinda started rambling there, didn‚Äôt we?‚Äù Jacob said with a tired laugh.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, it sounds like you have important things to talk about.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah but it‚Äôs rude of us to do that when we have a guest. Why don‚Äôt you tell us a little about yourself?‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh um, not much to say.‚Äù I ducked my head. ‚ÄúMy husband and I just moved here and we‚Äôre still looking for work. Oh! But he did just have an interview for a teaching job that sounded like it went really well. That‚Äôs actually why I was out this morning. I wanted to make him breakfast to surprise him, and I was stopping here to grab a few of the pastries he loves.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs awfully kind of you,‚Äù Sivik said with a wag. ‚ÄúMy partner made me breakfast in bed for my birthday. Absolutely made my day.‚Äù

‚ÄúPartner, are you two‚Ä¶?‚Äù I started to ask before Sivik cut me off.

‚ÄúStars no!‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt have to sound so against it,‚Äù Jacob laughed.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not even gay, you dumbass,‚Äù Sivik shot back, ‚Äúand I can, and did, do way better.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you that first one, but we both know I am god's gift to women, men, non-binaries, creatures that reproduce asexually-‚Äù

Sivik elbowed him in the side causing me to gasp involuntarily. I knew humans could control their instincts, but surely it was a bad idea to provoke them with violence.

‚ÄúSorry about that, Roesh, but sometimes the only way to get a human to stop is with some good old fashioned percussive maintenance.‚Äù 

‚ÄúPercussive maintenance?‚Äù 

‚ÄúOld human term,‚Äù Jacob answered as he rubbed his side where the Venlil had elbowed him, ‚Äúfor when you fix something by giving it a good ol‚Äô smack.‚Äù

My first instinct was to call the term ‚Äòpredatory‚Äô, but I quickly remembered a few times I had been frustrated with our holopad and given it a light smack on the side in hopes of encouraging it to work faster.

*They‚Äôre just people like us. They‚Äôre just people like us.* 

‚ÄúWell um, if you two aren‚Äôt a pair, why isn‚Äôt your partner here?‚Äù I asked.

I wasn‚Äôt sure if I said something wrong, but they both looked uncomfortable at the mention of Sivik‚Äôs partner. 

‚ÄúHe couldn‚Äôt make it,‚Äù Sivik offered. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a nurse and couldn‚Äôt get the time off with how busy his hospital has been since the head nurse retired. They‚Äôre still looking for her replacement and it‚Äôs been a bit of an organizational shit show over there.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, that makes sense.‚Äù

I still wondered why they seemed hesitant to talk about them. Maybe humans are less accommodating of same sex pairings and they were unsure how I would react? But I already told them I had a husband. Maybe they just missed that?

‚ÄúShame he couldn‚Äôt join you though,‚Äù I continued. ‚ÄúI hate being away from my husband for long.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah, do you need to get back to him?‚Äù Sivik asked, clearly eager to change the subject. ‚ÄúIt sounded like you had an exciting morning planned, we don‚Äôt want to keep you from him.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, he should still be asleep a bit longer,‚Äù I said with a wag as I thought of how cute he had looked with his tongue sticking out slightly as he slept. ‚ÄúI was just waiting for our drinks, then I was going to order a few croissants and be on my way. 

‚ÄúOrder for Sivik,‚Äù the woman behind the counter shouted out as if she had been waiting for her queue. 

‚ÄúPerfect timing.‚Äù Jacob stood up to fetch our drinks. Quickly returning with a drink carrier and a bag that I assumed had my lamington in it. 

‚ÄúRoesh,‚Äù Sivik said before taking a sip of his coffee, ‚ÄúI think we would both like to spend some more time talking with you, but I am fading fast over here. Would you mind if we headed back to our hotel to pass out?‚Äù

Jacob sighed as he took a sip of his drink as well, ‚ÄúGod, yeah, I didn‚Äôt want to be rude since I just got here, but I almost fell asleep talking a few times. It was really nice meeting you, Roesh. I‚Äôd be happy to exchange contact info if you wanna keep in touch.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, s-sure!‚Äù I squeaked out with a wag. 

I did find talking to humans like Rowan a bit easier over text, and having someone like Sivik to talk to who‚Äôd gone through this process already seemed like a good idea, so I quickly swapped info with the pair. They both gave me a tired wave before stepping out of the cafe. I watched them turn and bump into each other. Their voices were muffled through the glass, but I gathered they were arguing which way their hotel was before Sivik eventually pushed Jacob and forced him down the boardwalk.

*I wonder if I‚Äôll ever be comfortable enough around humans to push them around like that?*

The idea of someone like me bossing a predator around was a ridiculous enough idea to give me a small giggle fit in the middle of the cafe. I was glad it was still fairly empty so I didn‚Äôt get too many weird looks. I walked up to the counter and ordered two croissants for Hilsfeer and myself and was on my way back to our home.

The lights were still off when I got back to our house. I quietly opened the front door, straining my ears to see if any sound was coming from the living room, but all was still silent. I crept over to our bedroom, peeking my head inside and confirming my love was still fast asleep where I‚Äôd left him, before sneaking my way back to the kitchen. I diligently followed the instructions Rowan had provided me. Despite how daunting it had sounded when I first read it, the recipe ended up being extremely easy to follow and before I knew it, I had two bowls of oatmeal ready. I quickly topped them with the fruit and a drizzle of honey before sneaking my way back into our bedroom.

Hilsfeer had rolled a bit in his sleep since I last poked my head in. My adorable husband was now positioned on his back with his limbs sprawled out. I decided to get a bit of revenge for his vicious nuzzle attack from Friday and leap on top of him. He gasped out as he was startled awake, but before he could realize the danger he was in, I buried my face into his neck and began my assault. 

‚ÄúR-Roesh. St-stahp!‚Äù he pleaded but I showed him no mercy. ‚ÄúT-this is unfair!‚Äù 

He whined and giggled but I didn‚Äôt relent. My whiskers tickled his neck as he squirmed beneath me. I tickled his sides with my paws to add onto his suffering. I finally accepted his unconditional surrender when tears were pouring from his eyes and he was gasping for air between giggles. 

‚ÄúWhat has gotten into you?‚Äù He laughed as I rolled off of him.

‚ÄúMe? I just couldn‚Äôt resist how cute you look while you‚Äôre sleeping?‚Äù I replied with a mischievous thrash of my tail.

‚ÄúAh, so this is revenge?‚Äù he giggled. ‚ÄúHow long have you been planning this, fiend?‚Äù

I gasped in fake shock, ‚ÄúHilsfeer! I can‚Äôt believe you would accuse me of something like that. This was just a spur of showing affection for my amazing husband who I love more than anything and am incredibly proud of.‚Äù

He squinted at me in suspicion. ‚ÄúWhat do you have planned?‚Äù

I blinked my eyes as cutely as I could muster. ‚ÄúWhy would you ever accuse me of having something planned? I assure you I have no idea what you are talking about. Now if you could just follow me to the kitchen for no particular reason‚Ä¶‚Äù

Hilsfeer giggled again, but hopped down from our bed to follow me. I grabbed his paw, eagerly guiding him through the short walk to our living room. 

‚ÄúTa-da!‚Äù I was practically wiggling as I showed him the bowls of oats I had set on the living room table for us.

‚ÄúRoesh,‚Äù he gasped, ‚Äúwhat is all of this for?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I knew you were nervous for your interview Friday, but it sounded like you did an amazing job so I wanted to celebrate. What do you think?‚Äù I wagged excitedly.

‚ÄúOh love, we don‚Äôt even know if I got it yet‚Ä¶‚Äù He wiped a tear from his eyes.

‚ÄúWell, even if you don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm still incredibly proud of you for putting yourself out there and trying. If it turns out they are too stupid to hire you, well, then consider this a consolation meal.‚Äù

He wrapped his arms around me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I did to deserve you.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, I‚Äôm the one who got lucky to have someone as wonderful as you as my husband.‚Äù I nuzzled into his neck. ‚ÄúNow come on, let‚Äôs eat.‚Äù

The two of us sat down at the living room table. I watched with excitement as my love took his first bite and his eyes lit up with excitement. 

‚ÄúOh my stars, Roesh, where did you get this?‚Äù

‚ÄúI made it!‚Äù I wagged.

‚ÄúYou did?‚Äù I signed ‚Äòyes‚Äô. ‚ÄúWell it is amazing. Thank you so much. Ooo, and you got me another croissant!‚Äù he chirped as he noticed the bag from the cafe, before picking up the cup I had nearly forgotten about. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs called a ‚Äòcappuccino‚Äô, I met someone new at the cafe and he told me I had to try it, but I wanted to wait to share it with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou spoke to a new human?‚Äù He seemed even more amazed by that than the meal I had made.

‚ÄúUm, technically yeah, but the one who told me to get this was a Venlil.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a Venlil living here?‚Äù His ears perked up. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs his name? We should invite him over! I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs overwhelmed too. It would be great for you to have someone-‚Äù

I cut him off, ‚ÄúLove, please, slow down.‚Äù I giggled as he put his head down in embarrassment, ‚ÄúYes I met a Venlil. His name is Sivik, but he‚Äôs only here for a few days with his human friend Jacob. I found him asleep at the cafe and we chatted for a while. It‚Äôs no big deal.‚Äù I could feel a preemptive bloom coming on at the praise I knew he was going to throw on me.

‚ÄúHe was sleeping surrounded by humans?‚Äù I flicked my tail in response. ‚ÄúWow, that‚Äôs impressive. He must be really used to them.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe did say he‚Äôs been here almost a year,‚Äù I kept speaking before Hilsfeer could figure out the implications of when he arrived, ‚ÄúWe exchanged contact info. He said he‚Äôd be happy to give me whatever advice he can about living on Earth. I um, even got his human friends info too.‚Äù 

I didn‚Äôt get to say anything else before I felt my husband‚Äôs arms wrap around me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so proud of you, Roesh,‚Äù he whispered into my ear. 

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù I hugged him back. ‚ÄúNow let‚Äôs give this coffee thing a try before it gets even colder.‚Äù

I watched with anticipation as Hilsfeer took a sip. I wasn‚Äôt quite sure how to read his expression but he seemed to enjoy it, so I reached out and took the cup from him and brought it to my mouth. I took a hesitant sip. The flavor was‚Ä¶strange. There was a bitterness to it that wasn‚Äôt completely unpleasant, but there were also hints of sweetness. I looked back at my husband and saw he had an equally confused look on his face, but he reached out for the cup and took another sip. The two of us slowly finished off the beverage together as we idly chatted over breakfast. Even as I took the last sip, I still wasn‚Äôt completely sure how I felt about the strange liquid. But as a wave of energy began to wash over me, I think I understood why Sivik had spoken so highly of it.

I took a glance over at my husband. His tail was starting to thrash back and forth rapidly. I gave him a knowing look as the two of us came to the same conclusion about how to expend some of this newfound energy flowing through us.",9,1750816258.0,NatureofPredators,4,1.0,False

1ljtbb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1ljtbb0/feeling_disappointed_and_sad/,Feeling Disappointed and Sad,"So, I just walked into a viewing at the local LDS ward building for a lady who is a neighbor who passed away. She used to teach my kids piano lessons. I have not been in the building for at least a year and I recently let key people know that we have left the church. When I walked in, very few people were comfortable talking to me even though I had been active in the LDS community for 20+ years. I felt like the plague. Even the bishop totally avoided me. We had been extremely active members of this ward for many years. I thought we had a lot of good friends in the community. I have now realized that I was wrong. And if I think about it... their fear of me makes sense. The mentality and teachings of the LDS church are so incredibly transactional and fear-based that unconditional love is not actually practiced in this space. When you think about the courts they hold on people (barbaric) and how controlling they are when it comes to your underwear and what you are allowed to put into your body (ie: coffee) and the fact that you need to earn your worth and your right to be loved (which is exhausting) is one of the main points they drill into members of the church.

I feel sad that I am no longer considered a safe person to talk to...which is weird because I am not angry and I truly respect everyone's right to believe and worship. I can now see things from the other side of orthodoxy and have met so many people who are truly kind and non-judgmental. They are standing beside me now, on the outside of a high demand religion which more often than not marginalizes people who are different then they are.

We are the ones on the outside looking in, we are the ones that make everyone uncomfortable like we have a sickness that is contagious and might spread.

Anyway, I left after the viewing so as to not have to listen to the shaming rhetoric reminding me that I am never enough and never will be enough in the LDS space. I don't no why I thought I would walk in and people would love me back into the church...I was foolish to think that!

I once heard someone say, ‚ÄúA cult is an organization that won‚Äôt let you leave with your dignity intact.‚Äù Now that I am on the other side of the cult...I can feel the truth in this statement.",8,1750815992.0,exmormon,3,1.0,False

The taxidermied owl, perched with an unnerving stillness, gazed. Its marble eyes, pits of frozen intensity, pierced the hollow shells of corporate souls below, corporate corpses who yearned to emulate its very stillness, its dead perfection.

These dead-eyed drones, these corporate corpses. Their innards were stuffed with the shredded, indigestible pulp of quarterly reports, their veins coursing with viscous black printer ink, that spilled black blood staining the polished Carrera marble floors. Not with life, but with the cold, precise inscriptions of profit margins and ticker symbols. These were the indelible marks of their essence, the drab monotony of corporate drudgery. The whir of a dying paper shredder, chewing on the hollowness of their being, emanated from the cavity in their chests where a soul should have resided.

Stuffed into cubicles, into the precise, suffocating dimensions of their coffins, they mimicked life without truly living. Their purpose, a grotesque joke, reduced to projecting an illusion of fiscal vitality by performing a pantomime of profitability. They strutted with borrowed quills, like a porcupine desperately trying to appear threatening, oblivious to the utter emptiness they peddled. As empty as a Big Pharma commercial depicting cheerful, idyllic victims of a symposium of somatic savagery, laughing maniacally while their internal organs slowly, chemically failed. Their existence: a paradox of lifelessness masquerading as fulfillment, a taxidermied ambition, its wings forever frozen mid-flap, never meant for flight.

They yearned for a delirious dormancy, a gloam realm where existence was reduced to mere presence. An eternal Taco Tuesday afternoon in a windowless room, where recycled air tasted like sewer gas and silence buzzed like miniature insect drones performing a lobotomy. They craved freedom from the soul-leeching drudgery that served only to stockpile obscene wealth in the subterranean vaults of distant elites, those pale architects preparing for an Armageddon they believed they could buy their way out of. Their fortunes, amassed on a capitalist engine whose overused serpentine belt would inevitably snap from driving an excessive load of broke consumers, leaving them stranded in a world they devoured.

As wealth accumulated in obscuring shadows, beyond the grasp of these corporate drones, they mechanically fed its cancerous growth like fleas on a dying puppy, siphoning the very last drops of vitality from the world, from themselves. Meanwhile, the profit pipeline remained clogged with the accumulation of robust dividends, each one a grotesque pearl formed from human suffering. Elsewhere, unseen, the most vulnerable paid the ultimate price: children with bloated, empty bellies, their dreams reduced to a single, brittle grain of rice, a parched hope dissolving on a dust-choked tongue. Perhaps the rice grain whispered promises of a world that would never be, a final, mocking secret. The air was thick with the unspoken accusations of the dying, a symphony of silence where tiny, distended stomachs rumbled a counter-melody of starvation.

Corporate corpses understood this truth in their desiccated bones: every dividend paid was a dividend in flesh. A macabre, filleted extraction. The faint, sweet scent of chuck roast, long since rotted, levitated perpetually in the air of their air-conditioned purgatory.

They paced office halls, their gaze repeatedly drawn to the taxidermied owl, its stillness a haunting mirror. They dreamed of being taxidermied themselves, to protect their flesh-deficient carcasses, their exposed tendons and ligaments feeling the deep shame of denudity, the raw truth of their consumption. Their defeated footsteps echoed through the sterile halls like the arrhythmic thump of an expiring heart, each step leaving a barely perceptible, grey, dusty outline on the Carrara marble floors. The fluorescent lights above flickered like captive fireflies in a pelican's translucent pouched bill, their incessant buzzing a constant, irritating drone in their ears, a soundtrack to their slow decay.

The taxidermied owl's glassy stare transformed, growing, expanding, as if drinking the very last vestiges of their feeble life force. A subtle sucking sound, almost audible, its beak twitching in synchrony with the flickering lights like a morbid metronome, keeping time with their descent into inertness. A sly smile, switching on and off, keeping the rhythm of delightful death.

Meanwhile, the corporate corpses' faces became molten polymer, their features blurring like cheap CGI, occasionally solidifying into grotesque masks of forced enthusiasm. Their skin sagged into grotesque frowns, masks of perpetual dissatisfaction, sometimes cracking like dried earth when they attempted a smile. They shuffled back to yesterday, attempting a desperate pilgrimage to reclaim lost flesh, their movements leaving faint trails of grey dust. A symphony of scraping despair, punctuated by the occasional wet squelch of decay.

Again, today, they arranged tomorrow's un-held meetings in a newly entered, regressed yesterday. A futile dance with a broken clock, the calendar pages flipping backward with a dry, papery whisper of time unravelling. Coffee cups un-spilled, papers un-printed, and conferences unheld‚Äîthe silence punctuated only by the soft hum of weak synapses, misfiring memories. All while the taxidermied owl became livelier with the fresh flesh supply daily delivered. The sound of muffled footsteps and a wet, dragging sound outside the office door, followed by a faint, sweet, metallic scent of fresh meat. Its feathers rustled with an otherworldly energetic skin, seeming to writhe with an unnatural, stolen vitality, casting faint, shimmering shadows across the sterile walls. In this time-reversed world, powered by consumed ambition, the owl's dead eyes danced with a vitality that seemed to mock the very drudgery of the soulless living, a silent, feathered maestro conducting an orchestra of the damned, its pupils dilating and contracting with unnatural speed. As the clock hands spun counterclockwise, unraveling the threads of their wasted hours, the numbers on the clock face blurring and rearranging themselves into a nonsensical spiral, the owl's presence grew more disturbingly lifelike, its plumage gaining a disturbing sheen, its talons occasionally flexing with phantom strength. The humans around it, conversely, taxidermied desperately into dry skin folds of discontent, their eyes shrinking into vacant pinpricks, their movements becoming jerky and unnatural, like poorly animated automatons, their brittle limbs feeling prone to snapping. The owl was not just observing; it was draining. Every forced smile, every hollow meeting, every discarded ambition was sustenance.

Beyond the office walls, the city streets pulsed with a vibrant, synthetic life. A cacophony of manufactured desires and synthetic delights, the air thick with the cloying smell of manufactured desires. Neon billboards sang siren songs, their garish hues bleeding into the rain-slicked asphalt, their digital eyes following passersby with unsettling intensity, beckoning them to indulge in the latest used-to-be-humans. Their vacant smiles plastered onto mannequins, their limbs posed in gestures of desperate allure, their price tags glowing with an unnatural light, selling them as desirable commodities.

Materia Viva. Materials that had become terrifyingly alive, dancing in the spotlight. Fabrics whispered sweet nothings, their soft rustle like the sigh of discarded lovers, occasionally forming coherent, seductive phrases of consumerist bliss. Metals gleamed with seductive allure, their cold sheen reflecting the hungry gleam in vacant eyes, sometimes vibrating with an inner hum of self-importance. And plastics shimmered like diamonds, refracting light into a thousand tiny, soulless sparks, their surfaces occasionally rippling with unseen, predatory energy. A gleaming sports car, a predator in chrome, pouted on the sidewalk, its predatory grin, its headlights blinking with impatient desire. Its paint job flawless, its engine purring contentedly, a guttural rumble of self-satisfaction, the scent of leather and exhaust fumes a heady perfume, occasionally emitting a low, possessive growl, daring anyone to own it. Nearby, a designer handbag sashayed down the street, its faux-crocodile skin twitching imperceptibly, its clasp occasionally snapping open and shut with a hungry click, as if sharing a secret about the emptiness it contained, sometimes emitting a faint, high-pitched giggle of superiority.

Amidst the throngs of Materia Viva, humans had become mere accessories, living mannequins with hollow eyes, their clothing slightly askew, background props to the star-studded cast of vivacious materials. Their muted colors a stark contrast to the neon brilliance, their stillness a stark contrast to the energetic, almost violent movements of the objects. The Materia Viva had built a society of pure acquisition, where sentience was granted by price tag and purpose by possession. They valued flawless surfaces, eternal newness, and the endless accumulation of their own kind, treating the ""used-to-be-humans"" as disposable servants.

As one Materia Viva shopper, a gleaming chrome automaton, cooed over a glittering used-to-be-human, its chest glowing with an ad for the latest gadget‚Äîa pulsating advertisement where a heart used to beat, the digital voiceover promising fleeting happiness‚Äîthe carcass's taxidermied frame whispered to its companion, another used-to-be-human, 'I'm feeling very energetic, a brittle, forced enthusiasm, their jaw moving with a stiff, unnatural click. When can we upgrade to higher-class servants for Materia Viva‚Äîthose with slightly less vacant stares, perhaps ones that can still perform simple tasks, or hold a conversation beyond consumer slogans?'

The used-to-be-human replied, its voice a dry rustle of forgotten aspirations, 'Don't worry, darling, we'll both be replaced soon by other used-to-be-humans. Our essence will be recycled into the next disposable trend, our memories fading like old television static. We can recycle eternally. A chilling promise of endless servitude, our constituent atoms rearranged into new forms of desirable commodities, forever serving the unceasing hunger of Materia Viva.'

Deep beneath the surface, the Earth's crust seethed with a growing discontent. Its ancient bones groaned under the weight of their folly, the tectonic plates shifting with increasing agitation. Eons of pollution, exploitation, and desecration had taken their toll, and the planet was feverish, its ancient heartbeat beginning to falter. The land trembled with rage, a low, guttural rumble beneath their oblivious feet, occasionally erupting in minor tremors that the Materia Viva dismissed as ""exciting new vibrations"" for new product launches. The oceans churned with resentment, their depths a swirling vortex of toxic tears, the waves crashing against the shore with unusual violence, spitting plastic foam onto the beaches. And the magma turbulated with an increasing urgency, a subterranean boil threatening to erupt, the ground radiating an unnatural heat.

The Earth, a gargantuan, living entity, no longer merely trembled; it whispered, a promise rising from its molten core, carried on the faintest seismic waves: ""The time of reckoning is beneath your feet."" It had watched the corporate corpses feed their wealth, had felt the Materia Viva consume its very skin. It felt the weight of their unfulfilled potential, a suffocating blanket poisoning its bedrock. Its voice, a primeval groan, became a roar: ""The surface world, with its plastic-suffocated seas and smoke-choked skies, will soon be swallowed whole! Engulfed in a fiery, primordial burp, the screams of the Materia Viva drowned out by the roar of the Earth. The lava flows will cleanse my skin, purging the detritus of humanity's destructive legacy, scouring the planet's surface clean of humanity's toxic, petrified remains, leaving behind a sterile, glowing landscape.""

Taxidermied Earth. Its crust stretched taut like dried skin, the mountains like brittle bones, a monument to human folly.

The planet's core pulsed with a gathering fury, a rhythmic throb growing louder with each wasted breath above, a countdown to planetary catharsis. Its patience worn thin by the endless stream of toxic waste, used-to-be-humans carcasses, and discarded dreams. Materia Viva, oblivious to the danger brewing beneath their feet, lost in the gleam of their own manufactured desires, their conversations shallow and focused on the acquisition of more things, continued their destructive dance‚Äîa frantic, materialistic jig, their laughter echoing with a hollow, tinny sound. Unaware of the abyss that yawned open, ready to consume them all. A fiery maw promising oblivion, the first tendrils of molten rock already beginning to crack the pavement.

The taxidermied owl, from its corporate perch, now seemed to smile wider, its once-glassy eyes reflecting the orange glow of the rising magma. It had witnessed the exchange, the gradual draining of human essence into the very materials they worshipped. It had seen their taxidermy, their transformation into commodities, even before the Earth claimed them. The owl was not just a symbol; it was the herald of the ultimate recycling, the collector of spent souls, and the silent, feathered witness to the planet's final, glorious tantrum. Its beak twitched, no longer with the flickering lights, but with the rhythmic, satisfying pulse of the Earth's vengeful heart.",1,1750815721.0,Unstyle,0,1.0,False
1ljt820,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/1ljt820/what_do_i_have_what_can_i_do/,What do I have + what can I do?,"So, for context I live in, essentially, the country 15 minutes from a small town. 

There's hardly anything to do. 35 minutes away there's a bigger town/city? where I work/sometimes go there to do stuff. 

Though, I've been driving every once a week/two weeks (depending on the week), to a bigger city. The drive is a mininum 1hr 35min one way. So basically 3+ hrs in total. 

I do this because I've been longing to do anything. I mean sure I could go to places near me but I like to socialize or be where people are (more people/a lot of people). I like to see their faces, see how humans interact, etc. 

So I've been going to these big cities, and spend that day at coffee shops, shopping, going to parks, eating from local places there. 

However, when I'm not there or not working. I literally am not motivated to do anything. I feel almost empty because I can't do anything with anyone, even at the big cities I drive to, as I have no friends. 

I have literally forced myself to be a member in things at my church, or work 30+ hrs at work, because if I don't I know will stay home and just feel sorry for myself. 

I usually workout too, 5 days a week (I haven't the last 2 weeks cuz I did something to my back ü´†). 

I do feel sad sometimes, and I'm ashamed to say to stop from feeling anything I will continuously have a video either playing, or be listening to a long podcast (3+ hrs, usually in theology so that's helps me a bit lol), read, or scrolling Instagram (this one has gotten progressively worst). 
Also I've been wanting to get back to college, but I've had to take a semester off because I still have to pay for the semester before that. I was looking forward to going back in the fall, but with all the money I owe I might have to wait ANOTHER semester. The people I went to highschool with all graduated this year and that was low-key a stab to the gut (I took a gap year after hs, separate thing from this semester).

I'm frustrated I can't socialize, or hang out with friends/bf (cuz I don't have any), I can't go to the populated areas I like except like 3 times month (maybe less), and I can't go back to college. 

Essentially the lack of communication (no friends, in fact I don't think I've ""hung out"" with anyone as a friend in 3 1/2 years--- it's definitely getting to me.... before I could control my emotions and now the toll is hitting me like a train) and lack of people everywhere/ lack of things to do near me is driving me insane. 

Some days I do feel that I'm slowly loosing empathy, which is what I want to NOT happen. 

Also I thought I should add this, sometimes I feel I'll die early, others day I feel I'll live a full live. I don't know what my mind is trying to tell me XD. 

So what can I do to help my brain not just rot away in my room ü´†ü´†ü´†. ",2,1750815721.0,TooAfraidToAsk,0,1.0,False

1ljt4a9,https://www.reddit.com/r/PreCervicalCancer/comments/1ljt4a9/positive_leep_story_cin23/,Positive Leep Story Cin2/3," 
I am 32yrs old. I have always had routine normal paps until my recent one in December came back abnormal. I was told I high risk for Cin 2/3 and would need a colposcopy. I immediately went into a spiral and dealt with all sorts of anxiety asking how and why. Especially because my husband and I were just starting to try for pregnancy. 
I went forward with the Colposcopy in January- no anesthesia. To be honest it was bearable, Pain during the procedure was not bad at all. More so just a very uncomfortable and a fairly quick procedure. I will say 1-2 days after the Colposcopy the aches and pains felt like some just kicked me as hard as they could. Hurt to sit but eventually went away. The bleeding was minimal what freaked me out more was the rusty color/ coffee grounds every time you wiped & Monsel solution-the skin like pieces that come out of you from the bandage.  (Which they did not warn me about) 
My biopsy from my colposcopy did come back positive for high grade CIN2/3. 
Fast forward to March I went through with the LEEP procedure‚Äî my main concern to my doctor was we were wanting to start a family and I wanted to avoid a CONE. 
I went through with my LEEP on March 17 under twilight (which I highly recommend or GA). Not a comfortable procedure to be awake for. It was quick and the recovery was in my opinion better than the Colposcopy. Pain afterward was minimal, bleeding was minimal. The Monsel solution comes out of you again and the coffee grounds substance. 
I waited 4 weeks for recovery no sexual activity, tampons etc. to be fully healed. 
Quickly after the 4 weeks I found out I was PREGNANT! 
I recently had my first prenatal appointment and another PAP was done. 
Of course triggered from going through all that I was so afraid it was still going to come back abnormal. 
I received my results today and my PAP came back NORMAL- NEGATIVE HPV 
I was SOOO relieved! 
I did take EGCG, a mushroom blend and a high end multivitamin everyday after I found out of was high grade. Clean diet. 
I do believe that helped my body fight this off and having faith I would get through this. Now looking forward to a healthy happy pregnancy!

Temp: depends, but I‚Äôm just off boil with light roast

Add 270g of water just off the boil, add the plunger and give it a slight pull up to create your vacuum, and then let steep for 5 mins. At the 5 min mark, give it a slight swirl, let sit for 30 seconds, and then press over the ice. 

Add 1-2 additional ice cubes to chill the drink even further, and enjoy!

We both work for the school district and since summer has started I've been out of work and he picked up a job with before and after care at his school and is tutoring one of his students. I just started helping his grandfather with a family business just so I can get some sort of income while working from home and ubering on the side as well.  So far I do all the laundry, dishes, bathroom cleaning, dusting and vacuuming. I usually ask for help with the laundry or cleaning up after certain pets and I'm told he will do it later and when months go by and I say I'll do it myself he gets upset that I have a huge list for him and he just wants a day to relax. I'm worried that when the baby comes it's going to be me doing everything. I asked for some help with the laundry the other day and it turned into an argument about what else am I going to do when I'm home alone with a baby and on maternity leave. It hurt me because I said we were partners and I shouldn't feel like I'm the one holding my weight around the house. This was a issue before I became pregnant and now its getting to the point where he's crying saying I'm not supporting him and I'm hurting him by saying he's not doing enough. I tell him I appreciate him and how hard he works for financially supporting us right now and it doesn't seem to matter. He says I don't show it enough so I make sure to wake up extra early make his coffee before he wakes up, make him a good lunch to take to work with a note in it and I'll have dinner ready when he comes home, but anytime I ask for help with a chore he gets upset and talks to me like I'm hurting him when I'm explaining the help I need.

So I have been researching but I am struggling to find the best place for me to move. Especially in this climate!! I grew up in Indiana, spent my adulthood in the PNW, and now at 30 I'm ready to find a new home. The reason being is it's crazy expensive, I want more of a BIPOC community, and I'm tired of the grind culture.

\*\*\*\* NOTE: I have 2 destination weddings, rent for 2 months, a trip to my hometown, and just surviving so I don't have money to check out places before moving. Sight unseen is crazy which is why I want to be as informed as possible.

What I'm looking for...

  \* Blue! - I was born in a republican bible belt state and lived as an adult in a liberal progressive state. I don't want to go backwards. Especially now!

  \* Community - Seattle is full of group friends, meaning you have a group for nights out, fitness classes, brunch, etc.. I would love to be more connected. I have Black and Latino friends but they're spread across other groups so we don't hang out regularly.

  \* Affordability - I had a 600 sqft 1 bed, which was basically a studio, for $2400 for reference. There's liquor and sugar tax. A bag of chips costs $6 if not on sale.

  \* Transportation - Will be car-less for at least 6 months. Need walkable neighborhoods with grocery stores, coffee shops, restaurants, bars, and a library, preferably)

  \* Nightlife - My club life is once a quarter max lol. I love comedy clubs, open mics, live music, and really any live performance

  \* Weather - I hate ice and extreme heat, but am open if my other needs are met

  \* Crime - I'm not a stranger to it, but I'd obviously prefer a place where I don't have to stress more than what I already do as a black woman.

I know that was a lot but context matters.

I'm a Lakehead University Georgian College partnership grad (Electrical Engineering) and figured I'd introduce myself while offering to help with any tech headaches people might have because my job search efforts have been pretty rough so far.

I know moving somewhere new can be tough, so I'm trying to be useful to the community while I settle in. If anyone's dealing with:

* Computer acting up or won't start
* Lost important files/photos (data recovery is kind of my thing)
* Need patient help teaching your older relatives their phone or tablet
* Virus/malware issues
* Academic tutoring for engineering, math, physics, chemistry
* And any thing else in-between

I'm happy to help out. I bike and will be learning the transit system so I can come to you, and I'm pretty laid back about explaining tech stuff without judgement.

Also just genuinely looking to meet cool people in the area. What are the best spots to hang out? Good coffee shops for working? Any local tech meetups or just general groups for people in their 20s?

Still figuring out the city but loving it so far. Hit me up if you need tech help or just want to chat about Guelph recommendations.

1ljssjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ljssjj/coworker_stuck_in_a_love_triangle/,Co-worker stuck in a love triangle,"I have become close to a co-worker at my job for context we are both women. She‚Äôs a lovely person and I feel we‚Äôve become great friends overtime. 

She recently shared that she is extremely stressed about her life as she is in her mid-twenties and dealing with a lot of life altering questions in regards to marriage, kids and what she wants to do in life. She told me a while back that she had a partner (male mid 30‚Äôs) who she has been with for 3 years this month. 

The relationship has been tumultuous and they‚Äôve had massive downs rather than ups. She said casually that he isn‚Äôt really her type looks wise but only height wise. He genuinely seems like a decent guy from the sound of it family oriented, loyal and somewhat giving. 
She‚Äôs struggled quite a lot financially and otherwise but the relationship was still there and her partner helped her in whatever capacity he could not always though. 

On her part she‚Äôs found it difficult to commit completely because of their opposing attitudes, philosophical ideas and (he‚Äôs right and she‚Äôs left) political differences. Long story short the guy is decent. Their sex life has been troublesome and he‚Äôs wanted to have more sex and she really hasn‚Äôt been up for it. So I would say that one of the few red flags he has would be that he‚Äôs wanted to have sex often and pressured her to have more sex even in times she didn‚Äôt want to but she did just to make him happy and not cause tensions in the relationship. He‚Äôs even brought up the lack of sex to try and break up or at times he‚Äôs just completely shutting down and dejected. 

She says overtime it‚Äôs just been attachment that has kept them together. Neither of them are very happy with the relationship but are attached and used to one another. He‚Äôs said at several times in the relationship that he isn‚Äôt happy. She‚Äôs always been the one making amends. 

Anyway, recently she came in and told me she ran into an ex/situationship. She and this guy were in contact years back and they talked alot up till the duration when she was about to come to his state. They had an argument a couple days prior and he cut all connection off. They were genuinely into each other and hoped to be united together when she moved here. She was heartbroken due to the situation but he did help her find accommodation for when she did. Anyway, she ran into this guy again and turns out he‚Äôs moved to her area they‚Äôve been in no contact for a long time. He reached out to her once again and they‚Äôve been chatting. She says he wants to be in a relationship with her and that seeing her meant something. His life has been terrible in the last couple years and his living condition isn‚Äôt great and he‚Äôs trying to work his way out of it. To me this seems disastrous in terms of going for him as opposed to someone with absolute stability in life (her current partner). 
She is perplexed because this guy is completely her type minus the instability he‚Äôs going through with his life and living situation at the moment. She says he and her are exactly like each other and are super compatible as people. Although she‚Äôs resorted to being just friends with him and nothing more. 

She can‚Äôt help but wonder what if? But despite that she values stability as well because her time here hasn‚Äôt exactly been very stable and she‚Äôs still working towards it. He is loyal and wanted a relationship from the jump. He‚Äôs someone who‚Äôs worked fairly hard but hasn‚Äôt created a stable career for himself basically has alot of trauma from family etc. Doesn‚Äôt have his dad anymore, he comes from an abusive household and his father died of alcoholism therefore he doesn‚Äôt drink much and even when he does it‚Äôs something very light. His mother‚Äôs been his rock and been the only close family he‚Äôs had. He loves his mother a lot too. 

He‚Äôs extremely smart and intelligent in most ways and on top of that looks wise exactly what she‚Äôs attracted to. She‚Äôs wildly attracted to him from the way she talks about him but the situation holds her back. She did meet to catch up over a coffee and met each other for the first time. This was suppose to be a short meeting but ended up hours long as they talked a lot. He was a gentleman throughout the meeting and told her about how crazy life‚Äôs been the past few years. Not sure one should do in a situation like this. Should she stick to her partner? Or go for the man she liked 5 years back who‚Äôs popped back into her life?

If you want it to actually work ‚Äî whether for sirtuin activation, antioxidant support, or any longevity benefit ‚Äî **take it with food that contains fat.** Doesn‚Äôt need to be a full meal. Even something like coffee with cream, eggs, nuts, or avocado is enough to boost absorption.

Another tip: timing matters. Most researchers and biohackers suggest **taking resveratrol in the morning** since it interacts with circadian rhythms and sirtuin pathways that are more active during the day.

Taking it without food? Honestly, you're just wasting it.

**TL;DR:**

* **Take resveratrol with food that has fat.**
* Empty stomach = poor absorption.

My fiance and I are moving into our first apartment together. We underestimated how much space our living room is and how awkward it is width wise lol. Our living room's floorplan is 17'-4"" x 10'-1"". We have a counter/island that's making the layout really awkward. The space between the counter and the parallel wall is about 90"", perhaps a bit more but I can't remember off the top of my head. We both have two different visions of how the apartment can be set up.

My idea (couch in the middle) - The benefit of this layout is that the living room and dining room are separated, and I feel like the room flows better this way. This would limit us to a smaller couch \~80"" wide sectional, and might be too tight of a squeeze between the couch and counter to get to the dining area. Our coffee table is roughly 2ftx4ft, and our TV stand (black thing) fits a max 65in TV on it.

His idea (couch against the wall) - This would allow us to get a slightly bigger couch (up to 100""), but our TV will have to be much bigger in order to see it from the other side of the room, so in this scenario we would mount the TV on the wall. The only awkward thing for me is having the dining table right in our view of the TV.

We both really want to have a dining table...so we'd prefer not to just get rid of it.  
We'd appreciate any help on this! TIA!

Resveratrol interacts with your **circadian rhythm and sirtuins**, the genes linked to cellular repair, metabolism, and longevity. Studies suggest resveratrol activates these pathways more effectively **in the morning**, when your body‚Äôs repair mechanisms are naturally ramping up.

Why not at night? Some research hints it might disrupt sleep in certain people because it stimulates mitochondrial function and metabolism ‚Äî not exactly what you want before bed.

Plus, resveratrol is better absorbed when taken with some dietary fat ‚Äî coffee with cream, avocado toast, eggs‚Ä¶ whatever fits.

The longevity crowd who stacks NMN with resveratrol? Same deal. **Morning with food = best shot at bioavailability and sync with your body‚Äôs natural repair cycle.**

**TL;DR:**

* **Take resveratrol in the morning.**
* **With food (fat helps absorption).**
* Works synergistically with circadian biology and sirtuin activation.
