1md56c7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1md56c7,Need advice re design and how-to and etc for this coffee table,"Hi all!

I got this old coffee table for free. I like it. But i want to get it fixed and change its colour. It’s too dark to my taste.

1. I cannot tell if this is solid wood or veneer.
2. Is it possible/feasible to repaint inside the coffee table without taking it apart?
3. If I cannot repaint the inside part, any recommended design/colour?

Thank you for your advice very much in advance!

*****
> Stock futures were inched higher Wednesday as investors analyzed earnings reports and awaited the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500 were up marginally, while Nasdaq-100 futures advanced 0.2%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures added 20 points.
*****
> Starbucks shares climbed 4% after the coffee chain posted stronger-than-expected revenue for the third fiscal quarter. On the other hand, Visa slipped 2% despite quarterly results coming in better than what Wall Street expected. Shares of Meta Platforms and Microsoft were marginally higher in the premarket ahead of quarterly results due out after the closing bell.
*****
> Wednesday’s action follows a losing day on the Street, marking the first session of the last seven in which the S&P 500 did not close at an all-time high. The S&P 500 slid 0.3% on Tuesday, while the Dow and Nasdaq Composite lost about 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively.
*****
> The major averages were weighed down as the progress of U.S. trade talks with China became shaky. U.S. negotiators ended discussions with Beijing, and the potential extension of a pause on higher China tariffs remained uncertain. A postponement of these higher rates won’t be final until President Donald Trump signs off on the plan, U.S. negotiators said.
*****
> Investors are awaiting the Federal Reserve’s interest rate announcement Wednesday afternoon. Fed funds futures are pricing in a nearly 98% likelihood of the central bank keeping its key rate at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
> “Despite increased political scrutiny, Fed Chair Jerome Powell continues to signal patience around any interest rate decision,” said Jerry Tempelman, vice president of fixed income research at Mutual of America Capital Management. “Financial markets do not anticipate any change in monetary policy from the Federal Reserve until at least September.”
*****
> Following the decision, traders will turn to a press conference with Powell for insights into the path of monetary policy. This comes as President Trump and allies have tried to pressure the central bank leader to bring the borrowing cost down.
*****
> Before that, traders will monitor economic data on private payrolls, gross domestic product and pending home sales due in the morning.
*****
> They’ll also follow the continued stream of earnings reports. Etsy will provide its quarterly results before the bell on Wednesday, followed by Ford and Robinhood after the market close.

He was explaining how he makes a steady income online sounded like it didn’t take much effort.

I wasn’t trying to eavesdrop or anything, but I caught the phrase: “...at first I thought it was a scam, but then I actually withdrew the money.” That got my attention. I googled a few keywords, followed some links, and ended up on a post by \[u/dtanmango\], where he breaks everything down in detail.

I figured I’d give it a try. Worst case, I waste an hour—no big deal. But then... it worked. I stuck with it, and now I’m making around $200 a day. Honestly, didn’t expect that at all.

I’m not the type to post about stuff like this, but hey maybe someone out there is just scrolling through their feed, waiting for coffee, same as I was.

That’s it. Thanks for reading.",6,1753878177.0,ledgerwallet,2,0.65,False

1md54zr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_whypotato2123/comments/1md54zr/the_weaver_kenji_part_19_the_second_brick/,"The Weaver & Kenji Part 19: The Second Brick (Community, Action, Ripple Effect, Hope)","In the week that followed, Kenji’s apartment transformed. The despair of his job search was replaced by the vibrant, focused energy of creation. His drafting table was covered with detailed plans for the community garden: irrigation layouts, planting schedules, cost estimates for materials he couldn't afford. A beautiful, final rendering of the completed park, a small jewel of green and life, was taped to his wall, a testament to his self-defined purpose.

But when the last line was drawn and the last detail was finalized, a new kind of frustration set in. The creative act, the ""pushing of the boulder,"" had given him meaning. But now the boulder sat at the bottom of a new hill. He had a perfect blueprint for a better world, but as a single, unemployed man, he had no power, no capital, and no influence to make it real.

The Weaver, ever-observant, noted the shift from the positive 'flow state' to this new, agitated stasis.

*“The creative phase is complete,”* it noted, its voice a neutral hum in his mind. *“The project now requires political and material capital, which you do not possess. The probability of implementation is low. How do you intend to proceed?”*

The Weaver was right. The logic was sound. Kenji felt the old, familiar despair begin to creep back in. He had laid his one, perfect brick, but what good was it if it just sat alone in the mud?

He looked at his phone, remembering the coffee with Alex, the simple warmth of not being alone. He had leaned on his ""internal wall"" of integrity; now, he needed to test if there were external ones. He made the call.

“Hey, Alex,” he said when his friend picked up. “You busy? No, no crisis. It’s… something else. I’ve been working on a project. I know it’s a little crazy, but I just want to show it to someone. Are you free for a coffee?”

An hour later, in a small, bustling coffee shop, Alex stared at Kenji’s laptop screen, his expression one of genuine awe. The 3D renderings of the garden glowed with life.

“Kenji… this is incredible,” Alex said, looking from the screen to his friend. “You did all of this… for free?”

Kenji explained his new philosophy, about choosing his own boulder, about laying his own brick true. Alex listened intently, a thoughtful look on his face.

“That derelict lot by the old post office,” Alex said slowly. “Is that the spot you designed this for?”

Kenji nodded.

A slow grin spread across Alex’s face. “My Aunt Sarah is on the neighborhood council. For months, she’s been complaining that they don’t have the funds or the vision to do anything with that exact space. She needs to see this.”

The following Saturday, Kenji found himself at the same coffee shop, but this time, his laptop was angled towards three other people: Alex, his sharp, energetic Aunt Sarah, and a quiet older man she introduced as a retired contractor named George.

Kenji, nervous but filled with the passion of his project, walked them through the design. George squinted at the screen, humming thoughtfully. “The pump for that fountain will be expensive, but I know a supplier who owes me a favor. We could get it at cost.”

Sarah nodded, her eyes bright with excitement. “If we can show the council a viable, low-cost plan with community support, we can get the city to sign off on it. I can bring this up at the next meeting.”

The Weaver was silently processing this new, complex interaction. `Log: The Host's initial unilateral investment, previously deemed illogical, has acted as a catalyst. It has inspired reciprocal, non-obligatory investment of social and material capital from other humans. A decentralized cooperative network is forming in response to the initial act.`

Kenji walked home from the meeting, the cool air feeling fresh and new. Nothing was certain, no ground had been broken. But the project was no longer just his. The weight was no longer his alone to bear. He got back to his apartment and looked at the drawing on his wall. It wasn’t just a dream anymore. It was a plan.

*The boulder is still heavy,* he thought, a slow, hopeful smile spreading across his face. *But for the first time… I’m not the only one pushing.*",1,1753878141.0,u_whypotato2123,0,1.0,False

# [Stock futures are little changed as investors analyze earnings, await Fed rate decision: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/29/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were inched higher Wednesday as investors analyzed earnings reports and awaited the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500 were up marginally, while Nasdaq-100 futures advanced 0.2%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures added 20 points.
*****
> Starbucks shares climbed 4% after the coffee chain posted stronger-than-expected revenue for the third fiscal quarter. On the other hand, Visa slipped 2% despite quarterly results coming in better than what Wall Street expected. Shares of Meta Platforms and Microsoft were marginally higher in the premarket ahead of quarterly results due out after the closing bell.
*****
> Wednesday’s action follows a losing day on the Street, marking the first session of the last seven in which the S&P 500 did not close at an all-time high. The S&P 500 slid 0.3% on Tuesday, while the Dow and Nasdaq Composite lost about 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively.
*****
> The major averages were weighed down as the progress of U.S. trade talks with China became shaky. U.S. negotiators ended discussions with Beijing, and the potential extension of a pause on higher China tariffs remained uncertain. A postponement of these higher rates won’t be final until President Donald Trump signs off on the plan, U.S. negotiators said.
*****
> Investors are awaiting the Federal Reserve’s interest rate announcement Wednesday afternoon. Fed funds futures are pricing in a nearly 98% likelihood of the central bank keeping its key rate at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
> “Despite increased political scrutiny, Fed Chair Jerome Powell continues to signal patience around any interest rate decision,” said Jerry Tempelman, vice president of fixed income research at Mutual of America Capital Management. “Financial markets do not anticipate any change in monetary policy from the Federal Reserve until at least September.”
*****
> Following the decision, traders will turn to a press conference with Powell for insights into the path of monetary policy. This comes as President Trump and allies have tried to pressure the central bank leader to bring the borrowing cost down.
*****
> Before that, traders will monitor economic data on private payrolls, gross domestic product and pending home sales due in the morning.
*****
> They’ll also follow the continued stream of earnings reports. Etsy will provide its quarterly results before the bell on Wednesday, followed by Ford and Robinhood after the market close.

I was diagnosed with high risk HPV April 2024. They also found ASCUS. All of my paps before were clear. I am a very type A person and I take care of my health and get all the check ups every year. 
They said we should wait because I was only 25. So we waited 6 months and I also got the vaccine during those 6 months. (It wasn't a thing back when I was younger so that's why I didn't get it.. I live in a country where the vaccination started pretty late compared to America). 
After the 6 months and 3 doses of the vaccine they found LSIL. So they said let's wait another 6 months and also let's get a colposcopy done. The doctor that did my colpo and biopsy said it looks like CIN1 to her and that I shouldn't worry. She called my 10 days later horrified that it's mostly CIN2 with some CIN3. So that stressed me out even more. Currently I we are waiting 4 more moths to see if it's gonna regress or not and if not I am having a LEEP. 
BUT NOW THE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS...
Guys,.when I say I tried everything I am seriously not lying. 
I don't smoke, I don't drink. I am vegan, I move.my body everyday. I sleep a lot. I don't eat junk food I don't drink sweet drink or more than 2 cups of coffee per day. 
I take every single supplement there is... I take vaginal HPV tablets and papilicare gel. I take vaginal probiotics and oral probiotics. I drink my own combucha everyday. I've been with the same person for 2 years and we use condoms. I spent so much money on my health yet it's only getting worse... I am positive for more than one high risk but 16 and 18 negative. 
Anyone else with a similar experience? 
What am I doing wrong? 
I can't enjoy my life because all I can think of is cancer.. I am managing my stress as much as I can but it's not easy.. I used to have a lot of vaginal and urological issues few years ago and sometimes I still get them and I don't understand why is my body doing this to me... I don't get sick often unless it's some kind of vaginal issues or a UTI. I don't know what is wrong with me ... I feel like a failure.. like I can't be normal for some reason.. and I am scared of getting cancer.

1md52r3,https://i.redd.it/gso56nsn70gf1.jpeg,What happened to my families at that night Nehase 16,"I’m the youngest in my family. I have an older sister and an older brother, and I live with both of my parents. As part of our Ethiopian Orthodox Christian tradition, we always observe special holy days — especially those honoring God, Saint Mary, the angels, and other saints. This includes lighting candles, praying, and performing coffee ceremonies.

On Nehase 16, a holy day dedicated to Saint Mary, we usually light candles and honor her. But this time, somehow, we all completely forgot to do it.

That night, something very unusual happened. My sister came home from work feeling nauseous and had stomach pain. My mother suddenly developed a fever and strong headache. She went to bed early, which is very unlike her. My father had a fever, headache, and signs of physical weakness. My older brother also had fever and headache.

All four of them got sick at the same time — with similar symptoms. But I, the youngest, was totally fine. I didn’t feel even a little sick. I actually felt peaceful.

Later in the evening, everyone started connecting what happened to the fact that we didn’t honor Saint Mary that day like we always do. They believed that forgetting to light the candle and skipping the tradition caused this sudden sickness.

That was the first time something like this had ever happened to us, and all on the same night. From their perspective, it wasn’t just a coincidence.

So if anyone has experienced such special things before share it with me and i would like to know the meaning!

**Fitness** – These days it's mostly weight training, but I still jump into a soccer game when I can. I used to work as a personal trainer, so it’s been part of my life for a while.

   - Most platforms offer affiliate programs. Post about your experiences, drop those links, and watch the commissions roll in.  
   - Bonus points if you mix in quirky reviews or use memes—you know how we love those! 😂

4. **Consulting** 🤓

1md50gm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1md50gm,Swerl coffee - Huye Natural,"Hello everyone,

On my trip to Europe, I bought a bag from Swerl in a local coffee shop.

As an internationally known brand, I wanted to share my review as I don't see much Swerl name around here. And if I am lucky, maybe some of you have the same coffee and would be nice to share their review.

My bag was roasted 7 weeks ago, but the only information I read about Swerl coffee resting time was on ""sigma"" website, saying those coffees peak at 8-12 weeks (what do you think?). I thought the beans would be lighter than the one I buy from my different local roasters but I doesn't seems to be the case (maybe because they are natural). After opening the bag (by the way great quality one way valve), the smell was great and fresh. The beans smells a little closer to fermented coffee. A real natural coffee i would say.

So I brew it on a V60, cafec abaca, 92 degree, 16gr/240ml, Pietro size 8, bloom 30 sec + 2. 

I got a great result, with a spicy chocolate taste (like those spicy speciality chocolate - clove, cardamon), a nice sweetness, a little bit of acidity, o really long brown sugary aftertaste. Great body too.

1md4z1u,https://i.redd.it/4ko8cazl60gf1.png,The Future of IndyCar — How to Compete with F1 & NASCAR,">*This article was originally posted on July 25, under a slightly different title.  This version includes two stat corrections, two new paragraphs, a few other new thoughts, plus some stylistic and organizational changes.  In other words, it has been improved.*

Welcome to [**Open-Wheel Madness**](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWheelMadness/).  By no means an expert, I want to start things off in this community by sharing my thoughts on IndyCar and Formula One (and NASCAR to a lesser degree), and I am hoping to generate a productive discussion about how Indy can improve (and F1, for that matter).  I enjoy learning as much as teaching, and this article features a lot of my opinions, so feel free to disagree and educate, but please do not sue me.      

I know that some Brits may be offended by me putting punctuation inside quotes.  Well, 250 years ago, we Americans fought a war over things like that.  Deal with it.  Plus, there are a ton of other things in this article to be offended by.  Lastly, I also still use two spaces after a period, but I am trying very hard to break that insidious habit.  So, that’s all good.  

Lights out and away we go!

# Comparing IndyCar to Formula One

I am a huge fan of both Indy and F1, and if I had to pick, I think that I would go with Indy — probably, maybe?  For me, I like the fact that anyone starting as far back as 20th on the grid can finish on the podium.  I enjoy that Indy, in general, is far less sanitized than F1.  There is more car contact, more passing, fewer penalties, less whining, and more access to drivers, who, in turn, are generally more open and playful with the media.  Indy teams are more like a family, whereas F1 drivers do not appear to have much love for their teammates (the F1 Movie was laughable in this sense).  Sometimes, F1 drivers come off as spoiled brats, especially when they whinge about competitors who drive with their elbows out or miniscule rule violations.  I hate it when the focus of an F1 race comes down to rule interpretations and infinitesimal measurements that unlikely affected the end results; there is a saying about officiating in basketball that often enters my mind at those times — “Just let them play!”  Then again, when [**Will Power**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Power) (not my pun) pushes another car around the track like a snowplow in Anchorage, he probably does deserve some type of penalty.  

IndyCar, to me, actually appears to be more challenging for drivers, who have to deal with far more immoveable walls, bumpy, rough, uneven tarmacs, and a huge variation in track types, all WITHOUT power steering.  I’m not remotely saying that [**Alex Palou**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81lex_Palou) is better than [**Max Verstappen**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen).  I do think that Palou could be competitive in F1, but I think his main strength, much like his wiley teammate [**Scott Dixon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Dixon), is playing the long game, which isn’t overly helpful in F1, where race outcomes are greatly determined on Saturday.  I do firmly believe that Max is far superior to [**Kyle Lawson**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson)**,** who has [claimed that he’s the better driver](https://www.on3.com/pro/news/kyle-larson-doubles-down-on-max-verstappen-comments-addresses-detractors/) — pick any car on any track with an actual tarmac, Max would likely win even if he spotted Lawson a lap or two.  

Compared to IndyCar, or NASCAR for that matter, F1 driving is much more on point and precise, and I believe that the stats show that winning in Indy is easier than winning in F1.  [**Mario Andretti**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Andretti), [**Nigel Mansell**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Mansell), [**Emerson Fittipaldi**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_Fittipaldi), [**Jacques Villeneuve**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Villeneuve), and [**Juan Pablo Montoya**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Pablo_Montoya) were very successful in both series.  Andretti, Mansell, Fittipaldi, and Villeneuve all found it easier to be successful on the Indy side.  Montoya had better success in F1, but that was during his prime years; starting in his 30s, he was mainly in NASCAR, where he struggled.  [**Romain Grosjean**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romain_Grosjean) was middling at both but was statistically more successful in Indy.  [**Marcus Ericsson**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Ericsson) has been far more successful on the Indy side, including one Indy 500 win, but he isn’t considered to be among the elite drivers in the series.  Another Indy 500 winner, [**Alexander Rossi**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Rossi), had a cup of coffee in F1 before becoming a very competitive Indy driver.  [**Robert Shwartzman**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Shwartzman) was a reserve driver for Ferrari in 2023 and 2024 before committing to Indy as a rookie this year; I have serious doubts about him; for example, he won pole at the Indy 500 and then [ran over his crew in the pits during the race](https://www.indycar.com/videos/2025/05/05-25-nics-msh-shwartzman-vid). 

At [the Indy 500](https://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/events/indy500/history/historical-stats/driver-stats?page=2) alone, former F1 champions have a good track record (pun intended).  Legendary Scotsman [**Jimmy Clark**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Clark), a two-time champion who dominated F1 in the early 60s, had one win and three top-5 finishes in five attempts at the 500, while fellow two-time F1 Champ [**Graham Hill**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Hill) had three starts with one victory.  Mansel won it once in just two attempts, Villeneuve had one win and two top-5s in only three races, and Fittipaldi had two wins and four top-5s in 11 races.  

Not all F1 champs have enjoyed their time at the Indy 500, however.  Andretti, who had more than three times the number of starts in Indy than in F1, raced at the 500 a total of 29 times (1965-1994), with many of those races coming beyond his prime.  [Andretti was “cursed”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andretti_curse) when it came to the 500, completing all 500 miles just five times, but he did manage one victory and six top-5s.  He also had [one of the most shocking Indy 500 accidents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT3swI7y6DY) during an unplanned qualifying practice in 2003 at the age of 63.  Three-time F1 Champion, and a champion of driver safety as well, [**Sir Jackie Stewart**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Stewart) had just one top-10 in two attempts, and the ageless [**Fernando Alonso**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso), a two-time F1 Champ who has finished on F1 podiums roughly 26 percent of the time, has had no luck in his two attempts to win the Indy 500.  

In sum, the eight former F1 Champions mentioned above earned a total of seven victories and 17 top-5 finishes in 57 races at the Indy 500, with a winning percentage of 12.3 and a top-5 percentage of 29.8.  Those numbers are negatively skewed by Andretti, who is generally considered more of an Indy than an F1 driver.  For comparison, consider a pair of Indy legends, [**Al Unser**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Unser) and [**A.J. Foyt**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Foyt), the two drivers with the most top-5 finishes at the Indy 500, including a record-tying four wins each.  That duo earned a combined eight victories and 23 top-5s in 62 starts for a winning percentage of 12.9 and a top-5 percentage of 37.1.

All in all, the stats say that Indy is easier, but how much is that due to money?  [F1 drivers make roughly ten times as much as IndyCar drivers](https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/motor/2023/03/23/indycar-vs-formula-one-drivers-car-size-salary-popularity-costs/69995865007/).  Could it be that the world’s best drivers are in F1 and that collective superior driving ability from top to bottom supersedes the more difficult driving conditions in Indy?  In other words, it may not matter so much what series you are in; what really matters is how good the other drivers in the series are.  If you combined the top 15-20 F1 drivers with the top 10-15 Indy drivers and had them compete at both levels, say 15 races each for a total of 30, might we see some Indy drivers finishing above some F1 drivers?  I think we definitely would.  Compared to F1, Indy is the wild west, and I don’t know if some F1 drivers could deal with the variety of challenges that Indy drivers face.  It should also be noted that Palou, [**Colton Herta**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colton_Herta), and [**Pato O'Ward**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pato_O%27Ward) have all been courted by F1 teams, though, surprisingly only [Herta appears to be in contention for one of the two open F1 seats with the new Cadillac Team](https://www.newsweek.com/sports/racing/cadillac-f1-team-boss-reveals-big-driver-names-contending-2026-seat-2101425).  

As fun as my fantasy Indy-F1 competition sounds, it’s not going to happen.  As a whole, Formula One clearly looks down on Indy with more than a whiff of royal-like superiority, which clearly annoys the hell out of many Americans.  The GOAT — the MJ of auto racing (and don’t even start) — [**Michael Schumacher**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Schumacher) thought Indy was [too dangerous and the primary landing spot for drivers who could not cut it in F1](https://www.gpfans.com/us/f1-news/1021786/f1-michael-schumacher-interview-reveals-controversial-criticism-f1-rivals-indycar/), while his fierce rival, [**Ayrton Senna**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayrton_Senna), considered Indy for only a minute.  But more than that, F1 is now all about glitz and glamor.  F1 race tracks are mostly pristine, and the cars are significantly more expensive and have roughly 33 percent more horsepower.  F1 races are held at places such as Monaco and Las Vegas, where millionaires and billionaires grace the paddocks, while IndyCar has races in downtown Detroit and Birmingham, Alabama, where you could conceivably catch a stray bullet from a gang war or a drunk squirrel hunter.  Jokes aside, Barber Sports Park features a beautiful track and facilities (but Alabama is among the leading US states for fatal shootings).  On the other hand, t[he FIA respects Indy enough to rank it just slightly below F2 in terms of the ability to earn SuperLicense points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIA_Super_Licence), which says a lot.  

Though improving in terms of popularity, IndyCar still [lags far behind F1 (globally)](https://frontstretch.com/2022/01/10/the-most-popular-motorsports-in-the-world/) and [NASCAR (nationally)](https://thesportsrush.com/nascar-news-steve-phelps-reveals-nascars-biggest-rival-in-the-united-states-and-it-is-not-f1-or-indycar/).  Just ask the bookies, who often don’t even post odds for many IndyCar races.  With its storied history, I highly doubt that IndyCar is in any danger of going away, but at the same time, it makes me mad and sad to see the sport bringing up the rear.  I see the greatness in Indy, and I want the sport to have more respect.  I believe that IndyCar has a compelling combination of grittiness, toughness, strategy, science, and unpredictability that in many ways is more appealing than F1 (and NASCAR, if that needed to be said).  

I actually believe that IndyCar features much of the best of both worlds (F1 and NASCAR), and let’s be honest Formula One fans, some F1 races are as exciting as funeral processions, with roughly the same amount of passing.  Next season, there will be no [Drag Reduction System (DRS) in F1](https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/what-is-drs-in-f1-how-does-it-work-is-it-automatic/10437677/), and I say, “good riddance.”  DRS will be replaced by an ""[active aerodynamics system](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/explained-2026-aerodynamic-regulations-fia-x-mode-z-mode-.26c1CtOzCmN3GfLMywrgb2),"" which will allow the drivers to make in-race, Indy-like adjustments.  Hopefully, the new AAS will equate to more passing, but I am very concerned about the nanny state known as the FIA, which doesn’t plan to allow its drivers to use these in-race adjustments at their discretion, which is absurd and partially why DRS never really worked.  [Indy’s ""push-to-pass"" system](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/motor/indycar-push-to-pass-rule-2024-controversy) has rule limitations, mainly in terms of total usage, but drivers can mostly use push-to-pass any way they see fit, which adds more strategy and intrigue to IndyCar races.

# Where IndyCar Needs to Improve

So, what to do?  In terms of the popularity battle, I believe that **IndyCar should forget trying to compete with NASCAR nationally**.  Think of NASCAR as the NFL while open-wheel is soccer (the type of football that actually emphasizes feet).  In terms of world popularity, the NFL cannot come close to competing with soccer, and it never will, but that’s a story for another day.  

The majority of Americans do not appear to appreciate the complexities of open-wheel racing, but the rest of the world seems to love it, and this bugs the hell out of me.  I apologize ahead of time to NASCAR fans, but in my opinion, it’s somewhat like racing for Neanderthals, whose brains hurt when they have to contemplate science, math, strategy, and tire temps (“What’s downforce?”).  Listen, I get it.  I respect the rebellious history of NASCAR, and I also understand how the sport is relatable to the common man, like me.  But, NASCAR fans, are you not interested in pushing the outermost limits, “*where only Gods dare tread”* (the name of my upcoming book, BTW)?  Are you not interested in fighting a full-out war with drag, gravity, and time (remember, the faster you go, the slower you age)?  Indy and F1 attempt to create the fastest road cars in the world, and many of us would give almost anything to personally experience that extreme speed, but most must settle for viscerally watching those who can.  To me, NASCAR is just mundane in comparison (but I will take any calls offering an opportunity to drive a [Ford Mustang Dark Horse](https://www.motortrend.com/news/2024-ford-mustang-dark-horse-pros-cons-review) at 175 MPH).  However, the most damning verdict of NASCAR comes from the FIA; in terms of SuperLicense points, the FIA has little respect for NASCAR, ranking the competition 17th, the same as Indy NXT and far below IndyCar, F2, and F3.  

More than anything, IndyCar has to begin by drawing more people, especially young people, to its races, and this could be achieved by **expanding the season with at least three additional races and replacing some current races with competitions at new venues**.  The new events should NOT be in the USA; they should be in places such as Mexico City, São Paulo, Buenos Aires, Montreal, Madrid, Circuit Zandvoort in Holland, and Imola, Italy.  Note that close to 60 percent of the 2025 IndyCar drivers are not American, including [nine of the top 12 in the current NTT standings](https://www.indycar.com/Standings).  Why have a “doubleheader” at a poorly attended Iowa Raceway when you could pack the house with Pato fans in Mexico City?  IndyCar has [not raced outside North America for more than a decade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IndyCar_Series_racetracks#:~:text=Since%201996%2C%20INDYCAR%20events%20have,Canada%2C%20Australia%2C%20and%20Brazil.), and those in power will say it’s too expensive, but that’s extremely short sighted.  Open-wheel racing is the future, likely everywhere but America, and there has never been a better time than now to capitalize on that potential.  

With better attendance at Indy events and more attention from the rest of the world, the money would begin flowing in various ways — gate receipts, merchandise, advertising dollars, and so on.  And popularity snowballs if you play your cards right.  However, even with new races, there would be more to be done.  For example, the **IndyCar podium celebrations need to change, immediately**.  As it is now, the end of an Indy race has the look and the energy of a Cub Scout Pinewood Derby competition at the local high school gym.  There are no fans to be seen, and the podiums are about as unimpressive as one could imagine, kinda like my neighbor’s deck on July 4th but worse.  The end of nearly every IndyCar race is anticlimactic and somewhat depressing.  FFS, IndyCar, get the fans involved, pay fake fans if you must, but the end of each race should be a glorious celebration!

Another thing that kills both IndyCar and NASCAR in the eyes of the world is commercials, OMG!  The last time that I attempted to watch the Dayton 500, I had to turn it off because it was commercial after commercial.  TV as we have known it is dying fast, partially due to the damn ads.  Personally, I have not watched a live event for five or more years; I watch everything on delay so I can blow by all of those annoying, pubescent, and brainwashing advertisements.  While watching the replay of IndyCar GP at Toronto, I nearly had a stroke when [Fox Sports was on a commercial break while a multi-car, literal pileup was happening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBTYxus0PKM), SMH.  The one thing you certainly cannot dislike about F1 is that the races are shown commercial free, which is the way it should be.  Open-wheel has so many intricacies and so much strategy, and fans don’t want to miss a second (I like to think that there’s a little bit of [**Bernie Collins**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernadette_Collins) in all of us).  Again, Indy has to change its thinking if it wants to appeal to a wider audience, and **showing the entire race without commercials (or very limited commercials) would be a huge step in the right direction**.  

I will say that Fox Sports has been a significant upgrade over NBC Sports with its coverage of IndyCar.  The ads to promote the sport in the preseason were slick and fun, and the entire weekend production has a better feel.  The announcing teams, both in the commentary box and in the pit, are informative, fun, and intelligent.  Of course, much of the crew came from NBC, such as the effervescent [**Georgia Henneberry**](https://www.foxsports.com/presspass/bios/on-air/georgia-henneberry/), but the additions of [**Jack “Hollywood” Harvey**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Harvey_(racing_driver)) on the grid and [**Will Buxton**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Buxton) in the booth have been outstanding.  Besides the incessant commercials, the main thing that I can complain about is the lack of a compelling pre-race show.  The current pre-race production is too short; Hollywood's grid walk needs to be longer and feature more interesting people to talk with (and more closeups of his hair), and the show should have more in-depth looks at the drivers, the teams, and the history of the sport.  And this is where Fox can put its shite commercials.  

Now let’s talk about women, who make up a huge[ portion of the growing F1 fan base](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/formula-1-and-motorsport-network-unveil-2025-global-fan-survey.4YqMebNy8BLaapyJfjzDXO), and if you click on that previous link, you’ll read that F1 is totally in tune with that development.  I think there are a lot of reasons why women love F1, but one primary thing that many [new female F1 fans talk about is the Netflix show “Drive to Survive.”](https://depauliaonline.com/76324/sports/formulanomenon-female-viewership-is-driving-a-new-wave-of-popularity-for-formula-1/#:~:text=Formulanomenon!%20Female%20viewership%20is%20driving,She's%20not%20the%20only%20one.)  This polished production does a fantastic job at creating and building drama, and it gives viewers the feeling that they know the drivers and those working behind the scenes.  At the same time, **IndyCar currently does a lousy job of allowing fans to “get to know” the drivers and the decision makers and to see all of the drama in between**.  I’m not necessarily suggesting an Indy “Drive to Survive,” though it doesn’t sound like a bad idea.  I think a weekly in-season, behind-the-scenes show might even be better.  

Consider how [Sky Sports covers Formula One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports_F1).  With the glaring exception of the obvious bias towards British drivers, Sky Sports does an exceptional job of reporting on the sport from every angle, including live coverage of all practices and qualifying sessions, a pre-qualifying show, a very entertaining pre-race show, a post-race show, and [Ted’s Notebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kravitz), fun and unscripted paddock broadcasts that fill in the blanks after qualifying and the races.  Sky Sports has a predictable and consistent schedule and doesn’t leave many stones unturned, and it does so with limited commercial breaks.  Fox Sports, meanwhile, does cover practice and qualifying sessions, but it doesn’t do much in between.  Fox also somewhat lacks a consistent pattern for its IndyCar coverage, and without a set routine, it’s more difficult for viewers to become “addicted” to the entire race-week production.  

Common complaints that I often hear from F1 fans who are checking out IndyCar to see if it might interest them is, “Who the hell is who?  Who is on what team?  Why do guys from different teams have cars that look the same?  Why do guys on the same team have cars that look totally different? Why is he in a different car this week?”  I hear ya, F1 brethren.  If you're transitioning from F1 to Indy, it appears to be total chaos, and keeping track of who is who can even be difficult for the race commentators.  On the other hand, it can be difficult to tell teammates apart in F1 because their liveries are exactly the same, and all of the colorful variations in Indy can be fun.  I think there is an easy solution that would eliminate some of the confusion — all **teammates should always share some clear-cut and highly visible commonality on their liveries**, such as a large team logo on the top of the rear wings.  The European teams, McLaren and Prema, already do a pretty good job in making their cars recognizable, so I don’t see why this should be a huge issue for IndyCar as a whole.

How about the sport itself?  Can IndyCar improve the competition?  Yes, it can, and it would entail more copycatting of F1.  First of all, the Honda vs. Chevy competition means fuck all to most of the world — we don’t care!  Our relatives don’t work at either factory, and Japan has been a good ally for more than 75 years.  To a degree, the difference in the engines has been interesting this season, as Chevy generally seems to have more speed but poorer gas mileage, and I think the latter factor has been one of the keys to Honda’s dominance in 2025.  Nevertheless, as I said, I don’t think many outside the teams and engine manufacturers care much about the engine competition.  What’s needed is a serious team competition to add a new layer of drama, similar to the [Constructors Championship in F1](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/the-beginners-guide-to-the-f1-constructors-championship.66nTfWSqrUYv3bnbosPkHV).  Yes, I know that Indy teams are uneven in numbers, some teams cooperate with each other, and there is the “Leaders Circle,” which is publicly discussed less than most national security secrets.  Seriously, go to [IndyCar.com](http://indycar.com) and see how much information you can find on the Leaders Circle.  Come on, Indy, let’s have some **cut-throat team competition**, and promote it while you're at it.  

Speaking of team competition and construction, very unlike F1, [Indy cars are very much the same](https://www.indycar.com/Fan-Info/INDYCAR-101/Introduction-To-INDYCAR/Anatomy-Of-An-INDYCAR#:~:text=Manufacturers:%20American%20Honda%20Motor%20Co,Terms%20of%20Use), with the main exceptions being the Honda or Chevy engines and [the dampers](https://www.the-race.com/indycar/indycars-hidden-development-war-explained/).  Now, the cars can vary significantly in terms of setup, and the in-race adjustments by both the drivers and the teams are very critical.  However, in theory, two teams could be using the same setups, and the drivers for those two teams could be making the same in-race adjustments (extremely unlikely but theoretically possible).  In F1, there are similarities among the cars; for example, there are just four different types of engines used by the current ten teams (don’t ever buy a Renault), and they all use the same tire manufacture, with three different tire (not tyre) options for each race, not counting two types wets.  BUT, there is a reason why they call it the Constructors Championship.  Though [there can be some commonality of parts among the different teams](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/f1-2022s-new-parts-categories-explained/#:~:text=Formula%201%20has%20four%20formal%20parts%20designations,the%20FIA.%20SSCs%20include:%20*%20Wheel%20covers), the potential differences between F1 cars are virtually infinite.  That’s why all the James Bond stuff goes on in F1 — they spy on each other, steal from each other, and tattle on each other, like bratty 5-year-olds.  It’s kinda humorous, but it’s also deadly serious business that can amount to millions of Euros.  The cost of [development and construction of the new 2026 F1 models is estimated to be somewhere between $15-21 million](https://carsjovo.com/mercedes-amg-f1-car-cost-team-running-expenses-2025/) each, which is [more than the entire budgets of some Indy teams](https://racer.com/2025/02/25/why-do-indycar-team-budgets-keep-climbing).

And that’s the crux between F1 and IndyCar — money!  F1 has investors that can probably afford to buy entire countries, at least Greenland.  That’s not to say that billionaire IndyCar owner [**Roger Penske**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penske) is poor (definitely cranky, though), but the total amount of money invested in and made by F1 is in another league — think of the NFL vs. UFL (or USFL or XXXL or whatever it’s called these days).  Without a huge influx of money, we will never see Indy cars differentiating much, which is a shame because that, too, adds another layer of strategy, drama, and intrigue.  Some might say the differentiating between the rich and the poor teams ruins F1, but have they ever watched “[Brawn: The Impossible Formula 1 Story](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22297946/),” which should have been the basis for the F1 Movie?  And doesn’t the rich-poor effect already exist in IndyCar, too?  We all know the potential for Indy to be more profitable is there, and if the income does significantly increase over time, there should be **a gradual shift to differentiate the construction between teams**, hopefully.  And as I said before, even under the current IndyCar structure, there could be a more interesting team competition, with a little effort and creativity.  

If money is the issue, what about **IndyCar merging with F2?**  The Indy 500 was included in the F1 Championship from 1950 to 1960, and according to the FIA, the two competitions are perfectly on par, which probably isn’t true because I suspect a good number of the F2 kids would flounder under IndyCar conditions and competition.  Former F2 drivers currently in Indy include Shwartzman, [**Christian Lundgaard**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Lundgaard), [**Marcus Armstrong**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Armstrong), and [**Callum Ilott**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callum_Ilott), so, from a competitive standpoint, some of the F2 youngsters should be able to battle with the grizzled Indy vets, but for most, I doubt it would be ideal conditions for growth and development.  It would be a trial by fire for sure, however.  

From an F1 perspective, there may not be a good reason to merge F2 and Indy— things are going swimmingly as is.  From an Indy fan perspective, it sounds fantastic, at least to me — let’s get an injection of money into the sport and see if our drivers are as good as we think.  Indy ownership, however, seems to be old-school, stubborn, and resistant to change, which might be a fatal flaw in a business sense.  Logistically, which series melds into the other?  Indy and F1 may look similar at first glance, but they’re really not the same animal.  F1 would likely resist adopting many of the things we love about Indy — the grittiness, the contact, the limited officiating, and the crazy tracks.  F1 would likely want F2-Indy to be a feeder system for F1, and that would likely mean all F1 rules and conditions would have to apply.  In sum, I’d love to see the two series merge and meet in the middle, but I’d bet that F1 would be an inflexible negotiating partner in this scenario.  

I think a better option would be a different type alignment with F1, one where **IndyCar becomes the next step after F2** and is also a place where very popular drivers, such as [**Daniel Ricciardo**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo), can race, remain highly visible, and be paid a relatively competitive salary — there’s no way Danny Ric would race in IndyCar under the current salary structure.  This F1-Indy venture would require a true meeting in the middle to preserve some of IndyCar’s uniqueness and positive qualities, but also would require Indy to be more like F1 so that drivers can transition in between series with minimal adjustment.  If another [**Kimi Antonelli**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Kimi_Antonelli) is flourishing in F2, he can make the direct jump to F1.  In the case of a Lundgaard or an Armstrong, they can move to Indy, earn a better salary, and gain valuable experience against veterans, but still have a path to F1.  Again, the attraction for Indy would be a huge influx of cash and more world exposure, while the attraction for F1 would be another potential money making machine and a feeder system that would feature late bloomers and highly experienced backups.  Perhaps I am being naive with these merger ideas but doesn’t it sound fun?

As things are, I see IndyCar as a combination of F1 and NASCAR, and I like that for the most part.  I wish IndyCar weekends didn’t have a second-rate feel.  I also wish Indy drivers had more of a chance to test their mettle vs. their F1 counterparts, and I wish the sport had more respect in general.  In order for the series to flourish, I believe that Indy leadership needs to wake up.  The world is changing fast, as fast as an [RB19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing_RB19), and old-school thinking won’t work.  IndyCar shouldn’t compete with NASCAR in America; instead, it needs to **expand globally and adopt many of the strategies that have worked so well for F1**.  Indy will always take a backseat to F1 globally and may always have to do the same with NASCAR nationally, but being No. 2 in the world wouldn’t be so bad — at a minimum, Indy could afford better podiums.  🙂",1,1753877674.0,OpenWheelMadness,0,1.0,False

1md4y2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/CureFibroidsNaturally/comments/1md4y2h/is_there_a_natural_cure_for_fibroids/,IS THERE A NATURAL CURE FOR FIBROIDS?,"# 🌿 Yes — There Is a Natural Way to Shrink Fibroids: Here's How

If you’ve ever asked, **“Is there a natural cure for fibroids?”** — the answer is **yes**, for many women.

While “cure” means different things to different people, many have successfully **shrunk or eliminated fibroids**, avoided surgery, and reclaimed their health using **natural methods**. The key? **Consistency**, a **whole-body approach**, and understanding your unique hormone balance.

Let’s explore the natural strategies that can *actually* work.

# 🧬 First: Why Do Fibroids Grow?

Fibroids are **non-cancerous tumors** that grow in the uterus, fueled by:

* **Estrogen dominance**
* **Chronic inflammation**
* **Poor liver detox**
* **Stress and cortisol imbalance**

To naturally reverse fibroids, you need to target the **root causes** — not just the symptoms.

# ✅ Natural Fibroid-Fighting Plan

# 1. 🥦 Estrogen Detox with Food

Excess estrogen = fibroid fuel. Detox it naturally with:

* **Cruciferous veggies**: broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts (rich in DIM)
* **Flax seeds**: balance estrogen and provide fiber
* **Whole grains & legumes**: help eliminate excess hormones
* **Leafy greens**: reduce inflammation and support liver function

**Avoid**: dairy, red meat, processed food, soy, alcohol, and caffeine — all known to disrupt hormones or trigger inflammation.

# 2. 🌿 Herbs & Supplements That Shrink Fibroids

* **Green Tea Extract (EGCG)** – Clinically shown to reduce fibroid size and symptoms
* **Vitex (Chaste Tree Berry)** – Helps regulate progesterone and balance hormones
* **DIM (Diindolylmethane)** – From cruciferous veggies, it helps your body break down estrogen safely
* **Milk Thistle** – Supports liver detox (key for estrogen clearance)
* **Turmeric + Ginger** – Anti-inflammatory powerhouses
* **Iodine (in small, monitored doses)** – Can help shrink fibroids when used with a functional practitioner

>

# 3. 💆‍♀️ Castor Oil Packs (Old-School but Effective)

Apply warm castor oil packs to the lower abdomen 3–5x per week. These:

* Improve circulation and lymphatic drainage
* Support detox pathways
* Help reduce fibroid size over time

Add **abdominal massage** for extra support.

# 4. 🧘‍♀️ Manage Stress = Balance Hormones

Chronic stress raises cortisol, which throws off **progesterone and estrogen**. To reset:

* Practice breathwork, yoga, or meditation daily
* Prioritize sleep — aim for 7–9 hours
* Set boundaries and create emotional space to heal

# 5. 🧃 Liver & Gut Health = Hormone Health

* Drink **dandelion root tea**, **burdock**, or **lemon water** for liver support
* Add **probiotics** and fermented foods (sauerkraut, kefir, kimchi)
* Consider **coffee enemas** or liver detox protocols under guidance

Your liver and gut work together to remove old hormones. Keep them happy = fewer fibroids.

# 🗓️ How Long Does It Take?

* With consistent changes, **some women see results in 3–6 months**
* Fibroids may shrink, soften, or stop growing
* Symptoms like bloating, bleeding, and pain often improve first

# ✨ Real Women, Real Results

Thousands of women have:

* Avoided surgery
* Shrunk fibroids naturally
* Regained their energy, cycle regularity, and fertility

You're not stuck. Your body wants to heal — it just needs the right tools.

# 💬 Final Thoughts

**Yes, natural healing is possible.**  
No, it’s not overnight.  
But with the right plan and consistency, **your body can shrink fibroids and restore balance**.

You’re not broken — your body is just asking for a reset.",1,1753877595.0,CureFibroidsNaturally,0,1.0,False

The S&P 500 broke its six-day run of record-high closes on Tuesday, with several recent meme favorites driving the pullback. Opendoor fell 12%, GoPro and Krispy Kreme each dropped over 8%. Futures are flat heading into what’s expected to be a pivotal day for markets.

**2. All Eyes on the Fed**

The Federal Reserve announces its interest rate decision at 2 p.m. ET, with Fed funds futures showing a 98% chance of no change. However, Chair Jerome Powell’s 2:30 p.m. press conference could move markets, especially with the White House continuing to pressure the Fed for cuts. Last week’s awkward back-and-forth between Trump and Powell over renovation costs adds extra intrigue.

**3. China Trade Deal Unlikely by Deadline**

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick signaled that no U.S.-China trade deal is expected before Friday’s tariff deadline. Though other countries struck agreements, China appears to be negotiating separately. Businesses face potential tariff hikes, but Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplayed the risks, suggesting the increases may not be permanent.

**4. Starbucks Surprises to the Upside**

Starbucks shares are rising premarket after the coffee chain beat revenue expectations in Q3. CEO Brian Niccol said their turnaround is accelerating, fueled by a return to basics and operational simplification. Still, same-store sales declined for the sixth straight quarter, so the work isn’t done.

**5. Gucci Sales Slump**

Gucci’s parent company, Kering, reported a 25% drop in Q2 Gucci sales, leading to a 15% company-wide decline. Sales were especially weak in Japan and Asia-Pacific, dragging the luxury conglomerate’s results below Wall Street expectations. A tough look for one of fashion’s most iconic names.

\-------  
  
  
The year I finished high school, on Mom's birthday, Dad brought home a mother-daughter pair and a red rose.  
  
  
Mom took the red rose the little girl handed her and quietly spent her 39th birthday. That night, she slit her wrists.  
  
  
So on my wedding day, I told my husband Blake Ashford, ""If you want a divorce, just give me red roses.""  
  
  
He held me close and said, ""Don't worry, babe. There won't be any flowers in our house. Ever.""  
  
  
Five years later, during a company bidding process, he kicked out the partners and blacklisted them completely—just because someone on their team wore a red rose on her chest.  
  
  
That day, I realized marriage could actually be beautiful.  
  
  
Until six months later, I finished my new drug research and walked out of the lab.  
  
  
The entire hallway was covered in roses.  
  
  
And there was Blake, standing in the middle of it.  
  
  
Right next to him? The same woman he'd kicked out of his company, smiling like the cat who got the cream.  
  
  
My face turned ice-cold, but the man just shrugged like it was no big deal.  
  
  
""Lila put all this together for you. She's your sister. She came here to patch things up between you two.""  
  
  
I stared at Blake for two seconds flat, then turned and walked out.  
  
  
I don't have a sister.  
  
  
And as of right now, I don't need a husband either.  
  
  
...  
  
  
I sat alone at Mom's grave for three hours. Today was her birthday and the tenth anniversary of her death.  
  
  
Red roses used to mean love for my parents.  
  
  
But ten years ago today, Dad just stood there while his mistress's daughter Lila Morrison handed Mom that rose, breaking her completely.  
  
  
Red roses became my worst nightmare.  
  
  
And ten years later, my husband brought the woman who destroyed my mother right back to me, with all those damn flowers. Talk about a knife to the heart.  
  
  
Fireworks lit up the sky in the distance—Blake's party celebrating my drug research. Six months of hell, 180 days of no sleep, all my work. Now it felt like Lila's victory dance.  
  
  
I said goodbye to Mom and stood up when Blake called.  
  
  
He was drunk: ""Party's almost over and you're MIA? What kind of research director are you?""  
  
  
I stayed quiet.  
  
  
Any other night, I would've been all playful and sweet with him. But tonight I had nothing to say.  
  
  
Blake's voice got louder: ""Ember, I'm talking to you! Where the hell did you disappear to?""  
  
  
""The cemetery.""  
  
  
Blake went silent. Like he suddenly remembered today was my mom's anniversary. Like he suddenly remembered that for my research, I'd skipped my own birthday, canceled our anniversary dinner. The one thing I asked for was for him to come with me to visit Mom.  
  
  
Two seconds of dead silence before Blake finally spoke: ""I... I was so excited about today, I forgot.""  
  
  
""Wait for me.""  
  
  
I hung up, then turned and left straight away.  
  
  
But when I reached the parking lot, Blake's texts came through:  
  
  
\[Ember, it's too late tonight. Next time, okay?\]  
  
  
\[Lila's wasted. I need to get her home first.\]  
  
  
\[Don't worry, I'll make it up to you.\]  
  
  
I wasn't surprised at all.  
  
  
With Lila's games, of course she'd find a way to keep Blake busy tonight. I could see right through her act. Blake, who'd survived years in cutthroat business, could definitely see it too.  
  
  
But Blake didn't care. He was enjoying every second of it. He didn't give a damn about my feelings.  
  
  
That's fine though. From now on, I don't have to care about his either.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
Blake didn't come home that night. No texts, no calls, nothing.  
  
  
I didn't care. Didn't even ask.  
  
  
Next morning, I got to the office early. Blake was the CEO, I ran R&D. In five years, we'd built this company from a garage startup to a downtown powerhouse.  
  
  
But our relationship? Went the opposite direction.  
  
  
Phase one of the new drug was done, so things were pretty quiet for now.  
  
  
I was sipping my coffee, reading through the divorce papers my lawyer sent, when Blake walked into my office.  
  
  
I was drinking my coffee and going through the divorce papers my lawyer sent when Blake strolled into my office.  
  
  
""Lila twisted her ankle getting out of the car last night, so I had to take care of her.  
  
  
It got really late, so I just grabbed a hotel room.""  
  
  
I nodded and kept reading my divorce papers, answering without looking up: ""Okay, got it.""  
  
  
Made sense. We were about to get divorced anyway.  
  
  
Who he slept with and where was his business, not mine. No need to keep me in the loop.  
  
  
Blake froze, like he wanted to say something but held back:  
  
  
""Let's grab dinner tonight. You're the star of this whole drug project—we should celebrate properly.""  
  
  
He paused, glanced at me, then added: ""Maybe we should invite Lila too. I think you two need to talk. She was just a kid when your mom died, you know.""  
  
  
Hearing Blake defend Lila made my hand stop mid-page.  
  
  
I wanted to ask him—wasn't I just a kid too when my mom killed herself?  
  
  
I pushed down my anger, took a sip of coffee, and said quietly: ""Mind your own business. Tonight, just us two.""  
  
  
We needed to talk about the divorce anyway. Didn't need an audience.  
  
  
Sister? My mom only had one daughter. Me.  
  
  
Blake looked at me like I was being jealous.  
  
  
He was about to smirk and say something when his phone rang.  
  
  
The second he saw ""Lila"" pop up, his face lit up. He grabbed his phone and bolted out of my office.  
  
  
Near closing time, Blake sent me a restaurant reservation.  
  
  
Some fancy private place. His idea of making it up to me.  
  
  
I stuffed the divorce papers in my bag and headed out.  
  
  
Blake's car pulled up as I left the building. He rolled down the window: ""Go home and get ready. Quick client meeting, then I'll meet you there.""",1,1753877134.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

A 12-year-old girl walked into the pediatric ER, coughing and gleefully spraying infectious droplets in her delightfully sickly way. She seemed calm-at least as far as one can tell from behind the door separating the waiting area from the treatment rooms.

She was received by the sad Intern, the one who was sure he’d be home by 10, and only the “real” doctors would stay the night. He was so depressed he forgot to take a medical history. But he *did* manage to gather enough data to realize she had a febrile illness (nothing dramatic, maybe 38.2°C over the past couple of days), she was coughing, and her chest hurt when she coughed. Not bad for a 30-second history.

He even sent her for a chest X-ray.

The scan is right here:

 

 

https://preview.redd.it/87ntfwiq40gf1.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaa879a020b475bb29be57cdf2c762d9eb7a0830

The interpretation? For the benefit of our dear surgical colleagues and others who see chest X-rays as deranged Rorschach tests: it’s normal on the right (where you see the “R” sticker-that’s *your* left, but the patient’s right). So normal on the right = obviously abnormal on the left. Something big is there. “Pneumonia,” thought the sad Intern. Way-too-interesting case of pneumonia in the middle of summer.

He presented the case to his senior - the second-year resident who was mainly busy looking for his payslip. The scan impressed him. Left-sided pneumonia. And in June. Almost interesting.

“Let’s admit her,” suggested the gloomy one.  
“Why not? Good idea,” replied Payslip Guy.

All they needed now was a good excuse and some treatment orders.

“Write down pleuritic chest pain” (a fancy term for pain while breathing or coughing), “and start Rocephin and Azithro. Yes, throw in some Azithro,” said the senior, feeling oddly artistic. There was a hint of unnecessary genius in that decision (*actually*, *utterly superfluous, Prof. BS*).

The cheerful patient, still coughing non-stop and spreading disease with carefree abandon, was admitted to the ward with her mother, a Bedouin woman in her fifties who had no idea why hospitalization was necessary but figured it’s good someone was checking on her daughter.

They were received by a first-year resident. A good person. Knew medicine like your car mechanic knows quantum physics, only with less body hair and lower pay.

The chest X-ray and ER notes made a solid, professional impression: left-sided pneumonia, with treatment recommendations. Easy. She could just copy the orders into the admission note and go to bed without waking the always-grumpy on-call attending (me, of course). In her excitement, she forgot to take a history or look into the patient's dark and mysterious past.

I arrived in the morning, suffering from acute caffeine deficiency and a total lack of enthusiasm for my daily round-theater performance. My jokes about *Streptococcus pneumoniae* tend to bore hollow, ungrateful minds after the tenth repetition. Philistines.

As I drained the last miserable coffee grounds from the tin and waited for water to boil, the intern bounced in all smiles (she’d slept two hours - good for her) and asked what to present during rounds. I told her to brief the incoming team, and I’d discuss everything during early rounds. That way, we’d waste less time than usual.

**Fast forward two hours to morning rounds.**

The resident with the ridiculous French goatee was still talking. Something about enteral feeds and vital signs of patients discharged two days ago. So smooth and confident, I almost didn’t want to interrupt him to let him embarrass himself.

We finally got to Room 2.

Our patient was in bed, busy counting the staggering number of people in the room. Three residents, including Cyrano de Bergerac (French goatee), two delightfully unaware interns (the good kind), two nurses, three terrified nursing students, and four fourth-year med students.  
And yes, me too.

It was a **multi-provider event** (as opposed to a mass casualty incident).

The Kevin Durant of the residents (French goatee) summarized everything: the patient’s age (12), symptoms (cough and pleuritic chest pain), and the X-ray findings (left-sided pneumonia). He even mentioned some lab results (leukocytosis or whatever), and proudly concluded: “She’s being treated with Rocephin and Azithro.”

That was my cue to scold him for this weak presentation, but before I could even clear my throat-

**A student jumped out from the back.**  
Who knew they were sentient?

“Dr. B.S.,” he stammered (careful, punk - it’s *Professor* BS to you), “I found old scans of the patient from last year in the hospital system.”

Normally, I would’ve hit the vaporization button that instantly incinerates meddling med students (yes, such a button exists), but curiosity got the better of me.

“Interesting. What’s in the old scan?” I asked dryly, trying to hide my swelling pride.

**Here’s what was in the scan:**

 

https://preview.redd.it/p3zbx5ks40gf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7ed24cfee61f1e58039f749e215724c8b5c4a7d

A big smile nearly spread across my face.

“What do you think this shows?” I asked the student, who had grown a few inches taller, while French Goatee shrank to the size of a garden gnome.

“Maybe a round pneumonia on the left?” the student guessed, ruining the moment.

“You think a pneumonia has been sitting there for a whole year?” I pushed.

He was silent. Poor guy. Still young. Still learning.

“This, my friend,” I said with theatrical faux-compassion, “is a clear hydatid cyst.”

Blank stares. Nobody had a clue.

The patient was entertained by the absurd medical theater. Her mother was over the moon. So much attention. Her daughter was a star.

“It’s a cyst, a larval stage of *Echinococcus granulosus*,” I explained. “Acquired by ingesting dog feces containing the parasite’s eggs.”

“Do you have a dog, dear mother?” I asked. She didn’t look happy anymore.

“No! Of course not!” she protested.

“Not even stray dogs in the yard?” I pressed, knowing the answer.

“Oh, lots of those. But the girl doesn’t touch them,” she tried, one last time.

“Not even a year or two ago?” I dealt the final blow.

The girl stepped in to protect her mom and confessed: she pets and feeds the dogs all the time.

Now I could finally begin my **monumental lecture** on echinococcosis.

I managed to order a CT scan, which confirmed exactly what you see in the image, before clearing my throat again (that coffee is *terrible*, I tell you) and launching into my lecture.

I saw a man who introduced himself as a startup founder and was chatting to a woman who was from Bombay but would be staying in ahmedabad briefly. 

We 3 were sitting on the same table so I was privy to their conversation. :P Naa chahte hue bhi. 

So, middle of the conversation, this guy started hitting on the woman. She explicitly told him she was married. 

But, that didn't stop him from hitting and taking a chance on her. 

Also, at one point he started gaslighting her and tried to convience her that shaadi bohot buri cheez hai.. everyone should just enjoy their lives without commitment etc etc. 

voh gadhi bhi patiently baat sun ri thi uski and if I may take the liberty to say was leading him on as they exchanged digits. 

mujhe dono ki baatein sun k itna cringy feel ho rha tha but there was no empty table to occupy so I had to bear them for 2 whole hours. 

Now, I want to know from the older men i.e. 30+ what kick do men get hitting on married women? There are plenty of fishes in the sea.. tumhe kisi aur ki goldfish me kyu interest hai? Just want to genuinely understand from Older Men's POV.

golden light over his back like honey, warm and slow. he was sleeping on his side, lashes tangled, lips slightly parted. one arm stretched into the space where i'd been, searching, soft. the sheets were kicked off, twisted around his waist, and i stood there, still and barefoot, memorising him like scripture. he was beautiful. not in the loud way that turns heads, but in the quiet way that ruins you. a person who had a pulse i knew better than my own, the kind you build altars to without realising you’re praying. dangerous. the light kissed his shoulder. i was standing there, desperately trying to remember everything. i knew all we had was to end soon. not because i didn’t love him. i loved him. i loved him more than i wanted to love him. i had given almost every piece of myself. love made me. he made me. he took me down in the process. his grip too strong, his touch too rough. and i crushed. i’d fallen apart in his hands. he gave me pieces of him too, shining and burning like the sun, things i tried to string into something whole. we were trying. i was trying. but some loves are wild storms in glass rooms. beautiful, breathless, and doomed to break everything they touch. they suffocate you. it became undoing. i was aware. (...)



i pressed my lips to his forehead, and i left him sleeping in the softest light. tears down my cheeks. it was still early in the morning. he woke up to the smell of fresh coffee. we had breakfast on the balcony.

A 12-year-old girl walked into the pediatric ER, coughing and gleefully spraying infectious droplets in her delightfully sickly way. She seemed calm-at least as far as one can tell from behind the door separating the waiting area from the treatment rooms.

She was received by the sad Intern, the one who was sure he’d be home by 10, and only the “real” doctors would stay the night. He was so depressed he forgot to take a medical history. But he *did* manage to gather enough data to realize she had a febrile illness (nothing dramatic, maybe 38.2°C over the past couple of days), she was coughing, and her chest hurt when she coughed. Not bad for a 30-second history.

He even sent her for a chest X-ray.

The scan is right here:

 

https://preview.redd.it/dyahf5ia40gf1.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=a31406121dceb328eabf36d9d5b1f48895032c87



 

The interpretation? For the benefit of our dear surgical colleagues and others who see chest X-rays as deranged Rorschach tests: it’s normal on the right (where you see the “R” sticker-that’s *your* left, but the patient’s right). So normal on the right = obviously abnormal on the left. Something big is there. “Pneumonia,” thought the sad Intern. Way-too-interesting case of pneumonia in the middle of summer.

He presented the case to his senior - the second-year resident who was mainly busy looking for his payslip. The scan impressed him. Left-sided pneumonia. And in June. Almost interesting.

“Let’s admit her,” suggested the gloomy one.  
“Why not? Good idea,” replied Payslip Guy.

All they needed now was a good excuse and some treatment orders.

“Write down pleuritic chest pain” (a fancy term for pain while breathing or coughing), “and start Rocephin and Azithro. Yes, throw in some Azithro,” said the senior, feeling oddly artistic. There was a hint of unnecessary genius in that decision (*actually*, *utterly superfluous, Prof. BS*).

The cheerful patient, still coughing non-stop and spreading disease with carefree abandon, was admitted to the ward with her mother, a Bedouin woman in her fifties who had no idea why hospitalization was necessary but figured it’s good someone was checking on her daughter.

They were received by a first-year resident. A good person. Knew medicine like your car mechanic knows quantum physics, only with less body hair and lower pay.

The chest X-ray and ER notes made a solid, professional impression: left-sided pneumonia, with treatment recommendations. Easy. She could just copy the orders into the admission note and go to bed without waking the always-grumpy on-call attending (me, of course). In her excitement, she forgot to take a history or look into the patient's dark and mysterious past.

I arrived in the morning, suffering from acute caffeine deficiency and a total lack of enthusiasm for my daily round-theater performance. My jokes about *Streptococcus pneumoniae* tend to bore hollow, ungrateful minds after the tenth repetition. Philistines.

As I drained the last miserable coffee grounds from the tin and waited for water to boil, the intern bounced in all smiles (she’d slept two hours - good for her) and asked what to present during rounds. I told her to brief the incoming team, and I’d discuss everything during early rounds. That way, we’d waste less time than usual.

**Fast forward two hours to morning rounds.**

The resident with the ridiculous French goatee was still talking. Something about enteral feeds and vital signs of patients discharged two days ago. So smooth and confident, I almost didn’t want to interrupt him to let him embarrass himself.

We finally got to Room 2.

Our patient was in bed, busy counting the staggering number of people in the room. Three residents, including Cyrano de Bergerac (French goatee), two delightfully unaware interns (the good kind), two nurses, three terrified nursing students, and four fourth-year med students.  
And yes, me too.

It was a **multi-provider event** (as opposed to a mass casualty incident).

The Kevin Durant of the residents (French goatee) summarized everything: the patient’s age (12), symptoms (cough and pleuritic chest pain), and the X-ray findings (left-sided pneumonia). He even mentioned some lab results (leukocytosis or whatever), and proudly concluded: “She’s being treated with Rocephin and Azithro.”

That was my cue to scold him for this weak presentation, but before I could even clear my throat-

**A student jumped out from the back.**  
Who knew they were sentient?

“Dr. B.S.,” he stammered (careful, punk - it’s *Professor* BS to you), “I found old scans of the patient from last year in the hospital system.”

Normally, I would’ve hit the vaporization button that instantly incinerates meddling med students (yes, such a button exists), but curiosity got the better of me.

“Interesting. What’s in the old scan?” I asked dryly, trying to hide my swelling pride.

**Here’s what was in the scan:**  


 

https://preview.redd.it/4d80n14c40gf1.png?width=887&format=png&auto=webp&s=622d4fcfdc7080a4ff9e770049d1c38b7a196a20

A big smile nearly spread across my face.

“What do you think this shows?” I asked the student, who had grown a few inches taller, while French Goatee shrank to the size of a garden gnome.

“Maybe a round pneumonia on the left?” the student guessed, ruining the moment.

“You think a pneumonia has been sitting there for a whole year?” I pushed.

He was silent. Poor guy. Still young. Still learning.

“This, my friend,” I said with theatrical faux-compassion, “is a clear hydatid cyst.”

Blank stares. Nobody had a clue.

The patient was entertained by the absurd medical theater. Her mother was over the moon. So much attention. Her daughter was a star.

“It’s a cyst, a larval stage of *Echinococcus granulosus*,” I explained. “Acquired by ingesting dog feces containing the parasite’s eggs.”

“Do you have a dog, dear mother?” I asked. She didn’t look happy anymore.

“No! Of course not!” she protested.

“Not even stray dogs in the yard?” I pressed, knowing the answer.

“Oh, lots of those. But the girl doesn’t touch them,” she tried, one last time.

“Not even a year or two ago?” I dealt the final blow.

The girl stepped in to protect her mom and confessed: she pets and feeds the dogs all the time.

My name is Undy Ferenmopf. I’m a journalist for the Laxinian news outlet The Kanawaukee Post. The following tale happened during the Invasion of Nescria, more commonly known as The Nescrian Genocide. This wasn’t written or edited by anyone. The story you’re about to read is raw, pure, unapologetic and definitely not for the faint of heart.  

 

I believe you’ve heard stories about various genocides that took place in history. The Armenian Genocide, Rwanda, Srebrenica, The Holocaust... But what if I told you this was worse than all of them? At an estimated ten million lives lost due to cluster munitions, artillery grenades, kamikaze drones, disease, starvation and what else not, the Nescrian Genocide is a reminder of what happens when the world doesn’t learn from the past, when everyone is too busy worrying about the petty little things such as oil exports and alliances, instead of worrying about the most priceless thing in the world; the human life. We swore to never let Holocaust happen again, didn’t we? We have failed spectacularly.  

 

These pages, these words, these spelling mistakes you’re about to see... They were written by a sixteen-year-old girl who knew more about life and torture than any world leader ever will. She lived through worse than hell, yet she was never hailed a hero. It’s my job to change that.  

 

It all began on the 9^(th) of May 2025, in the capital city of Nescria. It was a Friday after school. Marianne and her best friend Eyri were sitting in front of their school. It was one of the biggest schools in Ghirandza, the capital of Nescria, a central Ascrian country known for its gorgeous mountains and friendly population. It was a country where the sun shined on the golden sunflower fields and snowy mountaintops.  

 

I can only imagine Eyri and Marianne chatting about your typical teenage things such as their hatred for school, crushes, fashion choices and so on... Neither of them thought that this would be the last normal day they’d have in their lives. The last time they’d ever see one another. They waited for their parents to come pick them up in front of their school, which was large, with orange walls on the outside, a small park in front of it and a lot of windows. It was just a normal school you’d see anywhere. Both girls lived lives just like you and me. Until they didn’t... 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10^(th) May 2025-Day 1 

Ghirandza, Nescria 

 

What a wake-up call! At 5:43 in the morning, hearing sirens? You can’t imagine, can you? Neither could I. At first, I thought it was another drill. I mean, I knew about the Axis troops near our border. I closed my brown eyes again, but didn’t drift off to sleep yet. Maybe a couple seconds passed, and I heard a loud ‘bang!’ coming from the street. I looked out of the window in my small room located on the second floor of our two-story white house.  

 

I saw a bright orange glow, almost like I was staring at the sun. Then came another, and another... It was clear, this was no sunrise, it was the beginning of an invasion. 

 

One or two moments later, a loud and powerful shockwave sent glass within a several mile radius shattering. I myself was cut by a shard. I screamed in fear and pain while mom and dad rushed to get me to the basement. We ran down our wide staircase while the rumbling and orange glows continued mere blocks away. I can’t... You can’t imagine the terror... 

 

We entered our basement. It was somewhat big, with no flooring panels, just the cold, bare concrete. I had no shoes on. I was only in my rose short-sleeved crop-top and shorts I used for sleeping. Dad hugged me and mom, holding us tighter than he ever did. My heart was pounding in my chest like never before. I knew it then. I knew... It had begun. The Axis have attacked.  

 

My mother fell asleep as the explosions and shockwaves started to die down. I, on the other hand, kept my eyes open through the night. I spent the night talking to my dad. By talking, I mean him trying to comfort me. We knew we had to escape the country.  

 

We had no idea what was left of our house, if anything. Our basement had a few small windows overlooking the street. I looked outside and saw a scene right out of a movie. Fire engulfed the old bakery where we used to buy bread and croissants. I remember just stopping there on my way home from school just to enjoy the smell or to buy a quick snack and yoghurt while I’d wait for dinner. Now, it was gone. There was nothing there, just a pile of concrete in a crater. People were screaming while engulfed in flames, bleeding, losing limbs. Even dead bodies covered the street. My dad pulled me away from the window, saying that I shouldn’t be looking at the horrors outside, but he knew that this was our only view for who knows how long.  

 

After the bombings died down around eight in the morning, my dad went out of the basement to get a few things he said we’d use for survival. I begged him not to go, but he went anyway. I had no idea what our house was like, nor if he would return. I held my breath and shook in my skin for the longest and most grueling ten minutes of my life. I heard deep footsteps outside. Running. They burst through the door of our house and started shouting. “Anybody here?” I heard a deep male voice ask. One part of me wanted to respond, but my mom put her hand on my mouth, saying it culd be the Nexians, one of the Axis members. They left after a minute, but still, there was no sign of my dad.  

 

The bombs started falling again. This time, closer and closer. One even hit our house, or the neighbor’s house. I’m not sure, but the sound was something I’ll never forget. Still, the silence was worse. You knew they were aiming, preparing to launch more, and there was nothing you could do. Not even prepare.  

 

Ten horrifying minutes passed, and mom and I heard the basement door open. Since our staircase is spiral, we couldn’t yet see who it was. I whispered my father’s name, but got no response back. I then saw a tall man in his pajamas. Relieved, I ran to hug him. Never have I been happier to see my dad alive. He brought two backpacks with him. In one, there was canned food, water and batteries enough to sustain us for a week or two. In the other, there were clothes, a radio and flashlights. I immediately changed to a blue sweater and thighs he brought. It was much better protection from the cold, bare concrete on the floor and walls of the basement.  

 

Dad quickly turned on the radio and switched to the national radio station, hoping to hear news about evacuation or even what was going on. Hearing the voice of the guy on the radio was such a relieving moment. I knew that we were still fighting, still alive, still somewhat functioning.  

 

\-At approximately five in the morning local time, the Axis forces have begun their invasion of the Republic of Nescria. We are in the process of being encircled from the sides of Axfia, Charania, South Norifia, Nexia and Kiryunia. Our only hopes are Paracavia, which is also in the process of being invaded by the forces of Nexia and South Norifia, or the free Bambarska, which has declared neutrality. The government has yet to initiate evacuation from Ghirandza. So far, it is estimated that around two thousand people were killed in the airstrikes this morning around Nescria, with 

 many more missing. We are still awaiting the world’s response. May God help us all. Good luck!-   

 

The radio cut to static. No music, no radio shows... Nothing but despair and fear. Mom and dad held me tighter as the bombs continued to fall around the city. I looked out of another basement window and saw a boy, maybe fifteen. A little older than me. Though, age doesn’t matter this time around. We’re all in this with one goal: survival. I waved at him, he waved back with a terrified smile. I hope to one day be able to visit him with no fear that a cluster would fall on my head. I just hope to see peace soon... 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11^(th) May 2025-Day 2   
Ghirandza, Nescria 

 

They’re not stopping. The bombs are falling every minute. They don’t care if it’s day or night, they just drop them. The roar of the Axfian jets... It’s haunting. One moment, you hear a whoosh, the other, you explode. Last night, four more houses on our street have been leveled. It’s all gone. Our house is left without a roof, but that’s a blessing compared to the neighboring ones, which have been reduced to rubble. The radio is losing signal. I think they're trying to cut the signal.  

 

I took a piece of paper from the drawer and wrote a few messages for the boy across the street. One of them was just a simple ‘hope to see you alive tomorrow’. Our lives have been drawn down to praying that we’d survive, but I don’t know what we’re surviving for. There is no Nescria left to rebuild, we’re being encircled by the Axis, escape is too risky... The air smells of burnt plastic, rubber and death. People are dying on the streets, burning in their basements... I think they’re using napalm. The little that was heard from the radio broadcast was just more praying and more terror... 

 

\-I hope you’re still listening. The Axis powers are committing atrocities across our nation. Thousands of innocent civilians have been executed either by the bombings or executions by the Axis. The world is slow to respond, and we’re running out of time. May the higher power spare us. Good luck, brave people of Nescria!- 

 

The radio transmition cut to static again. It got colder down here. Maybe I’m just more terrified? I’m not sure anymore. I just know that these days, this terror, will be the last thing I ever experience. I barely even remember my best friend Eyri anymore. I hope she’s okay, but something tells me she’s not around anymore. Dad went out to get bread, but still hasn’t returned. It’s been an hour.  

 

Why do you do this to us? Why do you leave us here to die so painfully? Why, world? Why don’t you care? I just want answers and safety. We all do. We never asked for this, all we wanted was peace. It’s been taken away from us, and you don’t give a damn? You swore never again after the Holocaust, react, then! Save us!  

12^(th) May 2025-Day 3 

Ghirandza, Nescria 

 

It’s over... Our lives are over with... We’re all gonna die in this cold, bland, dark basement.   
 

\-This is Radio Nescria informing on the closure of the border between Nescria and Bambarska. The neutral nation has closed its border with Nescria, leaving one hundred twenty-six million people in a nation-sized cage whose walls are closing in. Our only hope now is that they’ll have mercy upon us. Godspeed, Nescrians!- 

 

Dad keeps whispering to mom, trying to show he’s not scared, but I know he is. You can see it in his eyes. We all know that our final days will be spent here. I tried to communicate with the boy from across the street, but he was nowhere to be seen. I hope he’s alright. I believe he also knows that the world has turned its back on us, left us to die here in the most gruesome and cruel way imaginable. Please, whoever reads this, tell them I survived. Tell them I’m still around, even though I’m probably not... Tell them about the sixteen-year-old Marianne. Tell them she didn’t die alone in a dark basement. Please, I’m begging you. 

 

Power is out. I’m writing this holding a pencil in one hand and a flashlight in the other. There is a bright orange glow every ten seconds. I’m not sure how long our hiding place will last... Every time a bomb falls close to us, the dust falls from the ceiling. Mom and dad are somehow asleep, but I can’t. I’m sitting at this old dinner table writing this for I don’t even know who. I hope the boy from across the street is okay, but I’m not very certain since a cluster bomb fell near his house, or, what’s left of it. Our food is running out, radio is nothing but static... We all know it’s over, but we hope that it isn’t. God, how I wish someone gave a damn about us... 

 

Hopefully this ends soon. Goodnight, hope to write tomorrow. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13^(th) May 2025-Day 4 

Ghirandza, Nescria 

 

I dreamt of going to the mall with Eyri and my family. We had the time of our lives... We bought some new hoodies, T-shirts, thighs, Eyri even bought a new dress. It was a pretty one, with yellow streaks. We then had lunch at a fast food joint.  

 

Such a beautiful dream was interrupted by an explosion not too far from us. Maybe a block or two away. I looked out the basement window and saw explosions in the city center. My friend Nohi used to live there... I don’t believe she made it out. I hope she did, but I fear my gut is right. I’m becoming more and more numb every day. I’m slowly starting to lose my humanity and empathy. I guess I finally embraced the fact that this is the new normal and that there’s no going back, no matter how much we want it to.  

 

I saw blood on the window of the house that boy lived in. I don’t think he made it. Our house is still among the only ones standing in the neighborhood, but I’m not sure how long that’ll be the case with these new precision bombs. Dad went outside to try scavenge something to ration. It’s been three hours, and he still hasn’t returned. I’m preparing for the worst. The radio broadcast just informed us that things are getting worse and worse.  

 

\-This is the fourth day of the Axis agression on our country. They are advancing on all fronts at a staggering pace. Frendayriya is on the verge of collapse. Reports there are stating that approximately seventy percent of the city is under Axis control. While there is still no information on the losses, we can say pretty surely that our forces are losing a lot more than theirs. World powers are holding a summit, but there is still nothing but sanctions in place. Reports say that around three thousand civilians in Ghirandza alone didn’t make it through the night. May God have mercy on their souls. This is no invasion. They are wiping us out. This is no ethnic cleansing. They want an entire nation to cease to exist. This can only be described as the end of millions... May God be by your side. Good luck, Nescrians!- 

 

My heart is broken, my body is covered in scratches, my mind is traumatized. I can’t keep this up any longer. No one here can. I know it hurts to surrender, but I feel like it’s the only option. I’m not even sure what to think anymore. Dad said, when he finally returned, that he heard someone from Frendayriya say that they saw a kid, not older than seven, wave a makeshift white flag but they shot him nonetheless. These aren’t humans, they’re monsters. If an Axis soldier finds this diary of mine, then know... I hope you and your family go through the same we did, because that’s the only fate you deserve! 

 

Our food is running out. Dad is risking his life every day trying to find something in the ruins of old bakeries or restaurants, but with limited success. Every time he goes out, I prepare for the worst. Mom just keeps sitting on her sleeping bag, staring at the wall like it’s got answers to all her questions. I managed to get myself a look on the situation in our country. We are well and truly encircled.  

 

 

I knew the situation was bad, but this just made me realize how bad it truly was. My country was a cage no one could escape from. That cage was killing more and more innocent souls every day. This isn’t a military operation as the Axis say, it’s a destruction of a nation and its people. This is worse than genocide!  

 

Why can’t my voice be just a little louder? Just loud enough for the world to hear it... 

 

 

 

 

14^(th) May 2025-Day 5 

Ghirandza, Nescria 

 

Our house is gone. A napalm was dropped on our street and engulfed our home, levelling it within minutes. I’m not sure how we survived. I suffered minor burns, but we’re still alive. Except for dad, maybe. I think he’s gone. He went out again to try and find something useful, but it’s been nine hours and he still hasn’t returned. The basement’s ceiling is black now, scorched from the fire, but it’s still keeping us somewhat safe. 

 

I think I found an escape route out of the country, but I’m still not certain. If we were to go south, towards Bambarska, we could somehow migrate through the mountains. It’s challenging and far harder than it sounds, but to me it sounds like a possibility.  

 

 

I consulted about it with mom, but she said it was too risky, that we might not make it out of Ghirandza, let alone out of Nescria. Sadly, it’s true. Nescrian people are being annihilated at every step. We might never even make it out of our block. God, I can’t describe you my fear right now... 

 

They call us terrorists, jihadists, killers... I’m sixteen. I cry when I’m sad, hug my friends, draw, sing, dance... What kind of a terrorist or killer does that? I’m just a normal teenager, not a killer the Axis propaganda calls me! Believe me, believe an innocent soul, not the rigged politicians!  

 

Dad still hasn’t returned. He never will. I know that. It’s all up to mom and me now. She went out to get some food for us. Hopefully she returns. I still hear the explosions outside. I think they’re bombing the city center. Even though it’s miles away, I can still feel the rumbling, the dust is still falling from the ceiling, and even a few cracks began forming in the ceiling and the concrete brick walls of our basement. The radio broadcast has just informed us that this isn’t an invasion, nor a genocide. They are exorcising the entire nation of Nescria! This is nothing but exorcism and exploitation on a nation with twenty-three million innocents!  

 

\-Radio Nescria informing on the latest Axis advances in our country: the Axis have advanced only half as much as in the past days. The shelling and bombing, however, has only increased in the last twenty-four hours. It is estimated that over four thousand people were killed in the attacks the previous day. The UN is holding a summit in which sanctions against the Axis countries should be implemented, but little Nescrians believe in that. We are on our own, and we don’t have much time. Good luck, and may God help you all!- 

 

Mom is back! She seems sick, I must do my best to help her. She’s all I’ve got left now. Hopefully I live to write another day... Goodbye.

15^(th) May 2025-Day 6 

Ghirandza, Nescria 

 

Today would’ve been Eyri’s birthday. Her birthdays were always so fun! We would always play something on her gaming console, pull pranks on boys she invited, play board games and then get into a fight over it... I smiled... For the first time since the war started, I smiled. I feel guilty for it, though. I know she’s not around to smile with me anymore. God, I miss her. I miss her jokes, her laugh... I miss calling her name. Happy birthday, Eyri! 

 

I miss my dad too. Mom told me she found his coat yesterday when she went out to find something to eat. She said it had been pierced with shrapnel. He was probably another victim of a cluster bomb. I remember how he taught me how to play the piano. I just talked with her today. Pointless topics, but enough to distract my mind from the fact that it was raining fire all around us. It’s hard, you know... It’s hard to talk to a person so close to you, knowing that you may not ever see them again. Every day here lasts for a decade. A decade full of pain, terror and trauma.  

 

I can’t stop thinking about the days before the war, before the nightmare began. I miss eating at the dinner table, sleeping in my bed, taking a shower... Can’t remember the last time I’ve taken a nice, hot shower... How did all disappear so swiftly? How has the world suddenly forgotten we exist? I don’t want to know, I just want to return to my normal life. 

 

On the off-chance that I don’t think about normalcy, I think about what I wanted my future to be. I wanted to get married to my boyfriend, Kory. He was the most loving, caring, funniest person I’ve known. Sometimes, it felt like I loved him more than my family. He’s probably gone too, but I don’t want to admit that. He and I would live in a big house with our two kids; one would be a boy named Loka, and the other would be a girl named Kelina. They’d be perfect. They’d love us, and Kory and I would love them back even more. I’d work as an actress, writing books in my spare time, while Kory would open up a small shop.  

 

God, how I miss Kory. I remember our first kiss. It was in the school locker room, after P.E. class. He snuck into the girls’ locker room, knowing I was the last one left. I asked him what he was doing, to which he responded by getting closer, wrapping his hands around me and went lips-first onto mine. I’ll never forget that. 

 

Oh, how I wish I could kiss him one more time. Just once more... I miss you, Kory. I miss him so much! 

 

Eyri and I would like to go for coffee and chat about some girl stuff. We’d talk about our husbands, kids, lives, jobs... all while sipping espresso. It would be a blast, but I know that it can’t happen anymore. 

May 16^(th) 2025-Day 7 

Ghirandza, Nescria 

 

The explosions are starting again, it’s not even six in the morning and they’re already shelling us. Mom is making us tea with the little water we have left. This basement is so stained and stinky... I haven’t taken a shower in a week, my dark hair is all messy, I smell of sweat and dirt... I miss hot showers. I used to sing in the shower when I was little, used to think about my boyfriend when I entered my teens... It’s all gone now, though. I just want to take a hot shower just once more, is that too much to ask for? 

 

Tea is good. It tastes good. Forest fruit. I’m savoring every droplet of the tea like it’s liquid gold. These were the last two bags we had left in the basement. “You can drink mine while I come back.” Mom said, handed me her white mug with a flower pattern and left the basement. I don’t wanna drink her tea, it’s not fair if I do.  

 

She went outside to hopefully scavenge something for us to eat and drink, maybe craft weapons in case the Axis soldiers come knocking, which they will. It’s just a matter of time.  

 

“This is Laeki Nurfurmino, reporting from Ghirandza. Here with me are two brave and patriotic soldiers ready to fight the enemy for our sovereignty, for our lives, for our freedom.”  

 

Nescria’s only voice echoed from the radio. Laeki is my current idol, she’s saying things no one dares to. She is an incredible and heroic young woman, maybe a couple years older than I am.  

 

“Henru, what do you have to say to all the Nescrians listening?” Laeki asked a soldier. “I want to assure my people that we will fight until the bitter end, but their ends will be even more bitter!” the soldier determinedly responded to her question.  

 

I can only imagine Laeki’s thoughts... She knows she’s gonna die brutally and painfully, knows she’s marked for death, but still brave, heroic nonetheless. I admire her more than my words can describe.  

 

They say war is the best time to profit. How do you profit? How can you? How dare you? We’re not numbers, but living, breathing human beings with hopes, dreams and families! How morally corrupt must a person be to profit from human blood?  

 

I can hear them. Rainstorms. They have a distinctive roar. I think this was an N85 Hyena. Probably Axfian. There it goes, an explosion in the financial district. Two, three, four... Eighteen. I can only imagine how many lives were cut short in these thirty seconds. Lives like mine, lives like yours... Happy ones, families, children... I’m becoming numb to this. I think about them, but I feel less and less pain about them. Like I’m losing my humanity. I hate it. 

 

I used to be so empathetic, so caring, always there to help my friends who needed my help. Now, I’m losing those traits that make me human, that make me a girl, that make me Marianne.  

 

I remember the time Eyri injured her hand on a fence post. She bled severely. I quickly took a towel and pressed on her wound to stop the bleeding. Even the paramedics, who later arrived, said I surprised them with my courage and knowledge. I watched a lot of medical dramas before the war. I guess I learned a thing or two there.

Long-time lurker, first-time ""buy once, cry once"" buyer here. I'm about to pull the trigger on what I hope will be my lifetime espresso setup and would love some sanity checks from the community.

**Current situation:**

* Nespresso Vertuo user (for convenience due to previous lifestyle up to now travelling 80% of the year internationally) looking to upgrade to ""real"" espresso (due to recent life changes and remote working at home)
* Based in Spain (Madrid)
* Appreciate good ristrettos, espressos and lattes
* Prioritizing long-term quality and aesthetics over budget (without making me buy the Weber EG1 and Lamarzocco please)
* 4 coffee drinks daily, half of them milk-based

**The planned setup:**

* **Machine**: Lelit Bianca V3 (Around €2,400 regular). I saw the Elizabeth but Bianca is a lot sexier!
* **Grinder**: DF83 V3 with SSP HU burrs pre-installed (€1,200-1,400)
* **Total**: \~€3,600-3,800 depending on deals

**Why these choices:**

* Love the Bianca's aesthetics and the flow control paddle seems perfect for experimentation
* DF83 + SSP HU should be endgame-level grinding without needing future upgrades
* Want to avoid the ""upgrade spiral"" - buy once, use for 10+ years

**My specific questions:**

1. Am I crazy to go straight from Nespresso to this level, or is it actually smarter to skip the intermediate steps?
2. Any Spaniards here with experience buying DF83 from European retailers vs local options?
3. Is the SSP HU upgrade worth it from day one, or should I start with stock burrs?
4. Anyone regret going with the Bianca over Elizabeth/other dual boilers?

I understand the learning curve will be steep but I'm excited about it

This represents a pretty big investment for me, so any real-world experiences, alternative suggestions, or ""wish I'd known"" advice would be hugely appreciated!

I still have not done a thorough research on other tools & accessories needed, which I will not underestimate as they will also represent a big chunk of money.

The Years We Dreamed Out Loud

Birth & The First Year
Age 23
BIRTHING CENTER: ROOM 4 - 6:31 AM


Danika was sweating through the contraction, her hands gripping the sheet like it owed her something.

Joaquim stood behind her, pressing his hand to her back, whispering breath cues they’d practiced.

“Breathe in. 
Hold. 
Now down. 
Down.
Good, Danika.”

Tears rolled down her temples.
But she didn’t scream.
She bore.

And when the child came-small and fierce and wrinkled and perfect-Danika reached for Joaquim’s hand before the doctor placed the baby on her chest.

“He has your mouth,” 
she whispered.

Joaquim’s knees buckled.

“And his own name.”
----

BIRTHING CENTER: TWO DAYS LATER -ROOM 3 - 11:17 PM


Selene was calm.

Steady.

Softer than Danika, but just as warrior-shaped.

Dashiell sat beside her, one hand over hers, the other clenched in his lap.

“You ready?” 
the nurse asked.

He nodded.

Once.

The baby came quickly.
Cried immediately.

And Selene, without being asked, looked to Dashiell and said:

“Hold her.”

He did.

He’d never shaken harder in his life.
○○●○○

DONNACHAIDH-BARNES HOME: WEEKS LATER


Two bassinets.

One in each room.

Then both moved into the main bedroom when the boys realized no one was sleeping otherwise.

The babies’ names:

• Micah Idris Donnachaidh-Barnes (Joaquim’s biological son)

• Eira Simone Barnes-Donnachaidh (Dashiell’s biological daughter)

They alternated bottles.

Split night shifts.

Took turns crying when they couldn’t figure it out.

At one point, Dashiell found Joaquim asleep in the laundry room, curled next to a basket of warm onesies, still holding the bottle in his hand.

He didn’t wake him.

Just covered him with a blanket.
-----

KITCHEN: THREE MONTHS LATER


Micah had colic.

Eira had discovered her lungs.

Joaquim poured cereal into a bowl.

Missed.
Started crying.

Dashiell took the box gently from his hand.

“Go nap. 
I’ll hold the morning.”

“You’re already holding everything.”

“Then let me hold you.”

And he did.

All morning.
All year.

●●○○○



The First Day
Age 5 (Children) / Age 28 (J & D)
DONNACHAIDH-BARNES HOME: EARLY MORNING


Two backpacks lined up at the front door-one navy blue with planets, the other sunshine yellow with tiny owls.

Micah, now five, checked his zipper five times.

He wore sneakers so new the soles still squeaked.

Eira, braided hair and gold star earrings, stood with her arms crossed, serious as a librarian.

“I’m not gonna cry,” 
she announced.

“Me neither,” 
Micah said.

From the hallway, Joaquim (28) peeked out, wiping a tear from his eye.

“Too late.”

Dashiell (28) laughed from the kitchen.

“You crying again?”

“I’ve earned this cry.”

“You cried when Micah blinked.”

“It was a powerful blink.”
-----


KITCHEN: MOMENTS LATER


Pancakes on the griddle.

Backpacks checked again.

Lunches packed with sticky notes folded like origami hearts.

Joaquim slid two plates onto the table.

Micah climbed into Dashiell’s lap.

Eira hugged Joaquim’s leg like a koala.

There was no music.

Just morning.

Real and earned.
-----


SCHOOL PARKING LOT: 8:42 AM

The air smelled like crayons and sunscreen.

Micah held Dashiell’s hand.

Eira squeezed Joaquim’s.

When they reached the gates, they paused.

“You guys ready?” 
Dashiell asked.

Micah nodded.
Eira said:

“Don’t worry. 
We’ll come back.”

Then they ran.

Backpacks bouncing.
Shoes flashing.

And didn’t look back.

Not because they didn’t love them.

But because they knew they were loved.
-----

CAR - SILENCE


Dashiell stared straight ahead.

Joaquim wept behind sunglasses.

“You okay?” 
D asked.

“We did it.”

“We’re doing it.”

“I still see the babies.”

“I still see you.
And I’m still saying yes.”

Joaquim reached over.

Took his hand.

And in the quiet between the car seats;

They dreamed the next years out loud.

The Questions That Were Always Ours
Micah & Eira - Age 6 / J & D - Age 29
BEDROOM FLOOR: RAINY AFTERNOON


The storm was soft.

Not dramatic.

Just steady enough to keep everyone in socks and blankets.
Eira lay on the rug surrounded by books.

Micah knelt beside her, organizing his dinosaur figurines in height order.

Dashiell stood in the doorway with a juice pouch in each hand.

Joaquim sat on the bed, reading an article on silent reading periods in early classrooms.

“Pappa,” 
Micah said.

Joaquim looked up.

“Yeah, bub?”

Micah squinted at a velociraptor’s belly.

“Was I always yours?”

Silence.

Not the heavy kind.

The kind where the soul steps in the room first.

Eira looked up too.

“Yeah. 

And… who’s my mommy?”

Dashiell crossed the room and sat beside them.

“Come sit,” 
he said.

The kids climbed into their laps, one each.

Joaquim looked at Dashiell.

No panic.
Only readiness.

“You weren’t in our bellies,” Dashiell began.

“But you were in our plans.”

Eira whispered:

“Was there a lady?”

“Two,” 
Joaquim smiled.

“Two brave, kind women who helped us carry you into the world. 

But even before them…

there were your aunties.”

Micah blinked.

“Auntie Amaria?”

“Yes. 
Her egg helped create you.”

“So she’s my…”

“She’s part of your beginning,”
Joaquim said gently.
“But I’m your father. 
And you were always mine.”

Dashiell added:
“And Auntie Fraya helped us make Eira.
She gave a piece of herself so I could carry you.”

Eira looked at the ceiling for a while.

Then whispered:

“That’s kind of like magic.”

“It is magic,” 
Dashiell said.

“But it’s also love.”

“The real kind,” 
Joaquim added.

“The kind you build.”

The Map We Gave Them
Micah & Eira - Age 6 / J & D - Age 29

 LIVING ROOM: SUNDAY AFTERNOON


There was paper everywhere.
Butcher paper rolled across the floor.

Markers in every color.

Photo printouts. 

Tape.
Scissors. 

Laughter.

Micah wrote his name at the top in bold green letters.

Eira surrounded hers with gold stars.

Dashiell held up a drawing of Auntie Fraya with cartoonishly long legs and a firefighter helmet.

“You gave her my boots,” 
he laughed.

“She’s tall in my memory,” 
Eira said.

Joaquim rolled out a second scroll of paper.

“This one’s for your other family lines.

Amaria. 
Selene. 
Danika. 
Everyone who helped.”

Micah tilted his head.

“Even the people we never met?”

“Especially them,” 
Dashiell said.

“Because their love lives through you.”

They glued down a photo of Selene holding Eira in the hospital.

A letter from Danika signed: 

“You were carried with care, not obligation.”

Joaquim wrote in calligraphy beneath it:

Love begins in the courage to carry.

Family begins when we never set each other down.
-----

KITCHEN: LATER THAT NIGHT


The maps were pinned to the hallway walls like art.

Eira traced the paths with her fingers.

Micah made stickers that read: 

""I came from brave people.”

Over dinner, 
Eira asked:

“Do I belong in two places?”

Joaquim set his fork down.

“You belong in all the places that made you.”

“But where’s my home?”

Dashiell looked at her and smiled.

“Wherever we’re waiting when you come through the door.”

○●○●○



Roots in Every Direction
Micah & Eira - Age 6
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL: CLASSROOM 2B - MORNING


Construction paper trees lined the back wall.

Markers, scissors, and glue sticks littered the tables.

Posters read:

“Every family is a forest.”

Micah stood in a dinosaur-print button-up.

Eira wore a sparkly blue jumper and purple sneakers.

Their backpack zippers clinked as they walked in, carrying tubes.
Other kids had drawings.

Some with stick figures.
Some with only three names.
Some with ""mom"" and ""dad"" written over and over.

Eira rolled out her map across two desks.

It had branches in five directions.

Photos. 
Hearts.

A small cartoon of Selene with angel wings and glitter-glue hair.

Micah set his down beside hers.

Big block letters said:

""My family is not one line. 
It's a web of love.""

One of the boys pointed.

“Where’s your mom?”

Micah blinked.

“We have two.”

“Two dads?”

“Yeah. 
And two aunties who gave us our beginnings.”

The teacher, Ms. Kara, knelt beside them.

“Micah, would you like to share your tree?”

He nodded.

“Okay. 
This is me.

My dad Joa helped make me with Auntie Amaria.

But Danika carried me. 

She gave me nine months of warm.

And my papa D? 

He’s the one who stayed up when I cried all night.

He’s where I live.”

Eira added:

“I was carried by Selene.

And I got born with my hand already reaching for Micah.

That’s how twins of the heart work.”

There was silence.

Then a girl near the back said:

“My grandma raised me. 
That’s kind of the same.”

Micah nodded.

“Family isn’t who made you.
It’s who stays.”

Later that day, the teacher emailed Joaquim and Dashiell:

“Your children taught the whole class how love works today.”

Where They Learned to Belong
Age 29 -That Evening
DONNACHAIDH-BARNES HOME - NIGHT


Dinner had been quiet.

The kids were full of stories and noodles.

Eira fell asleep in the hallway with a crayon still in her hand.

Micah curled into the couch with a book he could now read himself.

Dashiell cleaned the kitchen slowly.

His bare feet padded softly across the tile.

Joaquim leaned against the counter, scrolling through the email from the teacher again.

“Did you read this part?” 
he asked.

“‘Micah said: 
My papa is where I live.’”

Dashiell didn’t speak.
His hands paused in the dishwater.

“D…”

“Yeah?”

“We did it.”

“We’re doing it.”

“No, I mean-
They know.

They know who they are.
Where they came from.
And they aren’t confused.

They’re anchored.”

Dashiell turned.

His eyes were glassy.

Not in grief.

In a kind of relief that only comes once you realize the worst never came.

“You remember when I said I wasn’t sure I could give you everything?” 

he whispered.
Joaquim nodded.

“You gave me more.”

They didn’t hug.
They didn’t need to.

They stood there,
shoulders touching,
two mugs warming in their hands-while their children slept down the hall under names they made, under maps they drew,
under a roof they built
out of truth.

“They didn’t teach us who to be.
They taught us how to stand still inside love.

And in that stillness, we learned we were already enough.”

The Questions Outside Our Door
Micah & Eira -Age 9 / J & D - Age 32
KITCHEN: SATURDAY MORNING


The pancakes were too brown on one side.

Micah was sulking into his cup of orange juice.

Eira was stirring maple syrup into her oatmeal even though she didn’t like it that sweet.

Joaquim noticed first.

“Okay. 
Who cracked the quiet?”

Eira looked up.

“Someone at school said it’s weird that we don’t have moms.”

Dashiell leaned on the counter.

“What’d you say?”

“I said we have two dads.

And aunties.
And a birth angel.
And a tree that goes in five directions.”

Micah muttered:

“They said that wasn’t real.”

Silence.

“They said we’re missing something.”

---

BACKYARD: MOMENTS LATER

They sat in a circle on the grass.
Warm sun.

Cool shadows from the fig tree.

Joaquim placed the old family map in the middle.

Dashiell sat with one knee raised, arm around Micah.

“You’re not missing anything,” Dashiell said.

“You were given extra.”

“Not everyone gets that.”

Eira frowned.

“But what if I don’t know what to say next time?”

Joaquim nodded slowly.

“You don’t have to argue.
You just have to know.
That your love is real.
That your story is true.”

Micah looked up.

“Can we write our own answer?”

“To what?” 

Dashiell asked.

“To people who don’t get it.”

They spent the afternoon writing it.

Together.

A family charter.

Not to defend themselves-but to anchor themselves.

The Questions Outside Our Door
The Family Charter
Micah & Eira - Age 9
LIVING ROOM FLOOR: SUNDAY EVENING


The sky outside was soft with sunset.

The hallway glowed gold.

The kitchen smelled faintly of basil and lemon.

Micah sat cross-legged, flipping his marker cap between his fingers.

Eira had the good paper-the thick kind, the kind that didn’t bleed.

Joaquim leaned against the couch, notebook in his lap.

Dashiell was on the floor, legs long, sleeves rolled, letting the kids lead.

Micah began:

“Rule one-our family is real. 
Even if someone else doesn’t get it.”

Eira nodded.

“Rule two-love isn’t a shape. 
It’s a presence.”

Joaquim added:

“Rule three-no one gets to vote on your belonging.”

Dashiell smiled.

“Rule four-we tell our story. 
We don’t hide it.”

Micah drew a web with four names in the center:

Micah. Eira. Pappa. Dad.

Eira wrote in looping cursive:

“We were carried. 
We were chosen. 
We were dreamed into existence.”

They all signed it.
Four signatures.
One house.

No apologies.

Joaquim pinned it to the hallway wall, not next to the maps.

But above them.

Because this wasn’t origin.

This was identity.

The Answer Was Always Ours
Micah & Eira - Age 9
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL -RECESS COURTYARD-MIDDAY


The sun was high, and the grass smelled like stomped clover.

Four-square bounced in one corner.

Some kids huddled around trading cards.

Micah sat on the concrete ledge, sketching a velociraptor with wings.

Eira was braiding a friend’s hair beneath the jungle gym.

A kid from another class walked up.

Nick.

A little louder than necessary.
A little too confident for his understanding.

“So which one of your dads is, like... the real one?”

Micah didn’t blink.
He didn’t flinch.

He closed his notebook.

Turned.

“Both of them.”

Nick laughed.

“But only one made you, right?”

Eira stood up.
Wiped her hands.

Walked over.

“One carried his blood.
The other carried his name.
Both carry his heart.”

Micah added:

“We have two dads.
Two aunties.
Two women who carried us safely to the world.
And four names behind us when we walk.”

“We’re not missing anything.”
“We’re built different.”

Nick didn’t know what to say.

So he walked away.

Micah reopened his sketchbook.
Eira sat down beside him.

“That was good,” 
she said.

“We don’t whisper who we are,” Micah replied.

Becoming in Their Own Colors
Micah & Eira - Age 10
HOUSEHOLD - LATE EVENING


Rain ticked against the windows.

The hallway smelled like cocoa and clean laundry.

R&B hummed softly from the kitchen.

Micah sat on his bedroom floor, surrounded by sketchbooks.

Dinosaurs still featured, but now they wore cloaks, armor, crowns.

He stared at a half-finished page-
a dragon with wings like a quilt of all his family’s last names.

He flipped it shut.

“Dad?” 
he called.

Joaquim appeared in the doorway.

“Yeah, bub?”

“Can I be something you didn’t expect?”

Joaquim blinked.
Then walked in.

Sat beside him.

“You already are.”

Micah smiled, nervous.

“I like drawing girls.
But not how they look.
Just how they… carry story.

Is that weird?”

“No.
That’s art.

That’s you.”

Eira sat cross-legged on the kitchen counter, chin in her hands.

Dashiell stirred something in a pot.

“Papa?”
“Yeah?”

“How do you know if you’re supposed to be loud or quiet?”

“Depends.”

“On what?”

“On if you’re asking the world to see you; or if you’re just finally seeing yourself.”

She was quiet.

Then:

“I think I’m loud.
But only in poems.”

Dashiell kissed her forehead.

“Then we’ll make room for your poems.”

When They Stepped Into the Light
Micah & Eira - Age 10
COMMUNITY CENTER: ART EXHIBIT - FRIDAY NIGHT


The room smelled like citrus cleaner and gallery paste.

Micah’s drawing hung dead center on the far wall.

A dragon-not fierce, but reverent.

Its wings were made of quilt squares:

family names, symbols of their aunties, fire, flight, birth, stars, and a compass pointing to home.

Below it, the title read:

“The Story That Carried Me.”

People stopped.
Stared.

Whispered.

Micah stood to the side, arms crossed, face burning.

Joaquim knelt down beside him.

“You okay?”

“I think I just showed everyone what’s inside me.”

“And?”

“It didn’t break me.”

----


SCHOOL GYMNASIUM: POETRY NIGHT - ONE WEEK LATER


The mic squeaked once.

Then stilled.

Eira stood on the small wooden stage, braids pinned back, sleeves rolled.

Her poem was called:

“In Case You’re Still Wondering.”

I don’t have a mom.

I have women who carried my name like song.

I have dads who taught me quiet doesn’t mean small.

I have poems where other kids have questions.

I’m not missing anything.
I’m built like truth.

Like rhythm.

Like story that’s already been sung once and still wants to dance.

The room went still.

Then wild.

Dashiell had to wipe his eyes before clapping.

Joaquim didn’t even bother pretending.


🔊ADULT EIRA

“That was the first night I stopped asking permission.
And they were the first ones who told me I didn’t need to.”

----

DONNACHAIDH-BARNES HOME - LIVING ROOM - 10:41 PM


The house was dark, but not asleep.

A nightlight glowed in the hallway.

Rain tapped at the windows again.

Soft. Gentle. Familiar.

Micah’s sketchbook lay open on the coffee table.

The dragon’s wings unfinished-he was still adding new squares.

Eira’s folded poem sat beside it, dotted with fingerprints of stage light and sweat.

Joaquim sat on the couch, a blanket over his lap, eyes on the dim ceiling.

Dashiell entered with two mugs-cocoa and cinnamon, just like always.

He set one down without a word.

Then sat.

They didn’t speak for a long time.
Then,

“They’re telling the story now,” Joaquim whispered.

Dashiell nodded.

“We were just the opening lines.”

Silence again.

But this time it held legacy.

“Do you think they’ll remember how hard we tried?” 
Dashiell asked.

“No.”

“No?”

“I think they’ll remember how easy it felt to be loved.”

And that?

That was everything.


🔊ADULT JOQUIM

“I asked the world for a place to belong.

It gave me a man with calloused hands and a soft laugh.

And two children who walk into rooms already knowing they are whole.

That’s the miracle.

Not that we made it through,
But that we made a home where no one had to earn love.”",1,1753876659.0,ThreeBlessingsWorld,0,1.0,False

The Rise of Bitcoin ATMs and the Magic of Our QR Code Maker","[bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://preview.redd.it/5vei50ti30gf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=40dbb50c4c43dcf78259f5ad5091b0d7110c5b36)

Step aside, old-school banking — the age of Bitcoin is here, and it’s got a shiny new toy: **Bitcoin ATMs**. Yes, those magical machines that look like regular ATMs but dispense *digital gold* instead of paper fiat. They're popping up everywhere — gas stations, convenience stores, even in that sketchy 24-hour laundromat with the blinking neon sign. Wherever there's Wi-Fi and a wall socket, there could be a Bitcoin ATM waiting to beam satoshis into your wallet.

But here's the thing: while Bitcoin ATMs are fun, fast, and futuristic, they rely on one unsung hero to really shine — the **QR code**. You can’t just shout your wallet address at the machine and hope it understands. Nope. You need that sleek little square of pixelated magic to tell the ATM, ""Hey, send the BTC *here*, please.""

That’s where we come in.

Introducing the ultimate tool in your Bitcoin arsenal: the [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker app**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com). Whether you’re withdrawing, depositing, or simply showing off your public address at the local crypto meetup, our app makes it ridiculously easy to generate flawless, scannable QR codes in seconds.

# Bitcoin ATM + QR Code = Instant Sats

Using a Bitcoin ATM is as easy as 1-2-QR. You walk up, punch in how much Bitcoin you want to buy or sell, scan your wallet address (via our super clean QR code), and boom — your transaction is off to the blockchain races. But if your QR code is blurry, outdated, or formatted wrong, you’re going to have a bad time. That’s why our app is designed to keep things smooth, snappy, and 100% compatible with all major wallets and ATMs.

You can even customize your QR code with a Bitcoin logo, adjust the pixel size, and make it look as sharp as a cold wallet key etched in steel. We’ve already helped users generate over **45 million QR codes** — and counting. That's more QR action than a sushi menu in downtown Tokyo.

# Great for ATMs, Even Better for Merchants

Let’s say you own a coffee shop that accepts Bitcoin (because you’re awesome like that). Slap a QR code on the counter, and let your customers scan and pay in a flash. No point-of-sale hardware. No banking middlemen. Just clean, direct Bitcoin transactions — powered by our app.

Want to accept payments from around the world? Use the Bitcoin QR Code Maker to generate a static or dynamic QR for a set amount. Share the link, embed it on your site, or print it on a T-shirt. Boom — international crypto commerce in style.

# Final Thoughts

Bitcoin ATMs are turning everyday locations into mini crypto exchanges, and QR codes are the bridge between you and the blockchain. So next time you're face-to-face with a Bitcoin ATM, make sure you’ve got your QR game strong.

Visit [**https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) and start generating QR codes that don’t just work — they *wow*.",1,1753876587.0,BitcoinJumble,0,1.0,False

1md4ims,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRealBollywoodTea/comments/1md4ims/the_ultimate_bollywood_tea_index_az_part_b1/,"The Ultimate Bollywood Tea Index (A-Z) PART ""B1""","**1) Bipasha Basu 🦄**

# Bipasha Basu: The ""Plastic"" Siren Whose Career Crashed & Burned!

Forget ""bold and beautiful,"" the true ""tea"" on Bipasha Basu paints a picture of a once-hyped starlet whose desperate choices and alleged self-sabotage led to a spectacular flameout. She's less ""goddess"" and more ""trainwreck"" if you believe the whispers.

# ""Plastic"" Face, Fake Body & The ""Botched"" Legacy

Let's not mince words: Reddit's brutal truth about Bipasha often starts with her alleged extensive plastic surgeries. Forget ""natural beauty"" – the consensus is a heavily ""sculpted"" face that's been tweaked, pulled, and filled beyond recognition. Users ruthlessly dissect her pre- and post-fame photos, pointing out drastic changes that left her looking ""unrecognizable"" and, according to some, ""botched."" Her once unique features are now just another example of Bollywood's surgical obsession. The whispers suggest she's perpetually ""under the knife,"" chasing a youth and perfection that's purely artificial.

# The ""Slut-Shamed"" Siren & The Ronaldo Hookup

Her early career wasn't ""bold""; it was ""scandalous."" That infamous Calida underwear ad with Dino Morea wasn't just ""sultry""; it was ""pornographic"" for its time, leading to actual protests and calls for her arrest! This set the tone for a career where she was constantly viewed through a ""sexualized"" lens, ultimately ""slut-shamed"" by an industry that profited from her image while judging her for it.

And the Cristiano Ronaldo hookup? Please. That wasn't just ""cozy""; it was a full-blown ""PR stunt gone wrong"" that left her looking desperate to break into international fame by latching onto a global superstar. The photos, according to the brutal ""tea,"" spoke volumes, undermining her relationships back home.

# The ""Kaali Billi"" Slap & Petty Rivalries

Her ""fight"" with Kareena Kapoor on Ajnabee wasn't just a ""catfight""; it was an alleged physical altercation where Kareena slapped her and ruthlessly called her ""Kaali Billi"" (black cat). This wasn't just about costumes; it was about industry hierarchy and alleged jealousy, proving Bipasha was always seen as an ""outsider"" who could be easily put in her place.

# ""Jism"": A ""Bold"" Choice or Career Suicide?

While Jism made her famous, the brutal truth is that it typecast her as the ""sex object."" Producers, according to the ""tea,"" saw her as nothing more than a ""sultry vamp,"" limiting her roles and ultimately cornering her into a niche that quickly lost its appeal. She might have thought it was ""bold,"" but it essentially became her ""career coffin.""

# The Amar Singh Tapes: ""Dirty Talk"" & Disgraced Denial

The Amar Singh tapes controversy was far more than just ""whispers."" It was a public humiliation where alleged ""dirty talks"" with a powerful politician were leaked. Her frantic denials and claims of voice mimicry did little to quell the widely held belief that it was her. This incident, for many, solidified her image as someone involved in the ""murkier side of Bollywood.""

# The ""Husband Clause"" - Career Suicide & Desperation!

Here's the most brutal ""tea"" about her career implosion: After marrying Karan Singh Grover (who's allegedly less than a D-list actor), Bipasha reportedly started demanding that he be cast alongside her in every single film. This utterly delusional ""husband clause,"" according to industry insiders and Reddit's brutal honesty, was the final nail in her career's coffin. Producers, rightly, saw it as an absurd, desperate move and simply stopped calling. She sacrificed a once-promising career for a perceived ""toy boy,"" and the industry swiftly moved on.

# Child Labour Tweet: Tone-Deaf & Entitled

That 2011 tweet, showing young girls tying her shoelaces, wasn't just a ""misunderstanding""; it was a tone-deaf, entitled display that rightfully earned her massive backlash and accusations of promoting child labor. It exposed a disconnect from reality that further chipped away at any remaining public goodwill.

**2) Bobby Deol🦄**

# Bobby Deol: The ""Entitled Nepo Baby"" Who Drank His Career Away, Now Riding a Vanga-Given High!

Forget the ""comeback kid"" narrative. The brutal ""tea"" on **Bobby Deol** reveals a privileged nepo product who squandered his chances, spiraled into alleged alcoholism, and whose current ""success"" is largely a fluke of a meme and a director's specific vision, not genuine talent.

# The ""Born Rich, Stayed Rich"" Lie & Tania's Money

Don't buy the ""struggler"" sob story. The harsh truth, widely circulated, is that Bobby Deol, despite his career nosedive, never truly suffered. Why? Because his wife, **Tania Deol, is the sole heir to a multi-millionaire fortune.** The ""tea"" alleges that Bobby was effectively **living off her family's immense wealth**, with whispers even suggesting she was ""funneling some of her Dad's money into Bobby's movie"" at one point. This isn't a comeback from rock bottom; it's a pampered playboy's temporary redemption, financed by his rich in-laws.

# The Drunken ""DJ Disaster"" & McDonald's Shoe-Thrower

Before his so-called ""resurrection,"" Bobby Deol was a **national joke.** The infamous **DJ gig in Delhi** where he allegedly played the *Gupt* title track *for two hours straight*, leading to the crowd demanding **refunds**, wasn't a ""meme"" then; it was a brutal, public humiliation. Further ""tea"" recounts an incident where a **drunk Bobby allegedly threw his shoe at a closed McDonald's door** after closing hours, revealing a privileged, entitled rage that many already suspected. He wasn't just depressed; he was, according to the whispers, a **""haggard,"" ""out of shape,"" and ""out of it"" alcoholic** who admitted his kids questioned why he never went to work. This wasn't a career slump; it was a self-inflicted, boozy abyss.

# ""Jab We Met"" Loss & Kareena's Revenge

The story of Bobby losing *Jab We Met* isn't just about ""missing out."" The brutal ""tea"" is that **Kareena Kapoor couldn't** ***stand*** **him or his wife, Tania.** Rumors suggest a petty feud, possibly stemming from Bobby making a ""pass at Bebo"" or his wife being ""rude to Babita."" The bottom line? **Kareena allegedly got him ""replaced"" in a film that became a cult classic**, effectively burying his already sputtering career even deeper. He got a front-row seat to the success he almost had, all thanks to his own alleged missteps and industry rivalries.

# ""Lord Bobby"": A Meme, Not an Actor

Let's be blunt: his ""comeback"" started not because of some hidden acting prowess, but because **the internet turned him into a hilarious meme.** ""Lord Bobby"" was born out of his absurd old movie clips and DJ debacle, creating a ironic fondness that paved the way for small roles. His ""acting"" in *Animal*? Many on Reddit still call it **""mediocre,"" ""stoic,"" and reliant on his beard to ""hide the lack of expressions.""** He's not an acting powerhouse; he's a beneficiary of dark internet humor and a director (Sandeep Reddy Vanga) who brilliantly utilized his blankness for a specific, unblinking villain. He was a meme, then he got lucky.

# Alleged Infidelity: ""Just Like His Father and Brother""

While his wife stuck by him, the ""tea"" from his darkest phase includes **allegations of extra-marital affairs**, specifically with socialites like **Priya Chatwal and Kalyani Chawla**. Blind items from that period cruelly implied he had **""turned out to be just like his father and his older brother (in terms of infidelity),""** cementing his place in the Deol family's controversial legacy of womanizing. His ""cleaned up"" act for his kids? Just an admission of how far he'd fallen.

# Nepotism's Enduring Waste

Ultimately, the most brutal ""tea"" on Bobby Deol is that he's the quintessential example of **nepotism squandered.** He had the looks, the surname, and the massive launch, but, according to critical ""tea,"" he was a **""bad actor"" with ""less charisma""** who made ""bad film choices."" His initial success was ""only baap aur bhai ke fans ke badolat,"" and once Hrithik Roshan arrived, it was ""game over."" His career was essentially **""only 5 years"" long** before it dissolved into a drunken, entitled oblivion, only to be resurrected by a meme and a director who saw potential in his perceived ""nothingness.""

**3) Bhumi Pednekar🦄**

# Bhumi Pednekar: The ""Social Media Warrior"" Who's Allegedly a Toxic, Entitled, Plastic Nightmare Behind the Scenes!

Forget the carefully curated ""natural talent"" and ""body positive"" advocate. The unfiltered, brutal truth about Bhumi Pednekar, as whispered and shouted in the darkest corners of Bollywood gossip, paints a picture of a calculated, entitled, and ultimately unpleasant individual whose entire persona is a carefully constructed façade.

# The ""Surgical Monster"" & Her Unnatural Face

The most vicious ""tea"" revolves around her extreme and relentless alleged plastic surgery. She didn't just ""lose weight""; she underwent a ""full-blown facial reconstruction"" that has left her looking ""unnaturally gaunt"" and ""completely unrecognizable"" from her debut. Reddit doesn't hold back, declaring her face is now ""more plastic than human,"" with ""distracting lips,"" ""frozen expressions,"" and a look that's ""different in every picture"" because the fillers and tweaks are constantly ""settling."" The cruelest whispers suggest she's succumbed to ""body dysmorphia,"" endlessly chasing an unattainable, generic ""glam"" ideal, ruining her unique features in the process. Her ""lips are doing more acting than her"" in recent projects, making her ""unwatchable"" for many.

# ""Toxic As They Come"" - The True Off-Screen Persona

This is where the ""tea"" gets truly brutal. Forget the sweet image; numerous ""insider"" accounts describe Bhumi as ""toxic as they come"" and ""super bossy on sets.""

* Cruel to Staff: One widely circulated story alleges she ""screamed and yelled"" at a spot boy who mispronounced a word, mocking him in front of everyone and forcing him to repeat it. Another account claims she's ""the most Chindiest person in Bollywood,"" meticulously counting vegetables for her own food, and making her staff arrange their own meals while being ""underpaid."" She allegedly wouldn't even fetch her own coffee and would ""yell if it wasn't served on time.""
* Narcissistic & Insecure: She's described as ""self-obsessed"" with an ""ego bigger than Megastars."" This alleged insecurity also extends to her appearance, with ""tea"" claiming she'd ""shout"" if someone looked better than her and even told her staff to ""dress down"" at events to not outshine her. She supposedly has ""zero sense of dressing"" and her own Instagram is ""cringe"" because she has ""zero social media game"" and relies on others for it.
* Rude & Entitled: Users who've encountered her describe her as having a ""rude persona"" and being ""extremely difficult to work with,"" with an ""attitude about everything."" The perception is she's ""bitchy and mean girl"" and thinks she's ""the second coming of Nargis Dutt.""

# The ""YRF Insider"" Lie & Phony ""Outsider"" Narrative

Her ""rags-to-riches"" story? Pure fiction, according to the brutal ""tea."" She wasn't a struggling outsider; she was an ""assistant casting director at YRF for six years."" This gave her ""privileged access"" and ""insider connections"" that actual outsiders could only dream of. The ""tea"" suggests she leveraged this internal position to secure her debut, making her just another ""nepotism beneficiary"" under a different guise. She came from ""wealth and political backing"" and simply ""managed to avoid being labeled with nepotism tags"" while still getting an unfair advantage. Some even hint that as a casting director, she herself might have been involved in the ""creepy"" aspects of the industry, given her YRF association.

# ""Preachy"" Persona & Fake Activism

Her ""social message"" films and ""body positivity"" sermons are seen as a ""calculated, hypocritical PR gimmick"" that rings hollow. The brutal truth is that she preaches acceptance while allegedly undergoing extreme transformations herself. It's perceived as a way to gain critical acclaim and awards, without genuine conviction, making her come across as ""preachy"" and ""annoying.""

# ""Shady"" Dating & ""Flirting"" with Disaster

Her current secret relationship with Yash Kataria is just another piece of her carefully controlled image. The ""tea"" suggests she maintains this privacy to keep a ""single and available"" façade for career reasons, or due to other ""shady connections"" that she doesn't want publicized. There are even whispers from a former employee that Bhumi was ""hooking up with Jackky Bhagnani"" at one point, and allegedly fired a staff member who was being flirted with by Ibrahim Ali Khan, revealing a deep insecurity and ruthless streak in her personal interactions.

**4) Bhumika Chawla🦄**

# Bhumika Chawla: The ""Tere Naam"" Wonder Who ""Disappeared"" & Her Alleged Bad Choices!

Forget the innocent charm of her *Tere Naam* days. The brutal ""tea"" on **Bhumika Chawla** paints a picture of an actress who got a golden ticket to Bollywood but then somehow **""self-sabotaged""** her career, with whispers ranging from bad choices to a ""creepy"" husband.

# The ""One-Hit Wonder"" Who Couldn't Capitalize

Despite a massive, industry-shaking hit like *Tere Naam* (2003) opposite Salman Khan, Bhumika is consistently labeled a **""one-hit wonder""** in Bollywood. The brutal truth, according to Reddit's ""tea,"" is she **failed to capitalize on that initial success.** Her subsequent Hindi films were largely flops, leading to her quick ""disappearance"" from the mainstream Hindi scene. The question repeatedly asked is: **""Why did her Bollywood career not take off?""** The answer often points to a perceived lack of ambition, poor script choices, or simply failing to connect with the Hindi audience beyond that one iconic role.

# The ""Creepy Guru"" Husband & His Influence

Here's where the ""tea"" gets *really* spicy. Bhumika's husband, **Bharat Thakur**, a self-proclaimed ""spiritual guru"" and yoga instructor, is a major subject of online speculation. The brutal whispers from Reddit paint him as **""creepy,"" ""shady,"" and potentially controlling.** Users question his influence over her career decisions and her subsequent shift away from mainstream Bollywood. There's ""tea"" suggesting he was often seen around her sets, and his unconventional public image contributed to her perceived distance from the typical Bollywood crowd. Some ""tea"" even alleges he ""preyed"" on women seeking spiritual guidance.

# Alleged Cosmetic Procedures: The ""Lost Charm""

While not as heavily trolled as some, there's ""tea"" discussing **Bhumika's alleged plastic surgery.** Users point to changes in her facial features over the years, speculating about subtle (or not-so-subtle) enhancements that, for some, have **""robbed her of her original, innocent charm.""** This is a brutal critique that suggests her attempts to ""fit in"" with Bollywood's beauty standards actually backfired, making her look more ""generic.""

# Losing Big Films & Being ""Difficult""?

Why did she not get bigger roles after *Tere Naam*? Beyond just poor choices, some ""tea"" implies she might have been **""difficult to work with""** or **""had an attitude""** that soured relationships with producers and directors. While not as rampant as with others, the sheer lack of offers after such a massive hit makes people question what truly happened behind the scenes. She reportedly lost out on big films due to her husband's demands or her own perceived lack of professionalism.

# The South Indian Comeback: Too Little, Too Late?

While her Bollywood career fizzled, Bhumika had a more consistent, albeit less high-profile, career in South Indian cinema, particularly in Telugu. However, her more recent ""comebacks"" in Hindi cinema (like *Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan*) are often met with cynicism, perceived as **""sympathy roles""** or attempts to cash in on nostalgia, rather than a genuine resurgence of her star power. She's seen as an actress who never quite reached her full potential due to a combination of alleged missteps and perhaps, a somewhat ""detached"" approach to the cutthroat nature of Bollywood.

**5) BONEY KAPOOR🦄**

# Boney Kapoor: The ""Creepy"" Serial Cheater, Accused Financially Reckless ""Leech,"" and Alleged Beneficiary of a ""Suspicious Death""!

Forget the image of the stoic producer. The **brutal ""tea""** on **Boney Kapoor** paints him as a man driven by lust and financial desperation, leaving a trail of broken homes, immense debt, and even darker whispers about his late wife's death. He's not just a producer; he's a walking controversy.

# The ""Home Wrecker"" & The Brutal Betrayal of Mona

This is where the *ugliest* ""tea"" on Boney truly begins. His affair with **Sridevi** while still married to his first wife, **Mona Shourie Kapoor**, is not just a ""controversy""; it's branded as a **""despicable betrayal""** that traumatized his children, Arjun and Anshula.

* **Public Humiliation of Mona:** The ""tea"" alleges that Boney was **""obsessed"" with Sridevi for years**, even before marrying Mona, and relentlessly pursued her. He then **abandoned his wife and young children** to live with Sridevi, leaving Mona to face public humiliation. Mona herself, in interviews, spoke of the pain of being ""made to feel lesser"" and how her children suffered immensely, with Arjun allegedly becoming overweight due to the trauma.
* **Sridevi as the ""Other Woman"":** The narrative on gossip forums is harsh on Sridevi too, often calling her a **""home wrecker""** who was allegedly **""friends with Mona""** and even **""stayed in their house""** while seducing Boney. The ""tea"" points out the hypocrisy of Boney later trying to mend ties with his abandoned children after Sridevi's death.
* **The ""Illegal Marriage"" Whispers:** Some brutal ""tea"" goes as far as questioning the *legality* of Boney's marriage to Sridevi, implying that if Mona remained his legally wedded wife until her death, his subsequent marriage could be considered ""illegal"" for that duration, making Janhvi and Khushi ""illegitimate"" in the eyes of some.

# The ""Tharki Budha"" (Perverted Old Man) & Public Groping

This is where Boney's public image truly takes a nosedive. The ""tea"" on Reddit frequently refers to him as a **""pathetic,"" ""tharki af"" (perverted as f**\*), and ""gross"" old man\*\* due to his alleged inappropriate behavior with younger women in public.

* **Gigi Hadid Incident:** The infamous video of him allegedly **""groping"" Gigi Hadid** at the NMACC gala went viral, sparking outrage and cementing his image as a **""creep.""** Despite his attempts to downplay it, the visuals were damning.
* **Other ""Creepy"" Encounters:** This wasn't an isolated incident. ""Tea"" points to other instances, like a video where he allegedly **""tried to hug Keerthy Suresh and she politely ignored him.""** The consistent pattern of ""Boner Kapoor"" getting ""boner everytime he is beside random younger women"" has made him a pariah for many, especially given he is a father of three daughters. ""How does he have the guts to be such a creep when he knows he got all eyes (cameras) on him?"" users demand.

# Financial Recklessness & The ""Sridevi Insurance Money"" Conspiracy

Boney Kapoor's alleged **perpetual financial troubles and reckless spending** are a constant topic of ""tea.""

* **Massive Debts:** He's notorious for having been **""broke as f**\*"" multiple times,\*\* accumulating **""huge debts,""** especially after films like *Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja* tanked. The ""tea"" suggests he's fundamentally ""not good with money"" and ""reckless"" with finances.
* **Sridevi's ""Insurance Money"" Controversy:** The **most brutal and widely circulated ""tea""** following Sridevi's tragic death involves rampant speculation about **her life insurance policies.** Whispers on Reddit allege there was a massive **""insurance policy in Dubai where you get more returns (in multiple crores) but the condition is you should die in Dubai,""** and ""ironically Sri Devi died in Dubai and her family got more than the expected money because of that condition."" The ""tea"" goes so far as to suggest that **""Someone need to investigate him for Sridevi's ""accidental"" drowning as well and how many millions he got in insurance money.""** It's a dark, unproven, but persistent theory that fuels extreme suspicion about him.
* **Relying on Daughters' Income:** The brutal reality, according to ""tea,"" is that Boney has been **financially dependent on his daughters.** Janhvi, in particular, is often seen as the **""woman of the house""** who has been **""paying his debts from her income""** and even allegedly contributed significantly to buying their current home. The ""tea"" suggests he's pushing his daughters into the industry because he **""needs the money""** from their careers.

# Nepotism's Ultimate Hypocrite & The ""Deadbeat Dad"" Accusations

Boney Kapoor is seen as the embodiment of **toxic nepotism** who allegedly used his clout to launch his relatively untalented children, while being a **""deadbeat dad""** to his older two.

* **Pushing Flops:** Despite Arjun, Janhvi, and Khushi's often criticized acting skills, Boney reportedly **""pushes"" and ""funds"" their careers relentlessly.** The ""tea"" suggests he's ""making money"" off the goodwill of Sridevi to propel Janhvi, and even gets Arjun work down south after repeated Bollywood failures.
* **""Abandoned"" Arjun & Anshula:** The ""tea"" paints him as having **""abandoned"" Arjun and Anshula** emotionally and financially for much of their lives, especially during their mother's illness and passing. Arjun himself admitted to a ""slightly traumatic"" childhood and little relationship with his father. The ""tea"" is savage: ""why bear children when you don't want to take their responsibilities?"" and ""He is so dead beat to arjun and Anshula.""

**6) BABITA KAPOOR🦄**

Babita Kapoor: The ""Martyr Mother"" Who Allegedly Pushed Her Daughters Into Child Labour for Money & Wrecked Their Personal Lives!

Forget the hagiography of a woman who ""bravely"" left the Kapoor mansion. The **brutal ""tea""** on **Babita Kapoor** paints her as a calculating stage-mom who **ruthlessly exploited her daughters** to survive, meddled disastrously in their personal lives, and maintained cold wars with family members for decades.

# The ""Child Labour"" Mastermind & Financial Desperation

The most savage ""tea"" on Babita is that she allegedly **pushed Karisma into the film industry at a shockingly young age (around 16)** not just out of ambition, but out of **""financial desperation.""** Randhir Kapoor was a known **""alcoholic with a failed career""** who allegedly provided no financial support. The brutal truth, according to gossip forums, is that Babita ""literally lived on Karisma's hardwork & used that poor girl to run her household.""

* **""Used as an Escort""?**: The darkest whispers go as far as to suggest that Karisma was allegedly **""used as an escort by her mother""** to get ahead in the cutthroat industry. While this is a highly controversial and unverified claim, it shows the extreme level of ""tea"" surrounding Babita's alleged methods for her daughters' success.
* **""Shoved Her in Crass Low-Grade Films"":** Forget ""bold choices."" The ""tea"" is that Babita **""didn't allow her to sign films of good makers like YRF & Dharma as they pay less.""** Instead, she **""shoved her in crass low-grade commercial films where she had flowerpot roles,""** simply because they paid more. This brutally exposes her alleged priority for money over artistic integrity or Karisma's genuine talent.
* **Forced Breadwinner:** Karisma was reportedly the **""breadwinner for her family of three""** from a young age and even **""dropped out of school to start earning money.""** This paints a picture of a mother who exploited her child's youth and talent for survival, a far cry from a supportive parent. ""Karisma cried herself to sleep every night,"" allegedly watching her younger sister, Kareena, spared from the same ordeal.

# The ""Controlling Monster"" Who Wrecked Karisma's Love Life

Babita's alleged interference in Karisma's personal life is a constant source of brutal ""tea.""

* **Abhishek Bachchan Breakup:** The most famous ""tea"" is that Babita allegedly **demanded that Abhishek Bachchan transfer a significant amount of property/money (even 5 crores in 2002-03) into Karisma's name** before marriage, humiliating the Bachchans and leading to the engagement's brutal collapse. This portrays Babita as a **""greedy"" and ""money-minded"" mother** who prioritized wealth over her daughter's happiness.
* **Meddling in Other Relationships:** ""Tea"" suggests Babita's controlling nature extended beyond just Abhishek, with whispers that she **""forced"" Karisma into other relationships for financial stability,** leading to her disastrous marriage to Sanjay Kapur. Some even claim she was behind Karisma's **""alimony demands""** during her divorce, ensuring her daughter got a hefty payout.

# The ""Bitter Matriarch"" & Decades-Long Family Feuds

Babita's strained relationships with the rest of the Kapoor clan are a known, and often brutally discussed, aspect of her life.

* **The ""Exiled"" Status:** When she left Randhir due to his alleged alcoholism and lack of financial support, the ""tea"" reveals she and her daughters were largely **""disowned"" and ""ignored"" by the ultra-conservative Kapoor family.** This wasn't just a separation; it was an alleged **exile** where they received ""no financial support"" and faced ""hindrances"" from the family when looking for work.
* **Cold War with Neetu Kapoor:** The ""tea"" is savage about her **""decade-long cold war"" with Neetu Kapoor.** The feud was so deep that **Neetu didn't attend Karisma's wedding, and Babita and her daughters boycotted Riddhima's wedding and even Neetu's mother's funeral.** This shows a level of deep-seated bitterness and pettiness that went on for years, only ""resolving"" when Kareena married Saif Ali Khan, suggesting a calculated PR move to ""mend"" the family image.
* **Feud with Sadhana:** There's also ""tea"" about a **bitter ""family feud"" with her cousin, legendary actress Sadhana**, allegedly over ""business and money,"" to the point where Babita and her daughters **""didn't even attend Sadhana's funeral""** in 2015. This paints a picture of a woman whose grudges ran deep, even to the grave.

# The ""Snobbish"" & ""Controlling"" Persona

Beyond the major feuds, general ""tea"" portrays Babita as **""snobbish"" and ""controlling,""** especially over Karisma. She allegedly micromanaged Karisma's career, accompanying her to shoots and even dictating her interactions, contributing to Karisma being perceived as ""not interacting with anyone"" and being ""cold.""

**7) BHAGYASHREE🦄**

You want brutal, spicy ""tea"" on **Bhagyashree**? Alright, let's pull back the curtain on the ""innocent beauty"" image and expose the real, unvarnished gossip that festered after her explosive debut. This isn't just about a career cut short; it's about alleged marital strangeness, baffling choices, and a squandered opportunity.

# Bhagyashree: The ""One-Film Wonder"" Whose Career Was Butchered by a Controlling Husband & Her Own Delusions!

Forget the fairytale romance of *Maine Pyaar Kiya*. The **brutal ""tea""** on **Bhagyashree** paints a picture of a starlet who became an industry pariah due to her incredibly bizarre demands, a **controlling and allegedly shady husband**, and a fundamental inability to grasp how Bollywood actually works. She wasn't just unlucky; she allegedly **self-destructed** a golden career.

# The ""One-Hit Blunder"" & Her Immediate Obsession

She burst onto the scene with *Maine Pyaar Kiya*, a blockbuster that made her an overnight sensation. The *brutal* truth, according to gossip forums, is that she then **immediately butchered her own career** with one insane demand: **she would** ***only*** **act in films where her husband, Himalaya Dassani, was the lead hero.** This wasn't a cute, romantic gesture; it was a **""career suicide pact""** that shocked and infuriated the industry.

* **""Forced Producers to Cast Her Husband"":** ""Tea"" is rampant about her allegedly **""forcing producers to cast her husband.""** The industry swiftly labeled this as **""unprofessional"" and ""delusional,""** as Himalaya was universally considered a **""bakwas actor""** with no talent or screen presence.
* **""Flopped Hard Because Nobody Wanted to See Her Husband"":** Her subsequent films, where she inexplicably insisted on this ""husband clause"" (e.g., *Qaid Main Hai Bulbul*, *Tyagi*, *Paayal*), were **spectacular, agonizing flops.** The ""tea"" is that audiences simply **""didn't want to see her husband on screen,""** and she sank her own ship by clinging to him. She went from being the face of a hit to Bollywood's biggest cautionary tale within *months*.

# The ""Controlling Husband"" & His Shady Dealings

Himalaya Dassani is a central figure in Bhagyashree's career implosion, and the ""tea"" on him is equally brutal.

* **""Patriarchy Destroys Women"":** Reddit's discussions often brand Bhagyashree as the **""poster child of how patriarchy destroys women and their opportunities,""** directly pointing to Himalaya's alleged control. She supposedly married into a **""conservative Marwari household""** where she was ""forced to give up her career"" and ""completely mold herself"" to her in-laws' demands. She allegedly couldn't even eat non-veg food at home and had to go out for it.
* **""Arrested for Gambling"":** The ""tea"" highlights Himalaya's own shady past, including being **""arrested in connection with a gambling racket""** in Mumbai. This added to his already dubious reputation and cast a further shadow over Bhagyashree's questionable choices.
* **""Open Marriage"" & Hotel Room Drama:** This is the *spiciest* and most shocking ""tea."" A widely circulated anonymous anecdote from a hotel worker in Dubai claims that Bhagyashree was once seen **returning to her room with a ""young Arab guy,""** only for Himalaya to later return, enter the room, and then allegedly **""came back outside after a few seconds. Completely unbothered.""** The Arab guy allegedly told the receptionist that Himalaya ""just said 'I'm sorry' and left the room when he caught them in a compromising position."" This wild story fuels theories that they have an **""open marriage""** where ""they're both free to hook up and sleep with other people,"" and ""emotional fidelity is what matters to them."" It paints a picture of a far more unconventional and morally grey relationship than her public image suggests.

# The ""Royal"" Background That Didn't Save Her

Despite coming from an **erstwhile royal family (Sangli),** the ""tea"" is that this privilege did absolutely nothing to save her career once her bizarre demands set in. In fact, her family reportedly **""didn't approve of this marriage""** to Himalaya, suggesting even they saw the impending disaster. Her royal background was just a footnote to her epic career collapse.

# The ""Pathetic Comeback"" Attempts & Lost Identity

Her subsequent attempts at a ""comeback"" are often met with cynicism. She's seen as an actress who **""refused to age""** but also refused to evolve beyond the *Maine Pyaar Kiya* image she then ironically tried to shed. Her latest cameos are often seen as ""sympathy roles"" or attempts to stay relevant, but for many, her moment passed decades ago when she prioritized a deeply unpopular condition over a burgeoning career. She's viewed as someone whose **identity was ""completely taken away""** by her marriage and conservative household, becoming ""Bhagyashree who was married to Himalaya"" instead of ""Bhagyashree, the star.""

I'm just the bloke next door with grown up kids and a wife, on the surface we seem fine just like everyone else, but underneath things are not so great. 
The thing is though, we seem to have fallen into taking each other for granted, feeling too comfortable, lack of effort has now pushed way to feeling a little invisible, plus we have older kids who will probably fly the nest within a few years, and so im unsure how we'll navigate just being a couple.  
*I'm not here to moan, or vent, promise!*

I go to work, i go through all the formalities talking with work colleagues who i have no real intention of becoming friends with, i have lunch on my own because i really cant stand how some people moan about the same thing day after day. I go home then normally i will prep and cook dinner, i cook 90% of the time, and i enjoy it, i find it therapeutic, i might then sort the washing out if there's a load in the machine, tidy up a little, shower then relax in front of the TV.    
*Wow, how boring does that sound?!*

Some things that i like..  
*Lazy mornings, people watching, the warm sun on my skin, fresh coffee, the smell of freshly cut grass, rum (spiced or dark), teasing, exploring castles and forests (not hiking), long drives in the countryside, 90's alternative music, cooking and trying new foods, horror/psychological films, late nights and early lazy mornings, drawing/sketching, dogs.*

A few things i dont like..  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

I see myself as a gentleman, im polite and courteous, i say strange words like ""please"" and ""thank you"", but don't let that put you off!  
My friends would probably say that im quiet until i get to know someone, but really im just quietly confident. I'm easy to get on with and down to earth, somewhat flirtatious but always respectful.",1,1753876293.0,Over40sClub,0,1.0,False

Yaad hai, jab pehli baar apni chamchamati nayi EV ghar leke aaya tha? Ek alag hi feeling thi. Pollution free, silent drive, aur petrol pump ki line se chhutkara. Lag raha tha life set ho gayi hai. Phir aaya pehla long drive ka plan. Sab set tha – route, snacks, gaane. Bas ek cheez jo set nahi thi, woh the charging spots aur unke apps.



Socha, chalo pehle research kar lete hain. Pata chala har charger company ka apna alag app hai. Ok, theek hai. Download kiye 4-5 apps. Sab mein account banao, KYC karo, alag alag wallet mein paise daalo. Tab laga, yaar, yeh toh phone ki memory kam pad jaayegi, aur wallet toh mera bank balance dekh ke rone lagega!



Ek baar highway pe nikla. Battery thodi low thi, socha challo is wale charging station pe rokte hain. Jaake dekha, charger toh hai, but woh mere download kiye hue apps mein se kisi ke saath compatible hi nahi! Arre baap re! Yeh kya majra hai? Uske liye ek aur naya app download karo, phir se sign-up karo, phir se paise add karo. Utni der mein toh coffee thandi ho gayi aur mein paseene se tar-batar. Bhai, yeh charging hai ya UPSC ka exam? Har bar naya challenge!



Aur toh aur, kabhi kisi app ka server down, kabhi payment fail. Aisa lagta hai jaise charging station pe khade hokar lottery ka ticket khareed rahe ho – pata nahi kaam banega ya nahi. Iss sab mein na, woh jo range anxiety hoti hai na, woh toh second number pe chali jaati hai. Pehle toh app anxiety ho jaati hai! ""Yaar, iss charger ki app chalegi bhi ya nahi?""



Kaash, koi aisa solution ho. Matlab, soch ke dekho, agar bas \*ek hi app\* ho. Jaise UPI hai na? Sab jagah chalta hai. Waise hi, \*ek app, aur ek hi wallet\* se saare chargers chal jaayen. Kisi bhi brand ka charger ho, koi tension nahi. Plug in karo, scan karo, aur \*kaam ban gaya\*. Socho kitni shanti mil jayegi!



Agar aisa ho gaya na, toh woh jo range anxiety hai na, woh toh waise hi khatam ho jayegi. Kyunki pata hoga ki India mein kahin bhi jao, koi bhi charger mile, apni woh \*ek app kaam karegi\*. Na phone mein 10 apps ka jhanjhat, na alag alag wallet mein paise daalne ka tension. Bas ek click, aur gaadi charge.



Sahi bataun, agar yeh charging apps ka chakkar solve ho jaye na, toh EV ka experience next level ho jayega. Lagta hai jaise kisi ne meri dil ki baat sun li ho. Aise system ki toh sach mein zaroorat hai, bhai!",1,1753876061.0,2ChargeEV,0,1.0,False

He has pled guilty or no contest to, or had charges dropped for, multiple DUIs and several different versions of domestic abuse. He also pled guilty in a hit and run incident, including lying to police and driving without a license.

I spent the whole night staring at my window.

Nothing else happened. No more tapping. No shadows. No faces.

But when the sun came up, I went outside to check.

There were footprints.

Bare.

Both sets about the size of mine, maybe smaller.

They started directly beneath my bedroom window and trailed off toward the tree line—except there were no return prints. Just a single path leading away.

Like whoever—or whatever—was out there didn’t come to the house.

They came from it.

⸻

I didn’t call the cops. I don’t know why. Maybe because in Hallow Creek, the cops don’t really show up unless you’re bleeding. And even then, it depends on where you’re bleeding.

Instead, I called Cassie.

She picked up after the first ring.

“You saw them,” she said. Not a question.

“Someone was at my window,” I told her.

Pause. “Don’t look at them. Whatever you do, just… don’t engage.”

“You said that before,” I said. “You and Sam. ‘Don’t look too long.’ What does that mean?”

She sighed. “It’s not what you think. It’s not ghosts or whatever. You think we’d all still live here if it was that easy?”

“Then what is it?”

“I don’t know,” she said. “But it gets worse if you talk about it too much.”

I could tell she wanted to say more.

So I pushed.

“I found photos in my dad’s desk. Surveillance. People watching the house. He was in some of them. Watching his own home. What the hell does that mean?”

Silence.

Then: “You need to talk to Eva.”

⸻

Eva was quiet when I showed up at her place, a small rented unit over the old feed store. She let me in without saying much.

Her apartment smelled like burnt coffee and dust.

There were no mirrors.

Not one.

“Cassie said I should talk to you,” I said.

She just nodded and motioned for me to sit.

“You want the story?” she asked. “The real one?”

“I want to know what’s happening.”

She poured a drink—whiskey in a chipped mug—and sat across from me.

“My little brother used to talk about the Echo Path,” she said. “Said it was a game. Said he heard kids at school talk about it, but when I asked their parents, they denied it even existed.”

“What was it?”

“A trail behind the school. Somewhere near the creek. He said if you walked it at sunset, you could hear things. Voices that sounded like your own. But not saying anything you remembered saying.”

I felt cold.

“My dad went looking for it,” she continued. “Took Jacob out there one day. Said he’d prove it was nothing. Said people were just telling stories to scare kids.”

Her hand tightened around the mug.

“Two days later, our basement flooded. We found the dog dead. And my dad started walking the hallways at night. Just… pacing. Always muttering the same thing: ‘Don’t stare. Don’t speak. Don’t remember.’ Over and over.”

“What happened to him?”

“He hanged himself,” she said. “In the school gymnasium.”

I sat in silence.

“He left a note,” she added. “Said he’d seen too much of himself in the woods. And that whatever you see in the reflection isn’t always you.”

⸻

Later that night, I drove out to the school.

The trail was still there.

Faint, overgrown, but visible if you knew what to look for.

I followed it.

It led behind the playground, past an old maintenance shed, and down toward the creek.

About a mile in, I found the clearing.

No signage. Just a ring of stones at the center and several broken branches hanging low, like they’d been bent by something heavy.

It was quiet. Too quiet.

Even the frogs had gone still.

I stood there for a long time.

And then I heard it.

Leaves crunching. From two different directions.

I turned, light flashing between the trees.

Nobody there.

But the crunching didn’t stop.

Like someone was circling just out of view.

And then—

A whisper.

Just one word:

“Ethan.”

I ran.

⸻

When I got home, my front door was ajar.

Nothing was missing.

But my dad’s photo album was open on the table.

Every picture with his face in it had been scratched out.

And one was missing entirely.

The one with all three of us—me, Mom, and Dad—on the porch the year before she left.

In its place was a folded piece of paper.

On it, in shaky handwriting:

“If you remember too much, they’ll remember you.”

⸻

I know this all sounds insane. Like I’ve lost it.

But I think I’m starting to piece it together.

The Echo Path isn’t just a place. It’s a ritual. A kind of door.

Kids used to walk it as a dare.

Most probably forgot.

But some remembered.

Too much.

My dad. Eva’s brother. Maybe even the whole damn town.

Something about Hallow Creek makes people forget.

Or maybe it doesn’t.

Maybe it just buries the memories so deep they rot.

And maybe—when something rots for long enough—it comes back wrong

1md48i4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1md48i4,Corrosion and Discolouration Assessment [Breville Duo Boiler]”,"Hi all,
Looking for some advice. I’ve had my Breville Dual Boiler (BES920) for several years now, and today I opened it up for a quick internal inspection to check for any leaks or deteriorated O-rings.

While everything looked mostly good, I noticed one of the silicone tubes (circled in red in the photo) was slightly degraded — sticky to the touch and appears to be melting onto what I believe is the steam boiler.

Can anyone confirm what this particular tube is for? And does the required size/length vary by model year? I assume I can just replace it with food-grade high-temp silicone from a coffee parts supplier — any preferred vendors or recommendations would be appreciated.

Also, any tips to prevent this from happening again? From what I can tell, the tube may have softened over time and sagged onto the hot boiler, or perhaps it was routed that way from the factory.

Lastly, I didn’t get around to replacing the O-rings yet — it’s been over 3 years with the originals and there are no leaks so far, but I plan to replace them all as a preventative step soon.

Thanks in advance for any advice!

1md48gt,https://i.redd.it/zdu04fl000gf1.png,My AI tool fixed my dating profile and nearly doubled my matches. Try it out,"Posted about my dating profile tool [https://www.profilemeai.com/](https://www.profilemeai.com/) yesterday and got some solid feedback from some of you who used it. It’s something I built to help myself by generating dating app photos and bios that don’t look fake. My camera roll’s a mess of screenshots and blurry pics, so I made this to fix my own profiles and figured others might find it useful.

What it does:

* Gives you 5 swipe-ready photos: clear face shot, full-body, one showing you do stuff, and two extras for vibe.
* Creates 3 bios and 3 Hinge prompt answers that sound human (based on what works on Bumble and Hinge).
* Includes 3 free “type what you want” photos, like a studio shot in a jacket or a selfie at sunset.
* Extra photos are cheap, less than a coffee.

Why it’s not weird:

* Asks about your hobbies and weekend habits, then tailors photos to that (gym, hiking, coffee runs, etc.).
* Keeps filters low so your freckles and skin look real.
* I tested it on my profiles and saw more likes, no bans or issues.

After yesterday’s post, some users said the free image generation after profile creation wasn’t easy to find, so I tweaked the site to make it clearer. Also added more interest options (like baking, cooking, fishing etc) based on feedback to make photos and bios feel more personal. Also fixed some issues with the dob entry people were facing

I sank too much into testing, training and tweaking the model to get this right, but the photos look legit now, so you don’t have to deal with that. Since some of you were asking yesterday it’s not available in India yet, but I’ll add it if there’s demand so do shoot me a text. Message me if something breaks or you have suggestions.

I’m a 3rd year PhD student looking for a flatmate in my 2bed 2 bath apartment in Smithfield, Dublin 7. 

Open to Grads, PhDs or Working professionals. You get a pretty big room and your own bathroom with a tub (non-en-suite). Move in date by mid August. 

The flat is in *Smithfield Market square*, so it’s bang in the middle of the city. A bus to UCD (where I go) is 5 minutes walk, and there’s plenty of cafés and pubs around. Lighthouse cinema is 2 minutes walk. There’s a Fresh supermarket , Tesco, Lidl all 1-5 minutes away for your groceries. Temple Bar, Camden Street, Phoenix Park, Stonybatter are all pretty close by.

I have these annoying stains on my teeth that have gotten worse over time. I smoke and drink a lot of coffee. When I go to the dentist, he removes them using baking soda, but they always come back after a while.

I’d like to ask if there’s any home remedy or method I could include in my daily dental hygiene routine—something that could either prevent the stains from reappearing or help me remove them safely when they show up and that actually works.

Any advice is welcome because there are so many products out there and I feel totally lost. Sometimes I even consider some kind of cosmetic cover that isn’t permanent veneers (just aesthetic ones), other times I look at different whitening products.

I’d prefer something that doesn’t damage my teeth over the years. For example, I saw some rough brushes on Amazon that scrape the stains off, but I assume they aren’t good for long-term use.

When I go to the dentist, the stains come back within a week. Going that often is not possible for me—both for financial reasons and because I can’t live at the dentist’s office.

I’m really desperate. Please help me.

1md3xw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_IllustriousCitron525/comments/1md3xw1/pine_needles_coffee_mug_sustainable_innovation/,Pine Needles Coffee Mug — Sustainable Innovation for the Modern Consumer,"# Introduction: Why Sustainability Matters in Everyday Products

The sustainability revolution isn’t coming — it’s here. With climate anxiety and consumer awareness at an all-time high, brands are under pressure to deliver eco-friendly alternatives without sacrificing design or function. One unlikely hero emerging in this space? The Pine Needles Coffee Mug — a zero-waste, biodegradable innovation turning forest litter into functional beauty.

This blog takes a deep dive into how these mugs are made, why they matter, and how businesses and consumers can benefit from embracing pine needle-based alternatives.

#  What Is a Pine Needles Coffee Mug?

A Pine Needles Coffee Mug is a type of biodegradable drinkware made by blending fallen pine needles with resin or biopolymers. These needles are collected from forest floors — typically where they're a wildfire hazard — and converted into molded products like cups and utensils.

# Materials and Process

* Raw Material: Fallen pine needles (Pinus roxburghii or similar species)
* Binder: Polylactic acid (PLA), biopolymer, or organic resin
* Process: Cleaned → Dried → Pulverized → Mixed → Molded → Finished

The result? A rustic yet refined mug that’s durable, heat-resistant, and completely compostable at the end of its life.

# The Case for Pine Needles: Data-Driven Sustainability

According to a 2021 report by the UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme), over 8 million tons of plastic waste enter the oceans annually. Traditional ceramic and plastic mugs, while reusable, have a high carbon footprint due to energy-intensive manufacturing or non-biodegradable materials.

# Key Environmental Benefits:

|Feature|Pine Needles Mug|Plastic Mug|Ceramic Mug|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Biodegradable|✅|❌|❌|
|Energy-efficient|✅|❌|❌|
|Recycled content|✅ (natural waste)|Rare|No|
|Compostable|✅|❌|❌|

A pine needle-based mug not only diverts forest biomass waste but also reduces dependency on fossil fuels and harmful polymers.

# Design & Utility — Not Just an Eco-Gimmick

Too often, sustainability compromises design. Not here. Pine Needles Coffee Mugs are:

* Microwave Safe
* Dishwasher Friendly
* Lightweight but Durable
* Naturally Textured and Aesthetic

# Use Cases:

* Daily coffee or tea mugs at home and offices
* Restaurant/café serving ware
* Sustainable corporate gifting
* Camping and travel gear

These mugs appeal to both function-focused users and design-savvy consumers.

#  Industry Use Case — How Himalayan Pine Company Innovates at Scale

One notable manufacturer, Himalayan Pine Company, uses a patented process to mold pine needles into various lifestyle products. Based in Himachal Pradesh, India, the company collaborates with local communities to collect pine biomass, empowering women and reducing forest fire risks.

# Their Coffee Mug Line Features:

* Elegant matte finish
* Custom logo engraving (B2B gifting)
* Bulk packaging with zero plastic
* Lifecycle tracking via QR-enabled tags

# Challenges & Solutions in Scaling Pine Needle Products

Despite its promise, pine needle drinkware faces several hurdles:

# Challenges

1. Supply Chain Volatility – Seasonal needle collection
2. Durability Concerns – Perception of “biodegradable” as fragile
3. Lack of Consumer Awareness
4. Resin Sourcing & Costs

# Solutions

* Use of hybrid biopolymer blends for longer durability
* Awareness campaigns around sustainable lifestyle products
* Government support (such as India’s Startup India scheme)
* Collaborations with forest departments for steady needle supply

#  How to Market Pine Needle Mugs as a Brand

If you're a sustainable D2C brand or eco-retailer, here’s a framework for marketing Pine Needle Coffee Mugs:

# A.C.E. Framework:

1. A – Aesthetic Storytelling
   * Use visuals showing forest-to-cup journey
   * Focus on earthy textures and minimalism
2. C – Community Involvement
   * Highlight artisans or rural workers involved
   * Showcase ethical sourcing and fair pay
3. E – Environmental Metrics
   * Quantify carbon saved per mug
   * Display composting or end-of-life options

# Example Pitch:

""This mug saved 250g of CO2 emissions and helped prevent a forest fire in Himachal — all before your first sip.""

# FAQs: Pine Needles Coffee Mugs

# Q1: Are pine needle mugs safe for hot liquids?

Yes, most are designed to withstand up to 120°C, suitable for hot beverages.

# Q2: How long do they last?

With proper care, they last 2–4 years. They naturally degrade faster in composting conditions after disposal.

# Q3: Can you microwave or dishwasher them?

Yes, if made with reinforced bio-resin, they’re microwave and dishwasher safe. Always check product labeling.

# Where to Buy Pine Needle Coffee Mugs

Here are a few trustworthy sources:

* [Himalayan Pine Company](https://himalayanpine.co) — Direct from manufacturer
* Amazon India — Under ""Eco-friendly drinkware""
* Sustainable product expos or B2B marketplaces like TradeIndia or ExportersIndia

Retailers can also request custom designs, corporate gifting packs, or white-labeled units.

#  Conclusion: The Future of Drinkware Is in the Forest

The Pine Needles Coffee Mug isn't just a product — it's a philosophy. It proves that sustainability, when executed with intelligence and design thinking, can compete with and even outperform traditional materials.

As consumers demand transparency and brands look for purpose-driven innovation, pine needle-based products are poised to define the next chapter of eco-conscious commerce.",1,1753874509.0,u_IllustriousCitron525,0,1.0,False
1md3xpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/dysautonomia/comments/1md3xpl/i_think_i_definitely_have_dysautonomia_or_pots/,I think I definitely have dysautonomia or pots,"I just want to start by saying the last few years have been pretty crazy for me. I had my fourth moderna covid booster jab in 2022 and about a month after that it was like the histamines in my body started to go crazy. I thought it was the salt that was being used at my parents house to soften the water, I would itch all over before a shower, I would itch all over even crazier after a shower. I would get a very hot feeling face, god forbid I even thought about touching or grazing one of my ears and the heat would spread. I wouldn't get welts, but visible red spots and the only thing that would calm it down was taking an antihistimine combined with the famotidine I take everyday for reflux. If I didn't take it, I would be miserable all day and night, and feel like I was getting bit by bugs etc. I was sitting in the car one day after going to olive garden with my sister, and a part of my arm just started to get visibly red and splotchy, we thought maybe it was the shrimp I ate, but this has not happened consistently when I eat seafood. I had IGE blood testing for allergies, I thought maybe it was the timothy hay I feed my bunny, but no. Even when I'm not around the hay etc.. these type of reactions can still occur at random. I definately can't go anywhere near gain detergent. For the most part these reactions have quieted down now.

I noticed another problem began about 6 months after this though. My resting heart rate is sitting anywhere from about 85 upto 115 even while sitting. It is definately worse when I get out of bed in the morning ( I do smoke), but the moment I get up sometimes before even having my smoke, my heart rate is already surging (blood pressure has also been elevated since around this timeframe as well), sometimes it gets me all light headed for a few minutes, in conjunction with my first few sips of coffee, cold weather really seems to affect this worse. I will get these weird head rushes when it happens. I can't even talk to anyone in the morning as I feel so groggy, and when I try when I'm trying to wake up, my heart rate and bp goes a little nuttier and I start to get even more light headed.

My blood pressure is anywhere from 125 upto 158 during moments of ""fight or flight"" when that likes to randomly kick in, or something stresses me out even a little, even just raising my voice talking back and forth as my family likes to yell across from room to room (lol) to communicate. It's been recorded at 135/94 at the doctor's office, so I noticed my diastolic has been going upwards as well. I can't seem to tolerate any type of heat, I will get what feels like heat flushes that begin at my cheek and kind of go up my face, when that happens, my body can instantly go into the fight or flight. Trying to explain to doctors this is not the result of some anxiety is a nightmare. Yes my family has a long history of anxiety, but this is my blood pressure and heart rate already elevated, even at rest, and when something triggers it even just a little bit more that's when things can get crazy. It literally feels sometimes like my heart is pounding right out of my chest, not all the time, but even just going to a doctor's appointment, blood work...etc and I have literally never had these problems before. Going into a bus that even feels a little hot? Forget it, I had 5-6 panic attacks I couldn't stop in a row the one day, silently. I was trembling, felt nauseous, and when my heart races and thumps that strongly it even feels like it squeezes uncomfortably at times. I had one cardiologist say they don't know what could be causing my high heart rate/bp. They instantly just wanted me to under go a Cardiac CT angiogram, when I literally just got through a lower abdomen/pelvis ct with contrast as regular monitoring of my pancreas/varices from when I had pancreatitis in 2016.

My spleen is also slightly enlarged now with no clue as to why, and my WBC was raised at 12.5 two months ago and monocytes raised. This all happened after I went through a routine blood draw, (one of many in the space of 2 months) and after I had the CT with contrast, I don't know what happened, the needle went in and the person taking it totally caught me off guard when they all the sudden shoved the needle up even farther into my arm. It didn't feel too good, and my fight or flight kicked in (again silently) I wanted to bolt out of the chair so bad. It seemed it was taking the guy a little too long getting my blood and he seemed distracted, as well as putting the band on my arm too tight. Next thing I knew, I was having the weird fight or flight on the bus (on my way to the cardio appointment) that I had later that same day. Again a blood pressure cuff was put on the same arm, I was measured at 134/94 and EKG tachycardia. All my ekg's have been showing tachycardia even when I don't feel it.

  
I had a tooth extraction last september and something happened at the dentist that has never happened before. They had me kind of lying back in the chair, I felt totally fine and relaxed, even as they started to work on getting the tooth loosened, then all of the sudden, the multiple lidocaine shots I was given started to kick in hard, my heart felt it was pounding as if I just ran 5 miles, and my chest felt it was being squeezed, it was absolutely horrific and terrifying and lasted for atleast 2 minutes. I know the epinepherine in these shots can raise your heart rate a bit, but I've never had this particular thing happen, so needless to say, I'm terrified to go back to the dentist or have any kind of epinepherine now.

3 Days later my arm began to hurt. I noticed a swollen type bump appeared in the middle of that arm. Having had a past history of dvt/pulmonary embolism when I was sick with the pancreatitis, this really scared me and it happened to be the same arm. Needless to say I ended up at the ER twice trying to get it figured out. I really had to push a GP to even get an ultrasound on it, and the ultrasound showed nothing. The pain has mostly resolved but the bump remains in my arm, I'm thinking its caused the skin underneath/muscle to be more inflamed and swollen.

I also found out on my recent CT scan that both of my ovaries appeared to be prominent and enlarged. Possibly due to PCOS, but it said an ultrasound would be better to visualize if it was clinically necessary. So that's awesome as well and another thing I have to get looked at. I had on and off groin pain a few years prior to this. I wouldn't be surprised if I do have endo as my periods have always been heavy. I also suffer from cyclical yeast infections that won't go away and if the wrong detergent has been used in the wash and its on my underwear, forget it.

My past history, I was diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism they had me on vitamin d2 50,000 units every week for about 10 years. They found some nodules on my thyroid. My last ultrasound showed nothing on my thyroid, but I am starting to wonder if something is going on there.

My parents/doctors they all think it's down to stress and anxiety and I know it can't be that, I've always had a low level of underlying anxiety sure, but what's been going on has been something else entirely. I'm so frustrated and can't even seem to get a doctor who will listen to me, let alone not say "" oh do you think maybe your a little stressed out? yeah... that's probably it. I mean I had an EGD procedure in November to check the varices in my stomach (from past splenic vein clot from pancreatitis) and I looked at my records stating I woke up with tachycardia. Like what is that?

Or something adrenal related... but for some reason, Pots/dysautonomia/MCAS seems to fit my symptoms. Sure all of this is a lot of stress, my recent CT also didn't show my varices which is a mystery, as I had varices on my EGD in November, but I've had two gastro doctor's trying to label me as having Chronic Pancreatitis as well, with no evidence to actually back up their diagnosis. At the same time though, they can't say why my spleen is slightly enlarged.

I go home then normally i will prep and cook dinner, i cook 90% of the time, and i enjoy it, i find it therapeutic, i might then sort the washing out if there's a load in the machine, tidy up a little, shower then relax in front of the TV.    
*Wow, how boring does that sound?!*

Some things that i like..  
*Lazy mornings, people watching, the warm sun on my skin, fresh coffee, the smell of freshly cut grass, rum (spiced or dark), teasing, exploring castles and forests (not hiking), long drives in the countryside, 90's alternative music, cooking and trying new foods, horror/psychological films, late nights and early lazy mornings, drawing/sketching, dogs.*

A few things i dont like..  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

I see myself as a gentleman, im polite and courteous, i say strange words like ""please"" and ""thank you"", but don't let that put you off!  
My friends would probably say that im quiet until i get to know someone, but really im just quietly confident. I'm easy to get on with and down to earth, somewhat flirtatious but always respectful.",0,1753874293.0,FriendsOver50,0,0.5,False

by at lunch time. 

At first, I didn’t really mind if he helped himself to a quick bowl of chili or snacked on some fries passing through.

And he’s been helping himself to a lot of food. I’m talking like eating a full plate when I specifically buy for only our crew. Last week he was checking in on his rental property, came to our house, washed up, made a TO GO plate, and then just left. At least make it seem like you came to chat us up and didn’t just come for a free meal. 

How would you address this? He actually got upset one week when we ordered take out and he said “what, you guys don’t cook together anymore?” Like, I didn’t even work with this guy. From what I’ve heard from guys who have worked for him, he’s loaded and cheap. I don’t want to tell him he can’t come by, should I ask
him to call the house in the morning if he’s coming down so I can buy enough food? This is crazy. He should at least be throwing in some $ right.

I do not drink espresso every day so I guess best option is to single dose. 

I recently got a Mythos 1 as part of a deal, and I have been reading on single dosing, retention etc. 

Per design, the retention is “low”, but still too high (would need flushing 6-8 grams through each time, which I want to avoid). 

Am I correct that 1) removing clump crusher 2) humidifying beans before grind to avoid static 3) using some sort of air bellow to push beans and ground coffee down and out, would make this a suitable single dose grinder?
I read that this could get retention close to zero. 

Unless going Monolith (no, to expensive) this seem like a pretty solid option (and the grinder I got “for free”), would you agree?

There is an off-the-shelf single dose hopper available (see pic).

""Didn’t Sarah say something like, that they already have all the power one could have—and now they only strive for wisdom and love? Maybe she was trying to tell us something.""

Helmini gave him a piercing look.

""That we’re searching for the meaning of life in the wrong places?""

""There have been stories about the Progenitors ever since the Odrell went into space—and even long before that. They might be ancient. If anyone knows something about the meaning of life, it’s probably them.""

Helmini leaned her head back, deep in thought.

""It’s easy to talk about love and wisdom - but only when you don’t have to fear a knife. Maybe they’re right. But do they even understand what it’s like to fight for your own survival? What it’s like to fear execution or disrespect and demotion? Do they even remember what it means to be mortal?""

""You don’t think we should show more love?""

""I do - but only in the right context.""

""In a marriage? Or rather - life partnership?""

Helmini didn’t answer. She stared pensively at her bowl of food and took a bite.

""This isn’t bad. Did you cook it?""

""No - and you should be thankful for that.""

Helmini chuckled softly and took a sip of water.

They ate in silence.

""So… will the great Helmini now reveal to me why our marriage could save her life?""

Helmini, who had just finished eating, looked at him. A playful smile danced on her lips, and she bared her teeth teasingly.

„That’s something the Federation’s Prime Minister will have to wrest from me by force.“

""There she is again… the *true* Golani."" Sola sighed dramatically. ""So how am I supposed to do that?"" he said looking in her eyes

Helmini reacted to his flirtations by standing up and walking over to the large window.  
Well, technically it was a big screen giving the illusion of a window to the outside. Which—due to radiation shielding and armor plating - it most definitely was not.

She glanced over her shoulder while standing in front of the stars and slowly let her dress slip from her shoulders.

""Black lace and green skin. An exquisite combination.""

Sola stood, left his suit jacket behind, and approached Helmini slowly.

Then he embraced her from behind.

Sola felt the warmth of her body, saw the gentle rise and fall of her chest as she breathed, and laid his blue hands into her green ones.

Beneath the stars of space, they pressed against one another.

For a long time, they spoke only through touches and soft kisses.

As his desire grew stronger, he whispered into her ear:

""Would this be the right moment to ask the ship’s AI if we’re genetically compatible?""

""We are compatible. Odrell and Golani share over 90 percent of their genome. Well for children we might need some Progenitor Witchcraft like an ""Genetic Recombination Egg""-Artifact but it should be possible...""

""Good.""

Sola broke the contact and, with a swift motion, threw Helmini onto his bed, then quickly followed.  
Even the brief moment their bodies were apart felt cold and lonely.

""If you can keep me pinned down, I’ll tell you why our wedding would save my life.  
But I doubt you weak fish-people can manage that.""

Helmini challenged him as he knelt over her.

""Just because we Odrell have aquatic blue skin doesn’t make us fish!""

""Pft.""

Then Helmini attacked.  
They wrestled—and even though Sola fought with all his strength, he couldn’t keep her down.

He had more raw muscle mass but he wasn’t a soldier. And Helmini was trained in close combat an knew how to twist his arms and move her body.

In the end, Helmini sat atop him.

""You just can’t help yourself, you power-hungry Golani... Alright, today I’ll let you win, so you can feel powerful.""

Helmini leaned forward and whispered into his ear, her sweaty skin rubbing against his:

""I feel very safe with you. Because if we marry, the High Council can’t execute me for failing the invasion.  
I mean how would it look if they executed the wife of the Prime Minister of our new alliance partner?  
That’d make this alliance a rather short-lived ... *affair*.""

""That’s why you’re here? Marrying me is better than dying? You really know how to make a man feel appreciated.""

Helmini sat back up. A certain sternness lay in her gaze.

""Do you think I wouldn’t rather die if the thought of being here with you tonight disgusted me?""

""I understand. I will love you and hopefully you’ll be able to do the same.  
Who would’ve thought? Sola and Helmini - the new power couple of this sector.  
My grandfather would probably be cheering… and rolling in his grave at the same time.""

Sola sat up—and they embraced, kissing each other passionately, breathlessly.  
They looked into each other’s eyes for a while, gently caressing one another.

They weren’t the great lovers of a novel or a stage play.

**They were simply Sola and Helmini—both making a logical decision… and, perhaps somewhere in the hidden corners of their hearts, an emotional one too.**

I don't want to be a conspiracy theorist... But this seems very creepy and disturbing. Honestly, I don't truly believe AI is unable to read our messages in private chats.

Secondly, when you go to the search engine, you are offered questions for AI - for example, ""relationship advices"", ""help with feeling stressed"", ""writing a message"", ""parenting advice""... And, at the same time, when you tap the AI button for chatting with it, there is written not to share personal informations 😂. LOL. It's a real paradox, isn't it??!

Today, when people are so alienated from each other, this could be very dangerous. For instance, you ask a friend sth, he isn't texting back, so it's easier to ask AI because it will text you back emediatelly. Some people don't even have anyone to talk with about their personal things, so they will just talk with the robot. 
Also, no one will use their intelligence anymore when you can just ask a robot to think instead of them. Asking AI personal advices is very dangerous, don't forget it... 

Don't let a robot rule your life!!
If you need an advice, ask your friends, family, if you don't have anyone, you have YOURSELF! You are clever enough to rule your own life. If you like a girl, don't ask AI what to do. Talk with her, ask her out. If you are a parent, don't ask AI how to bring up a kid. Sit down, talk with your wife/husband and decide what to do. If you have a problem with a friend, don't ask AI what to do. Call that friend, ask him to drink coffee together and talk about your conflict. 

You're not dumb. But you can become dumb if you stop using your brain cells. 
And go out with friends, not just chatting online, talk with them face to face.

Don't forget - living online harms your health. Phisical and mental health.

I’ve been experimenting with a slightly unconventional inverted method lately and I wanted to share the recipe that’s been giving me consistently tasty results, especially with medium-roast Ethiopian beans.

The big idea here is to start with water, then add the coffee, almost like a reverse bloom. It sounds counterintuitive, but the clarity and sweetness I’m getting from this approach are surprising. It sounds more comfortable mplicated than it is in practice. Here’s the process:

🔧 Setup

Grind: 2:2 on the Knock Aergrind (med-fine)

Dose: 16g coffee

Water: 240g total at 95°C

Method: Inverted

Time: 2:00 steep + 30–40s plunge

Ratio: 1:15


🧪 Method

1. Start inverted.


2. Add 80g of 95°C water to the chamber.


3. Dump in 16g of ground coffee directly into the hot water.


4. Immediately pour in the remaining 160g water, slowly and in concentric circles to evenly saturate.


5. Give one gentle stir in a NSEW pattern.


6. Add filter cap and press out excess air (not hard, just enough to remove the headspace).


7. Flip onto a mug and leave to brew.


8. At the 2:00 mark, plunge slowly over 30–40 seconds.


☕️ Why I Like It

Starting with water softens the initial extraction, so the acidity is smoother.

Stirring only once preserves clarity while still fully saturating the grounds.

Plunging out the air gap before flipping improves consistency and reduces gushing.

The cup opens up over time as it cools — fruit, chocolate, and a syrupy body.

I’d love to hear if anyone else has played with water-first methods like this. Happy brewing!

\* I always reply to my messages and have online friendships that have been going on for years, I always send good morning messages, and I appreciate the people that can also be conversation starters.

\* I am always respectful and never disrespect others or step into their discomfort zones.

\* I like art, games, anime, gym, walks, coding, games, true crime, yapping, cats, science, history, languages, documentaries, psychology, mental health, so I am sure we can cross interests here or there.

What even is the secret? Is it all luck, hustle, connections, or do I just need to manifest harder? Is there a cosmic “earn money” lever I’m supposed to pull that I missed in school?

First off – it seems like we all have different strategies for making it rain (or at least making it drizzle, LOL):

- Get a regular job and climb that ladder, rung by rung. Feels like forever, right?
- Start a side hustle and hope it blows up overnight. Spoiler: It almost never does overnight!? Or at least, not for me.
- Invest in stocks, crypto, NFTs—but unless you’re psychic, that’s just... confusing sometimes.
- Or, just manifest and binge read some stories about rich people at https://goodnovel.org/. Hey, imagination is free! (Or almost free, until you actually try to live like them!)

Seriously, though: sometimes I wonder, is it better to focus on ONE thing and do it amazingly, or should I be doing five things at once and hope one of them is the golden ticket? 

And let’s talk life hacks, because TikTok keeps telling me I’m two reusable water bottles away from becoming a millionaire by 30. Is it that simple? Please tell me if it is, because my reusable bottle is feeling underused.

- Why does nobody ever share *exactly* how they made their fortune?  
- Why does watching Netflix make it look SO EASY?  
- Where is *my* windfall, universe???  

If you google “how to earn money,” you get literally a million different opinions, but no one tells you which one doesn’t make you want to gouge your eyeballs out with boredom! I mean, I love a little online grind as much as the next person, but some of those “get rich quick” guides are just... tragic (but fun to read on https://goodnovel.org/! CEO falls for sassy assistant? Sure, why not?)

But, honestly—money can buy so many amazing experiences. Travel, gifts for friends, those holographic sneakers I saw on Instagram and cannot STOP thinking about… But, it also feels super overwhelming. Am I the only one who thinks the rules keep changing??

So: What’s the secret, Reddit? How do YOU earn your coin? Is working less for more a myth or am I bad at Googling? Let’s hear some real-life stories (or your wildest get-rich schemes), because honestly, reading fantasy at https://goodnovel.org/ is great, but a little realism (or confusion?) is good too.

1md3ex3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raypeat/comments/1md3ex3/dopamine_and_stuttering/,Dopamine and Stuttering.,"Hi,

I'm curious about a Ray Peat perspective on my circumstance. 

I have a chronic stutter, and dopamine foods/drinks such as coffee, and dopamine meds I've used such as bromantane, modafinil, ADHD meds, etc all cause my stuttering to worsen. SOMETIMES on the day that I use them I find moments when my speech can actually be better due to the uplift in mood. The days after my speech goes really really bad. 

Interestingly, at the same time, as I just mentioned: my mood uplifts along with my energy, motivation, etc. to what I feel is ""normal"" or at least desired. I say this because normally I feel a lack  of motivation, sunny disposition, attention, energy, etc. Also, the days after after taking a dopamine enhancer I feel down, like as a come-down feeling. 

Any idea why these dopamine enhancing foods/substances make me feel great in the short-term, but negatively effect my stuttering (and cause a general negative feeling/mentality in the days following)?

Any thoughts are appreciated. Thanks :)

On a side note, i have heard Ray talking in his later life and it sounds to me he developed a stuttering-like pattern in his own speech. It definitely doesn't sound like a typical stutter which is what I have  (that is, a physical block that is pushed through which creates the ""stuttering"" byproduct. Fear, panic, self consciousness, etc are emotions experienced with it ), but it sounds like he has more of a discombobulated activity of his speech mechanics. I'm also hearing Danny Roddy speak with this kind of stutter/discombobulation too. ",2,1753872817.0,raypeat,0,1.0,False

I am 27 and generally very healthy and athletic. My BMI sits at around 22.5. I have never smoked and don’t drink unless it is a special occasion.

For background, high cholesterol is hereditary, yet I wouldn’t say the family members who are on statins now did much to improve their overall health beforehand and were prescribed at a later age (45+). Their levels were all around 7.5 at the time they started them.

Conversely, I am still quite young and very active. I go to the gym and have a job that involves a lot of lifting, and I max out at about 25,000 steps a day. My diet, if anything, is probably less than what I need because I generally stick to one protein/meal shake during the day because food can be too much when I’m running around. Evening meals are usually pretty simple as well, anything from a salmon poke bowl to a basic chilli. I’ve seen that skipping breakfast can be a factor in increased cholesterol, so I’m planning on making myself overnight oats with a low fat quark to try and improve on that habit. Otherwise, I think my main crimes is a lack of vegetable consumption during the day and having a coffee each morning from my home espresso machine with whole milk?

Is there anything I’m missing here? Or need to work on? Or is it inevitable that genetics are hard to get around?

Dubai has emerged as a global leader in cosmetic dentistry.

In this article, we’ll explore why dental veneers are such a popular choice and how to find the [best dental veneers in Dubai ](https://topsmiledentalclinic.com/best-dental-veneers-dubai/)that match your needs, expectations, and budget.

# What Are Dental Veneers?

Dental veneers are **ultra-thin shells**, typically made from porcelain or composite resin, that are bonded to the front surface of your teeth. They instantly enhance the appearance of your smile by correcting issues like:

* Discolored or stained teeth
* Chipped or broken teeth
* Gaps between teeth
* Misaligned or uneven teeth
* Worn-down enamel

With the **best dental veneers in Dubai**, patients can achieve a natural-looking, Hollywood-style smile that’s long-lasting and personalized.

# Why Choose Dubai for Dental Veneers?

Dubai is renowned for offering high-quality medical and dental services. But what really sets the city apart when it comes to veneers?

# 1. World-Class Clinics

Many clinics that provide the **best dental veneers in Dubai** are equipped with state-of-the-art dental technology. This includes 3D smile design tools, digital X-rays, and computer-aided manufacturing for perfect veneer fit and aesthetics.

# 2. Expert Cosmetic Dentists

Dentists in Dubai often have international qualifications and years of hands-on experience in smile makeovers. They understand facial harmony, symmetry, and the art of customizing veneers for a natural result.

# 3. Hygiene and Safety

Clinics offering the **best dental veneers in Dubai** follow strict sterilization and hygiene protocols — often exceeding international standards.

# 4. Multilingual Staff

Whether you speak English, Arabic, Hindi, or another language, you’ll find dental teams who can communicate with you clearly and comfortably.

# Types of Dental Veneers Available in Dubai

When it comes to choosing the[ best dental veneers in Dubai](https://topsmiledentalclinic.com/best-dental-veneers-dubai/), you’ll need to decide between two main types:

# 1. Porcelain Veneers

These are premium-quality veneers known for their durability, stain resistance, and natural tooth-like appearance.

**Pros:**

* Last 10 to 15 years or longer
* Highly resistant to discoloration
* Look exceptionally realistic

**Cons:**

* More expensive
* Requires slight removal of enamel
* Multi-visit procedure

# 2. Composite Veneers

These are made from a resin material and are applied directly to the tooth surface. They are more budget-friendly and quicker to apply.

**Pros:**

* Lower cost
* One-day procedure
* Easy to repair if damaged

**Cons:**

* Less durable (5 to 7 years)
* Prone to staining
* May not be as natural-looking as porcelain

For long-term results and a seamless look, most clinics offering the **best dental veneers in Dubai** recommend porcelain veneers.

# What Does the Veneer Process Involve?

Here’s what you can expect when getting the **best dental veneers in Dubai**:

# Step 1: Consultation

You’ll meet with a cosmetic dentist who examines your teeth, discusses your goals, and helps you decide which type of veneer is right for you.

# Step 2: Digital Smile Design

Many top clinics use 3D imaging to create a digital mock-up of your future smile. This helps you visualize your results before treatment begins.

# Step 3: Tooth Preparation

For porcelain veneers, a small amount of enamel is removed from your teeth. Impressions are then taken and sent to a dental lab.

# Step 4: Temporary Veneers

You may wear temporary veneers for a few days while your permanent ones are being made.

# Step 5: Final Placement

Once ready, your custom veneers are bonded to your teeth. The dentist makes adjustments to ensure perfect alignment and bite.

# Step 6: Smile Reveal

The result? A natural, balanced, and radiant smile that reflects your personality.

# Cost of the Best Dental Veneers in Dubai

The cost of veneers depends on various factors, including the type of material, the dentist’s expertise, and the number of teeth treated.

# Average Prices:

* **Porcelain Veneers**: AED 2,000 to AED 4,000 per tooth
* **Composite Veneers**: AED 800 to AED 1,500 per tooth

While composite veneers are more affordable upfront, porcelain offers better long-term value due to its strength and stain resistance.

When evaluating the **best dental veneers in Dubai**, always consider quality, expertise, and patient satisfaction — not just price.

# How to Maintain Your Veneers

Once you’ve invested in the **best dental veneers in Dubai**, it’s important to take care of them. Here are a few simple tips:

* **Brush twice daily** with a soft-bristle toothbrush

Not sure who needs to hear this. But sending someone 20 reels in a row on Instagram or triple texting a million times after you just connected or had one coffee date is weird and comes off as very desperate and disregulated. 

If you like someone that you don’t know very well, ask them for a date in a relaxed way and wait and see how they respond. If they don’t have time wait for a while (maybe 2-3 weeks) and check again. If it isn’t happening, move on to the next one.

If someone is busy and you are sending a flurry of texts you’re basically showing that you either:

a) don’t have anything going on in your life 

Or 

b) don’t develop feelings for someone in a healthy way

1md30mw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1md30mw/ive_drifted_apart_from_my_wife_and_im_seriously/,"I’ve drifted apart from my wife, and I’m seriously considering divorce after 8 years","Hey folks,

I’m using a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I’ve been with my wife for 9 years now. I met her at a time when she was between careers. She had just completed a master’s degree in her field but decided to leave it behind to find a new career path.

At that time, I received a job offer to move overseas and accepted it. We got married and moved.

During the first 3 and a half years, she took her time to learn the language of the country we were in (with some degree of success), tried to get involved in some NGOs (with limited success), worked at a coffee shop for 2 months, and later tried to start a business (again, with limited success).

We then moved to a different country, hoping it would be easier for us to integrate into the culture and for her to build a career.

In the past 4 years, she got involved with local NGOs again (with some success) and decided to pursue a career. She enrolled in a 3-year paid distance learning course from our home country. She knew that this certificate wouldn’t be accepted in the country we live in, but she decided to do it anyway because she wasn’t comfortable taking local courses in English or the local language. She does some pro-bono work for NGOs, but has had no stable income whatsoever in the past 9 years.

I had been working continuously from the day we moved until last year, when I experienced burnout. I managed to reach an agreement and received a severance package. I really wanted to save that money. I also received some unemployment insurance from the government, but it didn’t cover all our expenses (not even the rent), so we had to start using money from our savings account. I ended up replacing one kind of stress with another.

I was hoping she would step in and find something to cover the remaining costs while I healed and took some time for myself—for the first time in almost 12 years. That didn’t happen. After a few months, I went back to work even though I wasn’t fully healed. She seems to only apply to “dream jobs.” I don’t love my job either, but I do it every day because we need the income.

She is a wonderful human being, truly—but this whole situation has made me distance myself from her. I feel like I have a dependent. I’ve stopped seeing her as a wife or life partner.

We’ve talked about this situation a couple of times, but not much has changed over the years. I’m so tired that I don’t think I have the energy to keep going and trying. We talked about buying an apartment, but to me, it sounded like, *“I am buying an apartment, I will be the one paying for it and taking on all the risks that come with it.”*

1md30c3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1md30c3/should_i_cut_this_friend_off/,Should I cut this friend off?,"I (21F) had a falling out with two of my closest friends. 

This fallout didn’t happen overnight — it started way back in 2022.

Friends Reg and Kath had a massive fight — bad enough that Kath moved out. And that happened because I told Kath what Reg had been saying about her mom behind her back to other people. That truth shattered a lot between them. But in time, they made up.

Meanwhile, Reg and I had our own history. We also fell out — but reconnected about a year later when she messaged me out of the blue. Her ex had just cheated on her, and she didn’t know who else to run to. So I let her back in like nothing ever happened.

Then came Jake. He courted me for a month (I knew him since 2023, we had been talking on and off since), and I said yes. It only lasted three days, but he became someone I trusted. Then one day, Reg met up with Jake behind my back. She said it was just to “talk” over coffee — to clear the air about what happened between me and him. The next day, she set us up to meet so we could get “closure.” I was caught off guard, but I went along. After we got home, I noticed Jake messaged her. When I asked, she denied it. That’s when something in me shifted.

My instincts kicked in. For the next five months, I was drowning in guilt and confusion — wondering if I was just being paranoid or if something truly was off. I wanted to believe she wouldn’t hurt me. But deep down, I knew she was hiding something.

Eventually, I found out that Reg and Jake had been involved (slept with each other). And worse — Reg had told Jake something deeply personal about me. Something I never shared with him myself. She said it was because she didn’t want him thinking I hadn’t moved on. But it wasn’t her story to tell. Still I chose to forgive her and tried to mend our friendship because I thought no “friendship”is worth destroying over a man. 

During that time, I confided in Dan — a mutual friend. I told him everything, including the moment Jake said, “You don’t know Reg well.”(This was weeks after something happened to them and I don’t know yet) That line haunted me. I felt so guilty even thinking badly of her. I lost sleep over it. Dan knew all of this. He listened quietly — and I thought that meant I was safe. But later, I found out that he told Reg what I said. He never warned me. Never admitted it. I just had to put the pieces together myself. And that cut deep.

Eventually, Reg unfriended me — out of nowhere. I later learned from Kath that she did it because another friend told her that I said we “weren’t close.” (But I didn’t. Dan told that “friend” to have context of why i’m quite aloof with Reg’s presence) That was apparently all it took. So I blocked her. I needed to protect what little peace I had left.

Then came the fiesta. Kath invited me to her town, and I stayed for three days. We had fun, talked, spent time together. I opened up to her and told her everything — my side, my hurt, my truth. But afterward, she stopped responding to my messages. She didn’t spread stories, but her silence spoke volumes. It felt like she made a choice — and it wasn’t me.

Now I’m left questioning Dan. He insists on staying “neutral,” but at some point, that neutrality starts to feel like avoidance. Like he’s protecting everyone but me. I’ve started to feel disrespected and uncomfortable — like I’m the one who’s hard to stand beside because I won’t stay quiet anymore.

Throughout all this, I never tried to ruin anyone’s name. I never told people what Reg did. I didn’t shame Kath for ghosting me. I didn’t call Dan out even when I wanted to. I protected everyone — and I lost myself in the process.

This is my side of the story. I’m tired of carrying it alone.

**Apparently, folks in the material science world are totally over the fact that we're able to** [**3D print titanium alloys**](https://newatlas.com/materials/titanium-alloy-highest-strength-3d-printed-metal/?itm_source=newatlas&itm_medium=article-body) **willy-nilly.**

[New titanium alloys revolutionize 3D printing potential](https://newatlas.com/materials/3d-printed-titanium-alloy-additive-manufacturing/)

[A titanium alloy being additively manufacturedImage courtesy of the researchers](https://preview.redd.it/0krlieivhzff1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d12f43db7b7273106aee36a5892c9d783418916)

Because they have exceptional strength-to-weight ratios, corrosion resistance, and biocompatibility, titanium alloys are used to make aircraft frames, jet engine parts, hip and knee replacements, dental implants, ship hulls, and golf clubs.

Ryan Brooke, an additive manufacturing researcher at Australia's RMIT University, believes we can do way better. ""3D printing allows faster, less wasteful and more tailorable production yet we’re still relying on legacy alloys like Ti-6Al-4V that doesn’t allow full capitalization of this potential,"" he says. ""It’s like we’ve created an airplane and are still just driving it around the streets.""

[Titanium alloys are light, strong and corrosion-resistant, which is why they find use in jet enginesLuka Slapnicar on Unsplash](https://preview.redd.it/lpm4mbd2izff1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=949cea74d1e021bdd1f04c78ee3c1153cf72a82e)

Ti-6Al-4V is also known as Titanium alloy 6-4 or grade 5 titanium, and is a combination of aluminum and vanadium. It's strong, rigid, and highly fatigue resistant. However, 3D-printed Ti-6Al-4V has a propensity for columnar grains, which means that parts made from this material can be strong in one direction but weak or inconsistent in others – and therefore may need alloying with other elements to correct this.

To be fair, Brooke is putting his money where his mouth is. He's authored a paper that [appeared in *Nature* this month](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60162-0) on a new approach to finding a reliable way to predict the grain structure of metals made using additive manufacturing, and thereby guide the design of new high-performance alloys we can 3D print.

The researchers' approach, which has been in the works for the last three years, evaluated three key parameters in predicting the grain structure of alloys to determine whether an additive manufacturing recipe would yield a good alloy:

https://reddit.com/link/1md2zkn/video/kgzllxjtkzff1/player

**Non-equilibrium solidification range(ΔTs): the temperature range over which the metal solidifies under non-equilibrium conditions.**

* **Growth restriction factor (Q): the initial rate at which constitutional supercooling develops at the very beginning of solidification.**
* **Constitutional supercooling parameter (P): the overall potential for new grains to nucleate and grow throughout the solidification process, rather than just at the very beginning.**

Through this work, the team experimentally verified that P is the most reliable parameter for guiding the selection of alloying elements in 3D-printed alloys to achieve desired grain structures for strength and durability.

[Study lead author Ryan Brooke inspects a sample of the new titanium alloy that's 30&#37; cheaper to produce than standard titaniumImage courtesy of the researchers](https://preview.redd.it/5o7jb1waizff1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd7e9982559334905d91f727ce5889db9d873674)

This method, which uses a wealth of experimental data and computational tools, is said to save on time and costs in developing additively manufactured alloys by reducing the number of iterations and speeding up development cycles.

The team didn't describe its own titanium alloy in the paper as it plans to commercialize it soon – but claims it's 29% cheaper to produce than regular titanium. The researchers also noted that they ""have been able to not only produce titanium alloys with a uniform grain structure, but with reduced costs, while also making it stronger and more ductile.""

That could make titanium alloy more accessible for the aforementioned applications across industries ranging from aerospace to healthcare, and potentially lower the costs of manufacturing and maintaining high-performance components.

# JULY 29th, 2025~Rare earths are China’s bargaining chip in the trade war — the U.S. is trying to fix that

[Rare earths are China’s bargaining chip in trade war with the U.S.](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/29/rare-earths-china-bargaining-chip-trade-war-us.html)

https://preview.redd.it/8i4mjfljhzff1.png?width=1316&format=png&auto=webp&s=36e42231e36c017e26d515e9fb2b0965b2fb1755

Rare earths refer to 17 elements on the periodic table whose atomic structure gives them special magnetic properties. They’re also the most important bargaining chip in the U.S. and China trade war.

That’s because these rare earth magnets power everything from electric vehicles and wind turbines to defense equipment, data centers and high-tech consumer electronics. The United States used to be an industry leader of rare earth production, but for the last several decades, the[ U.S. and the rest of the world have largely](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/21/rare-earth-magnets-china-exports-surge.html) depended on China for the majority of their rare earths — China mines around 70% and processes around 90% of rare earths.

“China has had the monopoly in this market for a really long time, and that monopoly has only increased,” said Neha Mukherjee, rare earths research manager at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. “The cost of production of these separated rare earths and magnets is very low in China, and any producer outside of China cannot enter the market because these prices are what we called as sub-rational prices.”

In the last several months, rare earths have transformed into a powerful weapon in the trade war between the U.S. and China. The export controls that China placed on rare earths in April disrupted a number of industries, with the [auto sector](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/05/auto-groups-sound-the-alarm-as-chinas-rare-earth-curbs-start-to-bite.html) being particularly hard hit.

“China has slowly built out this export control toolkit, really mimicking and copying U.S. export controls to hit back at U.S. and other countries for actions that China believes are unfair,” said Dewardric McNeal, a managing director at Longview Global and a CNBC contributor. “Although we are seeing it actualized over the last seven months, China has spent the last several years building out this tool kit.”

The United States seems to be getting serious about establishing a domestic rare earths supply chain. In July, the Department of Defense announced a [$400 million investment ](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/pentagon-to-become-largest-shareholder-in-rare-earth-magnet-maker-mp-materials.html)in [MP Materials](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MP/), an American rare earth miner and producer. MP Materials owns the only operational rare earth mine in the U.S. at Mountain Pass, California. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan also backed the company with a $1 billion loan to fund the expansion of MP Materials magnet-making operations.

Other projects are also advancing. [Energy Fuels](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UUUU/) began refining rare earths about five years ago at its White Mesa facility in Utah. The company has historically mined and refined uranium, a radioactive material, and realized it could use a similar process to extract rare earths from monazite. The company produces neodymium-praseodymium oxide, or NdPr material, at commercial scale for use in permanent magnets, but says that it can expand its offerings to include other rare earth elements with the right financial support. The company is already running pilot scale production of some of those other rare earth oxides. 

“Right now, we have the capability to process up to a thousand \[metric\] tons of NdPr. Our plans are in what we call phase two, to increase that up to 6,000 \[metric\] tons of NdPr, which would be up to 6 million electric vehicles,” said Energy Fuels CEO Mark Chalmers. “We also have the capabilities, and are advancing our abilities to produce a number of the other heavy rare earths, mainly dysprosium, terbium and samarium and other elements as required by the United States government. If they choose to have us recover those products in due course with the proper incentives.”

Despite such progress, experts say that the U.S. is far from breaking its dependence on China for rare earth materials. Watch the [video](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/07/29/can-the-us-break-chinas-rare-earth-dominance.html) to learn more.

# JULY 28th, 2025~Northrop Grumman targets leading role in Golden Dome for America missile defense initiative

[Northrop Grumman targets leading role in Golden Dome for America missile defence initiative](https://defence-industry.eu/northrop-grumman-targets-leading-role-in-golden-dome-for-america-missile-defence-initiative/)

[Maybe they need some Critical Minerals & Rare Earths too?](https://preview.redd.it/a4mdskpfkzff1.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1177ecb4e71b1c6d1dfc280822fddc9ee3464f4)

**U.S. defence contractor Northrop Grumman is positioning itself to play a central role in the Pentagon’s planned “Golden Dome for America” missile defence system, as the company expands its involvement in integrated air and missile defence amid rising international demand and new U.S. defence funding priorities.**

During the company’s second-quarter earnings call, Chair and Chief Executive Kathy Warden said Northrop Grumman is prepared to support the U.S. administration’s objective to achieve an initial operational capability for the homeland missile shield within the next few years. Golden Dome, an initiative inspired in part by Israel’s Iron Dome system, aims to provide layered defence against a range of missile and aerial threats to the continental United States.

“With products such as IBCS and GPI, we’re positioned as a key capability provider for missile defence to customers around the globe,” Warden said. “As we look to Golden Dome for America, we see Northrop Grumman playing a crucial role in supporting the administration’s goal to move with speed.” She noted that the company is already working across the full architecture of the program, combining current operational systems with ongoing research and innovation, including space-based interceptors now in testing.

Among the company’s contributions to Golden Dome are the Integrated Battle Command System, or IBCS, which allows disparate sensors and interceptors to function within a single command-and-control network. The system has been fielded by the U.S. Army and is part of several international programs. Northrop Grumman also highlighted the Ground/Air Task-Oriented Radar, or G/ATOR, a multi-mission radar capable of tracking drones, cruise missiles, and other threats, as well as the MQ-4C Triton surveillance drone, which provides wide-area persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. In addition, the company cited programs within its classified portfolio as potentially relevant, though details were not disclosed.

Warden emphasized that the company’s role in missile defence is not limited to hardware. Northrop Grumman has deep experience as a systems integrator, bringing together sensors, interceptors, communications, and software into coordinated defence solutions. She also referenced ongoing development of space-based interceptors, which are expected to be a critical layer in future missile defence frameworks, particularly in countering hypersonic and mid-course threats.

The Golden Dome program comes at a time of heightened global interest in missile defence systems. Northrop Grumman reported an 18% year-over-year increase in international sales for the second quarter of 2025, driven by strong demand in Europe and the Middle East. Warden noted multibillion-dollar opportunities abroad, particularly in integrated air and missile defence, munitions, radars, and airborne early warning platforms. She said the company is benefiting from increasing defence budgets among NATO allies and partners, as nations seek to modernize their air defence capabilities in response to evolving threats.

Northrop Grumman’s international strategy has included establishing industrial partnerships to support local production and capability development. In recent quarters, the company signed agreements with partners in the United Kingdom, South Korea, and Lithuania to facilitate co-production and technology transfer. These partnerships are expected to help Northrop Grumman maintain a foothold in markets that are increasingly focused on indigenous defence manufacturing.

To support anticipated demand growth in both domestic and international markets, Northrop Grumman has invested heavily in missile defence-related infrastructure. Over the past six years, the company has committed $1 billion to expand its solid rocket motor production capabilities. Facilities in West Virginia and Maryland have been upgraded to support small, medium, and hypersonic rocket motors, which are used in a range of interceptor and tactical missile programs. As a result, the company expects to nearly double its annual production capacity for solid rocket motors from 13,000 units in 2024 to 25,000 by 2029. This expansion is seen as a foundational element for future growth in both strategic and tactical weapons segments.

Warden also pointed to recent contract awards, such as a U.S. Navy selection of Northrop Grumman to provide the second-stage solid rocket motor for extended-range missile programs. She noted the company developed and demonstrated the new motor in under one year, underscoring its ability to deliver advanced capabilities on an accelerated timeline.

Golden Dome is part of a broader shift in U.S. defence policy toward faster procurement cycles and reduced barriers between government and industry. Warden credited recent legislative developments, including the fiscal year 2026 budget request and reconciliation bill, for creating a more favorable funding and acquisition environment. The combined legislation reflects a 22% increase in procurement and research, development, test, and evaluation spending over the prior fiscal year. Warden said this shift is already yielding tangible results in programs such as Sentinel and B-21, and she expects similar benefits for new missile defence efforts.

While specific contracts under the Golden Dome program have not yet been awarded, Northrop Grumman’s public statements suggest the company is already engaged in early-stage planning and technology demonstrations in cooperation with U.S. government stakeholders. Analysts say the company’s portfolio and integration expertise position it as a likely frontrunner for key roles in the program.

Looking ahead, Warden said she expects the company’s space segment to benefit significantly from the Golden Dome initiative, especially as space-based sensors and interceptors are integrated into future defence architectures. She described Golden Dome as a “significant driver of increased budget” for the company’s space division, even as the firm navigates other headwinds in civil space markets.

The company’s expansion into missile defence comes amid strong overall financial performance. Northrop Grumman reported $10.4 billion in second-quarter sales, an increase of 9% over the first quarter, with gains in all four business segments. Segment operating margin was 11.8%, and earnings per share rose 28% year-over-year.

I’m a 21-year-old female offering simple, paid hangouts at public places — like cafes, parks, malls, etc. If you’re feeling alone, going through a tough time, or just want someone to talk to and spend time with, I’m here to keep you company 💬🌿

These are strictly casual, respectful hangouts — nothing more, nothing less. Think of it like a peaceful coffee chat, a walk, or just some chill company so you’re not alone.
