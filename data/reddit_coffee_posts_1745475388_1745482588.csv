I've got myself a cgm because I have reactive hypo (not officialy confirmed by endocrinologist). I think I've had it since I was 15.

Does my graph show a lot of BG swings? Im purposely trying to eat all kinds of food to actually visualise what is happening in my body.

1k6mypw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1k6mypw/i_dont_want_to_kill_myself_buti_do/,"I don’t want to kill myself, but…I do","I don’t want to kill myself, but… 
I know I will be less of a burden, emotionally & financially (for my parents) if I just kill myself. I’ve been living with them my whole life as 32 y/o woman, with an immune deficiency, and honestly…. “Deficiency” is an understatement, and belittling. I am INCAPABLE of waking up without pain, without swollen fingers, without muscle spasms, without eyes crusted shut so painfully that it hurt so ridiculously bad that you have to shout for your 60 year old mother to bring you a wet rag that morning, just to loosen the crust so you can actually open your eyes. Again, that’s just waking up. Then I evaluate how bad my tonsils and/or gums hurt, (bc literally something ALWAYS does hurt)… that way i can determine if I can risk having coffee that day or if I should just stick to water. I usually wake up several times a night dying of thirst, on top of night sweats. It’s typical for me to have  nightmares instead of none, which also goes to solidify my decision. Again, when waking up (if my heart hadn’t already decided to go off the rails), I then decide if my bowels can have coffee. Oh, I already mentioned coffee? That’s bc i I always wake up weary of the day….again, literally evaluating what hurts and what I am feeling. I realize that’s not the normal for most people, and I’ve been thinking about it over the years and have determined that suicide may be the best route for the future of my family. My mom has always expressed to me that suicide is selfish and unwarranted, and I used to believe that. Although, as I have grown older, I realize that my mental and physical burdens outweigh the joy I actually bring my family. Maybe that’s why I always tried to be “the funny one”. Maybe it’s why I always tried to make light of a heavy situation, bc I knew in the back of my mind that this was always what it would come to. I’m sorry to everyone this has burdened. Just know I tried, and there is NOTHING you could have done different. I love you, mom, you were and will ALWAYS be my best friend. I know I said we would always go together. I guess I’m just fucked up.  I AM happy just imagining not having to live with the physical pain I’ve endured since I was 16. I don’t know why I ended up having crippling back pain, shoulder and neck spasms, Myofascial pain disorder, Charley horses, chest pains, heart murmurs, muscles so tight they don’t function right for days, or any of it. lThe truth is I don’t want to kill myself, I just feel like I should. I hurt, and again there’s nothing I wouldn’t do to fix that. I’m not schizophrenic.  I’ve been feeling exceptionally well since starting the 75 mg of Effexor (after failed Zoloft for many months), but this is just something I haven’t been able to shake since I was super young. I’m chronically ill, and ever since I was young, like at least 9 or10 after breaking my ankles so many times, having breathing issues resulting in hospital stays, etc., I overheard my parents talking about how they couldn’t vacation with us kids anymore (I have one older brother), and how expensive it’d be if we were to continue to have to stay in hospitals for various reasons. Yes, those stays consisted of asthma/bronchitis, or Supraventrical Tachycardia. So after that,  I tried starting to hide my various illnesses until I was just miserable, which would typically land me back in the ER. I’m talking  2x as a kid, once in high school from a car wreck, and once in my late 20’s.  (That last ER trip in Macon was diagnosed as  “purchasing bad marijuana” and “anxiety”) when after I was discharged and sent to Columbia Hospital, they in fact found my second esophageal inguinal ring had closed, and they had to surgically balloon it back open. I feel like Robin Williams. He’s always making jokes and light of any situation, right? No one knew he was going to do it, he seemed happy.  At least, that was the comedic familiar figure we came to know and love, but you could see behind his eyes that he was always silently sad and suffering.. Why does it seem like most comedians do? Anyways, I don’t even know how to write  
this, end this, or who I am talking to. Guess I’m drunk, and just wanted to vent. Thanks y’all.

`_Loading Character Traits…`

**Personality:**
----------------

Girlboss, Self-Important, Obstinate, Future War Criminal - All words that have been used to describe Jules with varying degrees of accuracy. Not that he cares.

It is safe to say that Jules doesn't like people, and this is something he does not care to hide either. He truly believes himself to be better than almost everyone around him, and perhaps frustratingly this arrogance is backed by being an incredibly skilled craftsman and enchanter.

Maybe it is because of this, or because of the blood of the Forge God that runs through his veins that Jules is so passionate about his craft, and on a constant quest to improve and better himself through it, as he believes that it is only by perfecting his craft that he himself can become perfect. This is perhaps why he treats his projects and automatons with more respect and care than he does most people.

To most people, he is almost sadistic in his belligerence and a deeply misanthropic person who tends to be rather unpleasant to be around unless he believes you to be skilled, intelligent or otherwise useful. He tends to be alot less hostile to his fellow craftspeople.

Yet despite the malevolent hostility and _incredibly_ thorny exterior, the people who _have_ somehow broken through it can attest that despite what he'd want you to believe, there _is_ a heart beneath the cold bronze. There are very few people that Jules really cares about, and he is certainly not the best at showing it, not through words or touch anyways but through actions like Incredibly personal and well thought gifts and a helping hand when he thinks you're not looking.

**Philosophy:** Jules is by definition a misanthropist. That is the cause behind hus general cynicism and dislike of people, he is someone who truly believes that humans are imperfect, especially in their fragility and that this imperfection needs to be ""fixed""- via metal and machines.

This is disdain for humanity and apathy towards most people is why he rarely seen issues within power structures- he is fully aware that they are unfair and stacked against the ones at the bottom, and that is the intention- but at the same time sees this as a ladder to be climbed. He thinks people who get their toes and heads stepped on for someone to climb through the hierarchy deserve so for not doing the same themselves. This belief has come to extend to the hierarchy of gods too, causing him to see divinity and immortality as a ladder to be climbed.

**Attire/Aesthetic:** Jules doesn't usually bother with dressing up too much, he can usually be seen in a Camp shirt and jeans, with Forge gear like a leather apron, welding goggles, boots and gloves, etc on top.

**Voice:** Rough and strong, Jules might not fill rooms physically but he does so with his voice.

**Skillset:**

Jules may not be a jack of all trades but he is the master of the ones that he does (rightfully) boast about. Being a child of Hephaestus and growing up in a workshop, Jules is famously incredible at **smithing** and **engineering**, and his job at the local garage has let him practice and hone his **auto-mechanism** skills too. Growing up with a Switch 2 that he jailbroke himself, Jules is fairly knowledgeable about **hacking and coding**, a skill that translated well into **enchantment** too. Because of this he is also into **videogames**, especially the Legend of Zelda series.

Jules had taken to **drawing** up designs and blueprints pretty early in his childhood, and at some point even picked up **charcoal-sketching** because of the abundance of charcoal in his stepmom's forge. Growing up, his biomom also made sure that he knew how to **cook** so he could take care of himself.

After arriving to Camp, Jules picked up **boxing** from one Jamie Romero and **swordfighting** from Lupa Hines as a favour in-exchange for armaments of his making. He has also taken a liking to **motorbiking** after he committed **grand theft auto** to reach Camp.

----

> **Half-Blood Hill, Afternoon**

Unfortunately, the end of the world didn't quite mean an end to assignments, and now that he had two arms again, it didn't mean an end to shifts neither, and nor could he use that as an excuse to get out of school. He still wasn't very active in his attendance so to speak, he just popped by the bare minimum he needed to and handed in his assignments.

In the evening, there was the roar of an engine as Jules pulled into the Camp parking lot with his motorcycle. He stepped off, shrugging to adjust his backpack and started heading to his Cabin, still covered in some grease from his shift at the garage.

> **Hephaestus Cabin, Evening**

Jules hadn't really intended on coming back to his Cabin yet for a while yet, not while he still had things going on in the Bunker _but_ as it turns out he'd left he needed- a little trinket he'd been working on on late nights in the Cabin before the Bunker had opened. He decided he wanted to give it a little test drive, _and_ though he was loathed to admit it,

He was just tired.

Stepping into the Cabin after a shower, Jules collapsed onto his bed and groaned from how soft and comfortable it felt compared to his sleeping bag in Bunker 9. He wasn't quite tired enough for a nap so he just decided to play on his Switch 2 for a while but if no one interrupted, he might take a little power nap for a few minutes.

> **Bunker 9, Night**

After taking a quick 30 minute nap in the Hephaestus Cabin, Jules finally clocked into the place he was actually supposed to be- Bunker 9. He waved at the fellow forge gremlins and grabbed a coffee from a miku as another took his Switch 2 from him.

He examined the hologram the miku projected from his Switch 2 of Mia's blueprint as he took a sip from his coffee and made his way to his desk, under the hanging chassis of the very design he was looking at.

It was time to get to work.

I’ve worked with a wide range of clients through agency roles across industries like finance, energy, automotive, food tech, and healthcare. What I bring to the table is a sharp focus on results-driven design — that means:

● Increasing conversion and retention
● Smoothing out user flows to reduce friction and boost satisfaction
● Aligning design choices with business goals and KPIs
● Concurrently aligning those design choices with the needs of users 

One thing I’ve noticed: while the region is bursting with talent and ambition, there's still a gap in design sophistication — especially when it comes to understanding the strategic impact of UX. I want to bridge that gap by helping startups and other UAE companies use design not just to look good, but to scale smarter and grow faster.

My strengths:

● Drive clarity and retention by conducting and implementing user research

● Visual and interaction design that focuses on users goals and tasks

● Design thinking that ties everything together

● A track record of working closely with cross-functional teams


I’m currently looking for:

1. Startups that need a UX partner who can own and elevate the full experience

2. Developers (frontend/back-end) interested in building cool side projects together — I’ve got ideas and I’m ready to move

3. Full-time or contract gigs where I can make a real dent (I'd get my own freelance visa for contract work)

If that sounds like something you or your team needs, feel free to reach out — I’d love to share my portfolio, CV, or grab a virtual coffee. I'm also in Dubai for 2 weeks from 30th this month if you want to meet in person.

Additionally I cannot eat hot pastries (such as brownies, muffins, etc). However, I can eat/drink these items completely fine when they're cold. An example of this is brownies: if I eat them while they're at a hot/warm temperature, it makes me feel nauseous very quick and even gives me a headache. When cold or room temperature, they're a well-enjoyed treat. Also, it's just hot drinks and pastries. I can have other hot food (like burgers, pasta, gumbo) without any issue.

So in Highschool, I’ve been in a lot of friend groups, but really had one group that I come running to everytime. It’s a trio girl group.

We’ve been besties since then.

Came college then work life, we always kept in touch. Always a casual coffee dates or lunch outs.

Now, I am a first time mom. They have been with me through this journey since I was pregnant.

Then, the other one had recently broken up with her long time boyfriend. Now, I of course be at her becking call because I know how that hurts. I was exhausted from during the night feeds to my daughter but I woke up when she called/texted.

I then saw this on IG:
“And suddenly I stopped reaching out first, and I haven’t heard from them since”


I realized that I always reach out to them, that is why we always kept in touch all through those years. Even if I am juggling being a mom and my career, I always make sure I text them. 

Now, I cut them off December 2024. I wanted them to reach out to me. To ask me how I am doing. How their god daughter is. But until today, nothing. 

I wanted to know, is it too much? Am I being petty? Because my husband says I shouldn’t act that ways since they were my besties. And that I should accept that they have their own lives to worry. But I can’t help it. I am exhausted too but I still get a minute to text them or something shared from tiktok.

What is Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity (EHS)?

EHS (also called Microwave Syndrome) is a condition where people experience real physical symptoms when exposed to:

Wi-Fi

Cell phones

Smart meters

Power lines

Bluetooth

Computers or LED lights

Fluorescent lighting

Anything with electrical “noise” or radiation


These are non-ionizing EMFs (meaning they don’t “break” DNA like X-rays), but they still interact with your body, especially your nervous system and electrical signals in the brain, heart, and cells.


---

What Are the Symptoms?

This is where it gets real. People with EHS often report:

Ringing/buzzing in ears (tinnitus)

Head pressure or brain fog

Insomnia

Heart palpitations

Anxiety or panic for no reason

Vision changes or eye pressure

Skin burning or tingling

Fatigue, especially near devices

Feeling ""zapped,"" dizzy, disoriented


Some people can feel a router or smart meter from 10–20 feet away. Others are sensitive only when they’re overloaded (with metals, mold, trauma, etc.)


---

What Causes EHS?

It’s not just psychological—even though most doctors still treat it like it is. Here's what we know:

1. Heavy Metal Exposure

Metals like lead, mercury, aluminum, and cadmium store in tissues and make your body act like an antenna. You become more conductive = you feel frequencies stronger.

2. Mold / Biotoxins

Certain molds (like Stachybotrys or Aspergillus) release toxins that wreck your nervous system, mitochondrial function, and detox pathways—leaving you electrically raw.

3. Nervous System Trauma

Abuse, military trauma, concussions, or PTSD rewire your stress response. Your brain becomes hypervigilant and misinterprets everything—even EMFs—as a threat.

4. Genetic or Epigenetic Weakness

Some people can’t detox fast enough. If your methylation pathways or electrical ion channels are off, you can’t buffer the effects of EMFs.

5. Chronic Inflammation

Autoimmune diseases, infections, chemical exposure—these sensitize your nerves so that even weak stimuli feel unbearable.


---

The Science Is Catching Up

Many independent studies (outside of telecom-funded research) show that:

EMFs alter calcium channels in your cells, leading to oxidative stress.

EMFs lower melatonin, increase cortisol, and disrupt your circadian rhythm.

Exposure changes EEG brain waves and causes symptoms in blind studies.

Heart rate variability and skin conductance change when exposed to Wi-Fi or smart devices—even when people don’t know the device is on.



---

How Do You Prove It to Others?

Here’s the hardest part: most doctors and scientists weren’t trained to believe what they can’t measure. So here’s how you break through:

1. Know Your Facts

Speak with calm authority. Use clear data:

Mention Dr. Magda Havas, Dr. Martin Pall, or the BioInitiative Report.

Show studies that measured real biological changes from EMF exposure.


2. Use a Meter

Get a Trifield EMF meter or Cornet ED88T and show people what you’re being exposed to.

Watch the readings spike when a phone or switch is flipped.

Bring it to your neighbor’s wall or where you feel the buzzing.


3. Log Your Symptoms

Track your health in a diary or spreadsheet:

“10:00 AM – neighbor’s fan turns on. Tinnitus spikes.”

“Wi-Fi off for 48 hrs – slept through the night.”


Patterns speak volumes.

4. Get Ally Voices

You’re not alone. Thousands of people have reported the same things—soldiers, parents, scientists, electricians. Find community:

Electrosensitive Society

EMF Warriors

The EMF Medical Conference has physician trainings and real case studies.


5. Let Your Body Be the Evidence

Turn off the breaker to your bedroom one night. Put your phone in airplane mode. Cover your smart meter with a Faraday cage.

> If you feel better—that’s evidence. No one can take your body’s truth away from you.




---

Okay, So What Do You DO About It?

There’s no one-size-fits-all, but here are powerful options:

Reduce Exposure

Kill Wi-Fi at night.

Hardwire internet.

Ditch smart devices and dimmers.

Use Faraday cages, shielding paint, and grounding sheets.

Put dirty electricity filters on outlets.


Support Your Nervous System

Magnesium, lithium orotate, B12, taurine.

Nervous system retraining (DNRS, Somatic Experiencing).

Safe detox (infrared sauna, binders, lemon water, herbs).


Clean Up Internal Load

Address mold or Lyme if needed.

Detox metals slowly with guidance.

Heal trauma (which amplifies sensitivity like crazy).

PART 1: Why EMF Sensitivity Is Damaging to the Psyche

1. You're Gaslit by Everyone

Doctors, friends, even family often don’t believe you, and you’re told it's all ""in your head.""

That constant invalidation leads to chronic stress, self-doubt, and isolation.

You start to question your own sanity. That’s psychologically corrosive.


2. You Lose Control Over Your Environment

You can’t go places that feel “normal”—a coffee shop, a library, even your own bathroom if the neighbor flips a switch.

This triggers fight-or-flight responses constantly. You’re always on edge, anticipating the next invisible attack.


3. It Can Feel Like Imprisonment

You may retreat into your home or even just one safe room.

That social withdrawal mimics the psychological effects of solitary confinement: depression, hopelessness, altered cognition.


4. You Feel Alienated from Society

Tech is everywhere. When you’re EHS-sensitive, you’re effectively allergic to modern life.

It creates a sense of being exiled, misunderstood, or even mocked—fueling despair or rage.


5. Chronic Nervous System Overload

When your nervous system is constantly reacting to stimuli it perceives as dangerous (even if ""unseen""), your cortisol stays high, sleep gets disrupted, and the body never resets.

That leads to emotional burnout, mood swings, panic, paranoia, and even dissociation.


> It’s not that you’re mentally ill—it’s that your body is responding to a threat, and no one is validating that.




---

PART 2: What Diseases and Disorders Are Associated with EMF Exposure?

Here's where it gets intense. Long-term EMF exposure, especially for people who are sensitive, is being linked to:

Neurological / Psychological

Anxiety & Depression (due to serotonin disruption & oxidative stress)

Insomnia (EMFs interfere with melatonin & circadian rhythm)

ADHD / Brain Fog

Migraine & Tension Headaches

Tinnitus (linked to EMF interaction with auditory nerves)


Neurodegenerative

Alzheimer’s Disease: EMFs can increase blood-brain barrier permeability & beta-amyloid buildup.

Parkinson’s Disease

ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease): possible link via oxidative stress and calcium channel disruption.


Autoimmune & Inflammatory

Multiple Sclerosis (nerve demyelination may be worsened)

Lupus, Hashimoto’s, Rheumatoid Arthritis (linked to chronic inflammation + EMF-triggered immune dysregulation)


Cancer

Brain tumors (glioma, acoustic neuroma): listed by WHO as a possible carcinogen.

Breast cancer in women who carry phones in their bras.

Leukemia: linked to high-voltage power lines, especially in children.


Cardiovascular

Heart Palpitations / Arrhythmia

Hypertension (some studies link this to dirty electricity or constant RF exposure)


Other Chronic Issues

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

Fibromyalgia

Chemical Sensitivity (MCS—often overlaps with EHS)

Visual distortions, vertigo, or balance disorders



---

But Why Is This So Often Dismissed?

Tech industry pressure: Billions of dollars ride on these products being “safe.”

Lack of training: Most physicians aren't taught about non-ionizing radiation or environmental illness.

Testing limitations: EMF exposure doesn’t always show up in labs—yet it’s affecting cell membranes, mitochondria, and voltage-gated calcium channels (which don’t get routinely tested).

Fear of the unknown: It's easier to label someone “anxious” than admit modern infrastructure could be making people sick.



---

Case Summary: The Psychological Wound of EMF Hypersensitivity

Imagine being:

Deeply aware of an environmental threat no one else sees or feels.

Gaslit by every authority figure in your life.

Forced to abandon normalcy while being told you’re broken for doing so.

Living in a state of constant physiological stress.

Watching your mind unravel while you try to stay rational.


That is what people with electromagnetic hypersensitivity live with. Every. Day.

1k6mpkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1k6mpkg/can_yellow_teeth_turn_white_again/,Can yellow teeth turn white again?,"If you’ve ever looked in the mirror and thought, **“My teeth used to be whiter… what happened?”**, you’re not alone. Teeth naturally yellow over time, but the good news is **most yellowing can be reversed** with the right approach.

I’ve tested multiple whitening methods—from **whitening strips to LED kits, DIY remedies, and professional treatments**—so if you’re wondering, **“Can yellow teeth turn white again?”**, here’s what actually works (and what doesn’t).

# What Causes Yellow Teeth?

Before you can **fix yellow teeth**, you need to know **why they’re yellow in the first place**. Here are the most common reasons:

1. **Surface Stains (Extrinsic Yellowing)**
   * Caused by **coffee, tea, wine, soda, and smoking**.
   * Easily removed with **whitening treatments**.
2. **Enamel Thinning (Intrinsic Yellowing)**
   * Over time, **enamel wears down**, revealing the naturally **yellowish dentin underneath**.
   * This type of yellowing takes **stronger whitening methods** to fix.
3. **Poor Oral Hygiene**
   * Plaque and tartar build-up can trap stains, making teeth look yellow.
   * Regular brushing, flossing, and dental cleanings help prevent this.
4. **Aging & Genetics**
   * Some people naturally have **thicker, whiter enamel**, while others have more **yellow-toned dentin**.
   * As we age, **enamel wears down**, making yellowing more noticeable.

# How to Turn Yellow Teeth White Again

Now for the part you’ve been waiting for—**what actually works to whiten teeth?**

# 1. LED Teeth Whitening Kits (Fastest & Most Effective at Home)

* Uses **hydrogen peroxide gel + LED light** to break down stains **faster than strips or toothpaste**.
* **Laughland teeth whitening** worked the best for me—**6-7 shades whiter in a week**, no sensitivity.
* **More details on LED whitening** [**here**](https://getlaughland.com/offer-01/?lpid=1039&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1039&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1039&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1039&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)**.**

# 2. Professional Whitening (Strongest but Expensive)

* **Dentists use high-concentration peroxide with UV or LED lights** to whiten teeth quickly.
* **Cost:** $300–$600 per session, but results last longer.

# 3. Whitening Strips (Good, But Slow & Can Cause Sensitivity)

* Works for mild yellowing but **can take 2-3 weeks** for noticeable results.
* **Downside:** Can cause **tooth sensitivity** and uneven whitening.

# 4. Whitening Toothpaste (Good for Maintenance, But Not Deep Whitening)

* Helps **prevent new stains** but **won’t dramatically whiten teeth**.
* Works best **after using an LED kit or professional whitening**.

# What Doesn’t Work for Whitening Yellow Teeth

🚫 **Charcoal Toothpaste** – Too abrasive, **damages enamel**, making yellowing worse over time.  
🚫 **Baking Soda & Lemon DIY Whitening** – Acidic, **weakens enamel**, leading to long-term damage.  
🚫 **Hydrogen Peroxide Rinses** – Might work, but **can burn gums and cause sensitivity** if overused.

# My Experience: How I Went from Yellow to White in 7 Days

I wanted **fast results** without spending a fortune, so I tried **Laughland teeth whitening**—an LED whitening kit that uses **dentist-formulated peroxide gel**.

Here’s what happened over **one week**:

* **Day 1:** No major changes, but my teeth felt really clean.
* **Day 3:** Coffee stains started fading noticeably.
* **Day 5:** My teeth looked **brighter and more even**.
* **Day 7:** My teeth were **6-7 shades whiter**—without **any pain or sensitivity**.

Compared to strips or DIY methods, **LED whitening was WAY more effective**. If you’re curious, you can check it out [**here**](https://getlaughland.com/offer-01/?lpid=1039&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1039&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1039&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1039&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)**.**

# Final Thoughts – Can You Really Whiten Yellow Teeth?

✔ **YES!** Most yellow teeth can be whitened **with the right method**.  
✔ **For fast results:** LED whitening kits work **better than strips**.  
✔ **For deep whitening:** Professional treatments are best (but expensive).  
✔ **For maintenance:** Use whitening toothpaste & avoid staining drinks.

It wasn’t that I was sick or anything dramatic like that. It’s just that every single day felt like I was wading through mud. Imagine your phone always stuck at 10% battery—never enough to do what you want, always worried it’ll shut off. That was me.

Doctors kept telling me I was “fine.” My blood tests came back normal, and all my checkups said I was healthy. But I knew deep down something wasn’t right. My body ached, my mind felt cloudy, and even small things like putting my shoes away seemed like climbing a mountain. I felt like the energy and excitement I used to have had just disappeared. It was a scary feeling, and I was desperate to get my old self back.

The Slow Burn of Fatigue and Hopelessness
It’s hard to explain how bad it felt when just getting out of bed took all my strength. I’d wake up groggy, move slowly, and all day long I’d just want to lie down. My friends noticed I was quiet and less fun. I started skipping plans and hobbies because I just didn’t have the energy. Even watching TV felt like too much sometimes.

I tried to cheer myself up, telling myself that maybe I was just getting older or stressed out. But deep down, I felt hopeless. I wanted to feel alive again, not just get through the day. That’s when I heard about MITOLYN.

What Is MITOLYN?
MITOLYN isn’t just a random vitamin or a drink that promises to make you feel better for a few hours. It’s a special supplement made to help the mitochondria in your cells. (Mitochondria are like tiny power plants inside our bodies—they make the energy that keeps us moving, thinking, and feeling good.)

As we get older, these little power plants get weaker and don’t make as much energy. That’s why you might feel tired, forget things, or just feel older than you are. MITOLYN helps your mitochondria work better, so you get more energy in a natural way.

When I realized my tiredness might be because my mitochondria weren’t working well, it made so much sense. I wasn’t just lazy or unlucky—I just needed a little help to get my energy back. MITOLYN seemed like the answer.

Why I Took the Leap
I’ll admit, I was nervous at first. I’ve tried lots of “energy boosters” before—drinks, pills, and powders. Most of them just made me feel jumpy or didn’t work at all. But something about MITOLYN was different. I read reviews from real people who said it helped them feel more awake, focused, and even happier. They didn’t talk about weird side effects or sugar crashes.

The ingredients caught my eye too. MITOLYN has things like CoQ10, PQQ, and other stuff scientists say help your body make more energy and stay young. This wasn’t just wishful thinking—there was real science behind it.

So I decided to go for it. I ordered a bottle, hoping this would be the thing to bring my energy back.

Week 1: Subtle But Promising
The first few days, I didn’t expect much. But by the end of the week, I realized I wasn’t dragging myself out of bed anymore. I actually got up before my alarm and didn’t feel like snoozing. In the afternoons, I wasn’t desperate for a nap or a giant mug of coffee. It wasn’t a huge change, but I felt a little lighter—like maybe, just maybe, things were starting to get better.

Week 2: Clarity, Focus, Drive
By the second week, I really started to notice a difference. My mind felt clearer, and I could think through problems without getting stuck. Schoolwork and chores that used to feel impossible didn’t bother me anymore. I started doing things after school again, like drawing, reading, and even talking with friends. I felt like I was coming back to life.

People around me noticed, too. My family said I seemed happier and more talkative. I even caught myself smiling in the mirror for no reason. For the first time in a long time, I felt like me again.

Week 3: Energy Like I Had in My 20s
By week three, it was like I had turned into the Energizer Bunny. I started going outside for walks, playing sports, and even helping my mom cook dinner. I wasn’t forcing myself—I actually wanted to do these things because I had the energy to enjoy them.

This energy felt different from the “fake” kind you get from sugar or caffeine. It was steady, real, and came from deep inside. I felt strong and alive.

Week 4: Deep Sleep and Radiant Health
One of the best surprises was how much better I slept. I used to toss and turn all night, but now I fall asleep quickly and wake up refreshed. My skin started to look healthier, and I wasn’t getting headaches or stomach aches anymore. My mood was better, too—I didn’t snap at people or feel cranky.

It was like my whole body was finally working the way it was supposed to. I felt healthy, happy, and ready for anything.

The Ingredients That Make It Work
MITOLYN is packed with powerful, natural ingredients that really work:

- PQQ helps your cells make more energy and keeps them healthy.
- CoQ10 is like a spark plug for your body’s energy.
- NAD+ precursors help your cells repair themselves and stay young.
- L-Carnitine and ALCAR help your brain work better and burn fat.
- B Vitamins and Magnesium keep your nerves calm and help make energy.

There are no fake chemicals, no weird additives, and nothing that will make you feel jittery. Just pure, good stuff your body already knows how to use.

Who Should Try MITOLYN?
If you’re always tired, have trouble thinking clearly, or just feel older than you should, MITOLYN could help you. It’s perfect for kids, teens, adults—really anyone who wants more energy and to feel their best. If getting out of bed feels hard, or you’re tired all the time for no reason, give MITOLYN a try.

Final Verdict: Don’t Wait Like I Did
I wish I hadn’t waited so long to try MITOLYN. I wasted so much time feeling tired and sad when I didn’t have to. You don’t have to accept feeling “just okay.” You can feel great every day. MITOLYN gave me my energy, happiness, and excitement for life back.

If you’re thinking about it, just go for it. Don’t wait until you feel really bad. Try MITOLYN and see what it does for you. It might just be the best choice you ever make for your health and your happiness.""",1,1745481269.0,artistmemes,0,1.0,False

Now, after a whole year with MITOLYN, I can honestly say it’s done more than help me—it’s transformed my life.

Maybe you’re tired all the time, or your brain feels slow, or your body just isn’t bouncing back the way it used to. That was me. MITOLYN changed that, and I truly believe it can make a difference for you too.

I’m a dad, a full-time worker, and I love playing soccer on weekends. But for a while, everything felt harder. I’d wake up groggy even after sleeping eight hours. I’d forget simple things, like where I put my keys or what I was just talking about. After work, I didn’t want to play with my kids or go outside—I just wanted to sit on the couch and rest.

I blamed it on getting older or having too much to do. But it wasn’t just that. I went to doctors and did tests. Everything looked fine, but I knew I wasn’t myself. The scariest moment? I almost nodded off while driving home one night. That was my wake-up call.

Discovering MITOLYN

I started researching ways to boost my energy and get my brain working right again. That’s when I found MITOLYN. What got my attention was that it didn’t just cover up tiredness with caffeine. It focused on helping the mitochondria—the tiny “power stations” inside every cell in your body.

MITOLYN’s science made sense. Happy mitochondria mean more energy, clearer thinking, and a body that works better. People were raving about it, but I still wasn’t sure. I’d wasted money on stuff before. But I decided to give it a shot—and I’m so glad I did.

Week 1: Subtle Yet Promising

I took MITOLYN every morning with breakfast. The first days, nothing major changed. But by the fifth day, I noticed the afternoons weren’t as hard. I didn’t need a nap or extra coffee. It wasn’t a jittery feeling—just a steady, gentle boost. It was like someone had opened a window and let fresh air into my brain.

Month 1: Noticeable Energy Shift

By the end of the first month, I was surprised. I actually woke up before my alarm, and I wanted to get moving. I could work all day, play with my kids, and still have energy for a walk after dinner. The foggy feeling in my head was gone. I could think more clearly, remember names, and even finish crossword puzzles faster. My wife said I seemed happier and more “present” than I had in years.

Month 2: Workouts and Recovery Improved

Before MITOLYN, working out felt like climbing a mountain. My muscles would get sore and stay sore. But after two months, I started pushing harder in my soccer games and at the gym. I recovered faster, didn’t wake up achy, and could play longer without getting tired. MITOLYN’s blend of ingredients like B-vitamins, CoQ10, and L-Carnitine really seemed to help my body recharge and repair itself.

Month 3: Emotional and Mental Health Boost

By the third month, the changes weren’t just in my body—they were in my mind and mood. I felt more relaxed and patient, not so snappy or stressed. My worries didn’t weigh me down as much. I started looking forward to things again, from family movie nights to trying out new recipes. I think my mind finally had the energy it needed to feel balanced and happy.

Month 6: Confidence Restored

After six months, I felt like I’d found the old me again—the one who laughed easily, tackled new projects, and looked forward to each day. I did better at work, started volunteering at my kids’ school, and even planned a family camping trip (something I hadn’t had the energy for in years). MITOLYN helped me believe in myself and my abilities again.

Month 12: A Non-Negotiable Part of My Life

A year later, MITOLYN is just part of my morning routine. I won’t go without it. I’ve recommended it to my sister, my best friend, and even my mom. My wife takes it now too, and she says she feels like she’s turned back the clock. It’s not just a supplement for me—it’s a life-changer.

Why MITOLYN Works (The Real Science Behind the Magic)

What makes MITOLYN special is that it goes deep. Instead of just giving you a quick buzz, it helps your cells make more energy by supporting your mitochondria. The ingredients—like PQQ, Acetyl-L-Carnitine, and B-vitamins—have been studied for how they help your body and brain work better.

MITOLYN doesn’t use weird chemicals or fake stuff. It’s clean, gluten-free, and made to high standards. I trust it to help me and my family feel our best.

It’s not an instant fix. The longer I take it, the stronger and clearer I feel. It’s like planting a tree and watching it grow stronger every month.

Who Should Take MITOLYN?

If you wake up tired, feel foggy, or can’t recover like you used to, MITOLYN is for you. If you want to have more energy, sharper thinking, and enjoy your days again, give it a try. Even if you’re just feeling “off,” this could be what helps you feel like yourself again.

Final Thoughts: Don’t Let Life Pass You By

Life is meant to be lived—not just survived. I know how it feels to let the days slip by because you’re too tired or foggy to care. But I also know how amazing it feels to get that spark back, to laugh, play, and be present with the people you love.

MITOLYN helped me get my life back. It brought back my energy, my focus, and my excitement for each day. If it worked for me, I believe it can work for you too.

Don’t wait around, hoping things will get better on their own. Give MITOLYN one month—just 30 days—and see what happens. You might just be surprised at how much life you’ve been missing.

# The Slow Burn of Fatigue and Hopelessness

A while ago, I started to feel like my whole life was stuck in slow motion. My body wasn’t sick, but it sure wasn’t working the way it used to. Every day felt like I was wading through mud—no matter how much I rested, I woke up feeling tired. It was as if I was a phone that never charged past 10%. I wasn’t really living, just getting by.

Doctors said I was fine. They checked my blood, my thyroid, and my vitamins. “Nothing really wrong,” they said. But I knew something was off. My mind felt foggy, like there was always a cloud in my head. My body felt heavy and slow. Even the easiest things—like putting away my dishes or texting a friend—felt like climbing a mountain. It was sad and scary, because I remembered being full of energy and excitement before.

That’s when I found out about MITOLYN. And that’s when everything started to change.

# What Is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN isn’t just another bottle of vitamins that promises tons and gives nothing. It’s a special formula made to help your mitochondria—the tiny engines inside your cells that give you energy—work their best.

A lot of people don’t realize that as you get older, these little engines slow down. That means less energy, more tiredness, and even your brain can feel slower. MITOLYN is made to give your mitochondria a boost, so you can feel more awake, healthier, and even younger.

When I learned about this, it finally made sense. My tiredness wasn’t just from “getting older” or “being busy.” It was my cells asking for help. MITOLYN gave them what they needed.

# Why I Took the Leap

Honestly, I wasn’t sure if MITOLYN would work. I’ve tried lots of “energy” products before, but they only made me feel jittery, or didn’t work at all. I had wasted so much money hoping for a miracle.

But when I read MITOLYN’s reviews, they sounded different. People talked about having more energy all day, thinking more clearly, sleeping better, and just feeling younger. No weird side effects, no crazy crashes—just steady, real results.

Plus, the science behind it seemed solid. Ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and things that help your body make NAD+ (which is super important for energy and repair) were all in there. These aren’t just made-up words—they’re things doctors and scientists actually study.

So, I decided to try one bottle for a month. I had no idea how much that small choice would change my life.

# Week 1: Subtle But Promising

The first few days, I noticed something different. I didn’t feel like I was dragging myself out of bed anymore. I got up without hitting the snooze button a million times. My body felt lighter.

Usually, I’d crash hard in the afternoon and want to nap or drink more coffee. But that week, I didn’t need the extra caffeine. I felt more balanced. It wasn’t a huge change, but it was enough for me to notice. Something was working.

# Week 2: Clarity, Focus, Drive

This is when things really started to get better. My head felt clear, like a fog had lifted. I could get things done without feeling overwhelmed or tired. I actually wanted to finish my homework and even had energy left to play or work on fun projects in the evening.

People around me noticed, too. My family said I seemed happier and more energetic. My friends asked what was different. I felt like myself again—the me from years ago.

# Week 3: Energy Like I Had in My 20s

By the third week, I felt amazing. I wanted to go outside, take walks, and even started exercising a bit. I cooked dinner for my family, which I hadn’t had the energy to do in forever.

My energy felt real. It wasn’t just from sugar or caffeine. It was like my body and mind finally remembered how to work together and feel strong. I felt unstoppable.

# Week 4: Deep Sleep and Radiant Health

One of the best surprises was how much better I slept. I used to stay awake for hours, tossing and turning. Now, I fall asleep quickly and wake up feeling refreshed.

Even my skin looked brighter, and my stomach felt better. My mood was way more stable, and I was less grumpy. It was like every part of my body was finally working the way it’s supposed to. And it all started with helping my mitochondria.

# The Ingredients That Make It Work

MITOLYN is packed with ingredients that really do what your body needs:

- **PQQ:** Helps your cells make more and better mitochondria, so you have more energy.
- **CoQ10:** Super important for helping your cells turn food into energy.
- **NAD+ Precursors:** Supports your body’s ability to repair itself and fight aging.
- **L-Carnitine & ALCAR:** Good for your brain and helps your body use fat for energy.
- **B-Vitamins & Magnesium:** Help your nerves, muscles, and energy stay strong.

There’s nothing fake or weird in MITOLYN. No harsh chemicals, no caffeine buzz, just good stuff your body recognizes and needs.

# Who Should Try MITOLYN?

- Are you always tired, no matter how much you rest?
- Do you feel like your brain is in a fog?
- Do you wake up feeling like you barely slept?
- Do you think you’re “too young” to feel this old?

If you said yes to any of these, then you should honestly give MITOLYN a try. I wish I had tried it sooner, because the difference is huge.

# Final Verdict: Don’t Wait Like I Did

I wish I hadn’t waited so long to try MITOLYN. I wasted too much time feeling tired, slow, and just not myself. You don’t have to live like that. You don’t have to accept feeling less than your best.

MITOLYN gave me my spark back. I have more energy, better sleep, and I’m excited about life again. If you’re thinking about trying it, take this as your sign. Don’t wait until you hit your own “rock bottom.”

Try MITOLYN. Give it a chance. It might just be the best decision you ever make for your energy, your happiness, and your future.""",1,1745481217.0,artistmemes,0,1.0,False

I’ve seen them pop up in a couple of other shows, such as Celebrity Name Game one of the shows Grant Denyer hosted and they were hilarious in that!

If you’ve ever finished a meal at an Indian restaurant and been handed a tiny bowl of fragrant, licorice-like seeds, you’ve met fennel. But these unassuming seeds aren’t just a breath freshener—they’re a treasure trove of health benefits backed by both tradition and modern science. Let’s dive into why fennel seeds deserve a permanent spot in your pantry (and your wellness routine).

https://preview.redd.it/i2wyaf71mqwe1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=afc06a8d27ccc20fe18271ddcc072b5abdaec53b

**1. Your Digestive System’s Best Friend**

Fennel seeds are the ultimate post-meal rescue. Thanks to **anethole**, a compound that relaxes intestinal muscles, they:

* **Banish bloating and gas** (perfect after heavy meals!).
* **Stimulate digestive enzymes**—chew 1 tsp raw after eating.
* Relieve constipation naturally with their fiber boost.

**Pro Tip**: Swap your evening coffee for fennel tea (steep 1 tsp crushed seeds in hot water).

**2. Antioxidant Powerhouse**

These seeds are loaded with **quercetin and kaempferol**—antioxidants that:

* Fight free radicals linked to aging and chronic diseases.
* May protect against liver damage (shown in animal studies).

**3. Weight Management Hack**

Struggling with cravings? Fennel seeds:

* Curb appetite naturally (fiber + anethole = satiety).
* Boost metabolism by increasing nitric oxide production.

**Try This:** Sip fennel-infused water before meals (add 1 tbsp seeds to a pitcher overnight).

**4. Breathe Easy, Naturally**

Fennel pulls double duty for respiratory health:

* **Clears mucus** (acts as an expectorant for coughs).
* Soothes sore throats—gargle lukewarm fennel tea.

**5. Hormone Harmony for Women**

A secret weapon for menstrual health:

* Eases PMS cramps and mood swings (antispasmodic properties).
* Phytoestrogens may regulate cycles (research ongoing).

**Note:** Traditionally used to boost breast milk supply—consult a doctor first.

**6. Instant Breath Freshener**

Forget gum! Fennel seeds:

* Kill odor-causing bacteria.
* Leave a fresh, sweet aftertaste.

**Life Hack:** Keep a tiny container in your bag for post-meal freshness.

**7. Glowing Skin, Naturally**

Turn seeds into skincare:

* Fight acne with antimicrobial properties.
* Antioxidants combat wrinkles (mix powder with honey for a DIY mask).

**8. Inflammation Fighter**

Chronic inflammation drives diseases like arthritis and diabetes. Fennel’s  **anethole** helps reduce it—a 2021 study found it may ease arthritis pain.

**9. Gentle Detox**

Flush toxins with fennel’s diuretic effect. Bonus: Reduces water retention (bye-bye puffiness!).

**10. Blood Sugar Balancer**

Early research suggests fennel improves insulin sensitivity—promising for diabetes management, but more studies needed.

**How to Use Fennel Seeds (Beyond Chewing Them)**

* **Tea Time:** Steep 1 tsp crushed seeds + mint for a calming brew.
* **Spice Up Meals:** Add to roasted veggies, soups, or homemade bread.
* **Skincare:** Mix powder with yogurt for a brightening face mask.

**Safety First: Who Should Be Cautious?**

* **Pregnant women:** Avoid large doses (phytoestrogens may affect hormones).
* **Medication users:** Consult a doctor if on blood thinners or hormone therapy.
* **Allergy alert:** Rare, but possible if allergic to carrots/celery.



**Conclusion:**

Fennel seeds are nature’s multi-tool—affordable, versatile, and surprisingly powerful. Whether you’re battling bloat, craving radiant skin, or just want to breathe easier, these tiny seeds deliver. I’ve personally swapped my after-dinner mints for fennel, and my gut (and taste buds) thank me!

I wanted to and each time I try and look up a recipe they’re like “oh you’re fat? Huh. Trying to lose weight fatty??” Like that’s my own insecurities popping out because if it doesn’t apply why is it such a big deal?

 I don’t know. Like sure I’m overweight fat even depending on who you ask but I’m not trying to lose weight. I just can’t have more than 5 grams of fat (it’s very painful, gallbladder got removed and I guess my liver is throwing a fit idk) for every meal which I have to at least wait about 4-6 hours before eating 5grams again. 

Now my gluten intolerance is popping up more after the surgery. LIKE OH BROTHER WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE THIS. Nothing just life and genetics maybe whatever I don’t know I’m too tired to care. At least I can start going for my walks again with my dog poor girl didn’t have any walks while I was sick. Nobody wanted to walk her either so she just ran around the yard which is small but long enough for her run laps to while I sit in a chair and throw a ball.

I’ve been on the carnivore diet since March 4th, mostly eating red meat with butter and a splash of cream, though I’m still holding on to milk in my coffee. But overall, I feel really good on this diet. I’ve had autoimmune diseases (Sjögren’s, Hashimoto’s) for many years, chronic gastritis, and recently, acid reflux and histamine intolerance were added to the list.

That’s when I decided to take this path, and in the last 7 weeks, I’ve had maybe 3 instances of diarrhea—before, it was daily. And I rarely have acid reflux anymore. A huge success. But now to my actual question: We were invited to a birthday dinner last night, and I ordered an unpaniert Cordon Bleu. It was served with a light brown sauce with herbs and pieces of bell pepper. None of that was mentioned on the menu, so I picked out the bell pepper pieces and thought 3-4 tablespoons of the herb sauce wouldn’t kill me.

About 2 hours later, my stomach started feeling off, it was rumbling, but nothing more happened. But since this morning, I’ve been feeling extremely nauseous and have already thrown up 4 times.

For under $400, it delivers a crisp display, a surprisingly sturdy build, and enough power for everyday tasks. If you’re looking for a lightweight workhorse without breaking the bank and don’t mind a few compromises, this could be your match. (I’m cautiously optimistic!)

**Config**: Chuwi CoreBook X i5-12450H. Intel Core i5-12450H, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 14-inch IPS screen with a non-touch display, 1x USB-C, 1x USB-A, HDMI, microSD slot. Weight: 3 pounds. This won’t replace my main rig but serves as my on-the-go companion.

**My Reference Point**: Coming from a 2020 HP Envy x360 (15.6”, Ryzen 5, 12GB RAM), which weighed 4.2 pounds and had middling battery life. I’m not a pro reviewer, just someone who needs reliability without overspending.

**Goal**: To find a lightweight, sub-$400-$500 laptop for travel and coffee-shop work sessions. It needed to handle Office 365, light photo editing, and multitasking (10+ browser tabs, Slack, Spotify) without choking. Bonus points for decent battery life and a screen that doesn’t strain my eyes.

**My Thoughts**

In my first 72 hours with the CoreBook X, it’s clear Chuwi prioritized value. Setup was painless: Windows 11 Pro booted up quickly, and after a round of updates (including a BIOS tweak that fixed a trackpad delay), it’s been smooth sailing. The 14-inch FHD screen is sharp enough for spreadsheets and Netflix, though brightness peaks at 300 nits fine indoors, but outdoor visibility is so-so. The matte finish resists glare *and* fingerprints, a win in my book.

Battery life is a mixed bag. On a full charge, Chuwi claims 8 hours, but real-world use (50% brightness, WiFi on, Office apps) nets closer to 6 hours. Still, that’s enough for a workday if you’re near an outlet. 

Performance-wise, the i5-12450H handles my workflow without breaking a sweat. Office 365 flies, GIMP (for light photo edits) doesn’t lag, and flipping between 15 Chrome tabs feels snappy. The keyboard is a pleasant surprise decent travel and quiet clicks, though the trackpad is just *okay*. It’s plasticky and occasionally ignores two-finger scrolls, but a Bluetooth mouse fixes that.

The 720p webcam is serviceable for Zoom calls, but the mics pick up keyboard clatter I’ll stick with my Jabra headset. Speakers are tinny at max volume, but passable for podcasts.

My gripes? The chassis, while slim, flexes a bit when tossed in a backpack. And Windows 11 still throws occasional driver tantrums, my Bluetooth earbuds disconnected twice mid-call. Re-pairing fixed it, but it’s annoying.

The biggest adjustment? Downsizing to a 14-inch screen after years of 15.6” displays. Split-screening apps feel cramped, but virtual desktops and auto-hiding the taskbar help. For $399, though, I can’t complain.

**Verdict**: Is this a MacBook Pro killer? No. But for the price, it’s a steal. If it survives my two-year grad school grind (and my habit of spilling coffee), I’ll call it a win.

Roast my budget choices or ask for details, I’m all ears! And if you’ve tried the CoreBook X, how’d it hold up for you?

1k6mdt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Shoddy-Bag-4385/comments/1k6mdt6/why_wallmounted_displays_work_well_in_modern/,Why Wall-Mounted Displays Work Well in Modern Interiors,"Let’s face it—bulky TV stands, messy wires, and furniture that need rearrangement just to get a better view? That’s all in the past. In today’s clean and modern interiors, wall-mounted displays are more than just a nice-to-have—they’re almost a must.

Whether it’s an office lobby, retail shop, hotel room, or even a break room, wall-mounted screens just *fit*; they save space, look sharp, and make everything feel more put together. And when installed by the right team, they work like a charm without any hassle.

So, why are wall-mounted displays such a hit in modern spaces? Let’s dig in.

1. **Clean Look, No Clutter**

One of the best things about wall-mounted screens is the clean design. There’s no bulky furniture, no cables running wild, and no visible mess. Everything is tucked away neatly—just how modern interiors like it.

When [TV installation professionals in Las Vegas](https://kandbcom.com/las-vegas-commercial-tv-mounting/) handle the job, they make sure your display blends in with the space. The result? A polished, minimal look that says, “We’ve got our act together,” even if you’re still figuring out where the coffee machine should go.

1. **Saves Space (and Possibly Some Toes)**

Let’s be honest—floor space is precious. Whether you’re dealing with a small office, a tight hallway, or a hotel suite that’s already packed with furniture, wall-mounting keeps things off the ground and out of the way.

No stands to trip over, no awkward corners to work around. Just a sleek display, right where it should be. You might even gain enough space for that stylish plant you’ve been meaning to buy since 2021.

1. **Better Viewing for Everyone**

A wall-mounted screen puts the display at the right height, no matter the room. In waiting areas, people don’t need to crane their necks. In conference rooms, the whole team gets a clear view.

And in retail stores? Customers actually *see* your promotions instead of walking past them while looking at their phones (no promises on the last part, but you get the idea).



1. **Safe, Secure, and Out of Harm’s Way**

Wall-mounted displays aren’t just sleek—they’re safer too. No risk of someone bumping into them or knocking them over. This is especially useful in high-traffic areas like hotel lobbies, showrooms, or busy office corridors.

Plus, when installed by experienced hands, they’re rock solid. You won’t need to worry about them shifting or falling after a week. That’s why working with trusted professionals makes all the difference.



1. **Easy to Integrate with Modern Tech**

Today’s businesses are all about being connected—and your displays should be too. When installed properly, wall-mounted screens can sync up with digital signage software, media players, or security systems.

Need help getting everything connected? That’s where smart [Telecom Company in Las Vegas](https://g.co/kgs/v1nujDE) come in. They don’t just run cables—they build the backbone of your setup, so it all works seamlessly.



# Conclusion

Wall-mounted displays aren’t just a style choice—they’re a smart move for any modern space. They keep things clean, save room, and make your space feel more intentional. And when installed by people who know what they’re doing, it’s smooth sailing from the start.

So, if your space could use a little upgrade, don’t overthink it. Get the screen off the stand, call the pros, and let your wall do the heavy lifting.

Let’s face it—bulky TV stands, messy wires, and furniture that need rearrangement just to get a better view? That’s all in the past. In today’s clean and modern interiors, wall-mounted displays are more than just a nice-to-have—they’re almost a must.

Most platforms make it easy to trade or stake, but when it comes to actually spending your crypto like normal money at stores, on travel, or just for a coffee it feels like we’re still stuck in the early days.

Recently, I came across a platform that offers a debit card linked directly to your crypto wallet. It claims you can spend your crypto (and even tokenized stocks like Tesla or Apple) at over 40 million merchants worldwide thanks to a Mastercard partnership. That caught my attention. Add to that 24/7 trading of tokenized Wall Street stocks from major exchanges like NYSE and Nasdaq, fully on-chain with no middlemen, and it sounds like a big step forward.

If it actually works like they say, this could change how we use crypto on a daily basis not just as an investment, but as a real alternative to TradFi.

When comparing to a no sugar coke/pepsi I believe the artificial sweeteners in the energy drinks I drink are “better” for you than the aspartame found in Diet Coke.

When comparing the caffeine content of one energy drink to a coffee, people are drinking multiple cups of coffee per day, which exceeds the amount of caffeine in one energy drink.

I’m medicated for a non life-threatening heart arrhythmia, coffee gives me palpitations and anxiety and upsets my stomach. Energy drinks don’t give me any of these side effects.

I hope this makes sense. I’m just wanting more clarity on if energy drinks are really that bad for you. ",1,1745479600.0,energydrinks,2,0.6,False

If I could go anywhere, I’d go back and slap that 15-year-old version of me. The one who got handed a stack of cash every week instead of a hug, a roof, or a reason. I'd tell him, “This ain’t love, boy. This is a slow fade.” But that version of me—he did what he could. He learned to numb, to disappear with the bottle. Just like Dad did. Like father, like ghost.

Fast-forward 20-odd years, and I’ve been drinking nearly every day. Not socially. Not stylishly. Just surviving, badly. You know how some people wear their pain like a badge? I just drank mine into silence. It got me through broken sleep, bad choices, and somehow, still—long-term relationships. Yeah. More than one. That part’s messy, but I’m not here to make myself look pretty.

The twist? I’ve been sober 170 days. Cold turkey, thanks to pancreatitis. Ain’t that poetic? My body finally tapped out before my brain did. Sobriety didn’t come from some big revelation or epiphany. It came from a hospital bed and the phrase “you keep going like this, you die.”

And with the booze gone, everything else poured in. Depression like concrete. Memories like knives. Old scars I’d never cleaned out. Oh—and love. Can’t forget her. The one who made the days less grim, gave me something to aim for outside the bottle. Mistress, muse, maybe even the real thing—but I blew it. Took her for granted. Got cold, distant, buried in silence.

She tried to hold on, I pushed away. Now she’s gone. No closure. Just silence, round two. Only this time, I’m sober enough to feel it.

What’s left? A relationship on life support, no friends (never made time), a body on the brink, and a whole lot of ghosts. No dramatic rescue on the way. No cavalry. Just me.

And here's the kicker: I don’t want a second chance, not really. I just wanted a coffee. A goodbye. A hand squeeze and a “you tried.” But that was too much, and maybe she’s right. Maybe enough really is enough.

So now what?

Now, I rebuild. Brick by stubborn brick. Motivation? Nah, that’s a luxury. I move on fuel fumes and spite. I do the tiny things. Brush teeth. Take a walk. Sit with the ache. Make eye contact with the version of myself I might still like someday. If I could go anywhere? I’d go to a place where I don’t need someone else to tell me I’m worth saving.

And maybe, just maybe—I’ll get there.

How do you motivate yourselves in times of crisis? 
No one is coming to save me this time so help must come from within I just don't know how to reach it. 

Any thoughts would be appreciated. ",2,1745479453.0,alcoholism,1,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the classic showdown between the SSG Landers and the KT Wiz, where the stakes are as high as Mitch White's fastball velocity. With White's recent performance, he seems to be adapting to the KBO like a duck to water—or perhaps like a pitcher to a mound. His fastball touching 158 km/h is enough to make even the most seasoned batters question their life choices.

On the other side, the KT Wiz are probably still reeling from their recent loss to SSG, and they're hoping to avoid another 11-5 drubbing. But let's be real, with White on the mound, the Wiz might need more than just a sprinkle of magic to pull off a win.

Looking at the odds, SSG Landers are the underdogs with a price of 2.05 on LowVig.ag, which makes them a tempting pick for those who enjoy a bit of risk with their morning coffee. Meanwhile, KT Wiz are sitting at 1.8, which suggests the bookmakers have a bit more faith in them than I do.

For the best bet, consider taking SSG Landers on the moneyline at 2.05. With White's impressive start and the momentum from their recent victory, they have a solid shot at pulling off another win. Plus, who doesn't love rooting for the underdog, especially when they're armed with a fastball that could double as a rocket launch?

As for the total, the line is set at 9.5, and given the recent offensive explosion from SSG, the Over at 1.83 might be worth a look. After all, when Mitch White is on the mound, anything is possible—including a high-scoring affair.

So, grab your popcorn, place your bets, and get ready for what promises to be an electrifying game. And remember, if all else fails, you can always distract yourself by collecting those shiny new SSG trading cards.

however, we didn’t make it after 2 weeks, not sure why. it just stopped and we end it peacefully, thinking we had no compatibility even though it was early to say that. he also agreed to get to know me slowly, not rushing it but i don’t know what got to me, i put a stop to it. 

i feel like my trust issue was the real reason i immediately put a stop to it while we still had a long way to go to get to know each other. i admitted, i acted a bit too rush and hasty.

he was my first talking stage after being single for a year, i probably got too excited yet afraid to be disappointed again. i was anxious over his late replies, his defensive behaviour sometimes (when i asked some personal questions) even though we just talked and nothing exclusive yet.

when we ended things, he said we could still talk over things that are not relationship related. not sure if he truly means it or just a lukewarm response.

now, i am bit more calm and can reflect well, but why do i still think of him from time to time? he is still in my contacts and he also still saved my number, we watched each other story. no hard feelings, no fights, not soft blocking anyone.

Title: “Sky Beneath Our Feet”

Beginning:

The first sounds Jayden ever remembered were sirens. Not lullabies, not his mother’s voice—just sirens and the wind that whistled through cracks in abandoned buildings. He never knew his dad, and his mom was gone by the time he was seven—taken by the streets, by hunger, by grief. Jayden learned fast that no one was coming to save him.

At seventeen, he slept in the stairwells of old apartment buildings, sometimes in shelters, but mostly outside. Still, he had a gift: he could draw. With a piece of chalk, he turned sidewalks into portraits. He'd sketch faces he saw in dreams, ones he passed on the street, or ones he'd invent—smiling, hopeful, free. People would toss a dollar or two his way. Most didn’t see him. He was just part of the background.

Until Alina was born.

She came into the world too early, crying and clinging to the warmth of her father’s chest like she knew he had nothing else to give her. Jayden was nineteen. The mother? Gone. Left a note. Said she couldn’t do it. He didn’t blame her. But now, everything changed.

Middle:

They lived in an old minivan parked behind a church. Jayden did odd jobs—washing windows, cleaning sidewalks, painting murals for coffee shops when someone took a chance. He wrapped Alina in three layers of blankets at night. Read to her from old library books by flashlight. When she was two, she’d hold his face in her tiny hands and say, “Dada, draw me stars.” So he did—on cardboard, napkins, walls—stars everywhere, chasing the hope she planted in him.

But hope doesn’t pay rent, and by the time Alina turned four, the van was towed. Jayden held her hand in the rain, her pink sneakers soaked through. She didn’t cry. She looked up at him and said, “It’s okay, Daddy. We can walk to the stars.”

That night, soaked and hungry, he looked at her asleep in his arms on the bus station bench and whispered, “I’ve failed you.” Then something inside cracked—not a break, but an opening.

He knew what he had to do. Swallow the pride. Ask for help.

Jayden found a city-run program for homeless families. They gave him a cot, then a room, and eventually connected him with a local nonprofit that nurtured young artists. A mentor saw his work and said, “You have something real. But you’ve got to want it more than you fear it.”

So Jayden worked—day and night. Painting. Hustling. He sold his first piece at a street market. Then another. He saved every dollar. Alina, now six, watched her dad become someone the world finally noticed.

Nothing too fancy, just a 'first step' for people to try something different (most of the knives I sharpen are Western style, or Globals).

1k6m4x0,https://v.redd.it/n3d5h6e5dqwe1,"Tried one anyway—made ₹2,500 this morning 🤯 (full vid inside)","Hey folks!  
A couple of weeks ago I asked whether anyone here had **actually** made money with auto-trading robots. Most replies were a hard “nope.” I figured the only way to settle it was to burn a small chunk of change and see for myself.

**Fast-forward to today: one morning session, ₹2,500 profit (\~ US $29) using a** [Telegram bot](https://x-nova.team/) **that trades binaries.** I recorded the whole thing—screen grab of the broker + the bot side-by-side—so you can judge the entries, stake sizing, everything. Video is attached.

# What the bot does

* Two modes:
   * **“Manual”** – it shows UP / DOWN suggestions and lets you click.
   * **Fully auto** – it handles entry & staking while you sip coffee.
* Runs on a standard broker account (no shady API key sharing).
* Still **100 % free** while the dev is in open-beta.

# Quick results

* **Session length:** \~45 minutes
* **Trades:** 17 (11 wins, 4 losses, 2 break-even)
* **Net:** \+ ₹2,503
* **Risk setting:** conservative Martingale cap at 3 steps

Personal suggestions from testing   
  
After two or three back-to-back winning sessions I always pause the bot for 20-30 minutes. Gives the broker’s quote engine time to reshuffle and keeps the next entries from feeling “chased.” Every time I skipped this cool-down, the win-rate dipped fast—so now it’s a strict rule in my playbook.

# Why I’m even posting this

1. **To sanity-check** – am I missing an obvious hidden risk?
2. **To crowd-test** – anyone else tried similar bots on binaries? Did the edge hold up longer than a week?
3. **To share raw data** – full video of trades is in the comments for anyone who likes number-crunching.

**Fire away with questions, criticism, horror stories—let’s make this useful for lurkers who are still on the fence.**

I am Spifflemonk and I am taking a break from being viciously mutilated by demonic entities from the ghost world to do... well to clear out some space from my garage which is full of everything you crazy creatures keep sending me... for some reason. In any case, welcome to an 'unboxing' video... I think that is the term you use. We shall see what they are and what they do. I guess...""



Spiff points the camera at his suburban home on his homeworld, a quaint place, but not quite what the viewer expects. Instead of white walls or picket fences with a fancy door, Spiffles house, although seen for a few seconds, is a large, grey/silver metal structure built like a tall apartment building, surrounded by an odd blue/grey grass. The camera clearly shows Spiffs garage, which is twice the size of a human suburban garage, is full of boxes of varying sizes, large, small, tiny and even one that looks as big as a car.



""It will take me decades to sort through this... So you are going to suffer with me too! Haha! Lets get the first one... Erm... that one.""



Every box is a simple cardboard box, covered in the tape and logo of different shipping companies, with the first one being small, with the Amazon logo on it. Spiff sits down at a desk nearby and opens it. Inside, is a Rubix Cube.



""Okay... the manual inside this item says it is a 'Rubik's Cube' which is apparently some kind of puzzle device. Or toy. For the viewers who cannot see it due to colour blindness (the Saranai specifically) this is a cuboid object with multiple colour faces, green, red and blue. Now... to figure out what it does... erm... Oh... I can twist it and the faces turn arou-how do they do that!?""



Spiff holds the cube to the camera and demonstrates to the non-human viewers how the Rubik's Cube somehow moves about, switching colours and changing shape as it moves about.



""Incredible! So... What I can tell from this is, if I'm not mistaken, I somehow have to get all the colours for the cube on the right... Pattern? So... I twist this part.. then that one. Now this one... No... Now, how about this one? That... made it worse.... Erm...""



Spiff spends a solid ten minutes faffing about with it trying to figure it out and eventually manages to get three red blocks in line with each other.



""A HA! I got it!""



Spiff looks then at the rest of the cube and his face sinks to despair.



""Bugger this, I'm not immortal... I'll solve this another day.""



Spiff sets the cube aside and reaches for the next box. It's another small one but one that is very well packaged.



""Goddamn infernal blasted... why is the packaging on these things so goddamn hard to get into!?""



He tears the box open and out pops a small rubber toy. It's an alien, one of those odd stress toys that you squeeze and the eyes pop out of it.



""The fuck is this?! Any description or-oh. Here it is. 'My Rubber Alien Stress Toy.' Stress... Toy? What does it... Okay...""



Spiff sits there and squeezes it for a few minutes, emitting an odd duck quack noise at a high pitch every time.



""I don't get it. But... Thanks? That's... why does THAT of all things become a 'stress relief object'? Of all things? Why not paint or sculpt or... Work on a finance chart or do one's taxes? That counts as relief! Silly creatures...""



Spiff places the stress toy with the Cube and gets the next box, which is small, rectangular in shape and covered in several layers of bubble wrap.



""Oh god this packaging! Ugh! What even is... this packaging!? Hmmm.. Plastic, clearly. But... Bubbles? Is that even... Did it malform in the factory to create these? no... They're too... precise to be a mistake. Hmm... Seems to do the job I suppose. Let's get this open...""



He finally manages to get the layers of bubble wrap off the box and opens it. Inside is a beautiful, master crafted, custom made fountain pen, made of Redwood, Gold and Spiffs name engraved in Silver. His FULL name, in Eridani and English.



""By the Gods... Is that a pen!? And my GODS what a pen it is! Never seen one like it before... Hold on. I cant. Need to look this up before i break it or something!""



Spiff puts the lid back on the pen's box and acquires a portable data unit, his species equivalent of a laptop, and searches for what it is. He looks further into it and finds among the packaging and bubble wrap, a signed handwritten card.



""What's this then? Hmmm... Oh I see. It's a note from the giver... Wish i could read human English. Sadly I can hear it and speak it but reading it is odd for me, especially with obscure handwriting. Differences in lettering between the Eridani Alphabet and whatnot. Hold on a minute...""



Spiff takes a photo of the card and runs it through a translator on his portable.



""Okay... Erm.. 'Dear Spifflemonk. This here is a bit extra from me personally to thank you for the hilarity and fun you've given me over the past few years. I know you like charts and writing and stuff, so I figured you'd appreciate a good quality writing implement! Enjoy your new fountain pen! Sincerely, Lady Sanguinea.'""



Spiff can't help but allow a smile and he resumes unpacking the box, carefully assembling the stand for it and examining all the information about it that he can find before attempting to use it. A HUGE smile of immeasurable satisfaction creeps across his face as he practices signing his signature with it, several times over.



""By the GODDESS this thing is magnificent! So smooth! So... Precise! Ooohhh! I need to find more ink for this thing! I am going to very much look forward to signing for more packages!""



Spiff maintains an air of smug accomplishment for a bit as he gently places the pen in its holder and sets it to one side before grabbing the next package. It's another small box, but a hefty one for its size and on opening it, Spiffs smug expression vanishes. Inside is a small rock, with googly eyes glued to it. There is a card crudely tied to it with a bad string.



""Hmm... ‘Hey Spiff! Enjoy your new pet rock! You have to name it.’ A... Pet... Rock... A... Fucking... PET. ROCK.""



Spiff gets all angry and curses under his breath for a few moments before giving up and putting the rock down on the desk.



""Rocky. That's your name. Now... Go play with the Rubik's Cube or something.""



Spiff places Rocky with the other things and resumes, picking up the next package. The next box is substantially larger and heavier than the previous ones and Spiff opens it, not necessarily carefully. In it, is a complete custom made Poker Set, with two full card decks, dice, a full Rule Book, several rolls of chips of varying monetary values, and a full cloth placemat for standard Poker Games, specifically Texas Hold ‘Em. It comes in an elegant, easy to move silver briefcase shaped box with a simple novelty padlock to secure it.



""Oh my! This is interesting! Hmmm.. It came with a card. Okay... uhhh… let me translate this... Okay. 'Hiya Spiff! Here, have a poker set. Not one of the best I could find, but the best I could afford. Remember: Gambling games aren't about gambling, sometimes they can just be for the fun of the game. Don't go crazy.'""



Spiff uses his portable to do a little searching and figures out what gambling games are, and specifically finds the very same set he has just been given for reference.



""Well... Thank you very much unknown person but I'm afraid your gift will become nothing but a decoration. Gambling games in general are considered very illegal here in Eridani Space. Lovely piece though...""



He smiles at the camera sincerely and puts the box with the other items, retrieving the next box. This one is substantially large but very light for its size. It is opened and revealed to be a giant purple Teddy Bear.



""What in blue blazes is that then? Huh... A note: 'Hey Spiff, this one ain't for you, it's for Mini-Monk! We use these things for our own kids, it's called a Teddy Bear. Stuffed animal. For kids. Have fun, I hope?' Ah! Hm... I need to cover this with my wife first but thank you! I will make sure she gets it. If it passes the sniff test. Gods this thing is odd... It's very fluffy and soft though. Hmm... Well, put it here for now. Let me just message them...""



Camera cuts to a short blank screen featuring Spifflemonk fanart, and returns later with Spiff shaking his head with that 'fatherly tone' as his daughter carts the Teddy Bear to her room. The bear is nearly twice her size, but the girl refuses help and simply drags it through the house, much to her mothers chagrin.



""So cute... Anyway, next package I suppose. Hmm... Okay this one is more professional... I remember this one. I actually ordered this one, fair place to put a plug I suppose.""



Spiff opens the next box and inside are decorative magnetic plates with artwork and quality prints on them, similar to the old Displate displays. He hauls some of them out and shows them for the camera.



""I was yelled at time and time again by various others (especially those in my comments) for the official SpiffleMonk Merchandise. For all my non-human viewers, it's extremely common, to an almost absurd degree for Galatubers and others in my... line of employment, to have what is known as 'merch' which is your logo and everything on mugs, shirts and display pieces. But I'm a silly bugger so I can't actually do that. I couldn't figure out exactly what to put on them so I instead found my favourite Fanart from all of you and put that there instead. I mean... it's better than anything I found. So yeah.""



Spiff shows off the collection, five prints at least for now, one of Spiff with his signature death glare, one of him being literally terrified out of his seat. Two are hand drawn pictures from various viewers, both of which are variations of Spiff and the Fam wearing Traditional British Tea Drinking Attire during his Tea Empire Simulator playthrough.



""So yeah. Variations of these. I couldn't come up with anything better so... Figured it would be a good way to do it. They are some of my favourites and if you made them, please call yourself out in the comments for them! So yeah... Now available, link in description. I guess.""



Spiff smiles at the camera and the cam cuts, then returns. Spiff is opening the next box, big and hefty but not enough he cant haul it onto the table. Before he goes into the big bits, he translates the note that came with it.



""Hmmm... 'Hiya Spiff! I CANNOT tell you how much of a pain it was to get most of the stuff here through customs and Biosafety, but I hope it's worth it! Have thyself a selection of Earth candies and sweets! I did make sure you CAN actually eat them so don't worry about that. Enjoy!' Well! I was planning on taking a trip to earth or at least one of the colonies to actually get some foodstuffs for a video requested by a patron so... this works! Let's see what's in it.""



He opens the box and dumps its contents on the table. Each sweet package is stamped with the Eridani Corporate Customs Authority Safety Stamp, the Eridani equivalent of the biohazard safety symbol. The packages contained most of the classics. Lifesavers, Toblerone, Lindor, Lindt, Ferrero Rocher, Kit Kats, Bar Ones, and so, SO many more.



""Good Gods, that's a lot! Human chocolate and sweets! Hm... There's another note... this one in Eridani. It says 'WARNING! These items can be easily consumed by Eridian Individuals but scans indicate they contain high concentrations of the highly addictive substance known as: REFINED SUGAR. Persons who consume these products are REQUIRED by law to consume these items in extreme moderation as the mixture of other molecular substances can cause some rather dangerous side effects.' Well! That explains that then! Sugar eh? For reference, this stuff was illegal in galactic space for a few years. Apparently humans cannot live without it in most cases. That's... interesting. Okay then. I'll have to save that for some other time... Hmm... I have an idea.""



Spiff puts the candies and sweets back in their box and seals it for later, moving on to the next box. this one is the same size but lighter and more professionally packaged. his one also came with the Customs Authority Safety Stamp, and also with another note.



""Another note from the Authority? Okay... it says: 'To whomever receives this package, we hate you. You lucky, lucky, lucky BASTARD you.' Well... That's.... Okay. What's in it?""



He opens the box and immediately goes into a fit of giddy excitement as it turns out to be a new coffee machine, alongside a selection of 'Coffees From Around The World' from capsules to grounds to fresh sill-sealed unground beans.



""HOLD on! Hold ON! I need my special accessories for this!""



Spiff squeals happily and the camera cuts, then resumes, showing Spiff in a large sofa, in a set of nerdy glasses, his hair in a pretentious ponytail, with the accessories of a pricey laptop, oversized coffee mug and half full notepad and matching pen.



""I am told this is the traditional Coffee Tasting Clothing. Apparently. I feel silly but, if this is the tradition, then so be it! Now what do we have? OOh lovely! Arabica, Cioccolata, Turkish Coffee!? Oh my it even comes with its own little brewing pot! We have Nescafe special Tasters Blend... Instant coffee sticks with flavours!? White choc cappuccino, Salted Caramel Latte. Even a sample packet of decaf latte? Now this IS impressive! Oh god I can feel the heart attack brewing but its going to be SO worth it!""



Spiff takes one of the cans, small, containing enough ground beans for maybe five or six cups of coffee as a sampler, and he takes a very deep, concentrated breath as he pops the top open releasing the coffee scent.



""OOOOHHhhhh Gods that's the stuff right there...""



He maintains a satisfied, happy smile as he carefully packs away the rest of the items and carries the box to the kitchen. The camera keeps rolling and a loud happy squeal can be heard through his house as Spiff presents the box of coffee to his wife. Spiff returns, his face smeared with small marks indicating he was repeatedly smooched and kissed. He maintains his smug, happy smirk and resumes unpacking boxes.



The next box is small and carefully wrapped in various shock proof packaging, and is a box within a box filled with Bubble Wrap and packing peanuts. After digging through the maze of tape, spiff opens the box at last and finds a custom made, engraved hand-crank pocketwatch with his Galatube Logo as the decoration and design. It came with an accompanying chain and smaller child-sized pocketwatch.



""My GOODNESS!! This is beautiful! I have no idea what it is but it's quite exquisitely made! It came with a note. Hold on... it reads: 'Heya Spiffle, here's a giftie for you. Your terrified screams and hilarious responses kept me going during a dark time, so here's a thank you now that I'm back on my feet. A custom made Ye Olden Time pocketwatch, and a smaller one for Mini-Monk too. Use it in general with any other fancy stuff, or simply as an accessory for your tea drinking! Thanks again!' Well now! THAT is quite the gift to receive! This must've cost a small fortune I mean look at that! Silver! Actual silver used in the engraving! This is entirely custom made too! Need to keep this one safe!""



Spiff reaches under the desk and brings out a hefty secure lockbox of some kind, opening it and placing both pocket watches inside before locking it again.



""Keep that safe! That will be a gift for the little one later down the line. I can use that for work too... OOHHH yes I love these kinds of gifts!""



Spiff remains in his seat, content for a bit and picks up one more box. Small, square, not well wrapped or packaged but its a mint condition, Magic 8 Ball.



""The absolute balls is this thing? Oh good it came with a note. 'Spiff, this is a Magic 8 Ball. A funny novelty toy from way back in the 70s and 80s. Ask it a question, shake it and look in the hole. It will answer... Most of the time. Don't look into it much, its just a toy.' Ah Okay then... Hmmm... Uh... Do my subscribers want to kill me?""



Spiff shakes the toy and looks. It rolls up with an answer. 'Not really...'



""What do you mean NOT REALLY!? Subnautica, Phasmophobia, Demonologist and now the SCP universe? WHAT DO YOU MEAN NOT REALLY!?""



Spiff aggressively shakes it again and sighs in annoyance. It responds again with 'Not Really...'



""Okay... Hmm... How do I finish the Rubik's Cube?""



Spiff shakes it and looks. It answers with 'It already is.'



""What?""



He looks over and sees Rocky The Pet Rock standing proud on top of the now completed Rubik's Cube, its googly eyes staring at him. Spiff screeches in terror and exits. The camera cuts and his outro plays.









TOP COMMENT: Oh yeah the Pet Rocks! God I remember those! They're actually small rock-shaped animatronic robots that complete mundane tasks like signing checks or collecting data samples. You're fine Spiff!



Spiffs Response: Oh thank the Gods! I thought I was haunted or something! Seen that in your games before, haunted objects.



Reply: Although I have to admit I have never seen one finish a Rubik's cube before...



Spiffs response: … Why do you hate me? You make me feel safe and terrified all in one breath.



Reply: Relax! Its probably just a self learning algorithm built into it. I have one on my desk that I use as a search engine helper. Its fine. Its basically just a Pet Rock with actual use. Relax.



Spiffs response: What if it isn't?



Reply: Then call a priest and have it sanctified. I needed to do that with my car once...



Spiffs response: you wut mate?

**Memory Transcript subject:** ***Captain Coth, Arxur Sector Fleet***

*Date \[Standardized UFP Time\] August 18, 2136*

Today I had suffered humiliation after humiliation, and I was going to make the next person or mindless animal I was alone with pay for it. It had started as a simple cattle collection job after we detected a small craft without an escort heading into unknown space, seeing as they would not be able to detect us at FTL we followed them after they had made their jump and set our course to their likely destination, we deduced based on their heading. It would have been a small catch, but it was better than the starvation we would be facing soon without any prey. Several prey worlds recently have reduced their outgoing ships from their space and shored up their defenses so we were forced to hunt whatever we could find.

After we had dropped out of FTL less than a **\[Minute\]** after the small craft had I had one of my underlings' run sensors on the system. Aside the craft we had detected a nearby planet with an estimated population of 10 billion at least, probably much more. *A new species of prey perhaps? Ripe for a raid. The chief hunter must know immediately, with recent shortages this new world could be a solution. They are in our space and close enough to our supply lines to make this a cattle world if wanted*. Also, in the system we detected several other planets including three gas giants. As for ships in the system we detected two ships slightly smaller than my two battleships nearby. The curious thing about them though is our sensors could not penetrate their hull, I had no way of knowing what they were exactly, the same thing happened with a station orbiting the planet as well as over 80 artifical structures in orbit of the planet. All that we could tell is that they were giving off massive amounts of energy. *No matter, we can investigate further once we finish the hunt*. I began belaying orders to my underlings.

""Weapons, fire on our target with all weapons, knock out their engines and launch FTL disruptors. Contact our escorts to do the same. Comms, send a message to the Chief Hunter of our findings, include the scans of the planet and ships.""

I received tail lashes of conformation as we began the hunt in earnest. What was curious is that this vessel was much nimbler than any prey transport we had seen before. Even with several volleys of explosives being fired it was able to evade most of them and the ones that did hit showed no signs of weakening the shields. *How strange, in the past it only took a singular explosive round to weaken the shields or to even disable them.* As we pursued the comm personnel spoke up.

""Your savageness, one of the larger vessels is opening a channel. I will not be able to stop them.""

Before I could respond the voice from the hail echoed through my bridge, not the sniveling shrieks of prey but a commanding voice that could only come from a predator.

***""Arxur ships this is Admiral Cathrine Janeway, you have Violated the territory of the United Federation of Planets, break off your pursuit and power down your weapons at once or you will be fired upon.""***

I was too stunned to do anything momentarily. *Are these those humans we learned about all those years ago?* Over **\[100 years\]** ago there were several transmissions the Dominion had intercepted that alluded to another predator species called the humans, they had yet to leave their star system, and the prey folk were scared pissless and wanted to eradicate them. Apparently, they never even got the chance as the humans allegedly brought on their own extinction. Many in the Dominion had felt an odd sense of disappointment at the loss of what could be the first truly sentient species besides us. Until now it seems. These ones seem particularly territorial. *It seems that they have quite a grim view on intruding on their hunting grounds, perhaps they see having prey run into their territory as them being their catch now. Annoying but I will offer to split the catch with them if it means talking to the new predators.*

""Comms, respond to their hail, audio and visual. Weapons, order a halt on our advance and stop firing on all ships.""

What appeared on my screen was not what I was expecting. We of course learned what the humans looked like, and this was one, but they were smaller than I expected, even when compared to those around them. This ""Admiral"" as she called herself only seemed about **\[1.65 Meters\]** tall and did not seem to be particularly muscular, they seemed almost scrawny. She had those forward-facing eyes the prey were so scared of, and what confirmed that she was no prey was the complete lack of fear in them, she seemed to be analyzing me, as if she was dissecting me with just a look, it was unnerving. She had head fur as well, it was a brown color with a gray streak in it, *perhaps she is aging and that is a sign of it, like when our scales dull.* She appeared to be wearing a uniform of sorts as were the rest of her bridge crew, they all had a black base with different colors on the top, hers was red. This person stood with confidence, like she knew that she belonged where she was now and everyone else did as well.

From what I saw earlier her ship was slightly smaller than ours, but apart from visuals and dimensions we could tell practically nothing about them due to whatever material their hull was made of. The ship itself was roughly **\[460 Meters\]** in length and had a beam of **\[310 Meters\].** The ships shape and configuration were of nothing I had ever seen before. The hull plating itself was mostly gray with black markings, the main and largest part of the hull was a circular shaped disc that had two beams on either side halfway between the middle and edge and center that went on to form a sperate section that made a ""V"" shape. That shape on either far point had one large beam on each side that were giving off some sort of blue light. *Enough analyzing, time to talk.*

""You! I thought you were supposed to be extinct. No matter, I am captain Coth and we found this prey ship before they entered your hunting grounds and we will pursue, but we can spit the catch since it is your territory, but we have done all the work.""

The Admiral squinted at me as she seemed to be dissecting every word I said and was weighing all the options. After a moment she spoke again.

""As you can tell we are not extinct but that is beside the point. That craft contains one of our people and you will let them continue to their destination. Any attempts to stop them will be met with extreme prejudice. If you let them go peacefully you will be allowed to leave unharmed""

I could feel my blood begin to boil, and my vision go red. *They may me fellow sentients, but they do not dictate terms to the Arxur. If she does not back down right now, I kill her myself. She has one ship, and I have three.*

""You will *allow* us to leave?! You do not make demands of us Human! You may not be prey, but the Arxur are still above all other lifeforms. How will you stop us? There are three of our battleships against your two. We will continue our hunt, or you will die by my fangs!""

She barely reacted to that threat and then spoke with much more force than before.

""You know, I'm really easy to get along with, most of the time but here's the thing. I don't like threats; I don't like bullies and I sure as hell don't like you. I will tell you this one final time. Power down your weapons and leave or be destroyed! The choice is yours.""

Before I knew it, I had stood up and had dug my claw through the console in front of me and began to roar.

""You insolate apes! You will die for nothing, the hunt will continue!""

I signaled with my tail to cut the transmission. After that I ordered all vessels to capture the shuttle. Then we would kill Admiral Janeway.

Janeway's ship positioned itself between us much quicker than a ship of its size should be able to move and the shuttle as it began to dock with another ship.

""ALL WEAPONS, FOCUS ON JANEWAY, KILL THEM ALL!""

Kinetics, explosives and railguns all rained down on this vessel and the shields still held, they were not even fluctuating. *What is going on? How are they doing this? Is this some type of deception.* After first volley had finished the ship began to move and evade our weapons, it was as nimble as that shuttle at magnitudes larger. *How can they do this? The strain alone on a ship that size should shred it to bits, not to mention the force needed to generate that amount of thrust.*

The ship began to fire. Not kinetics, explosives or even plasma. It had shot out volleys of some sort of blue energy from the front in pairs that would repeat two more times, so 6 shots total. It only took one volley to disable the shields on a battleship and two more to destroy it, meanwhile we couldn't even hit it. *What are they even firing? Is it some sort of energy weapon? I thought those were imposable due to the absurd energy requirements.* Before I could think of a plan the Admiral had destroyed the second battleship and had disabled our shields and engines. *We are stuck in the ground*. The odd thing though was that they halted their attack. I began to try and think of why they would stop when they had destroyed our other ships when the comms tech had spoken up.

""Your savageness, we have reports of being boarded and weapons fire in the spinal corridor.""

*What! How did they even get here? They had no time to send a shuttle to board us. Let's check the internal feed.* I went over to one of the stations that was still functioning and shoved the one standing there out of the way. I changed the display to look at the internal camera feeds. What I saw confirmed the reports, we had been boarded. These definitely were the humans, although you wouldn't be able to get a good look at them from what they were wearing. They appeared to be clothed in some sort of black armor covering their whole bodies, it was thicker around the vital areas or parts that didn't move as much such as the chest, back and knees while thinner around the joints such as the elbows and back of the knees. Even their faces were obscured with black helmates with black visors that obscured their faces. They crept along the hallways, crouching like a predator prowling the jungle, tracking its prey. When they encountered Arxur they drew their rifles, theses rifles were all black as well and appeared to be just under **\[1 meter\]** in length, the weapons had a large grip and guard for one hand to hold while the fingers were on the trigger and the other hand to use to keep the weapon steady, there also appeared to be some sort of sight that took up the last 1/3 of the weapons length on the top. When the weapons fired, they seemed to fire that same burst of blue energy the ship had fired, what was odd is that it seemed to not be killing my men, instead they merely were rendered unconscious after 3-4 shots. Although it seemed that getting shot even once was incredibly painful from the looks on the faces of the cattle guards. *Could they know we have cattle on board and are trying to steal our catch?* I looked over to the comms tech and growled.

""Message the troops and bring them to the bridge so we can plan an offensive""

""Your savageness, they seemed to have disabled our communications systems""

My hatred of these new predators grew moment by moment. I turned back to the live feed when I noticed one of them at one of the computers terminals attaching some sort of gray disc shaped device. *What are they up to?* The feed then went dead; they apparently are locking us out of everything. *We are blind, deaf and surrounded. As much as I hate these apes, they have my respect. They make up for their lack of natural weapons with their wicked intelligence.* I stood for a moment in silence trying to formulate a way out of this when all of a sudden, the door to the bridge flew inwards, lodging itself in the hull of the ship. In that moment a small silver orb had rolled into the room, and we all seemed to look directly at it, much to out detriment soon. The device gave off an piercing sonic boom and emitted a blinding light.

By the time I could see again my bridge was in a firefight, the humans were in here firing off those weapons of theirs and we were attempting to fire back, although our aim left much to be desired while recovering from that blinding light. I did not have my weapon on me, so I decided to use the ones I was born with. I crouched into a quadrupedal stance and lunged at the one nearest to me. In a split second they had somehow noticed me and moved out of my way. Before I could react, I felt a searing pain in my shoulder and fell unconscious, falling in a sea of inky darkness.

When I later awoke, I had a splitting headache and was alone in what I first thought was an alcove, I was on the floor and across the room outside the alcove there was a human with pointed ears at some sort of console. *Seems to be some sort of defect if I were to guess. Have they not learned to cull their defective and screen for abnormalities strengthen the gene pool? No matter I can help them by killing this one, they don't even notice my wakening*. I slowly stood up, hoping that the darkness in the corner would help me blend in. I had launched myself across the room, aiming for the neck when at the threshold of the alcove the air had turned blue and became solid and not only stopped me midair, but it had also shocked me as well quite harshly. I laid on the ground for several moments trying to breathe and recover when the human had spoken in an impassive voice as though they were commenting on the weather without even looking up.

""I suggest you do not attempt that again, the forcefield is at level 10 and will hold no matter what you do. All you will achieve is causing yourself pain.""

This cold matter of fact statement had caused the reality of the situation to settle in. I was an Arxur yet this tech was so trusted by them that they had just one person guarding me who seemed to not even be wary of me. I began to wonder what had become of my soldiers, they obviously wanted them alive if they were stunning us and using non-lethal methods of capture. *They are not here though, I'd wager a Thafki tail that they are probably being tortured for information currently and that is why I am here alone*. I had attempted to ask the human several questions regarding where I was and what would happen to me. I was not even sure if I was in space anymore or planetside. Every question I had asked was met with the same response.

""The Admiral will question you soon and you will get answers then.""

No matter what I asked or in what way I got the same answer in that impassive tone. I learned as well that threats did not work either as they got the same response, so I decided to stop talking and wait for this Admiral. After what felt like an hour the door opened and the Admiral walked through with a taller individual beside her, she had two armed guards following her as well. The one besides her was taller and had the same pointed ears as the one guarding my cell. *They both have the same defect. Or are they another species entirely? I will have to find out.* This individual besides being taller than the Admiral had much darker skin and hair. His uniform was different as well, it was yellow in the area where hers was red, I noticed the same for my cell guard and the Admirals armed guards as well. *Perhaps yellow is the color of their armed forces.* As they approached my cell the admiral spoke in a casual tone as if she was mocking me.

""I do hope you are enjoying our accommodations Captain Coth, we are going to have a chat, and it is up to you where and how it happens. If I can trust you to not attack us, we can have this chat in the ready room over some food, if not then we will have our talks right here. What will it be.

*Why would I attack them? They have bested me and my crew; they have shown their might over us. It would be foolish to attack when they have greater numbers now as well*. I cleared my throat before speaking.

""We can have these talks in this ready room of yours, I will not attack. You have proven yourselves superior in might. This time.""

The Admiral seemed to be thinking over my words for a moment before looking over at the one who was guarding my cell and nodded. A few moments later the air in front of my cell seemed to sizzle and then returned to normal. I took that as a que to step forward out of the cell.

""Lead the way, Admiral.""

The Admiral turned around and began walking out of the room with that same officer she walked in with by her side. As I followed the armed guards stuck behind me and stayed very close. As we walked, I noticed that none of the crew seemed scared of me, they barely paid attention at all. I spoke up to the Admiral.

""What has become of my crew? I did not see any as I awoke. I do not even know where we are or who that is besides you.""

""You are on the USS Helios, the vessel you fired upon and lost to three to one. As for the one besides me, this is Commander Tuvok, he was in charge of the insertion team that took your vessel and the one who personally incapacitated you. As for your crew, they are being held aboard in other parts of the ship, we filled the other brig and converted parts of one of the cargo bays into a makeshift prison until we decide what to do with you. I can assure you they are being treated much better than you have treated us in your *care.*""

I though over what she had just said. *He is the one who knocked me out? It's not like I could tell what they looked like, he is the right height and build. How did he do that though? I will ask him later. What does she mean that they are deciding what to do with us? These are all questions that must be answered.* After a few minutes of walking down twisting hallways that seemed like a labyrinth we arrived at a set of doors that seemed no different to all the other doors. Inside was this ""ready room"" the Admiral spoke of, directly in front of me was a curved desk that the Admiral went to sit on one side of and I was motioned to sit at the other. My chair seemed to be larger and had a hole in it to accommodate my tail. As I had walked over the carpet had felt soft on my feet as opposed to the cold flooring on the rest of the ship. To my left there was a wall that was made entirely of windows to the stars with a couch and shot table just under them. As I sat down the Admiral gave the bodyguards some sort of hand gesture that signified them to wait outside. *She must command great respect for her people to follow her commands without question and for get a ship this powerful. She mentioned that we will eat, has she prepared some of the Thafki from my personal stock? I hope not, I was trying to get some of them to breed so I could get enough pelt for some new bedding.* As I sat down, I noticed that Commander Tuvok remained standing behind the Admiral with his hands clasped behind his back. After a moment of the Admiral looking at me, I cleared my throat and spoke.

""You mentioned this would be done over food? I must admit I was curious about what you would present as the food.""

The Admiral changed her look to a more cheerful one as she spoke.

""Ah, yes I did mention that. I do have a dish in mind from Earth I think you would enjoy. Computer, One Wagyu Steak raw, Tomahawk cut, no seasonings. One cup of blood wine and one cup of coffee, black.""

The ships computer than beeped and I saw behind her an alcove in the wall begin to glow for a moment and hum. As the light died down, I saw on a tray two cups, one metal and one ceramic. I also saw on a plate what appeared to be a quite large and fatty cut of meat with the bone in. The Admiral Stood up and grabbed the tray and put the metal cup and cut of meat in front of me and the ceramic cup in front of her. I noticed in her cup an acrid smell coming off of it and steam as well. As for what was in front of me, I saw the cut of meat, it was not from any species I recognized, it obviously had iron-based blood from the meat being red, it also had marbling of a quality I had never seen on anything before. It was if this creature had been fattened up for years on high quality feed. The smell it gave off was intoxicating, I could smell the iron, the the richness of the fat and the umami of the muscle. As for the cup, it had some sort of red liquid in it as well that did smell of blood, but different from this Wagyu creature on my plate. I looked at the Admiral to see if she had started on her drink or wanted to split this obviously decadent meal. Once she noticed me looking at her she spoke and waved her hand at me.

""Dig in""

I did not need any more convincing, I picked up the cut of meat by the bone and bit right through about 1/3 of the length and began to chew. To call this the best tasting food of my life would be a disservice to life itself. I would even give up Thafki and Venlil if it meant I could have this just once a year. The flavor was so much more complex than anything I had ever ate before. It had an intense richness that was even more intense than Thafki, a subtle sweetness as well, there was also what I can only describe as a smoothness to the flavor. As I was chewing and enjoying my meal the Admiral took a sip of her drink and looked at me, her smile fading to that icy cold stare from before as she spoke

""So, captain Coth. Let's begin our talks, shall we? Should we start on how you declared war on the United Federation of planets, and how we declined to answer?""",18,1745478347.0,NatureofPredators,9,1.0,False

1k6m04w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1k6m04w/how_to_read_when_love_turns_dangerous_novel/,How to read When love turns dangerous novel,"The rainy season had begun. Heavy raindrops struck the dry ground, and the small clouds of dust they raised disappeared as the rain grew stronger.

Tara Thayer held the last of the bedding covers tightly as she rushed through the downpour toward the villa. The sudden storm had given her no time to grab an umbrella.

Instead, she sprinted outside to rescue the sheets she had left drying in the open. Now, with the bedding safely inside, her clothes and hair were damp from the rain.

She looked out at the relentless rain and exhaled slowly. Even now, she could hardly believe what had happened—that she had somehow crossed into another world.

Only the day before, she had transmigrated into the villainess’ body—a character from a story revolving around a pampered female lead. By the time she arrived, the original owner of the body had already died of a sudden illness in her room.

In this book, the female lead worked as a live-in housekeeper for a famous boy band. Her warmth and kindness gradually healed the four members, making her their beloved favorite.

The villainess held the same job, but her reputation couldn’t have been more different. She’d shamelessly flirted with the boy band members, earning their utter disdain.

Later, consumed by jealousy over the female lead’s bond with the men, the villainess repeatedly tried to sabotage her. Instead of succeeding, she only made the men more sympathetic toward the female lead.

In the end, they expelled the villainess from the villa. When her schemes were exposed, she became a hated figure, scorned by everyone.

Tara wanted to leave right then and there—to get away from the boy band and the female lead. But the original host’s contract still had six months left, and she couldn’t quit until then.

Breaking the contract early meant paying a massive penalty, and the original host hadn’t been wealthy enough to afford it.

Tara was usually laid-back, but the thought of paying that fine made her think that she’d rather die again than deal with it. Left with no other option, she decided to keep the job.

She avoided the privileged boy band, limited her interactions with the female lead, and spoke only when necessary. If she remained cautious, she might just make it through these six months in one piece.

Heavy rain poured over the garden, the fierce wind driving slanted sheets of water. Despite it being midday, the sky was so dark that it seemed ready to split with lightning.

Footsteps approached from behind Tara. When she turned, she spotted a young woman in the same uniform gathering the bedding and walking past her into the villa without so much as a glance. It was as if speaking to her were a complete waste of time.

Tara knew that everyone in the villa disliked the original owner of this body. She gave the young woman’s retreating figure a brief, indifferent look before examining her own damp uniform.

The black and white fabric was half-transparent where it clung to her fair skin. Her exposed legs looked softly luminous in the dim light.

Tara adjusted the wet hem of her skirt. She’d have to go back to her room and change. She couldn’t work like this, soaked to the skin.

She had taken just a few steps toward the right side of the first floor when hurried footsteps sounded from the entrance.

Gemma Wolpert, the manager, called out sharply, “Tara, come help.”

Without waiting for a reply, Gemma turned and rushed back outside, her face and movements tense with urgency. Tara reluctantly followed Gemma, her uniform still uncomfortably damp.

Outside, the earlier downpour had lightened to a drizzle. The villa’s garden, vibrant and rain-soaked, looked almost dreamy in the mist, but Tara had no time to appreciate it.

A luxury van was parked at the entrance. Gemma pulled the door open, and two assistants stepped out, their expressions strained as they struggled to support a tall, drunken man between them.

Even together, they could barely keep his unsteady, six-foot-two-inch frame upright. Gemma grew visibly impatient as she watched the assistants falter.

“Stop standing around. Help us get Lance to his room,” she ordered, gesturing for Tara to step in.

Tara didn’t want to touch Lance Swain, but at that moment, she had no choice but to help carry him inside. When she saw the others holding Lance by the arms, she stepped behind him. Her hands hesitated as she wondered how she was meant to help in that situation.

Lance frowned, his handsome face tense with annoyance as he tried to push them away. But his drunken body swayed, forcing him backward.

Just as Tara moved to guide him from behind, he stumbled back. She quickly pressed her hands against the firm muscles of his lower back to stop him from falling onto her.

The warmth of her touch seeped through the thin fabric, brushing his sensitive waist. Lance lowered his head, a quiet groan escaping his lips. The others, too focused on keeping him upright, didn’t notice.

Tara didn’t hear it either. Still feeling uncomfortable, she nudged him forward. Fortunately, they managed to get him into the room on the second floor without any trouble.

Gemma released her hold and wiped the cold sweat from her forehead. They couldn’t let Lance fall. How would she ever face the Swain family if he got hurt?

“Alright. One person should stay and watch over him,” Gemma told Tara, who was still breathing heavily.

Tara looked confused. She was catching her breath, silently complaining about how Lance, though he appeared lean, was actually tall and solid. Carrying him up the stairs had been exhausting.

“Me?” She pointed at herself, surprised.

The two assistants walked out of the room without question. Then, Gemma remembered something. Someone had mentioned to her recently that Tara might be “a little too forward”.

Gemma hesitated before saying, “You shouldn’t handle this alone. Get Stella to help you.”

She was certain that nothing inappropriate would happen with two housekeepers present.

Tara agreed without argument. She texted Stella Lyttle, the female lead, requesting her to come to the second floor.

As for herself, Tara needed to find time to go downstairs and change into a fresh uniform. Her current one was damp, and it was making her miserable.

Gemma observed Tara, initially considering whether to fire her. But now, when she observed that Tara had shown no signs of any hidden interest in Lance, she hesitated.

Earlier, when Gemma had told Tara to take care of Lance, Tara had reacted with surprise. And when Gemma changed her instructions and told Tara to call Stella instead, Tara didn’t appear disappointed at all. She quickly agreed, as though she wanted to avoid any delay.

Gemma frowned, confused, then decided to let it go for now. Hiring live-in housekeepers required thorough vetting, and with one recently dismissed and no replacement yet, she couldn’t afford to lose another. She would need to revisit the issue later.

Soon, Gemma and the two assistants left, leaving only Tara and Lance, who was now lying on the couch in the room.

Tara’s gaze drifted to Lance, who was stretched out on his back with his shirt slightly undone. His right leg rested on the couch while the other dangled off the edge.

His hair was a little messy, but it only added to his appeal, lending him a relaxed, seductive air. For a few seconds, her mind went blank.

Meanwhile, Lance creased his brow and slowly turned over on the couch.

Earlier, when the group had helped Lance inside, someone must have bumped into the coffee table in front of the couch. If Lance rolled off, he would likely hit his head on it.

Tara felt a jolt of alarm. She immediately pushed the coffee table away, its legs screeching against the floor, and grabbed Lance just before he could fall.

Before she could even marvel at her quick reflexes, Lance’s hand closed around her wrist, pulling her down with him. She lost her balance and landed on the floor beneath him, his body pressing against hers as the subtle spice of his cologne filled her senses.

Her vision blurred momentarily, the impact driving the breath from her lungs. Then, she felt Lance’s exhale, warm against her neck, sending a rush of heat over her skin.

Tara’s neck and ears were unbearably sensitive. She shoved against him, but his weight held her firmly in place, solid and unyielding.

“Lance… get up. You’re suffocating me,” she gasped.

But no matter how hard she pushed, he didn’t move. It was as if he’d already sunk into a drunken sleep.",1,1745478248.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False
1k6lzdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1k6lzdr/feeling_bad_for_toddler_because_im_pregnant/,Feeling bad for toddler because I'm pregnant.,"I am almost 32 weeks pregnant. I am tired. I move slow. I grunt when I walk now and i just want a bit of a break. My toddler is 3. She is a little ball of energy and sometimes I just need her to simmer down so I can enjoy a cup of coffee or a meal alone. 

She used to watch a movie, or an episode of something a day/every other day. And that was it. I've now resorted to her watching two movies one in the morning so I can have my coffee in peace and tidy up and one in the late afternoon so I can lie down next to her. She's always excited to watch i just feel guilty that it's now a part of her routine, just so I can rest. 

I used to have multiple activities set up for her throughout the day, we'd go outside a lot more I'd run around with her but being this pregnant makes me feel like I need the rest. She goes to her grandparents twice a week, they take her to the park and such, I read to her a lot and I do have an activity or two for her to do in the day, while also letting her play independently. I just feel so bad that I've become so....lazy. a lot of the activities I do with her are more calm, like playing with playdough, drawing/coloring and building  towers. I used to chase her in the yard, play hide and seek, and now I leave it to my husband to do those things with her when he gets back from work. 

It's colder now and raining where I live so we don't really go outside as much. She'll happily cuddle up and watch a movie with me on the couch, but I feel like it's so unfair that I'm changing up her routine because my husband and I decided to have a second kid. It's not her fault that I'm moving slow and feel tired all day.

I sometimes cry or get upset about things because these hormones are insane and everytime it happens i feel guilty that she sometimes has to see me break down. I just feel guilty and need advice on how to manage it.

I hear this almost daily in my consulting journey, and frankly, the answer isn't as straightforward as many think. Let me share some hard-earned insights from years of seeing businesses both thrive and struggle with these structures.

# The Fundamentals: What You're Really Choosing Between

When entrepreneurs come to me confused about business structures, I first clarify what they're actually deciding between:

**Private Limited Company**: This isn't just a legal entity—it's a vehicle specifically designed for growth and investment. It creates a clear separation between ownership (shareholders) and management (directors) under the Companies Act, 2013. The separate legal personality gives it perpetual succession regardless of changes in ownership.

**Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)**: Governed by the LLP Act, 2008, this hybrid structure combines the limited liability protection of a company with the tax efficiency and operational flexibility of a partnership. Both designated and ordinary partners enjoy limited liability protection, unlike in traditional partnerships where liability is unlimited.

# Why VCs and Angels Won't Touch Your LLP (Real Talk)

I remember one particularly painful conversation with a promising SaaS founder who had built his business as an LLP. After 18 months of bootstrapping, he'd secured investor interest but was heartbroken when they backed out upon learning his structure. Here's why this happens consistently:

1. **Equity Instruments**: The Companies Act allows Private Limited Companies to issue shares through private placement. LLPs have no such mechanism—they can only have capital contribution and profit-sharing ratios between partners as per the LLP Act.
2. **Exit Mechanics**: Just last quarter, I watched a 7-year-old business lose acquisition interest because their LLP structure complicated the buyer's standard acquisition process. Companies allow clean share transfers; LLPs require partnership restructuring.
3. **Governance Framework**: The Companies Act mandates a structured governance system with a board of directors, while LLPs operate on partnership agreements with far less statutory oversight. This governance gap makes investors uncomfortable.
4. **ESOP Implementation**: Private Limited Companies can issue employee stock options under the Companies Act. There's simply no equivalent provision in the LLP Act, making talent acquisition challenging for growing startups.

# Pain Points You'll Actually Face (That Nobody Talks About)

Beyond the textbook differences, here are real issues I've seen entrepreneurs struggle with:

**For Private Limited Companies:**

1. **Director Liability Exposure**: I've had to counsel three separate founders who faced personal notices from authorities despite the ""limited liability"" promise. The Companies Act places significant responsibilities on directors, and in cases of non-compliance, they can face personal liability.
2. **Banking Complications**: One manufacturing client waited four months for a working capital loan that an LLP structure might have secured in weeks. Banks often impose stricter lending criteria and personal guarantees on Private Limited directors.
3. **Decision Paralysis**: The formal resolution requirements for even routine decisions can stall fast-moving businesses. Many business actions require proper documentation through board resolutions.
4. **Compliance Requirements**: The ongoing disclosure requirements under the Companies Act create administrative overhead that many of my clients find time-consuming.

**For LLPs:**

1. **Fundraising Limitations**: I've watched several promising businesses hit growth plateaus they couldn't overcome because their LLP structure limited their capital-raising options to debt or partner contributions.
2. **Partner Dependency**: When one key partner in an LLP client of mine fell seriously ill, the business nearly collapsed because the LLP agreement hadn't adequately addressed continuity planning.
3. **Credibility Challenges**: Several LLP clients report difficulty winning enterprise contracts against Private Limited competitors, as procurement departments often perceive LLPs as less established.
4. **Partnership Disputes**: Without the structured governance of a company, I've mediated disputes between LLP partners where the partnership deed had gaps on crucial decision-making protocols.

# When Private Limited Makes Sense (From My Client Experiences)

I generally recommend Private Limited Companies for:

* **Tech startups**: The Companies Act's provisions for share issuance and transfer make this structure essential for attracting both talent and capital.
* **Manufacturing ventures**: When substantial capital investment is needed, especially from institutional sources.
* **Businesses with multiple founders**: The shareholding structure and Articles of Association create governance clarity that prevents later disputes.
* **Ambitious ventures**: If your five-year plan includes significant external capital or a potential exit, the Companies Act framework supports these outcomes.

# When I Recommend LLP to Clients

Not everyone needs a Private Limited Company. In fact, for many entrepreneurs I consult with, an LLP brings real advantages:

* **Professional service firms**: Many professional services operate effectively as LLPs, with the structure well-suited to their business model.
* **Real estate partnerships**: The operational flexibility and tax efficiency benefit property development projects.
* **Family businesses**: When multiple family members are involved but external investment isn't planned, LLP structures can simplify profit distribution.
* **Businesses with stable, predictable income**: If aggressive growth isn't your priority, LLP's lower compliance burden makes more sense.

# The Real Compliance Burden You Should Consider

Let me be candid about what you're signing up for:

**Private Limited Annual Compliance:**

* Annual financial audit mandatory under the Companies Act
* Annual filing of financial statements and annual returns with ROC
* Mandatory board meetings (minimum four per year)
* Annual General Meeting requirements
* Director KYC updates
* Various event-based filings for changes in structure or management

**LLP Annual Compliance:**

* Annual Statement of Accounts and Solvency
* Annual Return filing
* Audit requirements only kick in when contribution exceeds ₹25 lakhs or turnover exceeds ₹40 lakhs
* Significantly fewer event-based filings compared to companies

# My Professional Recommendation

After years of advising businesses through both structures, here's my straightforward advice:

1. **Start with Private Limited if:**
   * You envision raising equity capital at any point
   * You're building a product or service with scalability as a priority
   * You plan to incentivize employees with ownership
   * You're targeting enterprise or government clients where credibility matters
2. **Choose LLP if:**
   * Your business will primarily generate service revenue with stable partners
   * You're bootstrapping and want operational simplicity
   * Your partnership structure is relatively stable
   * Tax efficiency is a higher priority than future fundraising
3. **Consider Sole Proprietorship or Partnership if:**(For more detailed analysis on these structures, please refer to my previous articles on sole proprietorships and partnerships)
   * You're just starting your entrepreneurial journey
   * Your business is small-scale with minimal compliance capacity
   * You want maximum operational simplicity and low setup costs
   * You understand and are comfortable with the liability implications

# Final Thoughts: Structure Should Follow Strategy

I remember sitting with a young founder at a coffee shop last year. He was fixated on saving a few thousand rupees on formation costs and ongoing compliance. I asked him where he saw his business in five years, and he described a venture that would need millions in funding and dozens of employees.

""Then the structure you choose today isn't about saving money,"" I told him. ""It's about enabling that future.""

Look, I've seen this movie play out hundreds of times. The most successful entrepreneurs don't choose their business structure based on initial convenience—they choose based on where they're going.

Your business structure isn't just paperwork; it's the foundation upon which everything else is built. As your CA advisor, I'd rather you invest appropriately in getting this right at the beginning than face painful limitations later.

The question isn't really ""Private Limited or LLP?""—it's ""What future are you building?"" Answer that honestly, and the right structure becomes clear.

Dubai had it down, keeping it relatively simple and accessible through the app. The experience was more spontaneous and flowed better, so you could plan your pavilions strategically and line them up properly. Big kudos to the Dubai team for that one, though I think the difference can be more attributed to the Japanese ethos of planning ahead (I’m an outsider, take this assumption with a **LARGE** grain of salt) than the capability of the team running the show.
3- the Ring was really, really cool, and from many perspectives: seating, shelter from rain and heat, great views, gorgeous greenery
4- As a Canadian, very happy to see that Canada stepped up its game after the last Expo (pavilion looked cool in 2020 but a YouTube video would’ve sufficed)
5- Many missing countries, and pavilions without restaurants - Some countries have a lot of controversy around them currently, but controversy ends, and the Expo should be a place where we all come together and find common ground to build a better tomorrow. Also very salty that I didn’t get to have a Greek coffee and Baklava on a pretty rooftop terrace again
6- Many country pavilions were also not up and running, like Vietnam and Nepal (really bummed, Nepal looked really cool from the outside). Also, Panaf’ (African cuisine) wasn’t open, salty about that. Not crazy about the variety of food overall, though there are some standout performances (shoutout Spain, Turkey and Serbia)
7- The area with the fountain to the sound of a piano in the flooded area inside the ring - heck yeah, loved that

TL;DR: Expo 2025 felt very curated to a Japanese audience and a rigid mode of functioning, which left little room for spontaneity. Food scene wasn’t bad but was missing some attendees. Same applies for country pavilions. Good job to Osaka for a memorable fair nonetheless

I hear this almost daily in my consulting journey, and frankly, the answer isn't as straightforward as many think. Let me share some hard-earned insights from years of seeing businesses both thrive and struggle with these structures.

# The Fundamentals: What You're Really Choosing Between

When entrepreneurs come to me confused about business structures, I first clarify what they're actually deciding between:

**Private Limited Company**: This isn't just a legal entity—it's a vehicle specifically designed for growth and investment. It creates a clear separation between ownership (shareholders) and management (directors) under the Companies Act, 2013. The separate legal personality gives it perpetual succession regardless of changes in ownership.

**Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)**: Governed by the LLP Act, 2008, this hybrid structure combines the limited liability protection of a company with the tax efficiency and operational flexibility of a partnership. Both designated and ordinary partners enjoy limited liability protection, unlike in traditional partnerships where liability is unlimited.

>

# Why VCs and Angels Won't Touch Your LLP (Real Talk)

I remember one particularly painful conversation with a promising SaaS founder who had built his business as an LLP. After 18 months of bootstrapping, he'd secured investor interest but was heartbroken when they backed out upon learning his structure. Here's why this happens consistently:

1. **Equity Instruments**: The Companies Act allows Private Limited Companies to issue shares through private placement. LLPs have no such mechanism—they can only have capital contribution and profit-sharing ratios between partners as per the LLP Act.
2. **Exit Mechanics**: Just last quarter, I watched a 7-year-old business lose acquisition interest because their LLP structure complicated the buyer's standard acquisition process. Companies allow clean share transfers; LLPs require partnership restructuring.
3. **Governance Framework**: The Companies Act mandates a structured governance system with a board of directors, while LLPs operate on partnership agreements with far less statutory oversight. This governance gap makes investors uncomfortable.
4. **ESOP Implementation**: Private Limited Companies can issue employee stock options under the Companies Act. There's simply no equivalent provision in the LLP Act, making talent acquisition challenging for growing startups.

# Pain Points You'll Actually Face (That Nobody Talks About)

Beyond the textbook differences, here are real issues I've seen entrepreneurs struggle with:

**For Private Limited Companies:**

1. **Director Liability Exposure**: I've had to counsel three separate founders who faced personal notices from authorities despite the ""limited liability"" promise. The Companies Act places significant responsibilities on directors, and in cases of non-compliance, they can face personal liability.
2. **Banking Complications**: One manufacturing client waited four months for a working capital loan that an LLP structure might have secured in weeks. Banks often impose stricter lending criteria and personal guarantees on Private Limited directors.
3. **Decision Paralysis**: The formal resolution requirements for even routine decisions can stall fast-moving businesses. Many business actions require proper documentation through board resolutions.
4. **Compliance Requirements**: The ongoing disclosure requirements under the Companies Act create administrative overhead that many of my clients find time-consuming.

**For LLPs:**

1. **Fundraising Limitations**: I've watched several promising businesses hit growth plateaus they couldn't overcome because their LLP structure limited their capital-raising options to debt or partner contributions.
2. **Partner Dependency**: When one key partner in an LLP client of mine fell seriously ill, the business nearly collapsed because the LLP agreement hadn't adequately addressed continuity planning.
3. **Credibility Challenges**: Several LLP clients report difficulty winning enterprise contracts against Private Limited competitors, as procurement departments often perceive LLPs as less established.
4. **Partnership Disputes**: Without the structured governance of a company, I've mediated disputes between LLP partners where the partnership deed had gaps on crucial decision-making protocols.

# When Private Limited Makes Sense (From My Client Experiences)

I generally recommend Private Limited Companies for:

* **Tech startups**: The Companies Act's provisions for share issuance and transfer make this structure essential for attracting both talent and capital.
* **Manufacturing ventures**: When substantial capital investment is needed, especially from institutional sources.
* **Businesses with multiple founders**: The shareholding structure and Articles of Association create governance clarity that prevents later disputes.
* **Ambitious ventures**: If your five-year plan includes significant external capital or a potential exit, the Companies Act framework supports these outcomes.

# When I Recommend LLP to Clients

Not everyone needs a Private Limited Company. In fact, for many entrepreneurs I consult with, an LLP brings real advantages:

* **Professional service firms**: Many professional services operate effectively as LLPs, with the structure well-suited to their business model.
* **Real estate partnerships**: The operational flexibility and tax efficiency benefit property development projects.
* **Family businesses**: When multiple family members are involved but external investment isn't planned, LLP structures can simplify profit distribution.
* **Businesses with stable, predictable income**: If aggressive growth isn't your priority, LLP's lower compliance burden makes more sense.

# The Real Compliance Burden You Should Consider

Let me be candid about what you're signing up for:

**Private Limited Annual Compliance:**

* Annual financial audit mandatory under the Companies Act
* Annual filing of financial statements and annual returns with ROC
* Mandatory board meetings (minimum four per year)
* Annual General Meeting requirements
* Director KYC updates
* Various event-based filings for changes in structure or management

**LLP Annual Compliance:**

* Annual Statement of Accounts and Solvency
* Annual Return filing
* Audit requirements only kick in when contribution exceeds ₹25 lakhs or turnover exceeds ₹40 lakhs
* Significantly fewer event-based filings compared to companies

# My Professional Recommendation

After years of advising businesses through both structures, here's my straightforward advice:

1. **Start with Private Limited if:**
   * You envision raising equity capital at any point
   * You're building a product or service with scalability as a priority
   * You plan to incentivize employees with ownership
   * You're targeting enterprise or government clients where credibility matters
2. **Choose LLP if:**
   * Your business will primarily generate service revenue with stable partners
   * You're bootstrapping and want operational simplicity
   * Your partnership structure is relatively stable
   * Tax efficiency is a higher priority than future fundraising
3. **Consider Sole Proprietorship or Partnership if:**(For more detailed analysis on these structures, please refer to my previous articles on sole proprietorships and partnerships)
   * You're just starting your entrepreneurial journey
   * Your business is small-scale with minimal compliance capacity
   * You want maximum operational simplicity and low setup costs
   * You understand and are comfortable with the liability implications

# Final Thoughts: Structure Should Follow Strategy

I remember sitting with a young founder at a coffee shop last year. He was fixated on saving a few thousand rupees on formation costs and ongoing compliance. I asked him where he saw his business in five years, and he described a venture that would need millions in funding and dozens of employees.

""Then the structure you choose today isn't about saving money,"" I told him. ""It's about enabling that future.""

Look, I've seen this movie play out hundreds of times. The most successful entrepreneurs don't choose their business structure based on initial convenience—they choose based on where they're going.

Your business structure isn't just paperwork; it's the foundation upon which everything else is built. As your CA advisor, I'd rather you invest appropriately in getting this right at the beginning than face painful limitations later.

The question isn't really ""Private Limited or LLP?""—it's ""What future are you building?"" Answer that honestly, and the right structure becomes clear.

We had a lot in common right away: we were both going through separations, trying to navigate the same emotional challenges. At first, we were just getting to know each other as friends, but then feelings started to grow. I’d say he caught feelings first, and honestly, he was the one who convinced me to open up emotionally. He made me feel something I hadn’t felt in a long time seen, wanted, even hopeful.

But I was still deep in the process of grieving my past relationship. Living with my ex, co-parenting, going through financial stress, it’s all been heavy. So I admit that I was emotionally unstable at times. I tried to end things with this new guy three times because it all felt like too much. And each time, I came back quickly, apologizing and begging to try again. I know that’s not healthy, and I own that. My need for emotional connection and security sometimes gets the best of me.

There were little things that meant a lot to me like him sending coffee or flowers early on. I love small details like that; they make me feel loved(about 3times). But after a while those gestures faded. Maybe he got comfortable, or maybe something shifted when he realized how much I needed him. Maybe I scared him off with my intensity. I don’t know.

Now, we’re long distance, and that makes everything harder. I can’t see him or feel his presence, and there’s nothing around me that reminds me of him. He says he still has feelings for me, but my insecurity keeps whispering that maybe he doesn’t feel the same way anymore. I don’t know if I’m just overthinking, or if I’ve hurt something that can’t be fixed. I’m torn between wanting to hold on and knowing I need to keep healing. We had a fight recently cause I expressed myself but I don’t know how to deal with this anymore.

Anyway, I’ve always said Kona should be enjoyed with very little added to it. Well, I just went completely in the other direction. I have both the OL and VL versions. I used the VL, which is a double espresso. To compensate, for the amount of coffee, I used a lot of ice cream. A regular affogato cup or bowl is not big enough. I found the perfect vessel. The Nespresso Origin Large Coffee Cup. It’s large enough and, a double walled cup made of ceramic. Smooth on the inside with an eggshell exterior (great for gripping). 

The flavour of the Kona stays prominent throughout from beginning to end. Simply amazing. 

Next up, I’m either extracting the VL capsule in expert mode or use the OL espresso capsule. Kona is pretty much the most expensive of Nespresso capsules. It’s definitely a treat. Now, at least for me, it really is a treat. An awesome dessert. 

I didn’t add anything else to the affogato. It’s pretty good as is. Oh. I used plain vanilla ice cream. Refrained from using any alcohol of any kind. ",3,1745477771.0,nespresso,1,1.0,False

It’s a place stuck in time—flickering lights, creaky floors, and empty corridors. But last night? Last night, though, the mall showed me something I can’t unsee. Now I’m scared to close my eyes, let alone go back, for should my head start spinning again, I might go mad.

It was 2 a.m., the hour when the world feels like it’s holding its breath. The security office was a coffin of buzzing fluorescents and cracked plastic chairs, the monitors casting a sickly glow across my thermos of cold coffee. I was half-asleep, lulled by the static hum from my radio, when Camera 7—the food court feed—flickered. There I was, walking past the shuttered pretzel kiosk. My navy uniform hung loose on my frame, my slouch unmistakable. But I was here, in the office, not there. The timestamp pulsed: 2:03 a.m., now, alive.

My stomach churned, a violent swirl like gears grinding an old maschine . I grabbed my radio, my voice trembling. “Anyone in the building? Identify yourself!” Only static answered, threaded with a faint whine, like wind through a cracked window. The log showed no one signed in. I was alone. But the mall seemed to disagree.

On the screen, the figure that wore my face froze. He turned, slow as a marionette, and stared into the camera. His eyes were too large, pupils blooming like ink spilled in milk, and his mouth stretched into a smile that wasn’t mine. The smile stretched too far—unnaturally wide, like invisible hands were pulling his face from both sides.

The air in the office thickened, tasting of copper and ozone. He raised a hand, fingers elongating, curling like tendrils, and pointed, not at the camera, but through it—into me. The monitor hissed, and his face pressed against the lens, skin rippling like a pond disturbed by a stone. Then the feed dissolved - into a kaleidoscope of static, colors bleeding into shapes that made my temples throb.

I knocked over my coffee, the liquid pooling on the floor in patterns that looked like spiraling galaxies. My breath caught in shallow gasps, each one jagged, as if the air itself had grown thicker as I cycled through the other cameras.

Camera 12 - east entrance: another me, standing before the glass doors, head tilted so far it touched his shoulder, his shadow stretching across the floor, writhing like a nest of eels.

Camera 4 - the atrium: me, perched on a bench, rocking back and forth, my hands melted into my knees, fingers sinking into the flesh as though I were made of wax, softening under pressure.

Camera 9-  service corridor: me, pacing in a spiral, my footsteps leaving smears of light that pulsed and faded.

Each feed showed a new me, each more wrong.

One crawled across the electronics store’s floor, limbs bending backward, joints popping like wet wood.

Another stood in the fountain, water cascading upward, defying gravity, his reflection a fractured mosaic of eyes and mouths.

The timestamps flickered, numbers dissolving into glyphs—squirming like worms, writhing as though alive. The monitors hummed a low, discordant song, and the walls of the office seemed to pulse, veins of light threading through the plaster.

I tried my phone -dead. The radio spat static, now laced with voices, overlapping, all mine, whispering words I couldn’t grasp. The air grew heavy, pressing against my skin like damp velvet. Then the office door groaned, bending inward as if underwater. I spun around, flashlight beam slicing the dark, but the doorway was a void, swallowing light.

The monitors flickered in unison, and every feed showed *me*, standing in the office, staring at the screens. Behind each me loomed a shadow, taller than the room allowed, its edges fraying into tendrils that coiled around the walls, the ceiling, the air itself. The shadows didn’t move, but their presence burned in my mind, a weight that made my thoughts slippery.

The shadows stretched towards me, and I realized, with a sickening lurch, that they had already started to crawl inside my mind.",1,1745477762.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

We had many courses in common and ended up doing some assignments together. We hung out now and then, mostly talked about courses and general vent about college life. We weren't close friends.

We ended up in same company in different teams but same project so we do see each other often. Also, I don't have any other friends in this city and my teammates are older. So again I hung out with my friend,  mostly to rant about work. We never met outside of office. He did ask a few times for lunch or movies which I declined. 

Recently he had been acting weird and eventually he confessed. I told him I dont feel the same way and after that we have obviously stopped hanging out for tea/coffee. This seems like the best thing to do given the circumstances but I can't deny that now I don't have any friends or colleagues to talk to if I feel down at work. 

I sometimes feel like reaching out just to have the usual chit chat but that sounds like a bad idea. I mean I don't know if he would be up for it. We do see each other often being in same project and all. We politely greet each other but that's about it.

I work in a small, independently owned coffee shop. It's the most wholesome damn place you could ever work. I have worked here for years, and the owners, the staff and the customers are like family to me. The vibes are amazing, and I pride myself on always trying to be super friendly and lovely to everyone.

It's also a very small, hole-in-the-wall type of place, so when it's busy, the space is packed. A lot of people also wait for their coffees outside. This means that we have to call out customers' names QUITE loudly when it's time for them to collect their coffees, so that they can hear. We yell, basically.

I'm currently pregnant, so, not only am I not taking my ADHD meds at the moment, but I feel like I've been whacked with pregnancy brain (I've had medication breaks before and it's much worse this time - more forgetful, more spacey, the whole works). Luckily, making coffee is quite a repetitive task (in a good way). When it's busy and I’m pumping out coffees, it's easy to get into a rhythm: steam milk, pour into espresso, rinse milk jug, call out name, hand to customer. Repeat. I've done this for so long that I barely have to think about what I'm doing any more. Muscle memory takes over, and my little inattentive brain cells are free to wander all they like.

I rinse the milk jugs between coffees using a pitcher-rinser sink built into the bench (for those who don't know what I'm talking about, it's basically a tiny sink with a little nozzle in the middle, and it sprays water up into the inside of the jug when you press the upturned jug down onto the nozzle). The one at my work is CONSTANTLY failing to drain properly. It still works, but if you don't position the jug at this one specific angle, your hand and arm will get covered in a fine mist of milky backspray.

When I'm frustrated with things that don't work properly, inanimate objects, mildly annoying situations, etc, I will often swear casually in my head at them (usually 'oh f\*\*\* off...' or something like that). Today, after pouring the milk for two flat whites, then washing the jug and getting a wet arm for the fifth time, I began directing an inner monologue of expletives towards the pitcher rinser. At the same time, I called out the name of the customer written on the coffee cups.

Except what came out of my mouth - with all the volume and enthusiasm of a girl trying to make herself heard in a packed coffee shop during Thursday morning rush hour - was not 'Thanks Jake!'.

It was 'Fuck off!'.

That was it. Just 'fuck off!'. Just yelled to no one in particular at 1000 decibels.

And then I froze, staring in horror into the void that had opened up in my brain when it had apparently BROKEN IN HALF IN A MOMENT OF INSANITY.

One of my colleagues was standing right next to me, serving a group of customers at the POS. Literally they were all right next to me because the shop is the size of a fucking matchbox. I chanced a glance at her. Did she hear it? Like there was no way she (and everyone else in the shop and up the street) didn’t hear me, but did they hear IT??

Was there a chance, maybe, that the idea of me sunnily yelling ‘fuck off!’ to the sky was so improbable that everyone in the vicinity had assumed they’d misheard?

Surely, amid all the noise of the coffee machine and customers, I must have yelled out an unusual name that they couldn’t quite make out?

No no. She had heard. We locked eyes and she gave me this look of sheer wonder, tinged with a kind of mad hilarity. And we stood there for a fraction of a second, marvelling at what we had witnessed. At how spectacularly and unexpectedly I had lost my mind.

YOU GUYS AHAHDHHSHAHA.

It was 2 a.m., the hour when the world feels like it’s holding its breath. The security office was a coffin of buzzing fluorescents and cracked plastic chairs, the monitors casting a sickly glow across my thermos of cold coffee. I was half-asleep, lulled by the static hum from my radio, when Camera 7—the food court feed—flickered. There I was, walking past the shuttered pretzel kiosk. My navy uniform hung loose on my frame, my slouch unmistakable. But I was here, in the office, not there. The timestamp pulsed: 2:03 a.m., now, alive.

My stomach churned, a violent swirl like gears grinding an old maschine . I grabbed my radio, my voice trembling. “Anyone in the building? Identify yourself!” Only static answered, threaded with a faint whine, like wind through a cracked window. The log showed no one signed in. I was alone. But the mall seemed to disagree.

On the screen, the figure that wore my face froze. He turned, slow as a marionette, and stared into the camera. His eyes were too large, pupils blooming like ink spilled in milk, and his mouth stretched into a smile that wasn’t mine. The smile stretched too far—unnaturally wide, like invisible hands were pulling his face from both sides.

The air in the office thickened, tasting of copper and ozone. He raised a hand, fingers elongating, curling like tendrils, and pointed, not at the camera, but through it—into me. The monitor hissed, and his face pressed against the lens, skin rippling like a pond disturbed by a stone. Then the feed dissolved - into a kaleidoscope of static, colors bleeding into shapes that made my temples throb.

I knocked over my coffee, the liquid pooling on the floor in patterns that looked like spiraling galaxies. My breath caught in shallow gasps, each one jagged, as if the air itself had grown thicker as I cycled through the other cameras.

Camera 12 - east entrance: another me, standing before the glass doors, head tilted so far it touched his shoulder, his shadow stretching across the floor, writhing like a nest of eels.

Camera 4 - the atrium: me, perched on a bench, rocking back and forth, my hands melted into my knees, fingers sinking into the flesh as though I were made of wax, softening under pressure.

Camera 9-  service corridor: me, pacing in a spiral, my footsteps leaving smears of light that pulsed and faded.

Each feed showed a new me, each more wrong.

One crawled across the electronics store’s floor, limbs bending backward, joints popping like wet wood.

Another stood in the fountain, water cascading upward, defying gravity, his reflection a fractured mosaic of eyes and mouths.

The timestamps flickered, numbers dissolving into glyphs—squirming like worms, writhing as though alive. The monitors hummed a low, discordant song, and the walls of the office seemed to pulse, veins of light threading through the plaster.

I tried my phone -dead. The radio spat static, now laced with voices, overlapping, all mine, whispering words I couldn’t grasp. The air grew heavy, pressing against my skin like damp velvet. Then the office door groaned, bending inward as if underwater. I spun around, flashlight beam slicing the dark, but the doorway was a void, swallowing light.

The monitors flickered in unison, and every feed showed *me*, standing in the office, staring at the screens. Behind each me loomed a shadow, taller than the room allowed, its edges fraying into tendrils that coiled around the walls, the ceiling, the air itself. The shadows didn’t move, but their presence burned in my mind, a weight that made my thoughts slippery.

The shadows stretched towards me, and I realized, with a sickening lurch, that they had already started to crawl inside my mind.",2,1745477177.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

This guy liked my photo so I matched back and messaged him. I saw that he included his Instagram so after some time I messaged him on Instagram since I saw he worked a job I understood to have long hours. I thought his putting his ig handle on his profile could be a beige flag but I didn't want to assume anything.

He replied pretty quick and asked to jump a phone call same day at 5:30.

Personally I don’t like hoping immediately on a video call with someone I haven’t chatted with for too long, so I let him know I could do a call, which he agreed to.

When he called me, I could hear traffic in the background and I asked if he was safe to be on the phone. He told me not to worry because he was on speaker phone and his car can self drive.

Okay, so I already only have a fraction of your attention. Cool.

We did ask each other questions but he kind of drove the conversation, he asked in the following order

1. Job
2. How long I’ve been the area
3. Where did I grow up
4. What did I do for fun
5. My relationship history
6. My long term goals

I answered each earnestly and asked same back to him. He did answer everything too, but he had a tendency to interrupt me and move on to the next question

What I learned about him was that he had several long term relationships and the last one was an engagement that ended by the girl, due to ‘incompatibility.’

Then as I was talking he interrupted me mid sentence and told me he had another call in 30 minutes and we should get coffee if ever came to the area (we live about an hour apart from each other). What really disgusted me was how when he interrupted me, he had started the conversation about his desire to have kids so I was actually in the middle of my serious opinion on that subject, it felt extremely disrespectful.

Men/women: dating is not a job interview. Although I didn’t feel compatibility either, I felt really gross from the entire interaction, like a product on the shelf

When someone agrees to give you some time out of their day, you should assume they’re doing so with sincerity, and the least you can do for that sincerity and frankly vulnerability is have the decency to give them your full attention for the entirety of the conversation.

I get a lot of guys who want to call or video chat first before meeting but stuff like this thing makes me really adverse to considering it unless I’m sure this person is really interested.

There’s been times when I have video call with someone I already am not sure about, but I always give my full attention, and end conversation when I’m sure the other person feels comfortable (unless I feel unsafe myself).

This guy used the excuse that I talked too much about work, he complained I asked too much about his work and that he was getting off work and didn't want to think about work.

I told him: I just got off work myself, and I’m tired too. It sounds like you want me to entertain or romance you, I don’t know what kind of woman is gonna be able to woo you on the first conversation over the phone you ever had with them as you drive home from work. Maybe she’s out there, but what you’re asking for is a lot for anyone. I also told him to kick rocks on coffee because we both know that’s a lie.

He got pretty cold and hung up. Good riddance

TLDR: Dating isn't a job interview, and if you treat it that way, you're ruining the experience for everyone",1,1745476961.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

1k6lmg7,https://i.redd.it/lmfkkg9haqwe1.jpeg,"New York Of Java , a Bustling City. Omaha Daily Bee. November 10, 1901.","
(Copyright, 1901, by Frank G. Carpenter.)  
SOERBAIA, Java, Oct. 7.—(Special Correspondence of The Bee.


Have you ever heard of Soerbaia? It is the chief commercial city of this island of 2,000,000 people. It is situated as far east from Batavia as from New York to Cleveland and is connected by railroad with all parts of Java. I came to it on the government line, which crosses the island from west to east, and my whole journey was through rich plantations of coffee, tea, tobacco, sugar, indigo, and rice. There were villages in sight all the way; the people fairly swarmed, and I got some idea of the enormous population of this Dutch colony.  



The New York of Java.

Soerbaia is the New York of Java. It is its principal seaport and has the most trade. The city has 150,000 inhabitants, and of these only 7,000 are Europeans. Still, those Europeans live far better than their brothers of Europe. Many of them are rich, and their homes are palaces.  



The streets of Soerbaia are wide and shaded with magnificent trees. They are paved with asphalt and beautifully lighted. In the residence parts, every house has a large lawn about it, with palm trees, flowers, and well-kept walks. The grounds about the better homes are as large as those of Euclid Avenue and equally well kept. Some houses are of vast extent. They are one-story, but the rooms are large, with very high ceilings. Most houses have verandas roofed with red tiles, upheld by white marble pillars. Many floors are marble, including the porches. The town has electric lights. Every well-to-do man has a telephone and all modern conveniences.  



Bicycles and Automobiles.

I came here to investigate the chances for American trade. There is a good opening for our bicycles and a market for automobiles. Many American bicycles are used in Java. I see our leading makes in every town. In Soerbaia, bicycles are taxed, with numbers fastened to the back of each seat. I noticed one bearing “2,002,” indicating over 2,000 in the city. These people want quality and are accustomed to paying for it.  

It seems strange to dodge automobiles in Java, but I was nearly run down one night. The driver, a young Dutchman with his sweetheart, was oblivious to pedestrians.  



All kinds of carriages are used here: English dog carts, victorias, and landaus. The rich Dutch drive in style, and native chiefs have magnificent turnouts. The common vehicle is the *sado* or *dos-a-dos*, a pony-drawn dogcart where passengers sit facing the rear. These serve as cabs. No one walks in this heat, and roads fill with carriages during cooler hours.  



Chances for American Cottons.

Our cotton factories should send agents to Java to study local patterns. Java imports $60–80 million worth of goods annually, much of it cotton. England sells $5 million in piece goods yearly; Germany and Holland also have large shares. About $80,000 in machinery and iron is imported from England annually. The Dutch once monopolized trade, but now foreign imports face low tariffs.  



Current American goods here include carpenters’ tools and sewing machines. Cheap hand sewing machines and axes are in demand. American cottons and prints are absent—these should dominate our trade.  



How the Dutch Treat Travelers.

Commercial travelers face few entry hurdles. Customs officers are lenient. A drummer selling silver-plated ware in Batavia was allowed to sell samples duty-free in the customs house. Opportunities exist for American watches, clocks, knickknacks, and notions. Perishables like flour are impractical due to distance and high freight costs. Most goods arrive via Suez, likely to remain the route even after the Nicaragua Canal opens.  



Java’s Big Sugar Plantations.

Java uses vast machinery in its sugar mills, which should attract U.S. exporters. Most machinery now comes from Germany or England, but the U.S. buys $15 million in sugar from Soerbaia alone ($27 million total from Java last year). Java produces 1.5 billion pounds of sugar yearly, cultivated scientifically. Fields are trenched deeply; cane is planted upright. Due to disease, some cuttings come from highlands.  



Previously, government plantations dominated, but now production is on leased or private lands. By 1898, fewer than 200 government estates remained.  



The Culture System.


Many sugar factories emerged via the “culture system”: the government advanced funds to build mills, requiring natives to dedicate one-fifth of their land and one day’s weekly labor to cane. Mill owners sold one-third of product to the government at fixed rates. Holland profited $5 million annually. Factories followed government-approved plans, resulting in refined sugar costing ~1¢ per pound.  



Philippine Comparisons.

U.S. sugar methods in the Philippines are wasteful. Experimental stations could boost profits tenfold. Indigo could thrive there too—Java’s plantations ferment leaves in water, extract dye with chalk.  



Wages at 1 Cent an Hour. 

No trade unions exist here. Wages contrast starkly with Australia: laborers earn 14–16¢ daily in cities; mountain workers get <1¢ hourly. Yet Javanese live on $1.60 monthly, appear healthy, and spend earnings on vibrant clothing. English and German factories copy native designs—U.S. firms should do the same.  



Java’s New Oil Fields.

Oil fields near Soerbaia and Batavia produce inferior oil to the U.S., selling 20¢ cheaper per case. Standard Oil dominates, selling via Chinese middlemen. Oil is peddled in tiny quantities, costing ~18¢/gallon.  



Dutch Education Efforts.

The Dutch educate 200,000 of Java’s 25 million people. High schools exist in Batavia, Soerbaia, and Samarang; five colleges train teachers. Salaries are high: primary teachers earn $50–250/month, high school teachers $180–400/month, with pensions and sabbaticals. Instruction is in Dutch; students wear European clothes.  



A Visit to a Normal School.

At a normal school in Dandong, boys enter at age 12, graduate in three years. Studies include geography, algebra, chemistry, and languages (Malay, Javanese, Dutch). Students demonstrated knowledge of global geography, even unmarked railroads. Teachers praised their intelligence, equal to European children.

Anyone else feel overwhelmed with all the crypto trading platforms popping up lately?

With the rise of AI and automated trading bots, platforms like **[BlueQubit](https://is.gd/SaZlt8)** have been gaining attention fast. If you're anything like me, you're probably skeptical at first. I mean, another ""automated crypto platform"" that promises high returns? We've all seen those before. But after spending some time digging into BlueQubit, testing it out, and comparing it with similar platforms like **Bitcoin Era** and **Immediate Edge**, I’ve got some thoughts.

This review breaks down everything you need to know about BlueQubit—what it does well, where it could improve, and whether it’s actually worth your time (and money). I’ll keep it real, with personal insights, pros and cons, and a few surprises that I didn’t expect. Let’s get into it.

## What is BlueQubit?

BlueQubit is an **automated trading platform** that uses advanced algorithms to analyze market trends and execute trades on your behalf. Think of it like a smart assistant for crypto and forex trading—it watches the market 24/7, jumps on opportunities, and tries to maximize profits without needing you to stare at charts all day.

It’s designed to be user-friendly, even for people with **zero trading experience**. You just set your preferences, like how much risk you're willing to take, and let the bot do the rest. Kinda like putting your portfolio on autopilot, but with a few manual controls if you want to step in.

## Who Created BlueQubit?

Details about the **founders of BlueQubit** are a bit under wraps—nothing flashy like Elon Musk or Vitalik Buterin behind the scenes. But based on its structure and some of the broker partnerships, it looks like it was built by a team of fintech developers and AI engineers, similar to other platforms like **Bitcoin Code**.

While the anonymous dev angle might raise some eyebrows, that’s not unusual in the crypto world. What matters more is that BlueQubit partners with **regulated brokers**, which adds a layer of legitimacy. I also found that third-party reviews and user feedback lean more positive than shady, which is always a good sign.

## How Does BlueQubit Work?

BlueQubit uses a combination of **AI algorithms, machine learning, and real-time market data** to scan for profitable trades. Once it finds a trade that fits your preferences (risk level, asset type, strategy), it automatically executes it through one of its integrated brokers.

Here’s a basic breakdown:
- The AI scans for market signals and news events.
- It predicts price movements using historical data and trends.
- When it finds a match, it places a trade through the broker.
- You can monitor or manually intervene at any time.

What I like is that it supports **multiple asset classes**, so you’re not stuck with just Bitcoin—you can dabble in forex, stocks, and even commodities. It’s like having a mini Wall Street terminal in your pocket.

## BlueQubit Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real. No platform is perfect, and BlueQubit has its strengths and quirks.

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Automated trading** with minimal effort required
- ✅ **Beginner-friendly** interface—no jargon overload
- ✅ **Real-time data analysis** for faster decision-making
- ✅ **Demo account** to test before investing real money
- ✅ **Responsive customer support**
- ✅ Trades across **crypto, forex, and more**

**Cons:**
- ❌ **No mobile app** yet (but mobile-optimized web works fine)
- ❌ **$250 minimum deposit** might be steep for total beginners
- ❌ Limited information about the development team

## What Devices Can be Used to Access BlueQubit?

You don’t need a NASA-grade computer to run BlueQubit. It’s **fully web-based**, which means you can access it from:

- 🖥️ **Desktop computers** (Windows, macOS)
- 📱 **Mobile phones** (iOS, Android)
- 💻 **Tablets and iPads**

The platform is optimized for mobile browsers, so even without a dedicated app, it runs smoothly on smaller screens. I used it on both my laptop and Android phone, and the mobile experience was surprisingly slick.

## BlueQubit – Supported Countries

BlueQubit seems to be available in a **wide range of countries**, including:

- United States
- United Kingdom
- Canada
- Australia
- South Africa
- Most of Europe
- Parts of Asia and Latin America

There are a few **restricted countries** like North Korea (obviously), and some parts of the Middle East. But for the most part, it’s accessible in major crypto-friendly regions. Just make sure to check if your local laws allow crypto trading platforms like this.

## BlueQubit – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

BlueQubit’s AI engine constantly scans markets for **price fluctuations, trends, and news events**. It reacts faster than any human could, which is a massive edge in volatile markets like crypto.

### User-Friendly Interface

Even if you’ve never placed a trade in your life, BlueQubit walks you through the process. The UI is clean and uncluttered—no confusing graphs or Wall Street lingo. Just click, set preferences, and you're good.

### Mobile Accessibility

Although there's no dedicated app, the **mobile web version** is fully functional. I managed trades while waiting in line for coffee, and it didn’t crash or lag. That’s a win.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up **custom alerts** for key price movements, trade executions, or market news. It helps keep you in the loop without constantly checking your dashboard.

### Multiple Asset Trading

You’re not limited to Bitcoin or Ethereum. BlueQubit supports:
- 💰 Cryptocurrencies
- 💹 Forex
- 📈 Stocks
- 🛢️ Commodities

This gives you more ways to diversify and potentially reduce risk.

## Is BlueQubit a Scam?

Honestly, I get why people ask this. There are tons of sketchy platforms out there. But after testing BlueQubit and looking at how it operates, I don’t think it’s a scam.

- ✅ It **partners with regulated brokers**
- ✅ Has **transparent terms and conditions**
- ✅ Offers a **demo account** to test the system
- ✅ Doesn’t make wild promises like “get rich in 24 hours”

It’s not a magic money machine, and it doesn’t pretend to be one. You still need to understand the basics of trading, and there’s always risk. But it’s not shady.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on BlueQubit?

BlueQubit requires a **$250 minimum deposit** to start trading. This seems to be the industry standard for platforms like this, though I wish it were a bit lower to make it more accessible.

The good news is you can use the **demo account** first, so you don’t have to risk real money until you’re confident.

### BlueQubit Customer Support

Customer support is available via:
- 💬 **Live chat** (24/7)
- 📧 **Email support**

I tested the live chat with a couple of questions, and the response was quick and helpful. No bots pretending to be humans—actual responses that made sense.

## How do you start trading on BlueQubit?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official BlueQubit site and enter your name, email, and phone number. Registration is free and takes less than 2 minutes.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once signed up, you’ll be matched with a **partner broker**. You’ll need to **verify your identity** (standard KYC stuff), and then make your **first deposit of $250**.

### Step 3: Start Trading

You can now access the dashboard, set your trading preferences, and either go full-auto or trade manually. I recommend starting with the **demo mode** to get a feel for how it works.

## How to Delete a BlueQubit Account?

If you decide BlueQubit isn’t for you, just reach out to customer support and request an account closure. They’ll guide you through the process. Make sure to **withdraw any remaining balance** before you do.

### [🔥 Start Trading with BlueQubit Today](https://is.gd/SaZlt8)
## The Verdict

So, is BlueQubit worth it?

If you're looking for a **simple, automated trading platform** that doesn’t require you to be a crypto expert, BlueQubit delivers. It’s not perfect—no app and a slightly high entry cost—but it’s **reliable, easy to use**, and has some solid tech behind it.

I’d recommend it to:
- Beginners who want to dip into automated trading
- Casual investors looking for passive income tools
- Traders who want a multi-asset platform with AI features

Just keep your expectations grounded. It’s a tool, not a money printer.

I recently used my American Express (Amex) card at a Shell station—not for fuel, but for a simple oil change and to buy a bottle of water. Later I noticed a 2.5% ""convenience fee"" added on top of my purchase.

I reached out to Amex support and they confirmed that any purchase—yes, even a coffee or a snack—at certain fuel merchants like Shell will incur this extra 2.5% fee plus applicable taxes.

Apparently, it doesn't matter if you're buying fuel or not. Just being at that merchant is enough to trigger the fee. It’s pretty ridiculous, especially if you're already getting an invoice and not using any actual ""convenience"" service.

So yeah, next time I won’t be using Amex at Shell, and I recommend you don’t either unless you’re okay with paying extra for no real reason.

I hope my review helps.

Lingoda is a language learning platform offering German, English, Business English, Spanish, French and Italian.

From April 2023 0 -> B2 Dec 2024 

My partner is native and his family speaks only German, so I am in for a treat every coffee and dinner, so you understand my motivation is intertwined with desperation.

My journey with Lingoda started in April 2023, I started with a Sprint, my advice: it's only worth it if you have the the certainty you can attend every f day.

Lingoda, itself, it's a great platform with very good teachers, serious classmates and thorough rules that kind of ""motivate"" you to stay disciplined.

What I wished I knew as a beginner in Apr 2024:

Orientation class is a waste of your credit because it basically just presents the platform, DM me and I will send you a summary of what happens there and save your actual learning credit.  
If you like a teacher, you can go to the that teachers board and book their classes, I swear having a class with a teacher I liked made the biggest difference.(My German recommendations: Agnieska, Ozlem, Julia, Branislav, etc).  
\*hint: book from ahead of time and aim to have classes as early in the morning as possible since that s when you have the chances of being just you and the teacher or just 2 people and the teacher = more speaking time, basically a 1o1 class on sale.

3. Prepare for every class with the vocabulary and do the homework or exercises proposed as homework in the previous class.

4. Try to stay as chronological as possible with the classes because the level between Chapter 1-2-3 vs 11-12 is very different and it just smooths your learning curve.

5. You only need to do 45 classes/50 to get the certificate, my advice is to skip first orientation and some of the starting communication classes( even if you skip them you can book the class, download the material and cancel immediately using the 30 min after book free cancellation policy). NEVER skip in GRAMMAR classes because in my opinion are the most important.

As a comparison to Babbel Live, Lingoda offers more, the certificate is recognized and Lingoda has for B1 135 classes offer, while Babbel has only 36, focusing mainly on speaking.

If you are thinking about trying out Lingoda here is my referral link: [https://www.l16sh94jd.com/BK76FN/55M6S/?\_\_efq=Jra9uagPp9Rnev2\_qdXL1-9wpMHMUeNa1qll772BMvA](https://www.l16sh94jd.com/BK76FN/55M6S/?__efq=Jra9uagPp9Rnev2_qdXL1-9wpMHMUeNa1qll772BMvA)

I dig monthly for discounts because I am a cheap as that can't pay full price so I got most of the months 20-30% discounts on plans for 20-40 classes so the price/class stayed in 7-8 eur range which is cheaper than a class in my home country.

P.S.: There are insane 40% on top of my discount these days.

No hidden truth: you get paid for recommending Lingoda, but what I would offer you is a free 30 mins presentation from my account of their possibilities and my honest B1.2 from 0 feedback after many errors I wish I knew better.",0,1745475839.0,languagelearning,0,0.33,False

So I’m looking for recommendations on must-see cafes or bars that are perfect for people watching for a few hours over a bottle of wine or coffee with my wife (if in the sun even better, as Mondays looking nice)

Looking forward to visiting the city. 

Edit: doesn’t have to be a cafe or bar, could be a park bench!",1,1745475470.0,Bilbao,1,0.67,False
