**Eat Like the Sun:**

**Biggest meal at breakfast** (protein + fiber), lighter at dinner.

Stop eating 3 hours before bed (boosts fat-burning overnight).

**Move Within 90 Minutes of Waking:**

5 min of stretching or a walk *before* coffee = 20% more fat burn all day.

**Cold Exposure:**

End showers with 30 sec of cold water (brown fat activation = burns calories).

**Sleep in Total Darkness:**

Pitch black = deeper sleep → balances hunger hormones.

I thought we had a perfect relationship—date nights, vacations, dumb inside jokes, and a home we built together. She was my best friend. Turns out, she was also a professional liar.

Last Friday, I was supposed to be working late. She *knew* this. She kissed me goodbye that morning, told me she’d be *home all night*, and even sent me a “Miss you ❤️” text during the day. Meanwhile, the woman was probably *picking out lingerie* for some other dude. But I didn’t know that yet. Around 8 PM, I decided to surprise her by grabbing her favorite pizza on my way home—half pepperoni, half mushroom, from the same local spot we’ve ordered from for years. That’s where things went *so* far off the rails I might as well have been in another dimension.

I pull up to our house, pizza in hand, and immediately notice something weird—a pizza delivery guy is already at my front door. But here’s the thing: **we never order delivery.** She always says it’s a waste of money when we can just pick it up. So why is this random dude standing there with a pizza box? I stay in my car, watching as my wife opens the door, *wearing a tight red dress*, hair and makeup fully done like she’s about to hit the club. Then I hear it.

A *man’s voice* from inside the house says, **“Damn, that was fast. I’m starving.”**

I feel my soul leave my body. My stomach drops. I step closer, heart pounding in my ears. My wife takes the pizza and hands the delivery guy **cash** (which she NEVER does—she always pays online). Then she steps back inside. *Without even noticing me standing in the driveway.*

I’m seeing red. I march up to the door, fling it open like I’m in an action movie, and there he is—some **shirtless dude**, sitting on my couch, feet up on my coffee table, casually eating a slice of pizza like he just got home from a long day at work. And this dude isn’t even in a rush to explain himself. He just stares at me, mid-bite, like *I’M* the one in the wrong here.

“Oh, sh\*t,” he mutters, swallowing.

My wife? **Frozen.** Complete deer in headlights.

Me? I start laughing. Like, full-blown *Joker* laughter because my brain has completely short-circuited. Then I snap back to reality and say, **“Oh wow, you guys having a date night? That’s so cute. Maybe I should join?”**

She starts crying. Shirtless McGee drops his pizza. Buster, my **traitorous** dog, immediately eats it off the floor. But then, this guy—this absolute *legend* of an idiot—**looks me dead in the eyes and says, “Bro, it’s not what it looks like.”**

Not what it looks like? **NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE?!** My dude, you are half-naked, in my house, eating my wife’s pizza, and you think you can gaslight me into believing this is just a casual hangout?! I lose it. “Oh, my bad, are you the new plumber? Let me guess—you had to take your shirt off because the pipes are leaking?”

Silence. Then my wife, the *love of my life*, the woman I thought I *knew*, has the AUDACITY to say, **“Can we talk about this?”**

Talk? TALK?!

I walk out. She chases me, sobbing. Meanwhile, Pizza Boy is just standing there, still holding his shirt, probably trying to figure out if he should run. I get in my car and drive straight to my best friend Jake’s house, where I tell him the whole story. And this is where things get worse.

Jake pulls out his phone and asks, **“Wait… what pizza place did you say?”** I tell him. He frowns. **“Dude… they don’t do delivery.”**

My stomach drops. I immediately call the restaurant. The manager picks up.

“Hey, do you guys do delivery?”

“Nah, man. Pickup only.”

“...Are you SURE?”

“Pretty damn sure.”

So I ask him another question: **“Do you know a guy who looks like this?”** I describe Shirtless McGee.

The manager **laughs.** “Oh, that guy? Yeah, he comes in all the time… with his girlfriend. She always orders the half-pepperoni, half-mushroom.”

My stomach **implodes.** HIS. GIRLFRIEND. SHE’S BEEN ORDERING OUR PIZZA… FOR THEM.

Jake and I go full detective mode. We track down his fiancée on Facebook. I message her everything, including **pictures and videos** of the aftermath. She responds almost instantly:

**“Oh my god. I had a feeling. Can I call you?”**

We talk. For HOURS. Turns out, *she’d been suspicious for months*. And guess what? *My wife and her fiancé had been sneaking around for OVER A YEAR.* They met at some work event, exchanged numbers, and apparently thought they were in some *forbidden love story*. Meanwhile, I was paying the mortgage and *this dude* was eating my groceries.

The next day, we both kick them out. Divorce papers are filed within the week. And here’s the kicker… in the aftermath of our breakups, we kept talking. And talking. And talking. What started as venting turned into coffee. Coffee turned into dinner. Dinner turned into, well… let’s just say **she doesn’t have to order pizza for another man anymore.**

Fast-forward a year, and guess what? We’re engaged. The wedding is next summer. And before you ask, **yes, we’re serving pizza.**

Oh, and Buster? Yeah, he’s forgiven. But he’s not getting any.",1,1743056048.0,Infidelity,1,1.0,False

I am functional in every way, happy and energetic and playful with my colleagues. The darkness sinks in after work. Every day it gets more and more difficult to wake up in the morning. I curl up in bed the minute I am home, huddled under my weighted blanket and refuse to leave the bed until the very last minute I have to be up just before I am late for work. I fight all the time this deep empty lonely ache in my chest. Beyond work, I have no reason to live. I barely speak to anyone. Even when I do speak to people, it feels empty and hollow and I am just exhausted all the time after it. I spent 3 hours having coffee and meaningful conversation with a friend last week and by the end of it, I just wished I were curled up in bed not doing anything. I wish I didn't have a job, that I wasn't working so I could just od without guilt, without worrying that I will be absent the next day at work and having to wonder who will have to cover for me. It feels like beyond work, I have no life. Not because I don't have hobbies or options, but because I am so depressed, I don't service any joy from them anymore. I don't enjoy hanging out or talking to my friends. I don't enjoy the sports I used to. Everything feels empty and mundane and so so meaningless. ",1,1743055972.0,SuicideWatch,0,1.0,False

Background: I'm having such a great week, wow, I've never had my life this together! I celebrate my little successes and feel good about myself. Until...that is, I discover that I do not know where my generic Vyvanse is. It's another two weeks until I'm able to get a refill. Also, my doctor appears to be all booked up for the next 3 weeks, and I don't even know if she would do anything to help here. I need to find the pills. I'm 99% sure they are in my apartment somewhere.

I last saw it this morning. I held the bottle in my hand. I took it from its designated location on the nightstand and put it on the coffee table. It normally never leaves the nightstand. I thought I could change the process to make it more efficient. This process involves taking a second pill (I take a split dose 2 hrs apart) from the main container and putting it into a small pill container for me to take to work. I don't carry the main container around for fear of loss or theft. 

I last remember grabbing the bottle back up from the coffee table in the living room and taking it into the hallway between the bedroom and bathroom, and standing there in a sort of decision paralysis. Wanting to take out the second pill, wash my face, put on music, and check emails all at the same time. I don't remember which action I took next, or if I did something else all together. I'm not even sure if I eventually put a second pill in the small container or took my second dose today (early morning meetings mess up my routine). I felt more tired and less motivated today. I don't know if I put the main bottle back on the coffee table, nightstand or in some other random location during decision paralysis or haphazard multitask event. 

I've looked in the obvious places and scanned the floor. Been looking for the bottle for hours. I'm running out of ideas.

I've been to Cancun three times and loved different aspects of each resort, but now I’m looking for the perfect all-inclusive for my next trip. Here’s where I’ve stayed and what I liked/disliked:

**1st Trip: Barceló Maya Caribe & Riviera (Caribe 3 nights, Riviera 3 nights, 2021)**

✅ **Likes:**

* Huge resort—there’s even a double-decker bus to get around
* Lots of restaurants
* Free water sports (loved the windsurfing boat)
* Riviera section felt modern and the adult only vibe was nice

❌ **Dislikes:**

* Resort is so big that there’s a lot of walking
* Food was just okay, not amazing
* Caribe section felt old and could use updates
* A bit far from the airport, but not terrible

**2nd Trip: Royal Uno (Now Hilton Cancun Mar Caribe) ($1680, 6 nights, 2022)**

✅ **Likes:**

* Modern and clean
* Amazing ocean view from the room
* Small and easy to get around
* Food was better than Barceló
* Café with drinks, snacks, ice cream, and crepes ❤️

❌ **Dislikes:**

* Resort felt a little too small at times
* Limited activities, restaurant and buffet options

**3rd Trip: Planet Hollywood ($1420, 5 nights, 2023)**

✅ **Likes:**

* Lazy river—I don’t know why, but I LOVED it! ❤️
* Better food than Barceló
* Tennis and mini-golf were fun extras
* Café with drinks/snacks/ice cream (though drinks were meh)
* Adult only section—separate pool was nice

❌ **Dislikes:**

* Rooms felt aged—some things were broken/not working
* Had to switch rooms on the 2nd or 3rd day due to a broken door lock

# 

**TLDR What I’m Looking for in My 4th Trip (4-5 nights, <$2000) :**

✅ **Must-Haves:**

1jkx7lj,https://www.reddit.com/r/MilkyWayIdle/comments/1jkx7lj/helping_new_players_to_make_gold/,Helping new players to make gold,"A few months ago, I asked how to make gold in the game to get better equipment, and no one answered me. Unfortunately, Milky’s player is stingy. So, I'll help those who are just starting with some tips.

By using the MWI Tools extension, you can hover over some items in the foraging skill and see, on the last line, how much that resource generates per hour based on your equipped tool and other factors. Use this to track which resources are currently the most profitable. Soon, you’ll be able to make around 15-16 million gold per day by selling these resources on the market.

Always battle whenever you can! The most efficient way I’ve found to make quick gold is by fighting. Currently, I make around 32-35 million gold as an Archer on the planet Sorcerer's Tower.
You can use the game’s Wiki to check the ""best party composition"" section, which provides guidance on the best planets for your weapon type. Early on, making gold through battles can be tough—so cook, brew your coffees, and after each battle, place the battle essences you collect into ""Coinfy"" under the Alchemy skill.

Reminder: Once you reach higher-level planets compatible with your weapon progression, you won’t need to rely on cooking and brewing anymore. The gold you earn from battles will be enough to buy food and coffee while still securing a significant profit.

I have some guild members who consistently earn around 40-48 million gold per day on planets like Infernal Abyss, Golem Cave, and Twilight Zone.

Sure the hard data of HR, oxygen etc could be very accurate but the interpretation at the end just feels completely off.

And I thought it was because I didn’t have the ring for long enough. But if 3 months is still not long enough then I don’t know. Plus they are basically charging me a subscription fee just to give me inaccurate information, while I understand it is necessary in the beginning but still the thought of it doesn’t sit well with me.

I also find tagging tedious and creates biases on your reports.

I’m being extremely vague here but an example I can think of right now is that tagging “coffee” actually affects my scores whilst tagging it as “covfefe”, doesn’t. Even though my days would be exactly the same.

Another example is sleep score, I sometimes wear a CPAP and sometimes don’t, but the days I wear CPAP I get good asf sleep and feel extremely fresh in the mornings and I would get a terrible score.

Conversely, I would sometimes accidentally fall asleep without my CPAP and feel absolutely sluggish the next day and my sleep score would be high.

I know there are reasons why the interpretations come out that way and they are probably correct in their algorithm created from their databases etc etc but my point is why would pay for it now if I know that I’m never gonna get accurate data? 

I also know some people who work night shifts and their scores are just all over the place.

Also I lift, and I have to take off my ring before my workouts cus damn I am so scared of getting my finger ripped off or scratching the ring. 

So arguably the two most important metrics I care about, which is sleep and workouts, I can’t use properly. 

I wanted to get the ring for so long now and I’ve been reading reviews, watching videos about them. 

Finally pulled the trigger and can confidently say it’s just not my cup of tea.

I ended up selling it for 100 bucks.

It was cool in the beginning but having the ring also made me check my phone first thing in the morning which is a really bad habit, plus the scores it gives me also affects my mood in a negative way.

All in all I’m still glad I bought it cus I would’ve wondered about it for the rest of my life.

If you’re reading this and deciding if you should give it a try I would say do it if you can afford it and find out. 

That’s all, just a little rant.

If the ring treats you well, I’m very happy for you!

1jkx1ry,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jkx1ry,Zermatt trip report in March - skiing in paradise ❤️,"We just skied the past few days in Zermatt/Cervina. Lucked out with the weather and had two amazing blue bird days! The food and apres scene is amazing - just endless good views and vibes. Thanks for a wonderful visit, I used this sub for research and got a lot of good info. Sharing my trip report in case it helps anyone else :)

**Day 1: Gornergrat & Zermatt town**
Arrived in Zermatt around 1pm and dropped off luggage at **Hotel Pollux**. Debated getting a half day ski pass but we were tired from the train ride and decided to have a chill day. Got a coffee at **Petit Royal Cafe**. Then headed to Gornergrat Railway station to head up the mountain. Had lunch at **Alphitta**, near **Riffelalp** station - amazing large patio looking toward the Matterhorn, it’s not too hard to get to by walking. Cheerful vibes with live music. Then went up to **Gornergrat**, the views on the way up are great (sit on the right side during ascent). Enjoyed the paragliding simulation in the museum. Later we walked around town for some shopping, and then had dinner at **Restaurant Vieux-Valais da Nico** (very authentic Italian food with big portions!)

**Day 2: Matterhorn Glacier Paradise & Cervinia**
Took the free e-bus to **Matterhorn Glacier Paradise** station, then followed a series of gondolas all the way up. The viewing platform at the top is incredible! And the ski down to Italy is magical, we made it all the way to the base of **Cervinia**. We had lunch at **Igloo** with a nice outdooor terrace (huge portions and super fast service), then slowly made our way back to Zermatt. From the top of Matterhorn Glacier Paradise we skied all the way toward the base. Took a short break at **Restaurant Stafelalp** (with a great close up view of the Matterhorn) and then headed toward **Hennu Stall** (DJ party vibes, drinking, dancing and smoking, fun to check out but skippable if you’re not into partying). The way from Furi to the base was very mushy with a few uphill sections so it was a struggle to get down the mountain, I recommend just downloading from Furi. For dinner we went to **L’Atelier Grandsire** (French fine dining). It was probably the best and most expensive meal we had, it really felt like Michelin style fine dining without Michelin prices. 

**Day 3: Rothorn, Gornergrat, Cervinia**
Took the free e-bus again, to the **Sunnega Funicular** station. We went all the way to **Rothorn** and skiied a few runs in that area (including a detour to check out **Findeln**) then started to traverse across to **Hohtalli** and down to **Furi** to get on the gondolas to Italy. Actually preferred this “late” start to the Italy side since the gondolas were less crowded. Had lunch at **Chalet Etoile** (cheapest meal we had with amazing vibes and views), then headed back to Zermatt. We skied around Gornergrat and visited **Igloo Dorf** for hot chocolate and coffee. Then took the train from Riffelalp back down. Relaxed at the hotel sauna and bar before having dinner at **Manud** (pretty good Asian food which we were craving after so many days of eating bread and cheese!)

3 days felt like a good minimum amount of time to spend in Zermatt, but again we got super lucky with weather and being able to see the Matterhorn every day. In cloudy or snowy weather the views are not good. The good thing is that the weather changes fast so even if it’s cloudy it can clear up later.  

Finally, one thing that surprised me is how Italian Zermatt feels. It’s just bustling with energy that reminds me of Italian towns - a little bit of chaos but a lot of charm. It’s truly a unique place!

**Tips:**
- Download the Matterhorn app for access to the map on your phone. Service coverage is pretty good all over the mountain. (Except if you go to Italy, and don’t have Italy data)
- Use the free E-bus to get from your hotel to the stations
- Food is very expensive! Sit down lunch around 20-30CHF/person, dinner around 50 CHF/person or possibly more. Italy side has cheaper food so it’s totally worth going if it’s open. I also thought service was way faster in Italy while the Swiss restaurants involved a lot of waiting for the food and bill (typical European style slow dinners)
- Be prepared to walk A LOT. On uphill traverses, at the stations, and around town.
- The snow is better in Cervinia, while Zermatt side is a little icier and very variable (slushy sections on the lower part of the mountain). In Zermatt the best snow was Matterhorn Glacier Paradise and Gornergrat. 
- The weather changes very fast, it can be cloudy, then sunny, then snowing, all in one day. 
- The view of the Matterhorn also changes a lot, even in clear days it can be partially covered by clouds. But just wait as the clouds do move around.",5,1743054315.0,Zermatt,2,1.0,False

I owe that to my parents. They never wanted me and neither did most of my family, that was very clear to me. I think they were right to not want me around. Part of me has always felt like a burden, like I was just taking up space and that my presence wasn’t meaningful, I never found a place that felt like home. I don’t blame them though, they were young too. I only wish that had just given me up for adoption instead of making me live a life knowing I wasn’t wanted.

“You know how it happens sometimes... A person does everything so that no one will love him. As if that weren’t enough—he does it in such a way that, when he dies, no one can even say anything good about him. But God is so abundantly merciful that He brings his loved ones to Him, His grace touches and warms their hearts in such a way that they yearn to pray for those who have warped their whole life. And it is comforting for all concerned—both the offended and their offenders. Because resentment is the captivity of the soul. Whereas forgiveness is its freedom.

>**Resentment enslaves the soul. Forgiveness frees it**

Father Evgeniy, a priest from the Donbas, once shared this story.

A certain family was suffering from major tensions between the children and their mother. Well, in other words, they had strained relations. But then the son, who came to faith as an adult, was able to get his dying mother to confess to a priest and receive Holy Communion before her death. They asked forgiveness from one another, and thus she peacefully departed this life.

When that woman had a church funeral, everyone present felt such joy in their hearts, as if their souls had finally escaped from captivity and rejoiced, singing hymns to freedom.

**Touched by God**

“It often happens that family members encounter all kinds of contradictions, small and large, that get in the way of living in peace. Basically, just to live,” batiushka told me at the time. “Apparently these people could even share love (and some of them did!), but all those quarrels, conflicts, and scandals were simply too big of an obstacle on the way of love. So, when one of them dies, it seems to be huge grief (yet some don’t see it that way!), but the most amazing thing here is that nothing really stands in the way of love. Every obstacle to love disappears along with earthly life. Now love can truly triumph! And it is time for peace and joy to reign.

Batiushka told his parishioners this story about the mother, the son and a triumph of love after death. Without sharing any names, of course.

“So, it turns out that the Lord arranges it all ever-so-wisely,” he told me, “and the events in the lives of some people don’t end exclusively with them, but they deliver certain spiritual benefit to others, complete strangers, unknown to them. Yes, everything has a reason in this world… Everything…”

Suddenly, another story came to my mind in this regard. I had heard it from someone before…

Once, a man on crutches came to see a priest:

“Batiushka, my life has hit a terrible rough patch. My parents died one after another, followed by my aunt. Then, my best friend died. My child ended up in the hospital, and then my wife, too. I had a car accident and broke my leg. What should I do?”

“This is the Lord calling you to Himself.”

“What? Am I responsible for all those deaths and illnesses?!”

“No, of course not. Each man has his own path in life and his own time to go, to get sick and to recover. But the Lord arranges it so that it wouldn’t pass in vain, without meaning and benefit for man. So He will put together the circumstances in such a way that each of us feels His touch. These are the touches of God...”

I was really impressed with it at the time. Touches…

**Only good people attend church**

“I shared this story about a son and his deceased mother with one man,” Father Evgeniy continued. “He had a father who died a long time ago. But when he was still alive, he always made a public nuisance of himself. He’d get drunk, commit adultery, and mess around. He’d beat his wife and his son.

>**His father has died, but it didn't become any easier. He was gone, but the hatred stayed**

So, his son grew up, he had his own family, but just as he hated his father in childhood so he continued to hate him after his death. He couldn’t forgive him for his mother’s tears, the bruises on her face, or how he himself would hide in the corner, whimpering and shaking with fear. How he would be afraid to go home and envied all the happy families around him. As a teenager, the only thought he cherished was killing or poisoning his father with his own hands, taking revenge for all those torments. But he neither killed nor poisoned him, because his father died of natural causes. But that never made it any easier. The man was gone, but the hatred remained.”

“Then, not long before his father died, he put on the cross he had never worn before,” said Father Evgeniy. “Apparently he sensed his imminent death and saw the worthlessness of his life. And so, he reached out to God. It often happens this way. However, when he put on the cross, his relatives treated him as some sort of beast. “You torment us here and behave like a moron, like a vampire drinking our blood. And then you start wearing a cross?!” That’s what they thought of it. It would seem that they would have been glad, because the man had turned away from darkness to the light. But none of them were churchgoers at that time. To them it was pure hypocrisy.

Let me digress… I also come from a non-religious family. But I was baptized by my maternal grandfather. I was twelve at the time. He gathered all of his grandchildren in the summer (we all came to Krasnodar) and took them to church. Basically, my church life stopped there for many long years.

At that time, my grandfather was only taking his first steps as a Christian himself. I don’t know how deep his faith was, as he never took me to church services. But he tried to make me read the Bible, which I resisted as hard as I could. I only remember well how the adults—my parents, uncles and aunts—laughed at the fact that someone like my grandfather “had become so keen on religion.”

Only later when I was older, from conversations in our family I learned that he had always been a very complex and difficult man. He was quite a tyrant to his loved ones. I never experienced it myself, though. And so I was quite surprised. But when I became a churchgoing Christian, I remembered with gratitude that it was him who baptized me. I also couldn’t understand why everyone was so disgruntled when he turned to the faith. If he had such bad temper, this should have made everyone glad. A man has repented. Or, at least he stepped on the path to repentance.

But, apparently, this is how it all looks to non-religious people—hypocrisy and a desecration of the cross. Because “only the good ones go to church.”

“**That no-gooder has ruined your life, and you have nothing else left”**

“As for the man who put on the cross, he once tore it off in drunken stupor and threw it away,” said Father Evgeniy. “But once he sobered up, he picked it up, kissed it and put it back on. And he died soon afterwards. But his son held a grudge against him all his life. He hated his parent for ten more years after his death. Then he came to the faith. Ten more years have passed. He’s been going to church for ten years. But nevertheless, he couldn't forgive his father. Then I told him the story of the mother and her children who were at odds with her. And how after her death all differences disappeared. I also told him how death could become the triumph of love instead of grief. I didn't do this on purpose, I didn’t even think intentionally about it. It just happened. And at that moment, his face changed, it as if smoothed out somehow. He later said that, at that moment, he looked at his past and his father’s death in a completely different way. Not with hatred, but pity. His heart softened up and he found himself longing to pray for his parent. He realized that the way he lived was so awful, simply disastrous. There is nothing worse than the poverty of spirit that his father had, not knowing God, having nothing. And then suddenly, a yet faint glimmer of joy… The son remembered how his father had once picked up the cross he had thrown away before, kissed it and put it around his neck. Sure, he died without having Confession and Communion. But maybe the Lord granted mercy to him only because of this impulse! Despite the twenty years that passed after his father’s death, his son began to pray for him. And everyone felt relief.”

Father Evgeniy finished his story, but the next day he called me again. And he spoke about time and eternity… How we live in time and sin in time. And how our life is a temporary thing. Our wrongs were committed over time, just as were our evil memories. So, if a man thinks that all he has is merely this temporary, material life, then all these offenders and offenses have spoiled nothing but his own life. So, you’ve got nothing else!

“And that’s it, your offender is your worst enemy, as he distorted everything you had,” batiushka said. “This is truly a great tragedy. Without spiritual attitude, it brings a lot of pain and it’s really hard. It is also impossible to comprehend, for example, how Christ said as He was nailed to a cross: *Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do*. Man can’t even perceive such thing. How can you say this in such a situation!

If such things were committed against you or your loved ones, you would have been saying and doing something completely different. But this is precisely because man is fixated on time and this life of ours. As if it’s the only wealth has. He never extends his gaze beyond that, to eternity. And this is it, the end…”

“**A little taste of what it will**

**be like in the Kingdom of Heaven”**

I was listening to Fr. Evgeniy and thinking, but this actually has to do with everything! If we consider temporary life to be our key asset, where eternity is something above and beyond our values, it will break us. For example, you have a disabled child and you think it’s the end of everything. Your career didn’t work out as you imagined—it’s the end of the game, just as when your loved one dies. A serious illness—horror and panic.

It is obvious that we are fleshly people and we have fleshly feelings, so it is normal for us to feel pain and fear. But if we knew but, most importantly, if we believed with our heart and our soul that this is not the end, it would make us feel better. And we wouldn’t do many of those things we typically do. We will perceive everything differently.

Someone wrote to me recently:

“Not every woman is capable of raising a child with the Down syndrome. That’s why it’s her choice, whether to have an abortion or not.”

And this is exactly how people think when their life is limited to their earthly time. Because, they say, we are supposed to spend this time in comfort and joy. “We only have one life! Unwind!” But when eternity is looming and you cannot cancel it or avoid it, you look at things quite differently...

“When man discovers faith, goes to church, and prays, it turns out that the Lord relieves him from all these things that bind him in earthly life,” continued Father Evgeniy. “It liberates him. And this freedom brings peace and silence to his soul. It comes from God, not from man. It’s because we can’t overcome our passions by ourselves. It comes with God, as He bestows it upon us. Not right away, of course… That son had been going to church for ten years, yet he still couldn’t do anything with himself. Or that’s what he thought. However, he was able to gradually reconsider his own life. First in his mind, and later, prayer cleansed his heart bit by bit. Over time, as the grace of God was acting, working inside him… And then the man begins to notice his weaknesses. That’s when he begins stop judging others’ weaknesses.

You know how this happens. As a child, you thought: “I will never treat my children the way my mother treats me.” And then, once you have your own kids, you may act just the same with them. You could yell or hurt them. Or even worse… Not because you are a bad person, but simply because you are weak. And then the Lord suddenly grants you a revelation through some situation in your life. Twenty years later this man suddenly longs to pray for those who had offended him. His desire is sincere—with pity and compassion. So he begins to pray. Through this prayer comes comfort to him who was offended, but now he also lets go of the offenses of him who gave offense. Yes, precisely so! But all this can be made possible through repentance. With repentance comes the mercy of God. And God gives us an understanding of what it is like, to experience the same event with and without Him. With Him comes grace, inner silence, desire to do good to everyone, and encompassing spiritual joy. When there is grace, you feel how a disease gradually disappears. But, in the absence of grace—there is nothing else but pain, offenses, and passions. It is like a prison. But if the Lord in His mercy, bestows upon us a drop of His grace, we can feel, at least for a moment, what it will be like in the Kingdom of Heaven. Where there is no place for passions, evil, or illnesses...

“**It’s no use to do things that are evil in nature”**

I was just finishing writing this story when Father Evgeniy called again. Probably, all of that got him thinking about those things. “I'm in a philosophical mood right now,” he wrote to me later, clearly embarrassed.

>**Revenge will never bring satisfaction to a man**

“You know, many people say: “There is a wonderful dish called revenge,” or “revenge is a dish that should be served cold,” and other sayings about this feeling. But, in truth, revenge will never satisfy a man. Even if he avenges his offense, nothing good will ever happen in his soul. Where there is revenge, there is no grace. That’s why the Lord says, *Vengeance is mine: I will repay!* I will judge, but you keep out of this... Because it will do you no good.” You know, I also thought about my father… I was five when he was put in jail. My dad was a really kind soul, but he'd been drinking since his teens. He hit someone while drunk, and that guy went and called the police, leaving his suitcase at the scene of the crime. So, it was interpreted as a “mugging.” My father was sentenced to eight years, but he served six. He got out of prison and was gone six years later. However, during his time in prison, he missed his family terribly and reconsidered a lot of things in life. He wanted to have a normal life and tried his best. He worked and took care of our upbringing—he baptized us. Not everyone in our family was baptized. He was the first in our family who spoke with a priest and brought a prayer book into our house. Sadly, he never received the Holy Communion... His soul was drawn to God, but he couldn’t give up drinking. He tried to fight it, but this plague would invariably prevail over him. His drinking spree could last for two weeks at a time. And during this time, there were always enormous scandals in our house. I resented him and felt angry. Everyone else just took it as a given, but we were forever in a mess. Ultimately, all these scandals were useless. Now I understand that we shouldn’t have fought all the time, but should have risen to the task as a family. We should have supported him so that he wouldn’t fall into sin again, taken pity on him, and prayed. Even if it didn’t change anything, we would have lived those six years without arguments.

What did those arguments change? Nothing.

He was already feeling down. As for me, I am feeling down now. I feel even more guilt towards him than he did towards me. So, you look at this temporary life of ours and realize that there’s no use doing things that are inherently evil. To seek revenge, feel resentment or hate someone…

Interestingly, I was writing this article in a cafe. I took my Masha to the kindergarten and got down to writing. I also listened to batiushka’s voice messages while there. Through the speaker. At a table not far from me sat a young man, drinking coffee. I guess he overheard those messages, because when he was about to leave, he said to me, “I’m going to call my father today. It's been twelve years since he abandoned us. He tried to speak to me afterwards, but I didn’t want to. I resented him. Thank you!”

Why thank me? “The Lord arranges ever-so-wisely that the events in the lives of some people don’t end with them, but deliver certain spiritual benefit to others, complete strangers unknown to them.” How about that?

We’ve been through a lot together, and I’ve always considered her someone I could count on. She’s also been open about struggling financially here and there, so I’ve tried to be supportive when I can — whether that’s buying her a coffee, covering a meal, or just being there emotionally.
Last week, she texted me asking if she could borrow $1000. She said it was urgent and that she’d pay me back in a few weeks when she got her next paycheck. Naturally, I assumed it was for rent, groceries, or something essential, so I asked what the money was for.
She told me it was for a tattoo. Not even one she had booked already. Just one she had been wanting for a while and wanted to get before a certain artist left town. I paused for a second because I wasn’t expecting that at all. I told her I didn’t feel comfortable loaning money right now, especially for something that, to me, didn’t seem like a necessity. I explained that I’m also trying to manage my own budget, and while I respect that it’s something meaningful to her, I just couldn’t justify giving that amount for something non-essential.
She didn’t take it well. She said I was being judgmental and unsupportive, and that I had no right to decide what is or isn’t important to her. She said it’s something that helps her feel in control of her body and is tied to her mental health, and that a “real friend” would understand that. I told her I do support her in ways I can, but financial support,  especially for things outside of survival needs,  is not something I’m in a position to give right now.
Since then, shes been cold toward me. She hasn’t responded to my messages much, and she posted something vague on social media about “friends who act supportive until it actually costs them something.”
Now I’m starting to feel a bit guilty. I don’t want to diminish what something means to her, but I also feel like I have the right to say no without being made to feel like a bad person.
AITA for refusing to loan her money for something I personally see as a want, even if she says it’s important to her?",6,1743054060.0,AmItheAsshole,10,1.0,False

Spring is on it's way and my 4 month baby girl is finally strong enough to go camping.

[Snow peaked \(pun intended\) Mt. Fuji glowing at dusk](https://preview.redd.it/e7vjfigwr5re1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b7ad9b23902ec4df9fbb094a3e18a3142448633)

It was a still too cold out at 6°C to use a tarp so I went with my kerosene heater and LSLP tent since it has full skirts. 2 nights out on weekdays made it easy to secure my favorite spot at Lake Tanuki in Shizuoka. 

[It's a lot to set up with no help](https://preview.redd.it/375ptvsms5re1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d7997d7d60ff5a69b8c129ed626c1c5f431b04de)

  
This campsite has is no cars allowed in the campgrounds, so the biggest challenge was carting in the gear and setting up solo. Thankfully I didn't have to take care of my girls at all during the full 3.5 hour setup. New in the camping collection after 7 months away from camping were 2 Renewed Bamboo IGT Sliding Extension Long, IGT Utensil holder, Zigle 0.5 unit grill, Camping Moon fire starter torch, EcoFlow Delta 2, and a XGIMI Halo+projector. 

  
While video time for kids while camping isn't ideal, there are those times like when cooking when it is inevitable. I think reflected light is probably better on the eyes vs. emitted light from tablets for kids. So this XGIMI Halo+ (new)  projector is internal battery powered, compact and bright enough for my needs. I found it best to project from inside the inner room tent onto the front wall.   


[This was daytime so the XGIMI Halo + was plugged into the Delta 2 for max brightness](https://preview.redd.it/wtpr4bg2x5re1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=206f253c375f9d80d1abae92f2bfdb3d6b7bf172)

[Even viewing through the mesh screen, it looks nice enough for viewing Bluey from the front, even though it's back projected from inside the inner room tent. Doesn't need to be 4K when camping. Note my double DIY Snow Peak Takudo burning extra hot unchecked. ](https://preview.redd.it/y93s060oy5re1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f36d665416a72373f2c8ea4beb650fc0df7b0ab1)

I also used the Zigle 0.5 unit for grilling as well as a fire pit since it was too cold outside the tent for baby for a Takibi.

[Great for thin meats like yakiniku since grill height isn't adjustable and the charcoal is so close to the grill. Need to make a cool zone for anything thicker. Clean up was so much easier fpr this than a Takibi Large. ](https://preview.redd.it/9kwv76s7y5re1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d519b546cb8afb038ffe4ba102f458ce5dfc14bf)



[My DIY mini-Zutto fire pit using the Zigle and Camping Moon torch was a half-fail. It works but just not as spread out a flame as I had hoped. In this picture projecting on the side wall of the tent but wasn't the best idea. Probably irked some neighbors they can see the projection clearly too. Oops. ](https://preview.redd.it/ef3md7dhz5re1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e22de12e76c9272678eba4179463668d1f2ca5a)

[I'm no chef. But when Mom has a baby strapped to her. It's more about sustenance. Breakfast croissants and Taiwanese scallion pancakes. ](https://preview.redd.it/x732xuke06re1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a649cdf10f0edc3b1981218ae0aa3ec4bbf1ecd6)

  
I missed camping so much. With a 4 month old baby in tow it sure does change things up a little Clean up took 4 hours since I had to do everything solo. But still so worth it. 

[For me this is camp breakfast heaven. Coffee + breakfast mini croissants.](https://preview.redd.it/4zs4d2x506re1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b4958f307f05126b3b8f5f8175eb8af2abec306b)

1. The Floating City – A Homebrew High Fantasy Setting  
Above the world, suspended by ancient magics and arcane engines, lies a magnificent floating city -- a hub of scholars, spellcasters, and political intrigue. Grand spires reach toward the heavens, skyships dock at gilded ports, and every corner of the city hums with raw magical energy. But for all its majesty, life here is not without peril. Secrets lurk behind enchanted doors, and power hungry factions war in the shadows.  
🔹 Hooks:  
‣Apprenticeship Bonds: Our characters are fellow apprentices under the same master, forced to work together on perilous magical assignments (or just stuck running tedious errands).  
‣Master & Apprentice: You play as my character’s master, arranging the trials of magical training while uncovering the city’s hidden dangers.

  
2. Shadows Over the City – A Supernatural Noir Mystery  
A city that never sleeps, where neon signs flicker over rain-slick streets and something ancient stirs beneath the surface. Here, the mundane and the supernatural intertwine. Witches run coffee shops, ghosts haunt abandoned subway tunnels, and hedge mages scrape by solving problems the police won’t touch. But lately, something is off. Nightmares plague the magically attuned, strange figures watch from alleyways, and an unnatural hunger creeps through the bones of the city.  
🔹 Hooks:  
‣Private Eye & Client: My character, a private investigator and hedge mage, takes on your character’s case. Maybe you’re a normal person caught in something beyond your understanding, or a fellow supernatural looking for answers.  
‣Alchemist in Trouble: My character, a socially awkward alchemist, finds themselves in over their head. Strange disappearances, things creeping in the night, and an ancient force whispering from the shadows.  
  


3. A World Without Limits – Kitchen Sink Fantasy  
A homebrew setting where just about anything goes. Martial artists who can punch through mountains, alchemists who blend magic with cutting-edge science, mecha knights battling dragon warlords, and gun-slinging wizards hunting cosmic horrors. Inspired by settings like Dragon Ball Z, which takes elements of a futuristic and modern world and throws in martial arts, mechas, dinosaurs and aliens. And like World of Warcraft, which takes high fantasy and throws in guns, tanks and space traveling goats.  
🔹 Hooks:  
‣Wildcard Adventures: Anything from classic fantasy quests to cyberpunk intrigue. Whether it’s sky pirates raiding, wandering fighters clashing in an interdimensional tournament, or eldritch horrors lurking beneath the neon glow of a mega-city. If you can dream it, we can play it!  
‣The Floating City or Supernatural Noir also fit within this setting, blending magic, technology, and the unknown in unexpected ways.



📜 What I’m Looking For:

✔️ Literate to advanced writing style (multi-paragraph responses preferred).  
✔️ A love for worldbuilding and character-driven narratives.  
✔️ Long-term RP with a partner who enjoys plotting and collaborative storytelling.  
✔️ OCs only, no canon characters from existing franchises.  
✔️ Interconnected worlds, I’d love to build a larger universe with multiple characters and intertwining stories.  
✔️ The older the better. 21+ player and character is required, but bonus points for anyone older!



📜 What I'm not looking for:

❌ Romance focused plot lines. It’s kind of surprising how almost every RP ad is romance focused. While I’m not completely against a romance forming between characters, I do not want that to be the focus of a story. B or C plot at best.  
❌ On the off chance romance does happen, I am strictly fade to black.  
❌ Inconsiderate writing partners. I’m old, as an old man I have a lot of responsibilities. I just cannot sit in front of a computer all day like I used to (unfortunately!). So I just ask that my time is respected.",1,1743053927.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

Hey there, traders! I’m diving into the market today to bring you my top 10 high-risk, fast-growing stock picks for March 26, 2025. These stocks have been filtered for strong three-day momentum and span multiple sectors, offering a mix of growth potential amid a tricky market backdrop. Before we get to the picks, let’s break down the current market trends and performance across stocks, cryptocurrencies, commodities, currencies, and indexes. Buckle up—this is going to be a detailed ride!

---

### **Market Overview**

#### **Stock Market: Bearish Sentiment Prevails**
The stock market is feeling the heat. The S&P 500 closed at 5712.20, down from 5776.65, the Dow Jones fell to 42454.79 from 42587.50, and the Nasdaq took a bigger hit, dropping to 17899.02 from 18271.86. That’s a clear bearish signal, with declines driven by tariff uncertainties and tech sector weakness. Trump’s announcement of 25% tariffs on foreign-made vehicles has rattled investors, hitting automakers and tech stocks hard. Japanese automakers like Nissan and Honda saw sharp drops, and Tesla’s Elon Musk called the tariff impact “significant” for his company. Despite some bright spots—like M&A activity (e.g., KKR eyeing Topcon) and earnings beats from Steelcase (+11%) and Petco (+13.5%)—the tariff overhang is casting a long shadow.

#### **Cryptocurrency: Cautious Vibes**
Bitcoin slipped to $86,573.34 from $88,212.12, reflecting a bearish lean in the crypto space. Over the past 30 days, BTC has been volatile, peaking near $95,043 on March 2 before pulling back. Whales are reportedly hoarding, which could tighten supply, but tariff fears and market jitters are keeping sentiment cautious. Positive news like Fidelity testing a stablecoin and Trump’s SEC pick promising crypto-friendly rules haven’t been enough to lift the mood. GameStop’s Bitcoin treasury move sparked a 14% premarket jump, though it later faded after a convertible notes offering.

#### **Commodities: Mixed Signals**
- **Gold**: Dipped to $3022.70 from $3025.00, a slight pullback after hitting $3065.20 on March 20. Goldman Sachs raised its 2025 forecast to $3,300/oz, but today’s neutral-to-bearish tone suggests profit-taking amid tariff noise.
- **Oil**: Edged up slightly, supported by a surprise drop in US crude inventories and supply risks from Venezuela and Russia-Ukraine tensions. However, tariff uncertainties are muddying the outlook, keeping sentiment mixed.

#### **Currencies: Dollar Strengthens**
The EUR/USD pair fell to 1.075384 from 1.079797, with the dollar hitting a three-week high. Over the past month, the euro has weakened from a high of 1.094931 on March 18, reflecting market unease and a flight to safety as bond yields rise.

#### **Indexes and Bond Yields: Unease Grows**
The 10-year Treasury yield ticked up to 4.338% from 4.307%, signaling market nervousness. Looking at the past 30 days, yields have climbed from 4.180% on March 3, suggesting investors are bracing for volatility. Globally, Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.73% to 38027.29, buoyed by domestic gains, while the UK’s FTSE edged up 0.28%. However, the broader trend across US indexes remains downward, with tariff fears dominating.

### **Top 10 Stock Picks**

Given the bearish market vibe and tariff headwinds, I’ve picked stocks with strong three-day momentum that also show resilience or limited direct exposure to the auto tariff fallout. These are high-risk, high-reward plays, so let’s dive into the reasoning for each.

1. **AZEK (The AZEK Company Inc.) - Industrials**  
   - **Why?**: AZEK’s 3-day momentum of 17.98% crushes its sector average of 2.69%. This building products company benefits from strong revenue growth (19%) and potential M&A tailwinds in industrials. Its high forward P/E of 35.64 reflects growth expectations, not tariff woes.

2. **THC (Tenet Healthcare Corporation) - Healthcare**  
   - **Why?**: With a 3-day momentum of 7.99% versus a sector average of 1.02%, THC shines. Its low forward P/E of 11.61 and 44% earnings growth make it a bargain in healthcare—a sector insulated from auto tariffs.

3. **CVNA (Carvana Co.) - Consumer Cyclical**  
   - **Why?**: CVNA’s 7.29% momentum beats its sector’s 3.71%. As an online car retailer, it’s less exposed to import tariffs than manufacturers. Strong revenue growth (46%) offsets its high forward P/E of 87.18.

4. **SAIA (Saia, Inc.) - Industrials**  
   - **Why?**: SAIA’s 7.03% momentum tops the sector average of 2.69%. This transportation play offers a reasonable forward P/E of 23.62 and modest revenue growth (5%), making it a steady pick despite tariff noise.

5. **EAT (Brinker International, Inc.) - Consumer Cyclical**  
   - **Why?**: EAT’s 6.44% momentum outpaces its sector’s 3.71%. This restaurant chain boasts a forward P/E of 24.86 and a whopping 178% earnings growth—untouched by auto tariffs.

6. **FTAI (FTAI Aviation Ltd.) - Industrials**  
   - **Why?**: FTAI’s 6.31% momentum beats the sector average. With a forward P/E of 23.22 and 60% revenue growth, this aviation leasing firm shows strength, though it could face indirect tariff ripples.

7. **CELH (Celsius Holdings, Inc.) - Consumer Defensive**  
   - **Why?**: CELH’s 5.98% momentum matches its sector average, but its defensive nature offers stability. A forward P/E of 35.61 signals growth in a resilient category amid economic uncertainty.

8. **DKS (Dick's Sporting Goods Inc) - Consumer Cyclical**  
   - **Why?**: DKS posts a 5.85% momentum versus 3.71% for its sector. With a low forward P/E of 13.96 and modest growth, this sporting goods retailer is a value play with minimal tariff exposure.

9. **BROS (Dutch Bros Inc.) - Consumer Cyclical**  
   - **Why?**: BROS’ 5.10% momentum edges out the sector average. This coffee chain’s high forward P/E of 127.35 reflects growth potential, and it’s far removed from auto tariff risks.

10. **ALV (Autoliv, Inc.) - Consumer Cyclical**  
    - **Why?**: ALV’s 6.34% momentum beats its sector average. Its low forward P/E of 9.32 and 15% earnings growth are compelling, but as an auto parts supplier, it’s at risk from tariffs—consider this a cautious pick.

I've always been super sensitive to caffeine, all my life. I could only drink decaf coffee. Regular coffee, just one cup, would make me very uncomfortable, very jittery, for hours. Just one cup before noon would mean a very stressful mostly sleepless night.

Enter Mounjaro ..... I've been on MJ now for 18 months. I'm at goal and on maintenance. My main side effect all along has been fatigue, and I still have this most days, unfortunately. I started drinking ""real"" coffee soon after starting MJ because of the exhaustion. Coffee is the ""food"" I most look forward to now. And weirdly, the caffeine barely affects me. I can drink several cups of strong coffee each day and never feel jittery. I can drink a cup late in the afternoon and will still sleep like a log. I wish it did give me a bit of a boost, because I could sure use it. This change occurred right from the outset, when I started my MJ treatment.

I'm wondering if MJ has changed the way my body metabolizes caffeine. Have you had a similar experience? I met someone who told me that since he started a strict keto diet about a year ago, he no longer gets the jitters from coffee--he also used to be mostly a decaf drinker because he was so sensitive to just one cup of coffee.

She was a stray and super skinny. She’s been with us for 2 years now and is an indoor outdoor cat and may I just say the sweetest baby ever. She’s super friendly and I have a tracker on her that gives me her live location. I saw she was at the front of the property we’re renting and went out to say hi and lead her back for cuddles as it was almost time for me to go to bed. 

Long story short, she had run up a 30ft tree and was screaming for help. Thank god I went out there to see her. I could hear in her meows that she was terrified and would not come down. My fiancé climbed up the tree and brought her down. Not a scratch on her. She also walked back to the house as normal and happily ate some treats. Now she’s lounging on my coffee bar purring when I pet her and looking out the window. 

However, I know she got some tree sap on her. I got it all off her belly and paws, but now I’m sitting and having an anxiety attack about her wellbeing. I know in my heart and gut that she’s okay, but my mind is telling me to worry. I love this girl to death. Am I over worrying?

1jkwjil,https://www.reddit.com/r/caseyarcade/comments/1jkwjil/physical_dangers_of_multidevice_authentication/,Physical Dangers of Multi-Device Authentication,"Picture this: you're sitting at a cozy coffee shop, enjoying a moment of relaxation while working on your laptop. You decide to grab another cup of coffee, so you take a few steps to the counter, leaving your laptop behind but securely locked. Meanwhile, your phone, resting in your pocket, is set up to unlock your tablet and laptop instantly. In that brief moment, the person sitting next to you sees the opportunity. With a quick tap, they open your laptop's home screen and walk out with your computer. No hacking, no technical skills, no hours of breaking in—just sheer convenience turned against you.

This is the new face of computer theft in the age of multi-device authentication. While this technology provides seamless protection for the likes of Google and Yahoo, it inadvertently exposes everyday users to new vulnerabilities. Gone are the days when criminals needed advanced computer knowledge or sophisticated techniques to break into parts your digital world. Now, they only need to be aware of these convenient features and seize the moment when you let your guard down.

Multi-device authentication, designed to enhance security, ironically creates a physical security risk. By carrying multiple devices that can unlock each other, you signal to potential thieves that you possess interconnected gadgets. A simple glance can reveal your head dropping to check your phone, touching your tablet, and typing on your computer. This behavior pattern is enough for an observant criminal to target you and what they get is access to many accounts at the same time.

Once the thief gains access to your laptop, they don't just get into one account; they gain entry to a web of interconnected accounts. This interconnectedness means they can easily reset passwords, change security settings, and spam your contacts. 

With multiple accounts from the same holder, a criminal can convincingly impersonate you, initiating a cascade of identity theft. They can verify your identity across different platforms, making it increasingly difficult for you to reclaim control. In a matter of minutes, your digital life can be turned upside down, forcing you to backtrack and mitigate the damage.

The convenience of multi-device authentication is a double-edged sword. While it offers enhanced protection for major tech companies, it also opens up new avenues for physical theft and instant identity fraud for individual users. It's crucial to be aware of these possession-based tokens as they can present risks and take additional precautions and of course worth repeating keeping a close eye on your devices in public places.

1jkwh4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/childrensbooks/comments/1jkwh4b/settling_in_to_a_book/,Settling in to a book,"I'm mostly grateful for the craziness of my days.

Ever since I became a parent and especially after becoming a parent of two, my days have become a blur. My morning begins around 6:45 AM to the clanging of a stainless steel water bottle clattering against the walls and doors as my son commutes from his bedroom to mine. The entire household is awake now and organized chaos ensues. Danielle and I throw together bento lunches for the kids and get them dressed. We try to be patient with our 3 year old who obliges by putting on her top and jacket but insists on being garment-free from the waist down. Meanwhile we keep a close eye on the 6 year old lest he wander away from his breakfast to start a jigsaw puzzle from which it would be impossible to pull him away. All the while, Danielle and I can only think of taking a sip of the now room-temperature coffee sitting on the countertop.

The sound of the garage door closing provides a moment of relief. I can finally sit down in front of my `tasks` file to take stock of the day ahead. I give a fleeting thought to Danielle. I hope she makes it to work on time after dropping off the kids at school.

With a sense of accomplishment, I mark a task complete with `Ctrl-c` `Ctrl-t` but get startled by a noise—It is the garage door again. *Darn it, where did the day go? I'm still in my PJs*. I rush downstairs to greet the rustle of footsteps coming my way. ""How was your day!?"" I ask. My son rushes past, oblivious to my question and thankfully not noticing my unchanged attire, and heads straight to play Rush Hour. My daughter rushes toward me head first like a ram going into battle. ""OUT-STANDING, OUT-SITTING AND OUT-NAPPING.. CAN YOU SPIN ME AROUND?"", is her usual response at 90 dB. Porter Danielle, lugging the kids' backpacks, snack containers, jackets and her handbag, walks by grumbling about the kids not bothering to carry up any of their belongings. ""What's for dinner?"" she asks. I take a deep breath and desperately hope for the next three hours pass as quickly as possible.

We prepare dinner, I sit down with my son to do his homework, and Danielle entertains our daughter while trying to coax her into helping set the dinner table. My anxiety climbs at the dinner table as I watch a mountain of crumbs form around my son. I've solved many problems in my professional engineering life but getting my son to eat above his plate remains insurmountable. With dinner done, Danielle announces bath time. The kids set off on The Great Trek—the 14 steps between the dinner table and their bathroom—which feels like the longest hike ever, where even a stray piece of lint in the carpet deserves careful exploration. While the journey to the bathtub is long, the bath itself lasts a mere 5 seconds as the kids compete to be the first to finish. A trail of destruction remains—towels strewn, an ouchie from the scuffle, a precariously slippery floor from the bath water and who-knows-what-else.

The kids get dressed, brush their teeth, and we muster the last of our energy engaging them in a chase as they try, as they do every night, to evade our lotion-laden fingers. With that battle out of the way, the kids pick up some books and nestle in their beds. Danielle follows our daughter and I, our son. My son cozies up next to me on the bed, his legs tucked under his blankets, my arm around him. I open the first book.

This is the magical moment.

Everything settles into place. The bustle of the day fizzles out. My body and mind suddenly feel warm and relaxed. Previously narrowly focused, his ears are suddenly fully receptive to the world that the book is about to unveil. We take turns reading aloud. He smiles when I dramatize my reading. He tries to do the same when he reads. I feel so connected to him. I don't want the day to end.

I recently acquired a Rocket Cellini and this forum has been really helpful dialing in my setup.

After a morning of pulling a few great shots without issue, I decided to do a backflush with Caffeto since it had been a couple of weeks since the last time. Since then, my machine has been having odd pressure issues. When pulling a shot, the machine will take more time than usual to get to four bars, at which point coffee starts flowing, then it chugs its way up to nine bars while coffee flows rapidly. When I pull with the blind basket, it will get up to 9 bars, but when I drop the lever, the pressure on the backflush is substantial. Way more than before, to the point of splashing. Both after pulling shots and using the blind basket, the pressure will sit anywhere from 4-8 bars, until I lift the lever slightly then the pressure immediately releases. I drop the lever completely and more water releases from the drain chamber.

I have disassembled the entire group head and lubed everything with Molykote. Valves were somewhat scaled (I purchased this machine a month ago and the previous owner's upkeep left something to be desired), but the seals were all in good shape, just needed lubricating. There was some scale build up in the grouphead so I ran a descale of the machine as well with a 3% citric acid which appears to have done a fine job. No more scale remains on any of the valves or pieces I can access in the group head. I also opened up the machine to check the lines and they were free of debris.

From the Googling I've done, perhaps this could be a pump or pressurestat issue. The pump sounds like it is chugging some to me, but maybe this is because of another issue. Given the pressure release issue with the lever and drain chamber, I am wondering if this is a valve issue in the group head? I did also notice my lever was sounding a bit squeaky prior to this happening, but that may be a coincidence or merely a lubrication issue.

I am comfortable doing many of these repairs myself, but I am having difficulty troubleshooting and do not want to change parts I don't have to. Before I take this somewhere for a diagnostic, I'd appreciate any insights you fine folks may have.

Here is a link to a video of the issue at hand. I took this video using a blind basket at the end of a second Caffeto flush. My friend suggested that I try a second flush to see if it remedies the issue caused by the first backflush.

[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UJnnbUwqgVs](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UJnnbUwqgVs)

Here is a video of me pulling a shot. In this video, the shot actually gets up to nine bars, when before cleaning/lubing/descaling/and a second caffeto rinse it was only getting to 5-7 bars. Still, the lever pressure issue is at play.

After that night, he followed me on instagram and he sent me a message regarding on how i find the exams of physiology, biochem, and anatomy. 

After few days, we decided to go on a coffee date. And talk and talk and talk. After a week, I was sick that time, he took care of me. And I decided to be official with him. 

He treated me so well. Caring, kind, a total man of my dreams. Fast forward to January, I saw a notification on his phone. Someone sent him a message saying “Miss na kita. Chat ka kapag di ka na busy.” I didnt bother to tel it to him right away, but i felt that something is wrong. After few days, i told me about it, he said it was just someone who he flirted with months ago before we started dating. I trust him and didn’t think about it anymore. 

After a week, I accompanied him to go to the dentist, I borrowed his iPad and saw he was still talking to him in a very malicious way. I kept it to myself again.

That’s the time when I knew he was using GRINDR and he admitted that he had been meeting with people there. I couldn’t even move nor even say a thing. I couldn’t eat the food in front of me.

He was sorry. And he said he dont want me to leave. So i gave him another chance because i love him that much. 

After that night, whenever im not with him, I am feeling anxious. It didnt get ang better. And after 2 months, I borrowed his phone and saw that he sent a message to a guy saying that the guy was handsome. But the guy seems not interested. Also, i saw messages from a massager that he is setting an appointment for a massage. But it is kn a hotel room service. No extra service was mentioned but i dont know. How could I trust him?

"" The N0RB0T Model fifteen. Look at that face. You cannot be afraid of such a face. It gardens, it helps around the house, it even brews coffee!"" The figure in the cloak announces dramatically. ""You see, why we are your best friends for improving your image. And with the device you sent, we have had great progress working on what we deem Project Robot Heart.""

""Mister Leemo"" A Techno Union Representative asks, adjusting his voice modulator.

""I am Reemo Rammer."" The figure corrects. ""I run the robotics division. Easy mistake.""

""Yes. Sorry. What have you come up with? The Advanced unit we sent, was....""

Reemo holds up a hand as they enter a secured hallway. ""Very expensive, you do not wish to upgrade all your droids with his hardware. But, we have been working diligently, our Happy Nifty N0RB0Ts carry a similar computer card as yours, similar power, maybe less. Yet they are beloved!"" He states, conveniently leaving out the lawsuits. ""We have a way to make them friendlier, and improve their security features. However, to do so would take up more limited harddrive space and decrease performance."" He pauses as they walk in front of a deactivated TSB-01 Unit. Wires run into its head and large screens display a myriad of information as technicians type away on computers. ""We realized, that recording it to include emotions, was a far more efficient way to handle the list, based upon the advanced unit you delivered to us. Fear, joy, pain, pleasure. These were easy to code into its existing programming and thus took up far less computation power."" Reemo motions at one of the screens.

""What good is fear, for a unit that is supposed to be fearless?"" Another Techno Union representative asks.

""You want the droids to seem, friendly. Approachable, these are human things. They will still follow orders, but they will check it, they will hesitate if the order seems to violate Accord list directives, and these Accord directives are built into the droid's emotions. To remove them shuts down the droid as so many actions are tied to these emotions. However, well, we had to remove the DSL list, because for future proofing that list may change. Instead we built in basic morality, then we added a no target list that can be adjusted, but ONLY"" points at the wires ""Via landline. So you can adjust it, but it is not something you can sneak into the programming on the field, and if modified, the first moment the droid is in range of an active transmitter it will relay the change to you. It will also still hesitate as well to shoot anyone who was on the list and then removed, requiring confirmation before taking the shot.""

""But they still could take the shot?""

""With confirmation, and with the person having been removed from the target list. in the event that they encounter someone on the target list they will be afraid to confront them and actively disengage. Now the problem is."" He walks over and taps the droid's head. ""This computer is powerful, but is limited. All tests show that with or without our Friendly programming, the unit struggles to be nothing more than cannon fodder. However, we came up with a solution. Loadsharing!"" He gestures to yet another screen. ""If, rather than having all their combat coordination programming aboard each unit, you instead offloaded most of it to a Command and Control Computer that was nearby and broadcasting, you could do almost anything with the units, as the CCC could be as powerful as you need to make them do anything!""

""I will need to consult with Manager Likesh.""

""Of course. Take your time.""

The Techo Union representative adjusts his dials. ""Thank you.... What is that there? Is that?.....""

""An old Xim War Robot. Far less capable than your units, slow, clunky"" Reemo states walking over to it. ""We are not fans of war robots, yet the needs of war, well it is up to practicality, not aesthetics. And this is no longer a practical design.  We will have to upgrade, for while we don't want to build war droids, better to have the plans and no need, than need and not have.

1jkw7qp,https://i.redd.it/97ne518ix5re1.jpeg,FREE HOLLAND'S SLAVE ISLANDS. Joseph B. Bowles 1914.,"Repost because inaccurate date. This article was published nationwide in numerous newspapers in the America at that time.


Text transcribed by DeepSeek :



FREE HOLLAND'S SLAVE ISLANDS  


Batavia, Java— Kechil which was only six years old. Slight of figure and short of stature, she appeared even younger. Her name, in Javanese meaning ""Tiny One,"" had been given her at birth, not because she was small, but as an expression of affection. The Javanese, a smiling, bright-eyed, brown-skinned race, are devoted to their children. 


Indeed, when Sina, Kechil's oldest sister, the firstborn of the family, came to the Java home, her parents' names were changed, according to ancient native custom, and they were thereafter known by words that mean in our blunt English Pa Sina and Ma Sina. The baby is an important personage in the Javanese home life.  



**Practical Peonage Enforced.** When Kechil went to work in the sorting room of the big tea estate she was scarcely five years old. She was not needed at the estate, however. The Dutch rulers of the East Indies archipelago have a century-old system of impressed labor which, technically abolished in some islands and for some purposes, exists in actual practice almost unchanged. Nowhere in the Dutch Archipelago is there a child-labor law. Nowhere is there compulsory school attendance. Why seek to compel attendance of children at schools when there are not schools enough provided to accommodate those who go voluntarily? Why have a child-labor law when it would interfere with the profits of the Dutch-owned estates? The very idea seemed ridiculous to the courteous manager of the estate. As for educating girls to school—hah! That might do in Europe and of course in America, where he had heard they even sent black girls to school, and did other mad things, or possibly in Britain and the big towns, but not in the country districts, no, indeed.  



**No Protection for Laborers.**  


Nor is there a minimum wage law or any other legislation which gives protection to the native laborers, young or old, in Java. ""It isn't hard work,"" said the manager, ""this sorting of tea. The baskets with tea are kept. These handled by the young girls weigh about ten pounds. The hours are only from six in the morning until four in the afternoon, with time for lunch."" There may be a difference of opinion as to the work. To make a score holding ten pounds of tea, more or less, for ten hours a day, in a climate of tropical heat, might be regarded by some as rather hard work. In the sorting room with Kechil were many older laborers, girls and women.  



""The wages?"" replied the manager. ""We pay according to the work done. Our scale of wages is about a half cent higher than that usually paid. Some of the more skillful women can earn 60 or 80 cents a day, Dutch money (in American dollars about 50% of this).""  


Kechil, ""Tiny One"" has been working a year. She was paid the equivalent of four cents, American money, a day.  



Few more fertile countries are to be found in all the world than Java. Its inhabitants are born farmers, skilled in irrigation methods and with expert knowledge of hydraulics. Yet, living in a land where the richest harvests come with little effort, large territories are periodically visited by famines. ""The cause of this,"" said J. F. Schellema, ""has to be sought in a system of colonial conditions which made the natives raise products for the European markets by forced labor and deliver them into the government storehouses whose contents are shipped to Holland and sold at an enormous profit. This system, called after Count van den Bosch, on whose recommendation it was introduced, rescued Holland's financial difficulties, has now been abandoned, though the corvée, the villagers' unpaid service for the maintenance of roads, etc., continues as before. Even now, however, it would be too much to say that native labor, when demanded by direct or indirect pressure, always commands wages sufficient to keep body and soul together. The word 'coffee' still has an especially hateful sound in native ears, for it recalls the forced cultivation of that commodity for government purposes. But the principal food of the people, if they can afford it, is also their principal crop, and yet, for reasons closely connected with the government methods referred to, the production does not come up to the consumption.  


Java, thanks largely to the official tourist bureaus, is the best known of the islands comprising the Netherlands East Indies. It is also the best governed, the most prosperous, and the one where the most considerable effort, such as it may be, has been shown by the Dutch government for the welfare of the natives. Java has a population of 35,000,000, more than one-third the population of the United States. Six hundred to a square mile live on the island. Borneo, Sumatra, and Celebes, all islands in the Dutch archipelago, exceed Java in size. In these the conditions are even less favorable to the development of the native population.  



**Have No Political Rights.**  


The primary schools open to natives are few and inadequate, and except for a few doctors, there are no higher institutions, leaving the native wanting higher education must go to Holland. Taxation is high, particularly for the native, and the returns he receives are few indeed. He has no voice in any administration of the island's affairs. He cannot vote nor hold office of any importance.  



The Dutch government, stricter in administration in the archipelago than the Holland officials at home, has been forced to take cognizance of the awakening demand for liberty. The. Mohammedan organization though its chief aim is religious , has had some effect in disclosing conditions and urging social and political reform. Moreover, in a country where the discussion of national affairs is not merely discouraged but by law forbidden, it is hopeful to find a political society, well organized, with more than 12,000 members, the natives of various parts, the avowed purpose of which is equality before the law for all inhabitants of the islands. This society includes in its membership all classes and is doing a quiet educational work though, protest as its leaders are in the main, it comes frequently into collision with the local government. The organ of the society is the *Java Express*, edited at Bandung by H. C. Kakebecke, a Dutchman by birth, a resident of Java, but by naturalization a citizen of the United States. The *Express* is the best edited newspaper in Java, and has the largest circulation. Kechil, Sina, their father and brothers and the 35,000,000 of the same race are not without a strong advocate.  



""The object of the Indische party,"" explained Mr. Kakebecke, ""is to awaken the patriotism of all Indians for the soil that nurtures them, to create a desire for political equality in an Indian fatherland and thus prepare the way for independence."" It was this hint at possible future independence that caused the governor-general to decline to permit the incorporation of the society under the terms of law. ""The Indische party purposes,"" said Mr. Kakebecke, ""to teach the history of these people to them in order to awaken the latent national sentiments. We would abolish all special privileges that attach to race or caste. We are opposed to religious sectarianism or strife. We seek the establishment of technical schools that the natives may become skilled to do their own technical work.""  



**Robbery by Tax Collectors.**  


Conditions far worse than those which the Indische party seeks to remedy in Java exist in the other islands of the archipelago—Borneo, Sumatra, Celebes and the smaller ones. In these the native is a peon, half-savage and half-slave. The exceptions are not numerous. Take the matter of taxation in Borneo, as the one such clear example of the general rule. Let an intelligent, high-minded, patriotic Dutchman tell the story: ""I lived for some time among the primitive population in Borneo,"" he said. ""Away in the interior the different tribes of the so-called dreadful Dayaks were my helpers. Shy at first, they soon became friendly when they found that I was not after their women or monopolies but paid fair wages. One day a government tax collector came. When you and I pay taxes we get something in return—police protection, courts, jailors. These Borneo natives get nothing in return. The tax-collector kept at his work until there was not a fellow in the whole camp that had a dollar left except myself. He stripped the camp and the native village bare of everything of value. His boat carried it all down the river—as taxes. The Dyaks, who still are uncivilized and cut off their enemies' heads, when they knew of the visit of the tax-collector to any tribe, immediately attack those thus visited, knowing they will have nothing left with which to make defense. Is it strange that the tax-collector is sometimes the victim of the enraged natives? I do not blame him for his tax-collecting. The stay-at-home must have revenue, and he must produce it for them. It is a rotten system.""  



**Rebellion Mercilessly Suppressed.**  


Occasionally even the light-hearted, happy-go-lucky Javanese rebels against such treatment and there is bloodshed. The Dutch speedily and mercilessly suppress the insurrection and the outside world, so rigid is the control of the press, hears little or nothing of it. In the other islands, particularly in Sumatra and Borneo, where the natives are less gentle than in Java, there is constant strife. In Timor the natives arose in wrath the other day at the exactions and bestialities of an official and well-nigh threw the entire government of the island, half Dutch and half Portuguese, into the sea. Though there are many excellent and high-minded men in the Dutch administration of the East Indies, the system is one of exploitation primarily. It shows well on the bank books, but not in the lives of the native men and women.

Currently I am a mobile art studio that travels to people in order try things out first! (I have no business background and am learning as i go).

Anyways- been teaching recurring art classes a pretty cinsistantly to group of kids- and trying to branch out to doing some partnerships with local businesses. 
Thought of yoga studios, gyms, coffee shops perhaps etc- Around mothers day as a start to ""Drop your kid off so you can have a pamper hour while your child (age 6-12) does art enrichment class!"" Type thing.  
Basically the studio will provide a space for me to do my class while the parents can enjoy their time at whatever business I'll be partnering with. 

Since I am not sure yet of how I would partner with the company on promotions and financial terms- i wanted to get some feedback on any ideas or things I should look out for.

I'm thinking some sort of low flat fee + x% of revenue share to be on the safe side since I am not 100% how many people would be interested in it.

1) not sure HOW I should gage the flat fee & x% of revenue share.  The studios will have opportunity for potential new clients and overall positive branding image etc so they are getting ""somthing"" out of the partnership... so i wanted to see if i can find a middle ground without me having to pay alot for their space to teach the art.  (It will be min 5, max 10 kids) 

2) promoting wise- how would this work? As in- how would it be visible we are both doing it, and which side is bringing more etc? And $ we should each be putting in- should these be discussed?  

3) anything else I'm not thinking of? 

Apologies if this is a bit ambiguous,  I don't quite know what I don't know since I have no experience to learn from yet!

1jkvvt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jkvvt6/i_think_my_boyfriend_is_avoidant_and_having_an/,"I think my boyfriend is avoidant and having an emotional affair, but I feel like I’m going insane.","My (21F) boyfriend (22M) and I have been together for almost a year and a half now, but lately, I’ve been feeling deeply uneasy about our relationship. We recently took a break to focus on ourselves, but since reconnecting, I feel more anxious than ever.

The main issue is with my ex-best friend (20F).
She and I were inseparable friends, but our friendship ended badly. Without going into too much detail, she never took accountability for things she did that hurt me, would throw my vulnerabilities back in my face, and seemed to get spiteful when confronted. After cutting her off, I started realizing that she treated me as disposable while keeping my bf close—and now he refuses to let go of her, despite knowing how much she’s hurt me. Adding to that they’re best friends now, which really unnerves me.

They got close when the three of us spent time together, and he claims it’s only natural they bonded, but it feels so much deeper than that. They would constantly check in on each other, call each other best friends, and have an emotional closeness that felt like it overshadowed my place in his life. The weirdest part? She was over at his house weekly, and they would go out clubbing together without me, and in the first week of our break my bf organised for the two of them to go out clubbing together as a kind of “last hurrah” before they couldn’t hang out regularly anymore as a result of my boundaries.

He’s respecting the boundaries that i put in place that she can’t come over to his house anymore if i’m not there, and if they want to hang out it needs to be somewhere public like a coffee shop. i also told him that if he wants to meet up with her whilst clubbing that’s fine, but only do it when i’m also out clubbing with him.

I’ve tried to bring this up with my bf, but he completely shuts down whenever I do. He refuses to talk about how she acted, and acts, calling it “drama” that he doesn’t want to be involved in, and insists that he just wants to keep her in his life with boundaries. I’m also respectfully not talking to him about my feelings pertaining to her because he said the negativity is affecting his mental health. So I’ve respected his boundaries. But how can he set real boundaries when he clearly prioritises their relationship over my feelings?

When i ask where their closeness comes from, he says they see things the same way and it’s just easy to talk to her. like she sees things objectively like he does whilst i see things subjectively - his words not mine.

I also feel like he’s emotionally avoidant—he pulls away when things get difficult, only seems to enjoy me when I’m at my best, and gets overwhelmed when I express my emotions. I used to see him as my safe person, but now I feel like I have to fight for my place in his life while she just gets it without question. He tells me I’m the one he wants to spend his life with, but if he can’t promise me unwavering loyalty, I don’t see how that’s true.

I want a husband one day who is ride or die for me, just like I would be for him. My bf is fun, and we have good moments, but this isn’t the kind of partnership I want long-term.

So, am I overreacting? Is this just my anxiety making me spiral, or is this an emotional affair? How do I approach this in a way that doesn’t make me seem controlling? Because I feel like I’m going insane.

Or maybe it really is all in my head, I’m trying to control and manipulate and abuse him, and i really am the asshole.

1jkvskb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1jkvskb/decrease_in_my_appetite/,Decrease in my appetite,"(25F) I started taking my medication, Samexid, more regularly since February. About two weeks ago, I noticed a significant decrease in my appetite, especially in the mornings. As a mid-size woman, I'm already self-conscious about my body. I'm unsure if the medication is suppressing my appetite or if I'm subconsciously not eating to lose weight. I know that less appetite is a secondary effect of the medication.

Additionally, I'm struggling to consume the minimum necessary for my daily nutritional intake. Lately, I've only been able to stomach liquids in the morning, like yogurt, coffee with milk, and fruit compote. I'm getting zero protein.

Did this happened to you before? What did you do? What do you thing about my situation?
