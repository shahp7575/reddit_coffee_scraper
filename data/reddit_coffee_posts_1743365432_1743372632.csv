1jnnww9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1jnnww9/rapid_onset_of_constant_upper_abdominal_pain_and/,Rapid onset of constant upper abdominal pain and inflammation/brunner gland hyperplasia in duodenum over the course of 7 months. Have had a slew of tests done and still no answers or relief from symptoms.,"31F, no smoking or drug use, currently no alcohol or coffee/caffeinated beverages.

About one year ago I started waking up around the same time in the early morning 4-6am with upper abdominal pain that felt like the area right below my breast bone was in a vice and on fire. Became more frequent so I started seeing a GI. In summer 2024 they did an endoscopy, colonoscopy, abdominal ultrasound, abdominal MRI, and a HIDA scan. Bloodwork and stool tests. Everything came back normal except for mild gastritis in my stomach.

During this time, I tried Carafate, Pepcid, a low acid, and a low fat diet. Nothing helped with this upper abdominal pain that increased in frequency. Now, my stomach hurts almost 24/7. Sometimes it'll flare up extra bad for a few days and be unbearable, but there's no obvious trigger that I've been able to identify. I tried cutting out gluten and dairy and it didn't help.

In 2025, I found a new GI and they redid an endoscopy recently and found new inflammation and brunner gland hyperplasia in my duodenum that wasn't there 7 months ago. They also found some bile in my stomach. First they thought Celiac disease but all my bloodwork came back normal again and there was no villous atrophy. 

There's not a lot of information about this kind of stuff online and I'm at a loss. I could feel myself getting worse all this time and the new issues in my duodenum make sense because that's the exact area where all this discomfort stems from. This is ruining my life. I've lost weight and can't put it back on, am constantly nauseous and uncomfortable. Seriously nothing helps with these symptoms. I even did 6 months of therapy and am trying anxiety medication in case it's psychosomatic but I really don't think it is.

What could be causing this rapid onset of inflammation? I have no history of GI issues, IBS, IBD, or allergies of any kind.

1jnnvjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1jnnvjt/extremely_frustrated_at_roommate_paying_rent/,Extremely frustrated at roommate paying rent technically on time,"So my roommate has lived with me for three years. We recently moved, partially because my old landlords were doing repairs, but also because those same landlords were becoming increasingly hostile toward us. The move was difficult and I had to leave stuff behind because they locked me out (I'm not pursuing any legal recourse, but I have evidence saved if they ever pursued against me, if that makes sense)

Anyway the new apartment is great but the landlord, who doesn't live there, is a bit overbearing. She frequently visits the property and texts over little things, like someone spilled coffee in the hallway and I'm sure they were going to grab a towel to clean it but she had to text about it. Because of the old landlords I'm super nervous about this one. I do not want to fuck up.

My roommate smokes constantly and the landlord texted em to ask if he was smoking in the house. He isn't, I thought, but he admitted it was cold so he smoked in the basement. I went apeshit and he hadn't done it since but now there is a door in the basement that blocks off most of the basement which is a nuisance to me as I was planning on waking through the basement to access the backyard, since his room has the only door to the backyard (where he should have smoked!!)

He also doesn't clean at all and has left shit ont he toilet seat mor than once.

I put up with it because I can't afford to live without a roommate. I was making a great salary and he doesnt make much so he was paycheck to paycheck and I let him pay a few days late each month, since I could cover it. I also have the leas only in my name an I paid the whole security and cost of moving, so money was tight for me and I tightened my belt. Unfortunately, my company ignored my requests to stop 401(k) contributions, which I was making aggressively, for three months, and I am looking into legal options about that.


A month ago, I unexpectedly lost my job. I sat him down and told him and told him money was tight and he had to pay on time this month. He responded that he gets paid twice a month and it's not always on the last day. I told him too bad, he need to save money from his middle of the month paycheck and pay me this Friday, 3/28, so the money could clear my account.

I explained to him that I was taking hits not paying my credit cards just to make ends meet this month and he semed to understand. I reminded him on Wednesday, and he told me he could get paid early on Thursday.

I asked for a check on Friday and he told me he wouldn't be paid til Monday - which means he won't give me a check until after COB Monday, which means I won't get the money until 4/2.

I don't know what to do. I just said, whatever, and went in my room slmaming the door.

I cant live without him, like literally financially, cannot, especially now (I found a new job for a huge pay cut)

But his behavior is unacceptable.

1jnnvcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragons/comments/1jnnvcc/dragon_accounting/,Dragon Accounting,"So, this is a side-project I've been entertaining myself with for the last couple months (mostly because I love stories from the dragon's perspective, for obvious reasons, but it's so hard to find good ones ... so I decided to just start writing my own, and it's been a fun de-stresser project while moving half-way around the world, starting a new position at work, etc. etc.). I don't know how often I'll be updating this one, because I want to get back into the swing with my main story ([Retreat, Hell](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/bfrj07/retreat_hell/)), continue my other side story projects, and give To Touch the Stars a polish pass and repost, and life in general is pretty busy (the comment about moving half-way around the world was not hyperbole), but I'm really loving this story and I've got most of the second chapter already written (minus a couple particular scenes that have been giving me trouble), and I've already got big plans and a whole array of plots and antagonists both big and small.



I usually post on r/HFY, but one of the two main protagonists is a dragon, and the story largely follows the perspective of the dragon, and a human who closely interacts with the dragon. It still contains the same principles and general optimism regarding humanity that I include in all my works, but I felt it was appropriate to post it here, as well as r/HFY. I will also be posting it on RoyalRoad, and [have posted it on my Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/dragon-chapter-1-125538965?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=postshare_creator&utm_content=join_link).

As this is the first introduction to this story, I will also be deviating from my usual early release schedule, and posting it openly for everyone without any early access delays. Chapter 2 and onward will follow the same 3 day early access schedule as half-episodes of Retreat, Hell, and my other side project stories.



Now, without further ado, the story.

# Dragon Accounting - Chapter 1

“In a quarter mile, take exit fifty-two for US-11 toward I-76 Penna Turn Pike New Kingstown Middlesex.”

“-s. Larouse, once again, thank you for joining us.”

“Thank you fair ‘aveng me, Rashel, eet eez a pleasure to be hare. And please, call me Stéphane.”

“Of course –“

“Take exit fifty-two for US-11 toward I-76 Penna Turn Pike New Kingstown Middlesex, then keep right, follow signs for Carlisle Barracks and merge onto US-11 South. Keep right, follow signs for Carlisle Barracks and merge onto US-” The GPS audio cut out as Cara stabbed the voice alert mute button with a finger and a glare.

“-been six months since your husband broke the Curse of Merlin. Beyond giving the initial declaration, you have kept silent. Why speak out now?”

“Eet was a vairy chaotic time, fair all of us, and many ware unhappy wiv ze end of ze cursé, evén among ze faé. Een some ways, I was afraid of ze attenshé-on ... But mostly … I missed mon René.” The woman on the radio sighed. “Talkeng abut 'im was 'ard. But talkeng abut zesé théngs eez 'ow we move past zem, oui?”

“My condolences for the loss of your husband. I know this must be hard for you”

“Merci, Rashel. Eet eez. But talkeng abut 'im eez impairtent. Eet eez impairtént zat 'e bé remembaired as 'é tru-lee was , and zat people know why what 'e did was necezary.”

“Many have argued that “Merlin’s Curse” as it is called was created for a reason, and that for fifteen hundred years it has kept the peace between humans and all magical beings. That we were all better off with magic hidden from the larger world.”

Larouse scoffed. “Zat eez a fentasy. And I am a fairy who makés designair eehlushe-ons fair a livéng. I am an expairt een fentasy.”

“Then why was Merlin’s Curse created in the first place?”

“Ze why isn’t known. Mairlin and thosé who 'élpéd 'im waire all keehléd een ze casteng of et, and Mairlin’s lab was destroyed en ze procéz, destroyeng most of ze team’s notes, jurnals, and so-on. We know lit-tell of who was even wairkeng wiv Mairlin, nevairmind zéir goals air objectives. Zere are un 'undred theairees abut why ze curse was created, but nobody reahl-lee knows.”

“Merlin had a team to create the curse?”

“Oui. Zis eez much like René's effairt to break ze curse. Not even ze lejéndary Mairlin could do eet alon. Eet took a group of sairsairairs acteng togethair to cast ze spell, and to break eet. René 'as gottén much of ze attenshe-on as ze un who brok ze curse, but 'e was not acténg aloné, and as you know,” Larouse took a deep breath. “Breakng ze curse kihld 'im and évairyone who was breakng et wiv 'im.”

“Once again, my condolences.”

“Merci.”

“Did something go wrong with the casting of the spell?”

“Non. Eet did not.” She sighed. “I do not know ze ésotairic details of ze spellwairk. I undairstand zum, een ze basic concépts, but eet was extremé-lee complex and I design decairative illusions, bare-lee parlair tricks by comparison. Eet was beyond mon knowlédge and undairstandéng. Even René , as brillante as 'é was, bare-lee undairstood enough of eet to try and bréak eet.”

She chuckled wistfully. “I do not think even Mairlin 'imself propair-lee undairstood zé spellwairk 'e was fairgeng, eizair.”

“Oh? What makes you think Merlin didn’t know what he was forging?”

“Eet eez populair to view ancient spells as plus .. ah, maire, powairful and maire advanced, but zey réahl-lee waire not. Modairn spell knowledge eez significént-lee greatair, and ancient spellcraftairs waire playéng wiv brute force methods, and fumbleng around een blind luck and keepeng secrets abut 'ow zey madé thengs wairk, if zéy even tru-lee 'ad ze right theairy abut 'ow thengs waire wairkeng. Eet eez ...” she paused a moment. “Eet eez lik 'ow wiv ze pyramids, many péople think zey 'ad secret wais of buildeng zem, whén ze reahlitay was eet was just clevair engineaireng techniqués zat waire fairgotten and rediscovaired, and mostlee a whole lot of, a, 'ard labair.”

“I see,” the host said. “So, if we don’t know why Merlin created the curse, why did your husband break it?”

“Zat eez a vairy impairtent questshe-on. René’s why.” She was silent for a moment. “Zum of eet was raw ideahlism. He firm-lee believed een objective truth. Reahlitay eez réahl, regardlez of what we believe, and zé mairé what you think and believe diverges from what is actual-lee reahl, ze maire eet weehl … come bak to bite you.

“But, mostly, za whirld 'as gotten smallair. Een Mairlin’s time, ze whirld was 'ugé. Zéré was zo much space and deestancé between thengs and peoplé, zo few people een ze whirld. Eet was easy fair magical and non-magical people to livé séparate, apart from each othair.

“Pairsonal-lee, I think zat was ze intent behind Mairlin’s spell. Ze spécifics of why are anyone’s guez, as I said, but I think eet was meent to faircé us to live apart from éach othair, fair whatevair reason.” She sighed. “But ze whirld we live een todai eez much smallair than eet uséd to bé. Zéré are zo many maire people alive todai, magical as wéll as non-magical, and ze spaces availabuhl fair us to live apart from each othair just do not exeest anymaire. Mairlin’s curse 'urt regulair 'umans, too. Eet madé zem deaf to magic, unabuhl to manipulate eet air employ eet zemsélvés, and eet also attaked zeir minds. Beeng exposéd to magic, and ze undisguized trué fairms of magical creatuairs, eet would quik-lee drivé 'umans insane, even keehl zém! We all waire 'urt and keehléd by ze curse.

Ze curse 'ad to end, bécausé eet was 'urteng and keehleng péoplé, and stifleng our futuair.”

“Many people were hurt in the breaking of the curse, some even killed in accidents and the immediate chaos that followed. Two people died and fifteen people were hospitalized when a dragon was suddenly forced into his natural form while driving across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.”

“Oui. We deep-lee régret zat zat 'appened, but non mattair what wé did, zum amount of zat was unavoidabuhl.” She sighed. “We knew zat makéng zat change, especial-lee zo quik-lee, would cause its own pain, and fair zat we aré sairry. But gréat changés throughout 'eestairy, 'owevair necézary zey waire, 'owevair béttair lifé becamé aftair ze change, steehl 'urt along ze wai. Mon 'usband sacrificed 'is life to end a curse zat was causeng uncountabuhl 'arm. Zere eez not a dai zat goés by zat I do not wish zat we could 'avé found anothair wai, zat I do not wish mon René waire haire wiv me, but zeré was non othair wai. He knew zat, and 'e steehl gavé 'is life. I knew zat, and I let 'im.” She paused, her voice cracking on the last word, but powered through a moment later. “Hé wénted to end our suffaireng, evén ze 'umans who did not reahlize 'ow much zey suffairéd, zo zat wé could build a new life, a béttair lifé, togethair. Zat eez 'is why.”

“Rachel Martin’s interview with Mrs. Stéphane Larouse, wife of the late René Larouse, the man who broke Merlin’s Curse, will continue in a moment.”

*Getting close now.* Cara unmuted voice guidance, letting it drown out the commercials.

“Turn left onto East Round Robin Road.”

Houses with large yards drifted past as she kept her eyes out for the next turn. A mix of sizes and ages, they ranged from modest ranch houses a few decades old to large, modern-style houses that bordered on mansions. *Nice area. Not a proper suburb, but not completely rural.* *Though the suburb is encroaching,* she thought as she passed a cleared-out section of forest, with multiple cookie-cutter houses going up along a winding network of planned neighborhood-style streets.

“In a half-mile, turn left onto Quiet Run Road.”

She passed a billboard with a “We buy property!” ad, for a big-name property developer she recognized, a client of a competing firm. *Maggie mentioned them the other day, said Mr. Sandersen dropped them like a hot potato when he found out they were looking for us to fudge numbers for them.*

“Turn left onto Quiet Run Road.”

Her turn signal clicked loudly as she held the wheel over. The road wasn’t completely straight, and curved around rises and dips in the terrain. Small patches of trees broke up a few of the properties, and an intermittent sidewalk ran along both sides of the road. She passed a few kids playing in a yard, a half-dozen bicycles piled in the driveway.

“In a half-mile, your destination will be on the right.”

“That must be the place,” she said aloud, turning the radio down. The only house on that side of the road for the next mile, it sat far enough back from the road to make a large front yard, but not so far back that it would be too long of a walk from the street. A paved path ran from the front porch to meet the sidewalk. The house was huge, and followed a much older style that looked like a blend between colonial and Victorian in design, with a large front porch and a massive, double front door in the center. Despite being larger than even the mansion-sized houses in the extended neighborhood, it looked like it only had two floors, and maybe an attic. *I bet that thing’s a bitch to heat in the winter …*

Pulling past the yellow hydrant in front of the house, she briefly considered pulling into the empty driveway, but instead opted to pull off onto the wide shoulder the end of the path, and put her car in park. She flipped her visor down to give herself a quick once-over in the mirror. Her long, brown hair was neatly tucked into a professional bun. Makeup was good, no touch-ups needed. No lashes out of place. She met her own forest green eyes. “Running solo with one of the firm’s long-standing clients. This is a big step up. Maggie said you were her first choice for this job. Nevermind that Stan and Frank both bailed on it. It’s a great opportunity. You need this. You got this.” She closed her eyes and took a deep, composing breath, then met her own gaze again as she put on her courteous business face. “I’ve got this.”

Flipping the visor back up, she turned her car off, opened the door, and grabbed her light brown leather briefcase out of the passenger seat. It didn’t match her personal style, but the leather briefcase bags were a signature of Sandersen and Associates, and she had to admit that it went very well with her business suit, giving her a solid professional appearance.

Setting her briefcase on the driver’s seat, she briefly adjusted her business suit after the hour-long drive, then collected the bag, shut the door, and locked the car as she put on a confident stroll up the path to the house. Walking up the stairs, the low heels of her shoes clunked hollowly on the solid wood floor of the porch. Spotting a button next to the enormous double front door, she pressed it, causing a deep, two-toned bell to chime inside.

“Come on in,” a man called from somewhere inside. “The front door is unlocked.”

Reaching over, she grabbed a handle and worked the latch, pushing open one of the double doors. It was big and heavy, but swung easily on well-oiled hinges. Stepping inside, she found herself in a large hallway with a high-vaulted ceiling that ran through the center of the house, the front end doubling as a foyer. *Just this entryway is larger than my entire apartment … oh, wow, that smells good …* she thought as she was immediately hit by the smell of baking cookies. “Mister Arnold?”

“I’m in the kitchen!” the man called, his deep voice clear despite being muffled by distance and doors. “Miss Peterson, I presume?”

“Yes, sir,” she called, looking down the long hallway with uncertainty. “I know I’m a little early. Traffic coming out of town wasn’t as bad as I expected.”

“That’s perfectly fine! Go ahead and make yourself at home in the sitting room, on your left coming in the front door. I set many of my records in there, already. It’s not all of them, but I figured it would be easiest to start with the oldest first.”

“That can be a good place to start,” she said, turning and opening the first door on the left. “Especially if you have good … records …” She trailed off as she stepped into what looked to be a large sitting room that could double as a ballroom, filled with mountains of boxes, crates, and stacks of paper, many taller than she was. The front of the room was the worst, though the back of the room still had a large, clear pathway to another door leading back into the central hallway. *I think I’m getting an idea of why Stan and Frank both said fuck this to this job … ho, boy …* She wrinkled her nose at the dusty odor of *very old* paper, holding back the urge to sneeze.

“I’m afraid to say that I have not been the best at keeping things *organized*, but I am very good at *keeping* everything,” Mr. Arnold called from the back of the house, followed by the faint rattle of cookware. “Can I get you anything to drink? Coffee, tea, water? The coffee will be a moment, it’s not done brewing. I just picked up some orange juice, if you would prefer that.”

“Coffee is fine,” she said, stepping around a pile of boxes and document folders that towered half-way to the vaulted ceiling. Near the center of the room was a positively antique couch that was left mostly clear, along with a cocktail table in front of it. Setting her briefcase on the couch, she pulled out her laptop and set it on the cocktail table, opened it up, and powered it on. She paused, glanced at the mountains of paperwork around her, and turned back to her briefcase to pull out the laptop’s charger. “Do you mind if I plug my laptop in?”

“By all means, go right ahead,” he called, followed by the muffled thunk of a cabinet slamming shut. “I know this is not going to be an easy task, so whatever makes it easier for you. Please, let me know if there’s anything else you need.”

 “Is there a- never mind, I found a plug,” she said, glancing around at the mess of a sitting room. Working her way past a veritable fort of crates and boxes, and the mix of modern and antique furniture it was piled on and around, she let the power cord trail behind her as she made her way to the wall. She had to reach under a writing desk that looked like it was hand-crafted in the eighteen hundreds, but the plug was close enough that her cord would still reach her laptop on the cocktail table without being an enormous tripping hazard.

Returning to her laptop, she sat down on the couch, carefully adjusted the cocktail table to put her laptop within relatively comfortable reach, and started opening spreadsheet templates, along with their records for his accounts with the firm.

A gust of air wafted through the room, bringing with it the smell of coffee and cookies, and something she didn’t recognize, though it wasn’t unpleasant, along with the faint clinking of dishware. The floor creaked, and a large tray and stand was set down on the far side of the cocktail table. “How do you take your coffee?” Mr. Arnold rumbled.

Cara looked up, and froze, the blood draining from her face as she locked eyes with a living, breathing dragon looming over her. Covered in burnished bronze scales, with two ebony horns sprouting from the back of its head, and large enough that it could probably swallow her in two bites, if not whole. *Oh. THAT’S why Stan and Frank said fuck this job.*

“I have fresh cream, and sugar,” the dragon rumbled with Mr. Arnold’s voice, gesturing at the tray it hunched over with one foreclaw, while it picked up a steaming pot of coffee with another. “And hot chocolate mix, if you would like to add that.” His copper eyes, with their vertical slits, remained locked with hers.

“B- black is fine,” she stuttered. “Mister Arnold, I presume?” she managed to squeak out after a nervous swallow.

The dragon nodded, and poured the steaming hot coffee into a cup. “Yes. Though,” he set the pot down, and reached up to lightly scratch behind the mobile frills set below his horns, “Mark Arnold, or Arnold Marcus, or any of the other combinations I’ve used, they’re just fake names to get by in human society. My real name is Elekin.” He gently picked up the cup and saucer, and slowly handed it over to her. “They didn’t tell you I’m a dragon, did they?”

“No,” she said, carefully taking the cup and saucer from his enormous claw, half on autopilot. “They, uh, left that detail out.” *Maggie, you sonofabitch. I’m going to kill you. If this thing doesn’t eat me, first.* She set the saucer in her lap and closed her eyes, taking a deep breath. *No, stop. He’s a person, not an animal. A long-standing client. He didn’t eat Stan or Frank. This is a big break. You need this.* She opened her eyes, both hands clutching the saucer to keep them from shaking. She looked up and tried to give him her best, cheerfully-professional smile, and at least half succeeded. “Not that it matters.” With another breath, she steeled her nerves, and managed to bring the coffee up to her lips without shaking. It smelled amazing, but even without tasting it, she could tell it was still too hot to drink, so she blew on it instead.

The dragon, *Elekin,* snorted and his lips turned up in a smile as he picked up a teapot and poured water into another, much larger cup. “Well, I have to say you’re doing better than the last two they sent. The first one walked in, took one look at me, said ‘Nope!’ and turned around and walked right back out. The second spent five minutes stumbling over his words, then screamed and bolted from my house when I yawned.” Setting the teapot down, he started swirling an infuser around in the cup.

“I haven’t been here five minutes, yet,” Cara pointed out, carefully taking a sip of her coffee. It was still very hot, but nevertheless, she could tell it was a good roast.

“True,” the dragon said, setting the chain of the diffusor down over the lip of the teacup. He added cream, and sugar, then used the diffusor to stir it all together. “But you’re not stumbling over your words, and we are having a conversation.”

She took another sip of her coffee, pointedly staring into the cup. “Politeness in this case might just be a survival instinct.” *It’s never a good idea to be rude to someone who can bite you in half.*

He chuckled, a deep rumble she could almost feel in her chest, and set the diffusor down again. “Perhaps.” He picked up a platter of enormous cookies, so fresh they were still lightly steaming. “Chocolate chip cookie? They weren’t quite done cooling when you arrived, but I figured they were close enough.”

“Yes, thank you,” she said, accepting another plate from him after he deftly removed a cookie from the platter with a set of tongs. The cookie was enormous, larger than her whole hand stretched out, so she broke off a piece to eat in chunks. “I feel like I’m visiting a little old grandma rather than a firebreathing dragon,” she said, taking a bite. “Mm, this is delicious,” she mumbled, closing her eyes at the explosion of gooey, chocolatey goodness.

“I might have eaten a grandmother or two to get the recipe,” he said.

She froze, shifting her eyes to look at him. He gave her a wink. She resumed chewing, and picked up her coffee, taking a sip to help wash the cookie down. “I’m not going to lie, I might be willing to assault a grandmother or two to get that recipe, myself,” she said.  *Oh my god, I’m bantering with a dragon. Have I gone insane?* “That is very good, thank you.”

He smiled, lips firmly together, and picked up a cookie from the platter. “Thank you,” he said, dipping his snout before lying down on the floor, his head now only a little higher than hers would be if she were standing. He popped the cookie into his mouth, giving her a brief glimpse of large fangs and sharp teeth.

Eyes closed, he briefly chewed, then swallowed. Cara suppressed a shudder as she was reminded again of how easily he could turn her into a snack, then took a deep breath. *Business. I’m here for business. A full audit and review of all claimed assets, and an assessment in preparation for an expected tax audit. I need this. And,* she glanced around at the room, piled high with boxes upon boxes of papers. *Holy shit, does it look like he needs an accountant.* “So,” she said. “Let’s get started.”

He nodded, “Yes. Like I said, this isn’t everything, but it is the earliest of what I have, mostly.” He scratched behind a horn in a sheepish-looking gesture. “I honestly haven’t been the best at keeping it organized.” He dropped his foreclaw, meeting her gaze with a surprisingly earnest look. “But, I did find an assessment of my assets and net worth done by Brandon and Sons, shortly after I came here from England.” He turned away, glancing about the piles.

“Brandon and Sons … I’m not familiar with them.”

“Oh, they changed hands and names a couple of times, before going out of business after the Rupert’s grandson sold half the business off,” he said, still looking around the room. With a slight frown, he stood up, towering over her once again. “I set it aside, so it would be easy to find …” He looked in her direction. “Ah, there it is. Pardon me.” He leaned towards her, reaching across the cocktail table, to pick up a leather-bound folder of documents sitting near her on the couch.

*He’s just a high-powered client,* Cara told herself as she pushed mental images of how easy he could claw her apart or crush her. *You’ve handled high-powered clients before. And he’s going out of his way to be nice and gentle. He made you cookies!*

Elekin gently set the folder down on the cocktain table and carefully opened it, revealing a neatly-arranged bundle of positively ancient papers. Cara reached out, then paused, her hand halfway to the folder, a sudden thought occurring to her. “Um, should I be wearing gloves to handle these?”

The dragon chuckled, and shook his head. “No, it will be fine. They have preservation spells on them. I had to completely redo the spellwork after the curse broke, of course,” he rolled his eyes, “But it’s fairly simple magic.”

Cara took a breath. *Right. Magic.* “Okay.” She reached the rest of the way and gently picked up the bundle of papers. On the very top was a cover letter, on special-printed stationary of one Rupert J. Brandon And Sons, Esquire, Accounting And Attorneys At Law. The title of the document read, ‘A Full and Detailed Accounting Of The Finances And Assets And Properties Of One Marcus Arnold.’ She looked at the date of the report, then blinked, and read it two more times. “Seventeen Fifty-Eight?”

“Yes,” he nodded, settling back down on the floor. “That was three years after I came to America, seeking the promise of the New World.” He shuffled his wings in a shrug-like motion. “Even then, the world was rapidly shrinking, and I hoped to find new territory of my own.”

“Did you find it?” she asked, slowly shuffling through the papers, skimming their tight, neatly-written script.

“I didn’t find what I thought I was looking for,” he said, “Not exactly. My concept of what is my territory is a bit more modern, and less rigid, than previous generations.” He flicked his frills. “It had to be. But I did find a new land to call home.”

“Good. I’m glad,” she said, and found that she honestly meant it. Skimming through more pages, she finally came to the final accounting and summary. Taking a breath, she turned to her laptop, and after a moment’s consideration, pulled up one of her spreadsheet templates. Plugging the information in to different tabs for cash, credit, assets, and property, she added a note of where it came from and the need to convert to modern value. *Oh, god … That’s going to be a nightmare.*

Taking a deep breath, she neatly restacked the papers in their bundle and returned them to their folder. “Okay, so that’s a good start.” She glanced around at the enormous stacks of documents. *Two hundred and sixty-six years of financial records … And this isn’t even all of it? Holy fuck …* “So, what do you have next?”

Elekin sat up and reached out a claw, picking up an old, beat-up looking crate, and setting it on the cocktail table. “I’m pretty sure this is the earliest set of documents after that assessment, though there might be some newer documents mixed in, and some older documents scattered in boxes of newer stuff.” He hunched over, his wings tucked close, and looked away from her as he shuffled his front claws. “I’ve been through several moves over the years, and not all of them were well-executed, so things might have gotten a little mixed up a time or two.”

Cara gave him a look, then reached into the box and pulled out two documents. One was a receipt for wages for a soldier of the Continental Army, dated seventeen seventy-seven. The implications of *that* caused her to raise an eyebrow. The other was a bill of sale for a live cow, dated nineteen forty-nine. “You bought a cow? Why would you buy a-“ she stopped mid-sentence and looked up to stare into empty space as the obvious dawned on her. “Nevermind. Figured it out. Stupid question.” Elekin gave her a toothy grin, which she found both endearing and unnerving at the same time.

She looked back down at the papers in her hand, and specifically the dates, and sighed. “These two documents are over a hundred and seventy years apart.” She set them down, separate from each other, then turned back to her laptop. She saved the spreadsheet, and closed the laptop. “First things first, is organizing.”

He nodded. “Makes sense.”

She stood up, and looked around at the mountains of paperwork around her. “Alright, so, first, we’re going to organize everything by century. Then by decade, and then year, and then go from there.”

“Excellent,” he nodded. “What do you need from me?”

“Pick a stack over there and start sorting through it. If it’s from the seventeen hundreds, put it there, the eighteen hundreds, put it there, the nineteen hundreds, there, and the two thousands, there.” She paused. “And if it doesn’t have a clear date, put it there.” She picked up her cup and took a swig. “And keep this coffee flowing.”

“Yes, ma’am,” he rumbled.

She froze, and slowly turned towards him. *I just ordered a dragon around …*

He smiled at her, mouth closed, and gave her another wink before standing up and carefully turning to assess the stacks of boxes next to him. Selecting one, he laid back down and started pulling out documents to examine.

The mental image of him rifling through papers while looking down his snout through a pair of reading glasses popped into her head, and she had to suppress a giggle. That would have been very unprofessional. With another deep breath, and another gulp of coffee, she turned to select her own box, and got to work.

 

\*\*\*

 

“Hey, we both went to Lehigh!” Cara paused, her smile turning to a frown. “Just … A hundred thirty-odd years apart.”

She felt the dragon loom over her, stretching out his neck and tilting his head to look over her shoulder. “Ah, yes, my chemistry degree.” He snorted a soft chuckle, the edge of his warm breath brushing her hair.  “They added four elements to the periodic table that year. Professor Abbott was convinced he’d add a fifth.” He sat back, and when Cara turned to look at him, he was gazing down at the table, seeing past it, his frills sagging. “I think he might have, if his heart hadn’t given out.” His frills twitched and the corners of his mouth curved up in a wistful smile as he met her eyes. “He always did like his desserts and sweets, and insisted that a life without them wasn’t worth living.”

“So, you have a chemistry degree?” she asked, hopefully shifting to a happier subject.

He nodded, then flicked his frills back with a snort. “Not that it would mean much today. Much of what I studied as the bleeding edge of science in university back then is taught in high school today.” He shrugged his wings, then carefully lifted them over the stacks of documents to stretch, though even in the large room he still couldn’t fully extend them. Standing, he furled his wings, then moved his personal stacks of sorted documents to the main stacks organized by century, “no clear date,” and the fastest-growing stack of “not actually financial records.” He looked at something behind her. “Did you have any plans for lunch?”

Cara looked at her watch, and reminded of how long it had been since breakfast, her stomach growled, eliciting a chuckle from Elekin. “Nothing in particular. I saw a couple local joints on my drive in, and figured I’d stop at one of them.”

The dragon nodded, then flicked his frills. “If you’d like, I’d be happy to make you something here. The local restaurants are passable, but not anything to write home about, in my opinion.” He frowned. “They’re always out of virgin princesses.”

She blinked, opening her mouth, then closing it, not sure how to process that statement, until she looked at him and was met with his deadpan stare. “Oh, ha, ha,” she sighed, rolling her eyes. “You almost had me there for a moment.”

He raised an eyeridge at her. “Almost?”

“Shush,” she said, crumpling a piece of scrap paper from her notebook and tossing it at him. The crumpled ball of paper was half-way across the room before she realized what she had done, and she froze in horror, the blood draining from her face once again. *I just threw a crumpled sheet of paper at a dragon.* *… Worse, I just threw a crumpled piece of paper at a* client!

The wad of paper bounced of Elekin’s snout. He blinked as silence fell over the room, then he coughed, shook his head, then staggered back, away from the stacks of boxes, wobbling dangerously. “Ack! Oh no! What horror!” He tumbled over backwards, flailing around with much drama, though he managed to completely avoid the piles of records. “You’ve found my one weakness!” He took a single, ragged breath, eyes wide, head shaking as if it took great effort to hold it up, then released it in an exaggerated whisper. “Crumpled paper!” He froze, then his head thunked lifelessly to the ground. “Blegh,” he said after a moment of silence, opening his mouth and lolling his tongue out, before laying still once again.

Cara watched, mouth agape, then gave him an exasperated look. “Are you always this big of a goof?”

He cracked an eye, looking at her under a mostly-hooded eyelid. “Sometimes. Sometimes I’m goofier.” He stuck his tongue back out to play dead again.

She tore out another piece of paper from her notebook, crumpled it up, and tossed it across the room, bouncing it off the side of his head. He opened the eye facing her, glancing in the direction of the paper wad, then back at her. “You’re billing me for those, aren’t you?”

“Yep.”

“Alright, I yield, I yield,” he said, rolling to his feet and standing up. With a small shake of his head, he resettled his wings on his back. “So, lunch?”

She chuckled, standing up and stretching. “Sure, what do you have?”

“How do you feel about virgin princesses?” She reached back down and picked up her notebook. “Or roast beef. I have roast beef.”

“Roast beef sounds fine,” she said, setting the notebook back down.

“Excellent. To the kitchen!” He turned, stepping towards the far door.

“Um, actually, can I use your bathroom first?”

“Of course!” He turned his head, twisting his neck around to look at her over his shoulder, then gestured with his snout. “It’s the second door on the right in the main hall. I’ll be in the kitchen at the end of the hall on the left when you’re done.”

After freshening up, Cara followed the central hall to a T-junction, and the open kitchen door. Like the rest of the house, it was sized to accommodate him as a dragon, though the counters were low enough to be functional for a human. Cara felt like she was walking into an industrial-sized kitchen.

As she walked through the large doors, Elekin was just pulling a whole beef roast out of a warmer. He set it on the large island counter, next to bowls of vegetables and a plastic tub of potato salad. “The potato salad is store-bought, but the supermarket up the road makes it locally, and it’s really good.”

“So, you can eat more than just meat?” She asked. “Or virgin princesses?”

“Oh, those are just a delicacy,” he said, giving her a wink. “Technically speaking, I am an obligate carnivore, I need at least some meat in my diet for proper nutrition, but I can eat and enjoy a highly varied diet.”

“I see,” she said as he carefully wielded a large knife and serving fork, appearing comically small in his claws, to carve off slices of roast beef. She picked up the plate he had set out, and he kept carving slices off until she held up her free hand, pulling the plate away.

After verifying she wouldn’t want any more, he set the knife and fork down, and Cara was once again reminded of the fact that she was sitting next to a dragon who could easily make a meal of her when he picked up the entire remainder of the roast with one foreclaw, popped it into his mouth, and started chewing. She shivered.

Elekin frowned, and swallowed, making her shudder again. “Is something wrong?”

“Sorry, it’s me. I’m just … I just keep thinking about how you could eat me in, like, two bites, and that’s a little unnerving.

“Actually,” he said, bringing his right claw up to scratch behind his frill, “It would be a tight squeeze, but I’m pretty sure I could swallow you whole …” He grimaced, tugging at a horn with the same claw. “Yep, I realized how bad that sounded as soon as I said it.” He released his horn and laid down, lowering his head to just below hers. “Sorry. I’m not used to being a dragon around humans.”

She frowned, tilting her head. “Aren’t you always a dragon?”

“Well, yes, but I’m not used to looking like a dragon around humans.” He shrugged his wings. “Merlin’s curse was cast fifteen hundred years ago. I’ve never been able to be myself around humans without all of the problems that it caused.” He sighed, his frills twitching. “And all of the other magical beings are mostly human-sized, or fairly close to it, so most of the “magical community” spaces are built to fit them, not dragons, so even around other magical creatures, I rarely looked like a dragon.”

“So, you guys are outcasts even among the outcasts?”

He snorted. “Sort of, I guess, in a way, though we never really looked at it like that.” He shuffled his wings. “Either way, I’m not used to thinking about what would make others uncomfortable.” He dipped his head. “I apologize for that. I’ll be more mindful of it in the future.”

“Thank you,” she said, then paused, her fork halfway to her mouth. *That sounds like something I would say to Max, every time I did something he didn’t like …* She shuddered, and put her fork down. “No, no, don’t do that. *I’m* sorry.” She brought her hands up to run them through her hair, but stopped herself before she ruined her hairdo. “You hired me, you’ve done nothing to threaten me, you’ve been nothing but helpful and a gracious host, and I’m the one telling you to change who you are in your own home.”

Cara closed her eyes and put her hands to her face, covering her mouth and eyes, collecting her thoughts and trying to recenter herself. *Breath, Cara. Slow breaths. I don’t have to always apologize for myself, but apologizing for my mistake doesn’t mean that I’m a screw-up.*

She felt him lean forward, the light shifting behind her eyelids, the sound of his breath coming closer, below her head level. “Is everything okay? If I said something wrong, I apologize, just let me-“

“No, no, it’s not you,” she said, pulling her hands away from her face and sitting up with a sigh. “I realized I was doing to you what someone else used to do to me, and that was wrong. *I* apologize. You’re a dragon, and you could bite me in two without trying, but that doesn’t mean I should be afraid that you will. George, at the office, is six-foot-seven, and three hundred fifty pounds of pure muscle. If he’s not at the office, he’s at the gym lifting weights heavier than I am, twice over. He could snap my neck just by squeezing, if he wanted to, but I’m not afraid that he will.” She chuckled. “He’s actually the biggest teddy bear I know.”

Elekin gently reached out and placed a foreclaw on her hand, more putting a single talon over her hand. “That’s probably the most understanding thing someone has said to me in the last six months.” He pulled his claw away. “But I do also need to be considerate of others, because I *am* a dragon. I certainly wouldn’t blame anyone for being angry if I brought a live cow into a shopping mall and tore into it as a snack.” He shuffled his frills. “But I also appreciate your consideration. I’ll try not to be an ass, but as you insist, I won’t overly censor myself inside my own home.”

“Good,” she said, picking up her fork again.

It was the 80s...

I had a neighbor who hated my cats.  she would frequently complain that they were relieving themselves behind her bushes and would even collect it and leave it at our doorstep.  when that didn't get a response my mother told me she brought a coffee can (not even filled) with cat poo.  They were neighborhood outside cats, and its typical cat behavior.  

This gal was a hater of all animals.  we would frequently see her running off birds and squirrels just for being in her yard.

Over a period of a few months three of my cats had sudden organ failure, and the vet suspected poisoning.  It was a mystery to us, until we heard from another neighbor that she was bragging about poisoning our cats with antifreeze.  

When I got confirmation that it was indeed she who poisoned my cats, I took matters into my own hands.  I went to the local feed store and bought a 10lb bag of bird seed.  as well as a 5lb bag of walnuts.  that night shortly after midnight when the lights had been off in her house, I spread the contents all over her lawn and the bushes.  

The next day was pandemonium.  And I'm pretty sure she was a nervous wreck.  I never made the same mistake of admitting to the neighbors what I had done, but honestly I don't think anyone else cared.  

Not long after I had joined the US Navy, and whenever I came home on leave, I would check to make sure she still lived there and I would do it again.  ",22,1743371205.0,pettyrevenge,18,0.7,False

 I've tried lowering the grind size down all the way to 5 which give a bit longer of a shot 15 seconds shot time, but at 5 it's very powdery so can't go any lower I don't think.

 I've added a 54mm filter paper to the bottom to catch fine particles which works for texture, but the flow rate then increases again. 

Already used over a full 500g bag but don't seem to be getting close to what I know these beans should taste like! 

Any suggestions would be appreciated! Thanks",2,1743371094.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I'm disabled, and cannot work a proper job, and was denied SSI due to my age. 

I'm stuck babysitting for 12 hours a day 4x a week, my sister does not want me on her furniture because i nonstop smell of sulfur (No idea why.) and she refuses to pay me in cash. she also requires that i feed, walk, water and bathe her dogs (St Bernard and pug) along with feeding and watering her cat, She sometimes gives me snacks or treats like energy drinks, but very very rarely pays me for babysitting. she pays my mom, but not me.    
My mom drives her to and from work, meaning I'm there alone with the animals, and her son for 2-3 hours in the morning and 2-3 hours in the eve.   
I've asked her in the past if she'd pay me, and she claims she will- but never does. She comes up with excuses like ""10$ a week is too much."" and i've even suggested 5$ a week. 

lately my sister's been accusing me of stealing her food, or things like coffee creamer, but i do not. usually if i have cash from commissions i'll buy food for my mom, newphew and I, and she'll throw away the remaining drink if i store it in her fridge for longer than one day (Sometimes it's a 2liter of pop or a gallon of a drink.) Yet she accuses me of stealing her stuff, requires i sit on the floor, ect.

I don't babysit by choice, my mom drags me along so I ""do my fair share"" and not get kicked out.

1jnnemu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jnnemu/help/,Help?,"I need advice or just somewhere to vent.

I (32f) am currently 27 weeks pregnant with our second child. Our first is 2 for context. My husband (31m) is very lazy and doesn’t help with any of the house hold tasks. 

A typical week for me looks like this,
4:30-5am I wake up to get ready for work. At 5:30am I feed the cats and dog and let the dog out. I wake my husband up and start on our son’s breakfast. While it’s cooking I grab a diaper and clothes for my son so my husband can get him up and I’ll pack his daycare bag and my lunch. By 6am I sit with our son while he eats and just hang out and play until we leave at 6:30am. Then we load up the car and drive 25min to daycare, then I drive another 40min to work. I work 8am - 5:30pm. My husband does pick him up from daycare and feeds him dinner. I get home around 6:30 and we play until 7pm then it’s bath and milk. My husband will “read” to him for 15 min then I put him to bed, which is difficult now because my belly is big so it’s hard to put him in the crib. Then by then it about 8pm I make something quick for myself for dinner, watch tv and scroll until 9pm then it’s time for me to go to bed. I do bit of cleaning in between making meals and getting everyone ready to leave or go to bed.

My husbands day is more of wake up when I wake him up, scroll on his phone for 10min and then get our son up and dressed. Proceeds to the bathroom for another 10min then makes a coffee and scrolls on his phone until me and my son have to leave. He has been laid off since Jan because he works out side and is home all day playing video games and smoking weed. When I get home nothing has been cleaned. Even the one task I need him to do which is the cat litter. I’ve started taking on the task even tho bc I’m pregnant I shouldn’t be, bc my cats were going 1-2 weeks without it being clean and they would pee in the laundry instead. On the sundays I wake everyone up at 7am so we can head to the pool for 8 for him to take our son swimming for 30-45min. 

On the weekends I clean as much as I can but I am so tired and have really bad pelvic and back pain from being pregnant. I also have high blood pressure, only when pregnant apparently, so I do have to sit and rest every 10-20min. I do nap when my son naps. I love bringing him into my bed for his nap which is typically 12:15-2pm so that’s when I rest and my husband will either play Xbox or sleep as well. 

I guess my point is I feel like I am wearing myself out and all I do is ask for help but it ends in him getting mad and stop talking to me. I can’t stand the constant scrolling on the phone while I have to get up 100x a day to tend to our son and animals and household chores while he just honestly doesn’t do anything. I don’t want to leave bc he’s not abusive, he’s just lazy. We’ve been together since we were 16, so 16 years and it’s not like I can afford to live just me and the kids. This is Canada after all and everything is very expensive and I do love him a lot. I just want help. 

Anyways thanks for letting me vent. :)

1jnnao4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1jnnao4/do_you_know_the_title_of_this_novel/,Do you know the title of this novel?,"“Good Morning ladies!” The dorm senior, Jenna, shouts as she makes her way down the corridor of the dorms, banging on each door as she goes. I roll over with a gro-an and stretch to pick up my phone. I read the time and then rub my eyes before checking the time again because there’s no way I read it right. Glancing around the room I feel confident that my eyes are now working correctly and check the time again.
“Mother fluffer!” I curse under my breath. I was right the first time. It’s 5:30 AM! That confirms my suspicions that perfect Jenna with the too-friendly smile is evil. It’s the first day of university and classes start at 9 AM. Why on earth is she waking the whole dorm up at 5:30? I can hear grumbling and cursing from the other girls through the paper-thin walls as Jenna loudly announces that it’s shower time. I grab the pillow and press it over my head to try and block out the noise. I had my alarm set for 8 AM, which would have given me plenty of time to shower and have breakfast before our first class. I manage to block out enough of the noise that I start drifting back to sleep. BANG, BANG, BANG!
“Josie Banks, room number 5, I don’t hear any movement in there!” Jenna’s sickly sweet voice calls through the door as she hammers on it, then she begins to rattle the door handle. With a huff I chuck my pillow on the floor, throw back my covers and get up, stomping to the door I yank it open.
“It is 5:30 AM!” I hiss at Jenna. She smiles with fake sympathy as she looks me up and down.
“I am aware of the time Miss Banks, but this year’s stock is going to need extra time to get ready if we are going to make any of you look presentable,” she grins.
“We are not cattle,” I huff and begin to shut the door in her face. She stops it with a foot in the doorway and looks down at her clipboard.
“Josie Banks, eighteen years old, here to study criminology. Father is deceased, mother suffers from psychosis and currently resides in a secure hospital. Josie needs support to process her emotions and would benefit greatly from structure and routine. Josie has no other living rel…” I cut her off by robing the clipboard from her hand and reading the information sheet she had on me. With every word I read of my personal information, my anger grows, like each letter adds fuel to the already growing fire within me. Who gave her this information? She’s just a senior student with a voluntary role as dorm leader, she has no right or need for this information. This is a breach of privacy.
“How did you get this?” I seeth. Students gather in the corridor, their attention now focused on the drama unfolding in front of them.
“As the dorm leader, I am privy to any information that may help me to support you,” Jenna states, holding her head high like she feels superior. “It was in the enrolment statement, that you signed and agreed to when you accepted your place within this university,” she adds. I tear the page from the clip holding it down and slam the board into her heart.
“You had no right to that information, and you certainly had no right to broadcast it to the whole dorm,” I shout as I shove her away from my door. There’s a brief look of shock on her face as her head cracks against the wall before her expression goes blank and she slumps down to the floor with a thud. There's a distinct crack in the plaster on the wall where she hit it. Gasps sound out down the hall as I slam the door. I lean against it in disbelief, looking down at my hands in disgust.
“Someone call an ambulance!” I hear one of the girls in the hall shout.
How did that just happen? I didn't shove her that hard did I?… no, it's not possible, I'm not that strong and I barely touched her. She must have tripped on something and hit her head. That crack in the wall must have already been there and I'd just not noticed it until now.
“Is she breathing?” I hear a panicked voice ask. I don't hear the answer as my ears begin to ring and my heart begins to pound loudly. I feel as if the oxygen has been svcked out of the room as I draw in gasping lungfuls of useless air. My heart tightens with every breath like more and more weight is being added on top of me. My vision goes blurry before turning completely black, then I become light, and the weight lifts from me as I relax into peaceful darkness.
“Miss Banks wake up!” a stern voice penetrates the blissful bubble of silence I had fallen into. I blink open my eyes, letting my blurry vision adjust to take in the figure hovering above me. It's a plump lady with a grim-faced expression that I don't recognise.
“Who are you?” I murmur, pushing myself up into a sitting position and looking around to take in my surroundings.
“ I'm Officer Shelby, I'm with the Mount University Police. We need to take you down to the station,” she gives me a sympathetic smile as she pulls me up to my feet. In the broken doorway of my room stands another police officer. This one is looking curiously between me, the doorway and the crack in the wall where Jenna had been slumped. I svck in a breath as I remember what had happened. Jenna is no longer there, which is good. I must have passed out for a short time and she had reported me to the police for causing her to fall.
“I'm sorry officer, this was all a bit of a misunderstanding. I didn't mean for her to fall, I just pushed her out of my doorway so I could close my door and…” I begin to explain until the officer holds up a hand to stop me.
“Save it for the interview honey,” she says softly, whilst guiding me out of the building and into the back of a waiting police car. My fellow students watch on, giving looks of pity, smirks and utter disgust as I pass… perfect, I've made a great first impression.

Chapter 2
For the next few hours, I watch the clock in the small room they have me locked in. I’d drank my small paper cup of water hours ago and I've counted every tiny crack I can find in the plastered walls at least ten times. Just when I'm at the point of driving myself completely insane by mentally replaying what happened with Jenna over and over again, the door opens. The male officer that I'd seen in my dorm room earlier walks in and takes the seat opposite me at the table.
“Sorry to keep you waiting Miss Banks,” he says, laying a paper folder out on the table. He opens it and begins to read through it in silence. The seconds tick by and I start to get fidgety in my seat at the uncomfortable silence. Just as I open my mouth to break the silence the door opens again and a tall man wearing an expensive-looking suit walks in holding a briefcase. The man looks down at me in an assessing way. He is extremely good-looking and exudes dominance in a way that makes him hard to look at.
“Is this her?” he says in an almost snort, jer-king his chin in my direction.
“Yes, Sir,” the police officer nods, motioning for the newcomer to sit next to him. He takes his seat and reads through the paperwork the officer hands to him. I study his face as he reads. He's one of those ageless guys. His serious, no-bulllshit demeanour makes him seem like he's much older, but his face is young. My guess is he could be anywhere between twenty and forty. He must feel me looking at him as his eyes flick up to mine over the paper and he holds my gaze. Everything in me screams at me to look away, to break the eye contact, but I don't. I won't be bullied by some stuck-up detective. His eyes grow intense and then I swear I see the flash of a smirk before he slams his hand down on the table, making me jump back in fright.
“Are you trying to challenge me Miss Banks?” he asks in a deeper voice than he'd used with the other officer.
“Challenge you?” I snort and raise an eyebrow, trying to use my attitude to mask how much he had scared me.
“I suggest you learn to submit, and quickly, because at the place you are going, the people won't be as tolerant as I am,” he says, closing the folder and putting it into his briefcase before turning to the officer and nodding. My heart pounds in my heart and panic grips me as I watch the two men shake hands. “I’ll take her from here,” the stuck-up detective tells the officer.
“No,” I manage to rasp out. “Please, I didn't mean to hurt her. I can't go to prison. I can't!… Don't I get a solicitor?… A phone call?” I plead with the officer as he leaves the room. I turn my attention back to the suited man. “Please sir, it was an accident,” I sob.
“Not so tough now are we?” he smirks at me. “Let's go, Miss Banks, I have a very busy schedule and don't have time for your tears,” he sighs and heads towards the door. I remain seated, frozen in fear and shock. “You have two seconds to follow me, otherwise I will leave you here and let the police throw you in prison,” he snaps.
“Wait, what?” I gasp and turn to look at him. He gestures to the open doorway he is standing in and without too much thought I scramble to my feet and rush to his side.
“That's what I thought,” I hear him remark under his breath. He walks down the corridor with large strides that I struggle to keep up with.
“Where are we going?” I whisper to him as we pass police officers who don't seem to pay any attention to us. He ignores me like the rude assh-ole that he is and doesn't even look at me until we reach the elevator. He presses the button and turns to face me whilst we wait for the doors to open.
“Tell me, Miss Banks, are you prone to panic attacks?” He asks
“Huh?” I respond, a little taken aback at this whole situation.
“Your file says you passed out from a suspected panic attack at the scene, and you seem to be on the brink of another panic attack now. So what I am asking, little girl, is if I’m going to have to hold your hand through our journey?” He snarks. Anger flares in me at his words.
“Well I’m sorry Mr Perfect, I’ve had  a day so do excuse me if I’m a little upset!” I hiss at him, crossing my arms to let him know how much of a badass I am. He gives me another of his barely there smirks and a nod in what seems like approval. The elevator dings at that moment,  the doors opening and he steps forward without another word. I follow the smarmy guy in and stand beside him. I watch as the doors  close, with a strange sense that they're closing on my old life.
“Collins,” he says, snapping me out of my strange thoughts I turn to give him a questioning look. “It's Mr Collins,” he says in a barely there whisper as he steps dangerously close and looks down at me. So close that when I take a breath my heart touches his. The air suddenly feels charged as I stare up into Mr Collins’ eyes. The arm holding the briefcase snakes around my back and he pulls me flush against his heart, causing me to gasp. Holy sh-it balls this man is hot. He brings up his other hand and gently strokes my cheek with a secret smile, then in a flash he grips my chin hard. “Sleep,” he demands, his eyes flashing blue as he speaks. My last thought before my body shuts down is that I'm going to knee this jer-k in the balls as soon as I get the opportunity.

Chapter 3
“Wake up, Miss Banks,” a smooth voice says, the tone washes over me like a loving caress, and for the first time in a very long time I feel safe and it's not something I want to wake up from just yet. I nuzzle my face into the warmth against my cheek. A sweet, buttery and woodsy kind of scent hits my nose and I give an approving hum at the pleasing smell. A grunt of disapproval ruins my contentment right before I am dropped unceremoniously onto my back. The landing is soft but still unpleasant.
“What the he-ll!” I curse, rushing to sit and take in my surroundings. I'm on a couch in a dimly lit room, bright light suddenly floods the room making me squint against it. I shift my attention to the source of the light, fighting the urge to hiss at it like a feral vampire. A large figure is framed by the beaming sunlight that is flooding the room through a window that spans the entire wall. The figure is fussing with the curtains that he's just opened and I quickly recognise him as the stuck-up detective, Mr Collins. The events of the day come rushing back to me like a tidal wave of anger, fear and complete confusion.
“What did you do to me? How did we get here?” I demand, gesturing to the room and jumping to my feet.
“I don't have time to baby you through this, so here is the quick version,” he starts as he unbuttons his suit jacket and hangs it over the back of a large leather office chair. “My name is Deacon Collins, I am the headmaster of Grey’s Academy and you are the newest student here. Tell me, what do you know about your heritage?” he asks. My eyes are transfixed on his hands as he unbuttons the cuffs of his shirt and rolls up each sleeve to expose some impressive forearms. A throat clearing snaps me out of my trance.
“Oh… um,” I start, embarrassed at being caught staring. “Sorry, I'm a little lost here. I'm not feeling myself,” I say with a sigh and flop down onto the couch. I try to process what the he-ll is going on.
“Due to your circumstances, I am going to assume you know nothing. Here at Greys Academy, our students are gifted…” he begins.
“Wait, gifted?” I interrupt, “I think there's been a mistake. I'm not gifted, I got a pass in all my exams but nothing that makes me stand out,”
“If you'd let me finish Miss Banks…”
“Josie,” I correct, not liking the way he uses ‘Miss Banks’ in an inferior way.
“Miss Banks,” he reiterates, “If you would just keep quiet for two minutes and let me explain then you can be on your way. Our Academy is for what we call Greys. Greys are a race of superhumans. Whilst we are much more powerful than regular humans, we are also small in number. For this reason, we have created our own realm within the human one. This is safer for everyone to live in peace. Somehow, you have slipped through the net and grown up within the human realm. I will be launching a full investigation into how that came to pass, but for now, you are here and you are safe. Now I appreciate this is a lot for you to take in and you have a lot of catching up to do so I won't overwhelm you today. I will have my assistant assign you a dorm room and pair you with one of our more intellectual students to do extra studies with you outside of your regular lessons. I will also schedule some extra studies with our tutors here. Any questions?” he says without a flicker of a smile.
“Oh, you are good,” I laugh. “I love this show! I used to watch it all the time,” I say between bouts of laughter. I get up and start exploring the room to find the hidden cameras. I can't believe I'm on the prank show. I wonder who nominated me, it must have been Freya, my best friend from college. “Was it Freya that put you up to this?” I giggle.
“Miss Banks!” the actor playing Mr Collins shouts, slamming his hand down on the desk, which just makes me laugh harder. I approach him and examine the buttons on his shirt, one must be a hidden camera. Then I start rubbing my hands over his shirt, feeling for the hidden wires. In a flash his hands wrap around my wrists, making me gasp in shock as he grips them hard, stopping my exploration. I look up at him and his eyes are intense as they stare back at me. “What the he-ll are you doing?” he asks in an almost growl.
“Looking for your mic?” I gulp.
“I don't have a mic, this is not a prank. You are new here and you've had a lot to take in so this once I will give you a pass, but if you lay your hands on me ever again there will be punishment. Do you understand?” he says in a low, scary tone. His heavy breathing makes me bite my tongue because I really want to taunt him about what this punishment might be. As if he knows what I'm thinking his eyes seem to flash blue. That's when I remember them doing that earlier, right before he demanded that I sleep, a demand I was powerless to resist. Panic bubbles inside me at the realisation. He's telling the truth, isn't he?
“You made me go to sleep,” I say with a shaky breath. He gives me a single nod in response. “What else can you make me do?” I ask. Fear at how vulnerable I am right now pushes me to ask the question.
“Anything,” he says in a husky whisper, and I swear his face moves closer to mine. His answer doesn't scare me like it should, if anything it excites me. Then a door opens, breaking the trance he has me in, he drops my wrists and takes a step back as if I'm suddenly repulsive to him. I turn to see who the intruder is.

Chapter 4
“I thought I heard voices in here. Is everything okay Dee?” a very attractive woman who looks to be in her thirties says as she walks into the room with a beaming smile. Her hair is jet black and shines as the sunlight hits it. It's the sort of hair that should be in shampoo ads and just enhances her stunning blue eyes and flawless skin. She wears a skin-tight black dress that shows off her hourglass figure and black stilettos, with her finger and toenails painted bright red. She is the kind of woman that makes you feel insecure as soon as you see her.
“Yes. Clarrisa, this is Josie Banks, a new student I've just picked up from the human realm. Could you please assign her one of the single dorm rooms in Ruby,” Mr Collins says, whilst he takes out the file from his briefcase that the police officer had given him earlier and holds it out to Clarrisa.
“Are you sure? There's plenty of space for her in Amber or Saphire,” Clarrisa says, giving me an assessing look up and down before scrunching her nose a little.
“Put her in Ruby please and make sure she has everything she needs,” he says dismissively. Then he sits at his desk and opens up a laptop. I stand there unsure of what I’m supposed to do now. Mr Collins glances up at Clarrisa and then me. “That will be all,” he grunts.
“Of course Deacon, Josie follow me please,” Clarrisa smiles tightly.
“But…” I start.
“That will be all Miss Banks, Clarrisa will get you everything you need and someone will be along to your dorm shortly to answer all your questions and get you settled. Welcome to Greys Academy. I hope there will be no need for any more visits to my office,” Mr Collins says flatly and then turns his attention back to his laptop. With a sigh, I follow perfect Clarrisa.
We exit the office into a glass-lined corridor, Clarrisas heels click loudly on the cream marble floor. Everything feels too bright and shiny. I'd hate to be the cleaner here, there must be a whole army of cleaners to keep all the glass and marble clean. Clarrisa leads me to an elevator and I let an audible breath as I remember my last elevator ride before I was kidnapped by a hot, rude of a… wizard? Then I snort laugh as I think about what is happening. I'm in freaking Hogwarts, and that makes Mr Collins Professor Dumbledore. Clarrisa gives me a disapproving side-eye.
“Sorry, it's been a wild day,” I explain.
“I can imagine. Don't worry about Deacon, he was taking his morning shower when the call came in about you, he had to rush off without his morning coffee, he's grumpy without his coffee,” she laughs, a little too much for it to be real. My mind is suddenly filled with thoughts of Mr Collins in the shower, then I realise what she said. If she was there when he got the call, that means she was there when he was showering. She's his girlfriend… or wife. Of course, she is, she is beautiful and he is hot as he-ll, they are a perfect match. That explains why he jumped away from me like I was on fire, he didn't want his girlfriend to get the wrong idea. My heart sinks a little. I thought I'd felt some chemistry in our short encounter, but I guess it was a wro thought anyway. I'm his student now, and I don't know how things work here but I'm sure it's the same as it is in the human world. Students and teachers dating is a huge no. Why am I wasting time thinking about this when my life has just been completely obliterated?
“Wait!” I blurt. “I need to go back… my mum,” I manage to say through panicked breaths. How could I forget about my mum? Guilt floods me.
“Don't worry about any of that for now, time works differently here so no one will be missing you yet. Deacon will take care of everything, your mum will be just fine. I'm sure he will keep you updated on personal matters like that,” she smiles.
“Okay,” I nod. “What about my stuff? Can I go back for it?” I ask.
“Deacon will arrange for your belongings to get to you, try not to worry and just focus on making your new life here. I know this is a difficult time but I'm sure you will be happy here, we will work everything out to make this transition as easy as possible for you,” she says as we walk through a maze of glass and marble corridors. We exit the building into a courtyard with a huge fountain in the middle. The water comes out through four spouts. Above each spout is a large crystal. Clarrisa stops walking for a moment to let me look at it. “Each crystal represents a house at our Academy. You have been assigned to Ruby for the time being,” she motions to the red stone. “You can easily identify your fellow house students by the colour of their tie. Red for Ruby, green for Emerald, blue for Sapphire and yellow for Amber,” she explains as we walk on. I mentally roll my eyes at the thought of wearing a uniform again. I'm almost 19 years old and I feel like I'm going back to secondary school.
“Where are the other students?” I ask, taking note of how quiet it is.
“They are all in classes, they'll be finishing soon. We have just over 300 students here, it can get quite busy between classes,” she grimaces. Movement in the distance catches my eye and I can just make out a group of about thirty people. They're moving fast around each other as if dancing. As we get closer I realise they're fighting.
“Combat training,” Clarrisa comments, “they're our next squad of soldiers,” she adds proudly. I want to get a closer look but Clarrisa ushers me on and towards an old-looking stone building that's embellished with Rubies. “This is your building,” she says as we go through the door. I look around in awe. It's stunning. It's like an old castle inside but with everything you'd expect in a modern house. The large space has stone walls with thick red curtains around the huge windows. Then there are couches scattered around a large rug with a stone fireplace and real fire. There is a big flatscreen TV mounted to one of the walls with game consoles on the shelves underneath it. On each side of the room is a grand staircase that meets at the top. I follow Clarrisa up the stairs and down a hall, we pass two doors before she stops and hands me a key. “This one is yours, I'll give you some time to settle in and someone will be along shortly to show you around,” she smiles and walks away before I can even mutter a thank-you or get the door open.

Chapter 5
I stand in the doorway of my new room open-mouthed. This must be a mistake. This is nothing you'd expect of a dorm. This is more like a hotel suite. The bed is huge, king-size at least, and the pillows are like plush clouds that I just want to jump into. There is a dressing table with a mirror and a walk-in wardrobe that's almost as big as my entire dorm room at Mount University. The large window is framed by bookshelves, stacked with books of every genre you could wish for, and there's a cosy window seat with cushions and a blanket. I almost squeal in excitement. There's a small countertop with tea and coffee-making facilities and a mini fridge. In the bathroom, there's not only a shower but a full-size bathtub. The whole place is a luxury that I've only ever seen on TV and I have no idea how I am going to pay for it because I don't think a part-time job around my studies is going to cut it. I catch a glimpse of myself in the bathroom mirror and cringe. My hair is a mess, and I'm wearing a sleep shirt with shorts and my tatty Converse shoes that Officer Shelby had allowed me to put on before taking me to the station. I look completely out of place here. On the back of the bathroom door, I notice a bathrobe and there's a stack of towels and toiletries in the bathroom cupboard. It's not ideal but I could shower and change into the robe for the time being. I hope my belongings are brought to me soon because I'm going to be the laughingstock of the school if I have nothing but a bathrobe and sleepwear in my wardrobe. After a hot shower, I feel a million times better. I wrap myself in the luxury robe and head over to the bookshelves to check out the selection. Jumping into someone else’s crazy world sounds like a great distraction whilst I wait for someone to bring my things and introduce me to my new life. A book titled ‘Greys’ catches my eye and whilst it's not the fiction I was hoping for it looks like a good place to start learning about my new life. I climb into the window nook and start reading. I learned that Greys are a superhuman race that possess powers that include but are not limited to; super strength, manifestation, teleportation, shapeshifting, superior speed, compulsion, telepathy and telekinesis. I blow out a breath and close the book, already feeling overwhelmed and not sure if I can believe all this. Voices outside my window catch my attention and I lean closer to look down at the ground outside. There's a group of men heading towards my building, they push and shove each other playfully and as they get closer I notice how dirty and dishevelled they look. Maybe they were a part of the group that was combat training earlier. The men file into the door beneath my room and out of sight, except for one. From this angle, I can't see much of his features but he looks tall with a mess of blonde hair that's long on the top but shaved on the sides. He seems puzzled as he turns around and scans his surroundings, maybe he's looking for someone. I glance in the direction he's looking to see if I can see anyone he might be waiting for but there's no one else in sight. I look back at the man and gasp, jumping back from the window when I see him staring straight at me. I swear his eyes flashed blue like Mr Collins had right before he'd used his powers on me. Once I've composed myself I slowly edge back to the window, peeking over the sill to see if he's still there. I blow out a breath when I find the courtyard empty once again. A knock at my door makes me jump once again. Why am I so jumpy all of a sudden? Actually, that's a dumb question. I've literally been dragged from my life and dumped into a whole new realm, where the people have powers and can command me to do whatever they like. I need to keep my guard up and my wits about me if I'm going to survive in this place. I open the door expecting to see Mr Collins, Clarrisa or someone delivering my belongings, but the face that greets me is none of those. It's the blonde man I'd seen through my window.
“Well hello there new girl,” he grins at me with the most perfect white teeth.
“Hi,” I respond awkwardly, gripping the front of my robe to make sure I'm not flashing anything I don't want him to see. I hear footsteps coming down the corridor and the blonde man rushes into my room and closes the door behind him, almost knocking me over in the process.
“What the he-ll?” I demand, trying not to show any fear.
“Shh,” he says quietly, putting a finger to his mouth. I'm about to start shouting at him to get out when I hear voices on the other side of the door. When the voices seem to pass by the blonde chuckles. “Sorry, I wanted to talk to you before the rest of the guys find out you're here, I’m Theo Henry, your new neighbour,” he explains and holds out a hand to shake. I bite nervously on my lower mouth debating if I should trust this guy. “I don't bite,” he assures, obviously noticing my hesitation. I look into his eyes and see kindness there. Something deep inside me tells me I can trust him, that he's going to be an important part of my new life here.
“I'm Josie,” I finally say, taking his outstretched hand and shaking it. His eyes flash blue and his eyes go wide as a jolt of fear flows through me right before everything goes black.

Chapter 6
My vision returns as fast as it left. Theo is on the floor at my feet sounding.
“What was that?” I demand, stepping back from Theo and clutching my hand.
“The spark,” Theo gro-ans out, and then he starts laughing.
“What does…” I start, but I'm cut off by my door shattering into pieces. Making me shriek and jump back further. A very angry-looking man stands in my doorway, breathing heavily. He takes in the scene in front of him. Dark hair hangs over his eyes but it doesn't hide the fury peeking out behind the dark locks. His hand shoots out towards me and his fingers strain as if he is gripping something, then my oxygen is cut off. I scratch at my neck, trying to remove whatever is wrapped around it that's stopping me from breathing but there's nothing there.
“Mason stop, I'm fine,” Theo croaks out and pushes himself to his feet before knocking the dark-haired man's arm down. Precious air fills my lungs and I collapse to my knees in relief.
“Josie, are you okay?” Theo asks, knee-ling in front of me.
“Get… out!” I rasp between deep breaths.
“Let me get you checked over by a nurse,” Theo says softly, reaching out and touching my neck. His touch feels soothing but also hurts my tender skin. I smack his hand away.
“You heard the lady, get out Theo, and take that psycho with you!” a female voice calls. I look up to see a short, pixie-looking girl standing near my door, her hands are on her hips and she looks pissed.
“He didn't mean it, he thought she was hurting me,” Theo explains.
“She was hurting you!” Mason shouts.
“No, it was amazing. It was The Spark,” Theo exclaims excitedly. Pixie girl laughs in disbelief and Mason looks like someone just kil-led his kitten. His eyes land on me again and I swear I see murder there.
“Sure thing lover boy, everyone knows that's a myth. Go take your boyfriend and daydream elsewhere,” she dismisses. “And fix this door!” she adds coming to stand by my side.
“What’s The Spark?” I croak out.
“Forget about that for now, we are starting you with the basics, not myths,” she smiles, holding out her hand for me. I take it and let her pull me to my feet. “I’m Dorothy, but everyone calls me Dot. Mr Collins asked me to be your guide, tutor and bestie,” she announces with a salute. “Okay, you caught me, I lied about the besties part but we are going to be besties, I just feel it,” she almost squeals. I'm a little taken aback by her chirpy attitude and how fast she speaks, especially after just being attacked by the Damon Salvatore wannabe. I look over to my door and Theo and his murderous friend are nowhere to be seen, my door is also restored to its former glory, you'd never guess it had been shattered into a million pieces just moments before.
“My door,” I gasp.
“Mason fixed it, he's a grumpy, possessive guy but he's also fiercely protective and he's great to have around when things get broken, granted it's usually him breaking them, but nobody is perfect,” she says with a shrug.
“If I ask you something, will you be honest with me because I'm about ready to lose it,” I ask as I begin pacing my room.
“Shoo-t,” she chirps, flopping back onto my bed and examining her bright pink nails.
“Is this a mental hospital? Because my mum has psychosis so maybe it's hereditary. After everything that's happened today I'm starting to think I've actually gone insane and all this is a hallucination and I'm a patient here, not a student,” I blurt out.
“Nah, it's a school for Greys. Unless I'm hallucinating too… What if everyone here is having the same hallucination and we all think we are at school but really it's a hospital? And Mr Collins is our hot doctor trying to make us all sane again. That would be hilarious,” she says laughing hysterically. I stare at her wide-eyed until she composes herself.
“Is that possible?” I ask. Almost afraid of what her answer will be.
“Nah. But I do like the idea of Mr Collins being a doctor, I'm going to call him that from now on. Now get dressed, or we will miss dinner, and you don't want to see what happens when I miss dinner,” she smiles sweetly.
“I don't have any clothes,” I say with a grimace. Dot gives me a knowing smile and snaps her fingers.
“Tah-dah,” she grins, and motions to my wardrobe. With a frown, I open the doors and look in awe at the now fully stocked rails.
“How did you do this?” I ask in astonishment.
“Fine, you caught me in a lie again. It wasn't me. Mr Collins told me he had stocked your wardrobe. Girl, you must have made a good impression on him. I've never seen him be so kind,” she says coming to stand beside me and bumping her hi-p against mine.
“Kind?” I snort. “He was anything but kind,” he must have brought this in whilst I was showering. Thank god I didn't walk out without the robe whilst he was here.
“Mmmhmm,” she mocks and pushes past me. She grabs a pair of very short black shorts, a black vest top and a red oversized hoody with Greys Academy embellished on the front. Then she opens a drawer and picks out some underwear before throwing it all at me. “Get dressed, let's go” she makes a shooing motion at me.
I take the clothes into the bathroom and dress quickly. Everything fits perfectly and I wonder how Mr Collins knew my size, especially my underwear. I push the thought of him choosing underwear for me from my mind, not wanting that embarrassment to add to the shitstorm of a day. When I leave the bathroom Dot is holding out a brand-new pair of crisp white Converse, I shove my feet into them and follow Dot out the door, ready to explore my new world.

Chapter 7
We head out of our building and across the courtyard to a more modern brick building where students seem to be filtering from all directions. People stare at me and I see them turning to whisper to each other.
“Hey beautiful,” a deep voice says from behind us and I turn just in time to see Dot swept off of her feet by a tall man with a mess of shoulder-length blonde hair. Before she has a chance to respond, another male approaches. This one is shorter and has a military-style shaved head. He wraps his arms around her, pulling her from the blond man and planting a kiss on her lips. I stare open-mouthed at the scene in front of me, waiting for a fight to start or for Dot to protest, but it doesn't happen.
“Put me down,” Dot giggles and squirms in the man's arms until he releases her. She straightens her clothes and looks back at me. “Josie, this is Marcus,” she points to the blonde, “and this is Cole,” she pats the arm of the second man.
“Nice to meet you,” I smile awkwardly at Marcus before turning my attention to do the same to Cole.
“Where’s Joe and Max?” Dot asks the men who are now walking beside us.
“They came early to get us a table at the front,” Cole answers.
“Oh goody,” Dot claps her hands together in delight. “Tables at the front are first in line for seconds, “ she leans closer and whispers to me as we go into a large dining hall. I feel the eyes of all the students all lock onto me and my steps falter at the gravity of the situation I'm in. I feel like a fish that's been dumped into the shark tank as I recount the words in the book I’d read. These are all Greys, superhumans with powers that could do whatever they like to me and I'd be helpless to stop them. How am I going to survive here?
“Don't worry, they're just curious. It's not often we get new students, especially at our age. Most people here have grown up together,” Dot reassures, linking her arm in mine and guiding me to a large table. The room is not as impressive as I'd imagined. I was expecting Hogwarts and instead, this is a standard college dining hall.
“So this is your new pet?” a handsome black man with shocking blue eyes asks as he stands from the table and pulls Dot into his arms before kissing the top of her head.
“Yes, this is Josie. Josie, this is Joe,” Dot introduces. Joe flashes me a 1000-megawatt smile and holds out his hand to shake. I hesitate, remembering what had happened with Theo.
“Hi,” I do a small awkward wave instead and quickly avert my gaze.
“Babe, I got you a milkshake,” a cheeky-looking dark-haired man interrupts, handing Dot a bottle of strawberry milkshake.
“You know how to treat a girl,” Dot gushes, reaching up on her tiptoes to kiss his cheek, before turning back to me, “this is Maximus,” she grins at me.
“Max,” he corrects with an eye roll followed by a wink.
“I’m Josie,” I smile.
“And what did you get me, Max?” Cole asks, elbowing Max in the ribs playfully. All four men begin teasing each other and making jokes.
“Sorry, they can be a bit much, but I love them,” Dot says wistfully as she watches the men scuffle. “Let's get some food,” she adds, leading me towards a large food counter. She hands me a tray and a plate and takes one for herself before she starts loading food onto it. The food is laid out under hot counters in a self-serve-style buffet. I take a slice of cheese pizza and some fries as we move along the counter.
“So which one are you dating?” I ask, glancing over to the four men who are now seated at the table.
“All of them,” she grins at me.
“What?” I gasp. “How did you pull that off?” I add with a giggle. I take an apple and a bottle of juice and follow Dot back to the table.
“It is how we do things here, take a good look around you,” she laughs. I take a seat beside her and the men get up to get their food. Looking around at the other students I notice distinct groups of one female with up to five men at each table.
“Our population is small and females are rare, so mate bonds are formed. It is usually four men to every woman, but sometimes it's three or five men,” she explains.
“And the men don't get jealous or fight?” I ask, finding all this hard to believe.
“Sometimes at first, but they work it out. Our bonds are not ours to choose. There are a couple of our kind that have the gift of sight, they can detect soulmates and match them together. When a female turns 18 the soul-seer guides her to her bonds,”
“And does anyone get a choice in all this?” I struggle to keep the distaste from my voice. This feels dirty and like exploitation.
“Of course they do, some resist the bonds, but they almost always give in eventually. It's not easy to ignore your soulmate,” she shrugs. I scan the room again. Everyone looks happy in their groups. Then my eyes land on a table at the back. There are only males at that table, and every single one of them is staring right at me.
“Who are they?” I whisper to Dot.
“Those are the unbonded, declared to have no living soulmate within the realm and resigned to a solitary life. You've just given them all a second chance,” she says excitedly. My heart skips a beat when my eyes lock with Mason’s, dread fills me when I see the devil in his eyes as he stares back at me with that murderous look once again.",1,1743370515.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False
1jnn9d1,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelsfree/comments/1jnn9d1/do_you_know_the_title_of_this_novel/,Do you know the title of this novel?,"“Good Morning ladies!” The dorm senior, Jenna, shouts as she makes her way down the corridor of the dorms, banging on each door as she goes. I roll over with a gro-an and stretch to pick up my phone. I read the time and then rub my eyes before checking the time again because there’s no way I read it right. Glancing around the room I feel confident that my eyes are now working correctly and check the time again.
“Mother fluffer!” I curse under my breath. I was right the first time. It’s 5:30 AM! That confirms my suspicions that perfect Jenna with the too-friendly smile is evil. It’s the first day of university and classes start at 9 AM. Why on earth is she waking the whole dorm up at 5:30? I can hear grumbling and cursing from the other girls through the paper-thin walls as Jenna loudly announces that it’s shower time. I grab the pillow and press it over my head to try and block out the noise. I had my alarm set for 8 AM, which would have given me plenty of time to shower and have breakfast before our first class. I manage to block out enough of the noise that I start drifting back to sleep. BANG, BANG, BANG!
“Josie Banks, room number 5, I don’t hear any movement in there!” Jenna’s sickly sweet voice calls through the door as she hammers on it, then she begins to rattle the door handle. With a huff I chuck my pillow on the floor, throw back my covers and get up, stomping to the door I yank it open.
“It is 5:30 AM!” I hiss at Jenna. She smiles with fake sympathy as she looks me up and down.
“I am aware of the time Miss Banks, but this year’s stock is going to need extra time to get ready if we are going to make any of you look presentable,” she grins.
“We are not cattle,” I huff and begin to shut the door in her face. She stops it with a foot in the doorway and looks down at her clipboard.
“Josie Banks, eighteen years old, here to study criminology. Father is deceased, mother suffers from psychosis and currently resides in a secure hospital. Josie needs support to process her emotions and would benefit greatly from structure and routine. Josie has no other living rel…” I cut her off by robing the clipboard from her hand and reading the information sheet she had on me. With every word I read of my personal information, my anger grows, like each letter adds fuel to the already growing fire within me. Who gave her this information? She’s just a senior student with a voluntary role as dorm leader, she has no right or need for this information. This is a breach of privacy.
“How did you get this?” I seeth. Students gather in the corridor, their attention now focused on the drama unfolding in front of them.
“As the dorm leader, I am privy to any information that may help me to support you,” Jenna states, holding her head high like she feels superior. “It was in the enrolment statement, that you signed and agreed to when you accepted your place within this university,” she adds. I tear the page from the clip holding it down and slam the board into her heart.
“You had no right to that information, and you certainly had no right to broadcast it to the whole dorm,” I shout as I shove her away from my door. There’s a brief look of shock on her face as her head cracks against the wall before her expression goes blank and she slumps down to the floor with a thud. There's a distinct crack in the plaster on the wall where she hit it. Gasps sound out down the hall as I slam the door. I lean against it in disbelief, looking down at my hands in disgust.
“Someone call an ambulance!” I hear one of the girls in the hall shout.
How did that just happen? I didn't shove her that hard did I?… no, it's not possible, I'm not that strong and I barely touched her. She must have tripped on something and hit her head. That crack in the wall must have already been there and I'd just not noticed it until now.
“Is she breathing?” I hear a panicked voice ask. I don't hear the answer as my ears begin to ring and my heart begins to pound loudly. I feel as if the oxygen has been svcked out of the room as I draw in gasping lungfuls of useless air. My heart tightens with every breath like more and more weight is being added on top of me. My vision goes blurry before turning completely black, then I become light, and the weight lifts from me as I relax into peaceful darkness.
“Miss Banks wake up!” a stern voice penetrates the blissful bubble of silence I had fallen into. I blink open my eyes, letting my blurry vision adjust to take in the figure hovering above me. It's a plump lady with a grim-faced expression that I don't recognise.
“Who are you?” I murmur, pushing myself up into a sitting position and looking around to take in my surroundings.
“ I'm Officer Shelby, I'm with the Mount University Police. We need to take you down to the station,” she gives me a sympathetic smile as she pulls me up to my feet. In the broken doorway of my room stands another police officer. This one is looking curiously between me, the doorway and the crack in the wall where Jenna had been slumped. I svck in a breath as I remember what had happened. Jenna is no longer there, which is good. I must have passed out for a short time and she had reported me to the police for causing her to fall.
“I'm sorry officer, this was all a bit of a misunderstanding. I didn't mean for her to fall, I just pushed her out of my doorway so I could close my door and…” I begin to explain until the officer holds up a hand to stop me.
“Save it for the interview honey,” she says softly, whilst guiding me out of the building and into the back of a waiting police car. My fellow students watch on, giving looks of pity, smirks and utter disgust as I pass… perfect, I've made a great first impression.

Chapter 2
For the next few hours, I watch the clock in the small room they have me locked in. I’d drank my small paper cup of water hours ago and I've counted every tiny crack I can find in the plastered walls at least ten times. Just when I'm at the point of driving myself completely insane by mentally replaying what happened with Jenna over and over again, the door opens. The male officer that I'd seen in my dorm room earlier walks in and takes the seat opposite me at the table.
“Sorry to keep you waiting Miss Banks,” he says, laying a paper folder out on the table. He opens it and begins to read through it in silence. The seconds tick by and I start to get fidgety in my seat at the uncomfortable silence. Just as I open my mouth to break the silence the door opens again and a tall man wearing an expensive-looking suit walks in holding a briefcase. The man looks down at me in an assessing way. He is extremely good-looking and exudes dominance in a way that makes him hard to look at.
“Is this her?” he says in an almost snort, jer-king his chin in my direction.
“Yes, Sir,” the police officer nods, motioning for the newcomer to sit next to him. He takes his seat and reads through the paperwork the officer hands to him. I study his face as he reads. He's one of those ageless guys. His serious, no-bulllshit demeanour makes him seem like he's much older, but his face is young. My guess is he could be anywhere between twenty and forty. He must feel me looking at him as his eyes flick up to mine over the paper and he holds my gaze. Everything in me screams at me to look away, to break the eye contact, but I don't. I won't be bullied by some stuck-up detective. His eyes grow intense and then I swear I see the flash of a smirk before he slams his hand down on the table, making me jump back in fright.
“Are you trying to challenge me Miss Banks?” he asks in a deeper voice than he'd used with the other officer.
“Challenge you?” I snort and raise an eyebrow, trying to use my attitude to mask how much he had scared me.
“I suggest you learn to submit, and quickly, because at the place you are going, the people won't be as tolerant as I am,” he says, closing the folder and putting it into his briefcase before turning to the officer and nodding. My heart pounds in my heart and panic grips me as I watch the two men shake hands. “I’ll take her from here,” the stuck-up detective tells the officer.
“No,” I manage to rasp out. “Please, I didn't mean to hurt her. I can't go to prison. I can't!… Don't I get a solicitor?… A phone call?” I plead with the officer as he leaves the room. I turn my attention back to the suited man. “Please sir, it was an accident,” I sob.
“Not so tough now are we?” he smirks at me. “Let's go, Miss Banks, I have a very busy schedule and don't have time for your tears,” he sighs and heads towards the door. I remain seated, frozen in fear and shock. “You have two seconds to follow me, otherwise I will leave you here and let the police throw you in prison,” he snaps.
“Wait, what?” I gasp and turn to look at him. He gestures to the open doorway he is standing in and without too much thought I scramble to my feet and rush to his side.
“That's what I thought,” I hear him remark under his breath. He walks down the corridor with large strides that I struggle to keep up with.
“Where are we going?” I whisper to him as we pass police officers who don't seem to pay any attention to us. He ignores me like the rude assh-ole that he is and doesn't even look at me until we reach the elevator. He presses the button and turns to face me whilst we wait for the doors to open.
“Tell me, Miss Banks, are you prone to panic attacks?” He asks
“Huh?” I respond, a little taken aback at this whole situation.
“Your file says you passed out from a suspected panic attack at the scene, and you seem to be on the brink of another panic attack now. So what I am asking, little girl, is if I’m going to have to hold your hand through our journey?” He snarks. Anger flares in me at his words.
“Well I’m sorry Mr Perfect, I’ve had  a day so do excuse me if I’m a little upset!” I hiss at him, crossing my arms to let him know how much of a badass I am. He gives me another of his barely there smirks and a nod in what seems like approval. The elevator dings at that moment,  the doors opening and he steps forward without another word. I follow the smarmy guy in and stand beside him. I watch as the doors  close, with a strange sense that they're closing on my old life.
“Collins,” he says, snapping me out of my strange thoughts I turn to give him a questioning look. “It's Mr Collins,” he says in a barely there whisper as he steps dangerously close and looks down at me. So close that when I take a breath my heart touches his. The air suddenly feels charged as I stare up into Mr Collins’ eyes. The arm holding the briefcase snakes around my back and he pulls me flush against his heart, causing me to gasp. Holy sh-it balls this man is hot. He brings up his other hand and gently strokes my cheek with a secret smile, then in a flash he grips my chin hard. “Sleep,” he demands, his eyes flashing blue as he speaks. My last thought before my body shuts down is that I'm going to knee this jer-k in the balls as soon as I get the opportunity.

Chapter 3
“Wake up, Miss Banks,” a smooth voice says, the tone washes over me like a loving caress, and for the first time in a very long time I feel safe and it's not something I want to wake up from just yet. I nuzzle my face into the warmth against my cheek. A sweet, buttery and woodsy kind of scent hits my nose and I give an approving hum at the pleasing smell. A grunt of disapproval ruins my contentment right before I am dropped unceremoniously onto my back. The landing is soft but still unpleasant.
“What the he-ll!” I curse, rushing to sit and take in my surroundings. I'm on a couch in a dimly lit room, bright light suddenly floods the room making me squint against it. I shift my attention to the source of the light, fighting the urge to hiss at it like a feral vampire. A large figure is framed by the beaming sunlight that is flooding the room through a window that spans the entire wall. The figure is fussing with the curtains that he's just opened and I quickly recognise him as the stuck-up detective, Mr Collins. The events of the day come rushing back to me like a tidal wave of anger, fear and complete confusion.
“What did you do to me? How did we get here?” I demand, gesturing to the room and jumping to my feet.
“I don't have time to baby you through this, so here is the quick version,” he starts as he unbuttons his suit jacket and hangs it over the back of a large leather office chair. “My name is Deacon Collins, I am the headmaster of Grey’s Academy and you are the newest student here. Tell me, what do you know about your heritage?” he asks. My eyes are transfixed on his hands as he unbuttons the cuffs of his shirt and rolls up each sleeve to expose some impressive forearms. A throat clearing snaps me out of my trance.
“Oh… um,” I start, embarrassed at being caught staring. “Sorry, I'm a little lost here. I'm not feeling myself,” I say with a sigh and flop down onto the couch. I try to process what the he-ll is going on.
“Due to your circumstances, I am going to assume you know nothing. Here at Greys Academy, our students are gifted…” he begins.
“Wait, gifted?” I interrupt, “I think there's been a mistake. I'm not gifted, I got a pass in all my exams but nothing that makes me stand out,”
“If you'd let me finish Miss Banks…”
“Josie,” I correct, not liking the way he uses ‘Miss Banks’ in an inferior way.
“Miss Banks,” he reiterates, “If you would just keep quiet for two minutes and let me explain then you can be on your way. Our Academy is for what we call Greys. Greys are a race of superhumans. Whilst we are much more powerful than regular humans, we are also small in number. For this reason, we have created our own realm within the human one. This is safer for everyone to live in peace. Somehow, you have slipped through the net and grown up within the human realm. I will be launching a full investigation into how that came to pass, but for now, you are here and you are safe. Now I appreciate this is a lot for you to take in and you have a lot of catching up to do so I won't overwhelm you today. I will have my assistant assign you a dorm room and pair you with one of our more intellectual students to do extra studies with you outside of your regular lessons. I will also schedule some extra studies with our tutors here. Any questions?” he says without a flicker of a smile.
“Oh, you are good,” I laugh. “I love this show! I used to watch it all the time,” I say between bouts of laughter. I get up and start exploring the room to find the hidden cameras. I can't believe I'm on the prank show. I wonder who nominated me, it must have been Freya, my best friend from college. “Was it Freya that put you up to this?” I giggle.
“Miss Banks!” the actor playing Mr Collins shouts, slamming his hand down on the desk, which just makes me laugh harder. I approach him and examine the buttons on his shirt, one must be a hidden camera. Then I start rubbing my hands over his shirt, feeling for the hidden wires. In a flash his hands wrap around my wrists, making me gasp in shock as he grips them hard, stopping my exploration. I look up at him and his eyes are intense as they stare back at me. “What the he-ll are you doing?” he asks in an almost growl.
“Looking for your mic?” I gulp.
“I don't have a mic, this is not a prank. You are new here and you've had a lot to take in so this once I will give you a pass, but if you lay your hands on me ever again there will be punishment. Do you understand?” he says in a low, scary tone. His heavy breathing makes me bite my tongue because I really want to taunt him about what this punishment might be. As if he knows what I'm thinking his eyes seem to flash blue. That's when I remember them doing that earlier, right before he demanded that I sleep, a demand I was powerless to resist. Panic bubbles inside me at the realisation. He's telling the truth, isn't he?
“You made me go to sleep,” I say with a shaky breath. He gives me a single nod in response. “What else can you make me do?” I ask. Fear at how vulnerable I am right now pushes me to ask the question.
“Anything,” he says in a husky whisper, and I swear his face moves closer to mine. His answer doesn't scare me like it should, if anything it excites me. Then a door opens, breaking the trance he has me in, he drops my wrists and takes a step back as if I'm suddenly repulsive to him. I turn to see who the intruder is.

Chapter 4
“I thought I heard voices in here. Is everything okay Dee?” a very attractive woman who looks to be in her thirties says as she walks into the room with a beaming smile. Her hair is jet black and shines as the sunlight hits it. It's the sort of hair that should be in shampoo ads and just enhances her stunning blue eyes and flawless skin. She wears a skin-tight black dress that shows off her hourglass figure and black stilettos, with her finger and toenails painted bright red. She is the kind of woman that makes you feel insecure as soon as you see her.
“Yes. Clarrisa, this is Josie Banks, a new student I've just picked up from the human realm. Could you please assign her one of the single dorm rooms in Ruby,” Mr Collins says, whilst he takes out the file from his briefcase that the police officer had given him earlier and holds it out to Clarrisa.
“Are you sure? There's plenty of space for her in Amber or Saphire,” Clarrisa says, giving me an assessing look up and down before scrunching her nose a little.
“Put her in Ruby please and make sure she has everything she needs,” he says dismissively. Then he sits at his desk and opens up a laptop. I stand there unsure of what I’m supposed to do now. Mr Collins glances up at Clarrisa and then me. “That will be all,” he grunts.
“Of course Deacon, Josie follow me please,” Clarrisa smiles tightly.
“But…” I start.
“That will be all Miss Banks, Clarrisa will get you everything you need and someone will be along to your dorm shortly to answer all your questions and get you settled. Welcome to Greys Academy. I hope there will be no need for any more visits to my office,” Mr Collins says flatly and then turns his attention back to his laptop. With a sigh, I follow perfect Clarrisa.
We exit the office into a glass-lined corridor, Clarrisas heels click loudly on the cream marble floor. Everything feels too bright and shiny. I'd hate to be the cleaner here, there must be a whole army of cleaners to keep all the glass and marble clean. Clarrisa leads me to an elevator and I let an audible breath as I remember my last elevator ride before I was kidnapped by a hot, rude of a… wizard? Then I snort laugh as I think about what is happening. I'm in freaking Hogwarts, and that makes Mr Collins Professor Dumbledore. Clarrisa gives me a disapproving side-eye.
“Sorry, it's been a wild day,” I explain.
“I can imagine. Don't worry about Deacon, he was taking his morning shower when the call came in about you, he had to rush off without his morning coffee, he's grumpy without his coffee,” she laughs, a little too much for it to be real. My mind is suddenly filled with thoughts of Mr Collins in the shower, then I realise what she said. If she was there when he got the call, that means she was there when he was showering. She's his girlfriend… or wife. Of course, she is, she is beautiful and he is hot as he-ll, they are a perfect match. That explains why he jumped away from me like I was on fire, he didn't want his girlfriend to get the wrong idea. My heart sinks a little. I thought I'd felt some chemistry in our short encounter, but I guess it was a wro thought anyway. I'm his student now, and I don't know how things work here but I'm sure it's the same as it is in the human world. Students and teachers dating is a huge no. Why am I wasting time thinking about this when my life has just been completely obliterated?
“Wait!” I blurt. “I need to go back… my mum,” I manage to say through panicked breaths. How could I forget about my mum? Guilt floods me.

Overall had a great time because of the people i met there. There were a whole bunch of RSVP notifications that I missed because of the timezone difference, it would be helpful if that was kept in mind. A day or so before the event i felt like i had already missed everything interesting and questioned why i was attending. (im glad that I still did). But keep in mind, not everyone is in CT timezone. 

2. I got a platinum badge and didnt get to use a single sxxpress pass. It would always open at 9am and that was usually when i was on my way, walking furiously to the first event of the day - it was either stop and sxxpress or go do the thing i was there for. Maybe open that up around 6pm - 9pm in the evenings?

3. Schedule : the film schedule was designed well. You could see what else was happening parallely and pick the best ones in the timeslot. For the conference though, everyone i know was complaining about how much content they had to scroll through to get to the next time slot. 

There is a hack where you can favorite it all, export, sync to a calendar and then look at it. Or to save everyone some trouble, lay it horizontally. Fully understand that mobile has limitations, but atleast on a desktop it should have a more efficient layout.

Bonus: I am still wondering why i got a platinum badge. I don't see it having enough value. I was hanging out with a group which had film badgws, interactive badges and music badges - dont think there was ever once when i could get access to something they couldnt (maybe the refresh lounges - but they were always out of coffee).

1jnn7to,https://www.reddit.com/r/finedining/comments/1jnn7to/peru_travel_food_review_march_2025/,Peru Travel Food Review (March 2025),"Here are highlights from my 2025 Peru Trip dining.  I struggled quite a bit on what to prioritize given limited time and space to eat and here is some big picture feedback in case it help anyone else. 

  


The absolute can’t miss spots from my perspective are **Merito** and **MIL**, which have to be tied for the favorites on our trip.  I struggled quite a bit on whether to do **Kjolle** or **Central** and did not end up going to Central.  I have some slight FOMO after the meal at MIL.  ***If we end up in Peru again, I won’t miss MIL, Merito, and Central (possibly Kjolle if enough time not to overload on tasting menus).***  My comments on the longer tasting menus are more detailed than spots we ordered individual dishes.  I will post a few full reviews in the coming days with pictures.  Happy to answer any questions as well. 

  


**Merito 10/10** 

* \-every dish was a hit, super flavorful (flavor pop after flavor), great textures, good progression.  Literally every dish got a “wow” reaction.  A few absolute standouts were the lamb raviolis, the Andean curry fish, the scallops, and the coconut loche.  Neither my wife nor I were particularly hungry after having done Kjolle (with drinks) the night before, so we were hesitant about a tasting menu, but everything was incredible and we had huge smiles the entire meal.  
* \-good environment, casual fun, but extremely professional staff that explained dishes well and we were always happy to see at our table. 

  


**MIL 10/10** 

* \-incredible experience and must be the peak of highlighting a local area’s cuisine.  Flavors were very “true” and the ingredients themselves were the star of the show, but were in no means subdued (as I’ve seen at other spots where you get a “plain, bland X”).  An absolute standout of the meal was the alpaca tartare, with all the ingredients together felt like an Andean gyro.  So much flavor, texture, and perfect combo. The simple corn and potato dishes set the bar for these ingredients. The first dessert was amazing
* \-very peaceful and enjoyable environment.  The staff was warm and inviting.  While it does have a peaceful, quiet vibe, it wasn’t clinical and awkward like we felt Kjolle was. Servers were amazing as was the Matter researcher and chefs we met. 

  


**Kjolle 9/10** 

* \-Third best experience of the trip.  The food seemed half balanced on highlighting ingredients with blending for flavors.  Food was incredible and there were as many, if not more wow hits as MIL.  The looking style was a bit richer than MIL, but less flavor forward than Merito, but I loved this meal.  Highlights were the “many tubers” potato combo (incredible flavor and textures), the lobster and crab dish, and the rib.  Kjolle’s dessert might be the best dessert I’ve ever eaten with three dishes combined (I finished my wife’s) 
* \-service and atmosphere was a bit off for us.  The dining room was sterile and had spa-meditation music that didn’t match the extremely brightly lit room.  Service was friendly, but a bit mechanical and there was at least one mis-communication to English where we weren’t told to combine the duck/urchin dishes together and it resulted in a very salty dish and a sweet dish on their own (we saw another table had it explained to them)  

  


**Mayta 7.5/10** 

* \-we did Mayta for a la carte lunch and had a nice experience.  The scallop dish was very strong, the urchine vegetable pasta was ok. Lomo saltado recommended by the staff was solid, but didn’t wow. The chocolate dessert was amazing and shouldn’t be missed.  
* \-staff was fun and environment casual 

  


**Cosme 7/10** 

* \-went for a light lunch, tacos were good, flan was amazing, and another chocolate dessert was ok, would recommend for a light lunch and the flan 

  


**Tomo 6/10** 

* \-overall ok, but perception might reflect Peruvian sushi more broadly, which seems to incorporate a lot of sauces and sweet elements that can take away from the fish.  Fish was all high quality, but not quite to our palettes.  Servers were great with my wife’s gluten allergy.  

  


**Astrid & Gaston 5/10** 

* \-maybe we went on an off day, but we were not impressed with A&G.  My wife and I got separate scallop dishes and both thought our scallops were off (we later had digestive issues).   The pot pie and cannoli dishes I had were good though.  Service by the kitchen was extremely slow (our waiter was great though). 

  


**Additional highlights:**

* **Lady Bee** was great.  Creative cocktails, fun vibes, and fun staff. 
* **Belmont Miraflores hotel bar** 
* **Demo Coffee** (Merito’s flan for breakfast!) ",1,1743370300.0,finedining,0,1.0,False

## key Differences: QC45 vs. QuietComfort (2025) at a glance

While sharing a common ancestor, the Bose QC45 and the quietcomfort (2025) headphones do have notable differences. This isn't just a matter of aesthetics; the enhancements impact performance, features, and ultimately, your listening experience. Let's break down the most meaningful variations:

*   **Sound quality:** The quietcomfort (2025) boasts improved sound processing and drivers, offering a slightly more refined and balanced audio profile compared to the QC45.While the QC45 delivers a clear and enjoyable sound, the QuietComfort (2025) provides a richer and more detailed listening experience, even though opinions on whether that difference justifies the added expense vary.
*   **Noise Cancellation:** Both headphones are excellent at blocking out ambient noise, but the QuietComfort (2025) features an enhanced noise cancellation algorithm and an ""aware Mode"" (transparency mode) that sounds more natural and allows you to hear your surroundings without removing the headphones. The QC45 provides a solid noise-canceling experience but lacks the same level of sophistication in its transparency mode.
*   **Design & Comfort:** The overall design is similar; both prioritize comfort. However the QuietComfort (2025), according to some users, has a slightly more refined headband and earcups providing heightened long wear comfort.*   **Battery Life:** The battery life is very close but with minor advantage in bose QuietComfort battery life. the QuietComfort (2025) can provide up to 24 hours of listening with ANC enabled, while the QC45 offers around 22 hours.

## A Deep Dive into Sound Quality: Hear the Difference

Let’s address the core concern for any audio enthusiast: sound quality. The Bose QC45 delivers a balanced and pleasing sound signature. bass is present without being overpowering,mids are clear,and highs are crisp. This makes it suitable for a wide variety of music genres. However, some users find the sound profile slightly less detailed and nuanced compared to higher-end headphones.

The Bose QuietComfort (2025) aims to address this with improved drivers and sound processing. The result is a more refined and dynamic soundstage. The bass is tighter, the mids are more detailed, and the highs are clearer without being harsh. This translates to a more immersive and engaging listening experience, allowing you to appreciate the subtle nuances in your favorite tracks. For audiophiles or those who prioritize sound fidelity, the QuietComfort (2025) offers a noticeable advantage.Though, for casual listeners, the difference might not be significant enough to justify the price difference of the best deal on Bose QuietComfort vs. bose qc45.

## Conquer the Noise: Noise Cancellation Showdown

Bose built its reputation on noise cancellation, and both the QC45 and QuietComfort (2025) excel in this area. They effectively block out a wide range of ambient noises, from the drone of airplane engines to the chatter in a busy coffee shop.

The QC45 offers two primary noise cancellation modes: ""Quiet"" (full noise cancellation) and ""Aware"" mode (transparency mode). The ""Quiet"" mode is highly effective, creating a peaceful bubble around you. Though, the ""aware"" mode on the QC45 can sound a bit artificial, amplifying external sounds in a way that doesn't always feel natural.The QuietComfort (2025) steps up the game with an improved noise cancellation algorithm that adapts to your habitat more intelligently. It also features advancements in ""Aware"" mode sound processing. The effect is a more natural and balanced transparency mode, allowing you to have conversations and be aware of your surroundings without feeling like you're wearing headphones. The overall noise cancellation is also a touch more effective,particularly in challenging environments with unpredictable sound patterns.For frequent travelers or those who rely heavily on noise cancellation in diverse settings,the QuietComfort (2025) offers a noticeable enhancement.[[Explore Top Rated bose quietcomfort 45 vs quietcomfort on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/bose-700/?kw=bose quietcomfort 45 vs quietcomfort)
## Comfort is Key: A Headphone You Can Wear All Day

Comfort is a critical factor, especially for headphones designed for extended wear. Both the Bose QC45 and QuietComfort (2025) prioritize comfort with their lightweight design, plush earcups, and adjustable headbands.

The QC45 is known for its cozy fit, and many users report being able to wear them for hours without discomfort. The earcups provide ample cushioning and effectively seal around the ears without feeling too tight. The headband is also well-padded and distributes weight evenly.

The QuietComfort (2025) builds upon this foundation with subtle but impactful refinements.Some users find the earcups slightly more spacious and the headband padding slightly more considerable, leading to even greater comfort, particularly during long listening sessions. Though, the difference is marginal, and both models offer exceptional comfort for extended use, thus making ""bose qc45 vs qc comfort"" a tight comparison.

No drinking, smoking, or drugs. Occasionally taking a multivitamin when I remember, occasionally drink coffee (once or twice a month)(trying to limit caffeine intake since it spikes my heart rate). 400mg (2 200mg tablets) ibuprofen when needed for rheumatoid arthritis & ankylosing spondylitis flareups (dx with both at 12, had symptoms since 9). OCD + PTSD diagnosed. 

Formally on the medication Prazosin 2mg every 12 hours, later halved to 1mg every 12 hours to treat PTSD---diagnosed at given this medication at 16, took it for 6-8 months before stopping. Within an hour of first taking this medication, my resting heart rate jumped from 60bpm to 80bpm (I had somatic obsession with my heart rate at the time). I asked to stop the medication, but due to being in a psychiatric facility at the time, they told me that they would mark me as uncooperative if I didn't continue taking it despite the side effect. I should have advocated for myself more but there isn't much someone stuck in the troubled-teen industry can do, especially since my mom temporarily signed custody rights over to the facility. (They were later shut-down for mistreatment)

My resting heart rate did not immediately return to normal after stopping the medication. I only got back down to 60-70bpm resting in February.

I only really became aware of the problem because I got a mi-band for Christmas last year and have something constantly tracking my heart rate. I have taken videos of me standing and watching the heart rate monitor go from 70 to 120. Admittedly, I am not as active as I was pre-pandemic, so I would understand if my heart wasn't as used to being worked out, but this just seems excessive. I am trying to get back on the wagon, though.

 I have a friend with POTS, so I know a bit about the disorder. I do not think that it's POTS because I do not feel faint when my heart-rate spikes; I only feel faint if I haven't eaten in a few hours. Sometimes I do feel like I can't breathe, but not always.

I'm hoping that exercising more will help, but I'm also a bit nervous that it might exacerbate the issue. I'm sticking mainly to walking, hiking, and yoga for now but I want to try and do light weights since it helps with my arthritis (and I want muscles lol).

*Situation*
I have worked in my current cafe now for 12 months. It is a very busy environment within a very busy retail park here in the UK. The store I work at has had 4 managers in 14 months since the store originally opened! I am second in command at the store and i have worked there since day 1. In total we have had a store manager for 7 weeks in total in 14 months, meanwhile i have been running the store on just above minimum wage the whole time. The issue I have is that I like the team, I like the customers and I do enjoy the job, but I am being taken advantage of, I have worked it out that the business owners have saved £16,000 in 14 months by me doing the role! What would you do if this were you, I am ready to walk away.

*Business Owners*
They do not listen…. They come in a few times a week to complain about things, we are very short staffed and we do our best but when we have 300+ orders a day with 3 people on shift something has to give.

We’ve been through a lot, but lately, I’m starting to wonder if it’s time to cut her off. We were hanging out at a coffee shop the other day, just like we always do, and when it came time to pay, she pulls the classic move ""Oops I forgot my wallet"" Now, I’ve been falling for this trick for way too long. Every single time we hang out, it’s the same thing, she forgets her wallet, and I end up paying for her stuff. She knows I’ll always do it because I feel guilty saying no. But this time? I had had enough.I flat-out told her I wasn’t paying for her this time. She starts with the usual, ""Do you not have enough? Are you seriously not going to pay?"" and I’m sitting there, boiling with frustration. Like, no. I wasn’t going to let her pull that crap again. I didn’t even try to stay calm. I just snapped. I started yelling at her, right there in the coffee shop. I didn’t care who was looking, I was just done. I told her exactly how I felt, that I was sick of being manipulated, that I wasn’t her personal ATM. Of course, she tried to turn it around on me, like I was the crazy one. ""You’re really gonna act like this in public?"" she said. But honestly, I didn’t care. I was finally standing up for myself. The thing is, I *really* want to cut ties with her. She’s always pulling me back in with her apologies and excuses, making me forget all the crap she’s done. And I do forget, that is, but I pretend like I do because I still have feelings for her.

One of the people who showed up was a 30 yo woman also learning Italian. 

She showed up a second time and somewhere along in the conversation, the topic of organising times/days came up. She asked to exchange numbers, and to not be awkward by saying no because I have a gf (as if to suggest she was hitting on me) I said sure and gave her mine. 

That was that.

A couple of weeks later (today) she texts me saying ""Hey X! It's Y. Sorry I can't make the exchange at that day/time. If you want to get a coffee another day let me know"".

Do I just say ""hey no worries"" and then not reply to the coffee. Thing. Do I tell her I have a gf and I don't think it would be appropriate? Again, at the risk of her thinking that I'm suggesting that she is hitting on me.

I’ve imagined doing something like this for many years now, I just haven’t had the time or motivation to make it happen. I also didn't know how well it would be received. I originally decided to allow submissions for a week because I thought they might trickle in, but little did I know /r/tea was full of poets and I needed the full week to evaluate all the entries. While I received more submissions than I bargained for, I promise I did read every single one, many of them multiple times. It was truly a wonderful experience to spend many hours alone with your poetry and my thoughts. It was also a privilege and an honor to be given a peek into your lives. There was an abundance of passion, love, humor, creativity, and vulnerability. Through your poems I was able to sit down and virtually share tea with many fascinating strangers. This was a wonderful gift. 





Before sharing the winners, here an update and overview of the submissions. I also wanted to give a few shout outs to some folks who made me laugh, taught me something, and one individual who added some serious perspective to the struggles others are facing in the world today.

**Total Unique Haiku - 903**

**Unique Authors - 382**


**Avg - 2.38 submissions per user**



.



**Dominant themes**


Tea (obviously), brewing methods, sensory experience, connectedness, nature, feelings of peace and well being, contemplative aspects. There were also quite a lot of haiku about either accidentally burning yourselves, or forgetting about your tea entirely. Not sure what that says about us here at /r/tea but there’s definitely a theme of trying to strive for mindfulness while simultaneously being distracted and suffering some small consequences as a result - something we can all relate to.

Second, I’d like to give shout outs to our court jesters. These poems caused me to genuinely laugh out loud. I wanted to surface these up to the top and hopefully share some laughs with the community. For me, these stood out being peppered into the seriousness of the other haiku. Many times these caught me off guard and also provided much needed comic relief during the hours I spent reading and analyzing the entries. Special shoutout to  /u/TranscendentPajamas having four poems that made the Sokka List. I’ve added 2 entries for every haiku that made it onto this list, up to a maximum of 4 bonus entries.

**Next we have our Prolific Poets, our Syllable Senseis:**





/u/ViridianLinwood - 31 entries



/u/Soulcycl0ne - 23 entries




/u/Monday_or_Tuesday - 19 entries






As of writing this I have not done the random drawing. For math nerds out there, odds of winning the random drawing is approximately 1-(1-([number of submitted entries]/[total number of entries]))^[number of drawings]. This comes out to about a 0.63% chance per entry, after accounting for the “bonus entries” I’ve added. This is approximately 18%, 14.3%, 13.75% change to win respectively for our finger cramp champions. While I do not award you any bonus entries for this, I commend your commitment and wish you best of luck in the drawing!




.




On a more serious note, I’d like to call out /u/bestia- The poems you wrote hit me really hard. I think it’s very easy to lose perspective on what is important in life. While everyone has problems of their own and I do not want to diminish them, many of the problems we face day to day in peaceful nations are often just small inconveniences. We do not have to worry about being bombed in the middle of the night or if this cup of tea may be our last. This is a great reminder that sitting down with a simple cup of tea without these kinds of worries is a luxury and a privilege we should all appreciate more than we do. I’ve included the link that /u/bestia- shared as part of their entry. This website is the official government website for Ukraine, if you decide to donate you can be sure this will be going to the right place. /u/bestia- I salute and deeply respect the bravery of all those fighting for your country. Slava Ukraine.

**A few other things…**



Because the turnout was so high, and many of you expressed gratitude for the exercise. I wanted to point out that Ito En makers of the delicious bottled Oi Ocha green tea runs an annual Haiku contest. They have run this contest since 1989 and are currently on the 36th annual contest!



[https://itoen-shinhaiku.jp/en/](https://itoen-shinhaiku.jp/en/)  



It’s free to enter, you can read through past winners on the website. Winners get their Haiku printed on the bottle! Which is pretty cool. I wanted to share the website and also the Haiku from one of my favorite winners


>freshly mown grass

>clinging to my shoes

>my muddled thoughts

>
>
>- **Gracie Starkey, age 12**
>

>The judges comments: This is a very unique and fresh poem. After a squall has passed, the author is walking across a freshly cut lawn and some grass gets onto the bottom of their shoes. The subtly differently colored blades of grass create a random pattern on the bottom of the shoes. Thinking about life while walking across the lawn, the author happened to notice the pattern created on their shoes, and comes to think of it as reflecting their own complicated thinking. The expression 'muddled thoughts' is especially skillfully used.

.


**My Judging Process**


This is a good segue into my judging process. While I’m not an expert by any means, I did need to go through nearly 1000 haiku. For transparency and those who care, I wanted to share a bit about my process. I started with simply reading the entries and seeing if it made me feel something. Did it make me feel an emotion? Was I able to visualize a place or a feeling? Did I feel a sense of depth or mystery? In a Google Sheet I captured how each one made me feel and also some of my thoughts. I posted many of these thoughts and reactions as replies. 


After this first round, I went back and re-read with some more scrutiny on some traditional Haiku criteria. Reference to the seasons (or time frame), inclusion of a Kireji or “cutting word” that breaks the Haiku into two distinct parts. Did it include a theme and juxtaposition? Was there simplicity and yugen? - Each word should be purposeful, no wasted words. Now I didn’t get too in the weeds here, but I did keep these in the back of my mind while I was choosing my favorites. I also made note of how many poems I was drawn to by each author. For example - If an author wrote 10 entries and 8 of them I really connected with, I took this into account when choosing winners. This was an iterative process that I did many times throughout the week. This allowed me to react in the moment to the entries and also sit with them over a longer period of time to see how I felt about them later. This brought me down to a list of about 35 Haiku that I sat with for quite some time. I updated this list as folks continued to submit poems. Ultimately, the three winners I have chosen both have individual poems which are fantastic, and also a collection of submissions that I felt were a cut above. I’m highlighting a few of their entries here, but I encourage you to read all their entries. So without further ado…



.

**1st Place - /u/midnight_aurora**

>How wonderful this


>Tiny understanding with


>a kindred spirit



I felt this haiku really captured this whole experience for me. A tiny poem that gives a wonderful moment and connection between people. Each haiku told a story, and allowed me to connect with people I do not know. It was wonderful.

.


>Of all the lies I


>Tell myself, the greatest one


>Is that I should fear



Fear is the mind killer. While I don’t condone massive risks, I tend to be a bit more conservative and I think this Haiku is a great reminder that fear is such a strong emotion. Biologically, it is designed to be. It can be used by evil people to influence and control, it is also highly personal - it can also come from unexpected and illogical places. It can also, sometimes steal our happiness. Whether it prevents us from doing something outside our comfort zone, or acts as a roadblock in connecting with others around us based on differences. I think we should all try to recognize when fear is controlling us, this gives us an opportunity to intentionally overcome our fears so that we may be exposed to new experiences and a more fulfilling and hopefully happy life. 

.

 
>The beholders’ eye


>Perceives one reality


>But does not see yours.



Everyone has different perspectives, different realities, and different truths. Each one of us could read through these poems and have different interpretations, and find different meanings. And while life, I feel, is about finding your own meaning, it’s always important to remember that your experience and truth are one of a variety of valid perspectives.


.



**2nd place - /u/HumbleFreedom**

>Sleeping sea lion—


>Tourists test their luck


>For a selfie



This creates such a wonderful swirl of imagery and emotions. I can visualize the tourists and the sea lions in my mind. I can hear the crowd and one way I'm happy - because I get to see the sea lions and enjoy the excitement of the day, the sea air, the water, the smells. I also laugh and see the humor in something we've all seen - tourists doing things that are a bit obnoxious, and I'm slightly annoyed at it. I almost hope they get a little scare from a sea lion. (no one getting hurt of course)


.


>Dark Mojave clouds


>I see the desert I love—


>Like it’s the first time



Experiencing and appreciating little things in life is very important to me. While I try to create space for many of these moments, it’s a rare feeling of experiencing something you love like it’s the first time. It could be a kiss from a loved one, a cup of perfectly steeped tea, seeing a hummingbird on the back patio, or watching a beautiful sunset. Sometimes a quiet excitement fills my cup and I get to experience something like “it’s the first time” You’ve captured this beautifully.

>there is no science for -


>this feeling


>but I know it to be true



I'm an engineer by degree. There are so many things about our sensory experiences we cannot begin to understand through science. Take whiskey for example - they have molecularly recreated aged whiskey in a lab - molecule by molecule, but when they taste it, the flavor is completely different and they don't know why. In an increasingly more technological world, we can measure some aspects of chemistry and physics with incredible accuracy and precision. At the end they are simply datapoints. One lens in which we view the world. While easily influenced and fallible, our senses can pick up on nuances that we simply cannot explain through science. It speaks to the power of our senses and feelings. I think true creativity stems from combining science with our own sensory perceptions and feelings. This is also why I consider it so important to hone my senses. Tea is a way to mindfully taste and sharpen your ability to pick out aromas, textures and flavors. Listening to music on my stereo is an opportunity to listen intently and hear nuances. Exercising is a way to keep the body healthy so you can operate at your best. I think this poem speaks to this and I connected with it deeply.

**1st Honorable Mentions**


It was very difficult to choose only three winners. There are a few haiku that I wanted to highlight as honorable mentions. Each of these users will get 10 additional entries into the random drawing.



>They have come for me

>The witch and her big wolf dog

>She says we’ll drink tea.

>-/u/Skydiving_Sus




I love the fairy tale aspect of this Haiku. It also creates a feeling of tension and suspense - are the witch and her big dog friendly? I would accept the invitation - It's either going to be a great time, or I'm getting chopped up and put into a witch's cauldron. Either way. we're making tea.


.



>A stone is all the wiser
>
>In the garden of the poet
>
>Centered as himself
>
>-/u/mimedm




I feel a lovely sense of wisdom and calm from this haiku. A poet sees the rock for more than it is. The quiet wisdom of the stone in nature, it exists only as it needs to be. By sharing this experience, the poet also brings you into the space and into the calming nature of the present moment. I'd like to spend some time in this garden, that I would.



.


>You left me
>
>Or did you escape?
>
>Broken heart
>
>-/u/Dazy_Hazelnuts_5894



This hit me deep. We all have hurt in our hearts and picking up the pieces is never easy. It reminds me of the times when I was wildly confused and betrayed by a loved one. Sometimes your entire world is upside down and you don’t know which way to go. To those of you who can relate - This too shall pass.



.



>A silver crescent:
>
>moss, moonlight, sweet company.
>
>You, a distant bell.
>
>/u/porchwnc



Some people who make it into our hearts never deserved to be there. It's a satisfying feeling having healed and moved on from something like that. While /u/Dazy_Hazelnuts_5894 reminds me of the sad and difficult times, this poem captures when you’ve moved on and can think about the past with a bit of distance and perspective. For those of you not here yet, keep on moving forward. To those of you here already. enjoy the moment and space you've created.


.



>Dynasties long passed
>
>Sip silently from jade cups
>
>I drink to their ghosts
>
>-/u/BerettaValentine



I love the reference to jade cups, it’s a beautiful and haunting material - definitely ""ghost like"". I will never steep in jade again without thinking about summoning ancient tea ghosts. They will silently linger around me as I steep, keeping me and my teapets company. 


.


>When will the war end
>
>Viciously American
>
>A red and blue yarn
>
>/u/wolfelena724



So much unnecessary pain and suffering in the world caused by the decisions of a few evil people. I feel the weight of it. Thank you for writing this. It's serious, and heavy, and real. America is not the place I was told it was as a child. While I'm grateful for my life here, I am not proud to be an American right now.


.



>The pace is so fast
>
>I guard these stolen moments
>
>of contemplation
>
>-/u/00johnqpublic00


I think we all can relate to time flying by. With so much to do, many times it's exhausting - the pace of it all. Moments of contemplation are so often stolen by work, necessary errands. Guard these precious moments of peaceful contemplation, protect them at all costs.


.


>Terrifying dream
>
>Still in the back of my eyes,
>
>casting a shadow
>
>/u/AlmondFlourBoy



This was haunting and I love it! We've all had a nightmare that stays with us throughout the day. It almost lingers and follows you throughout the day, like a shadow. Welcome it by your side, and it will haunt you no longer, but rather keep you company.


.


>Birds sing at daybreak.
>
>They do not fret about the
>
>coming of nightfall.
>
>-/u/Happy_Carrot_9920


There are always things in life looming on the horizon - a task, a responsibility, something you need to do but don't want to. And of course, the inevitability of death. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't wake up every morning singing. Do not fret about the coming of nightfall, let your spirit shine.

* I have 2 YoE (mostly in internships). Some posts specify not to include internships in YoE, so based on that I'm looking for New Grad/Junior Software Engineering roles.
* Ideally, I'd like to work for an AI, quant, biotech, or post series B/C startup. (I know this is pretty broad).
* I am open to any type of software engineering role (e.g., fullstack/backend/frontend/mobile, desktop apps, embedded, QA, etc.), but most of my experience is fullstack.
* The most important feature in a job I'm looking for is experience working with other strong engineers.

**Where are you located and what locations are you applying to jobs in?**

* Located in Western Canada; ideally looking for US role.
* Willing to relocate.
* Canadian citizen. No US work authorization.

**Tell us about your background and current employment situation.**

* Currently I run my own software consultancy with two clients. I like the flexibility, but I'm looking for a job where I can learn from more senior engineers.

**Tell us why you're seeking help. (i.e., just fine-tuning, not getting called back for interviews, etc.)**

* Seeking any specific (e.g., ""You're missing a period at the end of the third bullet point."") or general feedback (e.g., ""In general, keep your bullet point descriptions less than two lines).

**Is there a particular section on your resume you’d like feedback on?**

* I usually customize the ""Technical Skills"" section to match the descriptions requirements. For example, if the posting requires Python experience, I keep that in the section, but if it doesn't require R experience, I remove that and just leave it in the bullet points. Should I just leave all my technical experience in that section (see snippet) or is it too crowded?
* Is there any advice on my job application process?
   * I'm currently doing 1 hr of leetcode, 1 hr of system design, and 30 mins of messaging people on LinkedIn to coffee chat and get referrals (about a 20% reply rate) per weekday.
   * I use [Simplify](https://simplify.jobs/tracker) to track applications and automate applying.
   * I use [Jobscan](https://app.jobscan.co/) to review my resume.
   * I keep a ""-main"" resume in a folder, create a custom one for each job from that main resume (e.g., change the [resume headline](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/resume-headline/) with the job title of the position I'm applying for, summary, technical skills section) named ""\[number\]-\[company\]"" (e.g., ""100-google"").
   * I have a list of top 10 companies I would want to work for. I message people on LinkedIn, ask for a chat, at the end of the chat ask if they'd be willing to refer me for a specific position, and then apply. I apply to companies outside my top 10 without a referral.
* I try to keep all my work experience on the first two pages and assume people don't read past that. Is it bad to have three page resume?
* Are my bullet points descriptive enough?
* What do you think of writing a description after the company? e.g., ""*\[Bank\] — largest bank in \[Country\] by market capitalization.""*
* Do I have a chance of getting a job at an AI, quant, biotech, or post series B/C startup in the US?

Thanks so much for taking the time to review resume and read this! :)

I love reading other people’s trip and watching vlogs on YouTube so I figure I can share my awesome 2 night spring break stay with my 6 and almost 3 year old. I want to show how much fun you can have without going to the parks! 

We recently let our annual passes expire because my youngest is turning 3 and I didn’t want to have different expiration dates and also, with all the construction going on, I don’t see going to the parks as worth it for the next couple years. Also, we visited several times this past year so we decided to give it a break.
However, I still love Disney and the resorts and I’m always down for a quick getaway. 
I found a 1 night confirmed reservation at the Polynesian for $300 through a Facebook group for DVC rental points that coincided with my daughter’s spring break, so we decided to go for it and do a 2 night split stay with Caribbean beach (got a 5th sleeper room for just under $300 with the FL resident discount) to enjoy the water park on our second day check in.

We live 3 hours away. 

First day: arrive at Caribbean beach resort around 12:30, had lunch at the quick service (delicious and super quick), then walked to the playground where my kids had a blast playing then changed into our bathing suits and went in the pool. The main pool is super nice, but a bit small for such a large resort. The kids loved the splash pad and overall it was a great time. Our room was ready around 1:30. We were assigned a room at the Aruba section which is right next to the Riviera. I originally wanted Trinidad for the Under the sea theming for the 5th sleepers, but I am so glad we got Aruba! The room was spacious and convenient.
We took a break around 4 and watched some TV (watching Bluey at the Disney hotel is part of the experience) and then got ready for dinner. We took the skyliner from the Riviera (an experience in itself and probably my kids favorite Disney ride 😆) to Art of Animation and walked around the cars section because my 2 year old is a cars fan! We had dinner at their quick service (bad; slow service and crowded, you can feel this is a value resort when compared to moderate and deluxe tbh). But we just wanted something quick. Then when we were walking out; they were showing their movie under the stars and it was Lilo and Stitch (my daughter’s favorite movie). We watched for about 30-45 mins and then decided to head back to the hotel around 9 and we caught the tail end of the Epcot fireworks from the skyliner. So awesome! 

Day 2: we woke up around 7:30 and quickly got ready and walked to the Riviera quick service (Primo Piatto) for breakfast. It was delicious! Their lemon blueberry pancakes are amazing! Totally recommend for an in between quick service and table service breakfast! We walked back to our resort, packed up and put on our bathing suits and head over to Blizzard beach. We arrived right at 10 am and it was empty. We grabbed a great spot by Tikes Peak and my kids had a blast there. We went around the lazy river (which is amazing) and then took the lift up to team boat springs and it was the best! Then spent some time at sky patrol training camp. My daughter loved it. 
We grabbed a Mickey pretzel and decided to leave around 1:30 because it was getting very crowded (most people arrive around that time since it is free on check in day). We drove to the Poly and even though our room wasn’t ready we had lunch at Captain cooks (delicious) and grabbed a dole whip and just relaxed. Our room was ready around 4:00 pm and we immediately got in and took a nap. 
Around 7:00, my daughter and I walked to Wailulu Grill to put our names on the walk up list because it was showing on the app it was over 60 mins. When I got there it actually said they were no longer seating people but I was able to put my name on the list and the wait was 90 mins.
In the meantime, my daughter played on the Moana splash pad (it’s the kind of splash pad you don’t need to have a bathing suit for, she just went in between the water) and literally played for like an hour. Our table was actually ready at 8 and they sat us inside on a table that had direct view of the castle. At 8:30 the fireworks started and they pipe the music. It was amazing! We were even able to see tinker bell fly. I totally recommend timing your visit around fireworks.
The food was absolutely delicious. We had the sweet potato hummus, poke bowl and loco moco and the kids had chicken and burgers, delicious! 
Then since we took such late naps, we decided to go around the monorail because ny kids love it lol.

Day 3: woke up around 7:30, walked to Ohana’s (had a reservation at 7:45 and we got there around 8:20 and they sat us right away). We got an amazing  view! Right over the splash pad overlooking the castle.
My kids liked the waffles and sausage. The food is ok. Nothing special. And service was bad, we kept waiting for our coffee. But the characters make up for it and we couldn’t pass out the opportunity of having breakfast with Lilo and stitch while staying at the poly. 
We then went back to the room, got into our bathing suits and packed everything and loaded up the car. Then we went to the pool and the splash pad. Then my kids were hungry and cold (it was windy and my kiddos ate Floridians) so we took a shower by the bathrooms at the pool and changed and I grabbed the noodles and burger from captain cooks for my kids and went to Wailulu again. We were seated outside again with beautiful views of the castle and had the shishito peppers and  wayfinder burger (omg amazing) and the chocolate cake (yummy!). 
After that, it was around 2, my kids played in the sand for a bit and then we made our way to the car. 
We came home with full hearts! It was truly an awesome time!
Just want to share how Disney is so much more than the parks and there is just so much it has to offer when compared to other resorts. It is truly a magical place all around!

I typically suggest we call it a day unless they suggest drinks. There are multiple wine places, two breweries, and one speakeasy within walking distance.

1jnmyji,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1jnmyji/ucsd_philosophy_department/,UCSD Philosophy Department,"The deadline for my paper is approaching, so I decide to write a post in reddit (?). This post is an advertisement for UCSD philosophy department. I know UCSD is well-known for STEM, so those who are humanities major (i.e., philosophy) might not seriously consider UCSD. Here are a couple of reasons why humanity majors, or at least philosophy majors, should consider UCSD as a serious option:

I. Our department is **high in** [**ranking**](https://philosophicalgourmet.com/overall-rankings/): it is the top 20 philosophy programs in this country. Since the cited ranking system is completely based on professors' reputation, the high ranking implies that our department is strong in academics and has many well-known philosophers (i.e., Eric Watkins and Clinton Tolley in Kant, Nancy Cartwright in philosophy of social sciences, David Brink and David Danks in ethics, Christopher Shields in ancient philosophy and philosophy of religion, Craig Callender and Eddy Keming Chen in philosophy of physics, and many others). The department is particularly strong in Kant, philosophy of actions, of physics, and of science. The department also has strengths in ethics, philosophy of mind, logic, etc. In short, basically all the major areas in analytic philosophy are covered. Our department also has resources in continental philosophy, albeit rarer.

II. What I said above is actually not nearly as important as **the quality of undergraduate education** \- I am saying so much mostly to remove the ""only good at STEM"" stereotype. But our department offers amazing undergraduate education as well. All the professors are great teachers. Their teaching styles differ, but the classes of most of them are hilarious; and even if this is not the case, at the minimum the professors really care about their students. All the professors are at the same time very approachable. I have emailed five or six different professors for help, who, despite having never heard of my name, were very willing to help and offer to meet and provide advice. Two of them consistently offer advice to me ever since I switched to philosophy major, and both eventually become my mentors in either senior thesis or independent study.

III. Speaking of independent studies, our department offers **many resources to undergrads outside regular undergrad classes**. Students are free to investigate a topic in independent studies, either for research or just to gain more knowledge in a field, as long as the professors are willing to mentor. And professors are much more than willing to mentor. I have done independent studies with three different professors, and will do another two independent studies with two other professors. I have also contacted another two professors for independent studies, who, despite not agreeing to mentor me, offer very legitimate reasons for not doing so. So, even if the topic that you are interested in is not covered by regular undergrad classes, there is still opportunities to investigate it.

IV. We have also have a **philosophy club** where there are weekly discussions, coffee with professors, and other activities. I only went there three times (one weekly discussion and two ""coffee with prof"") so I wouldn't say anything more than this.

V. The **class size** for philosophy classes is very small. I know UCSD is a big public university, but since the essence of philosophy is discussion and since our department is small, the size of most of our upper-division classes is capped at 40. So there are tons of opportunities for close interactions with professors.

....Can't think of others. But regardless, congratulations to those who have been accepted at UCSD! I hope that this information is of some use to those who are deciding between schools. I hope that this is also of some use for those who are considering a philosophy major. Being in this department is one of the best parts of my life. In this department, I gained my best friends and mentors whom I will no doubt have a life-long relationship with. And through the resources here I was able to get into one of the best philosophy programs in this country. I truly hope that everyone will seriously consider UCSD's philosophy department, and I believe you will definitely have a great time there.

Lungs felt better, but these are not better alternatives for vaping or smoking. I threw my two cans away. Lately, I’ve been back into energy drinks and coffee again after not having caffeine for years. The combination of nicotine and caffeine is absolutely terrible. I’ve been feeling like my heart rate spikes randomly. I feel very heavy, lethargic and lazy. Some nights I can’t sleep because I feel my heart beating out of my chest. I nearly couldn’t rely on living without a zimo in my lip. I noticed spicy foods irritate and burn my gums. I love spicy food but it’s getting unbearable. My teeth hurt, feel more sensitive than normal. Some days I feel sick or dizzy. I pop in a pouch any time this one is out. I’m spending like $30 a week on two cans, that’s $120 a month on something that will never end. This addiction is terrible. I’ve been struggling so much for years between vapes and pouches. Occasionally smoked cigarettes once. Just don’t do it. When you feel like your mind is telling you that I’ve had enough of this, listen to it. Your mind breaks through the addiction every once in a while to say “please help me, you need to stop”. Then the nicotine comes back saying “no, you need this. You’re worse off without it”. Just don’t listen to these thoughts. Start chewing gum, mints, eat sunflower seeds. Anything that will keep your mouth occupied. I’d advise staying away from chewing on toothpicks, plastic spoons or something similar. That will ruin your teeth even more than it’s already been through. I’m just venting right now because I’m sick of this addiction spending my money and taking over my life. We can all do this, let’s just stay busy and motivate each other. Let’s get back into the gym, exercise, meditation, anything other than what has been holding us back. We can all overcome this, we will do it! ",3,1743369437.0,QuittingZyn,0,1.0,False
1jnmwak,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jnmwak/medical_gaslighting_is_becoming_genuinely/,Medical gaslighting is becoming genuinely difficult to deal with,"I (F22) am struggling with medical issues in the UK. This started when I got covid I developed a severe chest infection. After this I got 5 chest infections in the span of about 3 months. When I called the doctors about this, they just told me that was normal, and I just needed to get exercise and eat healthier. I became incredibly fragile and unwell over time. I broke my leg and wrist from very minor things. I started getting severe chest pains until the point of vomiting. I called 111 to be told to take some painkillers and I'd be fine. 2 weeks later I collapsed due to the pain I was in. I ended up going to hospital and they confirmed I have costochondritis. going on 3 years later I still have it and am still getting constant infections and I am very unwell and fatigued all the time.

About a year ago I was getting constant migrines to the point they were lasting 5 days, I would do nothing but sleep, I was constanly vomiting and basically felt like a zombie 24/7. Everytime I went to the doctors I was waved off for basically being overdramatic. One doctor even told me I needed to lose weight, stop eating junk food and stop smoking. I have never smoked in my life, I have a very healthy diet I don't even drink coffee, and I am 47kg which is a perfectly normal weight. I have struggled with an ED before which was on my medical file so this felt absolutely awful. I went to the GP I worked at who then confirmed I had severe chronic migraines and you could actually see when I got one due to how swollen and blood shot my eyes would become. And finally got put on medication for it to help so I could actually function.

Recently I got an abnormal full blood count result and an abnormal result for aspergillus, and low vitamin D and Iron. When I went to the doctors about this she went on at me for 10 minutes about pregancy. I am infertile. Which is on the front page of my medical records. I was then once again sent on my way. For backstory on this, I am unreasonably tired all the time, no matter how much sleep I get my eyes are glazed over and blood shot from how tired I feel. I literally can barely function in day to day life because I feel so exhusted and my body aches all over, my hands cramp up when doinf regular things, my legs back and shoulders hurt all the time. I am constantly getting infections or being really unwell and I just want to feel better. I am so terrified there is something seriously wrong with me because of all of this and I am constantly waved off by doctors and it being chalked up to preganacy or my weight. I just needed to rant about this really because honestly I feel really worried and tired of this all. I am not the only one in my life that has these issues or feel this way.

On one side of the track, we’ve got *Clydesdale Christianity*—the thoroughbred tradition of Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox churches. Heavy. Historic. Built to pull centuries of doctrine through the muddiest theological storms.

On the other side, wobbling onto the course with a big snout and bigger claims, is *Tapir Christianity*—aka Mormonism. And instead of joining the race, it declares the whole track broken, all the horses blind, and itself the only real jockey to ever talk to God.

# Obstacle 1: “The Church Failed… Trust Us to Fix It!”

Tapir Christianity begins by declaring a hostile takeover. According to Mormon doctrine, right after the Apostles died, the entire Church collapsed. Not into mild confusion or bureaucratic bloat, but into total, abominable failure. Christ’s teachings? Corrupted. Authority? Gone. Sacraments? Void. Enter: Joseph Smith, 1830. Cue the angel with the golden plates and the celestial reset button.

The problem? This *“Great Apostasy”* never actually happened.

Christianity has its flaws (lots of them), but complete spiritual blackout? That’s a stretch. The early Church Fathers—Ignatius, Clement, Polycarp, Irenaeus—weren’t part of some post-Apostolic clown show. They preserved doctrine, debated heresies, and bled for the gospel. Meanwhile, Jesus himself said the “gates of hell shall not prevail” (Matthew 16:18). Unless He was bluffing (spoiler: He wasn’t), that Church never disappeared.

Declaring Christianity dead and buried so you can launch your own theological start-up? Sounds less like prophecy and more like a spiritual **corporate raid**. (fun fictional story re the first vision - [https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1jbcw1m/black\_mirror\_mormonism\_smiths\_secret\_account\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1jbcw1m/black_mirror_mormonism_smiths_secret_account_of/)

# Obstacle 2: Jesus & Satan… Brothers?

Yeah, Clydesdale Christians, you read that right.

According to Tapir theology, Jesus and Satan are spirit siblings. One got promoted, the other got kicked out of heaven. Critics (and anyone with a Sunday School diploma) rightly call this *cosmic sibling rivalry nonsense*. It’s one toga short of a Greek tragedy, and it reads more like bad fan fiction than faith.

This isn’t a quirky footnote. It's a fundamental rewrite of who Jesus is. Tapir Christianity’s rejection of the Nicene Creed—the cornerstone of Trinitarian doctrine since the 4th century—recasts God as a committee of three separate beings instead of one unified essence.

To Clydesdale Christians, that’s not “restoration.” That’s *theological taxidermy*.

# Obstacle 3: Sacred Ritual or Glorified Pedicure?

Once you’re through rejecting 2,000 years of doctrine, what’s next?

Borrow and invent some rituals?  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormonism\_and\_Freemasonry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormonism_and_Freemasonry)

Tapir Christianity didn’t stop at baptisms.

They built temples.

Introduced endowments.

Sealings and more [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second\_anointing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_anointing)

Death is no escape from their design either due to proxy baptisms for dead people who never asked for them. And yes—a life sentence of mandatory religious underwear uniforms. 'Unpaid volunteer' underwear uniforms, to be more precise.

To most Christians, this reads like someone added three seasons to the New Testament without asking the original writers. Where Jesus taught grace and simplicity, Tapir theology added dress codes, worthiness interviews, and spiritual merit badges.

And let’s talk about *access*. Clydesdale Christianity says, “Come as you are.” Tapir Christianity says, “Come as you are... but only if you’ve tithed, skipped coffee, worn the uniform, and passed your temple worthiness quiz.” (See Proclamation on the Devourer of Widow's Houses - [https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1cw1ftm/proclamation\_on\_the\_devourer\_of\_widows\_houses\_one/](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1cw1ftm/proclamation_on_the_devourer_of_widows_houses_one/) )

It’s not just strange—it’s a works-based treadmill dressed in divine branding.

# The Middle Finger in Disguise

Let’s call it what it is: Tapir Christianity gave mainstream Christianity the finger. Corporate Christian raiding 101.

By claiming divine authority was lost for centuries—and only restored by their guy—they effectively declared billions of believers through history to be spiritually irrelevant. All that devotion, all those sacraments, all that martyrdom? “Nice try,” says the Tapir. “We’ll take it from here.”

It’s not just elitist. It’s ahistorical. And deeply insulting to the actual body of Christ that’s persisted—through persecution, reform, and controversy—without pretending to be the only true Church on Earth headquartered in Salt Lake City.

# Conclusion:

[Many of my critical views of the LDS ideology merged with mainstream Christianity's views of the LDS. Although I was born LDS and left the ideology decades ago and remain agnostic, I enjoy reading Catholic Legal Blogs and Views - many of which are available @ https:\/\/mirrorofjustice.blogs.com\/#footer - or - https:\/\/firstthings.com - Tapir Christianity is truly very different. ](https://preview.redd.it/bgbt7tkm6wre1.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=f13b82954b0389f52ada6d8558fe61124532ac29)

Tapir Christianity isn’t the worst religion ever.

But it might be **Christianity at its worst**—especially when it forgets its own lowly 19th Century American origins, humility, tries rewrites history, and makes itself the hero after a transparent act of corporate raiding.

If The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (aka The Mormons) want to be taken seriously beyond their money and family tree apps, they might want to reconsider their origin story. Maybe swap out the corporate raid for a reform pitch. Maybe honor the faithful witness that came before. And maybe—just maybe—stop pretending Jesus’ Church fell apart the second the ink dried on the Book of Revelation.

Tapir Christians will eventually need to learn that if they are going to run the Christian Kentucky Derby race of ""faith,"" the first century founding philosopher would have them better respect the Clydesdales who cleared the path before them. Until then, no matter how many temples they build or how much money they hoard, they trot tapirs on the Christian Kentucky Derby track.",5,1743369121.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False

My new flatmate moved in last weekend. We're both here on temporary arrangements. I've lived in this flat for nearly 5 yrs but will be moving interstate in 6 months. She's just broken up with her partner & was looking for a temporary place to live for 6 months until she sorts things out. We met through an Aussie flatmate-finding website where I had posted the listing.

Yesterday, her mum came over to our house, which made me a bit uncomfortable. My flatmate grew up about a couple of suburbs away from here, her parents still live there. I'm from a different country. She stayed out overnight on Sat night, and Sun morn I woke up to a msg from her saying she's meeting her mum for coffee at nearby, & asking if her mum could visit the flat.

It honestly made me a little uncomfortable, but I didn't reply immediately, I actually went back to sleep cos I'm also recovering from a sinus infection. A while later, she knocked on my bedroom door & asked in person, & I said yes & also if it was ok if I didn't come out & stayed in my room cos I had just woken up, was still in my pjs, probs smelled of Vicks, not in a state to meet a parent. I think her mum stayed for maybe 10 mins (FYI our flat is really tiny, just a small lounge room, a tiny kitchen, a bathroom & both the bedrooms). I went back to bed and when I woke up again later, I saw another msg from my flatmate apologising for waking me up & saying that her mum needed to use the bathroom.

To be clear, I'm not bothered by the visit or visitors; I've had flatmates friends come over, even stay with us long weekends/ up to a week. I feel this visit from a parent had a very different vibe, like an inspection by an authority person. & the relationship now kind of feels a little unequal, like we're not equals anymore, that she has someone in her corner & if something went wrong between us her mum will be at our home whereas I'm all alone here.

Am I overthinking this? What do you'll make of it? I've never had a flatmate's parents visit, & I've lived with flatmates even in the UK & Europe, but I've mostly lived with people who've moved from other cities/ countries.",1,1743368953.0,roommates,0,1.0,False

So I (m24) met this person (f26) at the Halloween party of a mutual friend this last October. We talked a bunch and I thought we hit it off (despite the fact that it was super loud and I was super tired that night). The day after I asked my friend about her and my friend said she thought I was nice and gave us both each other’s numbers. My friend also told me in advance that she had gotten out of a bad breakup not long before then and not to necessarily expect anything out of the gate, which I didn’t and don’t. 

(Even when I did decide much later I was sure i was romantically interested in her, I knew I would still be perfectly happy to just be friends if was what she wanted, and I told my friend as much)

We texted  a bit but very infrequently as I found out she’s not a very good texter and I would only hear back from her after a week, or after a few weeks, or there were a couple of times where I didn’t hear back from her for over a month or so. This doesn’t bother me because 1, I knew she was busy with school and work, 2 We had only just met at a party and didn’t know each other very well, so she doesn’t owe me her time or a quick response, and 3 I have also had a history of being a really bad texter which i’ve worked on and I’m not going to begrudge someone for something i’ve done myself. Plus, having no expectations of hearing back from her at any point during this period, I took it as a good sign that she always eventually responded to whatever the last text I sent was, even after a month and a half. Eventually I asked her to get coffee, which we eventually did and had a good time, and she told me she’d like to hang out again at some point. A little while later I asked her to go to a movie, and we did. Coincidentally, that same night she had planned to go out with our mutual friends, and invited me to join them so we could have more time to talk, and we had what I thought was a great time that night.  (It was around this time I decided for sure i liked her romantically) I had wanted that night to tell her I liked her/ would like to taker her out on a date if she was interested, but didn’t think of it before we met with our friends and then were with them the rest of the night and I didn’t have a good quiet moment alone to do this before we both left. She texted me that she had a good time, and the next day I asked her if she was interested in doing another thing soon (she told me she loved arcades so i suggested that) she said good but she was busy for the next couple weeks, so how about the weekend after. So that weekend comes and I hadn’t heard from her so I text her to check in. Nothing, and I don’t hear from her again for about a month. last weekend my mutual friend told me that she had some stuff going on and went back home for a few weeks, and that that might correlate with me not hearing from her. I completely understand because i’ve been through similar stuff, and again I’m not bothered by her not texting me because I’ve been there and also im apatient person and don’t have many expectations of people. Last monday she finally texted me back and asked if i would want to do something in a couple weeks (next weekend now) and I said yes and haven’t heard from her since I responded.

Now we’re at the meat and potatoes. I’m wondering if, given the context of her breakup (before i met her), her personal stuff and very busy schedule, if ai’m being insensitive by wanting to ask her out and i’m wondering if I would be putting too much undue stress on her by even putting the question to her. I’m by no means a pressuring kind of person and would do everything in my power to make sure she doesn’t feel pressured or uncomfortable in any way. 

I have never really been in a serious relationship or been on dates with someone I met irl and not on dating apps. I have a serious fear of rejection that has prevented me from going for it in past with other people I was interested in, and it’s been a long time since I was felt I was in a place with someone to tell them how I felt, and I’m just super worried about messing it up, making her uncomfortable and/or ruining what could be a perfectly good friendship by going there. So i’m just wondering if I should ask her out/tell her how i feel given the laborious amount of context here provided (assuming she doesn’t bail on me next weekend) and if anyone here has any advice or has been in a similar situation.

i struggle with keeping up with eating and remembering to eat. 

it’s mostly because i don’t really ‘understand’ how people keep up with it. going to the shop feels like the worst thing ever also. 

but how do people do it? do you wait until ur fridge is empty then do a full shop? bc i’ve tried that and then i end up hating all the things ive bought or they end up rotting before i get to them.

i also live with my mum and her boyfriend so the view of the fridge makes me so confused. especially when things get moved around etc. it just throws me complete off 

my day usually goes:

wake up - realise i forgot to buy anything for breakfast 

leave for uni, have a redbull and a cig 

get to uni (late ofc) 

*it’s now around 12/1pm*

then i get a coffee from the cafe 

then i go to the library

* i know i could go out and get food but if i did that, id be out of focus mode and my day studying wise would be ruined *

i leave the library around 5pm

get home exhausted, forget that i didn’t get any groceries for dinner either 

then i end up ordering burger king or some shit 

wake up next day, repeat????!!!

am i just stupid asf or is this an ADHD thing?? ",2,1743368782.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

1jnmmwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/comments/1jnmmwe/harmless_april_fools_prank_ideas/,Harmless April fools prank ideas,"Asking here for some culturally contextual prank ideas as well as regular prank ideas. 

I live with my husband, and tomorrow is April Fools day. I've never pranked him before, but I kind of want to this year. I usually suck at controlling my laughter, but will try my absolute best to keep a straight face.

I don't want to play with emotions (eg., lie about pregnancy etc.,) but want some cute, harmless prank ideas, bonus if it's something only an Indian husband would fall for. The good: I'll be going to the office tomorrow so I'll have 8-ish hours away from him to plan for something when i get back. The bad: He'll be at home though, so i can't really set anything up at home. 

I've a really good relationship with my in laws, but we don't live with them. Could rope in my SIL / MIL through call if any pranks that need to involve them. 

Here's what I have so far: 

Wake up early and stick googly eyes on all the things he'd touch while making coffee. 

Wear his clothes (on top of my outfit), and pretend to go to work in them, and pretend not to understand why that's weird. This *might* not work, as I've worn his hoodies to work before and he found it cute how extremely oversized it looked on me.

Call him by his name, constantly. I never address him by his name, only nicknames. He really hates his name. 


That's all I have. And I know they're kind of lame. I've never really been a proper prankster (aside from feeding people chilli powder inside chocolate when i was in school).

1jnm84j,https://www.reddit.com/r/atrioc/comments/1jnm84j/i_came_up_with_a_new_coffee_cow_joke/,I came up with a new Coffee Cow Joke,"Hey Coffee Cow fans,

You probably know the famous inside joke in the Coffee Cow community that Coffee Cow has ""glizzy hands"", supposedly stating that his fingers are made of hot dog wieners. This, of course, is the pinnacle of comedy, and will be the magnum opus of humanity throughout its entire history on this planet. However, I would like you all to consider a new joke to make about Coffee Cow. Perchance.

Here is my idea for a joke: Coffee Cow’s real name is “Atrioc”. The joke here is that it's saying that Coffee Cow’s real name is not “Coffee Cow”, but is in fact, “Atrioc”. 

Now, I don't know Coffee Cow’s actual opinions about The Atriarchy, but nevertheless, it could be funny to bring it up on stream. We can consider two outcomes of this joke:

1. Coffee Cow is not a fan of the ""Atrioc"" joke

If Coffee Cow does not like the joke, he will tell chat statements such as ""no chat my name is not Atrioc"" and ""what does that joke even mean?"". By telling his chat that he doesn't like the joke, the chat will not follow his directions and keep repeating the ""Atrioc"" joke to annoy him, generating more content.

2. Coffee Cow is a fan of the ""Atrioc"" joke

If Coffee Cow does like the joke, he will play into the bit, repeatedly calling himself “Atrioc"". Chat will also play into the bit, such as like they did with ""the smoothie king"".

I believe this joke has a lot of potential. Think of the things we could have by using this joke. We can have an ""Atrioc"" emote, leeches can use this joke in their videos, and Ludwig has a new thing to call Coffee Cow now! The #1 thing that we should do is repeat this joke nonstop for 1.5 years. I think doing that will be extremely beneficial to the Coffee Cow community. Perchance.

I hope you all consider this, and decide what's best for all of us.",0,1743367686.0,atrioc,0,0.5,False

**Background:** I (25nb) am a semi-experienced (\~1+ year) poly person with an NP (25nb) that I've been dating for 1.5 years. NP and I agreed to be poly from the beginning but focused on our relationship and doing the work to be poly in the beginning since both of us had always been interested in poly but had never previously been in a relationship that practiced poly. 

Needless to say, I'm not super new, but I definitely still feel inexperienced over all and I'm not sure what to make of the situation at hand. 

**For context:** Earlier this month, my fellow poly friend Cypress (26f) expressed interest in getting to know me romantically. I've known this friend for over ten years, just FYI. After a few discussions about what we both are looking for and what expectations we had, we mutually agreed to move forward slowly and with the understanding that it would be a more casual, secondary dynamic. 

She is much newer to poly than I am, so I took the lead when it came to asking questions about boundaries, quality time expectations, intimacy expectations, scheduling, check-ins, etc. What I gathered from her responses was that she is interested in eventually having a serious partner and moving toward a less hierarchical structure within that, but that for the time being, she just wants to explore being poly without serious relationship commitments to anyone else outside of her NP (26m). I also understood that her main motivation behind being poly is that she and her NP  have very different needs surrounding intimacy and want to use poly as a means of meeting the needs that are currently unmet in their dynamic. 

All of that was good and well with me, except for her motivation being a red flag for me personally. It was giving using poly as a solution to a problem, which almost never goes over well. I voiced that concern to her during our discussions, to which she reassured me that she doesn't want to use other people to fill a gap in her ""real"" relationship. So, I stupidly proceeded forward anyway. 

Shocker: it indeed did not go over well. 

A few days after agreeing to explore a romantic connection, I asked her to hangout with me. It was not a date. However, it was still intentional quality time that I intended to use to begin getting to know her romantically. I made this clear by not only verbally telling her, but by offering to pick up coffee & breakfast and bring it to her place so that we could have privacy to start the process of romantically connecting. She has a severe gluten allergy and it was not easy finding a suitable breakfast place that met both our needs and preferences, so I ended up going to two separate places for us. No issue, I was happy to do so as I offered. 

**The issue:** Day of, I woke up mad early to doll myself up and go get our breakfast as we had very limited time to spend together (\~1.5-2 hours). The issue came in when I got to her apartment and realized NP was home. At no point did she make me aware of this before out scheduled meeting time. That is a huge no-no for me, even in my platonic friendships. More on that later. 

While I found this frustrating, it wasn't enough to put me off. NP was clearly trying to give us privacy and was actually very considerate. It was Cypress who was inconsiderate. Multiple times, she kept roping NP into our private conversations whenever he came out of his room. There were a few times where she was also forcing physical affection onto him. Re: they have different intimacy needs; he doesn't enjoy a lot of affection. He was clearly uncomfortable with this, which in turn made me uncomfortable. Further, half of what she talked about had to do with NP or gushing over NP. Not once did she compliment me or try to be affectionate with me (something we both agreed would be okay, even early on). 

Okay, cool. Not the end of the world. I know she's new. I thought I'd discuss it with her later, which is what I did. I told her that in the future she needs to notify me of NP's presence BEFORE I come to the apartment so that I can give informed consent, or decide to change the setting, or decide to reschedule to a time when NP isn't home. I told her this is a boundary of mine and that if she continued to do this, I would no longer be willing to have quality time with her in her apartment. 

She didn't handle this well at all. Her immediate reaction was to accuse me of expecting NP to leave his own home just because I was coming over. I never said that nor wanted it nor expected it. She was also dismissive in saying he was only around for 10mins and that the apartment is also his home. Which was not true, but regardless imo it shouldn't matter because I made plans with Cypress, NOT Cypress AND her NP. I explained to her that I was angry, just that I expect when I make plans with someone, I assume those plans will only involve the two of us unless one of us asks about/notifies the other of the presence of someone else/other people. I ALWAYS notify anyone that comes into my apartment whether my NP and/or our roommate is home or not. I feel like it's basic respect and consideration. 

She again pushed back by asking the rhetorical question ""well, did you tell me that beforehand?"" To which I said no, which is why I'm not upset, I'm just trying to set a boundary and communicate my expectation for the future. I agreed that the situation occurred partially due to miscommunication/misaligned expectations, but that I still have feelings over it and that's okay too. To me, this is a very normal part of the process of a new romantic connection: readjusting as needed. 

She didn't say anything else about the situation after me saying that. In fact, I didn't hear from her for several days. When I heard from her again, it was a text saying she didn't want to continue exploring romance together due to alleged incompatibility. Btw, she complimented herself in this text to me LOL. Anyway, it was a very short text. Not once did she try to actually engage in conflict resolution, constructive discussion, or problem-solving with me. Not once did she acknowledge my emotions about the situation. I was shocked that a seemingly small, normal request was enough for her to drop me like nothing. We hadn't even been exploring our connection for a full week at that point. 

Because of how she handled the discussion, the lack of concern she displayed toward me, and the egotistical way in which she broke things off with me, I notified her that this was also the end of our decade long friendship. I'm not interested in being in a poly dynamic or even a platonic dynamic where my most basic feelings and needs are not considered. 

I felt like what she did was selfish and inconsiderate. I honestly feel like I dodged a bullet because to me it's obvious that this would've turned into a dynamic rife with couple's privilege and bad hinging. AIO for feeling this way and for having had cut her out of my life because of it?

The title was in Vietnamese so maybe the meaning has changed (it was originally Japanese)
Anyways this is all i remember: 
 - The main characters are 2 small elves (both females, abt the size of your palm) (chibi kind of art style)
 - One is a brunette and the other is a redhead, they live together 
- The brunette (puts her hair down) is really good at cooking and is often requested to give a taste test by the local restaurant, she's sweet and caring
 - The redhead (i cant remember but she either has short hair, used to have long lucious red hair OR wears her hair in pigtails) is a talented carpenter (?) And have an adventurous kind of personality, if i remember correctly she was a member of some adventurer's group before parting and met brunette. I remember i mistook her for a boy.
 - one of the episodes was about 'pets' (or some sort)

After experiencing a not-so-great pizza from Blue Pan’s food truck, the owner, Giles L. Flanagin, invited me to one of the restaurants to make up for the bad pizza. I’m really happy I took him up on his offer because the pizza was so delicious! First pictures are the pizza I got. I got the “Mountain Top.” 

I shared it with my guest, and I lowkey regret sharing it because it was so good! 😊. 

The food came out quickly, hot, and it was genuinely just a lovely experience. The employees were really nice; one of them accidentally bumped into my guest and was just so nice about it. (They didn’t know she was my guest; they’re really genuine people.) 

But speaking of genuine people, I want to restate that the guys at the food truck were so nice; they were really awesome. And I’m going to see them again soon! Don’t let my experience deter you from experiencing these wonderful people at the food truck. Great experience overall. 

If you want to support a pizza place with a variety of pizza (Tavern, New York, and of course Detroit) style pizza with staff and owners that care about their customers,  then please come to Blue Pan. 

PS: The Motown dip was delicious!

I’m also gay and live in a small town where there isn’t a lot of social settings to be surrounded by other gay ppl. so there’s not a lot of opportunity for me to meet other people in the area, especially since I don’t really like going out to bars or social settings. I’m more of an introvert. and I’ve tried the dating app situation and I’m not a fan.

recently, I’ve been wanting to get a little bit more comfortable with being a little flirty while I’m at work. I know that sounds bad. lol. I’m mean that I just want some practice and some subtle under the rug, ways of showing interest without it coming across as too forward and something that could get me in trouble at work. 

I work at a coffee shop and I’m also open to funny ways of doing it as well, so either real advice or funny ways that I could go about it let me know lol

I slowly approach the two talking before telling Edith that she can turn off her check stand light and close her register for the day.

“Text me later, would you?” she playfully begs him. Edith walks off to her station.

“Hey you.” I say playfully.

“Hi beautiful, how is your day going? Are you stocking the magazines tomorrow? I’m going to be at IGA in the morning and it would be cool if you were there too.”

I smile and stare at him before answering. He continues grabbing drinks from his cart and shoving them in the small fridge. My stomach is now a butterfly pavilion, and I feel every single flutter that’s housed in there. His hair is more chaotic than it was yesterday, but I really like it. His light blue Pepsi shirt really compliments his hazel eyes and now I’ve completely forgotten what he asked me.

“Yep, gotta love Tuesdays!” I say sarcastically.

“Awesome, I was hoping you would say that.” he says with a smirk.

I’m watching him stock the Pepsi bottles, his hand wrapping around them like he’s holding something else entirely.

And god help me, I *wish* he was.

I slip out of reality.

And then, I’m gone.

I’m headed to his house, seeing where he lives for the first time. I text him that I’m here and he waits for me at the door. As I approach him, he grabs my hip with one hand and pulls me close for a kiss. He’s got cologne on again and I moan a little in his mouth. He bites my lip, and my smile escapes his grasp. I open my eyes and he’s staring at me.

“Come on in.” he says with a smile showing all his perfect teeth.

I step inside, and his living room has a huge bong on the coffee table.

“I just packed it before you got here. Would you like greenies?” He asks, holding the lighter out for me to grab it.

I can’t stop smiling. My cheeks hurt already, and I’ve been here for all but two minutes. I grab the lighter from him and thank him while giggling. I wrap my hand around the neck of it, place my mouth on the mouthpiece and inhale to test the water level. The water begins bubbling with a nice sound.

*It’s perfect.*

I don’t hesitate; I light the bowl. I burn just a small part of the packed greens out of common courtesy and inhale. My lungs fill up and I hold the smoke in, looking at him while holding my breath and blow cookies in his face. His face disappears as the plume of smoke covers him, seconds later, there he is, with a huge smile on his face.

“My cousin just gave me this. It’s Alaskan Thunderfuck.” he boasts.

I cover my mouth with my arm, anticipating a cough, though nothing happens. I hand Trevor the bong and he grabs it. I reach my hand out to give him the lighter, but he holds my hand for a few seconds before snagging it.

I lay back carelessly on his couch and close my eyes. I hear the crackle ganja burning immediately after the ignition of the lighter. The water roaring with several bubbles. It’s complete silence until I hear him exhale and cough ferociously. I open my eyes to investigate him. His eyes are watering from coughing so hard. He glazes at me. I stare back at him, smiling. My cheeks hurt slightly from smiling so much here. There is so much energy in the room, and I’m feeling the intensity of it all.

“Marlene, there’s someone waiting at the service desk.” Edith’s voice cuts like a knife through the movie in my head. Trevor is on his knees still, grabbing bottle after bottle. I stand on my tippy toes to see this alleged customer. A bald man waits patiently.

“I’ll see you tomorrow.” I sigh heavily and storm off to the rescue.

Trevor is still stocking the fridges up front when I hear Sterling’s keys jingle as he’s charging towards my area.

The customer walks away just as Sterling approaches.

“I’m trying to find someone to cover Ravyn’s shift. You might have to hang tight, but just give me a holler, and someone on the floor can come help.” He says, out of breath while adjusting his pants that are too big.

I nod.

“Okay?” He says loudly, like I didn’t hear him.

I shoot him a thumbs up and a forced smile.

“I see Pepsi boy is here.” he mutters, the words sour in his mouth.

“I saw that!” I say cheerfully.

“Where’s Clay? Is he covering for him?”

“I think so. Clay’s still on his honeymoon. He’ll probably be covering him until the end of the week.” I say it firmly.

“Awesome, awesome, awesome!” he snaps, banging his knuckles on the counter.

The phone begins ringing loudly.

“Well, give us a holler!” he grumbles, storming off.

After the second ring, I grab the receiver.

“Thank you for calling your local K-mart, this is Marlene how can I help you!?” I say in one breath, automatic.

“Sterling, please,” a woman says, barely above a whisper.

That voice is eerily familiar.

*Ravyn.*

I should tell her he’s not here. Instead, I say, “one moment please.”

The PA chime sounds, and my voice echoes the store.

“Sterling, line one please. Sterling, line one.”

I stare at the blinking light.

I’m dying to hear their conversation.

My body suddenly weighs twenty pounds more than it did around Trevor.

The red light stops blinking. I press the button to see which phone line he picked up.

*MAIN OFFICE.*

Of course he’s in his office. Ultimate privacy.

I wish I could cut the line.

I wish he caught me and Trevor together, kissing intensely. I wish he saw the way he grabs my hips and stares into my eyes. I wish Trevor could tell him how soft my hands are, and how fragrant my hair smells. I wish he could describe the way I kiss him back, and how the moan I give him slips into his mouth, soft and breathless. I wish he could tell him what I look like underneath him.

My blood is boiling, my head is spinning.

I *know* he’s flirting with her. I know he’s comforting her for bailing on her shift.

I know he knows I’ll cover for her. I always do.

They both know I’m reliable.

Trevor waves his hands before exiting the front doors. “Have a great night, beautiful. I’ll see you bright and early tomorrow!” He disappears through the vestibule.

I'm 33, standing confidently at 6'0"" with a lean but toned build at 180 pounds (I blame the late-night snacks, but trust me, you'll want to thank them later). Born and raised in Maine, the most forested state in the U.S., I've got that rugged, outdoorsy charm paired with a playful hint of mystery.

Why You’ll Be Intrigued: Personality: Imagine a playful blend of dark humor, laid-back vibes, and a dash of Gothic intrigue, just enough edge to keep things exciting. I'm the guy who'll whisper a witty joke during a scary movie, making you laugh and pull closer at the same time. Sarcasm is my love language and life's too short to take too seriously.

Interests: Love comedy and horror flicks? We'll get cozy on the couch, trading playful banter while debating plot twists. Gaming your thing? I'm your perfect teammate (currently dominating Call of Duty on PS5). Not into gaming? Even better, I love exploring new interests and discovering yours sounds enticing.

The Breakfast Bonus: Picture this: you wake up to the smell of pancakes, bacon sizzling, fresh coffee brewing. I've perfected the art of indulgent mornings. Lazy Sundays together, wrapped in sheets and laughter, sound tempting? I'm ready to spoil you.

What Turns Me On: Bold Conversations: Confidence and honesty are irresistibly attractive. Tell me what's on your mind. I promise it'll captivate me. A sharp wit paired with genuine openness will always keep my attention.

Playful Energy: Let's ditch predictable texts for something spicier, voice notes or a flirty video call. Chemistry thrives when we're willing to step outside our comfort zones. Adventure awaits. Are you ready?

Open-Mindedness: I'm drawn to someone who's intriguing because she's uniquely herself. Our differences create sparks and exploring them together sounds deliciously fun.

Essentials to Know: I've got my life together, steady job, responsible yet spontaneous, and I'm attracted to women who know what they want and pursue it passionately. Distance? Not an issue. Chemistry knows no borders and I've proven that long-distance can get exhilaratingly intimate.

Together, let's uncover hidden gems, secret coffee spots, spooky haunts, scenic trails, and make memories that feel just a little bit scandalous.

I substituted out “Survival” in row 4 column 4 for an old square from previous years “Author uses Initials”

Row 1: 

First in series - The House on the Cerulean Sea - This was a very cute and heart warming story about an orphanage for magical children. Typical TJ Klune feel good, queer representation, fun story.

Alternative Title - Mistborn AKA The Final Empire - really fell in love with this story, I’m about to finish the original trilogy sometime in the next few days. Super interesting world building and magic systems. Easily loveable characters as well.

Under the Surface - Whispers Underground - Book 3 of the Peter Grant series. This is a fun series that I highly recommend listening to the audio books. I had some doubts about the first book, almost DNFd due to questionable objectification of women but it gets a lot better. The prose when it comes to dialogue leaves a good bit to be desired (please find a new way to say “he said….i said….he said”) but overall like these books a lot and would like to finish the series.

Criminals - Square of Sevens - A historical fiction where a young card reader (an illegal activity) is trying to find the history of her mother and father and gets caught up in the socialite antics of her mother’s family. Great story and awesome female main character.

Dreams - The Full Moon Coffee Shop - A feel good and short little book with three different but intertwined stories of working people in Japan who are visited by a magical coffee shop ran by cats. Worth a read and can be finished in one sitting.

Row 2:

Entitle Animals - The White Stag - this is a short novella telling the story of Nimrod and his sons. It was interesting, if you have some interest in ancient religions and mythology

Bards - Soul Music - I’ll be real, I was just looking for something with a bard that sounded interesting and wasn’t too long. I’ve wanted to check out disc world so I chose this one. I didn’t love it though. I know that starting with book 14 is NOT a great idea. I will come back to disc world at some point, but for now, this wasn’t for me.

Prologues and Epilogues - Thistlefoot - Loved this book about the descendants of Baba Yaga and their adventure after they inherit her chicken legged hut.

Self Published or Indie Published - Compound Fracture - This was a pretty dark story of old family feuds in a small Appalachian town. Our main character is a trans boy and this definitely has a big role to play with the story but it is not THE focus. 

Romantasy - Howl’s Moving Castle - now hear me out! I know that this is not typically lumped into the Romantasy genre but I’d argue this is absolutely Romantasy, it’s just not borderline smut like what most people consider Romantasy. Great story, the movie was a very close adaptation but I loved some of the parts that were left out. I do recommend giving it a read if you liked the movie.

Row 3:

Dark Academia - A Separate Peace - A WWII era school boy story that has a lot to say about losing innocence when faced with the real world

Multi - POV - Witches of Ash and Ruin - I really liked this story about modern day witches in Ireland. Two witch covens must begrudgingly join forces to survive a group of witch hunters and some other mysterious force. I would love a sequel to this story.

Published in 2024 - Smothermoss - a dark and strange story of two sisters in Appalachia that decide they must figure out what happened to two women who were killed on the trail nearby. There is some supernatural stuff going on but I was really questioning what was real or not.

Character with a disability - this is the story that I was worried I wouldn’t finish in time for the bingo card. I was reading this aloud to my partner and we were just taking a long time. Another dark, supernatural Appalachian story about a family that tends to the bog but everything seems to be falling apart. Again, left me wondering what was real or if there was some unreliable narration. 

Published in the 90s - A Clash of Kings - I finished the ASOIF books last year and thankfully read this book in April last year. What can I say that you already wouldn’t know about this book?

Row 4:

Orcs, Trolls, & Goblins oh my! - The Blacktongue Thief - I enjoyed this story set in a dark fantasy world ravaged by a war with goblins. I preferred Between Two Fires and wanted to actually use that book for survival but I’ve already made my bingo card and don’t want to change it now.

Space opera - could have put any of the original Red Rising trilogy here but Golden Son is so amazing, so I put it here. Loved this trilogy, though the first book almost had me DNF in part 2. So glad I pushed through and finished the trilogy

Author of Color - Parable of the Sower - ugh this was a heavy read, especially in the first 3rd. Eerily close to the real world, which is crazy when you see this book was published over 30 years ago. 

Survival (Subbed for Author that uses Initials) - The Near Witch - not my favorite V. E. Schwab book, I would edit this card to change it to A Darker Shade of Magic but it’s already edited and I’m lazy. The Near Witch is a fine story, just please don’t listen to the audio book, the narrator was not good. On the other hand, Michael Kramer does the Shades of Magic books and he is amazing.

Judge a book by its cover - Murderbot Diaries - Fun, short romps with an autistic coded cyborg just trying to enjoy their favorite serials while protecting the humans around them.

Row 5: 

Set in a small town - All the Pretty Horses - while set in a few small towns, this is a beautiful western novel about a boy who travels to Mexico with his friend to work on a horse ranch and falls in love with the Ranch owner’s daughter. Sad and hopeful at the same time. I’ve never been into westerns but this was a great start.

Five short stories - Records of a Night too Brief - this was a real strange collection of short stories. Idk if I truly understand what was going on but I sure read it.

Eldritch Creatrues - The Stars did Wander Darkling - loved this 80’s coming of age, goonies esque story of some PNW kids who are just trying to enjoy their last summer break together when they have to fight back against an ominous body snatching horror in their town, three weird men, and ultimately an unknowable horror beneath their town.

Reference Material - The Will of the Many - omg omg omg love this book and book two just got announced for November this year. Super interesting world and magic system. I was entranced while reading this book, if you like Red Rising (the first book) then check this out cause it’s everything I like about red rising but better, in my humble opinion. It also has a map in the front and a pronunciation guide in the back of the book.

Book club or read along book - The Aeronauts Windlass - I did not read along or join the book club, rather went off the list to find a book that maybe I already read lol. Read both of the Cinderspires books and really liked them. Reminded me a lot of Treasure Planet and that’s like my favorite kids movie so this was right up my alley. Hope we get the end of the trilogy sometime soon!

This was great, at first, when I found out about the bingo card, I was just happy to participate and to finish a few rows or columns, but as I filled it out, I realized, if I pushed myself, I could finish my very first one. Can’t wait to get next years card and can actually plan out my reads and not rush it in the last two months!",9,1743365863.0,Fantasy,9,0.81,False

1jnlg35,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1jnlg35/delonghi_eletta_vs_magnifica_plus/,De'Longhi: Eletta vs Magnifica Plus?,"Hey there! 

Looking for some help to finalize our decision! 

We are ready to invest in a good machine, budget is not really an issue. Ready to spend the dough for the right machine. I'm located in rural Canada, so will be relying on Amazon, box stores, or direct shipping from website, since we unfortunately don't have a good retailer I could chat with. My only previous experience is with a vintage Saeco Vienna semi-auto machine that bit the dust, but I loved the coffee, and how big the water and spent puck reservoirs were..

I considered the Jura, but the idea of the cleaning tablets that you have to buy is a complete deal breaker, plus I actually read quite a few poor reviews on that machine. 

After perusing this page and reviews online, I've narrowed it down to the De'Longhi Eletta or Magnifica Plus, and I need help to decide which one! The Eletta is $1100 CAD more expensive, which I'm willing to pay if it's really the better machine....

The only main feature I can see that the Eletta has over the Magnifica is the cold foam option which I don't really care about, we drink mostly hot coffee. I don't care about the app either.

What I do care about is having larger water, bean, and puck holder/reservoirs... Plus a machine that's easy to clean and maintain. I'm finding it hard to tell online how much these machines actually hold. We also like to use large yeti travel mugs, so being able to fit that under the dispenser is a bonus, but not necessity.

Still open to other brands, but based on what I've read, these are most likely to work best for us.

# My Bingo Challenge Reads

# First in a Series

**Mike Carey: Lucifer - Devil in the Gateway**

Lucifer is a graphic novel and a spin-off of Neil Gaiman's Sandman Series. It is not actually written by Gaiman but hits a very similar tone. It is also the original to the homonymous TV show, although it is not as soppy.

The Volume collects four comic books with a total of two story arcs.

The series follows the character Lucifer Morningstar (yes, *that* guy), who is painted somewhat different from Christian lore. He is the angel antagonizing heaven and appointed custodian of hell. He is not, however, an inherently evil adversary character - just a bit of an arrogant dick.

The series picks up where Sandman left - Lucifer just closed down hell to run a piano bar in L.A.

Both stories showcase strong supernatural aspects and are mostly concerned with the dark side of human nature and the topic of free will - and subsequently, responsibility and guilt.

There are 11 Volumes (at least in the collection I own), so hard mode.



# Under the Surface

**Matt Dinniman: Dungeon Crawler Carl**

I'm not a gamer, and the term ""Lit RPG"" really doesn't rally appeal to me. But since I've already read ""Digger"" and have otherwise drawn a blank on this bingo square, I gave Carl a try.

And I'm still not a fan of the genre as such - reading the book, I was annoyed by the same things that keep me from gaming: the constant looking out for stats, inventory, achievements, levels, you know, all the jazz. I can see how those things are a necessity, but they do distract me from the story.

And a good story it was, despite the distractions.

Actually, the beginning was a bit awkward. Some alien company has the mining rights to earth, which means extracting all valuable substances and leaving the rest in shambles, killing all life forms in the process - next best thing to a hyperspace bypass, really. Some ethical boundaries decree to give any sapient inhabitants a chance to defend their planet, which - double profit - is realized via a gigantic, dungeon-based, unwinnable game show. So earth is transformed into a great big multi-level dungeon, destroying all surface structures and killing the better part of humanity in the process. The survivors have a choice of playing the lethal game or staying on the razed surface and fending for themselves. Our protagonist, who is out in his undies (not boding well for the type of humor) in freezing temperatures to retrieve Donut, his girlfriend's runaway cat, takes his chances with the warm dungeon.

After a few introductory chapters, Donut (or, as she prefers, ""Princess Donut the Queen Anne Chonk"") achieves sapience as a game reward, and our protagonists, are forced to submit to the game mechanics for survival. Fighting, collecting, leveling up, navigating the dungeon—the works. And maintaining an interesting media presence to attract sponsors, Hunger Games style.

And then the story takes off. Our characters get fleshed out nicely and experience even a bit of growth. We get to explore the wonderful world building of the first two dungeon floors, beautifully satirizing all the right RPG tropes. There is banter; there are puns and inverted tropes and humor in all the right places. Even the underpants ease eventually into a decent running gag. There are politics on all levels. We get to see a multitude of NPCs, ranging from expected to bizarre, some of them with quite complex backstories. And a few fellow players, too. And there is a story that is surprisingly captivating considering it technically jumps mostly from battle to battle. There are lots of battles, too, and it doesn't even get old. And no matter what happens, there is always a perfectly annoying cat.

Goddammit, Donut.

Oh, and since we say goodbye to the surface after just a few pages, it's hard mode, too.



# Dreams

**Neil Gaiman: Sandman - A Game of You**

Hopefully I don't have to introduce Neil Gaiman's Sandman. And I'm not getting into the ethics debate either - the story is the story.

""A Game of You"" is a kind of spin-off inserted into the series after the first main story arc. We follow a previous side character, Barbie. She was introduced into the series along with her husband Ken (Yup, that Barbie) as a superficially perfect but actually deeply flawed couple. By the time of A Game of You, they have finalized divorce, and Barbie returns to her old friend circle in New York to recover.

Barbie takes refuge from her troubles in her unusually vivid dreams. But the world she created in the Dream Lands is under attack by an outside force, the cuckoo. Together with a selection of heroic friends, she sets out to defeat the cuckoo. Then the dreams begin to bleed into her real life, and the real life begins to bleed into her dreams.

It's another typical Gaiman—candy-colored and upbeat and dark and bleak at the same time. And a story line that twists and turns and shakes up villains and heroes beyond recognition.

Not sure if this counts as hard mode. Dreams in the series are never as simple as they seem to be - but within those premises, Barbie's dreams are pretty normal, I guess.

 

# Bards

**Terry Pratchett - Soul Music**

This is my one re-read, because you just can't read the Discworld books often enough.

A young bard called Imp y Celyn (which apparently is Welsh and translates to ""bud of the holly"") sets out into the world to play his music. He meets a few obstacles, as well as a few like-minded musicians to form a band with. They get their first show in a pub. And Imp dies. Or maybe not. Because after, he's still very much en route to fame.

The one left to figure out the whole mess is Susan, granddaughter of Death. She's left in charge after Grams goes on some kind of spiritual vacation. Again.

Of course, it doesn't help that she's a teenager in charge of taking the soul of a cute, young rock star. Or that a whole faculty of wizards is getting involved. Or the fact that this new ""music with rocks in"" seems to take over the world, one humming, foot-tapping individual at a time.

Pratchett is renowned for his story telling, his satire, and his world-building (turtles, anyone?), but what really shines in this story are his wonderful, silly puns. About every band, every song title, and every artist known at the time get their cameo in a little side note. Some are obvious (but no less hilarious); others are hidden so deep it takes a couple of re-reads. But all of them are wonderful.

Hard mode. While the language drifts into rock terminology fast, in the beginning our bard calls himself indeed a bard.

 

# Romantasy

**T.T. Klune: House in the Cerulean Sea**

In the first few chapters we get introduced to a depressingly authoritarian system, mostly represented through the workplace of Linus, our MC. This pertains to the strict hierarchical and fear-driven workplace culture as well as the type of work Linus singed up for - the forced placement of children with magical streaks in residential schools, echoing the plight of indigenous Canadians in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Linus' job is to evaluate placements and living conditions, and while he is working for an overall abusive system, he considers himself a protector of the children.

Nevertheless, he manages to maintain an image of neutrality and impartiality, and subsequently is appointed to evaluate a secret and rather controversial institution, placing the most dangerous charges with an equally controversial caretaker.

The scenery changes. The school is situated on a little island, and with the island he enters paradise. The institution is a home, the caretaker Arthur is nothing short of a father figure, and, despite their personal challenges, the children are thriving under his tuition.

And while Linus is not in a trustworthy position, he quickly wins everyone over due to his caring nature - kids and caretaker alike (hence the Romantasy genre). At this point things are getting almost too sweet, and despite working with adult themes, the story has almost the simplicity of a children's book. To make things a bit more interesting, Arthur is shoved into the mysterious stranger trope, which doesn't really fit in the overall theme of trust and honesty. And the big reveal is a bit anticlimactic, too.

Unfortunately, towards the end of the book, things get rushed and increasingly unrealistic. Our protagonist wins the day by antagonizing upper management (don't try this at home, kids!). He gets away with filching stacks and stacks of files. In a government office of a totalitarian regime, mind you. After just a couple of months of dating, the couple then manages to adopt all the kids, live happily ever after and presumably use the stolen files to rescue lots and lots of other kids without repercussions. And then, as an afterthought, on the last couple of pages, after a book worth of missed chances to develop it properly, we get a lesbian love story ex-machina. Because apparently you need to represent them all, Pokemon style.

To sum it up, we have a story that develops from depressing to (maybe a bit too) sweet to plain weird.

A nice read while it lasts, but it leaves a sour aftertaste.

Hard Mode.

It took me a moment to figure out what Dark Academia actually means. It looks like it has not much to do with education and more with the aesthetic of somber historic buildings.

Which is why Piranesi is often listed under the genre. And indeed, it has buildings galore. Building, that is, singular. For our protagonist, the House is the whole world, to be explored, to be chronicled in his diary, and to provide for him (via the seas that flood the lower halls). There is bird life and fish, weather and tides, and endless rows of statues.

But people are limited in the House, and living people are even rarer. Besides the main character, there is just one.

While our protagonist has an inquisitive mind, he has an almost religious reverence for the House. He is content with his life and never questions his surroundings. Until the arrival of a third person in announced and forces him to question everything.

The story is recounted via the diary. And it rightfully should be boring. There are a lot of descriptions of the halls, the statues, and the protagonist's little quests to catalog everything from statues to tides or to find food and other necessities. But it isn't boring. Because, while the MC perceives his surroundings as normal, the reader does not. This weirdness keeps us on our toes, and it is what makes it so satisfying when finally the puzzle pieces click into place.

No hard mode - there's nothing mundane about the House.

**Malte Hoyer, Hannes Braun: Dämmerland**

That one is an odd duck. In fact, one of two odd ducks (the other being Finsterwacht). You see, I like to visit Renaissance Fairs and similar festivals and enjoy the music associated with those festivals - at least the kind that cunningly hides all the pipes and other drone stuff beneath a nice thick layer of Rock or Metal. And this year, apparently, every musician and their dog decided to participate in some collaborative project linking their music to some story or other.

I doubt either of those two is slated for translation.

Dämmerland is an immersive audiobook with an overall narration, yet distributed voices for dialogue (whatever you call that form of storytelling). There's also a nicely illustrated book, which I do not own.

It's a kid's story, following Fiete, a young boy who has a keepsake from his beloved grandmother (a gold tooth, don't judge!) stolen by a magpie.

He follows the bird into a strange fairytale-style realm that is in the process of self-destruction. He meets friends, foes and strange folks and obviously tries to save the world, because, why not?

Until he finally realizes that the whole adventure hits much closer to home than he could have imagined.

On the surface, Dämmerland is a fun little adventure story with cute and weird characters, a good helping of humor, and a nice sprinkle of heroes journey.

But there are deeper layers—a tragic backstory with sad consequences and thought-provoking metaphors behind some of the weirdness.

And then there's the music. There are 16 songs embedded into the story, mostly written by Hannes Braun and interpreted by nearly everyone with a name in the German Folk rock and Medieval Rock scene. And since most of the songs are tied to a character, more often than not the singers are also involved in reading the dialogue, which is extra fun.

Malte is an old hand with song lyrics, but this is his first foray into prose territory. So, hard mode.

 

# Published in the 1990s

**Diana Wynne Jones: Dark Lord of Derkholm**

It starts weird, stays weird, and while there are some darker themes buried, it's an overall light and fun read.

The setting is a medieval-ish high fantasy world. There is magic, dragons and other magical creatures, sword fights, the works. There is also a shady contract with an off-dimension businessman that renders the world into a theme park for tourist groups.

But it's not all show; there are raids and battles, and people are suffering and dying for real. And they are pissed. So the factions responsible for preparing the new tourist season are planning on resistance. Part of the hidden rebellion is - as advised by the oracle - the choice of this year's Dark Lord.

On the surface, Derk ticks a lot of the boxes. He's a magician, living secluded and spending his time magically bending life itself to his will, creating all kinds of chimera in the process.

But his creations are not minions. Depending on their level of sapience, they are treated as pets or, in the case of the griffins, children. They are loved and cared for. So, on second glance, Derk is just a family man with a very narrow magical talent who wants to be left alone. Not Dark Lord material at all.

And yet, he is chosen. And that means his family gets roped into the Dark Lord business as well. We see the events unfold through the lens of Derk's teenage son, who, alongside his father and siblings, tries to stay afloat among acts of sabotage, contractual penalties and general misfortunes. Because everyone has an agenda, but no one bothers to let the main players in on the game.

The author did pass in 2011, so soft mode.



# Orcs, Trolls, and Goblins - Oh My!

**Travis Baldree: Legends and Lattes**

Well, it was advertised as a sweet little book with strong found family themes, and it's exactly that. Nothing less, nothing more.

An orc (Bingo!) adventurer decides to retire, and since she got impressed by a certain exotic beverage along her travels, she decides to open a kind of inn dedicated to brewing said beverage - which happens to be coffee. And with a teensy bit of magical help, her future coffee house, even before construction is finished, draws exactly the right crowd. Most of them misfits, with remarkable niche talents, and all of them yearning for a place to belong.

And that's it. People meet, are gentle to each other, and put their talent and energy into building a coffee house. There is some conflict woven into the second half, but that's really just to keep the few readers who are not satisfied with the description of the newest pastry creations of the resident rattling or some shining new espresso machine happy.

There is also a tentative love story between the protagonist and her comrade of the first hour, a misunderstood succubus joining the venture as a server. But that, too, has to stand back for coffee creations, music nights and cinnamon rolls.

So, without conflict and lots of development, what is this book for? Well, that's easy. It's a comfy early morning read, best enjoyed in small increments, curled up with a steaming cup and preferably a cardamom and orange peel-scented pastry.

Nothing more and nothing less.

Hard mode for the orc barista.



# Judge A Book By Its Cover

**Skottie Young/Kyle Strahm: Twig**

I admit it, I'm a sucker for ugly-cute beasts. And thus, once I held the graphic novel ""Twig"" in my hand, I was smitten.

The story is a simple kid's fantasy story: a guy takes over the responsibilities of his deceased father - not resenting them, but not asking for them either. And certainly without being prepared. He's hitting a lot of snags, makes a few friends, and escapes a low-stakes antagonist. When the protagonist finally meets some mythical powers, after gaining confidence throughout his journey, he finds the strength inside himself to set whatever thingamabob in motion to conclude the task. Closely following the script of some shortened hero's journey.

The task, it is revealed, is to place some magical artifact for the actual hero to find and save the world. So the guy we follow is basically the hero behind the hero.

The charm of this graphic novel is not the somewhat foreseeable story; it's the beautifully designed and fleshed-out characters. Our protagonist is a light blue shaggy creature with big front teeth, big claws and a slightly unintelligent stare. But he has a sharp mind and some impressive emotional intelligence, leading him to the right decision (almost) every time. His friend from the start is some snail/slime mold kind of stretchable creature with a sarcastic streak. He's putting his nonexistent fingers in wounds all the time, but is always coming through when it counts. The third companion they meet (and almost kill) on the way is some bonbon-colored baby rhino with a tragic childhood and magical powers. At least for me as an adult, ""Twig"" is a charming found-family story, and I do not regret giving in to the lure of the cover.

Definitely hard mode.

 

# Set in a Small Town

**Ray Bradbury: Green Town - Something Wicked This Way Comes**

It is not an easy read. The story is simple enough and would make for a good YA book. A carnival comes to town in the middle of the night and lures the inhabitants into its attractions. Some are harmless; some are traps that change people forever, turning them into recruits for the carnival. Especially a carousel with the power to change the riders' ages appeals strongly to our protagonists, two boys, close friends, and the aging father of one of them.

The prose is beautiful, haunting and demands attention. In fact, to me, it was extremely hard to read - on a bad day, I had to read some sentences multiple times to grasp the meaning. 

It's probably me; I'm not even a native English speaker, but the fact that the text is riddled with images and similes from the mid-century is not helping.

But if you are willing to push through, you will be rewarded with wonderful pictures of a crisp autumn night, of the dark, mysterious carnival and the rising tension of the coming storm, literal and metaphorically. Hidden in the words are all the deep and muddled feelings of ending childhood, all the worries, all the excitement and confusion. And the sadness of a middle-aged man grieving for his youth. 

Greentown, the location of this story, is fictional, but nevertheless set in our own world. This means: hard mode.

 

# Five SFF Short Stories

**Jim Butcher: Dresden Files - Side Jobs**

Side Jobs is the first short story collection in the Dresden Files Series, spanning in the timeline of the first twelve books.

The stories take place between the novels, and the tone ranges from pure slapstick in Day Off to grief and loss in Aftermath, leaving the protagonists to pick up the shards from the events in Changes.

There are old and new monsters, fun inserts and stories that, while not strictly necessary to understand the novels, nevertheless drive the narrative. Best of all, in two of the stories, we get unusual POV characters, granting us an outside view of Harry (the protagonist and usual POV of the series) for the first time.

My favorite part? A D&D session that breaks apart because the barbarian (played by a wizard) wouldn't stop lecturing the wizard (played by a werewolf) on the mechanics of fireballs.

Hard mode, because you'd need a whole pack of heckhounds to stop me from reading all of it.

 

# Eldritch Creatures

**Walter Moers: Die Insel der Tausend Leuchttürme**

Another German one, but this author usually gets translated.

The book is part of Walter Moers' Zamonia cycle, which is hard to describe. It's part fairytale, part satire, and a big part just having fun with inventing the most bizarre settings and characters possible.

It's an epistolary novel, supposedly translated by Walter Moers and written by Zamonia's greatest writer - Hildegunst von Mythenmetz (Optimus Yarnspinner). Who is a multicentennial Dinosaur, which should give you a first impression of Zamonia.

As a proud hypochondriac, Yarnspinner visits an island-bound health resort for treatment. The island of Eydernorn is loosely modeled after the German coastline and garnished with a lot of weirdness. The main point of interest on Eydernorn are its many lighthouses, which Yarnspinner resolves to visit. Piece by piece, the lighthouse keepers and other locals feed the writer information, but by the time Yarnspinner is finally able to see the full picture, he is already roped into the resistance against a monumental threat, not just against Eydernorn but all of Zamonia.

The adversary? A giant cloud shadowing the island for decades, with limbs and organs, an arsenal of tornadoes parked in its intestines for later use, and an army of cloud spiders as foot soldiers. And, of course, evil intentions geared at world domination. It doesn't get more eldritch than that.

Hard mode: no Cthullhus were harmed in the making of this book.

 

# Reference Materials

**Bernhard Hennen/Torsten Weitze: Die Feuer der Finsterwacht**

So, as promised in the review of Dämmerland, there is another story linked to music. This one is a cooperation between three partners: the medieval metal band ""Saltatio Mortis"". The ""Ulysses Verlag"", a publishing house for table-top role-playing games. The game system in question is called ""Das schwarze Auge"" which is basically D&D's little German cousin.  And the German fantasy writers Bernhard Hennen and Thorsten Weitze.

The story is set in Aventurien, the main location for DSA games, specifically in the North of the continent. This is an area that has been contested between orcs and men for centuries. To protect the population along the border from orc raids, men have erected a row of signal towers as an early warning system. Those towers and their ragtag crew of soldiers are called Finsterwacht. The orcs are stirring again, and the local defenders suspect foul play beyond the usual conflicts. 

Our protagonists, Haldana, a smuggler from the South, and Gramosch, a layed back dwarf lacking the talent for metalwork, get coerced into investigating. As a cover, they travel with a band of bards, touring the towers of Finsterwacht and providing the soldiers with some much-needed relief, while Gramosch and Haldana are searching the basements for suspicious artifacts.

And here it gets interesting: those bards do have their real live counterparts in the band ""Saltatio Mortis"". The songs they perform in the tavern of Aventurien and along the towers of Finsterwacht? Those do actually exist on the corresponding album. There is a third part to the project: two short RPGs featuring the protagonists of the novel and the fronter of the band as playable characters (one of which is also co-written by the hurdy-gurdy guy - things really do interlink).

And that's why I chose this novel for Reference Materials. Never mind the rather useless map and the glossary within the book - there are the role-plays. There is the lore of a whole role-play system. There are mood tracks. And there is a [WHOLE FUCKING SOUNDTRACK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPOzqI57d2s). And a series of concerts. And ... and ... and that's got to be hard mode, right?

 

# Book Club or Readalong Book

**William Goldman: The Princess Bride**

One book that came up multiple times in the older book club lists is The Princess Bride. So I decided to close this educational gap. 

Now, I know It's kind of sacrilegious, but the of storytelling is not for me. Don't get me wrong, I like the general idea of an embedded story, and the idea of an author awkwardly explaining why he is butchering the story and using his novel as a diary substitute while he's at it sounds kind of fun. But the story is still butchered, and the alter ego of the writer is a deeply unpleasant person - both factors that detract from the reading experience. 

What's left of the story tells the tale of a toxic relationship labeled true love, and as much as I usually like satire, I'd much prefer to break the ""true love"" trope with something like constant bickering or unexpected reality checks rather than bullying and death threats.

The text is highly quotable, though.

 

# Books I really wanted to read for the challenge (but didn't)

# Alliterative Title

**Scott Lynch: Gentlemen Bastards - The Lies of Lock Lomora**

After the few pages I read I can say that this book has it all: a good back story, a beautiful world, fun and cocky characters, a good scam in the making - it's the kind of story where usually at some point tragedy strikes hard. That's probably why I DNF'd the book, so I can stay with the fun part. I really nead to grow up one of these days.

#  

# Criminals

**Brandon Sanderson: Mistborn - The Final Empire**

I've been juggling around this one with the Lies of Locke Lomora and Six of Crows.  Three heist books scheduled and none of them read.

 

# Entitled Animals

**Leigh Bardugo: Six of Crows**

Kaz and his crew are my favorite characters from the Shadow and Bone TV series. I was looking forward to reading their actual story.

#  

# Prologues and Epilogues

**Jim Butcher: Cinder Spires - The Aeronaut's Windlass**

I love The Dresden Files, I adore Steampunk. I really need to shoehorn this one into this year's challenge.

 

# Self-Published or Indie Publisher

**ErraticErrata -** [**A practical Guide to Evil**](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/)

**Pirateaba -**  [**The Wandering Inn**](https://wanderinginn.com/)

**Casual Farmer - Beware of Chicken**

I didn't even get around to choosing.

#  

# Multi-POV

**Tad Williams: Osten Ard - The Heart of What Was Lost**

Memory, Sorrow and Thorn were among my favorites back in the day, and am planning to get to The Last King of Osten Ard one of these days.

This novel deals with the aftermath of MST through the lens of three characters on different sides of the conflict and bridges the gap between the two bigger cycles. And while I didn't manage this year, it's still on the menu.

 

# Character with a Disability

**China Miéville: New Crobuzon1 - Perdito Street Station**

Centers around an avian character who had his wings removed - that's certainly a disability.

I read a little bit into the book and the world building is incredibly colourful and gritty at the same time. Promising, maybe this year.

 

# Space Opera

**Ursula K. Le Guin: Hainish Cycle - The Left Hand of Darkness**

I did enjoy Earthsea, but never got around to read Le Guin's SciFi works.

 

# Author of Color

**Ken Liu - Paper Menagerie**

A short story collection. One of the stories, Good Hunting, has a brilliant animated film adaptation in Love, Death and Robots.
