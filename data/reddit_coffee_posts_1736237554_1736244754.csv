1hvoair,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hvoair/worth_it_to_salvage_the_friendship_deciding/,Worth it to salvage the friendship? Deciding between returning her sentimental items and moving on.,"So, I (29M) met this girl (25F) about 3 ½ months ago – we hit it off and hooked up. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I felt a deep connection with her, and she asked me to exchange phone numbers. What was weird is that she trauma-dumped on me during the night we hooked up, telling me how her mom passed away when she was a kid.

The first few times we hung out, she seemed really into me, but she was flaky and always late. She would constantly lie about small things that I didn’t even care about. I called her out on it, and she stopped – except for the lying part. She told me how she didn’t want anything serious, how she hadn’t been in a relationship for six years, and how she only hooks up, etc. So, we agreed on a FWB-type scenario where I emphasized the friendship part. However, after one time, she started distancing herself – never initiating contact but always agreeing to hang out.

 

We started hanging out regularly—at least once a week—for several hours (sometimes 7-8 hours), but it was usually at a bar. Over time, I felt like we were growing closer, and there was a clear sense of romantic tension. She began opening up more; however, by the end of our meetups, she would always reiterate that she didn’t want anything serious. At times, she could be blunt or critical, making comments about me being boring, even though she consistently chose to spend so much time with me. She also insisted on tagging along with my friends when I had other plans, which made things awkward.

Fast forward a bit, and our hangouts turned into 2-3 times a week – after which she would always distance herself even more. She was doing this dance where she would literally invite me to her place, start getting close to me, like putting her legs over me or sitting extremely close to me, and then pull away panicking like she didn’t know what to do. She would make comments like, “We should have a scientific experiment where you blindfold me and we get physical,” but when I got close, she would pull away. This lasted for some time. I suggested that we should start dating – she wouldn’t say no but rather  invite me to her place. At that time, she started lending me some books.

She got sick, so we hadn’t seen each other for a few weeks – but when we met in person, we continued where we left off. We decided to go out drinking one night with my friends. I offered to pick her up, and she accepted but made a big deal out of it because “we are arriving together.” She invited us to her place after that, where she was extremely affectionate, sitting in my lap in front of my friends, touching my legs, etc. She suggested we send them home and that I stay over – so we called them a cab, but immediately after they left, she started pulling back again, saying she didn’t feel like having sex. I told her that I didn’t understand what was going on. We hung out for half an hour more, and I told her I was going to bed. We cuddled and held hands for hours in bed – just chatting, and then she hit me with, “This is wrong, but hand-holding made me horny. Let’s get physical, but if we do, we aren’t allowed to see each other ever again.” I told her no, and she said, “No kissing then,” which I also refused – and then we had the most passionate kiss ever. I left in the morning, and she lent me another book (I had asked about it a long time ago but didn’t even remember anymore – she just gave it to me). It was a personal book, which was her mom’s gift to a friend who later gave it to her. However, there was a lot of stuff underlined in the book, so I asked her who had underlined it – after which she pulled away again.

 

After that, she was extremely distant. She avoided meeting up for three weeks. We finally met up with a friend of mine, and she told me she had been avoiding me because she got into a relationship two weeks ago and it wouldn’t be fair if she were still hanging out with me (but she had no problem sleeping with a married guy before that, and she would even defend him, saying how considerate he was because he didn’t want to divorce because of the kids). I told her I would still like to continue hanging out and that I would respect her choices because, honestly, I really do care about her and wouldn’t want to cut her out of my life. She mentioned multiple times that we wouldn’t hang out one-on-one ever again. After the bar closed, I told her to come to my place so I could give her stuff back (which she had mentioned multiple times how sentimental it was). I was already in the car, and she called me, telling me to come to another bar. She then proceeded to attack me – saying she would never date me, that she was only hanging out with me because she didn’t have anyone else to hang out with, that she only accepted my invitations to hang out because she didn’t want to be rude, and tried gaslighting me that stuff that happened never happened. In all of that, she said something along the lines of, “You haven’t even experienced anything in your life” – which I took to mean I hadn’t traveled a lot or similar. I sarcastically answered, “No, you did,” and then she started crying and told me again how young her mom was when she died. I tried explaining that I didn’t understand her comment in that context. I asked her if she wanted to talk about what happened as well. I have some stuff that I’ve been through (not as heavy, obviously), so I opened up as well, and at that point, we were both crying. She told me she was sorry she ever met me, that she just lost all respect for me, and then blocked me on socials in front of me. She told me she was going to the bathroom, then messaged me a few minutes later saying she had to leave because she was not in the mood to talk anymore and that we would see each other next time. She didn’t even send me a happy new year text (she didn’t block my phone number).

Now – I know this is quite a story; however, I really do care about her and would like to stay in her life as a friend. I have no idea why. I have no idea how to proceed with this. At the very least, I would like to return the stuff she lent me, as she mentioned multiple times how important it is to her. I was thinking of sending her a message asking if she wants to pick her stuff up, if I should mail it to her, or if I should bring it next time when we see each other (if ever). This is hard for me because I feel like I lost the last bit of self-respect I had, especially after she told me she was only hanging out with me because she didn’t have anyone else to hang out with (which seems contradictory – multiple times she left coffee with her friends to hang out with me – unless she was lying). But I don’t want to feel like I’m hurting someone by not returning their sentimental belongings.



**TL;DR**: I (29M) met a girl (25F) 3.5 months ago and developed a complicated FWB relationship. She often sent mixed signals—being affectionate, spending hours with me, and lending me sentimental items—only to pull away, act rude, and remind me she didn’t want anything serious. Recently, she revealed she started dating someone else, avoided me for weeks, and told me she only hung out with me out of politeness. During an argument, she claimed I hadn’t “been through anything in life.” I misunderstood and responded sarcastically, which made her cry and bring up her mom’s death. We both got emotional, and she ultimately blocked me on socials but not on my phone.

I still care about her and want to stay friends, though I don’t know why. At the very least, I want to return the sentimental items she lent me (she’s mentioned how important they are). I was thinking of messaging her to ask if she wants to pick them up, mail them, or wait until we (potentially) see each other again?",1,1736244534.0,relationships,0,1.0,False
1hvo9sd,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hvo9sd/my_guy_friend_21m_asked_me_21f_to_be_his_fck/,My guy friend (21M) asked me (21F) to be his f*ck buddy after he spent a whole day with his girlfriend. ,"I (21F) rarely made any friends in uni due to spending most of my time studying and participating in extracurricular activities to keep up my scholarships. Henry (21M, fake name) is my classmate in uni after we took the same class in 2nd year. We only had occasional greetings, until last year when we got closer after participating in a contest and doing a research paper together. 

Around July, I was still with my ex-bf of 2+ years and Henry was aware of it. He constantly complimented my ex and how good I and my ex looked together. Around August, me and my ex started to fall apart and Henry started to ask me out for coffee so I could rant to him and he could ""give advice from a man's perspective"". Me and my ex broke up soon after in September. From September to December, Henry would often call me up to go grab lunch or dinner whenever we had classes. At this time, he has been with his new gf for around 4 months. To me, it has been very friendly and considerate of him, assuming he was just hearing a friend out since I consolidated and listened to him when he broke up with his ex last year. 

Now, everything shifted during New Year's Eve. I had no plans for NYE so Henry said we could go for a drink and watch the fireworks. I thought it was weird why he didn't spend the NYE with his gf, but he reassured me that he would spend the first day of new year with her since she was in her hometown (2-hour drive away) and couldn't go out late anyway. I was still feeling a bit icky about spending NYE with just the two of us so I made it into a party with my best friends from high school. During the party, he was quieter than normal but nothing out of the ordinary, I assumed he was just shy since there were strangers. I could not hold my liquor so he constantly offered to drink for me whenever my friends insisted. We ubered home together, me, Henry and one of my besties. During the ride home, I was super sleepy from the liquor so he insisted I lean onto him to take a nap. I did, since it is normal for me to do this with all of my other male besties (my group has 4 boys and 3 girls).

Me and Henry did not talk the next day until 8 PM when he suddenly DMed me ""Wanna f\*ck?"". Keep in mind, we usually joke by bickering and quarrelling like siblings, he even once remarked that it was disgusting when a mutual friend asked if we were dating, and I made it very clear that I view him as a bro and I prefer to date girls (I'm bi). So, I thought he sent it to the wrong person so I replied ""wrong person"". Long pause, 10 mins later, he confirmed that he meant it for real. I was super flabbergasted at this point since I never saw this coming so I just said he's drunk and told him to go to sleep. Long pause again, and then he went on a rant about how he was so sorry and that he understood that I might be mad, I reassured him I wasn't mad, and his gf would be the one who's mad. I basically told him I would take this as if he was drunk and mistakenly sent that to me. He then went on and on about how inappropriate it was, that he didn't know what had gotten into him, that he really viewed me as a good friend and how valuable our time together was to him since he felt like he could act like himself around me, etc. He begged for forgiveness and asked if we could remain friends, but honestly, I don't know if I could view him as friends anymore. He has since asked me to coffee and talk things over but I haven't replied.

This is the second time this has happened to me, I am so disappointed to lose another good friend since I don't have that many friends in university. I don't know what to do, tell his girlfriend? Act like nothing happened to keep a friend? Or cut contact with him?",1,1736244440.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

Enter the [2 seater sofa](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/christina-sofa-white)—a small but mighty piece of [modern furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) that combines comfort, practicality, and style. Whether you’re furnishing a cozy apartment, a studio, or an outdoor nook, a [2 seater couch](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/munich-sofa-white) can transform your space in surprising ways.

# Why Choose a 2-Seater Sofa?

A 2-seater sofa is the ultimate solution for small spaces. Its compact size allows it to fit perfectly in tight areas without overwhelming the room. But don’t let its smaller footprint fool you—this versatile piece is designed for maximum comfort and visual impact.

Here’s how a 2-seater couch can elevate your living space:

# 1. Optimize Your Space Without Compromise

In small living rooms, every inch counts. A 2-seater sofa strikes the perfect balance between functionality and style. Unlike larger sofas, it doesn’t dominate the room, leaving enough space for other essential pieces like coffee tables, shelving, or accent chairs.

**Design Tip:** Pair a modern 2-seater couch with sleek, minimalist decor to create an airy, uncluttered look that maximizes your living area.

# 2. Add a Touch of Modern Elegance

Small doesn’t mean boring! A 2-seater sofa can be a stunning focal point in your living room. With its clean lines, bold fabrics, and sleek finishes, it fits seamlessly into any modern furniture design. Choose neutral tones for a timeless look or vibrant colors to make a statement.

**Styling Suggestion:** For a cohesive aesthetic, add accent pillows and throws that complement your overall theme.

# 3. Create a Cozy Outdoor Retreat

Think beyond the indoors! A 2-seater sofa is perfect for creating a relaxing outdoor space. If you're a fan of natural textures, consider [rattan outdoor furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/furniture/rattan), which combines durability with a rustic yet chic vibe. A 2-seater couch made from rattan can transform a balcony, patio, or garden corner into a stylish oasis.

**Outdoor Styling Tip:** Enhance your rattan 2-seater sofa with weather-resistant cushions and pair it with a coffee table or a couple of poufs for a complete look.

# 4. Double Duty: Functionality Meets Versatility

A **2-seater sofa** isn’t just for the living room. Its compact size makes it ideal for multi-functional spaces:

* **Home Office:** Place a 2-seater couch in your home office to create a cozy seating area for breaks or brainstorming sessions.
* **Guest Room Alternative:** In a studio or one-bedroom apartment, a 2-seater sofa with a pull-out bed can serve as a sleeping space for guests.
* **Entryway or Reading Nook:** Use a stylish 2-seater sofa to create a welcoming entryway or a peaceful spot for reading.

# 5. Cost-Effective Without Sacrificing Style

Small furniture often comes with smaller price tags. A 2-seater sofa allows you to invest in quality, stylish pieces without breaking the bank. Many retailers offer affordable options that align with current modern furniture trends.

**Pro Tip:** When shopping for a 2-seater couch, look for durable materials like high-density foam cushions and solid wood or metal frames to ensure long-lasting comfort and quality.

# Why Rattan Outdoor Furniture Complements a 2-Seater Sofa

Rattan furniture, with its natural charm and timeless appeal, makes a great companion to a 2-seater couch, especially for outdoor settings. Lightweight yet sturdy, rattan pieces add texture and warmth to your space. Pair a rattan outdoor furniture set with a compact 2-seater sofa to create a harmonious blend of comfort and style for al fresco lounging.

# Final Thoughts

A 2-seater sofa is more than just a space-saving solution—it’s a versatile, stylish, and transformative piece of modern furniture that can elevate any small living area. Whether you’re curating an indoor retreat or designing an outdoor lounge with rattan outdoor furniture, the right 2-seater couch can redefine your home’s functionality and aesthetic.

1hvo6ko,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Fernmania/comments/1hvo6ko/the_school_gates/,The School Gates,"I have a quality that draws narcissists towards me. I am a completely and transparently a people pleaser. I am like an injured gazelle on the Serengeti – easy prey. I will drop everything to do someone a favor, just because it may make them like me. My whole life can be in chaos, I will be drowning in tasks and laundry and waking up in a cold sweat every morning completely overwhelmed but ask me to have your children and feed them dinner whilst you go for drinks with the girls, I will not hesitate to say yes. Most people, I have discovered are decent, and whilst spotting this quality will make every effort not to take advantage and if I do help them offer praise involving the words ‘nice’ and ‘kind’. Narcissists, however spot me a hundred yards away, in this case across a school playground, and firmly lock me in their sights. 

I moved my daughter to a new school after moving house when she was six and in year one. My other children were still at home – my first son being one and my youngest six weeks old. I had just survived parenting, giving birth and moving house during Covid. I had extreme post-natal anxiety and was experiencing a sense of loneliness. All my friends were further away than a reasonable car ride. I was vulnerable and tired, a prime candidate for the narcissistic hyenas to start circling. 

The school is a lovely and pleasant village school, all smiles and good mornings and how was you weekend? I had a few coffees with well-meaning but busy mums, trying to make me feel welcome. I was however still feeling lonely and isolated at being on my own with young children. Then came the moment of acceptance that I had been waiting for. A mum called Sarah who I had spoken to a handful of times came striding over ‘‘would your daughter Florence like a play date with Ella?’’  

‘’yes, yes of course’’ I stumbled. A play date at someone else's house. Coffee maybe? Maybe it would lead to wine and girls' nights out and mornings spent gossiping in cafes over cappuccinos and brunch. ‘’Excellent are you free next Wednesday?’’ 

‘’yes yes of course’’ 

‘’Cool, I will let the school know that you are picking Ella up. Are you ok to feed her dinner? I am in London meeting a client. Back around 7:30pm at the latest. I will text you up when I am off the train’’ 

Sarah’s phone rang and she answered ‘’well hellooooo’’ she cooed at whoever was at the other end and she swaggered back towards her Volvo unlocking it theatrically, her body language and tone as if she was flirting heavily with her client, like they were on a first date. I stood with my youngest strapped to my chest crying for a feed, my second on the precipice of an epic tantrum, me sweating from the effort of dragging them the eight minute walk to the school gates.

However, things changed after that. She started ghosting me and replying coldly to my messages. I was really confused, wondering what had gone wrong since everything had been fine before. One thing I should mention is that I was always the one texting her first and initiating plans. Her sudden distance started to trigger my ego, so I pulled back from her.

So I (27M) met Mila (25F) like 4 years ago at a bar. Long story short, it was a mutual friend’s birthday, we were at this bar, and we had both just gotten out of long-term relationships. Hers was 5 years, mine was 4. A LOT of drinking later, it was hella awkward waking up naked on the birthday dude's couch with Mila. But honestly, that wasn’t even the wildest thing that happened that night. The birthday guy? He did something WAY worse.

Anyway, after all that, me and Mila were both super awkward about it. She legit looked like she wanted to crawl under a rock. Neither of us wanted anything serious since we had just broken up with our exes, but we still swapped numbers and went our separate ways.

Fast forward like 3 months, Mila texted me up asking to grab coffee. I thought it was kinda weird, but I figured she might wanna go on a date or something. When I got there, she looked like she’d been crying. As soon as I sat down, she just started bawling. Turns out, she was pregnant. She hadn’t realized cause she was super stressed and tired, but I was the only person she’d slept with. My whole life flipped upside down. We did a DNA test, and it was mine. Then she moved in with me cause she was sharing a room with a roommate. The guest room became hers, and my office is now Andreas room, but we call him Andy.

Having a kid wasn’t exactly in my plans, but since Andy came along, my life’s been better, honestly. Over the years, me and Mila never really had a romantic relationship, except for this one time she kissed me after Andy was born. We get along, I support them, I’m paying for Mila’s grad school (she finishes next year), we split the chores, and I’m always there for whatever she needs.

So, in November, Andy’s gonna turn 3. We’ve been planning his birthday, it's around Halloween, so he and his friends are all gonna dress up. He wants to go as Bingo from Bluey. During one of our talks, Mila asked if I wanted her to move out. She said now that Andy’s 3, we could co-parent separately, and I could even, like, get a girlfriend if I wanted to. I just went blank and said “no” and dipped to my room.

Here’s the thing: I love her. Having Andy is everything to me, but I’m also legit in love with her. She’s smart, beautiful, caring, thoughtful, kind, dedicated, she’s literally the most perfect person ever. But I’m way too scared to tell her. We have a kid together, and I’m terrified of ruining everything between us as parents and friends. I don’t know if I should tell her how I feel or just keep pretending everything’s fine so I don’t mess up what we have.

**What did the birthday boy do?:**

I hope this doesn't violate any rules in this sub, I didn't comment on the OG post, but I snooped in his comments to see what the heck the birthday boy did. I found out

>""Man, the real question should be: what didnt he do on his birthday? We hit up this bar, and everyone got totally wasted, then there was an after-party at his place. We walked there, and I was up front with Mila and some other friends. After that, all I know is from the stories cause I spend the night with Mila, but apparently, he got home barefoot with some random dog he stole from someone’s house (?). He decided to get back at his girlfriend for cheating on him, told everyone about it, and then hooked up with her sister while his girlfriend cried outside the room. He ran around the neighborhood in his boxers and ended up passing out on the lawn hugging the stolen dog.

[I FINALLY TALKED TO HER ABOUT MY FELLINGS!](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1g21z2z/i_finally_talked_to_her_about_my_fellings/) \- 12 October 2024

So, I (27M) posted my story a few days ago, and yesterday I finally talked to Mila (25F).

Quick recap: me and Mila had a baby together after a one-night thing. Ever since, we’ve been living together and I’m in love with her. She’s absolutely stunning, breathtaking even, but I’ve been too scared to tell her how I feel because I didn’t want to mess up our co-parenting situation.

So, I left work early, picked up Andy from nursery, and dropped him off at my mom’s. I bought some flowers, cleaned up the house while she was in class, and texted her, saying she didn’t need to pick up Andy and to just come home because we needed to talk.

When she got home, she looked at me with her big eyes wide open, and the first thing she asked about was our kid. I hugged her for a while, but she went full mommy bear mode and kept asking about our baby boy. After I reassured her that he was with my mom and totally fine, she finally calmed down. I brought her to the living room, gave her the bouquet, and started talking.

It was a long convo. I told her how I’ve been scared of ruining things and how it hurt when she asked if I wanted her to leave. She admitted she was afraid she was messing up my life, that she feels like a burden sometimes, and even blames herself for ""ruining"" my life with the pregnancy. I shut that down real quick. I never wanted kids, but honestly, since Andy and Mila came into my life, everything’s been way better. It’s been the best, most challenging “mistake” I’ve ever made.

She also said she likes me too, and she’s felt that way since she was pregnant but wasn’t sure if it was just the hormones. After the baby, she felt embarrassed to say anything because she didn’t feel comfortable in her body anymore. She never got back to her pre-pregnancy body and thought I wouldn’t find her attractive. But to me, she’s the most beautiful and hot woman on the planet. She also admitted she’d get jealous when I went on dates, even though she knew it didn’t make sense because we weren’t ""a thing."" Honestly, if she went on dates, I’d be dying of jealousy too.

We talked for a long time, even got into some deeper, more personal stuff.

By the time we were done, it was late. We went to this small restaurant near our place for dinner. No wine 'cause I was driving, but it was amazing. We chatted about music, movies, and she went off about ASOIAF for ages while I rambled on about LOTR. We talked about life and random stuff. At the end of the night, I got a few kisses in the car, like we didn’t even live together, which was kinda cute.

Then we watched a horror movie(awful movie btw), but she fell asleep cuddling me. It was a day full of wins.

[\[NEW UPDATE\] I FINALLY TALKED TO HER ABOUT MY FEELINGS!](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hiulln/update_i_finally_talked_to_her_about_my_feelings/) 20 Dec 2024

Hey guys!

So, I saw a TikTok video about my story and it’s kinda embarrassing having a piece of my life narrated by AI haha. I decided to give y’all an update, but first, a quick note: please use protection. I read some concerning comments about my situation. Yeah, I was pretty drunk and reckless, and things could’ve turned out way worse. Don’t be like me.

Alright, here’s what’s been going on these past few months: We broke up, and she moved to another city :( … Just kidding, haha.

Andy’s birthday was amazing! Everyone showed up in costumes, and the kids loved it. Andy dressed as Bingo, I went as Bandit, and Mila was Chilli. Andy was over the moon that we all dressed up, but what melted my heart was when we were getting ready in the bedroom, and my little guy said, “I always wanted this.” I think the way our dynamic was before, we didn’t really have these sweet family moments, and it makes me so happy that my son gets to experience this now.

So yeah, we’re officially dating now, and it’s been nothing short of amazing. She’s happy, my little guy is happy, and nothing makes me happier than seeing them like this. Has it been perfect? Nah, it’s the start of a relationship with a lot of baggage. We’re doing couples therapy because we’ve been living together and acting as a family way longer than we’ve been an actual couple. The first month was kinda rough. I felt awkward about being intimate at home, and so did she, mostly because of the family dynamic we had before. But I think we’re building something really good.

I don’t have much else to update for now, but I’ll definitely share if anything new happens.

I told her about this account, so to the hottest woman alive: you’ve got my heart. Love you, Emilia, my Mila.

1hvo07s,https://www.reddit.com/r/aistory/comments/1hvo07s/tangled_web_of_hearts/,Tangled web of hearts ,"
The humid summer air hung heavy, mirroring the weight in my chest. I traced a pattern on the condensation of my iced coffee, each swirl a reflection of the chaotic dance of emotions churning within me. He – let's call him Liam – had been my constant for months. We'd spent countless nights laughing, cooking together, sharing secrets whispered under the glow of the moon. We were a couple, in every way imaginable, except for the official label. And I had thrived in that ambiguity, or so I’d convinced myself.
Then came the barbecue, the one where his old high school friend, a rather forward woman with a laugh like wind chimes, had tried to flirt with me. Liam, without missing a beat, had placed his hand on my back, a possessive gesture that sent a jolt through me. ""We're dating,"" he'd declared, his voice low and firm. Dating? The word echoed in my mind. It was like a sudden, unexpected downpour after a long drought. My heart had done a little skip, and the thought of ""us"" having that label had actually been pleasing, almost exhilarating.
But that's where the threads of my carefully constructed web started to unravel. I confided in my friend Marco, an old soul with a dry wit, about the confusing mix of emotions. Marco, instead of offering the expected comforting words, exploded. ""Why talk to me about it? Why not Liam?"" His anger, laced with a tinge of something I couldn't quite place, felt like an accusation. It triggered a wave of defensiveness. These were my feelings, my private labyrinth of thoughts. Didn’t I have the right to navigate them with someone I trusted, if I chose to? It felt like a boundary had been crossed.
And looming over everything was the ever-present shadow of Kai. Kai, my ""frienemy"" – a moniker I'd thrown at him in exasperation more than once. He’d been a constant, subtle poison in my ear ever since Liam had entered the picture. He despised Liam, just as vehemently as he had hated my ex, Peter. Kai’s constant whispers, his subtle digs, had planted seeds of doubt and made me second-guess everything. It had been so easy for him to latch on to my relationship with Peter, and now it was the same here with Liam.
Looking back, I realised I had been actively holding myself back, scared of the commitment that Liam seemed to be offering. But why? Was it a fear of vulnerability, a fear of being hurt again? Or was it simply a fear of what Kai, with his constant negativity, might think? His words, “he's not good enough for you,” “you deserve better,” echoed relentlessly in my mind.
Adding to the chaos was the fact that Kai was… infatuated with me. It was a delicate dance of him getting too close, and me having to deploy my arsenal of past dating stories as a shield. “I'm not available,” I’d tell him, a mantra I’d repeated countless times. I’d even had the “cut ties if you can’t be just friends” talk, more times than I cared to count. His response was always the same: a dramatic declaration of how much he valued our friendship, a promise to behave, before falling back into his clingy routine once the cycle reset. One time, he cancelled plans on me just because I had gone on a date, and, when I ghosted him as a result, he had apologized profusely. “I don’t know how many times you will have to do that before I fully leave,” I’d told him. He just wouldn't take the hint.
Then, when Peter and I broke up, Kai had pounced. ""I told you he was terrible,"" he'd said, his eyes gleaming with smug satisfaction. ""Don't you regret it all now?"" I’d surprised him, and myself, when I’d said no. I didn’t regret it. If I hadn’t dated Peter, I might not have had a roof over my head at one point. His smugness had then turned into genuine anger. He couldn't believe I hadn't fallen apart, that a risk I took had actually paid off.
It was then, staring at his frustrated face, that I saw it clearly. Kai didn't want me to be happy; he wanted me to stagnate. He’d taken a gamble once, years ago, and it had worked out for him, but since then, he'd been playing it safe, afraid of anything that might disrupt his carefully constructed life. And he wanted me to play it safe too. He couldn’t handle the fact that I was growing, that I was taking risks. That I was finally moving on.
With a newfound sense of resolve, I decided to confront the chaos head-on. I started with Kai. I wanted answers, I wanted him to admit his manipulation, to finally reveal his true agenda. But he remained steadfast, a broken record of bitterness, relentlessly attacking Liam and everything he stood for.
Next was Liam. My heart hammered against my ribs as I initiated the conversation. Would he finally open up? Would he push me away? To my relief, he did neither. He spoke honestly, finally opening up about his feelings. He admitted that he had feelings for me, that he had been waiting for me to feel the same. My heart soared. It was like a silent, unspoken pact had finally been voiced. I realized I felt that way too.
Finally, I confided in Marco again, this time about Liam. His reaction was not what I’d expected. He looked at me, concern etched on his face. ""Just skip town,"" he said, his voice low with urgency. ""Get out of this toxic situation before it’s too late."" His words, while jarring, had a ring of truth to them. Was I rushing things? Was I blinded by the sudden validation of Liam's feelings?
I sat there now, the cafe buzzing around me, a symphony of clattering cups and quiet conversation. The web I'd been weaving was a mess of tangled threads, each pulling me in a different direction. Kai, with his manipulative games, Liam, with his hopeful gaze, Marco, with his ominous warning. It was overwhelming.
Ultimately, the decision rested with me. Would I choose the comfort of stagnancy with Kai? Would I leap into the unknown with Liam? Or would I heed Marco’s warning and try to find clarity someplace else? The answer wasn’t clear, not yet, but I knew, with a strange certainty, that I couldn’t stay in this place anymore. The choice, as always, was mine, and mine alone. And for the first time in a long time, I felt that my choices would lead me to genuine growth, wherever that might be.",1,1736243220.0,aistory,0,1.0,False

Most days, I wake up as late as I can allow myself without missing my lectures, and then go to bed past midnight.
The problem is, I desperately want to be the kind of person who wakes up at 6am every day, gets to the library when it opens and gets in 2 or 3 productive hours before everyone else wakes up. I feel like every successful person lives like this and by waking up late every day I'm preventing myself from making the most of every day.
I've tried this kind of lifestyle before but I've found that whenever I set myself a very early alarm I either sleep through it, or I feel like I'm on the brink of death all day and I'm constantly dozing off and can't focus on anything (and coffee is no help).

Let's assume that for whatever reason you must have your double espresso shot first thing in the morning (because you hit the gym, or because the whole humanity depends on this). How would you expell any residual amount of caffeine as fast as possible?
I do know that caffeine remains in your body for 10 hours or so, and I've noticed that I get up quite early and less rested when I have coffee first thing in the morning. So I am looking for ways to increase the speed by which the body loses the caffeine. 

I don't take any coffee past 3pm, so the main caffeine intake happens as soon as I get up at around 7am. I use to take a blend of coffee (1/2 espresso shot) and non caffeinated hot beverage (parsley often) at around 2pm, but this is a minor dose.

So that's the problem, fire your best biohacking solutions (avoiding coffee in the morning won't be considered as a solution).

1hvnrc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/OlderMan/comments/1hvnrc7/my_older_man_dilemma/,My Older Man Dilemma,"I’ll start from the beginning and try to keep it brief. 

I am eighteen and living in the UK. I work part-time at a coffee shop, and recently I’ve been given a few of the opening shifts. I’m definitely not a morning person, so I can’t say I enjoy it. But on my very first morning shift, this man walked in to place an order, and for the first time, I felt something I’d never quite felt before, red-in-the-face attraction. It’s strange to admit, because I’ve thought I’d felt that way about someone before, but apparently this man just had an effect on me like no one else.

Over the course of that week, he came in every morning for his coffee, and I started deliberately taking my time with his order just so I could talk to him for a bit. His voice is incredible, deep, smooth, and sophisticated. Based on his face alone, I’d have guessed he was in his thirties, but the grey streaks in his brown hair suggested otherwise. He’s very tall, at least half a foot taller than me, and always so smartly dressed, with every detail of his appearance so thoughtfully put together.

I’d say I’m generally a confident person, so one day I decided to shoot my shot. He seemed surprised but politely shut me down, saying I was far too young for him. Naturally, I asked him how old he was, and it turns out he’s forty-eight. Honestly, hearing that only made me want him more.

I felt a little deflated after that, but I’m not the type to give up so easily. The next time I saw him, I playfully asked, “So I’m not your type then, I guess?” He laughed and replied, “No, you’re exactly my type.” That caught me completely off guard. He went on to assure me that he was flattered and thought I was “beautiful,” “stunning,” and “captivating,” but that the answer was still no.

Even so, I couldn’t stop myself. I started asking for the opening shifts just so I could see him every morning. I’ve been trying to get to know him in the few minutes I have while making his coffee. Lately, he’s become more flirtatious with me, and it feels almost like a game between us. Sometimes the tension is so intense it’s unbearable.

Finally, I decided to push again and asked him out on a date. That’s when he told me why his answer would always be no. He has daughters, and one of them is my age. He explained that the idea of dating someone the same age as his daughter felt too strange for him. I tried to suggest that it could be as harmless or casual as he wanted, but he admitted he didn’t trust himself to keep it that way.

And that’s where I am now. Honestly, this whole thing is consuming my life a bit. I keep taking the early shifts, trying to look my best for work, going to the gym five times a week, and watching what I eat, all in the hopes of improving my chances with him. But is there even a chance? Or should I just switch my shifts and try to move on?

1hvnr9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hvnr9a/the_starlight_beast_part_3/,The Starlight Beast - Part 3,"I jumped back to the reactor room. The sight will stay with me until my last day, whenever that may be. Valan knelt by the reactor, with the mummified body of Dilk in his right hand. He was completely unaware, in the dim light he must have thought Brak ran into the room, hugging his large fuzzy form for comfort. Behind him stood a creature that never should have left the confines of a vodka-fuelled nightmare.

I noticed the hair of a hundred stares first, waving tentacles with eyes from different species; the oculars taken from its previous victims. It had no eyes on its face, not even a proper mouth, just fangs and needles. Its claws shined, each was as sharp and large as a sword, but even worse, its hide started to blister and crackle where the bright light of my flare touched it, oozing a foul-smelling liquid on the floor.

It was too late for Valan, the Beast lunged at him with a scream, though it must have been in terrible pain, and it killed the old Bilox in seconds. It charged after me then, I dived away from the door, and my gun was in my hand the moment I hit the ground, but the Beast refused to come out to the light. I got up and inched back to the room, flare first. The monster vanished already, and I wasn’t sure if it was just invisible, or whether it had even more esoteric abilities.

Valan's desiccated form lay on the ground, his shriveled-up hands still held on to Dilk’s body. The black liquid from the Beast’s wounds coated his clothes and fur, and I gagged as the stench reached my nose. I stumbled out of the reactor room and threw up on the floor. The others still chased after Brak. I dropped the flare, grabbed the reflector, and ran.

I caught up to the others, they were searching the cabins, but the little rodent was nowhere to be found. Fuck, they had no idea how fast the Beast truly was. Gro’llers could hide well, but not from something like this. I leaned on Johann and panted, trying to catch my breath while spittle and vomit dropped on his brown boots from my mouth. He looked at me, then the reflector, and already knew what happened. He took the equipment and gently pushed me to the ground.

""Captain, Suf, in here!"" he yelled.

The duo left a cabin and looked at me quizzing. I told them everything, down to the gory details.

""You won’t find Brak if you haven’t found him already. The Beast is way too fast. And I’m pretty sure it can go through walls, we should have bumped into the bastard when we crowded the room. It somehow got Dilk’s body in there too. There must be something more going on, more than just invisibility, some sort of phasing,"" I realized.

""Impossible, it would have killed us all in minutes,"" Sufar retorted.

""It got Dilk there in thirty seconds, tops. How the hell do you explain that?"" I yelled.

""Vents. The body in the cargo bay fell from a dark gantry, near a vent,"" Johann said. He checked the bathroom next. ""Dilk’s gone, and the vent is open in the back, I didn’t notice it the first time."" Great, now we had to fear the walls too.

The young ones returned with the explosives. They stopped in their tracks when they saw our expressions. Johann grabbed the bombs from Greli without a word and went to the reactor room. I got up and followed him with the reflector. The rest stuck to us like glue. We were down to six so fast, I could barely comprehend it. On the bright side, Nell and Greli found the shaped charges, so we weren’t going to blow up the reactor, I hoped.

The stench was horrible, and Nell stopped before the room to throw up. The captain stayed with her, watching her back. I placed the reflector at the door, it illuminated most of the room, and Johann inspected the bodies.

""Please, don’t touch that shi… why do I even keep trying to warn you idiots?"" Sufar sighed, as Johann put his fingers in a pool of black bile and smelled it after. I gagged, and Greli looked sick as well.

""So you are saying it came from the Beast? You wounded it?"" My friend asked as he played with the viscous bile.

""Yeah, when the light of my flare hit it. It wasn’t the fire though, just the light,"" I answered, holding my nose. There was something strange on his face, or deep in his eyes rather, something I hadn’t before seen during our long years of friendship. I couldn’t quite place it, and he came out of his trance, wiping his hand on the wall. It left a dark mark. We placed the charges.

We considered carrying away the bodies of Valan and Dilk, but they were falling apart as we touched them, so we decided to give their bodies to space instead. Not quite the sailor’s funeral, not the one they deserved anyway, but it was the best we could do right now. We removed the final bolts and cables tethering the reactor, Johann armed the bombs, and we bolted. We had no idea whether the Beast understood what we had planned, or if it could prevent the detonation; I began to think it was more than just an animal. 

We were back in the mess hall in three minutes, the captain took a deep breath and pushed the button. The explosion shook the ship, sending tremors through the old structure. We could see the damaged reactor floating away, along with debris and the bodies of our fallen comrades. And the big reflector. Fuck, that was on me.

Johann grabbed a cig and tossed me another. The warm orange flame of his lighter gave a lively color to his pale face, but something strange still gleamed in his eyes. Not something conscious, just an instinct burning within him, but it made me uncomfortable. I looked at the drained gazes of the rest of my comrades and realized there would be no patrols before we rested a little. I hoped they weren’t necessary anymore, and Nell felt the same way.

""It’s over, right?"" she asked. I wanted to reassure her, but frankly, I had no idea. Nor did Johann or the captain. The walls of the ship were creaking. We certainly lost deck two, and we had to assess the damage quickly. A pipe must have been broken somewhere, and water was dripping on a metal surface somewhere nearby, I knew the slow dripping would drive me crazy in no time. Johann sent the elevator up to the bridge, then back. Thankfully it still worked, we weren’t stuck in the mess hall. With the ship locked on course, our arrival would have delivered a rather unfortunate surprise for the good people of Calan. You would think they were used to it at this point.

After making sure the ship wouldn’t fall apart under our feet, we tried to have a quick lunch. None had an appetite, save for Sufar, who went for a second helping. Greli stood up from the floor. He had more energy left in him than it looked from the outside.

""We will patrol with Nell; you guys are way too tired to…""

""Like hell you are!"" Johann snorted, his cigarette sticking out to the left. ""You two stay here, in the light where we can see you until we are sure the Beast stopped coming after us.""

The teal-furred Bilox protested. ""We are sailors like you, you can’t treat us like…""

""Like hell you are!"" Johann repeated himself louder, his smoke fell to the ground, but he did not care. ""You two are not sailors, not even void-dwellers, you two are kids who made some really shit choices! Once we get to Calan, you two are out of this business, you pick up your salary, you will get my bonus, and you will do something far away from us space-rats! Am I clear?""

The young ones were stunned, their wide eyes staring at Johann. My friend was always calm, even chummy for the most part, and his fury startled all but me. I joined him.

""You’ll get my bonus too, and don’t protest, our story will sell for a lot anyway.""

""Count me in,"" the captain added, ""I’ll tinker with the insurance too.""

We looked at Sufar. He looked back at us.

""Don’t look at me, I earned every cred I’m getting from this accursed trip,"" my green compatriot shrugged. We weren’t the galaxy’s favorites, and not many of us wondered why.

""Guys, you shouldn’t,"" Nell said, and she teared up a little. The captain hugged her tight from behind.

It may seem redundant to stick to a schedule in a situation like this, but keeping your discipline even when your usual reality is falling apart could mean the difference between life and death. By nineteen o’clock ship time, we assessed the damages as best as we could. We got lucky with the bomb, the captain said that even parts of deck two could be traversed in a spacesuit, though none of us wanted to check, so she sealed the area for good. A few pipes broke, and we had to turn off the water in the cargo bay, while we lost electricity in storage. We fixed some of the cables with Johann, and a camera, and a couple of lamps came back to life. The bridge was fine, the cockpit had juice too, and the captain programmed the autopilot to stop in the orbit of Calan. Hopefully, we will miss the port.

Three days passed by in this newfound calm, and there was no sign of the Beast. I hoped the blast killed the monster, but it probably just went away. Sufar must have been right, about the fission attracting the creature. I guessed he used to be a proponent of the humans repelling the Beast hypothesis too, but Johann’s presence on board disproved this theory. We made sure the young ones always stayed in the safest spots though, no need to take unnecessary risks, but we allowed them to keep watch during the night.

We fixed what we could, the old rust bucket would take us to safety it seemed. Johann played his guitar during the ever-longer breaks, and on the second day, I accidentally found Nell’s stuffed doll she slept with. It was like a small version of the Tvelani girl, soft pink plush body, with light-blue hair in braids. She always kept it with her, it was a childhood memento. We gave her a good ribbing, but deep down I think we all found it adorable. She quickly became the heart of our group, always having a few good words for those who needed it, and as her fear subsided, her upbeat nature became apparent. The Beast was a rare sight, but Nell’s spirit was even rarer, for us gruff sailors anyway. After dinner, Greli showed us some card tricks, it was likely the first time he found a genuinely eager audience. Even Sufar, that sardonic jerk seemed to warm up to the rest of us.

Nothing suspicious happened since we flushed the reactor, but the ship’s hallways felt much smaller, suffocating, even though we were far below skeleton crew numbers. We stopped patrolling after the second night, although someone always stayed up on watch duty while the others rested. It was Greli's turn now and we went to sleep. We switched to dimmer lights in the mess hall, which was our barracks now, and it made it a lot easier for Sufar and me to doze off.

I woke up in the middle of the night and glanced at Greli on instinct. The Bilox lad snored a little, he lay passed out in the armchair and drooled on his shoulder. Oh well, it was almost my shift anyway. I got up, my eyes somewhat adjusting to the darkness, and I went to make coffee. I carefully stepped over Nell, she muttered something in her sleep and cradled her doll to her chest. I thought about leaping over Johann and the captain, but I didn’t want to kick them accidentally, so I went around the table instead. I leaned over the quick-oven, the green LED numbers read 1:37 on the clock. I pondered making coffee for everyone, but it's better when it’s fresh I decided, and yawned to reinforce my need for all the caffeine. They can make some in the morning.

I turned on the machine, it gave off the soft red glow I loved so much and started humming. Fuck, I should also add some new coffee to it, using the grounds a second time was an old sailor’s trick, but one I always hated. I fumbled around, almost knocking over Johann’s guitar as I searched for that blessed green box. My hands got tangled up in something soft and dry, somebody must have put some packaging in the corner, but I couldn’t exactly see what it was in the dark. Wait, who turned off the lights?

TORNOTO, Jan. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **White Gold Corp. (TSX.V: WGO, OTCQX: WHGOF, FRA: 29W** ) (the "" **Company** "") is pleased to announce it has filed a technical report in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects to update the Mineral Resource Estimate (“ **MRE** ”) on its 100% owned flagship White Gold Project (“ **the Project** ”). The technical report entitled “2024 Technical Report for the White Gold Project, Dawson Range, Yukon, Canada” and dated January 3, 2025 (effective date October 28, 2024) has been prepared for the Company by Dr. Gilles Arseneau, P.Geo. of ARSENEAU Consulting Services Inc. (“ **ACS** ”). The technical report is available on SEDAR ([www.sedar.com](http://www.sedar.com)) under the Company’s issuer profile.

The Project is located (Figure 1) approximately 95 km south of Dawson City in west-central Yukon, Canada and is located 33 km north from the advanced Coffee project owned by Newmont Corporation with Indicated Resources of 2.14 Moz at 1.23 g/t Au, and Inferred Resources of 0.23 Moz at 1.01 g/t Au (2) , and 58 km northwest from Western Copper and Gold Corporation’s Casino project, which has Measured and Indicated Resources of 7.6 billion lb Cu and 14.5 Moz Au and Inferred Resources of 3.3 billion lb Cu and 6.6 Moz Au (3)

The updated mineral resource includes a significant increase in total gold ounces, including an 18.5% increase in inferred resources and a 4.3% increase in indicated resources (see Company News Release dated November 19, 2024). The White Gold project now comprises 1,203,000 ounces of gold in the Indicated Resource category (17.7 million tonnes averaging 2.12 g/t Au) and 1,116,600 ounces of gold in the Inferred Resource category (24.5 million tonnes averaging 1.42 g/t Au) at US$2,000/oz gold. The gold resources at the White Gold Project are near surface, almost entirely captured within open pits, and remain open for expansion in multiple directions with additional opportunities to increase total resources via targets within close proximity. Additional increases to the size of the resource may also be possible through an ongoing analysis of the resource block model and by capturing additional ounces hosted within the Target for Further Exploration area which hosts an additional estimated 10 – 12 million tonnes grading between 1 – 2 g/t Au. These results form part of the Company’s work program supported by strategic partners including Agnico Eagle Mines Limited and Kinross Gold Corporation.

“The filing of the updated MRE technical report on our flagship White Gold Project represents another significant milestone on the continued growth and advancement of our deposits, which now ranks as one of the highest-grade undeveloped open-pittable gold deposits in Canada. Several opportunities exist to continue to expand the resource size through further drilling, nearby targets and optimization of the resource block model and the significant Target for Further Exploration area which remains largely underexplored. We look forward to continuing to unlock the gold and critical mineral endowment of our prospective district scale land package in a tier 1 jurisdiction which has such a prolific history and prospectivity” stated David D’Onofrio, Chief Executive Officer.

**Highlights:**

* 17.660 million tonnes of Indicated Resources averaging 2.12 grams per tonne gold for 1.203 million ounces of gold, representing 52% of total resources.
* 24.472 million tonnes of Inferred Resources averaging 1.42 grams per tonne gold for 1.117 million ounces of gold, representing 48% of total resources.
* Inferred and Indicated Mineral Resources have increased by 18.5% and 4.3% respectively, compared to the previous 2023 MRE (

1. 

* 97.5% of the resources are near surface and within an open-pit. Indicated Resources of 1.201 million ounces of gold averaging 2.12 grams per tonne gold (an increase of 6.7%) and open-pit Inferred Resources of 1.061 million ounces of gold averaging 1.38 grams per tonne gold (an increase of 24.4%).
* Mineralization at the Golden Saddle, Arc, Ryan’s Surprise and VG deposits all remain open along strike and down dip to further expand the deposits and in addition to multiple underexplored targets in close proximity.
* The project also hosts an additional estimated 10 – 12 million tonnes grading between 1 – 2 g/t Au of material classified as a Target for Further Exploration which has not been included in the current resource which may further increase the size of the resource and is currently being evaluated in this regard.
* The Company is also currently evaluating additional opportunities to further increase the size of the resources by optimizing the block model and wireframes of the Golden Saddle and Arc deposits to add additional tonnage.
* Additional results from the Company’s work program to be released in due course

1. *Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.*
2. *The estimate of Mineral Resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues.*
3. *The Inferred Mineral Resource in this estimate has a lower level of confidence than that applied to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to a Mineral Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of the Inferred Mineral Resource could be upgraded to an Indicated Mineral Resource with continued exploration.*
4. *The Mineral Resources in this report were estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM), CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by the CIM Council.*
5. *Open pittable resources are constrained by GEOVIA Whittle optimized pit shells using a 0.35 g/t Au cut-of grade and are considered to have reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction, assuming a gold price of US$2,000 per ounce, a C$:US$ exchange rate of 0.75. an open pit mining cost of CDN$3.25 per tonne, a processing and G&A cost of CDN$27.50 per tonne milled, and gold recoveries of 92% for Golden Saddle, and VG, along with 85% for Arc and Ryan’s Surprise. Underground resources assume a mining cost of CDN$120/tonne.*
6. *The following bulk density values for mineralized material were used: Golden Saddle (2.62 – 2.65 t/m* *3* *), Arc (2.55 t/m* *3* *), Ryan’s Surprise (2.63 t/m* *3* *) and VG (2.65 t/m* *3* *).*
7. *High-grade gold assay values have been capped as follows: Golden Saddle and Arc (8 – 18 g/t Au), Ryan’s Surprise (9 g/t Au) and VG (3 – 10 g/t Au).*
8. *The Statement of Estimates of Mineral Resources has been compiled by Mr. Gilles Arseneau, Ph.D.,P.Geo, of ARSENEAU Consulting Services (“ACS”). Mr. Arseneau has sufficient experience that is relevant to the style of mineralization and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity that he has undertaken to qualify as a Qualified Person as defined in the CIM Standards of Disclosure.*
9. *All numbers are rounded. Overall numbers may not be exact due to rounding.*

The current MRE for the White Gold project was carried out by Arseneau Consulting Services (“ACS”) of Vancouver, B.C. and is reported in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”) and has been estimated in conformity with generally accepted Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (“CIM”) “Estimation and Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Best Practices” guidelines. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.

The MRE presents updated estimates for the Golden Saddle, Arc, Ryan’s Surprise and VG deposits (Figures 2-5).

The updated MRE was prepared using a block model approach using ordinary kriging interpolation for the Golden Saddle, Arc and VG deposits and inverse distance squared (“ID2”) interpolation for the Ryan’s Surprise deposit. Block model sizes varied between deposits as follows: Golden Saddle and Arc (10 m); Ryan’s Surprise (5 – 10 m); and VG (10 – 20 m). GEMS 6.8.4 software was used for generating gold mineralization solids, a topography surface, and resource estimation. Statistical analysis and resource validations were performed using non-commercial software and with Sage2001. Near surface resources were constrained using GEOVIA Whittle pit optimization software. Pit slopes in rock were assumed at 50° and the MRE assumes a long-term gold price of US$2,000 per ounce. Gold recoveries used were 92% for the Golden Saddle and VG deposits, and 85% for the Arc and Ryan’s Surprise deposits. Gold recoveries are based on metallurgical testwork results for the Golden Saddle and Arc deposits and are assumed for the Ryan’s Surprise and VG deposits based on their close similarities to the Arc and Golden Saddle deposits, respectively.

Mineralization on portions of both the Golden Saddle and Arc deposits is known to extend beyond the limits of the current resource estimate, however, the mineralization in these areas did not meet the criteria to be classified as Mineral Resources. Based on drilling at Golden Saddle and current geologic models, there is an estimated 10 – 12 million additional tonnes grading between 1 – 2 g/t Au of material classified as a Target for Further Exploration (“TFFE”). The reader should be cautioned that the potential quantity and grade of the TFFE is conceptual in nature. There has been insufficient drilling to define a mineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being advanced to a mineral resource. These zones form more continuous mineralized units at US$ 2,000/oz gold and the Company plans to further evaluate this mineralization through re-modelling and optimization of the block model and wire frames to determine if it can be incorporated in future resource estimates.

**Resources & Opportunities in the White Gold District**

West-central Yukon is host to several highly prospective mineral districts, including the White Gold, Dawson Range, Klondike and Sixtymile districts. The Klondike was the epicentre of the historic Klondike Gold Rush in 1896 with over 20 million ounces of placer gold production having occurred in the region since that time. The Company’s property portfolio, which covers large portions of the White Gold District, was assembled by renowned prospector Shawn Ryan, and represents the largest claim package in the region, consisting of 15,876 claims across 26 properties and covering approximately 315,000 hectares. Two significant advanced projects border the Company’s claims in the south including the Coffee project owned by Newmont Corporation with Indicated Resources of 2.14 Moz at 1.23 g/t Au, and Inferred Resources of 0.23 Moz at 1.01 g/t Au (2) , and Western Copper and Gold Corporation’s Casino project, which has Measured and Indicated Resources of 7.6 billion lb Cu and 14.5 Moz Au and Inferred Resources of 3.3 billion lb Cu and 6.6 Moz Au (3)

All four of White Gold’s near-surface deposits are interpreted to represent structurally-controlled orogenic gold deposits, collectively form the Company’s gold resource base in the heart of its large land package, and remain open for expansion.

**Qualified Persons, Technical Information and Quality Control**

The MRE for the White Gold Project was prepared by Dr. Gilles Arseneau of Arseneau Consulting Services (ACS), an Independent Qualified Person (“QP”) as defined under NI 43-101, who has reviewed and approved the contents of this news release. The technical content of this news release has also been reviewed and approved by Terry Brace, P.Geo. and Vice President of Exploration for the Company who is also a QP as defined under NI 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure of Mineral Projects.

**QA/QC**

White Gold’s drill core sampling consisted of collecting samples over 0.50 m to 2.50 m intervals (depending on lithology and style of mineralization) over the entire hole length. RC samples were collected at continuous 1.5 m intervals. All drill core was cut in half using a diamond saw, with half of the core placed in sample bags and the other half returned to the core box. Standard, blank, and duplicate samples were inserted into both the drill core and RC sample streams at regular intervals to meet a designated QA/QC sample insertion rate. All samples were organized into batches, flown via fixed-wing aircraft from camp, and transported via courier to an ISO-certified laboratory for analysis.

**About White Gold Corp.**

The Company owns a portfolio of 15,876 quartz claims across 26 properties covering approximately 315,000 hectares (3,150 km 2 ) representing approximately 40% of the Yukon’s emerging White Gold District. The Company’s flagship White Gold project hosts four near-surface gold deposits which collectively contain an estimated 1,203,000 ounces of gold in Indicated Resources and 1,116,600 ounces of gold in Inferred Resources (this news release). Regional exploration work has also produced several other new discoveries and prospective targets on the Company’s claim packages which border sizable gold discoveries including the Coffee project owned by Newmont Corporation with Measured and Indicated Resources of 2.1 Moz at 1.28 g/t gold and Inferred Resources of 0.2 Moz at 1.04 g/t gold (2) , and Western Copper and Gold Corporation’s Casino project which has Measured and Indicated Resources of 7.6 Blb copper and 14.5 Moz gold and Inferred Resources of 3.3 Blb copper and 6.6 Moz gold (3)

Arriving late on the 28th, MSY was a refreshing sight after the severe underwhelm we experienced at JFK. While JFK was a glorified bus station, MSY was the opposite, modern, easy to navigate, spacious, well-lit, restrooms are clean and staff are friendly. Security wait time was a few minutes when we were on our way to TX.

We ubered to our hotel, the W New Orleans in the FQ, the hotel was good for us, a childless couple, as is any W, and was the perfect stop from which we explored NOLA, they charge a $30 nightly destination fee(?) which we could redeem daily in the hotel's restaurant although the restaurant was always out of things we wanted to order on the two times we went there, they also included a walking tour as a perk but we never bothered because we had already planned a lot for our trip.

We went out around 7 PM to walk Bourbon Street, we saw the bars and people-watched, we enjoyed the vibe there and got out before any projectile vomiting due late at night as I was warned, we walked on Canal St. before we landed in Muriel's as a last minute option for our first night, we wanted to do po' boys from Verti Marte but figured we are too tired for that and just settled for Muriel's (all culinary reviews are at the bottom), we ran back to the hotel after dinner as there was a thunderstorm and we did not pack an umbrella. 

We started our second day well-rested, we picked up coffee from a PJ's, made our way to the riverwalk outlets to do a little shopping (I know, cringe, but we never see these prices back home, it is impossible to resist), walked by the river all the way up to the French Market, had Loretta's authentic pralines, a N'awlins po'boy and some oysters from J's Seafood. We walked back to the hotel to rest before our dinner at Mr. B's then we called it an early night after dinner.

On the 30th, we visited the Whitney Plantation which was eye opening and packed a lot for us learn, we thoroughly enjoyed it. After we made our way back to the city, we walked from the FQ to Lil Dizzy's for lunch then walked back to the hotel for some rest before our last dinner at Seaworthy. We walked in the evening to the restaurant then walked back to the hotel.

On our way out of NOLA, we had cafe au lait and beignets from Cafe du Monde at the airport.

We left early on the 31st and watched the news on the 1st, what happened is incredibly heartbreaking and we hope businesses recover fast, we fell in love with NOLA's people and wish this does not hit them hard as we understand that a lot of people rely mainly on the holidays to make money.

Reviews:
🆗️Muriel's: the shrimp & goat cheese crepes were excellent and so was the bread pudding. However, the redfish was just ok and the gumbo was disappointing, although we don't  have any gumbo reference but we felt they could have done a lot better.

✅️Loretta's authentic pralines: those crab beignets were something and the traditional ones were so good, loved it.

❌️N'awlins: don't, very bad po' boy.

🆗️J's Seafood: if you are picky about your oysters, avoid, they are just okay.

✅️Lil Dizzy's: worth the wait in the line, loved everything. The fried chicken, the catfish, mac n cheese, dirty rice and fries. Everything tasted good, great food and service. PS: we did pass by a Key's Fuel Mart on our way to Dizzy's and contemplated eating there but felt a little uncomfortable, it was the middle of the day.

✅️Seaworthy: Their lobster roll was the best I have ever had, so delicious. Oysters, especially the gulf coast ones, were incredible. Service was great and we did not have wait in a long line to be seated because they accept reservations (and pretty strict about them!)

🆗️Cafe du Monde: get out of the line and head to Loretta's, the beignets there are far more superior they are actually worth the wait. 

👑 Mr. B's: so we did not have a reservation until 2 PM on the day we dined there, we passed by on our way back from the French Market to see if we can get one, my husband liked the ambience and saw how much I wanted to eat there, he told a lovely gentleman there that we flew for 14 hours to make it to the US and that I was non-stop regretting not booking there earlier. We were still denied a table. Just as we were accepting defeat and asking about the wait time for walk-ins with puppy eyes, they gave us a table! We could not believe it, and so we went back for dinner like kids heading to Disneyland, ordered the BBQ shrimp (wow!), the crabcake, the duck springrolls and the garlic truffle fries, everything tasted amazing so although we knew we shouldn't have, we ordered the bread pudding and the lemon ice box pie, both were fantastic, we left a 50% tip and I would have left more if it wasn't for my husband telling me to curb myself. Thanks to Scott and Brett, this was the highlight of our NOLA trip.

It's my first time doing fictional story writing since high school. I also decided to split this story into a couple of parts, so here's the first two chapters. This story was also based on a weird dream I had. You also may notice that I tried to incorporate two different point of views from the primary two characters of the story. This was very much inspired from the swindle series. 



Chapter 1:

November, 2024

Jacklyn (Andy) Anderson



The night had always been my shield. Whenever I felt alone and down, I would glance at the moon and a smile creeps up on my cheek. Going down the interstate, I noticed that the clouds had covered the moon tonight. It was especially dark as a dense fog had set in. 

I parked my cruiser on the side and pushed my seat back. *It’s gonna be a long night*, I thought.  It’s always a long night patrolling the highways. After 11:00pm, traffic dies down in the Southwest. These double-laned interstates attract only wild animals at night. The darkness is then lit up by my phone, a message from Josh.

“Grabbing McDonald’s, want anything?”

Josh has been a friend since high school. He joined the academy two cohorts before me and had completed his probation a year ago. I was such an introvert when I was a teenager that he was close to the only person that ever talked to me. He actually wanted to be a helicopter pilot, so when he heard the recruiters' little spiel about Arkansas State Police’s Aerial Division, he signed right up. On the contrary, I followed my family path in law enforcement. 

In the past six months when I got off my probation we’ve been trying to fit our shifts on the same days. Finally, last month, the watch commander gave the thumbs up. Understand that Sergeant Kelly most definitely regretted that decision the day after as our eight hours proved the most unproductive. 

“Yeah can you get me a 10 piece nugget and an iced coffee please?”

“Give me like 10 minutes.”

We have different districts and regions of highways that we’re supposed to patrol each shift. Since we’re assigned to the same region on the same shift, we typically just park our cruisers either down the interstate or right next to each other. 

I look up from my phone in my rear-view mirror and see a set of bright white lights closing up on me. My cruiser’s speed-radar lit up red at 120 miles per hour.

A black-colored sedan races by me, rocking my cruiser. I kicked my seat back up, clipped my seatbelt, flicked on my blue lights, and it was go time. 

Two miles down, it was nothing but darkness illuminated by my flashing blue and white lights. I've caught up to the sedan who at this moment understood that I’m not a fan of what it just did, pulled over to the right side. I called into the radio for a traffic stop and ran the plates on my almost broken MDT working only on hopes and prayers. Plates come back clean.

 

Chapter 2:

November, 2024

Joshua (Josh) Randal



The cashier handed me the bag of goodies, which I secured behind my center console. As I’m merging back onto the interstate I hear over the radio “Lima-322, for a 10-11”. *Andy got someone*. I was about a minute down the road anyway so I attached myself to the call, “Lima-320, attaching to that 10-11”. 

I parked behind the flashing blue lights and got out of the cruiser with the order. 

I placed the goodies on Andy’s trunk. ""Goodies are on me, coach’s kid."" Andy’s dad, Lieutenant Colonel Lance Anderson, recently just got promoted to the Colonel of the Arkansas State Police. 

“Thank you thank you thank you”, she said while making praying gestures with her hands, “got her at 120, plate came back clean”.

“Alright one sec... I gotta grab my hat”.

We approached the vehicle on both sides. Andy shined the flashlight at the driver, gesturing for the window to roll down. She is probably in her late twenties or early thirties, with curly hair and a dashing rose colored dress. She was frantically trying to send a text before looking up and meeting my gaze. I felt almost instantly attached to her gaze. The unfortunate part is an open container of vodka in her cup-holder. I glance up at Andy who seems to be having the time of her life holding back laughter at my blushed cheeks. 

“I should have taken a picture of your face and made it my screen-saver” she says with a wink.

I gave my best innocent smile back at her and walked to my cruiser and took off my hat, grabbed a quick sip of coffee before walking back. Andy already had the driver climb out for a field sobriety test. She handed me the documents and asked me to go to her cruiser to run them. I cursed a couple times when the tough-book shut down as I was about to hit the query button. Finally, after five long and frustrating minutes, the profile loaded. *Mariah Fowler, active warrant for: drug trafficking*. My jaws instantly clenched. I look up at Andy, who already has Mariah in handcuffs and is patting her down. “Hey Andy,” I walked over to the head of the vehicle, “She’s got a warrant”. I peeked at the front plate of the vehicle. As I expected, the front plates are missing. I’m theorizing that she might have ripped the plates off of another car that had the same make and model. Just as I was about to return to the cruiser to run the car’s registration and insurance, the sound of screeching tires tore through the foggy silence. Two blacked-out SUVs swerved to a stop next to us, their engines growling like a warning. ",1,1736241488.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

The café wants a logo that is simple and modern with a symbol that can be used on its own as well. The café wants to specialize on local and environmentally friendly products. It’s interior is modern yet cozy, which should be reflected in the logo.

Additional info to the logo: I‘ve tried to combine a coffee mug with a speech bubble, literally translating the name ""Kaffeeklatsch"" into a symbol. I also incorporated leaves to get the ""environmentally friendly / local products"" part across.

The secret to the hard determinist position is never saying what it is that I can't do other than because as soon as they name it I can empirically prove them wrong. Only by never saying what it is that I can't do other than can they continue their belief. 

When they do say it, it so banal as to be meaningless. I can not do other than what I'm going to do. Which just begs the question what is it that I am going to do? Just let me know and we will see whether I can do otherwise. So the question to hard determinists is which is it? Coffee or tea that I can't do otherwise tomorrow?

We all met in college. Dan (48M) and Lisa (45F) are high school sweethearts. They're been married for about 25 years. They're been having some issues the past year. I tried to talk to Lisa about it and she was so cold to me. Well, around the beginning of November, Dan asked to meet up for coffee. We've never hung out one on one, but I thought maybe it had to do with Lisa, so I agreed. Well, it was kind of about Lisa, Dan said she hated me because he confessed to her that he has feelings for me and has had them for awhile. I was horrified because I didn't do anything to make him feel that way. I told him ew, the feelings not mutual, and he said that's ok, he just needed me to know and didn't expect anything of me. I immediately left and tried to call Lisa. She said she didn't hate me, was just upset about the situation. 

I decided I wanted nothing to do with Dan. I won't do any group activities with our friend group if Dan is there. Lisa told our friend group exactly why, then was mad at me for ""punishing everyone and not getting over it when she did"". We used to do things as a group at least twice a month.

So my ex came back from Cabo on January 2nd. I had just turned 25 and was feeling like I was completely done with that chapter.My Ex BF contacted me about January 3 or 4th to go for coffee to get a coffee together and talk some things out. 

I blocked him so he asked me through a mutual friend. At first I didn't want to go, I was done and over it so I was ready to just leave him on a f*ck you. However curiousity killed the cat. 

I decided to go based on having an apology and saying to his face we are done. My resolve was unwavering but at the restaurant things went in a different direction. Before I go further I need to clarify some things to make the story make sense:

1. He and I have known each other 11 years.
2. He had a crush on me for 10 years
3. In highschool I never dated guys or girls. I was asked out as a joke in middle school so I never dated in highschool due to that trauma. After therapy and some healing I am fine and accept dating questions easier.
4. He asked me put in the sweetest love confession I heard in years

So with that info out there at Brunch, he had a plate of eggs, bacon, and toast, while I got coffee and a pastry. I thought it would be an in and out sort of situation. 

Ex had a different idea he asked how I was, small talk questions, then came his ""apology.""

Basically Ex said that he never meant to hurt me, and that it was not nice treating someone he prized so well like he did. He will never do it again to someone he treasured, and he would like one more chance he fought so hard to win me over the ten years and didn't want to lose like that.

Processing everything I realize what he was doing for his pride. He didn't view me as a true girlfriend he wants to see in the future. He viewed me as something won and basically a prize.

I got annoyed and left once he finished his apology finalizing the end of our relationship with me paying for my coffee, walking out to my car and driving to my best friend's house. 

The sentiment was nice but his word choice definitely was not what I expected. I haven't heard from him since and am happy I completely moved on.

We go to bed and in the morning we made coffee and all sat around the fire. Well after minute into sitting down everyone becomes silent for some reason. It lasted for what seemed to be about 2 minutes and one of my date’s friends then goes “this is devastating”. I asked “what’s devastating” but he doesn’t say. I ignored it and things went back to normal.

1hvncmd,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1hvncmd/its_only_now_that_i_realized_that_my_mom_and_dad/,It's only now that I realized that my mom and dad never said I was a good person.,"That's basically it. I never heard that I was a good person from my parents. On the contrary, ever since I was a child, my mother constantly emphasized how bad of a person I was, that I gave her a lot of trouble, and that I had done a lot of mischief. I was a child, so I believed that the mistakes I had made as a child were the worst mistakes in the world, and that only a psychopath would make the same mistakes as me, and that for that reason I was the worst person on the planet.

I grew up believing this, that I was a horrible person because my mother constantly told me that I had done a lot of mischief. I grew up carrying a huge amount of guilt in my chest, and thinking that I should be eternally grateful to my mother.

My mother poisoned my father's head, who also thought I was a horrible person.

It was confusing for me to see my friends’ mothers defending them with all their might and emphasizing how good their children were, and that the mistakes they made were due to the influence of bad friends.

In my house, my mother said the opposite about me. She said that I was the bad influence and that I hurt my friends.  My mother never stood up for me. Never. If someone complained about me, she would join them in complaining about me too. I want to emphasize that I was never a troublemaker. I was a studious child, isolated from my peers. I didn’t go out, I didn’t have any friends, and my hobby was reading. As a teenager, I became religious, so I never left the house except to go to church. But my mother constantly emphasized that I was a bad person who had done horrible things. And she told everyone this, including the pastor of our old church.

As an adult, in one of our arguments, my mother once again threw in my face that I owed her, and that I was a horrible person who had done horrible things. So I asked her: what horrible things had I done, that I never knew about? To which she replied, ""You know very well what you did!"" And then I asked her again what I did, because I really didn't know, and then she didn't answer.

The same thing happened in the following arguments, she said that I had done horrible things, I asked her what horrible things were these that made me a horrible person, and she didn't answer.

It was and is like that in every fight.

The thing is that all of this caused me a huge emotional wound. Because I grew up believing that I was really a bad person, without having any idea that my mistakes were common and that everyone made the same mistakes as me (like lying, for example, or skipping school, or watching cartoons, since in our house it was forbidden to watch cartoons, because my mother said they were from the devil, so when I saw cartoons I really believed that I had sinned). For me, in my head until the beginning of adulthood, the mistakes I made were similar to killing someone, stealing, kidnapping, some absurd crime. So I grew up carrying a huge guilt in my heart while I believed that I was a horrible person.

Last year, an acquaintance of mine was talking to me and told me that I was a good person and I cried.

We were both at the mall talking and having coffee, and in the middle of the conversation she said this: You are a good person.

I cried. It was the first time I had heard that in my entire life: that I was a good person.

Yes, the first time in my life I heard that I was a good person was when I was 32.

I have been undergoing therapy and medication with a psychiatrist, which has helped me a lot in many aspects of my life, but there are still emotional ""holes"" in my heart that I cannot heal on my own. Understanding that I am not a bad person is one of them. Because I will be honest with you, I am very cruel to myself, because I learned to be cruel to myself from my mother who was extremely cruel to me.

It would be nice to hear from someone every now and then that I am a good person. It would be wonderful. Yes, this phrase is important to me.

He is my uncle my mom is his older sister out of 8 siblings she basically raised all her siblings due to her mom (my grandma) having to work full time and going through the process of being an immigrant/single mother, well my grandpa was kinda there but he was a gambling alcoholic most days. But The toxic family member in this story is my uncle. My mom was also a single mother to my older brother at 20 so she took care of her little brother while raising her son by herself. And then 10 years later had me at 30. My mom made him my god father at a pretty young age, so I can’t blame him for not being the strongest father figure. (I never knew my dad)
Me and him have both struggled growing up. we kinda grew up together except I was a toddler and he was a teenager. He always made me laugh and took me to the corner store to buy candy, one day he just wasn’t around anymore. Turns out he went to prison for a couple years in his 20s, for theft of something. I didn’t realize till he was coming back home and everyone started arguing. I never knew what about tho since I was so young. When he got out he got a job and was trying to be better i guess but he never got out of the struggle bus. 
We have a family house that my grandma owns, my mom, my aunts and this same uncle live here paying my grandma the rent. for as long as I’ve known he never paid rent for real and kept getting half kicked out the house. After a while my grandma let him stay in the garage and fixed it up with ac and a mattress as long had he helped her with yard work and things like that. The Problems never really ended he was alway short tempered did the bare minimum when it came to cleaning after himself and random arguments came and went one day my aunt wasn’t talking to him the next my mom wasn’t talking to him. By this time I was in high school and I did my best not to step on his toes and not to bother him since he yelled at me once or twice about petty things. 
My mom really did not like the person he turned out to be, And i agree. He calls women hoes and only thinks about himself, he’ll eat anyone else’s groceries but throw a fit if someone ate his, and he talks shit about everyone in the house to their kids (me and my cousins) or anyone who will listen. he had no respect for anyone not even my grandma ‘his mom’ I’ve seen random people come to the house asking for names I’ve never heard of, turns out he’s selling things he finds in the back yard (my grandma is a bit of a horder) just to buy weed with the little bit of money he can make. He also has a different girl over every night has always been a man whore and I think he came in my room one night while my friends were sleeping over and stole one of my friends card information either that or he found her wallet and took down her information. I went outside one day and saw a go puff order with my friends name on it, she said she never sent anything to my house. She keeps getting random charges on her card. Inside the bag was condoms and strawberries. I never confronted and he never asked me about it tho but nothing can explain his name on some of the random charges other than that. Sometimes things would go missing like every one of my lighters, my drinks, my friends school ring she accidentally left in the bathroom (never found), and one time my cousins friend left his rollex in the bathroom after a shower and the friend found my uncle in the living room taking pictures with it.
He became very questionable to me i stopped trusting him to be honest. He’s been taking my things tho I never get really bothered by it, I bought little coffee a table from a thrift and it disappeared after a couple of months and it was in the garage, he needed it more than me tho…
So here is the current story my last straw i would love advice cuz i don’t know what to do and im honestly so emotional. 
Keep in mind i am a collector so i have way to many clothes, trinkets and stuffed animals but im also an artist so i have art stuff that cost a lot and i love vintage things so i have things like that too.
A couple of months ago i got pregnant and moved out the family house and into a studio with my fiancé. For the weeks i was out the house i was going back and forth to Check up on my cats and my stuff. my little cousin decided he wanted my room. I had no problem with this as long as my stuff was ok. Every day that I came back things looked more cluttered and shoved around. But I had no truck or time or money to get my things. So stupidly i procrastinated getting my stuff. My grandma and my little cousin (who was staying in my room) ended up getting into an argument after she asked him to help her get something out her car and he said “nah im tired”, he also wasn’t going to school, or paying rent, and the room was a mess, so instead of kicking him out or making him clean up she cleaned up after him, (she told him she would rent out the room unless he went to school or started paying rent) I called her when I heard about it, (cuz now my things would have to be moved) I told her my stuff is in there and I’ll come get them soon, she said not to worry about it, that i don’t need to worry that she would help me pack it and keep everything safely stored in the house. Ofc that didn’t happen I went to check on my things meanwhile it had only been a couple of weeks since i moved and days since she said my not to worry about my things, and so many things were missing i had not yet realized things were thrown out like my vintage vanity and a art set worth $100. My mom said she saw my grandma put some of my things in her car and tried her best to take them out. So i urgently take the boxes home regretting trusting my grandma. A couple days later i go to my grandma’s apartment and she literally has my vintage glass figurines on her shelves and little things from my room around and i end up stealing them back from her, (I don’t like confrontation) thankfully she also took my laundry basket and a duffle bag of mine so it wasn’t to hard to collect my things and go. Anyway I still had bags of clothes and stuffed animals and art things at the family house so I keep going back when I can to neatly put stuff together and grab what I can fit into the car. Also my new place is 30 minutes away and my fiancé works many hours and I’m pregnant so it isn’t easy to go back and forth. It’s also really dirty at the family house and have dust allergies and nobody cares about the cats so the kittens that happen to be born randomly all have eye infections and my pregnant self is cleaning after them all at the same time. I slowly got over that situation after it kept me up at night. I went through a bit of a morning/grief after losing so many things.
I’m gonna get on with my the toxic uncle story so my mom helps me neatly place the rest of my things and we put my clothes and stuffed animals in boxes on the porch I thought they’d be safe since I’d be back for them to wash them when I could, I didn’t think they’d do that to me again and throw more of my little life aways but my uncle did he wanted to be petty since my grandma refurbished the garage and the family agreed my mom would move into it since she was paying the most rent anyways. This left my uncle homeless maybe 2 days and one night while my mom moved her stuff out her room. (She did it all by herself moving her whole life. She did it very fast considering her health problems. My uncle and my mom have been in a silent feud for year’s now and so he for sure wasn’t gonna help her. And I couldn’t do much since I was like 6 months pregnant) So yeah he has no right to bully my mother, I’m guessing out of anger he’s been moving her outside storage boxes in the rain like old photo albums and things like that. He fucked up tho cuz I think he thought the boxes on the porch were just my moms but they were mine too and the other day he put them in bulk. So devastatingly my last bit of clothes and my had to be hundreds of dollars of squishmallos and my childhood plushies gone. Just gone. Plus some of it was my mom’s laundry like sheets and rugs. He claims “he thought it was all trash” which is lies since there’s is actual trash all around the house. Anywho I’m just a girl and I want revenge but i actually think he might hurt me but like I wanna flood his room with the hose or convince the family to actually get him kicked out but I don’t wanna be like him. I keep telling myself karma is coming but my tears won’t replace my stuffiessss. I may just ask him to pay me back for them and document everything and sue him when I have the money idk… help. I just want to feel better I really want my plushies too🤧

1hvnai9,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsHeTheAsshole/comments/1hvnai9/is_my_family_member_toxic_or_am_i_overreacting/,Is my family member toxic or am I overreacting ,"I am 19(f) pregnant and the family members is 36(m) I won’t name Names just out of respect. He is my uncle my mom is his older sister out of 8 siblings she basically raised all her siblings due to her mom (my grandma) having to work full time and going through the process of being an immigrant/single mother, well my grandpa was kinda there but he was a gambling alcoholic most days. But The toxic family member in this story is my uncle. My mom was also a single mother to my older brother at 20 so she took care of her little brother while raising her son by herself. And then 10 years later had me at 30. My mom made him my god father at a pretty young age, so I can’t blame him for not being the strongest father figure. (I never knew my dad)
Me and him have both struggled growing up. we kinda grew up together except I was a toddler and he was a teenager. He always made me laugh and took me to the corner store to buy candy, one day he just wasn’t around anymore. Turns out he went to prison for a couple years in his 20s, for theft of something. I didn’t realize till he was coming back home and everyone started arguing. I never knew what about tho since I was so young. When he got out he got a job and was trying to be better i guess but he never got out of the struggle bus. 
We have a family house that my grandma owns, my mom, my aunts and this same uncle live here paying my grandma the rent. for as long as I’ve known he never paid rent for real and kept getting half kicked out the house. After a while my grandma let him stay in the garage and fixed it up with ac and a mattress as long had he helped her with yard work and things like that. The Problems never really ended he was alway short tempered did the bare minimum when it came to cleaning after himself and random arguments came and went one day my aunt wasn’t talking to him the next my mom wasn’t talking to him. By this time I was in high school and I did my best not to step on his toes and not to bother him since he yelled at me once or twice about petty things. 
My mom really did not like the person he turned out to be, And i agree. He calls women hoes and only thinks about himself, he’ll eat anyone else’s groceries but throw a fit if someone ate his, and he talks shit about everyone in the house to their kids (me and my cousins) or anyone who will listen. he had no respect for anyone not even my grandma ‘his mom’ I’ve seen random people come to the house asking for names I’ve never heard of, turns out he’s selling things he finds in the back yard (my grandma is a bit of a horder) just to buy weed with the little bit of money he can make. He also has a different girl over every night has always been a man whore and I think he came in my room one night while my friends were sleeping over and stole one of my friends card information either that or he found her wallet and took down her information. I went outside one day and saw a go puff order with my friends name on it, she said she never sent anything to my house. She keeps getting random charges on her card. Inside the bag was condoms and strawberries. I never confronted and he never asked me about it tho but nothing can explain his name on some of the random charges other than that. Sometimes things would go missing like every one of my lighters, my drinks, my friends school ring she accidentally left in the bathroom (never found), and one time my cousins friend left his rollex in the bathroom after a shower and the friend found my uncle in the living room taking pictures with it.
He became very questionable to me i stopped trusting him to be honest. He’s been taking my things tho I never get really bothered by it, I bought little coffee a table from a thrift and it disappeared after a couple of months and it was in the garage, he needed it more than me tho…
So here is the current story my last straw i would love advice cuz i don’t know what to do and im honestly so emotional. 
Keep in mind i am a collector so i have way to many clothes, trinkets and stuffed animals but im also an artist so i have art stuff that cost a lot and i love vintage things so i have things like that too.
A couple of months ago i got pregnant and moved out the family house and into a studio with my fiancé. For the weeks i was out the house i was going back and forth to Check up on my cats and my stuff. my little cousin decided he wanted my room. I had no problem with this as long as my stuff was ok. Every day that I came back things looked more cluttered and shoved around. But I had no truck or time or money to get my things. So stupidly i procrastinated getting my stuff. My grandma and my little cousin (who was staying in my room) ended up getting into an argument after she asked him to help her get something out her car and he said “nah im tired”, he also wasn’t going to school, or paying rent, and the room was a mess, so instead of kicking him out or making him clean up she cleaned up after him, (she told him she would rent out the room unless he went to school or started paying rent) I called her when I heard about it, (cuz now my things would have to be moved) I told her my stuff is in there and I’ll come get them soon, she said not to worry about it, that i don’t need to worry that she would help me pack it and keep everything safely stored in the house. Ofc that didn’t happen I went to check on my things meanwhile it had only been a couple of weeks since i moved and days since she said my not to worry about my things, and so many things were missing i had not yet realized things were thrown out like my vintage vanity and a art set worth $100. My mom said she saw my grandma put some of my things in her car and tried her best to take them out. So i urgently take the boxes home regretting trusting my grandma. A couple days later i go to my grandma’s apartment and she literally has my vintage glass figurines on her shelves and little things from my room around and i end up stealing them back from her, (I don’t like confrontation) thankfully she also took my laundry basket and a duffle bag of mine so it wasn’t to hard to collect my things and go. Anyway I still had bags of clothes and stuffed animals and art things at the family house so I keep going back when I can to neatly put stuff together and grab what I can fit into the car. Also my new place is 30 minutes away and my fiancé works many hours and I’m pregnant so it isn’t easy to go back and forth. It’s also really dirty at the family house and have dust allergies and nobody cares about the cats so the kittens that happen to be born randomly all have eye infections and my pregnant self is cleaning after them all at the same time. I slowly got over that situation after it kept me up at night. I went through a bit of a morning/grief after losing so many things.
I’m gonna get on with my the toxic uncle story so my mom helps me neatly place the rest of my things and we put my clothes and stuffed animals in boxes on the porch I thought they’d be safe since I’d be back for them to wash them when I could, I didn’t think they’d do that to me again and throw more of my little life aways but my uncle did he wanted to be petty since my grandma refurbished the garage and the family agreed my mom would move into it since she was paying the most rent anyways. This left my uncle homeless maybe 2 days and one night while my mom moved her stuff out her room. (She did it all by herself moving her whole life. She did it very fast considering her health problems. My uncle and my mom have been in a silent feud for year’s now and so he for sure wasn’t gonna help her. And I couldn’t do much since I was like 6 months pregnant) So yeah he has no right to bully my mother, I’m guessing out of anger he’s been moving her outside storage boxes in the rain like old photo albums and things like that. He fucked up tho cuz I think he thought the boxes on the porch were just my moms but they were mine too and the other day he put them in bulk. So devastatingly my last bit of clothes and my had to be hundreds of dollars of squishmallos and my childhood plushies gone. Just gone. Plus some of it was my mom’s laundry like sheets and rugs. He claims “he thought it was all trash” which is lies since there’s is actual trash all around the house. Anywho I’m just a girl and I want revenge but i actually think he might hurt me but like I wanna flood his room with the hose or convince the family to actually get him kicked out but I don’t wanna be like him. I keep telling myself karma is coming but my tears won’t replace my stuffiessss. I may just ask him to pay me back for them and document everything and sue him when I have the money idk… help. I just want to feel better I really want my plushies too🤧

In a city where manners are as rare as a parking spot, I'm the champion of social etiquette – aka The Slap Whisperer, defender of street decency and scourge of the despicable. I prowl the streets day and night, seeking out social transgressions that demand my expert intervention. Countless hours of industrial refinement have yielded a slap of calculated precision, punctuated by a crisp, satisfying pop, sounding like a report from a .22 caliber pistol, the sound waves raging through the air. The momentum and magnitude expertly calibrated to execute my corrective measures with flawless efficacy, the comforting warmth on my palm signifying justice served.

Using the cheek as my canvas, I leave my explosive signature in the form of a beet red, swollen impression - matching either the contours of my knuckles from a perfectly executed backhand, or mirroring the fleshy outline of my palm from a classic, straightforward slap. I painted a red hill on the cheek with a delicate, artistic brushstroke of rebuke. I employ an arsenal of varying maneuvers, each tailored to a specific intensity, to serve the thenar eminence of my palm to the infractor's deserving cheek with a resounding, uninhibited smack that sends an electric jolt to my elbow.

For the most egregious transgressors, I reserve the powerful, backhanded, and notoriously feared bitch slap, guiding the knuckle ridge on the dorsal surface with calculated precision to the most deserving cheekbones. Releasing the sweet aroma of blunt force trauma, an amplification of my signature red hill. A round, dark blue bruise erupts as if a plum grew on the cheek, its tender skin now swollen and inflamed. The loud impact like a detonated brick of C4 that left the perpetrating cheek trembling in fear.

**Public Display of Affection (PDA): Front slap with MODERATE intensity.**

A soul-crushing trudge along the Central Park traverse road morphed into an unexpected opportunity to unleash my twitchy slapping hand when I chanced upon an oblivious young couple devouring each other's lips on the corner of the street. Their lip-locked bag of bones formed an obstacle, a human roadblock, as pedestrians crossing the street flowed around them like a school of fish parting to avoid a submerged fishing net.

The couple's blatant disregard for crossing protocols, combined with their cringe-inducing public display of affection, ignited my slapping hand, which now thrummed with a scorching, molten heat, like the fiery hue of a solar flare. My hand spasmed with eager, destructive intent, as if possessed by a malevolent spirit ravenous for release. Unfurling my arm, a whipcord of righteous indignation, loosening my arm with a few preparatory windups, and slapped the slobbering, offending couple tongue-wrestling like a pair of drunken octopuses.

Slap! A crisp report that echoed off the horse carriages filled with tourists. The sound wave rippled through the air, leaving a faint hum of satisfaction in its wake. Palm of my slapping appendage landed on one cheek with extended fingers striking the second cheek. A slap aimed at two conjoined kissers requires a full arm extension with momentum starting at the shoulder. Couple's lips disengaged with a sloppy, startled smack, their faces frozen in a tableau of shock, humiliation, and cowardly outrage.

""Move on!,"" I instructed the red-cheeked couple, my palm and finger imprints on their respective cheeks a lingering testament to their transgression. As they walked off, hand in hand, they tenderly rubbed their throbbing, chastised cheek. Infraction corrected.

**Aggressively Assistive: Front slap with SEVERE intensity**

Inside the mid-town electronic store, the hum of fluorescent lights and the whiny voices of haggling customers filled the air as I browsed for a backup drive, my vigilance and dedication to correcting social transgressions remaining on high alert. Hand twitchy, ready. Exchanging greetings with the electronics consultant, he was swiftly dismissed. Two drives were set apart for comparison. Decision made. Lurking consultant returned, spitting unsolicited product data. ""Assistance not required"" was offered to inattentive ears.

He returned, mouthing unsolicited specs, details of product origin, tracing the item to Guangzhou Asia-Pacific Distribution Hub (GADH). My hand stirred, awakening from its slumber like a burgeoning beast, its muscles quivering with anticipation, as he left and returned with a folder containing: Commercial Invoice, Packing List, Bill of Lading, Certificate of Origin, Export Declaration, Import Declaration, Delivery Order, Warehouse Receipt, Stock Receipt, and Point of Sale Receipt, each document a fresh provocation, fueling my growing ire.

The slapping hand spasmed like a decapitated chicken and shook violently, steam hissing from pores. One. Final. Paperwork. Detail. Too. Much. Bypassing the windup. Slap! The flaming hand, beating with discontent connected with a loud thud, more palm than fingers striking the unexpecting cheek. An unearthly silence buzzed throughout the store. The fool's eyes bulged like telescope goldfish, his face transformed into a deep, fiery crimson, as if a master painter had meticulously crafted a handprint on his deserving cheek, complete with intricate, swelling brushstrokes.

Papers slipped from his grasp, drifting lazily to the floor. Consultant befittingly paralyzed with disbelief, eyes wide with fear and shame, was twice offered ""Assistance not required"" to very attentive ears. He retrieved his documents and humbly dispersed. Infraction corrected.

**Humblebragging: Backhand Bitch Slap with EXTREME intensity**

My slapping hand still reverberating from the earlier adrenaline rush, I walked to the Starbuck's over on the next block to imbibe a soothing cup of overpriced caffeine. I sat at a rear table, sipping my scalding coffee near a young couple, likely professional colleagues, seated across from me. Unfortunately, they were close enough to disrupt solitary sustenance.

I massaged my still-twitching slapping hand, congratulating it on a job well done. The young man boasted about turning down Kopi Luwak coffee, saying it was too pricey, but then proudly admitted to buying a cup. He launched into a pretentious soliloquy about the 'notes' and 'undertones' of his ridiculously overpriced ass-coffee, comparing it to a fine wine and using terms like 'earthy', 'mocha', and ' hints of citrus'. He smugly elaborated that Kopi Luwak is made from coffee beans digested and sh\_t out by Asian palm civets, and then painstakingly extracted from their feces by humans.

[Asian Palm Civet, The Coffeemaker](https://preview.redd.it/83j91lmvqjbe1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c71b1fa3a1a0b77c5c674aa07f89b88533749867)

Apparently, the luxury coffee experience involves shattering the rectal innocence of palm civets, forced to endure rectal excavation for the sake of our caffeine fix. The poor palm civet's dignity forever systematically dismantled! Then it occurred to me – this fool was humblebragging! This was the ultimate offense, deserving of my signature move: the powerful, backhanded, and notoriously feared bitch slap. Fury rebooted my hand's adrenaline surge, igniting lethal tremors.

I strode over to their table, greeting the young woman with a gracious smile. My gaze locked onto the young man, waiting for him to make eye contact. My slapping hand rested on my left shoulder, arm bent at the elbow, poised for launch. My bicep bulged with tension, coiled and ready to unleash its fury. The air seemed to vibrate with anticipation. Whop! Slap! The backhanded bitch slap connected with a loud crack, knuckles protruding like walnuts.

The impact exploded squarely on the cheekbone, sending the young man's humble-bragging grin disintegrating along with his cheek. His head snapped back, eyes rolling heavenward as he slumped in his seat, stunned. The windows in the store rattled in harmony, as if applauding the correction. The young woman, with a mischievous glint in her eye and a subtle smile playing on her lips, seemed to savor the moment. She winked, as if to say, ""Thank you, kind stranger."" I smiled, feeling the warmth of my spent hand, and walked away, satisfied. Infraction corrected.

My bitch slap is a masterclass in humility recalibration, leaving a lasting impression – and a nasty, baseball-sized hematoma – on the offender.

1hvn72d,https://i.redd.it/xg4a9uvbbjbe1.jpeg,Is German Lavazza really bottom of the barrel?,"The first coffee I made in my moka pot was a bag of whole bean Lavazza Espresso. It was HORRIBLE. So horrible, that I ran to reddit asking if it was supposed to be that burnt and bitter-tasting. I thought I would never try Lavazza again, but I spotted this block of preground Crema e Gusto at the local italian supermarket and grabbed it out of curiosity.

And... it's good? Really good! I'm not gonna say it's the best coffee ever, but the Lavazza Dolce is even less bitter than the 80% arabica 20% robusta blend I was grinding at home. I actually prefer the mildness of the Lavazza. With water and a little milk, it's just a darn good cup of coffee, with a surprising amount of sweetness to it. I didn't feel compelled to add any honey at all, even though I usually do! It has also been enlightening to see how finely ground it is (finer than I was grinding my beans).

So that makes me think... is it true that Germany gets bad Lavazza? Or was it just that the Lavazza Espresso wasn't to my liking? In any case, my opinion of Lavazza has been rectified! No wonder it's the most popular coffee in Italy.

I’m financially independent, have my own business, and don’t need a job while I’m there – my main focus is to enjoy the experience, learn, and connect with amazing people.

That said, I do have a few questions and concerns, and I’d love some advice from the locals or anyone who’s been in a similar situation:

1.	Is socializing and making friends difficult in Barcelona, especially during a Master’s program?

2.	If I end up spending a lot of time alone, can Barcelona feel depressing? 

3.	Can I find a decent room to rent for around €500? I know Barcelona can be pricey, so I’d appreciate tips on areas to look into or how to find good deals.

4.	My biggest concern is making good friends. Any advice on how to connect with people in Barcelona?

I've been using a coffee I know well for months now without issue, getting 35-40g out in around 32s from 17g coffee in. I'm used to extraction starting slow at around 8s then the flow rate increasing, it gives a great espresso for drinking straight or making a milk drink.

1hvmy8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1hvmy8f/why_is_it_so_hard_to_leave_long_yap_skim_through/,Why is it so hard to leave ? Long yap skim through or skip its very long for a Reddit post sorry ,"Everyone I have mentioned my situation to has said nothing but to leave /that he is not good for me. But why can't I see that for myself ? If someone told me that even a fraction of what he's done to me so far was happening to them, I'd feel so bad and want them to leave and be safe. But I don't know if it's because I think I have control over how far this will go, because I told some people that I want to give him a chance and the first big major red flag Id leave. But what would that even be ? He's already accidentally, or so I hope hurting me. One of the most recent ones was of course when we were okay wrestling/tickling each other, he was pinning me down which isn't the issue because that part is just play that we've both done to each other, but he squeezed really hard this time and on my left arm it did leave a bruise, and I wouldn't have thought anything of it had he not asked if my arm bruised easily and if it left a bruise, but the moment wasn't intense or dangerous, because again it's okay fighting right? And he accidentally went a little to far right? So at what point is enough enough, will I only leave if when he hurts me and he doesn't say it was an accident or we were just playing around? Will I just let him do whatever because ""it's okay we're just messing around""? Yet I've never gone to far to actually inflict harm while play fighting. But also while play fighting, he's said like ""oh you're scared"" and I told him I wasn't and then when that happens he goes in for a fake punch and is like ""ha you're scared you flinched"" and I just tell him I'm still not. And then one of the times when I was telling him how I wasn't scared and joking that I could beat him up, he would push me while I was sitting on his bed, not lightly either, but not hard enough it's leave anything, but I can't register it as harm by him because it happens while we're playing around or he's smiling while doing it so I assume he's just being playful. Not too long ago when we were at my house and I was on the edge of the bed, again we were joking around with each other verbally and he shoved my with his hand, and I almost fell but he caught me. That was the only time I was actually scared while he was being playfully physical. And the way he reacted didn't seem like he cared to much he moved on from almost pushing me off the bed to the floor very nonchalantly, before when he'd accidentally do something he'd profusely apologize, and now he says sorry still but not the same as he did in the beggining, and he doesn't mind what he did, like you can tell he doesn't feel bad, he just doesn't want me to have a reason to be upset at that action. I hope they're accidents, but they keep happening, and compared to the amount of times he's had to apologize to me is scary to me, because me it's genuinely been accidentlal, like when you turn around too fast and didn't see someone behind you so you accidentally bump in to them a bit, that's the accidental hurt that I would do to him and be very cautious to not do again, but with him it seems that these accidents won't stop, and he's not putting in the effort to make sure it doesn't happen again after he apologizes. I'm scared because what if he is dangerous and then does end up killing me, like he's joked. He seems so kind and is and is generous, but he also lies to me a lot, but then assumes I'm a liar. Like how he's continuously thought I was wanting/talking to someone else, when literally one of the nights when he was saying the killing jokes, and the I hate you thing jokingly, I saw a bumble notification on his phone which I ignored because I thought he just forgot to delete his account, so I didn't mention it to him and then weeks later now, I told him I had to move to Canada because at the time I thought that was my only option given my home situation rn with my abusive mother and her boyfriend. So I told him we should break things off so it's easier for me, but he still wanted me to stay in touch with him and be apart of his life he said, as in I shouldn't block him, and he also said how he'll miss me and never find anyone like me and is down with dating after me, which I immediatley called bs on, because why even bother lying and saying that? Anyways so like a day or two after that I decided to test if he was being honest or if I was right to call him a liar. So I made a catfish account on bumble and then an account with my photos and name, the catfish account was to see if he actually wasn't able to date anymore, and then my account was there because I knew if I was on the app, I'd know if he was swiping on it and moving on, because then he'd call me out for having the account and question me, which sure enough he fell for both and matched with the fake account and sent an opening question, which is important for later, anyways then he messaged me with a sc of my real account that I made that day and said ""really are you really serious ?"" And he called me a liar and said I knew you were lying. And that yes we neeeded to call after he smoked some weed, which we were supposed to call anyways and I was going to tell him I might likely not have to move back to canada. Anyways so that broke my heart because it had meant he had lied and after within the same day I got him currency for his game as a surprise which he saw, he then went onto a fricking dating app! So when we're finally on call he knew he was in trouble, and I explained to him how I caught him and he has no reason to be mad and most of the time he had nothing to say, and just kept like sighing like he didn't know what else to do. But when I confronted him about being on the app he said he only downloaded it today which was obviously a lie based on the notification I saw perviously, so he lied and in that moment I told him I cannot forgive him or move on if he doesn't just be honest with me, and he swore he wasn't lying and that he wouldn't lie mind you this is all in the same call, so I told him about how I knew he was lying and had the app the who time, and then again he got silent, and then he said oh well sorry I just forgot I had it and just kept lying to me about not matching with anyone and not saying anything to anyone, and he told me lie after lie and with each lie I gave him proof of how he was lying straight to me, and after each time I caught his lie and told him I just need honesty he said he wouldn't lie again and he was sorry and then would lie again, and I told him there's no point in lying to make the situation look better than what it is because I already knew the truth. And I kept asking why I want enough and he said I was, but couldn't explain why he'd keep the app, and he kept changing his answers to things I'd ask but he said it's because I blocked him and he wasn't sure I was sure about him and about how he's been hurt in the past, even though he knows I've been cheated on and don't get intimate with ppl but decided to with him. And during the conversation he tried turning things on to me, and then only when I told him I cannot forgive or move on if he's not honest and stuff, then he apologized and would say he was wrong for it, but he would word it in a way where it didn't sound as bad and each time I corrected him and told him not to diminish the hurt he's caused to me, and he said he only is doing that because he doesn't want  me to think he's that kind of guy or a bad guy, which like wtf. But anyways he just kept apologizing saying he wants a chance to make it up to me and couldn't really give me an answer on why I should give him another chance, and that he wants to see me in person, and I just asked when he was coming to pick up his stuff, and he told me don't be like that, that he just needs to be able to show me in person that he's gonna do better and prove to me this and that. I eventually did agree that I would give him one and only chance, and told him if he cannot meet my relationship standards to show me he cares and respects me enough to let me move on and that if he cane be the person I need and deserve that we can hang out. I will show some texts as well, but yeah after he told me he'd lose respect for me and feel disrespected if I hung with another guy one on one even as a friend that he wouldn't be able to look at me the same and stuff. But then he goes and leaves windows open for other girls in case we fail. It's funny how he's felt the need to grab my phone so much and call me sneaky when every time he checks over my shoulder who I'm texting I let him see, the only things I don't let him see are my photos and my Reddit and TikTok likes, which he thinks is me being sneaky but I just need some privacy, it's not that I'm talking to other people even! And whenever I randomly come to look at his phone with him because he does it to me always so I assumed it was okay if I like watch like TikTok with him or YouTube or whatever, but when ever I go to. He either shuts his phone off or switches tabs immediatley, idk if he's trying to make me feel insecure and jealous, becaus he thinks I am being sneaky, but I know for a fact he doesn't have anyone else, the only time he accepted the fake bumble accounts and was active on there was when he thought I was moving, so I will give him that, but then why is he acting like he has something to hide, when I know for a fact he doesn't, like I find it repulsing to think that I'd need his password to be able to check his phone instead of us just innocently sharing passwords with each other for reasons not to do with checking each others phones, but I'm afraid I might have to make that a temporary condition if he truly wants another chance, but that brings me back to my question when will enough be enough, I told him this is his one and only chance and I won't ever beg him to treat me right again, but what happens when he tries to say he won't do whatever it is again, like will I really be done? I don't want to be done when it's too late. I can't identify him as an abuser because I feel like I would be unfair and overreacting to his jokes and playful fighting. Also he had an ex of a year and no one has reached out to me so naturally I assumed if he hasn't been abusive to his ex as far as I know, then why would he suddenly be that with me. It's especially hard because from what I've read he doesn't at least I feel like fits the criteria of an abuser, he said he's not a controlling guy or trying to come off controlling when he asked me not to hang out with a potential guy friend at the mall, which I had no problem respecting, but he says he's not controlling so of course I can't believe against that. But like him grabbing my phone out my hands a lot wether it's to turn it off so I'm not on it and in the moment with him, or so he can like look at stuff, he hasn't from what I known gone through my chats, and even though I never mentioned being worried about it he reassured me he doesn't care and doesn't want to check my phone, but like he keeps invading my privacy on my phone, like he knows I dont want him liking through my drafts or likes because for one it's embarrassing and for two I like videos that have to do with identifying abusers and I don't want him to see and get mad and assume I think that of him, but even though I told him I wasn't okay with it everytime I'm on TikTok and he grabs my phone, he goes to do that, and then I have to physically, try to get my phone out of his hand in crazy ways. He's again smiling and acting like it's all a good old time when he does this, but then like when I told him I'll let him see like certain ones, he just said forget it because I was obviously just going to get rid of the ones I want to hide and stuff and that I shouldn't even bother showing him at that point, and he does that like a few times not frequently but that kind of behaviour is frequent, I am starting to fear him and I get this sinking feeling when I think about how he might be dangerous, but I do trust him enough to listen to him and believe what he says, besides certain things especially now, but like if he says he did it on accident like I have no other reason to believe it wasn't an accident. But I am so conflicted, he is very nice but then when he starts to scare me a little or do those things that might be concerning it's hard to ignore. I know that when we see each other again he's going to act right and not do any of that bullshit since I told him I'd give him the chance, but how long will that last? Like when I asked him not to say I hate you or accuse me of things I didn't do he after a few days started it up again, also I'm just a little scared and I know I don't have a legit reason to be but I am admittidely a bit fearful that physically it will get worse, but idk because he's so confusing, he's seems to care when he hurts me sometimes, or maybe he's just trying to convince me he cares so I don't run or say anything idk, only he knows really. But then there are moments where he just shows he doesn't care that he might or has hurt me. Also I feel bad and I agree it's my fault but I'm also a little concerned he might be blaming me for what he does wrong, like for example I was holding his like pipe bowl thingy and taking a hit and he pulled out the like part where you put the flower, and he grabbed the wrong part completely but I moved a little too much while holding it so he ended up burning his finger and blaming me, which I know it's my fault, but I feel he exaggerated it to make me feel like really bad which I already did, but he even though it was a surface burn and was completely fine expect the skin was a little damaged, was saying even 20 minutes after the fact that it still burned and I feel bad still about it, but I've worked in a coffee shop and have cooked since I was little so I have had my fair share of burns and with how his looked it didn't seem like it's hurt past 5 minutes expect maybe if even at that if you put pressure on it, then it might hurt, but he had his water cup with ice and kept looking back at me bfore dipping his finger in there to let me know it was still hurting, even though he was still able to play his video game, so that just confused me, but I know I'm in the wrong there and don't want to try to like sound like I'm playing victim, I just found it a little off. One thing though that is on him that I don't like or do to him is get upset back in defence when he is upset with me over something, instead I try to ask what's wrong so I can fix it, but when I have an issue like when he was making the I hate you jokes and stuff I didn't like I would jokingly give him attitude about to like tease him a bit about what he's done, because I try to be the person that you can look back after and laugh and make jokes which he does but when I did/do it he just tells me to stop before he catches an attitude and gets upset, or that I'm adding to his stress, even though I'm dealing with so much more than him, he just has to deal with odd work times and some errands for people, like his dad or grandma. To be fair though he only really complains if it's in the morning that he has to do stuff which I don't understand sometimes because the very few things or simple things he has to do are usually around 11-12 or later, only if it's work and even sometimes not even that is it like earlier, which he wakes up even before me sometimes and wakes up at a good time but just lays to you know prepare to be up and start his day, so idk why he acts like he hates mornings and that the only reason he complains. But I think he just likes me to feel worse for him than what it really is, and I only feel that way because of a few patterns. Idk though he said he's not going to lie to me again and be super honest, but I fear his pattern is lying or exaggerating things. I don't want to have to change him I told him that, he either is the person for me or he's not and needs to let me be and not waste my time. All this I have to say about him but it's still not an idea in my own head to leave. Why is it genuinely so hard to leave and convince myself it's not good? (Also fyi the photos of the text are after I told him on call to give me a second to consult someone if I should give him another chance)

We are very different people but we gravitated toward each other right away. When things are good, they're very good, but we have a difficult time communicating about uncomfortable things. 

Case in point, this weekend, we were getting physically intimate and I briefly stopped us to say I didn't enjoy something he was doing. His immediate response was, ""What? But I do!"" which then put me in a position where I felt like I had to defend my preference. I explained that it just didn't feel good for me and he related it to some past trauma that I had in an early relationship that was abusive. We got past that discussion in a few minutes and came up with a compromise that we both liked then resumed our activities. The next day, I was a bit perturbed by how he initially responded to the situation and decided I wanted to bring it up when I saw him later.

When I saw him, we first had a brief miscommunication about where we were meeting up. He didn't see my text message telling him I got us both coffee and so I waited for him and drank mine alone. He finally found me after about 15 minutes and apologized for not seeing my text earlier. He already got himself a coffee and drank his before seeing me. Although I was a little irritated, I told him I was fine (I was). He responded that I didn't sound fine and I reassured him again that it was a little irritating but it's all good now and I gave him a kiss. He continued to insist that I was not fine and said I was being ""hostile"" toward him. I was completely beside myself because I had literally just told him I was okay twice AND kissed him to let him see that everything is okay. I kept asking him how I was being hostile and he couldn't really give me a good answer aside from ""your tone."" Eventually, he conceded that he's just bad at reading my emotions and I asked him to please believe me when I'm telling him and showing him that things are alright.

We arrived at a good resolution point on the above issue. He came to sit next to me and he put his arm around me. The conversation from the prior night was still weighing on me, so I told him something like, ""Hey, I have one more small thing I'd like to address while we're talking. It's not a big deal, but it has been bothering me a bit and I'm hoping you can help me through it."" Then, I tell him that his initial response to me expressing a dislike was to tell me he liked it and that made me feel like my needs and pleasure are unimportant. I told him I know it was not his intention to make me feel like that and that I appreciate the compromise we made. I just wanted to bring it to his attention because it did hurt in the moment and I'm hoping that if this happens in the future, he can just say something like, ""Thank you for letting me know--of course we don't have to do anything you're not comfortable with"" and that can be the end of that. 

He then kind of gave me a robotic apology and sat there with this look on his face where I could tell something was wrong. I told him it looked like something was bothering him and he said he's just sad that we keep fighting over stupid stuff. I had not seen any of this discussion as a fight and let him know I was just trying to be honest about my feelings. I told him I think he is a wonderful person and I know he's not trying to hurt me, but that sometimes, these things happen. Anytime we have a conversation about hurt feelings isn't an attack and doesn't need to be an argument. It can just be an opportunity for us to learn more about being better partners for each other. At least, that's how I see it. A few days prior to this, he brought up something I did that hurt his feelings. I listened, apologized, told him what I'd do better in the future, and thanked him for sharing with me. I don't know why every single time I express some minor hurt, he takes it as a personal attack no matter how nicely I approach him. These conversations get totally derailed and end with me having to triage his feelings.

How do I handle this? I've tried using a super soft tone, touching his arm or holding his hand, prefacing what I say with things like ""I know you have good intentions"" or ""I'm hoping you can help me through this"" but he still seems to always see my expression of hurt feelings as an attack from which he has to defend himself. I don't want to get to a point where I stop telling him these things and shove the feelings away but it seems like what I'm doing isn't working. Any advice on how to approach him so he doesn't automatically think we're fighting?",2,1736238274.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False
