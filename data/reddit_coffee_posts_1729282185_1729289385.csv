I searched the sub but it seems like most people have the opposite issue: I noticed that I get nauseous from warm liquids! I never liked them and in hindsight I think this might be the reason why. I get nauseous from tea or warm coffee, while iced coffee is fine. I just made some pudding and just ate a spoon of it warm > nauseated. I can eat it just fine once it's cooled down.

is anybody else the same? I tolerate water and juices and stuff way better when it's iced, even warm it often makes me nauseated.

anybody else? and any idea why? it seems like many people here think that warm liquids help with digestion, but I generally prefer my meals cold. I'll have to observe if I can tolerate solid food cold better than warm, but I think I might be.",2,1729289193.0,Gastroparesis,1,1.0,False

In my old city, I met a guy this summer, he got me into a festival, we made out, went to his place and a couple of weeks later agreed to be friends with benefits. We both knew I would move in fall. We had a conversation a bit before I moved about what's going to happen then, as the new city is 4 hours away from the old city. He stated he would like to keep what we had going, and I said we could see how it'd go.

I do have a hard time saying no and I did enjoy the first couple of weeks a lot - but he got more and more needy, texted me good morning messages and kept me updated about his entire day - so I talked to him about having difficulties when it comes to commitment and that his constant texting was too much for me. He listened and was thankful for my communication and told me he'd change that.

So the good morning texts stopped (thankfully), but we kept seeing each other quite a lot as we lived nearby. The sex was good in the beginning, but pretty soon, it felt like he was just checking a box with foreplay to get to the ""main act"". I was in pain sometimes and usually told him that it was starting to be painful as I wasn't that horny anymore but that he could kept going until finishing (encouraging him to stop holding back). So, for me, the benefits part started to become a bit dreadful - the start was usually nice, but always ended up being painful due to too much friction and lack of lubrication.

¬†

There were a couple of reasons why I did not want to end the situation. For once, I did want to keep him around until my move - which was a terrible decision in all the ways as his mood on the day of my move was terrible, making everyone (four women) feel uncomfortable. For example, he was angry at me for not having a Coke (Coca Cola, not cocaine) there for him - I forgot he didn't drink coffee. I offered him Iced Tea (""okay then I'll take that"") - unfortunately, that was almost empty so he angrily went down to the store (in the same building) to get a coke.

He told me he was exhausted because it was his tenth (not sure about the exact number, but a lot) move this past month as an explanation for his irritability. We each had to walk only 2-3 times until we had it all in the car, everyone said that was the easiest move they had ever been at, as a lot of my stuff had already been taken by my dad. To be fair: when my dad was there, the guy had also helped me carry my stuff outside, in a less annoyed mood.

So that was the one reason why I wanted to keep him around: I was afraid of no one having time at the move as a lot of my other friends had to work.

But I also enjoyed having someone to snuggle with and to sit outside with and enjoy my last summer in the old city with.

The third reason: I was interested in seeing what would happen, as he's a nice guy. He tries hard and he had quite the difficult childhood and I wanted to give him a chance to see where things would take us. He had an immense need to share every step he took, but when I wanted to talk about something that bothered me, he was able to listen and he was thankful for me telling him (e.g. I told him I felt uncomfortable with pda and he actually listened and told me about his point of view and agreed that if it made me uncomfortable, then he'd refrain from taking my hand in public. It was a very small city, so everyone knew everyone and I didn't want to have to tell people that he was not my boyfriend.) So even though I didn't have romantic feelings for him in the start, I wanted to see if something could develop.

I made clear from the beginning that I had no romantic feelings and was only up for a friends with benefits situation. Very clear, as there had been misunderstandings in the past, so we had more than one occasions where I very bluntly told him that I only wanted this and if I found someone new in the new city, I would want to end our situation. In the beginning, he had said he felt the same, just wanted to see where things would go. Towards the end, I felt him hesitating a bit more and last week, we were on the phone and I told him I'd like to take the benefits out of the equation and just be friends again. (This has worked the other way round for another guy and me in the past; he ended it, I wouldn't have minded it to keep on going, but we're still good friends.)

This is where it starts to get complicated. I told him on the phone that I wanted to go back to being just friends, referring to those past conversations where I had already told him this could be the case once I moved. He was not happy - when he asked how came, I said I just hadn't thought about it as much and thought it best to end. Which is true; I hadn't missed him at all, so after talking to my brother, I decided to rip it off like a band-aid. He was quite hurt, which he just told me - and I get that. I refrained from telling him about the sex feeling less about sex and more about getting to the P in V and from telling him how he annoyed me the past couple of weeks (in the new city already) with oversharing and complaining - I wanted to give him the space to just tell me about how he feels and making the explanation as short as possible (I just didn't think about it as much).

In hindsight, that was not the nicest phrasing. He texted me, a long text, a couple of days later where he told me about being hurt by me telling him how it didn't mean anything to me and how he wasn't important to me. Which I had never said. He texted that to me on my first day of University in the new city and the text itself upset me. I forgot/procrastinated to text him back for a couple of days - I do have some friendships where we text each other back after a couple of days/weeks, so that is not completely unusual for me. However, with this guy, I had usually texted him back quicker, the topics were not that intense as well before. Three days later he wrote a disappointed text, almost like a letter, stating his disappointment in me ghosting him and how shitty he felt and how he had expected more. I then texted him back - it was my first week-end with university already started, so I hadn't had time to go into this emotional state. I told him I had procrastinated and forgotten to answer. It goes on like this for a bit, with him texting me droplets of new things that angered him/made him sad and me replying the following day / a couple of hours later. I definitely did not like the way he talked to me, telling me what I should have done (spoken to him in another way when ending the benefits-part) and just dumping all his emotions onto me at any random time.

One of these times, he told me he didn't want an excuse, he just wanted to share his thoughts/feelings. That's something he had said multiple times - not expecting anything, just wanting to share, and it had always annoyed me, usually I just joked about it. This time, I told him that he couldn't expect me to just take that in without any reaction and how I wasn't his therapist or plushie.

We texted a bit more, and today, I called him after he tried to call me when I was in class, followed by a long message about how his phrasing had been wrong, what he actually meant was that he felt not respected because of my long reply time etc - so I called him and told him to tell me whatever he had to say. He said, there wasn't really much more he wanted to say. I asked him to just tell me he wanted to talk if he felt the need for that, so we could make a time, instead of just texting me all his emotions, which ripped me out of my daily life in the new city at the new University.

He did apologize for the way he communicated his feelings in the beginning. But I still am not sure what to make from the situation. As I wrote this, I started to think that maybe we're just not a good combination. He overcommunicates and keeps talking about his most benign feelings (I was a bit upset this morning because my pancake was ugly-type of benign) and I pull back the more desperately a person tries to get close to me. I know that and I try to work on it - I did tell him that commitment is difficult for me and I also told him on multiple occasions that he overshared and I felt bulldozed by the, you could call it trauma-dumping.

He is a nice person and tries hard - and I am very glad I ended the benefits-part. I will still see him in the future as he participates in an organization I co-founded and I, at no point, intended to hurt him. I think he started to develop more profound feelings for me towards the end, which was another urgent reason for me to end the situation. I just wonder what I could have done differently. I did want to have him around and we had some nice times - nightly walks, some good sex, cuddles, good talks.

Am I the asshole for not ending it earlier?

¬†

TLDR: My friend with benefits helped me move, I ended the benefits-part a couple of weeks after moving. He was upset about the phrasing and about me taking three days to reply to his upset text afterwards. I had wanted to keep him around until the move, I had told him I wasn't in for a relationship multiple times. I liked to have someone to cuddle and wasn't sure if I would still like to keep it going after moving a couple hours away. He is a heavy oversharer and some things already annoyed me beforehand.",1,1729288691.0,AITAH,1,0.67,False

1g6trki,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1g6trki/my_aa_meetings_are_getting_dark_part_1/,My AA meetings are getting dark (part 1),"Hey guys, first time poster here. To make a long story short I got into an accident while drunk, and got sentenced to 50 hours of AA and community service along with a hefty fine with a suspended license dangling off the side of this shit sundae. The minor details don‚Äôt matter for the context of this story so I won't speak on it. So yeah, it's a Friday night. Prime time for bar hopping but here I am sitting in an artificially lit room with bad coffee, and slightly worse company. Not to say that they were bad people, but why would we be compatible? I know, alcohol isn't all there is to life, and I agree with you. But this place is such a downer that I can't help but feel a little ill will. It's better than the county so I can't really complain that much. It's my first night though, maybe one or two of the folks will grow on me. 

‚ÄúI'd like to start off this meeting by addressing the new person in our group. Would you like to introduce yourself?‚Äù

He passes me this brightly colored stick with a feather tied to it with neon string.

‚ÄúUh the name is Mike, and I got court ordered to be here. I know I'm supposed to say I'm an alcoholic but honestly I just like drinking. I don't have a problem with it, I'm just here for my hours.‚Äù

I pass the stick back to the group leader

‚ÄúWell, thank you for sharing Mike, I just want to remind you that if you want those hours signed off you have to participate.‚Äù

I nod submissively 

‚ÄúAlright, who wants to go first?‚Äù

As the group trades experiences, and the talking stick amongst each other I see this woman walk in. She looks pretty from a distance, but when she gets closer you can tell that she's not keeping up with herself. Dirty clothes, a faint smell. She sits next to me since that was the only free chair there was. 

‚ÄúLet's take a moment to welcome the new face in the room, Brian can you pass the talking stick to her?‚Äù

Brian passes the talking stick to the mystery woman but she slowly extends her arm like she's hesitant about the mere act of speaking a word. Though she does take it after a moment. 

‚ÄúHi everyone my name is Evelyn, and I have a drinking problem.‚Äù 

Everyone murmurs a hi Evelyn, I parrot the crowd after a short delay. 

‚ÄúIt all started about two weeks ago. Before that I wouldn't even consider having a drink if it wasn't the weekend. I don't know what changed in me but I started having these intense migraines that for some reason only alcohol could soothe. It spiraled from there, and here I am horribly sober, and unsure if this is the right choice. The doctor said I'm fine, and everything checks out but I don't know.‚Äù

The group leader chimes up after motioning for the talking stick.

‚ÄúThank you for sharing Evelyn, and no, you made the right decision. Life is hard but alcohol only makes life that much harder.

‚ÄúWhat a load of crap.‚Äù I thought. The only thing that makes a bad day good is a cold beer.

‚ÄúWe go by the twelve step program here at AA Evelyn, are you familiar with it?‚Äù

She shakes her head

‚ÄúWell the first step to being alcohol free is to admit that we are powerless in our addiction. And the second step is to acknowledge there is a power that can restore us to sanity.‚Äù

Evelyn motions for the talking stick which The group leader handed happily.

‚Äúgive yourself over to a higher power?‚Äù

They pass the stick again. Talking stick? More like a passing stick. Jesus, this 50 hours of this is going to drive me insane. 

‚ÄúYes, it doesn't have to be a specific religion. Any belief will work.‚Äù

She closes her eyes in acknowledgement. He continues to say that they go by the buddy system. That means that everyone has one person in this group that they can rely on so that they're not going through the twelve steps alone. And wouldn't you guess it, everyone already has a buddy. So it would only be natural that I became Evelyn's buddy. Meeting ends, I get my first two hours signed off. I turn to the door, and when I get out I see Evelyn smoking a cigarette. She looks kinda happy. 

‚ÄúYou got another one of those?‚Äù

She hands me her pack, and I pull one out. I pull out a lighter and light it. I handed her pack back to her.

‚Äúthanks.‚Äù

I grunt as I exhale the smoke.

‚ÄúYou're welcome.‚Äù

We both stand there for a weird amount of time without talking. I break the silence.

‚ÄúSo, uh want my number? Since we're buddies now it'll just be easier.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

She hands me her phone and I put in my number. 

‚ÄúIt was my first night too.‚Äù

I mumbled out. The cold air stinging my lips as I breathe out to speak. 

‚ÄúIt was? Why are you here? By choice or‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got court ordered to. Two hours down forty eight to go.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds rough. Don't worry I'll make it easy for you.‚Äù

She smiles cutely. I blush slightly from her reply. 

‚ÄúDon't worry about it, I can handle it.‚Äù

With that I put out the cigarette with my boot, and I said goodbye. 

Now let's fast forward to the next week since nothing of real importance happened. She didn't call, or text besides one text about half a week in. She just said that the twelve step program was helping her. I'm glad that this program actually does help people who want to quit get over their dependency with alcohol. I go into the next week with a renewed sense of vigor. I have someone counting on me to get them where they need to be. I walk in about five minutes early, the usual suspects are walking in, some are getting what I'm assuming to be a cup of motor oil. I look around the room for Evelyn. And there I saw her, in the same seat she was in before. I walk up to sit down next to her.

‚ÄúHow ya doin‚Äô?‚Äù 

She turns around, and I see a different woman. Not physically, but there is this light in her eyes that wasn't there before. 

‚ÄúYeah I'm great! My migraines even went away!‚Äù

She says beaming ear to ear.

‚ÄúHey that's great Evelyn! I'm happy to hear that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can't wait for the third step!‚Äù

She says it in a frantic tone. I thought at the time that she was just extremely motivated for self improvement, but now I'm not so sure.

The group sits down, and the group leader holds out the talking stick. Its neon colors are an utter eyesore. 

‚Äúwho wants to start first?‚Äù

Evelyn perks her hand up first with alarming speed that only I seem to have noticed.

‚ÄúI would love to start.‚Äù

The group leader smiles and hands her the talking stick

‚ÄúI'm so happy to see you doing so much better Evelyn.‚Äù

Evelyn grabs the stick with both hands. Her knuckles are turning white.

‚ÄúHi Evelyn here, I've been sober for one week, and I have to be honest I've never felt better! I need to know what the third step is.‚Äù

She passes the stick to the group leader as quickly as her hands would allow. The group leader takes it without regard to those twitchy movements. Was he trying to be polite? 

‚ÄúThe third step is to give yourself over to that God, utterly and completely.‚Äù

She closes her eyes and smiles hard. I thought this was insane. How is everyone just accepting this without even a grimace?

The rest of the group goes on as normal, I barely got my hours in with how distracted I was from that whole thing. When it finished I tried to just head to the bus stop. When Evelyn shows up from around the corner.

‚ÄúHey buddy! Where ya goin‚Äô?‚Äù

I put on a facsimile of a smile even though I felt a growing unease with her presence. 

‚ÄúOh I'm heading to the bus stop to go home.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can drive you!‚Äù

She says with that same grin, that light I once saw turned into a glint of madness with the way she was bending and moving like she was doing ballet moves while getting ready to play a round of football.

‚ÄúN-No I'm fine. Thanks though.""

I'm ashamed to admit it as a six foot man that weighs 215 pounds but this petite woman is scaring me. And there was no way I was going to let that woman know where I live. 

‚ÄúAw, why not? I just wanna show my buddy how much I care about them.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I'm fine, I like the walk home. It's really nice out tonight.‚Äù 

The smile twitches for a moment as she holds her eye contact.

‚ÄúWell if you insist!‚Äù

She snaps back to being animated again. 

‚ÄúGet home safe buddy.‚Äù

This is where we're caught up with the story. The next meeting is in a couple of days, and Evelyne just messaged me that she's embraced the third step. I'm not sure if being free is worth it.

The sun blazed down on downtown Oakland, turning the October afternoon into something that felt more like midsummer. I sat at my usual table by the window in Tully‚Äôs Caf√©, a cozy spot on 15th Street where I‚Äôd been going for years to escape the chaos of the office. I had a tall black coffee in front of me, and I found myself staring out at the bustling streets without really seeing them. 



Today felt different, though I couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on why. I should‚Äôve been at the office, prepping for the big meeting at Brealco Foods. As CEO, my days were packed‚Äîone meeting after another, decisions about supply chains, marketing strategies, new product lines, and everything in between. We‚Äôd grown from a small startup into a major player in the organic foods market, and I‚Äôd been at the helm the entire time. People called me a visionary, a leader. But sitting there in the caf√©, with the sun creeping up the window, I didn‚Äôt feel like any of those things.I took a sip of my coffee. It was bitter, strong, just the way I liked it. But even the coffee couldn‚Äôt jolt me into the usual rhythm of my day. Normally, I thrived on pressure‚Äîmeetings, deadlines, decisions. I lived for it.



 But today, the thought of heading back to the office made me feel‚Ä¶ nothing. It was unsettling.



My phone buzzed on the table, vibrating across the surface as if it was trying to drag me back to reality. Another meeting. My team would be expecting me soon, waiting for me to review the final quarter projections and discuss next year‚Äôs expansion plans. I reached for the phone, but then something strange happened.¬†I stopped.¬†My hand hovered over the phone, but I didn‚Äôt pick it up. Instead, I pulled back and leaned into my chair. I took another slow sip of coffee, staring at the steam rising from the cup. In that moment, the world seemed to go quiet. The noise from the streets, the chatter from the other caf√© patrons, even the buzz of my phone‚Äîit all faded away. And for the first time in a long time,



 I felt still.A thought surfaced, clear and sharp: \*What am I doing all this for?\*I had always been so driven, so focused on building something, on achieving success. But what did success even mean anymore? Sure, Brealco was thriving, and my name was well-known in business circles. But what was I getting out of it? Did I even enjoy it anymore?I thought back to the late nights at the office, the endless travel, the stress that gnawed at me constantly. I‚Äôd spent so much time chasing the next big thing, but had I ever really stopped to enjoy what I‚Äôd built? Or had I gotten so caught up in the game that I‚Äôd forgotten why I started in the first place?I sat there, staring at the untouched second half of my coffee, and the realization hit me like a ton of bricks. I didn‚Äôt need to keep pushing. I didn‚Äôt have to constantly chase after more. Maybe it was okay to slow down, to take a step back and actually live for once, instead of just existing in the whirlwind of business and ambition.



My phone buzzed again. Another reminder.I smiled, shaking my head. For the first time in years, I didn‚Äôt feel the need to answer it. I reached out and silenced the phone, sliding it back into my bag. Then, with the sun warming my face, I leaned back and took a deep breath.¬†I wasn‚Äôt sure what came next.

1g6terr,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1g6terr/scales_of_power_feedback/,Scales of Power (Feedback),"Chapter 2:

At the break of dawn, Justin slowly emerged from his sleep, the dim light filtering through the window allowing his eyes to adjust gradually. Reaching over to the quaint bookshelf at the foot of his bed, he retrieved his phone to check the time.

""Roxi, it's already six. Time to rise,"" he called out, nudging the figure on his left.

A muffled groan of resistance met his ears. ""Let me rewind time for a moment,"" Roxi murmured sleepily.

""No, you've already done that tonight. Come on, get up,"" Justin insisted.

""Such a commander,"" Roxi teased.

""You know that's not true,"" Justin retorted with a smile.

She leaned over and planted a kiss on his cheek. ""Yes, baby.""

Together, they began to prepare for the day. Justin opted for a simple ensemble - a crisp blue shirt paired with black trousers and a matching tie. He chose a charcoal, dirtied blazer that he had forgotten to wash the night before. He thought about asking Roxi to rewind time but opted not to as he barely wore the blazer through the day anyway


Roxi wore a brown dress with golden clocks on it, all showing various times on them, and all seemingly moving as she did. Similarly coloured golden shoes with Roman numerals implanted upon the base of the trainers, adding to her timely design. Her usually threatening demeanour had softened intensely after meeting Justin. 


Justin made his way down the stairs as Roxi continued to ready herself. He grabbed four pieces of bread (two white and two brown) and placed them in the toaster. He and Roxi each had two pieces each morning and his had to be upon white bread. Roxi preferred brown bread but it wasn't a necessity. 


""Justin"" Roxi complained ""We have no more Jam""

""There should be some in the drawer under the microwave,""

""I'll look now,""

She clambered around for a few seconds as Justin readied a knife to spread the softened butter across his now-toasted bread. Pieces of gold spread through the blinds and Justin walked over to open them.

""HERE WE ARE!""

""Roxi"" Justin said with disappointment, ""Not so loud this early""

""Sorry sorry,"" she had let her excitement overcome her after locating her target.

""Pass it over here then,"" Justin had been passed the blackcurrant jam and spread it upon Roxi's two pieces of Brown toast.

They both scoffed down their breakfast and grabbed themselves a drink. Justin grabbed his water from the fridge and poured it into a cup that was covered in clocks. Roxi poured some coffee into a flask and tightened the lid with a counterclockwise motion until it refused to move. 

""Roxi I think it's tight enough,"" Justin had a twinge of sarcasm in his voice but enough to not sound egotistical.

""Sure but remember last week,""

""That was human error, Roxi,""

""Are you implying I could ever do wrong, Roxi said in a faux aristocratic accent.

""Of course not, my liege,"" Justin replied, clearly seeing Roxi's sarcasm and matching her energy.


They both left through the mahogany door, escaping the strong paint smell emanating from the door. A new coat of paint had to be added for the door to stay its lovely charcoal colour. Or, as Justin would say, it's midnight colour. One of the petty quarrels that they had debated about on their way to work. The golden recently refurbished doorknob had stopped coming half off upon every opening of the door. They both approached their grey car, a new Vauxhall from later on in Twenty-Three. 

BH73 UNH. Justin had obsessed over Roxi memorising the number plate in case it was ever needed. She, of course, didn't want to, but after arguing about it, she remembered the first four digits. They both climbed in the front and Roxi took the driver's seat as Justin had been the last to drive.

Roxi turned the radio down and began to start a conversation, ""Excited for the new class,""

""The last class were such pains, all up themselves but their powers just weren't it""

""Justin they're children,""

""I do miss them, though,"" Justin's voice became sombre.

""You couldn't have stopped it,"" Roxi became empathetic. ""It isn't your fault,""

""This new class seems to have some unbelievable talent,"" Justin sounded hopeful ""Might be enough to beat Sylas finally""

""Don't pressure yourself, Justin,"" 

""Love you, Roxi,""

For the rest of the short drive, the music was the main speaker, starting conversations with what felt like the world itself. They arrived at the school.
'VOSS' SCHOOL FOR THE GIFTED

The name was a cover for the actual school but the name wasn't technically a lie. The children they took on were undeniably gifted. Not all of them used this gift well. People wanted to get ahead I the world, and tried to use their power to cheat their way forward. The ones from the class of 20' who had tried this failed to succeed. Even after four years of trials and tribulations they hadn't managed to rival Justin. So they waited until he was out the country to let the rest of the class succumb.

Justin and Roxi both went through the double doors together. The white corridors with a fresh coat of paint held a welcoming smell to the pair. Their first order of business was to report to Orion Voss' office to take their attendance sheets for the upcoming year. Justin walked past the small housing rooms that most students chose to stay in over the school year. Justin stared into one room in particular. Room 39. He looked at the newly replaced wooden door, made from mahogany with a silver doorknob and froze.

""Justin?"" Roxi had a clear worry in her voice.
 
Justin snapped out of his trance hearing Roxi start to turn into her old self that she tried so hard to hide. 

""Sorry Roxi I just feel like I've seen this door before.""

""Yeah you got it thrown at your head last year remember?""

""It's wasn't thirty nine was it?""

""I think it was but it might have been fourty nine now I think about it.""

""It doesn't matter, let's get to Orion's office.""

They both made their way up to the opposing corridor and carried on through the sky blue floors until they reached a lavish oak door. The door was around seven foot tall (which Justin and Roxi fit through with relating ease) and had a worn coat of brown paint, seemingly the only untouched part of the schools renovations. At around eye level for Justin, he saw a few chips in the otherwise well-kempt door. Justin pulled down the wooden handle of the door and entered, Roxi not far behind.

""Christ Orion,"" Roxi blurted out ""Your office looks straight out the the 1900s.""

The floor was made of a dark wood, probably mahogany or maple. The navy carpet with little tuffs of fabric at the end stood in the centre of the room, welcoming those who were new to the office. Silver file cabinets lay attached to the walls like a  lost child who had finally finding their parents. Each draw contained sensitive information about previous, current and future students who's parents of themselves had registered. Alongside the student information, information on those who used their power evily and well stayed stoic in their homes. Orion wasn't just a headteacher but one of the most important men in keeping powers secret and their society in line.

Orion stood up from his sleek, white desk and shook Roxi's hand. ""Miss Armstrong, your first time in the office?""

""Yes, remember last year my first meeting was in my room,""

""Ahh of course, well in any case welcome to the new year, both of you,""

""Sir will my class be bigger than last year?""

""Yes but it won't be massive, still no more than five but you will sub in for Justin's clas this year,""

""She will?"" Justin didn't even try and conceal his surprise.

""Yes Justin,"" Orion clearly want phased. ""I know you want to be the one to train those who defeat Sylas, but you have to make concessions.""

""No it's fine I needn't worry"" he looked at Roxi with love. ""She's incredibly well trained,""

""Well if all that's settled, go get to your classrooms and don't worry, your registry is up there for you to read,""

This is what Justin had waited for all throughout the summer and even leaking into previous years. He constantly yearned for someone who would surpass the current greats. Nond from his past classes went on to be protectors. He bore no grudge against those he taught, he just wished they'd grown further. But waiting and lementing on the past wouldn't change the present. Justin thought about the student be would take on. They would be fourteen-years-old. So what powers hadn't appeared in the last fourteen years. His mind hit a blank but that didnt mean that the powers would be weak, just that his brain was. Even though this would be his eight year of teaching, he had only taught around thirty students. This year he could climb into double digits. Most of the kids he taught had either had a no desire to be a protector or work ethic, so they could never be true protectors. 

Of course a 'bad' power didn't technically exist but there was a clear fluctuating power curve. You needed a power that had a clear line to the top. Something that needed little explanation as to it's power.

Justin made his way towards his classroom. He made his back down the corridor and into the first door om the left of the teacher amd staff entrance. He walked into the classroom, it looking the same as lasy year. This corner of the school was untouched. He walked over to his desk and slumped into the chair. He saw from the corner of his eye a yellow, laminated registry printed unto his desk. 

The pit of Justin's stomach awoken and talked to the rest of his body. His fears of failure were crawling out of him. All the years of trying to train classes and last years failure meant he needed this year to succeed. He looked at the registry and only the names of the powers were currently written. They would all face a test specifically to test them and them alone. Until they passed that the name column would remain blank. He had to look at the powers and base it of that for now. He looked at the sheet and examined the powers carefully:

Water Manipulation 

Fire Manipulation 

Electrical Manipulation 

Shadow Manipulation 

Ice Manipulation 

Weight Manipulation 

Plant Manipulation 

Earth Manipulation 

Psychic Abilities 

Aether Manipulation 

Sound Manipulation 

Healing 

What an array. Not a single power without a use. Justin had read over it a few times, from bottom to top, top to bottom and in any patterns his brain could imagine. And the amount. Twelve students. He hadn't expected that many but it was astounding to have grown to this level. He now had to pray they all passed their student examinations. He was over the moon but didn't want to show it.

""JUSTIN!""

Justin shot up and turned around, his eyes wide and his body tense. 

""Orion, you fucking scared me there,""

""Good, good anyhow, I'd like you to come to the training ground and examine the students we have this year,""

""We have a new speaker system and you still thought it necessary to try amd give me an aneurism?""

""Aggresive today are we?""

""I will put you down,""

""And as sure as I am that you can do that, are you coming down to watch or not?:

""Yes I'll be there,""

 ""LOVELY, I'LL SEE YOU THERE,""

The lights flickered and all went off, then shone incredibly brightly. Justin blinked to adapt to the new brightness. His eyelids flipped like the switch of his room which he couldn't currently see. Then the lights all went out and Justin looked to his switch to make sure it wasn't Orion.

""Roxi thank God it's you and not Voss,""

""Justin he isn't that bad,""

""You haven't known him for twelve years,""

""Hey that reminds me how does the schooling system work here? Do you only have one class at a time?""

""The class that left last year was nit my only class. You have a new class every two years. First and third years do academic and in school work, second years do an out of school program and fourth years do both plus start to take on missions,""

""So your other class are third years now yes?""

""Unfortunately the small size of the class plus last year means that the five students decided to not return this year,""

""Sad but in other news had Orion invited you down to the field?""

""Yes I'll be down soon,""

""Why not now?""

Roxi moved her arms and the clocks stopped ticking, cars froze and birds were at a standstill. 

""Don't mind if I do,""

Justin and Roxi walked to the field arm in arm and they made their way into the training arena. They both sat in the teacher designated seats. Roxi resumed time and Orion arrived within seconds and sat himself next to Justin. Orion spoke either a grin but his voice echoed seriousness.

""Will the first student please step forward to the examination,""

""What power is this?"" Justin asked tentatively.

Orion looked at Justin in suspense.

I started a new job recently and it's been so difficult for some reason - the hunger is real and I'm suddenly finding sticking to my calories feeling impossible. I do recognize the slight bump up in the stress, but more or less my binging is still under control.

So after much thought I've realized what happened: I had inadvertently also been doing IF while I was on unemployment the whole time. Because my sleep got mixed up, I was in the habit of only eating two meals a day - a light lunch and a larger dinner. I was basically doing 16:8 just naturally and not even realizing it. But holy crap the difference was night and day going back.... My relationship with food seems to have changed so much since. And I really hate it.

So while I'm still of the opinion that CICO is what weight loss boils down to, I'm also now accepting and realizing the accuracy of hormone fluctuations and how IF can help.

So today has been the first day I've given it a go - my eating window is 12p-8p. Oddly enough, making it to 12p after working all morning and only having black iced coffee was pretty easy. I was hungry, but back to recognizing it as true hunger and not insulin spikes. 

Has anyone else sort of stumbled into this pattern of eating by accident? Or who merges the calorie counting and IF together? I am planning on counting calories and hope this makes it much easier.

I honestly don't know what to expect going forward and it's possible my conclusion of having basically done IF in the past is wrong... but I'm really hoping for good results here!",1,1729287502.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

At the break of dawn, Justin slowly emerged from his sleep, the dim light filtering through the window allowing his eyes to adjust gradually. Reaching over to the quaint bookshelf at the foot of his bed, he retrieved his phone to check the time.

""Roxi, it's already six. Time to rise,"" he called out, nudging the figure on his left.

A muffled groan of resistance met his ears. ""Let me rewind time for a moment,"" Roxi murmured sleepily.

""No, you've already done that tonight. Come on, get up,"" Justin insisted.

""Such a commander,"" Roxi teased.

""You know that's not true,"" Justin retorted with a smile.

She leaned over and planted a kiss on his cheek. ""Yes, baby.""

Together, they began to prepare for the day. Justin opted for a simple ensemble - a crisp blue shirt paired with black trousers and a matching tie. He chose a charcoal, dirtied blazer that he had forgotten to wash the night before. He thought about asking Roxi to rewind time but opted not to as he barely wore the blazer through the day anyway


Roxi wore a brown dress with golden clocks on it, all showing various times on them, and all seemingly moving as she did. Similarly coloured golden shoes with Roman numerals implanted upon the base of the trainers, adding to her timely design. Her usually threatening demeanour had softened intensely after meeting Justin. 


Justin made his way down the stairs as Roxi continued to ready herself. He grabbed four pieces of bread (two white and two brown) and placed them in the toaster. He and Roxi each had two pieces each morning and his had to be upon white bread. Roxi preferred brown bread but it wasn't a necessity. 


""Justin"" Roxi complained ""We have no more Jam""

""There should be some in the drawer under the microwave,""

""I'll look now,""

She clambered around for a few seconds as Justin readied a knife to spread the softened butter across his now-toasted bread. Pieces of gold spread through the blinds and Justin walked over to open them.

""HERE WE ARE!""

""Roxi"" Justin said with disappointment, ""Not so loud this early""

""Sorry sorry,"" she had let her excitement overcome her after locating her target.

""Pass it over here then,"" Justin had been passed the blackcurrant jam and spread it upon Roxi's two pieces of Brown toast.

They both scoffed down their breakfast and grabbed themselves a drink. Justin grabbed his water from the fridge and poured it into a cup that was covered in clocks. Roxi poured some coffee into a flask and tightened the lid with a counterclockwise motion until it refused to move. 

""Roxi I think it's tight enough,"" Justin had a twinge of sarcasm in his voice but enough to not sound egotistical.

""Sure but remember last week,""

""That was human error, Roxi,""

""Are you implying I could ever do wrong, Roxi said in a faux aristocratic accent.

""Of course not, my liege,"" Justin replied, clearly seeing Roxi's sarcasm and matching her energy.


They both left through the mahogany door, escaping the strong paint smell emanating from the door. A new coat of paint had to be added for the door to stay its lovely charcoal colour. Or, as Justin would say, it's midnight colour. One of the petty quarrels that they had debated about on their way to work. The golden recently refurbished doorknob had stopped coming half off upon every opening of the door. They both approached their grey car, a new Vauxhall from later on in Twenty-Three. 

BH73 UNH. Justin had obsessed over Roxi memorising the number plate in case it was ever needed. She, of course, didn't want to, but after arguing about it, she remembered the first four digits. They both climbed in the front and Roxi took the driver's seat as Justin had been the last to drive.

Roxi turned the radio down and began to start a conversation, ""Excited for the new class,""

""The last class were such pains, all up themselves but their powers just weren't it""

""Justin they're children,""

""I do miss them, though,"" Justin's voice became sombre.

""You couldn't have stopped it,"" Roxi became empathetic. ""It isn't your fault,""

""This new class seems to have some unbelievable talent,"" Justin sounded hopeful ""Might be enough to beat Sylas finally""

""Don't pressure yourself, Justin,"" 

""Love you, Roxi,""

For the rest of the short drive, the music was the main speaker, starting conversations with what felt like the world itself. They arrived at the school.
'VOSS' SCHOOL FOR THE GIFTED

The name was a cover for the actual school but the name wasn't technically a lie. The children they took on were undeniably gifted. Not all of them used this gift well. People wanted to get ahead I the world, and tried to use their power to cheat their way forward. The ones from the class of 20' who had tried this failed to succeed. Even after four years of trials and tribulations they hadn't managed to rival Justin. So they waited until he was out the country to let the rest of the class succumb.

Justin and Roxi both went through the double doors together. The white corridors with a fresh coat of paint held a welcoming smell to the pair. Their first order of business was to report to Orion Voss' office to take their attendance sheets for the upcoming year. Justin walked past the small housing rooms that most students chose to stay in over the school year. Justin stared into one room in particular. Room 39. He looked at the newly replaced wooden door, made from mahogany with a silver doorknob and froze.

""Justin?"" Roxi had a clear worry in her voice.
 
Justin snapped out of his trance hearing Roxi start to turn into her old self that she tried so hard to hide. 

""Sorry Roxi I just feel like I've seen this door before.""

""Yeah you got it thrown at your head last year remember?""

""It's wasn't thirty nine was it?""

""I think it was but it might have been fourty nine now I think about it.""

""It doesn't matter, let's get to Orion's office.""

They both made their way up to the opposing corridor and carried on through the sky blue floors until they reached a lavish oak door. The door was around seven foot tall (which Justin and Roxi fit through with relating ease) and had a worn coat of brown paint, seemingly the only untouched part of the schools renovations. At around eye level for Justin, he saw a few chips in the otherwise well-kempt door. Justin pulled down the wooden handle of the door and entered, Roxi not far behind.

""Christ Orion,"" Roxi blurted out ""Your office looks straight out the the 1900s.""

The floor was made of a dark wood, probably mahogany or maple. The navy carpet with little tuffs of fabric at the end stood in the centre of the room, welcoming those who were new to the office. Silver file cabinets lay attached to the walls like a  lost child who had finally finding their parents. Each draw contained sensitive information about previous, current and future students who's parents of themselves had registered. Alongside the student information, information on those who used their power evily and well stayed stoic in their homes. Orion wasn't just a headteacher but one of the most important men in keeping powers secret and their society in line.

Orion stood up from his sleek, white desk and shook Roxi's hand. ""Miss Armstrong, your first time in the office?""

""Yes, remember last year my first meeting was in my room,""

""Ahh of course, well in any case welcome to the new year, both of you,""

""Sir will my class be bigger than last year?""

""Yes but it won't be massive, still no more than five but you will sub in for Justin's clas this year,""

""She will?"" Justin didn't even try and conceal his surprise.

""Yes Justin,"" Orion clearly want phased. ""I know you want to be the one to train those who defeat Sylas, but you have to make concessions.""

""No it's fine I needn't worry"" he looked at Roxi with love. ""She's incredibly well trained,""

""Well if all that's settled, go get to your classrooms and don't worry, your registry is up there for you to read,""

This is what Justin had waited for all throughout the summer and even leaking into previous years. He constantly yearned for someone who would surpass the current greats. Nond from his past classes went on to be protectors. He bore no grudge against those he taught, he just wished they'd grown further. But waiting and lementing on the past wouldn't change the present. Justin thought about the student be would take on. They would be fourteen-years-old. So what powers hadn't appeared in the last fourteen years. His mind hit a blank but that didnt mean that the powers would be weak, just that his brain was. Even though this would be his eight year of teaching, he had only taught around thirty students. This year he could climb into double digits. Most of the kids he taught had either had a no desire to be a protector or work ethic, so they could never be true protectors. 

Of course a 'bad' power didn't technically exist but there was a clear fluctuating power curve. You needed a power that had a clear line to the top. Something that needed little explanation as to it's power.

Justin made his way towards his classroom. He made his back down the corridor and into the first door om the left of the teacher amd staff entrance. He walked into the classroom, it looking the same as lasy year. This corner of the school was untouched. He walked over to his desk and slumped into the chair. He saw from the corner of his eye a yellow, laminated registry printed unto his desk. 

The pit of Justin's stomach awoken and talked to the rest of his body. His fears of failure were crawling out of him. All the years of trying to train classes and last years failure meant he needed this year to succeed. He looked at the registry and only the names of the powers were currently written. They would all face a test specifically to test them and them alone. Until they passed that the name column would remain blank. He had to look at the powers and base it of that for now. He looked at the sheet and examined the powers carefully:

Water Manipulation 

Fire Manipulation 

Electrical Manipulation 

Shadow Manipulation 

Ice Manipulation 

Weight Manipulation 

Plant Manipulation 

Earth Manipulation 

Psychic Abilities 

Aether Manipulation 

Sound Manipulation 

Healing 

What an array. Not a single power without a use. Justin had read over it a few times, from bottom to top, top to bottom and in any patterns his brain could imagine. And the amount. Twelve students. He hadn't expected that many but it was astounding to have grown to this level. He now had to pray they all passed their student examinations. He was over the moon but didn't want to show it.

""JUSTIN!""

Justin shot up and turned around, his eyes wide and his body tense. 

""Orion, you fucking scared me there,""

""Good, good anyhow, I'd like you to come to the training ground and examine the students we have this year,""

""We have a new speaker system and you still thought it necessary to try amd give me an aneurism?""

""Aggresive today are we?""

""I will put you down,""

""And as sure as I am that you can do that, are you coming down to watch or not?:

""Yes I'll be there,""

 ""LOVELY, I'LL SEE YOU THERE,""

The lights flickered and all went off, then shone incredibly brightly. Justin blinked to adapt to the new brightness. His eyelids flipped like the switch of his room which he couldn't currently see. Then the lights all went out and Justin looked to his switch to make sure it wasn't Orion.

""Roxi thank God it's you and not Voss,""

""Justin he isn't that bad,""

""You haven't known him for twelve years,""

""Hey that reminds me how does the schooling system work here? Do you only have one class at a time?""

""The class that left last year was nit my only class. You have a new class every two years. First and third years do academic and in school work, second years do an out of school program and fourth years do both plus start to take on missions,""

""So your other class are third years now yes?""

""Unfortunately the small size of the class plus last year means that the five students decided to not return this year,""

""Sad but in other news had Orion invited you down to the field?""

""Yes I'll be down soon,""

""Why not now?""

Roxi moved her arms and the clocks stopped ticking, cars froze and birds were at a standstill. 

""Don't mind if I do,""

Justin and Roxi walked to the field arm in arm and they made their way into the training arena. They both sat in the teacher designated seats. Roxi resumed time and Orion arrived within seconds and sat himself next to Justin. Orion spoke either a grin but his voice echoed seriousness.

""Will the first student please step forward to the examination,""

""What power is this?"" Justin asked tentatively.

Orion looked at Justin in suspense.

1g6tddy,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1g6tddy/gourmand_lover_tries_to_find_their_zoologist_match/,Gourmand lover tries to find their zoologist match,"My venture into sampling zoologist came from my want to find a honey fragrance. Now I am one of those people who likes to blind buy full bottles of expensive frags because I like the thrill (most of the time it does work in my favour, yes I am addicted to spending money, moving on) but I decided to play it safe for zoologist and thank god, beelzebub and all inbetween

After blind buying Brooklyn Ellis bee and being happy with it, I decided I wouldn't blind buy zoologist bee and just sample it, along with others that had some sort of tasty, fresh, zesty or juicy note

While I enjoy thick gourmands (my faves as Jousset Le Gourmand, Killian Angels Share, Aquolina Pink Sugar, SDJ Cheirosa 71), I also like lighter things with hints of gourmand too, like fruity, or fresh and watery with a breeze of apple in the wind idk. I didn't go into this expecting a fragrance called ""Animal Husk Skinned Alive"" to smell like birthday cake, but some of the frags are really not what I expected akjdfhskjf

Just to preface again, I have very simple tastes. I like sugar, sweet gourmands. My nose does not handle other notes well at all, no matter how much I smell ""complex"" scents, most notes just don't hit me right, but this seemed fun, since I have never gone out and just bought this many samples before - so that's the perspective of these impressions

**Bee**  
The first one I sampled, and really got my hopes up. It is very thick, gooey, resinous. I have smelled honey before, and this is honey. When I compare it to my Brooklyn Ellis one, that one is like a sweet, light, sugary, feminine honey. Zoologist one is denser, but it also smells like.. tree

If honey were extracted out of trees like maple syrup, that's what this would be. I really enjoy it, and if I got this instead of my BE one, I would have kept it. But as it stands, they are too similar for this to warrant its own bottle. It is still unique, but it is... a honey scent. I don't need more lol

**Chipmunk**  
I was absolutely enthralled by the thought of mandarin, cardamom, nutmeg, hazlenut, patchouli. They are all things I like, and I kind of airheadedly ignored the rest of the notes in hopes these would shine through

I don't think they did. It is not nutty, not creamy, not warm. It is however earthy, green, the spices elevate it to kind of a ... freshly rummaged damp soil scent with a tinge of ""mens perfume"" aura. I don't know which ones, but when I go out and men with lots of perfume pass by, and they leave a trail of aggresivve, spicy, fresh scent, this has that at a very toned down level

Upon initial spray however, I got a little scent of poop skdfjhskfjs It faded very fast but that mf nearly knocked me out. Needless to say I will not be wearing this again, ever

**Cow**  
Could not be more excited for one than I was for this. I love milk, I love apple, I love cute little flowers like jasmine and heliotrope. The thought of smelling like I was about to frolick in the fields with some well behaved cows made me so happy. I grew up in an area where farmers often walked their cows, and that was, absolutely NOT the smell that followed them so I was excited to live my cow fantasy

The opening, drew tears from my eyes. A REAL GREEN APPLE AN ACTUAL APPLE. I did say I love sweet simple scents, but god damn I have had enough of those apple candy scents, and this one starts off SO fresh and juicy, with mild sweetness. An apple that's not too sweet, but not sour is perfect

There's also something quite minty about it. It doesn't SMELL minty, but when you bite into a mint leaf, and taste it... it's like the smell of the taste of that. I think it brings out the apple for a bit, but after sometime the mint sticks around and the apple is gone, which is a little sad but oh well

Then... it becomes warm.. and stale.. and very feral in a way. It smells like an open dry mouth, so it's a little stinky, but like someone tried to cover it up with a mint.. ahhh

**Rabbit**  
No.. my.. beloved... It opened up with the sweet taste of freshly cracked biscuits. MY gourmand DREAM. Then it smelled like my dads dirty socks üò≠ As that faded off, the remaining scent is very nostalgic. It smells a lot like a church bench. And yes I know because for some reason most of the times I was forced to go there I often found my nose up to the wood for some reason or another (no I was not trying to smell peoples leftover butt aroma)

It's not BAD, but it's not pleasant. It really gives me very sweet, churchy, kneeling-at-the-bench-and-there's-the-wood-of-the-bench-in-your-face vibes, except there's a lovely lady baking super greasy, buttery biscuits in the kitchenette attached to the church. It's a vibe I guess, just not one I want to smell like

**Panda**  
I'm so sorry but I get a warm feces scent right in the opening with this too. I. Don't. Know. What. This. IS. But it's a fresh warm bit of leftover matter. Like, someone didn't pick up after their dog (Except it is human remains they didn't pick up after), and it's kind of marinating in the fresh crisp air of a park near the sea, you're just sitting nearby enough to get wafts of this entering your nostril, then a cooling breeze fills your nose with freshness, until the... warmth... is nigh again And repeat. Sigh

**Snowy Owl**  
Wow. I like this. It smells like a shoe box. A new box, that's been sitting in storage. You get home and open your new pair of shoes and then the aroma of the inside of the box hits. Cardboard, homely, exciting. It smells somewhere between this, and the scent of wooden floorboards in a room that's being built, for a shoe store. Idk why so much shoe adjacent vibes but it just has this feel that I can't describe

It's pleasant enough

**Hummingbird**  
Ohh yes. There it is. A blast of cherry, a tinge of bitter. This smells like when I would dip my fingers in my moms wine glass and lick it off. Then it transforms into such a soft, sweet floral. I generally hate florals but this is just, so, \~pretty\~. Light and sweet and girly omg

Upon drydown it smells like those little cherry sweets, the hard shell which has a gooey sweet filling, so when you bite the sweet it pops in your mouth

I just love how creamy it smells. It gives me vibes of Killian Can't Stop Loving You, which is also a super creamy floral also with honey. This one is even more creamy, and mild, and so sweet with the bit of cherry. I think pretty is the only word I can use for it.  This is one to wear with a cute frilly minidress, spinning round in circles

If the best parts of PdM Oriana, Killian ICSLY, a cherry hard candy, and spoon of honey, has a baby. This would be it. If you want to smell **pretty**, this is the scent. It's not beautiful, it's not cute, it's not adorable, it is PRETTY embodied into a scent. I need a full bottle

Whipped cream, cherry, honey, soft soothing creamy florals. ugh. i cant. get. enough.

**Cockatiel**  
Sorry I have no fucking idea what I'm smelling. It's nice? But kind of not? But I kind of can't stop smelling it? It's like when you saw something very disturbing but you can't look away, except this isn't disturbing it's just, confusing

IT's so sweet, in such a, not edible way. I mean first of all my ockatiels did not have the pleasure of smelling like this, I tried to draw comparisons to maybe their feathers, or their feed but nothing familiar there

The scent is still famliar in some way. But very... not real. Often I have dreams where there are faces I ""know"" but don't recognise, this is the scent version of it. I get the powedery, and I get the sweet, and then I get... resinous and woody? and Plasticky? I don't want to like this, because I don't know what it is, but I kind of might end up liking it... it's sample finishing worthy just out of sheer morbid curiosity. But I would only wear this when alone

**Harvest Mouse**  
This one is super light, that I can barely really smell what's there. To me it smells partly like dove soap mixed with coca cola haribo gummies. It's sweet, it's warm, creamy and it's light. Tbh this is such a pleasant, well rounded fragrance I think it would be hard to dislike. Definitely finishing the sample. Out of all of them this is honestly the most wearable

After I tested it some more, I ralised, it smells incredibly similar to Xerjoff Dolce Amalfi to me. They both have this haribo cola or apple chupachups smell, but done in a really warm mild way.

**Dragonfly**  
Well, this is just a basic, spicy green, floral to me. The exact formula of scent that I don't enjoy. Smells quite masculine but basic and crowd pleasing. I really don't have anything more to say about it

**Penguin**  
This smells a lot like a fresh deodorant, the spicy cucumber ones. This is literally a man scent. Like when you smell a man, he's going to smell like this. The kind of man that uses a fresh body wash, then uses a fresh deodorant and MAYBE a tinge of body spray

**Beaver (Maple Edition)**  
I actually was not even going to open this packet. It was a bonus free sample and when I saw it, I thought, ""god damn its going to smell like a beaver breath isn't it"". but it smells fucking incredible. It is..... a gourmand omg? IT smells like coffee and male syrup. There is a little bit of green spicy in there I think it's the woody notes

This is my favourite coffee scent, right behind TK Coffee Addict. This one is less cloying gourmand, and just, hinting at a gourmand. I think it does kind of smell like maggi/food spices though, which I also experienced with Kerosene Followed, but since that one was so thick, nuclear and cloying it was really hard to look past. With Beaver Maple it's so tolerable

It's also warm, kind of like warm breath, without smelling like breath. Very intriguing, with room for things to go wrong. This one I will need a travel size of ngl

**Seahorse**  
Holy shit this is nutty? If mens shower gel were tasty, nutty and edible, this is exactly what it would smell like. It's just so ethereal and hypnotising. This is what a male fairy smells like, like the tinkerbell twink. If terence were a real person this is what he would wear. This was the most unexpected favourite out of this purchase

**Squid**  
Oh no lol. I have never smelled squids ink before, but I think this is what it would smell like. Repulsive, pungent, vinegary, very... ""my unappetizing secretions just came out of my hole"" kind of smell. The dry down is more tolerable, but nothing, is worth what preceeds it",5,1729287421.0,fragrance,5,0.78,False

Dave Compensated with a long-sleeved shirt, sweater, and windbreaker combo; his wife would not let him leave the house with anything less. The semi-hot coffee in his Styrofoam cup slowly steamed into the crisp morning air as he leaned against his Ford pick-up waiting for the busy line of crabbers to launch their boats.  He peered into the coffee he had picked up from the local convenience store, ‚ÄúDelilah‚Äôs‚Äù just 10 minutes earlier. Although the store advertised the brewed coffee as ‚ÄúBest coffee in town! Freshly Brewed!‚Äù the coffee seemed to have a burnt taste, indicating it had been sitting out on the burner for at least a few hours. Nothing cream and sugar couldn‚Äôt fix, even though he preferred it black. Nevertheless, he savored the taste as he pulled another sip from the thick Styrofoam cup.  Dave felt a thin layer of coffee cling to his mustache as he drew the cup away, one of the few issues that came with such a fashion choice, but having a mustache, or ‚Äústache‚Äù as his son‚Äôs referred to it, really suited his aging face. 

He looked into the crooked side view mirror to help guide his windbreaker sleeve and rub off any excess coffee. As he wiped the remnants of coffee away, Dave admired the remaining spackle of black hair not only in his now fully grey head but also in his mustache. *Christ*, he was not only feeling old but also looking the part.  It was at least better than his friend and neighbor Bill Hatchers who lived across the street from him.  Bill was around the same age as Dave but had lost what was left of his hair about 8 years ago. *Ain‚Äôt that a bitch*, Dave had thought at the time.  

A squeal of old brakes pulled his attention up from the mirror. A truck and trailer was pulling out from the launch and Dave was now next in line to go. He popped the Styrofoam cup‚Äôs plastic lid back on and pulled himself inside the truck onto an old patchy bench seat. The launch of the boat had not gone as smoothly as he would have hoped, but isn‚Äôt that what everyone thought when pulling such a maneuver?  The awkward sharp curve in the boat launch approach did not provide any favors either when pulling around to back in, but Dave managed to pull it off as he had done many times before.  After successfully launching his boat, he parked the pickup in one of the many elongated parking spots nearby in the adjacent gravel lot - if you can call spray paint on loose gravel a ‚Äúparking spot‚Äù. He didn‚Äôt bother locking his old pick-up next to other empty trucks in the lot, as neither did anyone else that morning and started his way down to the dock. 

The thick rubber brown boots he was wearing crunched on the gravel as he walked toward the dock, and then moved to a soft thud as he transitioned onto the dock‚Äôs surface where the boat was tied onto one of the many silver cleats. Dave bought the 18-foot aluminum boat from a friend of a friend down in Seattle about 10 years ago.  On his way back from the purchase he had also bought the Yamaha outboard engine, from somewhere more local, when he got back into town the following day. The boat itself had a single bench seat closer to the bow and a single swivel chair sticking out near the stern closest to the motor, for easier steering.  This left a decent amount of room in the middle of the boat for gear, a cooler - and in the case of this morning - crab pots.  Although the boat had no name painted on the side of the aluminum shell, Dave had referred to his tiny vessel as ‚ÄúRadar‚Äù, after his childhood German Shepard that accompanied him as a boy. Dave liked this name not only due to it being his late dog‚Äôs name but also thought the name suited the boat great for occasions such as this one.  The name itself gave good luck when looking for *just* the right spot to drop crab pots. 

He swung his leg over the side of the boat, being careful not to clip his boot on the crab pots stacked neatly between the bench seat and the swivel chair. He wouldn‚Äôt dare be seen falling into the boat or even worse, out of the boat, in front of the audience that was amassed at the top of the boat launch waiting their turn this morning. Dave swung his other leg into the safety of the boat and settled onto the cracked leather chair, placing his coffee in a crudely made cup holder attached to the rim of the boat. He then turned to pull back on the old, frayed rip cord on the face of the Yamaha engine.  With the first few attempts, the old engine sputtered, came to life, then died. The outboard motor could definitely use replacing. *Next year*, Dave Thought. Although he had been saying that now for the past two. 

The squawk of seagulls was starting to become louder and more evident as the morning started to warm even with the gloomy overcast. He yanked again on the rip cord, and this time the engine sprang to life, drowning out the above seagulls. Looking up, Dave threw up a wave to the old man patiently waiting to back in. With little effort, Dave swung the boat outward facing toward open ocean, then slowly drifted Radar out of the launch area. 

Brimmer Bay, or ‚ÄúBrim‚Äù as locals in the area call it, is one of the last places in Washington to open for Dungeness; and due to this, Dave never wasted a season.  This was his 33rd year as an active participant in the recreational crabbing season and he always made time for opening day, even in choppy conditions like this.  As he slowly moved out of the vicinity of the boat launch, the wind slightly picked up, as he pulled away from shore. Along with the wind, tiny swells and white caps were slapping the boat and kicking up sea spray which stung his already cold red face. 10 minutes later, farther out now, the waves seemed to die down a bit, giving Dave the go-ahead to throttle the 50-horsepower engine for some speed. The 50-horsepower engine was not necessarily ‚Äúoverkill‚Äù for a boat this size, but it definitely had some get-up-and-go when met with the right conditions. 


After 30 minutes or so, Dave‚Äôs field of view started to fill with a collection of red, white, orange, and yellow buoys which floated lamely along the top of the dark murky water, marking the first of the crab pots that early morning risers had set out before he had arrived. He began to throttle down as the cluster of buoys began to thin. The speed of the boat slowed as he passed the final remaining markers. 
Red, yellow, red again, and then nothing.  
He continued on for another five minutes until he could barely see the last red buoy he had passed.  ‚ÄúWhat do you think, Radar?‚Äù Dave asked aloud addressing the boat as if it were his childhood dog. But Dave knew - this was **the** spot. 

He killed the sputtering engine, and almost complete silence replaced the noise in his eardrums outside of the faint sound of seagulls in the distance and the small waves against the aluminum hull. This quiet could only be found when one was far enough from civilization. Dave relished it immensely; he even made the point of leaving his cell phone in the cab of his truck as to not distract him while he was out that morning. Dave took a swig of the now lukewarm coffee and placed it back into the crude cupholder.  He did not know, but that was the last he would be sipping the coffee this morning as what lay in a bucket in front of him would kill his appetite. He pulled over a sealed orange five-gallon bucket that read ‚ÄúHome Depot‚Äù and broke open the seal of the lid. The smell from what was piled in the bucket almost knocked him back.  
The refrigeration from the past two days should have dampened some of the smell, but the salmon carcasses smelled as if they were never frozen at all, and in fact, were in the later stages of rot. 
Now that Dave thought about it, had he even plugged the garage freezer in?  It had sat mostly empty this summer as he had otherwise no use for it.  He had unplugged it in July in an effort to be more ‚Äúgreen‚Äù but in reality was just an effort to save some pennies on the power bill he probably wouldn‚Äôt have missed anyway. Cursing his past self, he began to flex his hands into his Gore-Tex gloves. 

As he reached into the now open bucket to start filling the bait box of the first pot of the day, something caught his eye off to the starboard side of the boat (or in other words, his right) about 10 feet away. A thin stream of small bubbles was streaming up through the ocean depths and breaking on the surface of the water. This was not unusual to see out in the bay like this, as it can happen from a lot of different factors, but what was peculiar about this was that it was not a continuous stream in one spot, but a few different streams coming up in different lengths sporadically in an area about three feet wide. Dave allowed himself a 10- or 15-second gaze at the phenomenon before he started back on his work. As he again started cramming the bait box with the remnants of what used to be salmon, he began to hear what sounded like a small dribble coming from the same direction as the bubbles. The sound reminded him of a faucet that was ever so slightly turned on leaking into a sink or bathtub, a steady dribble. He stared up again from the bait box. 

What was there now was more than a few thin lines of bubbles. It had now graduated into a growing number of bubbles coming up in a larger area, these slightly bigger than what he had seen before. 

‚ÄúWhat in the world...‚Äù he muttered standing up from the bucket. Dave was not what you would call a tall man, but the new vantage point and angle allowed him to see better through the reflection of grey clouds on the dark ocean water. Standing up he had noticed now that the area in which he saw the bubbles was occurring in a much larger radius than he initially had thought.  The area had to have been at least 8 feet in diameter and growing. Not only that, but was the slow dribbling noise getting *louder*? Dave craned his neck without moving his feet to not rock the boat and lose his balance. Behind him, a newly discovered crop of bubbles was quickly forming just a few feet away from the other side of the boat. The look on Dave‚Äôs face had now changed from curiosity to dumbfounded, not yet scared but damn well nervous. With that, it only took Dave a second or two to decide that maybe this was not **the** spot after all.  

He sat back down on the cracked leather swivel chair, removed the Gore-Tex gloves from his hands, and felt back for the rip cord, unable to take his eyes off the collection of bubbles slowly growing around him. The area of disruption was starting to overlap where his boat stayed floating on the water. As the bubbles hit the bottom of the hull of the aluminum boat, the sound that was a slow dribble was beginning to grow so loud that it was all he could hear, the faint squawk of the seagulls and small waves he could no longer hear. His hand found the rip cord and tugged on it meekly to find tension in the line. Dave then took his eyes away from the unveiling scene around him, looked back at the engine, placed his other hand atop it to use as balance, and then yanked back. The engine came to life with a small sputter, which he could not hear, but felt with his hand on the engine, and due to the small line of cooling water jetting from the exhaust port indicating it was on. The noise from whatever was happening around him was now so loud that it reminded Dave of buzzing cicadas that he had heard as a kid when visiting his aunt Laurel in Arizona.  The cicada buzz used to be so loud that it would drown out the cheap Mexican landscaping that his aunt would hire during the heat of the summer. 

He looked up from the engine toward the shoreline that seemed so distant and tiny. *Why had he come out so far?* He thought regretfully. The distance from civilization no longer comforting Dave in the slightest. 

With that thought, he faced forward and throttled the engine. The initial sudden lurch forward knocked the coffee out of his cupholder onto the floor of the boat, and almost nearly spilled the still-open bucket of bait just at his feet. Dave did not seem to notice. 

As quickly as the boat lurched forward, it immediately stopped. The Yamaha engine had almost certainly died. ‚ÄúSON OF A BITCH!‚Äù Dave shouted. 

The noise grew impossibly louder still and the amount of bubbles hitting the aluminum hull began to vibrate the boat. The water around Radar now looked like it was coming to a boil. The vibration gave gooseflesh down Dave‚Äôs bundled-up arms and legs. 

Dave was no longer messing around. With fierce determination, he spun around toward the engine, snatched up the rip cord in his right hand, and jerked **hard** like his life depended on it. This time no stream of cooling water shot out of the exhaust port, indicating it was on, but Dave wasn‚Äôt looking for the stream of water from the exhaust port, he was distracted with what was now sitting in his hand. The frayed line that was the ripcord had snapped away from the Yamaha engine and dangled dumbly out of Dave‚Äôs hand that clutched the knob. Dave stood unmoving with a look of cold disbelief.  

It took a moment for his brain to kick back on. Snapping back into reality, Dave began looking around wildly in all directions for **any** indication of life. Looking for a boat to wave at frantically for help. But he did not see any boats. 
*Where was everyone?* 
He knew it was early, but this was opening day!  There had to be others out on the bay.  
Although there were others out that day, Dave did not know that soon after departing the boat launch, the older gentleman whom he had waved to, backed his large trailer and boat directly into the dock with such force that it dislodged the dock for any other would-be crabbers that morning. Later, the old man would blame the curve that led down to the boat ramp, saying ‚ÄúThat it should not be so sharp!‚Äù. This reasoning would not ultimately save him from the fact he would be paying to repair the dock, but others did agree with his statement. That singular boat launch was the most popular not only due to its convenience but also because it was the *only* one serving the general public in the area.  You would have to drive 45 miles out of Brimmer Bay to the adjacent harbor of Awhauktoo Bay to launch, which many folks ended up doing that day.  One individual even remarked Dave was ‚Äúone lucky fuck‚Äù as they watched the sole crabber drone out into the bay that morning, disappearing to a dot as they made plans to drive to the adjacent harbor.   

Dave patted down his faded jeans for the familiar lump, feeling for what he already knew wasn‚Äôt there, his cell phone. Radar was not equipped with a radio, it wasn‚Äôt used enough to garner such a thing, but Dave could not help thinking about how stupid he was to not bring anything except his fucking wallet and crabbing license. The mounting frustration came out as a loud ‚ÄúFUCK‚Äù almost involuntarily from Daves's mouth.  He was stranded. 

The now completely enveloped boat was jostling back and forth, making it impossible to stand without the chance of falling overboard.  Dave could imagine a fasten seatbelt sign popping up above him as he sat back down, a captain coming over the intercom, ‚ÄúSorry folks, we are going to be hitting unexpected turbulence.  Please fasten your seatbelts for your safety until we turn off the light‚Äù. Dave braced himself on the engine and rim of the boat, waiting for whatever was to come next. 

The vibration and hum chattered his teeth. Dave clamped down hard trying to prevent his jaw from moving. Off to the right of Dave, a dim blue-gray glow could now be seen emanating from where the original batch of bubbles had sprung up earlier. At first, it was about the size of a small dinner plate, but as it grew brighter it also started expanding. The water slowly stopped bubbling and was now steadily churning as the surface tension of the water kept breaking repeatedly as if a submarine were rising from the depths. The noise from the bubbles was replaced with a low-toned hum that resonated with both the boat and Dave‚Äôs tense body. The slow-growing blue light was now the size of a large transit van, the hum so loud it began to blur Dave‚Äôs vision, making his eyes water.  With morbid curiosity and fear, Dave leaned over the side of the beat. Squinting hard Dave had a hard time discerning what was now only 10-15 feet below the water‚Äôs surface. The confusion was not only due to his blurring vision but also because what he saw made no sense. 

Large Interlaced silver rings spun below the boat. Multiple rings rotated counterclockwise and clockwise independently at a slow gentle speed. Inside of the rings appeared to be a cube-- no, a sphere *within* a cube, that was glowing with a bright blue light. Dave could not tell, but the rings seemed to have something etched along the outside of the bands, something not in any language he knew.  The low-toned hum seemed to be emitting directly from this object that lay below the boat. 

At the outer edges of the blue light that emanated from the sphere, Dave saw what had to be a large fish moving in and out of the edges of the light. Dave leaned further, his face catching licks of the roiling water, and tried to focus his vision as best he could. A large silhouette was cast in the glow of the object. The shape of the dark silhouette looked more humanoid than fish-like, although it had tendencies of both. Its elongated appendices jutting out from its unmoving body, bobbed in and out of the glow as they moved with the current. Dave could swear whatever this thing was, it could see him. He saw no eyes or face, but he **knew** it could see him. This was not a fish moving in and out of the light, but a person with impossibly long arms and legs. The head of the being did not look like a single head but something larger, the silhouette was dark, but he could swear the large oval-shaped head was staring directly at him.  Dave was frozen, staring at the creature in horror and amazement.  He tried pulling his head away, but his body was no longer obeying his mind.  A new noise had popped up, something coming from what seemed to be the creature. A loud moan was being broadcasted directly into his head, along with the hum from the object. The moan pitched up and down continuously sounding ancient and guttural. The moan seemed undecipherable, but in Dave's mind, a small phrase began to repeat. 
‚ÄúWE HAVE COME, WE HAVE COME, WE HAVE COME, WE HAVE COME‚Äù
Dave could not move his fixated gaze but could open his mouth to scream. His eyes now streaming with blood as he was forced to stare at the horror below.  

Without notice, a beam of light shot up from the rings and hit the left half of his face. The intense burning sensation slapped him from his gaze. The sudden jolt of pain seemed to grant his freedom of movement. Quickly reeling back from the scene below, he reflexively brought his hands up to his face, throwing him off balance.  Stepping back to catch his weight, his brown boot caught on the stacked crab pots. Dave started to careen down toward the edge of the boat, thinking for one second that he might be heading toward the dark water. Instead, his head clipped the side of the boat, knocking Dave unconscious and strewn beside the crab pots. 


It was dark when Dave came too. The feeling of opening his eyes to complete and utter darkness disoriented him, but his vision slowly began to adjust.  
*Had he dreamt of the events?* 
That thought slowly started to fade as he felt his face and recoiled from the touch. He was badly burnt. On top of that, he seemed to have limited vision out of his left eye. He stuck out his hands in front of him, closing his right eye he could barely make out the digits extending from both hands. The eye ached, but not as bad as his head and face.

A new thought came to him, *was he closer to shore or had he moved farther out?*  Pondering this, he sat up. 

He couldn‚Äôt tell from his surroundings; it was too dark to see the shore. He knew his better half had to have called the Coast Guard by now, but if they were looking for him, they weren‚Äôt looking in the right spot.  No lights shined on the horizon, no helicopter blades whirred, no boat engines rang in the distance. The only noise he could hear was a faint low-pitched hum. 

What *was* prominent to his dazed senses was an awful smell, the salmon from earlier that morning. Stomach turning, half from the odor, and half from the concussion he most certainly had; he threw the whole bucket into the water, which seemed to swallow up the worst of the smell. 

He dragged himself onto the bench seat rubbing his temple, avoiding the burn covering his face. 
*What was he to do now? Sit and wait?*
Dave was not too fond of that idea, but he almost certainly would be forced to do it. He scanned the horizon again, looking into the air for a helicopter, a plane, or anything at all. Would they be looking at night? He didn‚Äôt know. Dave couldn‚Äôt even see the stars that night due to the morning overcast persisting through the day and now into the night. 

Dave turned his focus to the low subtle hum that seemed to be a faint version of the hum he had heard earlier that morning. It no longer seemed to be emitting from the water below him. The surface lay almost perfectly still in the cool night, vastly different from this morning. The faint hum seemed to be coming from above him. Dave looked straight up. Squinting, he could barely make out the twisting of rings some 50 feet above. A frog caught in Dave‚Äôs throat and an involuntary whimper tried to escape his lips. 

Dave remembered now; *we have come*. He stood to his feet. 

‚ÄúWHAT DO YOU WANT?!‚Äù Dave shouted, ‚ÄúWHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT?!‚Äù. Dave was no longer scared; he was mad dog angry. If he was to die, he would not die a coward. ‚ÄúYOU PIECE OF SHIT, WHA-‚Äù. 

Blue light began to glow from the object above.  The low-pitched hum exploded now, almost as loud as it had been before. The blue light formed into a circle, then slowly started to funnel down to the boat below. 

Dave froze, tensing up. He pictured the creature silhouetted in the dark water from earlier. The long arms and legs extended out from the dark shadow that looked up from the depths. Dave‚Äôs eyes shot down to the boat, scanning the items he brought along that day. He needed a weapon.

The funnel of light halfway down now, he scrambled around on his hands and knees, frantically looking for what he always brought with him. His hands found the small pouch tucked under the bench seat closest to the stern.  Ripping it open, he brought out a small pocketknife used for cutting line or small rope. Not the most ideal weapon, but it would do. He stood back up looking into the light. 

The light was almost touching his head, Daves courage began to wane. He shrank from the light almost touching his face. Feeling desperate, in a last-ditch effort, Dave decided to do the unthinkable, he dove off the edge of the boat. 

Dave closed his eyes waiting to meet the embrace of ice-cold water, but it had not come. He slowly opened his eyes; the blue light now fully enveloped him. He was staring down at the boat. His body was not moving toward the water but moving slowly up and away. He spotted the pocketknife he had pulled out laying useless in the shrinking boat below.

 A loud moan began filling his ears, pitching up and down, mixing in with the low-pitched hum. Dave hysterically screamed out, ‚ÄúPLEASE, WHAT DO YOU WANT?! GOD WHAT DO YOU WANT?!‚Äù

The loud moan projected a phrase into Dave‚Äôs mind as it had done before, and this time, he heard a voice along with the phrase. A loud guttural moan bellowed into not only his mind but his whole body. 

**‚ÄúYOU‚Äù**

The light blinked out; the low-pitched hum was gone. 

Dave was gone. 

Radar sat idly on still water. A slight breeze now swaying the boat ever so slightly. The sun began to crest the horizon as the early morning dawn filled with the first rays of light.  The horizon slowly transitioned from darkness to a soft shade of blue. In the distance, the faint sound of a helicopter‚Äôs blade whirred.",1,1729287365.0,SciFiStories,0,1.0,False

So, considering, that there are only three types left, that don't have an island, it's very likely, that the next (hopefully not last) island will be Bug, Dragon and Poison centred.

Here's my setup:
A Charjabug/Vikavolt which I feel like seems pretty good. I like that it has AAB of coffee and the subskills seem more or less good. Its not very good, but it's definitely not the worst.

The Arbok I saw and immediately knew I had to put on this team, because it seems like a berry beast.

The same goes for the Swablu/Altaria. Once it reaches Lvl 50, it'll be insane.

The Dragonair/Dragonite I'm not so sure about, I've put another option up there, because I wasn't sure which one was better, but I don't have many Dratinis anyway.

And the last one is a Skaraborn. I don't have a good one yet, but I know I really want one, because it's a skill Pokemon, which means it can ""hold"" two triggered main skills and if the Ingredient Magnet is leveled up completely I can get up to 50 ingredients from the Skaraborn. Very good for cooking üòç

I was extremely sick from side effects the first week, but now I feel amazing! I have great energy and have been able to go to the gym more often. I do think I need to try to slow down my weight loss though, but 2.5 works so well that I‚Äôm not sure if I want to go down in dose. 

Things I like: 
‚Ä¢the Shotsy app progress screen! I also thought I‚Äôd remember my shot location each week, but I forgot and had to look back on it one day when I had a bruise on my stomach, so that was helpful. I also like seeing the estimated tirz levels. 
‚Ä¢LoseIt app. I could my calories and protein there, and I like the weight and measurements graphs. You can also add a photo to each weight update so that‚Äôs been helpful to look at!
‚Ä¢Renpho smart scale to track if I‚Äôm gaining muscle- I am! 
‚Ä¢Renpho smart tape measurer to track if I‚Äôm losing inches and see my progress. 

Additional things I‚Äôm doing;
- weekly vitamin D shots
- weekly ‚Äúslim trim‚Äù shot of L-Methionine, Inositol, Choline, B12
- taking vegan gummy vitamins (I hate swallowing pills!) of biotin, lions mane, ashwagandha, omegas
- replaced creamer in my coffee with a scoop of protein powder (I really like the Whole Foods brand protein + greens plant based French vanilla)
- I‚Äôve already been vegan most of my life, but I ate a lot of vegan junk food and liked going to restaurants. Now I‚Äôm focusing on almost completely doing all of my grocery shopping in the produce section and eating super clean. I eat a lot of veggies, homemade oil-free hummus, air fried tofu, beans, lentils
- I haven‚Äôt eaten bread or sweets or had a soda since I started it. Thanks to the tirz I don‚Äôt crave these at all. They just look like unhealthy food to me. 

I also started testosterone. I had bloodwork when I started tirz and learned I was deficient in vitamin d, on the low end of average for b12, and I had almost no testosterone at all. Low testosterone can cause weight gain. Until then, I didn‚Äôt even realize women had testosterone! I did the slow release pellets and only had 1 pellet inserted under my skin. I truly think it‚Äôs helping me build muscle and lose weight, and I feel like my workouts are so productive now. Earlier this year I was using the 5 and 8lb weights, now I can deadlift 75lbs and bench press 45. Still not a lot, but it‚Äôs fun seeing and feeling the progress. I have a personal trainer which I highly recommend if you can afford it. It keeps me accountable and I learned so many new exercises and tried things i never would have thought of on my own. I didn‚Äôt know I had bad balance (core muscles) until I started with a trainer, which has improved significantly now. 

I hope my experience and this long list of things I‚Äôve changed in my life help someone on their journey. I really think getting my vitamins and hormones to the correct levels has had a huge impact on my results. Would love to hear if anyone else has worked on their vitamin and hormone levels while taking tirz, and if you thinking it‚Äôs helping your results!",4,1729287049.0,tirzepatidecompound,0,1.0,False

Hey you!

Yes, you! The one scrolling through this endless sea of profiles, probably wondering why my post just stole a few seconds of your precious time. Well, buckle up, because it‚Äôs about to get nerdy.

I‚Äôm a 30-year-old, 6‚Äô1, bearded, heavily tattooed chubster who likes his humor dry, his games immersive, and his tattoos‚Ä¶ well, there‚Äôs a lot of them, so let‚Äôs just say ‚Äúintricate.‚Äù If you‚Äôve ever thought, ‚ÄúMan, I need a chubby Viking-looking guy who loves sci-fi and fantasy in my life,‚Äù today is your lucky day. üéâ

Here‚Äôs the rundown on me:

‚ú® The Fun Facts (I promise they‚Äôre fun) ‚ú®

	‚Ä¢	Height: Tall enough to reach the snacks on the top shelf. (6‚Äô1‚Äù, if you‚Äôre into numbers.)
	‚Ä¢	Beard: Full, glorious, and always well-groomed (except on lazy Sundays when it‚Äôs doing its own thing).
	‚Ä¢	Tattoos: They say every tattoo tells a story. Mine scream, ‚ÄúThis guy is a massive nerd.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Body Type: Chubby and proud. Built for comfort, not for speed. üí™
	‚Ä¢	Personality: I‚Äôve been called quirky, sarcastic, and chill. I‚Äôm basically a human equivalent of a quirky sidekick in your favorite RPG.
	‚Ä¢	Work: I work from home, which means I‚Äôm in my natural habitat most of the time‚Äîusually surrounded by monitors, half-empty coffee mugs, and an alarming number of Warhammer minis. (Yes, I paint those little guys.)

üéÆ Gaming Life üéÆ

Listen, if it can be played, I‚Äôve probably played it. Currently messing around in WoW (trying not to get too sucked back in), but I‚Äôm also working on an indie game, so my actual gaming time has taken a hit. Still, if you‚Äôre down for some couch co-op, a raid, or even a casual board game night, I‚Äôm in. I can easily nerd out over everything from Elden Ring to Stardew Valley (don‚Äôt even get me started on how relaxing farming is).

Also, if you ever need someone to help you rage-quit a multiplayer match or discuss the finer points of game mechanics over way too much caffeine, I‚Äôm your guy.

üõ∏ Sci-Fi & Fantasy Obsession üêâ

When I‚Äôm not working or gaming, I‚Äôm watching or listening to something sci-fi or fantasy. Have you seen Alien: Romulus? It‚Äôs on VoD now, and I may or may not have watched it an unhealthy number of times.

But hey, it‚Äôs not all about aliens and dystopian futures‚ÄîI‚Äôll throw myself into a good fantasy series too. Whether it‚Äôs magic, space battles, or dragon politics, I‚Äôm there. Bonus points if you‚Äôve got any wild theories on how The Expanse should‚Äôve ended, or if you have a favorite version of Dune (yes, that‚Äôs a very important question).

üé® Artistic Stuff üé®

Oh, and I‚Äôm a 3D artist! I‚Äôm always knee-deep in creating game environments, but I also love painting minis in my spare time. (Ever seen a perfectly detailed Space Marine? I‚Äôve got you covered.) It‚Äôs both nerdy and zen. Two birds, one stone.

So, if you‚Äôve made it this far, and you‚Äôre into bearded, tattooed nerds who can talk about game design, Star Wars lore, and whether or not pineapple belongs on pizza (it doesn‚Äôt), let‚Äôs chat!

Tell me what you‚Äôre playing right now, what your favorite game of all time is, or even better‚Äîwhat‚Äôs the best conspiracy theory you‚Äôve heard this week?

After 15 more minutes and getting rid of excess coffee powder I was left with a nice, slightly distressed look only partially covering the dial.

Was friends with this girl from work. We worked in the same office. Chatted at lunch. Was more of a work mate in my mind. She got mega obsessed with me etc. She was a virgin 45. Not disputing I liked her friendship at first. She would always treat me to lunch in the canteen as I'm struggling with bills. Anyway things went on while I was depressed and we would meet up for coffee AS FRIENDS. Big mistake I know.

 I didn't have anything to offer her back as I'm poor. Bad divorce etc. I don't even know why my stupid fuckin brain came up with the idea. But I've not had sex for a long time and she was a virgin. I said I'll have sex with you. This is before I knew what a nutter she was. Anyway sag rambling here. Low and behold I asked her to shower before hand and I done the same. When she pulled her nighty up I got a waft of her unwashed ass. I'm almost being sick typing this. I tried to ignore and switch positions but I could just see her fat ass and the smell. I entered and literally only could do 4 or 5 thrusts before I had to exit. I wasn't even fully erect or nowt due to me finding her unattractive. But she was a good friend to me. I keep getting flashbacks about the event. Only lasted about 5 minutes the whole session. After I got a whiff of her smelly ass she laid on the bed and I played it off that my meds were making me flacid. They weren't. She was. I decided to finger her sorry for the information because I didn't want to make her feel bad
 Anyway she made the most horrendous noise. Literally sounded like an animal dying. I am still so embarrassed thinking about people walking by the hotel room.

Anyway I'm sorry for sharing this but it's really been getting me Down the last few days and I feel so disgusted with myself for even going there. I shower like 4 times a day to scrub her off but doesn't make a difference. ",1,1729286571.0,Sagittarians,6,0.67,False

And lowkey I think he did too cause we would always have this intense eye contact everytime we were in the same room. Fast forward a few months, it turned out we had mutual friends from high school and ended up meeting at a house party. Wherein everyone eventually got the whiff of us having a thing for each other. They dared us to kiss in a game so we did which later turned into flirting and making out. Anyways we talked for a month, went out a couple of times, and the last time I saw him we slept together (this was last week). We had been talking somewhat consistently until then, he had days where he would disappear but not for too long. However the past few days he started acting weird on text and wasn‚Äôt really texting me. Earlier this week one of my female coworker told me how was texting her for work stuff and would come up and speak to her for work stuff (he even offered to buy her donuts and make her coffee as appreciation) and was being charming and friendly. Although I obviously never asked him about this, it really bothered me (probably cause he wasn‚Äôt texting me or communicating with me during this time). I told him he was being inconsistent with me, and he said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs how I am‚Äù this kinda hurt and I told him I don‚Äôt fuck with that (in a more subtle way).

To make a long story short I got into an accident while drunk, and got sentenced to 50 hours of AA and community service along with a hefty fine with a suspended license dangling off the side of this shit sundae. The minor details don‚Äôt matter for the context of this story so I won't speak on it. So yeah, it's a Friday night. Prime time for bar hopping but here I am sitting in an artificially lit room with bad coffee, and slightly worse company. Not to say that they were bad people, but why would we be compatible? I know, alcohol isn't all there is to life, and I agree with you. But this place is such a downer that I can't help but feel a little ill will. It's better than the county so I can't really complain that much. It's my first night though, maybe one or two of the folks will grow on me. 

‚ÄúI'd like to start off this meeting by addressing the new person in our group. Would you like to introduce yourself?‚Äù

The group leader passes me this brightly colored stick with a feather tied to it with neon string.

‚ÄúUh the name is Mike, and I got court ordered to be here. I know I'm supposed to say I'm an alcoholic but honestly I just like drinking. I don't have a problem with it, I'm just here for my hours.‚Äù

I pass the stick back to the group leader

‚ÄúWell, thank you for sharing Mike, I just want to remind you that if you want those hours signed off you have to participate.‚Äù

I nod submissively 

‚ÄúAlright, who wants to go first?‚Äù

As the group trades experiences, and the talking stick amongst each other I see this woman walk in. She looks pretty from a distance, but when she gets closer you can tell that she's not keeping up with herself. Dirty clothes, a faint smell. She sits next to me since that was the only free chair there was. 

‚ÄúLet's take a moment to welcome the new face in the room, Brian can you pass the talking stick to her?‚Äù

Brian passes the talking stick to the mystery woman but she slowly extends her arm like she's hesitant about the mere act of speaking a word. Though she does take it after a moment. 

‚ÄúHi everyone my name is Evelyn, and I have a drinking problem.‚Äù 

Everyone murmurs a hi Evelyn, I parrot the crowd after a short delay. 

‚ÄúIt all started about two weeks ago. Before that I wouldn't even consider having a drink if it wasn't the weekend. I don't know what changed in me but I started having these intense migraines that for some reason only alcohol could soothe. It spiraled from there, and here I am horribly sober, and unsure if this is the right choice. The doctor said I'm fine, and everything checks out but I don't know.‚Äù

The group leader chimes up after motioning for the talking stick.

‚ÄúThank you for sharing Evelyn, and no, you made the right decision. Life is hard but alcohol only makes life that much harder.

‚ÄúWhat a load of crap.‚Äù I thought. The only thing that makes a bad day good is a cold beer.

‚ÄúWe go by the twelve step program here at AA Evelyn, are you familiar with it?‚Äù

She shakes her head

‚ÄúWell the first step to being alcohol free is to admit that we are powerless in our addiction. And the second step is to acknowledge there is a power that can restore us to sanity.‚Äù

Evelyn motions for the talking stick which The group leader handed happily.

‚Äúgive yourself over to a higher power?‚Äù

They pass the stick again. Talking stick? More like a passing stick. Jesus, this 50 hours of this is going to drive me insane. 

‚ÄúYes, it doesn't have to be a specific religion. Any belief will work.‚Äù

She closes her eyes in acknowledgement. He continues to say that they go by the buddy system. That means that everyone has one person in this group that they can rely on so that they're not going through the twelve steps alone. And wouldn't you guess it, everyone already has a buddy. So it would only be natural that I became Evelyn's buddy. Meeting ends, I get my first two hours signed off. I turn to the door, and when I get out I see Evelyn smoking a cigarette. She looks kinda happy. 

‚ÄúYou got another one of those?‚Äù

She hands me her pack, and I pull one out. I pull out a lighter and light it. I handed her pack back to her.

‚Äúthanks.‚Äù

I grunt as I exhale the smoke.

‚ÄúYou're welcome.‚Äù

We both stand there for a weird amount of time without talking. I break the silence.

‚ÄúSo, uh want my number? Since we're buddies now it'll just be easier.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

She hands me her phone and I put in my number. 

‚ÄúIt was my first night too.‚Äù

I mumbled out. The cold air stinging my lips as I breathe out to speak. 

‚ÄúIt was? Why are you here? By choice or‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got court ordered to. Two hours down forty eight to go.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds rough. Don't worry I'll make it easy for you.‚Äù

She smiles cutely. I blush slightly from her reply. 

‚ÄúDon't worry about it, I can handle it.‚Äù

With that I put out the cigarette with my boot, and I said goodbye. 

Now let's fast forward to the next week since nothing of real importance happened. She didn't call, or text besides one text about half a week in. She just said that the twelve step program was helping her. I'm glad that this program actually does help people who want to quit get over their dependency with alcohol. I go into the next week with a renewed sense of vigor. I have someone counting on me to get them where they need to be. I walk in about five minutes early, the usual suspects are walking in, some are getting what I'm assuming to be a cup of motor oil. I look around the room for Evelyn. And there I saw her, in the same seat she was in before. I walk up to sit down next to her.

‚ÄúHow ya doin‚Äô?‚Äù 

She turns around, and I see a different woman. Not physically, but there is this light in her eyes that wasn't there before. 

‚ÄúYeah I'm great! My migraines even went away!‚Äù

She says beaming ear to ear.

‚ÄúHey that's great Evelyn! I'm happy to hear that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can't wait for the third step!‚Äù

She says it in a frantic tone. I thought at the time that she was just extremely motivated for self improvement, but now I'm not so sure.

The group sits down, and the group leader holds out the talking stick. Its neon colors are an utter eyesore. 

‚Äúwho wants to start first?‚Äù

Evelyn perks her hand up first with alarming speed that only I seem to have noticed.

‚ÄúI would love to start.‚Äù

The group leader smiles and hands her the talking stick

‚ÄúI'm so happy to see you doing so much better Evelyn.‚Äù

Evelyn grabs the stick with both hands. Her knuckles are turning white.

‚ÄúHi Evelyn here, I've been sober for one week, and I have to be honest I've never felt better! I need to know what the third step is.‚Äù

She passes the stick to the group leader as quickly as her hands would allow. The group leader takes it without regard to those twitchy movements. Was he trying to be polite? 

‚ÄúThe third step is to give yourself over to that God, utterly and completely.‚Äù

She closes her eyes and smiles hard. I thought this was insane. How is everyone just accepting this without even a grimace?

The rest of the group goes on as normal, I barely got my hours in with how distracted I was from that whole thing. When it finished I tried to just head to the bus stop. When Evelyn shows up from around the corner.

‚ÄúHey buddy! Where ya goin‚Äô?‚Äù

I put on a facsimile of a smile even though I felt a growing unease with her presence. 

‚ÄúOh I'm heading to the bus stop to go home.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can drive you!‚Äù

She says with that same grin, that light I once saw turned into a glint of madness with the way she was bending and moving like she was doing ballet moves while getting ready to play a round of football.

‚ÄúN-No I'm fine. Thanks though.""

I'm ashamed to admit it as a six foot man that weighs 215 pounds but this petite woman is scaring me. And there was no way I was going to let that woman know where I live. 

‚ÄúAw, why not? I just wanna show my buddy how much I care about them.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I'm fine, I like the walk home. It's really nice out tonight.‚Äù 

The smile twitches for a moment as she holds her eye contact.

‚ÄúWell if you insist!‚Äù

She snaps back to being animated again. 

‚ÄúGet home safe buddy.‚Äù

This is where we're caught up with the story. The next meeting is in a couple of days, and Evelyne just messaged me that she's embraced the third step. I'm not sure if being free is worth it.

1g6sumr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Informal_Effect/comments/1g6sumr/taste/,Taste,"We meet in the morning in spring. Walking through the Farmer‚Äôs Market enjoying the fresh flowers. You put your hand on the small of my back as we walk and I lay my head on your shoulder. You pick out a bouquet of peonies and confederate jasmine for me. I thank you with a kiss. Your lips taste like coffee and croissants, strong and buttery. Barely sweetened, but rich in depth.

We meet at night in the summer on a hill in a field, lightning bugs flickering all around us. Your hands are on my waist as we dance to the sound of night critters. I pause and breathe you in, then I kiss you. Your kiss tastes smoky and dark, like bourbon and barbecue and sunshine. Smooth and slightly bitter, oak and char.

In the autumn we meet in the early afternoon, in the park, on a bench under a ginkgo tree. The leaves have started to fall and the sun is beginning to set. You walk up and hand me a cupcake as you sit. You kiss me happy birthday after you light the candle. You taste like vanilla and cream, sweet and light, warm and cozy.

We meet in the winter in the shelves of the library, snow melting in our hair. This time you push me against the rows of books, one hand on each side of my head, holding me in place and kissing me deeply. Your lips taste like hot chocolate. Marshmallows and cinnamon, and cold like ice. 

They are incredibly simple, all these flavors. But they combine to form the most intoxicating recipe of delight. Constantly changing based on season or mood or situation, but always, always you. ",4,1729285961.0,Informal_Effect,0,1.0,False

Once I fell asleep on the couch and dreamt of rats. I woke up and there were rats undulating on the floor. I got so scared and farted. I swear if I had to go to the bathroom it would have been right then and there, lol. Thankfully it was just air. As soon as that happened the rats turned into gray smoke and dissipated. I chalked it up as just a bad dream. Then recently I was asleep on my couch and my husband called me. I answered the phone admittedly a bit groggy. I was speaking to him ten minutes into the conversation when I noticed a toy on my coffee table and wondered why that would be here. I grabbed it and all of a sudden I saw sparks coming out of the side of my hand. I immediately let it go scared it was going to blow up and heard a bang then smoke again. It sounded like a fire cracker party favor like the ones with the little pull string.  I asked my husband if he heard an explosion. He said he heard nothing. So my question is could these be considered manifestations or just really bad dreams that I carried into reality for a split second? I seriously felt like I was losing my grip on reality but I don't know how to categorize these occurrences. Does anyone have any ideas as to what they are or maybe I'm just clinical. 
Btw when it comes to dreams I tend to remember every detail. I've also had lucid dreams for which I can't control when I have them. Neither of these occurrences could be categorized  as lucid in opinion.  Does anyone have any ideas? Any assistance is good assistance. ",1,1729285798.0,lawofattraction,0,1.0,False

1g6ssa5,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex_stories_adult_hot/comments/1g6ssa5/my_girl_contd/,My girl (cont.‚Äôd),"So, after my girl gave me head while 2 guys watched from the deck (she didn‚Äôt see them), she got up and went into the kitchen to wash up.  The lights were on and blinds were up, but she didn‚Äôt care.  In fact, when she came back into the living room, she sat on the couch facing the windows, and put her feet on the coffee table, then slowly opened her legs‚Ä¶ I started kissing her and running my fingers over her body.  I opened her robe to access her blouse goodies, sucking her right nipple while fingering her.  She started rubbing her clit as I was rubbing her G-spot.  Then we heard the loud boots again! My girl looked out the window to see these two guys looking in.  But instead of freaking out, Her pussy got wetter than I‚Äôve ever felt it before!  Then she whispered ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs two guys watching us‚Äù.  She said.
‚ÄúOh yeah, they were checking out Your pussy earlier while you blew me.‚Äù, I added nonchalantly.
‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù, she asked.
‚ÄúYup, but I didn‚Äôt want to stop you so they watched the show!‚Äù
‚ÄúYou Asshole!, why didn‚Äôt you get my attention?‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôve got it now!‚Äù, I said.  Then I asked her, ‚ÄúWhat do you want to do?‚Äù
She leaned back, spread her legs even farther apart and said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs put on a show!‚Äù
Then she put her hand on the back of my head and guided me between her legs.  As I went down on her wetter than wet pussy, She maintained eye contact with the peepers as she played with her tits. After about 30 seconds she started grinding Her pussy into my face!  She was cumming and cumming, glazing my face with Her pussy.  When she was done she tapped the back of my head, the signal that she needed a break.
As I stood up I could hear their boots walking around back.  Then she had an idea‚Ä¶she grabbed my hand and we ran to the bedroom.  She told me to lay on the bed, as I did, she opened the blinds on the slider, unlocked it, and turned on the lights!
As I lay on the bed with wood, she stood at the end of the bed facing me with the slider behind her, then worked her way up to my cock!  As she put my hard as rock dick in her mouth!  She began working the shaft with her tongue and hands, while fondling my balls with the other hand.
Just as she was starting to deepthroat me, we heard the boots again!  They stopped at the slider where they got a close up view of my girls pussy!  I whispered to her, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got company!‚Äù With that, she pulled away from my cock, And crawled over me until her pussy was over my cock.  She grabbed my hard, veiny manhood and slowly slid down it, giving our neighbor‚Äôs the full view of me splitting Her pussy wide open!  She leaned close to my head and asked, ‚ÄúAre they still watching?‚Äù  I looked around her and, not only were they watching intently, but they were both jerking off! 
‚ÄúUhm, yup, I can say they have a vested interest in you!  Why not ride reverse Cowgirl!?
With that, she sat up, then without breaking contact, she spun around and as her legs were spread wide open with my cock still stuffing her, Her pussy flooded when she saw them masturbating! She began rubbing her clit feverishly as I held her hips and pumped her soaking wet cunt!  
Just as I was about to nut, my cock slipped out, and without missing a beat, she grabbed it and put it up her ass!  Still rubbing her clit she stared at these guys still jerking off until she started squirting!! She had only squirted once before doing a web cam show with another couple! 
I could feel her pussy expanding and contracting as she finished herself off!  Just then, the two guys took off again! 
She climbed off me, stood up butt naked, walked over to the slider and stood there for a beat until she saw something move in the next apartment!  This guy walked into a room next door, looked directly at me girl then pointed at her saying, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got another horny couple next door!‚Äù  My girl didn‚Äôt flinch, she slowly picked up her robe and slid it on.  
I sat up just as the neighbors wife came to their window, wearing a white lace corset with her nipples poking through the material! Then, they both waved at us as I scootched to the end of the bed.  My cock semi hard glistening from The pussy and ass juices on it.
My girl slowly lifted her arm‚Ä¶her robe still open with her bush in plain sight‚Ä¶ and waved back.  This was going to be a long night!

Supps is genuinely healthier (with no cost of quality) then pretty much any caffeine drink aside from black coffee on the market and it even has less caffeine then black coffee so your not gonna get addicted to it as easily. Not to mention it saves a lot on plastic waste and money.

 The soups on the other hand are a different story. It costs a lot more and may have less sodium but that's like saying celery is healthier then a burger because it has NOTHING but noodles and a flavor packet.

1g6sksf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AddictedtoADHDmeds/comments/1g6sksf/how_adderall_ruined_my_life/,How Adderall Ruined My Life,"TLDR: Started taking Adderall and abusing it. Switched to pressed pills. Took over 100 pressed meth pills a week for a year and became a big time drug dealer. It‚Äôs a long read and I‚Äôm sorry about that.

Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this. I‚Äôm not writing this for pity as all of the events are my own fault and nobody else‚Äôs. 

In 2018 I had gotten of out the US Marines and enrolled into school. I was so excited to start my new life outside the military. After 2 weeks of school I realized why I joined to begin with. I couldn‚Äôt focus, concentrate, take notes, or do anything. I tried an extra Adderall pill my cousin had and WOW it all changed. School became easy, I was getting straight A‚Äôs. I got tested and found out I do have severe ADHD and was prescribed 30mg XR. I took it as prescribed for a year and my life was great. I was doing 14 credits a semester, working 25 hrs a week, going to the gym 6 days a week and was in the most healthiest relation of my life. 

30mg started to ware off by the time I would go to work so my doctor prescribed me 60mg XR a day. This is when I started abusing the meds. I began taking 100mg of XR a day. Run out and deal with withdrawal until my next script which affected my school and relationship. I would skip school and work to snort 100mg of Adderall and do nothing. 

As Covid hit I wasn‚Äôt able to get my prescription anymore. I was withdrawing very hard and my cousins bf had extra Adderall and offered me 2 to help. These weren‚Äôt Adderall. I know what every phara grade stimulant looks like and these weren‚Äôt it. He said a guy makes them in his house. I was in so much pain I said whatever and took one. It hit way harder than Adderall and I fell in love immediately. I got the guys number and started buying 20 pressed pills a week.

Pressed pills are homemade pills that someone uses a pill press, fillers, and a drug to creat. Most popular being the Mbox 30 blue percs, Xanax, and 30mg Adderall. I didn‚Äôt know they were made of meth until later on and by then I didn‚Äôt even care. I ended up dropping out of school with a semester left and quitting my job to get high. I realized I only had $1,000 left in my account. All the while I‚Äôm hiding this from my gf. Who stuck by me through everything.

These meth pills changed my personality, emotions, everything. During Covid I wasn‚Äôt working and my gf was so during the day I would get so high I started sexting other girls. This went on for 2 months until my gf found out. She left that day. I just threw away a 2.5 yr relationship with a woman I loved more than myself. Who I bought an engagement ring for. I never had sex with anyother woman or met any in person but still cheating is cheating. This made me very depressed. I took 8 meth pills, 17 Lexapro and drank 9 beers. I attempted to self OD. I must‚Äôve texted someone because I woken on my floor to 4 cops and EMT. I was involuntarily admitted to a psych ward. I manipulated the doctor after 3 days to let me out to which I immediately went and bought pills. 

I realized I needed money, so I took out my last $1000. I bought a quarter pound of weed, 50 carts, and pressed pills. This quickly turned into me selling 5 pound of weed, 1000-2000 carts, 4 ounces of dabs, and 100 edibles every week. I started buying the pressed pills by the 100 because they were cheaper. By now I was eating 10 pressed pills a day. 2 when I woke up, after those hit I got outta bed and had 2 more with coffee. Then 2 more every 2-3 hrs. This went on for almost a year and a half. I was taking 100 pressed Adderall pills a week for over a year. I only stopped the pills because my connect started buying from someone else and they were MDMA and not meth. I went through the worst pain and withdrawal of my life. I didn‚Äôt feel normal until 6 months. I stopped selling completely and no longer sell anything. I had saved up $15,000 from selling and spent it in a year on pills. 

I‚Äôm still addicted to Adderall. I buy roughly 2-3 scripts a month. They have changed me in the worst way possible. Mentally, physically, emotionally. During that time I neglected my family for 2 yrs, lost my job, apartment, and the best relationship of my life. I keep trying to get sober but I can‚Äôt seem to stay sober. Life just seems so pointless. I no longer recognize myself, or like myself. Adderall can be a wonderful medication when used properly. When abused it can turn you into a whole different person. 

This is my story. Thank you for reading. There‚Äôs much more to this story so if you‚Äôre interested feel free to ask me any questions. If you also suffer from stimulant addiction just know you‚Äôre never alone. ",1,1729285123.0,AddictedtoADHDmeds,0,1.0,False

I love to laugh and make others laugh and I have a pretty sarcastic and dark sense of humor. I enjoy cooking and baking. Love sports, gaming and music. I usually choose comedies over anything else but do enjoy thrillers, true crime, creepy stories (no paranormal please)  sci-fi and fantasy. Love animals and have some pets of my own that you will no doubt be introduced to. I'm of the mindset it's never to late for a cup of coffee and that it can solve most any issue plaguing your day. I have a terrible sweet tooth that only seems to get worse the older I get. I'd choose cookies over cake any day of the week, unless it's ice cream cake, then it's a toss up.

They blocked me.,"I was dating a guy for about 3 months, talking almost every day (I'm terrible at responding and whenever I'm super burnt out, have a bad can't-get-out-of bad day or a hyperfocus session I forget my phone exists too). 

It was getting serious, we had ""the talk"", all was great. Until I went on a trip with my best friend for about a week (mid september) and when I came back he had just left for a 2 week family vacation. We had talked about this obviously, I knew he was leaving but we didn't talk much while I was on my trip and after I came back to reality getting back into routine was SUPER hard. I had millions of chores and it took me a week to just shower and unpack my bags, all while having to WFH too while making even more of a mess. Then it took me a couple more weeks to recover from that and catch up on the work I couldn't focus enough to do. 

Anyways, I'm ""back"" on my routine (of having a couple productive days a week) and I feel like I'm missing something... OH GOD I HAVE NOT ANSWERED ANY OF HIS TEXTS IN 2 WEEKS. I guess he thought I was ghosting him because he blocked me after a couple tries.

This is not the 1st time it happens either (this was a little more extreme though) but I have fucked up many relationships because I forget to *want* to meet up with them, I'm too tired or forget to text back. I genuinely enjoy getting to know these people (for the most part) but I always get the same ""I'm sorry I feel like you don't like me as much as I do as you don't seem interested"". I AM!!! But ""out of sight out of mind"", I don't feel the need to see them but if I hang out with them or if I were to randomly see them on the street I'd be the happiest person on earth.

Is this normal or am i just an asshole??? Am I too self-centered? I could only think about getting back into routine, showering, trying to do (very simple) tasks for myself, only person I talked to was the guy from the coffee shop next door. Not in a depressed way it was exactly what I wanted and needed.

I live in a different country from my friends and family and I think I have the same issue with them until I go back and see them face to face. If they need anything from me they just call because they know it takes me weeks sometimes. ",0,1729284695.0,adhdwomen,5,0.5,False

1g6s8c5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BenignExistence/comments/1g6s8c5/went_to_the_community_center_for_the_first_time/,Went to the community center for the first time,"I just moved to a city with a community center that has an ice rink! I thought that was the coolest. I‚Äôve always loved watching hockey but I‚Äôve never been ice skating before. 

I had nothing to do after school, so I went for a walk to the community center. It was a really lovely autumn evening. I saw a person reading a book on their porch. People were dropping their kids off at home, little kids in cartoon shirts. It made me sort of nostalgic. It‚Äôs weird to think I used to be that young, once. People were jogging, walking their dogs, walking together and laughing in their conversations. The sidewalks were lined with trees, sunlight coming through the leaves. I saw two squirrels, one running after the other. I wonder if they were playing, or had somewhere important to be. I picked up a couple pieces of trash on the walk to throw away. It just felt nice.

I dropped by the community center mostly on a whim to see if I could rent some skates. The woman at the front desk let me know they didn‚Äôt have public skating open, but told me their hours. Probably something I could‚Äôve checked first, but oh well. I apologized and wished her a nice day. I went to find somewhere to sit. 

I wanted to watch a horror movie, but there were a lot of little kids around, so I looked for a seat with a wall behind me. The only place was the bench by the doors to the rink. All the players were already on the ice, and the bench was empty, so I figured it was okay. I could see a third of the rink through the doors, so I glanced over to watch whenever they were at that end. It was nice.

I think the woman at the desk felt bad that I was watching the game after I couldn‚Äôt skate. She came over and told me that she‚Äôd cover me the next time I had a day off school and she was working. I knew I probably wouldn‚Äôt be back, since I don‚Äôt usually have this much free time, but I thanked her anyway. It made me really happy. Today felt grounding. No matter what‚Äôs going on in my mind or my life, there‚Äôs happiness and beauty going on in nature, and the world. And human kindness is alive and well. 

I want to do something kind for someone else today. Maybe I‚Äôll pay for someone‚Äôs coffee or something.",9,1729284187.0,BenignExistence,0,0.92,False

As she stood up, she slid her top on before turning around to look at the messy garage covered in days old gesse, oil, and mechanical parts from past inventions.

""I guess I could clean,"" she said nonchalantly as she reached for a broom that sat next to her desk only to stop when her stomach started to rumble, ""but first some food!""

With a cheeky grin, Danny walked over to the stairs that led into the house.

""Honey, I home,"" Danny said a few minutes later as she walked into the kitchen before throwing herself into one of the chairs sitting around the table. 

""I know,"" Nicky said with a sigh as he adjusted his glasses before turning around, ""I could hear from all the way down there.""

""It not my fault someone built this house on a top of a really big hill,"" she said as she wiped the sweat off her brow before looking over at Nicky to see him just standing there with his mouth wide open holding a plate.

""So, did you make me something to eat?"" She asked cheeky, causing Nicky to jump a little in shock.

""Oh yeah,"" Nicky said dumbly as he handed over a plate covered in tiny sandwiches, ""what was we talking about again?""

""About how hard it is to get around this place,"" Danny said as she took the plate, ""I mean, you should really think about putting in an elevator.""

""By the way,"" Danny continued as she pointed down to the sandwiches, ""I really love when you make these.""

""First, thanks,"" Nicky said as he sat down next to her to enjoy his coffee, ""and that would probably be great great, great uncle Thomas fault. He was always weird.""

""Really,"" Danny asked between bites, ""I thought your mom said he just found it?""

""Oh please,"" Nicky said with a dismissive wave of his hand, ""he was a wealthy carpenter, what kind of carpenter doesn't build his own house?""

""Oh yeah,"" she said, sitting back in her chair as they slowly drifted off into a comforting silence.

""Hey, wait a minute,"" Danny said a little bit later as she realized that it was only Nicky and her in the kitchen, ""where your brother?""

""Oh T.J,"" Nicky asked casually as he took a slip from his cup, ""I believe he explorering the basement with his best friend and his new girlfriend.""

""Really,"" Danny asked excitedly as she grabbed Nicky onto shoulder, ""does that mean what I think it does?""

""Yup,"" Nicky said with a gulps as Danny leaned in closer, ""we have the whole place to ourselves.""

""Great,"" she said with a smile as with one hand she started pulling Nicky towards the door while the hand carried a plate of sandwiches, ""let's go watch a movie in our room.""

Meanwhile, as Nicky and Danny were heading towards their room unknowingly to them, Thomas jounor was rubbing a blight red liquid between his  fingers.

Out of the blue, I saw on her ig story a post about a certain song that I enjoyed and caught up. We grabbed coffee to catch up, and we are very compatible: common intreast, life goals, insecurites, our past, etc. We're very open to each other.

Here the kicker, she has been in a relationship for a while 4 years. And recently, she broke up with her boyfriend (25M) , they were considering marriage and all. I know they had issues but I tried not to pry. 

A couple weeks after they broke up, she asked me on a date and we have been seeing each other for about 3 months now and are even planning to meet each other family during the holidays,

Now all her friends kinda hate me and blame me for ruining her relationship with her significant other. Granted, I do feel guilty. But I really can't imagine my life without this woman.

Yesterday, I was finally able to hit up a cafe that had been previouslly closed due to the CUPE Strikes around western. I took a short trip down to [Black Walnut Bakery Cafe](https://blackwalnutbakerycafe.com/), the one [located ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Mph1vPNtLQmxBZ7B9)inside the Western Research Parks building right off Windermere.

When I heard about this cafe popping up in this location I was honestly quite excited - I thought having a nice cafe close by was an excellent idea, and then I just never found myself visiting due to not wanting to drive that short of a distance, but also never remebering to walk there on my free time. Well that all changed now that I can make a quick run of it with my bike as they have a nice little bicycle rack right outfront of the doors. This area is also isolated enough from the rest of the town where I have no fear of my bike being stolen as well... as it is really just Western students and researchers kicking around! So bikability is excellent at least for me - for others who arent in and around the Western Area its a decent detour from the TVP with no bike friendly roads to get you there!

Photography wise - On the buildings there is some neat glass/mirror action that a better photographer could take advantage of. A little up the hill there is the [Windermere Manor Hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hdBQb6VzvPQDEqGT8) which is beautiful, but honestly I couldnt tell if it was boarded up or still open! The historic [Elsie Perrin Williams Estate](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C18NkiPkzLG4Sqky8) is also just a few pedals further up the road which is always beautiful, and leads you down to some nice [hiking paths](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n7GDndPKbya89x4K8)!

They do not have Cortado listed on their Coffee Menu - but just ask and they will make you one! Their cortado was $3.35 and was pretty good! They used their Old South Espresso Blend and I would consider picking up a bag (if i didnt already grab [Rabbit Hole's El Volcancito Roast](https://www.rabbitholeroasters.com/products/el-volcancito) from [Dough EV](https://doughev.com/)!). Deffintely surpassed my expectation just based on the fact that the Cafe looks like they just cut a small hole in the wall (is very much a take and go version of the cafe compared to the standalone on Richmond).  I would diffently come back for a cup! Their Macaroni Salad was also quite tasty :)

Also I think I have been to enough Cafe's around town to establish my own rankings... ALL MY OWN OPINION and will deffintely change thought this whole process! Coffee Quality is #1 factor but others do play a part (price and bikeability for example).

1g6rtcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsReadOfficial/comments/1g6rtcv/a_catfish_avoided_cautionary_tale/,A Catfish avoided - cautionary tale,"So I have to wind up and give a little background here. I‚Äôm a guy who‚Äôs used dating apps to little to no success for the last 8 years. Why do I keep using them? Cos I find it hard to meet people situationally and I have ever since I was a kid though it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm trying to get better at.

Another thing about me is that I love scary story channels, and have for the last 8 years. And of the ones I‚Äôve listened to, the Catfishing stories always have had a strong effect on me. I‚Äôve never been catfished, however I had one time where I had the option put in front of me and I thankfully stood on business.

So, I‚Äôm a guy from London bordering on Kent in England, if that makes any sense. And this story happened back in 2016, when I was 22. I am a guy that is best described as decently looking without being a knockout. I‚Äôm slightly above average height, slim built white dude with black and blue eyes, basically one of thousands. And on Tinder, I matched with a girl who we will call ‚ÄúJess‚Äù - though as the title suggests, this may not be her name or may not even BE a her.
Jess was tanned, brunette with strong dark eyes and a chest you‚Äôd want to bury your face in. And the conversation went thick and fast - suspiciously quick when you think about it now. I was having a day off from working in Retail so I had an excuse, but it was 2 in the afternoon and she said she had a office role; and she was rapid firing these lines out. Then the point came where she‚Äôs suggesting meeting up that day, and I receptive to it because, as said, she was stunning and I simply wasn‚Äôt.
Now, the location said that she lived in a town a mere 3 miles away and an easy bus journey, so I said that sounds good. I started Googling coffee shops in area and picked one to suggest a first meeting. Jess says that she doesn‚Äôt really do coffee dates, and suggested instead meeting up somewhere more private and sent me the location.
The location in question, according to Google Maps, was a farm house off the track from the Motorway that you had to walk to get it.

Now, if you‚Äôre wondering what happened next. If I went over there big smiles and hoped for the best, I didn‚Äôt. I said outright that we should go for coffee FIRST to check and see we‚Äôre compatible and not make rash decisions. And Jess, the more I insisted, got more and more forceful into this farmhouse meet. She then ended with the following line:
‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt come to this spot, you won‚Äôt be having sex tonight‚Äù
And I responded fairly quickly with the logical retort made fully with the acceptance that this was someone with sinister intentions. I simply replied:
‚ÄúWell neither will you‚Äù
Following on from this, ‚ÄúJess‚Äù unmatched me.

Now, I wanted to share this story because I had the benefit of in this situation being slightly older and being very set on how I would meet people off Tinder or Bumble: be in public, be in the open. These tactics could very well have worked on someone younger who may have seen the warning signs but were thinking with their wrong head let‚Äôs say.

To anyone reading this, I‚Äôve got a simple message. Dating is hard, and online is even harder than real life. But remember that if the warning signs are there, that no matter how nice the photos are, how nice the face is, how ample the chest looks or how plump the rump is, just remember this one thing: it‚Äôs not worth your life.",2,1729283078.0,LetsReadOfficial,0,1.0,False

1g6rqwh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g6rqwh,the repetition of gangstalking ,"the targeted individuals forced in this program will constantly be placed in an uncompromising position.  the majority of the time the reason for that is due to looped recorded messages played in your left ear for hours on end until your subconscious mind decides to take a time out. this is when they will begin to navigate you in ways that suit the mindless men who are forcing this all
on to you.  this process is called subliminal hypnosis. 

the hypnosis you may be familiar with is that of an illusion shown 
on entertainment brackets such as magic shows, talk shows and bachelorette parties. this variety of hypnosis is sadly just an act. then there is therapeutic hypnosis, where a patient might seek out the help of a therapist or psychotherapist, who is a specialist in neurological pathways and hypnotic triggers of the mind. the kind that help you to quit smoking for example.  what a targeted individual is inflicted with is subliminal covert hypnosis. 

subliminal covert hypnosis is used to convince your brain subconsciously of a multitude of things. The individuals doing this to you will use a tactic that is a hypnotic suggestion, causing you to be more combative than you normally would be in your regular life. as in normally a group of morons calling you names all day demanding that you lie for them so they can feel better about their own crimes and the fact that they are only comfortable when there is no truth present.  chances are if this was happening to you to your face. You probably just walk away because we all know who the bigger person is here. but their main goal isn't a matter of getting truth out of you getting a lie out of you. They don't care about any of them. They just need to keep you strong along for as long as possible while they continuously siphon data from you to use for black market data brokers.  they will however repeat the same things both consciously and subconsciously to you, but one of those subconscious suggestions is telling you to do something that you ordinarily wouldn't do while the conscious suggestion is telling you to not do that thing because conflicting commands to the brain cause the individual to go into neural shut down or slip into madness. 

they will try to challenge the you that you have worked hard to be because they don't care about hard work. they have no place in society what so ever. they don't leave the place they live and work from. they work on schedules for 48 hours at a time fueled with meth and coffee, trying to convince innocent people to do drugs and have sex with their shareholders who come to town in droves. using hypnosis to navigate you from you're daily tasks to whatever their agendas are. they will try to live vicariously through you because they have nothing. they are chemically castrated when this begins to have them hyper fixate on the target instead of sex.  then these men want to convince a target that they are powerful?  you let another man convince you to give the use of your testicular function away because they used lies and manipulation to convince you of knights and sacrifice. these men don't know what they are professing to know. they just repeat the same 5 things over and over in hopes that they can drive you crazy enough to advance to the next check list item on their list of mind control.  speaking of list, there is 4 things that must be present to make their program work.

isolation 

trauma

meanwhile as they do this targets 24/7 are trying to convince a target they are slaves and at fault for what's happening.  while they are the real slaves here and the target is the asset in which they are mining data from. 

side note: if you want to know how and when this hypnotic suggestion begins to take hold... you will notice a sense of painlessness.. everything will look very outlined and detailed... and you will in a sense feel in aware and capable but another is barriers around you to navigate away from the forced navigation you are having forced on you. 

think about a snap back to reality.  say to your self ""123 out"" or crack your neck... these neuro reminders will help lurch you out of the overtaking and remind you of who's really in control, you.  

it's all audio based psyops broadcasted attacks.  meaning there is no lasers, no bearing things in to your brain. all of this repetitive terrorist stolen military psyops is heard. through the ear canal. wether it's something you have been told by them to know or something you have learned otherwise by knowing that every thing they tell you is a lie.  

i know a number of my posts may have the same information within them. this is because it's the correct information. there is one million americans who have come forward over the decades this has been happening.  proving in them with the appropriate information is my only agenda here.

1g6rqdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/askportland/comments/1g6rqdo/how_often_do_people_split_the_bill_on_first_dates/,How often do people split the bill on first dates in Portland?,"And if it's the ""the person who ask, pays"" that is the general rule in Portland, how often to ladies actually ask guys out in this city?

Asking because I'm an egalitarian type of guy myself. I prefer ""cheap"" first dates like coffee, going to a park, going to a community even together, hitting a nature trail, etc. If we go out somewhere that cost more than a few bucks, I would prefer to split the bill (in other words, quite similar to Nordic way). 

As a guy, from first glance, quite a few east coast cities may seem ideal because there are noticeably more women than men looking for dates (NYC, Philly, DC, etc.), however quite few of them will actually do the asking out and many will feel offended if you suggest to split the bill.

Just wondering if Portland was the same or not.",0,1729282858.0,askportland,40,0.35,False

I was vegetarian for about 9 yrs and am now vegan for about 6 and my diet is primarily rice, random veggies and spices, i dont buy a lot of processed stuff and i cook most of meals since im frugal

&#x200B;

My meals are mostly boring but sometimes i might actually use a recipe to make some curry, a vegan dip or something

I never had alcohol, drugs, weed, etc; and no coffee

Im frugal so i stick to water for the most part, rarely i will have juice/ soda

I have and do consume kombucha and non alcohol ginger beer but i guess i consume some slight alcohol just not enough to get intoxicated or buzzed, but again im frugal so its not something that i consume often

Basically the things i am making now i have been making for the past 5 yrs and about 6 mth ago my GERD returned

I have an adjustable bed for about 8 yrs so im at a permanent incline

1g6rjp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1g6rjp1/i_believe_in_love_do_you_why_do_you_believe_in/,I believe in love. do you? why do you believe in love? ,"I'm just putting this out there. mostly for me to read later, I think. Also because I have a quiet hope/suspicion that maybe someone else needs to read it, too, and it shouldn't sit in my google docs along with other random stuff I've written. I know I'm young. And a lot of people have said, yknow, that being a romantic fades and life hits you and ""fairytale love"" doesn't really exist. But I'm not even talking about fairytale love. I believe in love, real, flawed, beautiful love. because I have to, because we have to -

and because: I argued with my friend yesterday about something small and stupid, and she said it was late and we'd talk in the morning. then she said love you so much, don't stay up too late. And in the morning we worked out the misunderstanding. I recently made a friend online and it feels like I've known her all my life. she said today that I make her feel safe. we've promised each other that we'll meet for Christmas in nyc, one day, because that's her dream. My cat crawled under the covers last night because the fall chill is starting to set in. she purred so loudly I woke up.(she's now sitting on my keyboard trying to stop me from typing.)

I went to a coffee shop a couple weeks ago, just to do some work and have a change of place. I saw a family with two kids come in and get huge milkshakes and the kids played tic tac toe while their parents were talking. And then later, a twenty-sm couple on a date, and the guy ordered for both of them, and she was so happy that he knew/guessed her order. my grandmother's house has an old photo album with my parents' wedding pictures, and my mom was flipping through it for hours when we visited earlier this year. my parents are older now, and definitely don't go on ""dates"" or anything, but sometimes randomly they talk for hours and hours, and I'll come downstairs to get water at 12 or 1 and they'll be laughing on the couch watching YouTube shorts. I mentioned in passing how this'll be my last halloween at home before I leave for college, and my mom almost cried.

My granddad's cat is dying and he's been feeding him smushed up corn because apparently he likes that. random people I haven't talked to in years sometimes like the same cute instagram reels and I have a sudden feeling that we're all so much the same. on the topic of reels, one popped up on my homepage recently of a couple getting married next to a waterfall I hiked to with my dad when I was in first or second grade, and my dad carried my tiny backpack because I changed my mind about it about 20 mins in. And also my shoes, because I wanted to walk in the stream. there's a woman on YouTube who does cake decoration, sometimes with her husband. and every time I watch their videos, how much they love each other literally radiates off the screen. (the icing artist, she's so funny too.)

hands seem to be made to fit together. have you ever seen the ripples waves leave on the wet sand? people write stories and other people highlight the lines that stir something in them and other people run their fingers over the highlighted lines and feel closer to someone they love. a few months ago, almost everyone was out sick and there were only three people in my biology class. so the teacher started asking us what we planned to major in and what we thought about the future. then we asked what her major was. She said she did a masters in microbiology but now she's working as a part time teacher because she wanted a less stressful job, so she could spend time with her husband and daughter. she grew up in an abusive house, and she said she wants her daughter to feel loved. and that she ran away from home after high school because her family didn't want her to get an education, and her then bf (now husband) let her live with him while she studied. one of my cousins just got married to a white guy and he's learning our language so they can teach it to their kids together. did you see the video of Alex warren's wedding vows? yeah. I believe in love. I hope I'm able to create some, too.

1g6rijo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TNPLE/comments/1g6rijo/i_did_not_make_it_yet/,I did not make it YET,"I did not make it YET.

Some of my friends did and I'm SOOO happy for them.

I was praying the rosary and my last request was that if I do not make it, I hope God gives me peace and an open heart to accept it. 

I was about to sleep when the results came out, and I did not see my name on the list. And I am grateful that I felt light and only a bit sad that I didn't pass.

My worry was how I would tell my parents and my grandparents, who are very excited for me to get my license. (as a 1st gen doctor hehe) I didn't want them to wake up in the morning and look for my name only to not see it.

At around 3am, I went out of my room to get water and my mom and lola were outside. I didn't want to cry but I couldn't help it, I really didn't want to disappoint them. I said sorry I failed. My mom hugged me and said it was okay, my lola too. They know I did my best, and said I could try again. I told them I'd have to enroll again and they'll have to spend again. But they said it wasn't a problem, and for now, they want me to just rest.

To everyone else who didn't make it YET either, let's rest muna mga Doc. Maybe cry and be sad a bit. Tapos laban ulit.
We all spent hours studying, drank loads of coffee and felt so much anxiety. We all did our best. And that's all that matters.

We will make it, in God's time üôèüèª

1g6rhm5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g6rhm5,Update on my girl‚Äôs $500 Yaris,"Some of you might remember I posted a $500 Yaris I got which I decided to sell to my girlfriend at cost. 

Well here is the final product! I 3-stepped the paint, replaced brakes on all 4 corners and replaced the two rear struts. I paid to get the interior cleaned because I couldn‚Äôt be bothered to vacuum and shampoo the seats and flooring. I ran a deodorizing spray through the vents as well. I also detailed her engine bay and cleaned around all jambs. 

In addition, I changed her engine filter and cabin filter. The cabin filter had two literal coffee cups of filth stuck in it and underneath in the fan. It looked like a mouse or something was nesting there? There isn‚Äôt an animal now though but maybe at some point? After removing the filter the real smell of the venting system came through which prompted me to deodorize the car. 

The car feels totally different now and honestly if you didn‚Äôt know better you might even think it‚Äôs new!! ",20,1729282212.0,yaris,3,1.0,False
