1horemp,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1horemp/will_a_new_grinder_solve_my_problems/,Will a new grinder solve my problems?,"I have the Timemore C2 right now, which I upgraded to from the Hario Slim, and I’m planning on getting an 1Zpresso K-Ultra. The way my setup is now, I have a difficult time making coffee that tastes good, but I can do it sometimes. Meanwhile, I absolutely love the taste of the pourovers from my local coffee shop, and some of the coffees that they brew are coffees that they sell in bags that I take home.

I once got a bitter cup by brewing a C2-ground coffee with 95C water, so I switched to 94C, but that ended up tasting maybe underextracted (I'm not the best at tasting.) Then I tried bumping up the extraction by agitating the bloom with some more swirling, but that gave me inconsistent results. I didn't try grinding a click finer and I probably should have, but it seems like I need some serious precision in order to hone this grinder's potential, and I'd like it to be easier.

When people talk about the K-Ultra, they mention how it's exceptionally easy to dial in with, and that leads me to think that I won't have to try as hard to get good-tasting coffee. I'd also assume that the grind quality itself would exceed the C2, and I may get cups that I enjoy similarly to the drip coffee that I drink at my local cafe.

Some additional information about my brewing:

- I just use filtered tap water. Using mineral packets with distilled water sounds expensive
- I use a ceramic 02 V60 with James Hoffmann's Ultimate V60 technique, 30g to 500ml. He uses a Wilfa Uniform(?) in the video, which may be considerably better than the C2. Perhaps other people with cheap grinders have issues with this technique too, but I wouldn't know which technique to switch to
- My temperature-controlled kettle has a gooseneck spout. It's the Bonavita one
- I use the slow-feed hand grinder technique that I learned from Lance Hedrick where you hold the grinder at an angle",1,1735459328.0,JamesHoffmann,0,1.0,False

1horebl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1horebl/aita_for_not_leaving_my_boyfriend_because_my_mum/,Aita for not leaving my boyfriend because my mum wants me to,"
So, I (18F) have been with my boyfriend (18M) for about a year and a half now, and honestly, we’re super in love. Like, I’ve never felt this way about anyone before. He’s so sweet to me, always doing little things to show he cares, like leaving me cute notes or making me my favorite coffee before school. We spend almost every weekend together, binge-watching our favorite shows, going on walks, or just talking about our future. I can’t imagine being with anyone else.

The thing is, my mum really doesn’t like him. She’s never really approved of him from the start, but recently she’s been bringing it up more and more. The main thing she doesn’t like is that he’s going to art college. She says it’s not a “real” career, and that he’ll never be able to make money or have a stable future. She thinks he’s ""wasting his time"" because he’s not doing something practical like getting into business or science, and it honestly makes me feel like she doesn’t respect what he’s passionate about.

My boyfriend, for the record, is so supportive of me and my dreams. He always listens to me talk about my goals and encourages me to chase them, no matter what. He’s actually really driven when it comes to his art—he’s been working on his portfolio for months and has even started selling some of his pieces. His work is amazing, and he’s talked about eventually opening his own gallery or becoming a freelance artist, which I think is so cool. But my mum doesn’t see it that way. She says it’s unrealistic, and that I’ll regret being with someone who doesn’t have a “serious” career plan.

A few days ago, my mum pulled me aside and asked if I was really happy with him. She said she was worried about me and that I needed to ""think about my future."" Then, she flat out told me I should break up with him because, in her words, “he’s never going to be able to support you.” She made it clear that if I didn’t end things, she wouldn’t be able to support our relationship anymore, and she was really upset about it. I tried explaining how much he means to me and how good he is to me, but she just kept saying that I deserve someone who has more “stability” and that art won’t pay the bills.

Honestly, I feel like she’s being so unfair. She doesn’t get how much he loves me and how happy he makes me. We have so much fun together. Like, we’re always laughing, having deep conversations, and making plans for the future. He’s always there for me when I need him, whether it’s for support with school or just to listen when I’m upset. He’s kind and thoughtful, and I feel like he really gets me. I’ve never felt more secure in a relationship before, and I don’t think I should throw that away just because my mum doesn’t think he has the “right” career.

I know my mum just wants what’s best for me, and I get that. She’s worried that I’ll be settling for someone who isn’t going to be able to give me the life she thinks I deserve. But I really don’t think she understands how happy he makes me. I feel like she’s trying to control my life by pushing me to break up with him, and I don’t think that’s fair. 

So, AITA for not breaking up with my boyfriend when my mum asked me to? I know she’s upset, but I really don’t want to lose him.",2,1735459295.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

Today I confronted my therapist about an aspect that keeps bothering me for quite some time: her texting during therapy sessions. At the begging I said to myself: ok, it happens. Then this started to happen more and more frequently. Last time she spent a lot of minutes texting ( helping her son with a school project ) and I mentioned that I can’t concentrate while she’s looking at her phone, but she said: “go on, I’m listening to you”. I waited for her to finish and then I continued. Then again. And again. And again. 

Today she said: “oh, I need to write to my cleaning lady “ and took her phone again. I completely shut down and when she asked me what happened I confronted her by telling that I don’t like at all when she’s using her phone for non-emergency situations and I don’t find this behavior acceptable with any other person I have a conversation. She became very defensive and accused me of not being able to focus in any situation and maybe I should work on this “issue”. I was in shock and told her I strony disagree with her point of vue. Then she changed strategy and kind of made me feel guilty because I want her attention 100% and accused me of calling her son a not so important person. Then she explained that our relationship is like any other relationship ( where both parts respect and support each other ) and I didn’t support her when she needed my understanding with her son texting for help - and she said that maybe that’s a highlight and a common issue in all my relations. Then she suggested that perhaps I’m bothered as well by the fact that she goes to toilet or bringing some more coffee - which is not the case obviously. 

I should mention that she helped me in some difficult periods of my life and she was like a true friend when I needed most : after giving birth she was the only non family adult / female friend that I interacted with. She also acted like a friend I never had: asking me to borrow her clothes ( at first it seemed awkward but I was to shy to refuse ) or asking for perfumes I don’t wear anymore. I appreciate she helped me whenever I had a crisis by phone or texting.  


I have no idea how to handle everything. It’s funny because one of the therapy subjects was my fear to confront other people. ",1,1735459216.0,therapy,2,1.0,False

We meetup in a neutral place, prolly a coffee shop or a resto na easily accessible(pwede sa town or malapit lang sa town). Kain/coffee with chikahan abt ourselves. We do this to see if we physically/mentally/emotionally vibe.

Afterwards we go back to my place para manuod ng something or we can wine and talk abt deeper things abt our lives. Afterwards freshen up tayo then i can lend u some of my clothes na pambahay para pareho tayong bagong ligo and bagong damit kasi nga galing tayong labas and kumain/nagkape/uminom and mas masarap magtabi syempre pag parehong clean. 

Then we can just sleep and enjoy each other's warmth. Or we can do whatever the moment sparks up. And importante ay we are comfortable with each other.

Then after we wake up, we have somebreakfast(i make a mean old scrambled eggs) and then we discuss how we'd move forward. We can part ways no hard feelings, or we can stay in contact depending on how we felt with each other during our time together.

End.

We should appreciate the people who are there to help us, and if no one is there, appreciate ourselves for being able to get back to our daily lives without a seizure knocking us out for good. During all of my seizures, even on the side of the road when almost stepping on the bus, someone has been there to help.

This one was at work, on lunch:

I am 80% sure this is because I haven't had enough water lately. Like half a bottle a day in the past week, if that. I keep drinking more coffee than water. A very bad habit I've had for a few years.

I was on my lunch break, had the tiniest aura ever, and fell face-first, again, on the *concrete* in front of my coworker, on the back porch. This time, I only busted my lip and my cheek. My entire face didn't swell because I only fell on the left side. Just like I asked, no one called the ambulance. Thank goodness ❤️

I think the right people were on the clock, and I wish I could afford a gift to say thank you. My boss would not let me stay at the register by myself, and the other two coworkers kept hanging clothes/tidying stuff up at a visible distance across the floor, something I didn't think they needed to do but I understand why. Customers come in and see someone's face beat up and think they should call the cops.

Boss filed an ""incident report"" I guess so I couldn't sue them but I don't even have enough money to pay $100 ER copay without going into my savings.

For some reason though, I can't ever catch my seizures. I was sitting on one of those park benches drilled into the ground, which is not good support for falling over. There's no arm rest.

I want to buy a car but I have not made enough progress yet. *I have made progress, and my medicine is working* just not enough, especially with learning how to take care of myself.

TLDR: Maybe think about the progress you've made. How far are the gaps in your seizures since you've changed your lifestyle? And we don't need to go buying them gift cards, but we should still say thank you.",1,1735458943.0,Epilepsy,0,1.0,False
1horai1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1horai1,"Failed Upgrade, Successful downgrade ","TL:DR:  intel arc 310 works out the box with dragon scale 24.xx. Just use the plex app and select the gpu at the bottom to 1 gpu. Restart the app and on the web app go to transcoding and select hardware transcode drop down look for your gpu

Hello all. Been running trueNas for a hot minute.  Last february I bought this hp DL320e v2 for cheap. I mean 75$ cheap with free shipping to AK. Had what i needed at the time. 2 LFF in the front. 1 sata for boot drive. 

Boot its 512gb ssd on the sata port for the cd drive with a mini sata to sata converter cable and 2 12tb HDD on mirror. 

Today after waiting a month for an intel ARC310 gpu. This thing finally arrived. I was stoked to install it on the nas so i can transcode without killing my cpu (1280v3). 

After looking around I see that lots of people were having issues with intel card on Dragonfish 24.04.2 and above. So i got into the idea of updating to Electric ell and boy o boy. I was in for a good one. 

After using the gui to change train to electric ell. The download started and my heart beat started going up. Server failed to start so i had an idea as this server has done something similar on the past. Shut down. Remove the 2 hhd. Reboot wait for the 2 beeps and slam the drives back in. After a good 30 min wait with coffee in hand and high blood pressure. Server came back online. 

MISSING HALF OF THE CONFIGURATIONS.  

Pools were missing. No apps. No anything just the users and thats about it. 

Could not import the pools. So cli it was. Using zpool import (poolname) did the trick. But said way to many issues been found. I did not wanted to loose my data as the gui and cli were telling me that all data will be lost if i tried to continue (resilvering on the cli) (new pool on gui cause trying to add to pool was not working and importing button was showing nothing)

I was like dang.. what now. I have done way to many adjustments to make plex work(smb share, datasets pools. 8tb of data). So i remeber i downloaded the config file. When ahead and uploaded that file to the general section. Reboot. And…. Nothing. Back to square one on Electric ell.

So i went ahead and found my old boot on the boot section and wala! Everything back at it was. But not happy because my brand new intel card internet said was almost impossible or hard to make work on dragon scale.  

So. At this point i was a little frustrated because i wanted that gpu to work but because i read all that junk from the internet i did not try it by my self. 

I went ahead and run LSPCI on the shell. Card showed up. That gave me hope. Went into the plex app and edited and saw at the bottom gpu use but nothing showed up. Restart the server and that did show up on the app!!! Selected for intel gpu 1 gpu. Restart the plex app. Went into transcoding and found my intel gpu!!! Found something to watch and transcoding is happening!!!  

That upgrade scare me shitless. So for now no upgrades to truenas. Until something can be figured out out to smoothly transition",2,1735458888.0,truenas,0,1.0,False
1horac6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1horac6/theres_something_out_there_underneath_the_ice_pt_2/,There's something out there underneath the ice [pt. 2],"With enough determination, I reached him. He stood still as a corpse, staring down at the ground. He was dressed in gear similar to mine, his own colored a shade of orange. But after so long in the storm, it had all been frosted white. An anatomically correct snowman. 

Usually, you can tell when a person is breathing because of the fog around their mouth, but there was no mist with Edvard. No indication of life until I grabbed his shoulder. Then, he turned towards me, his face concealed beneath a pair of goggles and a thick balaclava. 

""Come on!"" I yelled. ""You're going to freeze to death out here!"" 

Somehow, in spite of the wind or the sound of my beating heart, I heard Edvard speak. A frail, breathless whisper: ""I was here."" 

We didn't have time to stand around talking. Every second out there was another second closer to hypothermia. 

I pulled him away, back towards my Snow Cat. Edvard's feet stumbled against the ground, somewhat walking but mostly dragging. I forced him into the passenger seat and unhooked myself from the anchor rope. With the click of button, it retracted onto the reel. 

Climbing into the driver's seat, I closed the door and cranked the heat as high as it would go. I was exhausted. Felt as if I'd just finished a marathon. Really, we traveled less than a mile. 

Sliding the goggles from my eyes, I wiped the sweat and tears away before taking hold of the control levers. We started for my cabin. Along the way, I radioed the others to let them know what happened. 

""Is he alright?"" Mia asked. 

""What the hell was he doing?"" said Donovan. 

""I've got him, safe and sound. That's all that matters right now,"" I said. ""I'll get back to you once were at the cabin."" Then, I turned off the radio to focus on the drive. 

The storm was picking up, smearing the landscape into a swirl of white. Antarctica could be a beautiful place if you ignored the cold. Glittering stretches of open terrain. An endless sky that sometimes was blue as the ocean or red as a fire. Pink in the early morning, maybe a shade of purple late at night with soft tinges of vibrant green. But most of the time, especially in the winter months, it was black. Dark as the bottom of the sea. 

In that moment, I felt a sense of nostalgia for my first week at the research station. Long before I had become inured to the boredom and treacherous nature of the artic. 

In a strange way, perhaps even in a nonsensical, inexplicable way, I had felt like an astronaut. As if I were exploring what few had seen before. A lone lifeform adrift in the barren void of space. Special. Not because of who I was or what I could do, but because of what I was in relation to my environment. An odd entity that was somewhere it wasn't meant to be. A flower in the desert, a heartbeat amongst the dead. 

That feeling quickly abandoned me during my second or third week. When my sense of awe was combatted by the long hours of doing nothing, trapped inside my cabin for hours on end. 

""Where are we?"" Edvard asked. 

""We''re heading back to my cabin."" 

He reached up and pulled the fur-lined hood from his head, peeled the goggles from his eyes, tugged the balaclava down around his neck. Edvard was a handsome man in his early thirties. Tan skin that had taken a softer tone from his time in the artic, time spent away from the sunlight. A hard jawline with cheeks stippled by the makings of a beard. Thick, tangled hair sat on his head. Brown as oakwood. Drenched from sweat and snow into a darker shade than usual. 

The first thing I'd noticed about Edvard when we first met were his eyes. Glacial blue and intense. The kind that were easy to get lost in if you weren't careful. Always watching, observing, assessing every minute detail. 

We sometimes joked that he was a reptile because we never saw him blink. And at first, it might seem disquieting, off-putting to the average person, but you quickly adjust to it, to him, because beneath that severity, beneath that intense gaze was a profound warmth. Kindness. Selflessness. Intellect that went beyond amassed knowledge to a deep, unfathomable grasp of empathy. Of emotions and compassion. 

If it weren't already apparent, I admired Edvard. Found his gentleness, his genuine nature, commendable. Especially during a period of time when society's norms did not always condone such behaviors. 

Furtively, though, I was also envious of him. Jealous to a caustic degree. He had somehow figured out the secret to happiness. Had discovered the path to not only fulfillment, but a level of content that I would never achieve no matter how great my aspirations or ahcievements. 

To put it simply, I woke up every morning intent on working to earn my paycheck like everybody else. Edvard, though, awoke with the sole purpose of enlightening himself. No grandiose expectations. No incessant grind in search of monetary success. He lived and breath for the sole purpose of experience. To do the best he could, and at the end of the day, properly acknowledge his efforts regardless of the results. 

Maybe that's why I had been so surprised to hear Edvard say: ""You should've left me out there."" 

""What?"" 

""You should've left me in the ice, out in the storm."" 

""You would've froze. I'm surprised you're still alive, Ed. You'll be lucky if you don't contract anything serious."" 

""I'm already sick."" 

""Probably because you were standing in the middle of a snowstorm! What in God's name were you thinking?"" 

Edvard turned towards me then. That faraway look in his eyes. ""There was someone out there."" 

""You're imagining things. There's no one out here but us."" 

""They're out there!"" 

""No one is out there. The company would've told us if they were bringing anyone in."" 

The cold was making me irritable. I wanted nothing more than to get back, take a hot bath, and drink some hot chocolate. Maybe play another game of chess with Donovan if he was willing to lose again. Or listen to music while watching the snowfall. I was an avid fan of Low Roar. Their music was oddly redolent of the artic. Morbidly beautiful. Haunting and surreal. 

""It's just us, Ed."" 

He didn't seem convinced, but he said nothing more of the matter and leaned back in his seat, closing his eyes. ""I've got a headache."" 

""We'll get you some aspirin when we get back."" 

Gently, he massaged his temples as if to work the kink from his brain. ""Thank you, Emily."" 

I hated when people called me by the wrong name, but Edvard wasn't in a state of mind to be scolded or reprimanded. 

""I'll keep you overnight to monitor your status,"" I said, ""and assuming you haven't developed hypothermia by then, I'll take you back home in the morning. Maybe Donovan will help me retrieve your Snow Cat at some point."" 

Edvard showed no interest in the current subject, and instead, said: ""I had a dream about you last night."" 

I scoffed. ""For both our sakes, don't tell Mia that."" 

""You were dancing at the center of the sun,"" Edvard added. ""I think you were laughing. Even as the inferno swallowed you whole, you looked as if you were laughing."" 

I blinked. The silence between us swelled, combated only by the sound of the wind as it thrashed the metal exterior of the Snow Cat. 

""Maybe we should just let this be a time of silent reflection,"" I suggested. ""Take a moment to really think before we speak."" 

Surprisingly, this made Edvard laugh. A subtle gradual thing that soon filled the inner cabin of the Snow Cat. 

""If nothing else,"" he said, ""you're funnier than...than me."" 

I shook my head in disbelief. ""Thanks. Glad to see the cabin fever has completely turned you mad."" 

Again, he croaked with laughter. A small, humored chuckle that sat in his throat like the call of a toad. 

""Humor is a good trait to possess,"" he told me. ""From what I have surmised, the general population appreciates good humor over almost anything else. They find it charismatic, endearing."" 

The cold had corroded his brain, left him in a detached state trying to distance hiself from the trauma, from the harsh reality. From the realization that he had faced the distinct possibility of death not twenty minutes prior. 

I wasn't going to burst that bubble, wasn't going to ruin his methods for coping. ""Ed, I think that is avery astute conclusion. 

This seemed to invoke some semblance of joy within him. A hint of pride for his meager assessment. 

When we finally reached my cabin, I killed the Snow Cat's engine and climbed out from the cab. I lagged behind, allowing Edvard to pass me and enter the cabin first, convinced that he might try to run away if I weren't there to block him. 

But now that I was with him, that he was no longer alone with his thoughts, he seemed cooperative, compliant. More so than usual. 

Edvard was the unofficial leader of our little group. The spokesman for the skeleton crew. He ordered our supplies and reported to the company whenever they reached out, which wasn't often since most were away for the holiday. 

He didn't have any real authority, not like our actual superiors. He couldn't orders us about or terminate our positions or anything like that. But he'd been taking on some of the responsibilities the rest of us wished to avoid, and for that, we were all grateful. Maybe that had been affecting him. Maybe that's what had driven him out into the storm. The surmounted pressures and additional stress coupled with the inevitable madness provoked by isolation, by a lack of sunlight and exercise. 

I would've asked him about it, not that he necessarily would've admitted this, but I was bone-cold and exhausted. I didn't want to have a serious conversation then. Didn't want to deal with the burden of truth. I just wanted to call it a night, to relax. 

So, I ran a hot shower and let Edvard wash up first. I threw his clothes into laundry and started cooking tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches for dinner. Then, I radioed the others to give them an update. They had more questions than I had answers. I told them what little I knew and promised to give any updates if I found out more. An empty promise as I had no inclination to dig deeper into the matter. 

Edvard was an adult. Fully capable of making his own decisions and choices. If he wanted to talk, I was more than willing to listen. But in my mind, the last thing I would have wanted at a time like this was someone else poking and prodding, dissecting my every thought and decision as if I were no more than a hapless child. 

That didn't mean I wasn't going to keep an eye on him. He was in my cabin, and therefore, under my supervision. Until I felt comfortable enough with his current state of well-being, I wasn't going to let him leave. 

Some people might think I was being completely ignorant or stupid, and maybe I was to some degree, but I would tell those people you weren't there. You don't know Edvard like I do. Not that we're exactly close, but we've all been working together for the better part of a year. Forced to spend almost every day within close proximity. 

It's not like we just clocked out at the end of the workday. Not like we could go to the bar on the weekends. If we wanted to socialize, it was with each other. If we wanted to play games or share a drink or have a movie night, there were only so many people we could do that with. Friendship or not, we were victims of circumstance. Animals sharing the same exhibit. 

You either learned to appreciate the company of the other twenty-five individuals around you, or you spent all your time locked inside your cabin slowly losing your mind. 

At this point, I'd had more conversations with Edvard or Donovan or Mia or any of the other twenty-three analysts than I'd had with my actual friends, possibly even certain members of my family. We were more than familiar with each other. 

Edvard was whimsical, but he wasn't an idiot. He wasn't crazy or insane or anything like that. He was fully self-aware, more cognizant than ninety percent of the people I'd encountered throughout my life. And from what I could tell, he wasn’t seem depressed. Wasn't displaying negative behavior to lead me to suspect that he had gone out into the storm with the intention of dying. 

""I don't know,"" he had admitted between bites of his grilled cheese. About half of his tomato soup still remained, wafting little streams of mist into the air. ""I just...I really thought someone was out there. I would've put all my money on it. Every last dollar."" 

""And your first instinct was to go after them?"" 

""I didn't want them to freeze."" He took another bite and chewed. ""I mean, didn't you do the same thing for me?"" 

""That's different. I was almost certain you were out there. The transmitter even said so."" 

""Still. There was a slight chance that I wasn't."" 

""I guess."" 

""But you went out there anyway."" 

""Alright, Ed, you've convinced me. Next time I notice you're miles from your cabin in the middle of a snowstorm, I'll just leave you be."" 

He laughed. ""That's not what I'm getting at."" 

""What are you getting at then?"" 

He contemplated this as he chewed, going back and forth between his sandwich and soup until neither remained. 

""Human nature is self-destrucrive at its core,"" he finally said. ""They're...we're...it's practically intrinsic to do anything in our power to help another member of the species without any regard for our own well-being."" 

I looked at him for a long time without saying anything. Bemused by his statement, stupefied even. Then, when I did speak, I told him: ""You have severely misinterpreted the human nature if that's what you believe."" 

""Oh? Is that so? Enlighten me."" 

""Gladly."" I set my sandwich on the plate and leaned back in my seat. ""Have I ever told you about my father?"" 

He wracked his brain for a memory that I already knew didn't exist. 

""He was a good person,"" I explained. ""Served in the army for about seven and a half years. Honorably discharged due to mental concerns. Spent the rest of his life working minimum wage at a steel mill during the week. Nighttime security gigs a bar downtown on the weekends. 

""One day,"" I told him, ""he just dies. Heart failure. No warnings really. He was overweight and had been a smoker in his younger days, but other than that, fit as a fiddle."" 

""Okay?"" 

""Well, we didn't have much money growing up. We were just above the poverty line. So, as you might imagine, we struggled to pay the funeral charges. It's expensive to properly dispose of a body. Whether you cremate or bury."" 

""What did you do?"" 

""We went to the VA, but they weren't going to cover it. Started a fundraiser, online and in-person. That helped. People donated, more than I expected, but at the end of the day, my family was still stuck with a substantial bill. One that we are still paying, and it's been almost three years."" 

Edvard frowned. ""I'm not fully grasping--"" 

""The point is, there are good people and bad people. Two sides to every coin. But self-destructive, in a selfess sacrificial way, I don't think so."" I pushed my plate away. My appetite had abandoned me. ""There's a reason humanity still exists while other species go extinct. We're hard-wired for survival. Our sense of self-preservation is greater than our innate emotional response to the condition of others."" 

""You think people should have donated more? Until they had nothing left to give?"" 

""Not at all. I don't hold a grudge, I don't have any grievances. Hell, I'd probably do the same thing they did in given circumstances. But if our empathy is as great as you are wont to believe, we wouldn't have struggled in the least to pay for my father's funeral. There wouldn't be homelessness or poverty or starving nations. Society wouldn't completely break at the first sight of a pandemic. But these things do exist, they happen because we're self-centered...most of us, at least. We worry about number one and hope number two or three or four never come knocking on our door in search of help."" 

""Then why did you come out looking for...me?"" 

""I don't know. I just couldn't stand the idea of a coworker, a friend, being out there. Left alone like that."" 

""Maybe you don't give the human race enough credit."" 

""Or maybe I'm just an idiot lacking the necessity for self-preservation."" 

""I don't know about that."" He smiled then. A gentle pull at the right corner of his lips. ""I possess enough knowledge, sufficient memories and experience to know that humanity can be full of destruction and hostility, but there's still compassion out there. Enough altruism to deem worthwhile. It's a species worth protecting, one worth being apart of. Don't you think?"" 

I scoffed. The conversation was absurd, but the question itself was beyond ridiculous. Not exactly what I expected that night. 

It was commonplace to discuss politics or literature. Pop culture and movies. Weekend plans or outings with the family. The sanctity of humanity, the value of society, that just wasn't what a popular topic. 

""I think it's getting late,"" I said. ""I think we're too tired to be discussing ethical dilemmas or analyzing human nature."" 

He put his hands up in surrender. ""Alright, fine. But let me ask you one last thing, and I'll leave it alone: what makes a person? What standards qualify someone as a human being?"" 

""Easy, they know when to drop a conversation."" I retrieved my dishes and carried them over to the sink. ""Looks like you've still got some learning to do."" 

""I guess so."" 

We cleaned up after dinner. I washed and he dried. Then, while Edvard looked through my collection of books and board games, I took a shower. The water was warm and thawed the cold from my body, melted away the stress that had pulled my muscles taut. Helped clear the fuzz from my mind. 

When I stepped out, I found Edvard waiting for me in the doorway of the bathroom. I don't know how long he'd been there, but the moment caught us both by surprise. 

""What the hell are you doing?"" I remarked. 

He lifted his hand, holding up a book for me to see, a casual expression over his face as if I hadn't caught him watching me shower. It might sound stupid, but his nonchalance made any internal alarms go silent. As if it were a misunderstanding. Bad timing kind of scenario. 

""Can I borrow this?"" he asked, holding out my father's copy of Thomas Ligotti's 'The Conspiracy Against the Human Race' on display. 

""Uh...sure."" I waited a moment, towel pressed around my body, before asking: ""You mind getting out so I can change?"" 

He looked around, a reddish hue flooding his cheeks. ""Right, sorry. Yeah. Just one of those days."" He backed out of the bathroom. ""Again, sorry. Completely inappropriate of me."" 

Once the door was closed, I swapped my towel for a pair of checkered pajama bottoms and a plain gray sweatshirt. Cotton polymer that was softer than any pillow or cloud in existence. I'd bought the set about two Christmases prior, and let me be the first to say, it was one of my best purchases ever. 

The small things in life are sometimes the most fruitful. Little pleasures to make the rest no more than a distant memory. That greasy fast food takeout after a long day at work. That cup of coco after spending the morning shoveling your driveway. A tub of cookie dough ice cream after getting dumped by the only girl you ever loved. Brief moments of reprieve from reality. Distractions to keep your sanity intact. Comfort in the simplest forms. 

Edvard was sat on the couch reading my father's book when I finally came out of the bathroom. He glanced at me and offered a soft smile. A strange way to clear the air, but for the life of me, I couldn't think of a better alternative. I'm sure one existed, but at the time, I was still in an awkward mindset of whether I should be upset, pissed, ashamed, or mortified. 

""I'm going to put the kettle on,"" I said. ""You want a cup of tea?"" 

""Tea?"" 

""Crushed leaves and hot water."" 

He chuckled. ""I know what tea is..."" He pondered a moment. ""Is it any good?"" 

""You've never had tea before?"" 

""No, yeah, I have, but what kind?"" 

""I've got Sleepytime Vanilla, peppermint, and Throat Coat."" I checked the cabinet. ""I've also got homebrew coffee and hot chocolate with marshmallows."" 

The variety in choice seemed to confuse him. ""Uh..."" 

""Is that an answer?"" 

Again, that warm, crooked smile. ""You know better than me. I'll let you decide."" 

I filled the kettle with water and set it on the burner. Then, I went to my rig to perform the nightly check in. 

Mia was getting ready for bed. It seemed a little early, but lately, she'd been lying in bed for hours on end, unable to fall asleep. Her theory was that if she lied down around eight or nine at night, she might be asleep by ten or eleven. 

Donovan was in the middle of a Studio Ghibli marathon. He'd been watching 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind' when I radioed in. For those that don't know Donovan, the last thing you wanted to do was interrupt him during a movie. 

So, I skipped the niceties and any attempt at conversation. Told them I would check back in the morning. I wanted to mention Edvard, talk about the way he was acting, the things he'd been saying, but like with Donovan and Oscar, it was hard to broach the matter with him in the same room, listening to our conversation. 

After recording temperatures, weather conditions, and seismic activity, I muted my systems and grabbed the kettle from the stove. I poured a cup of Sleeptyime Vanilla for myself and Throat Coat for Edvard. 

When I came into the living room, Edvard dog-eared his current page and looked up at me. ""Can I ask you something?"" 

""Depends,"" I said, ""what's it about?"" 

""You're father."" 

""You can ask, but I can't promise to give an answer."" 

""Fair enough, all things considered."" 

I set the Throat Coat on the coffee table in front of him and took a seat in my desk chair at the other end of the room. 

""Alright, shoot,"" I said. 

""Shoot?"" 

""Figure of speech, Ed. Never knew you to be so literal."" 

He tittered and shrugged helplessly. ""Like I said, weird day. Feeling a bit off. Like I've just awoken from a dream."" 

""I know that feeling. Sort of like deja vu."" 

His brow knitted with uncertainty. ""I guess so, yeah."" He set the book on the cushion beside him and took his mug by the handle, lifting it to his lips. 

""Wiat a minute, that's--"" 

But he was already gulping it down. Wisps of steam masked his face as he emptied the mug. Then, he set it back on the coffee table and exhaled. 

""Nevermind,"" I muttered. ""Guess you don't really need tastebuds anyway."" 

I blew on my coco before taking a drink. I don't know how he didn't react because I practically scorched the interior of my mouth with just one sip. 

""Anyways,"" I said, stifling a scream, ""you had a question about my father?"" 

""Right."" He nodded. ""I was going to ask if you missed him."" 

""Of course. It'd be a crime not to."" 

""Would it?"" 

""Another figure of speech, Ed. Seriously, whats going on with you?"" 

""No, no. I understand. I just mean, what if I didn't miss my own father."" 

""I wasn't aware your father had passed."" 

He pursed his lips, forming a firm line across his mouth. ""Both of my parents...actually
They...uh...they died in a car accident."" 

I couldn't help the shocked expression on my face. Edvard was so vibrant and optimistic. Hard to imagine he had ever experienced any serious trauma. But that's just the way some people coped. Turn to the positive and leave the past behind. Let your shadow follow at your heels instead of plaguing your mind. 

""I don't really feel much of anything about their deaths,"" he confessed. ""Shouldn't I, though?"" 

""Well, when did it happen?"" 

""I was a child. They were coming back from a date, and I was stuck at home with the babysitter. A young neighbor girl from across the hall. 

""I remember hearing the police sirens from down the road,"" he recalled. ""When I looked out the window, I could see the lights flashing in the distance. I felt...helpless. Trapped. I don't know how I knew it was them, I just did. But now, I don't feel anything. It's like I'm watching that moment on TV. Like it was someone's life."" 

""I'm not a psychologist, but it sounds like you're still in shock."" 

He shook his head. ""No. I remember being in shock at the time. I don't know what this is."" 

""You can be in shock more than once. Some realities take years to set in, and it's not like you experience it once and it's done. These things come in waves. 

""Some days..."" I paused, wondering if this was something I wanted to share with him. Something I wanted to share with anybody. ""Some days, I get up and get out of bed like anybody else. I feel fine, normal. Just go through the motions and that's that. But then there are days when I might hear a certain song or watch a certain movie or read a certain book, and it feels like I've lost my father for the first time again. Like I'm back in that moment when my brother called to tell me..."" 

Edvard stared at me, wide-eyed and completely enthralled. As if we were sharing ghost stories around the campfire. 

""It comes and goes,"" I finished. ""You don't ever stop grieving, you just learn to carry that weight. To manage it so that it doesn't crush you."" 

""What if you could forget it?"" he asked. ""Lose those memories. Would you?"" 

That was a tough question. Well, I suppose the question itself wasn't harder than any other question, but the answer was complicated. Difficult to put into words, to explain outside of just feeling it. 

""I'm not sure, honestly,"" I said. ""I mean, thats why people drink or smoke or take pills or whatever. Because they want to distract themselves, want to forget their pain. But I don't think you can. Not without causing more issues for yourself."" 

""You'll have to expound on that a little more for me."" 

""Life isn't a steak. You can't just cut away the fatty bits. I wish you could, and I suppose some people really do try, but in my experience, it just doesn't work like that. It's a package deal. You get the good with the bad. Trying to eliminate that, to cut out the parts you don't like or enjoy, it'll hurt you as a person. It would completely erase any tolerance for pain and leave you with unrealistic expectations. You wouldn't really be yourself if you removed the memories you didn't want."" 

""To suffer is a better alternative?"" 

""To suffer is to be human. Just like with love and hate, joy and anger. We have to experience all those emotions at some point or another, otherwise we become blind to reality. 

""But I get where you're coming from,"" I admitted. ""I've been there. So overwhelmed by your grief that you almost finding yourself wishing you don't exist. That you weren't real because then, you wouldn't have to feel anything at all. All that heartbreak, all that confusion and madness just fades away if you aren't there to indulge it. It becomes illusory."" 

Edvard leaned back, resting his chin in between his forefinger and thumb. He seemed utterly confused. 

""It's been a long day,"" I told Edvard. ""Let's just call it an early night. Try to get some sleep and clear our heads."" 

Silently, he nodded. 

I retrieved an extra set of pillows and blankets from the closet. I offered to sleep on the couch, but Edvard refused. He'd already taken the better half of my day with his antics. He didn't want to put me out any further by taking my bed too. I didn't put up much of a fight on that front, I was too tired. 

I turned out the lights and climbed beneath the covers. It took me a while to fall asleep. Partially because my brain wouldn't shut down. That's been a problem since childhood. Even when my body was on the brink of collapse, my mind stayed active. 

But also, I wanted to wait until Edvard had fallen asleep. Not that he would have done anything, not that I didn't feel safe around him, but there was just this feeling I had. I didn't know what it was, but I couldn't allow myself to go to bed until I knew he was sleeping first. 

That eventually came when I heard his soft snores sneaking through the dark. Then, and only then, did I close my eyes and relax. 

It probably comes as no surprise that I dreamt of my father that night. I was outside, caught in the middle of an icestorm. There was nothing around me for miles. Empty fields laden with snow. Endless hills rolling in the distance like the gentle peeks of ebbing ocean waves. The sky was pitch-black. No sun, no moon, no stars. Just a blank void of darkness. 

I could hear my father calling out to me. It'd been so long since I heard his voice, but even then, I could tell that it wasn't him. It was a guttural sound. Sharp and grating, but inexplicably, I was convinced that it was my father. The way that dream logic makes no rational sense, but you accept it as fact anyways. 

I followed the voice through the storm until it came from directly beneath me. Then, I fell to my knees and started digging. I didn't have a shovel or gloves or any equipment. So, I dug with my bare hands. 

My fingers went from red to pale blue. My muscles ached and burned. But I kept digging, pushing away mound after mound of snow. I found his corpse buried beneath a thick wall of ice. Arms raised and hands poised as if trying to claw his way out. 

I blinked, and my father was replaced by Edvard. I blinked again, and this time, it was Donovan. Short black hair, and a thin mustache above his upper lip. Skin the color of milk. Then, it was Mia. Long, auburn-red hair and soft green eyes. Mouth partially open as if frozen mid-scream. 

Lifting my fist, I pounded on the ice, cracking the first layer with relative ease but struggling to break through anything deeper than that. 

The wind picked up. Snow pelted against me at an incredible speed, dragging across my flesh like the edge of a razor blade. 

When I blinked again, Mia was gone. Instead, it was me beneath the ice. A reflection interspersed by a spiderweb of cracks. 

I awoke with a lump in my throat, wanting to scream but unable. My lips were locked together. I was paralyzed. 

At my bedside, Edvard loomed over me. He had a blank gaze in his eyes, looking without seeing. A lantern absent of light.

""I am here,"" he said.",1,1735458870.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
1hor9mg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BariatricSurgery/comments/1hor9mg/a_message_of_hope_to_those_on_the_fence/,A message of hope to those on the fence,"This is a message to those who are hesitant of surgery because you think you'll never be able to change. Let me tell you what. This surgery changes things for you. I had a lap band installed over a decade ago. It wasn't successful. Lost weight initially, but gained it all back plus some. It did nothing for my appetite or joy of snacking all day. Had it removed and a gastric bypass performed about 5 weeks ago. I'm a 5'8"", 46 year old guy. My weight before surgery was 280 lbs. I loved sugar and caffeine. Loved to graze. Wouldn't eat huge meals (couldn't with the band), but I could easily eat a few thousand calories a day grazing. Fast food. Junk at my office at work. Junk after the family went to bed at night. You name it.

I seriously thought this surgery would be a failure. That I would be a failure and just not be able to control myself afterwards even with the surgery. That couldn't be further from the truth. It was a rough 3 weeks or so after surgery. Not going to lie. I had massive regret. Couldn't drink enough fluids. Couldn't get enough protein. Couldn't stomach the chewable vitamins. Then things started getting better. A LOT better. I'm now able to drink without it killing me and I'm able to eat solid food. I've lost 35 lbs.

I used to work construction and was always a strong guy. Been doing a desk job for a long time now and over the years I've gotten weak. At 280 I could barely get up and down off the ground. Have been having chronic knee, foot, and back pain. I'm at 245 and still have a long way to go, but I'm already feeling so much better. I worked outside today hauling stuff off to our local landfill and putting together things that required me to get up and down off the ground over and over. I probably did 8 hours of this physical stuff today. Guess what? No knee, foot, or back trouble. Can't remember the last time I was able to do something physical like this without it being a real struggle and paying for it afterwards.

But the best part? I feel totally in control of my diet now. I thought that would never happen and that I'd be a slave to food until I died from something weight related. But I'm doing it. Me. The one with zero self control. If I can do this, SO CAN YOU!

I know I'm only 5 weeks out and people are going to say this is the honeymoon phase. I know it is. But for the first time in decades, I feel like fighting. I feel mentally prepared for the struggle I know is coming.

Oh, and the caffeine I mentioned? Gone. I've given it up. That's something I thought I'd never be able to say. Stopped drinking coffee and soft drinks a week or two before surgery and haven't gone back. Been water, Propel, milk, and sugar free Gatorade for almost 6 weeks. I'm totally weaned off the caffeine and the nearly daily Starbucks run I used to do doesn't interest me at all.

My advice: If you are putting surgery off because you don't think you'll be able to handle it, just go for it. You'll be a different person. You got this!

1hor75k,https://i.redd.it/l56dtk33tq9e1.jpeg,Can I create motion graphics on a tight budget?,"
1. ""A Million-Dollar Look on a Hundred-Dollar Budget""
So, you want motion graphics that look like they were made in a Hollywood studio but your wallet screams, ""Dollar store chic!"" Don’t worry; you’re not alone. Most of us have champagne taste and soda water budgets. But here’s the thing: with a little creativity and some elbow grease, you can create animations that make people say, ""Wow, how much did that cost?"" instead of, ""Oh, bless their heart.""


---

2. ""The Power of Free (Yes, Free!) Tools""
Let me introduce you to a magical place called the internet. It’s filled with free tools that can help you create motion graphics without selling your kidneys. Heard of Blender? It’s a free 3D animation tool that’s so powerful, you might forget it didn’t cost you a cent. And then there’s Canva—perfect for basic animations. Seriously, the only thing cheaper than these tools is using crayons and a flipbook.


---

3. ""Stock Footage: The Great Equalizer""
Don’t have the budget for custom assets? Stock footage is here to save the day! Websites like Pexels and Pixabay offer free animations and videos. Need a dancing banana or dramatic lightning strike? Chances are, someone’s already made it for you. Just grab, tweak, and voila—instant production value! It’s like borrowing sugar from a neighbor, except they’ll never know.


---

4. ""DIY Like a Motion Graphics MacGyver""
Remember when you thought duct tape could fix anything? Well, in the world of budget motion graphics, creativity is your duct tape. Can’t afford high-end plugins? Find free presets. Need sound effects? Record your own—your cat knocking over a glass can double as ""explosion.wav."" Your resourcefulness will shock people. They’ll think, ""They must’ve spent a fortune,"" when really, you just spent an afternoon scavenging YouTube tutorials.


---

5. ""The Art of Compromise: Fancy but Frugal""
Here’s the truth bomb: on a budget, you won’t create Pixar-level animations, but you can still create something that wows your audience. Focus on clean designs, smooth transitions, and engaging storytelling. No one cares if it took $1,000 or $10 to make—if it’s good, it’s good. Just don’t forget to throw in a little self-deprecating humor about your budget. People love a scrappy underdog.


---

6. ""The ROI of a Little Hustle""
Creating motion graphics on a budget isn’t just about saving money; it’s about flexing those creative muscles. When you figure out how to make magic with limited resources, you set yourself apart. Plus, clients love a designer who can stretch a dollar further than a magician’s disappearing coin trick. The best part? When you finally have a big budget, you’ll know exactly how to make every penny count.


---

7. ""Your Budget Isn’t a Limit—It’s a Challenge""
In the end, working on a tight budget is like playing motion graphic Survivor: outwit, outplay, out-design. It forces you to get innovative, learn new tricks, and prove that you don’t need a bottomless wallet to create jaw-dropping visuals. And hey, when people ask, “How did you pull that off?” just smile and say, “Trade secret!”

So, what are you waiting for? Go make some graphics—and save some cash for coffee.

I never gave it much thought- probably just rats hiding out above in the walls.

That is- until I started finding the notes under them.

On plain paper, scribbled with a black crayon were the words,

Hello.

I smiled to myself and walked towards my husband, piling some sugar into his morning coffee.

“Okay, weird question,” I said, holding up the note. “Did you leave this under the mirror? It’s kinda... creepy.”

He glanced at the paper, and his brow furrowed. “No. Why would I do that?”

“Come on, Manuel. You’re the computer science guy. If you wanted to mess with me, I’d expect something, I don’t know, smarter?” I tried to keep my tone light, but the knot in my stomach tightened.

His face grew serious. “I didn’t leave that there. I don’t know where it came from.”

I laughed nervously. “So, what, you think a ghost wrote this?”

He didn’t respond. His silence unsettled me more than I cared to admit.

""This isn't a joke, manuel. Tell me the truth.""

After multiple attempts of convincing me, I gave in. We decided we would take action after another note or action from the stalker or prankster.

The day after this incident, I walk towards my dresser.

I step on something.

A note.

We see you.

I clearly wanted nothing of this bullcrap, and I made clear of that to my husband.

He still insisted he did NOT put that there, So me, still believing him to be the prankster, told him that we would go to the police station to report this.

He agreed.

I was a bit taken aback by this.

The police were not helpful at all as you can imagine- they insisted that there needs to be an ""evidence of a threat"" and it is the only way they can take action.

Frustrated and angry, I burst into my room and-

Another note.

I brandished at it, clutching it in my hands.

We want to escape.

I was so angry I shouted to the ceiling,

""Who the fuck are you? As far as I know, you are a pathetic little shit who's too scared to come out.""

For a long time, I stared at the mirror before me, clutching my note.

That's when I saw it.

I noticed a subtle- smile appearing on my reflection- subtle, but it was there.

Almost as if my reflection was- mocking me in a way.

In a state of utterless panic, I tried to change my emotion. I acted as if I was- sad.

The reflection still stood that way.

It didn't change, it didn't move.

Shivering now, I just wanted to get out of that room as fast as I could.

I stood up from the chair-

The reflection was still sitting.

I was fucking horrified.

I screamed for my husband, who came dashing into the room.

I told my husband all about this- ofcourse he didn't believe me- until he looked into the mirror as well.

Now, both of our reflections were standing now, and they had one of the most horrifying smiles plastered on their faces. I'll never be able to forget it.

Their mouths were warped in some way- almost cruelly- like in that movie 'smile.' it kept staring at us. I was done with this, I told my husband to go get a bat and to beat the living hell out of that mirror.

They just stood still.

Watching.

He started across the room, holding a bat in his hands. He thrust it onto the mirror-

Nothing.

Our reflections just kept staring at us.

I told my husband we were getting out of this house, pronto.

We locked our doors and we headed to our car.

Reaching it and getting into the car, I smashed the car door shut, when I noticed my husband was not getting in.

""What?"" I asked him.

He stood there, frozen. Again.

He was shaking.

The knot in my chest was beginning to tighten.

I got out of the car and made my way to his door when I saw those little motherfuckers staring back at us.

With that same smile.

Me and my husband ran towards the driveway and sat there for what seemed like eternity.

I entered the house again, alone this time.

My insides writhed like snakes- I couldn't give in to those things-whatever they might be. They can't take over and lock us out of our own house.

I made my way towards the mirror.

The mirror was broken.

The shards looked like there was something inside of them- something almost whirling in them.

On the floor, a note scribbled in black crayon as well,

 12mths sober but still so many health problems, basicallyvdisabled, its  spending 3rd Christmas alone my heart breaks , the reason it's like this is alcholol is what's done this, going from a caring mum for 9yrs to son his 11 now to a pathetic looser who became a alchololic and totally changed , can't understand but I Waa a beautiful caring mum that always took my son out for 9 yrs to this drinking  animal in last 3mths of living with ex of 22 yrs in house separated under 1 roof. Shame on me & couldn't get it together for 2yrs in 22, 23.

I feel totally helpless and distraught as to how &  why I got myself into this position,  anyone else spending it alone?

I've been to many drs gastroentolgist and endoscopy and other procedures,

 i need 4 more test which ive had a yr sgo to really get to the bottom of every thing and hopefully can get surgery,  poem or flouriscopic robotic surgery or fundoplication including fusion surgery in india as Australia is to expensive,  I cannot eat solids for 6mths so far and it's even worse I cannot do anything for Christmas.not thatci have for 2yrs due to been situated in shared house that was nice but not the best environment, Pretty much I've isolated myself for 12mths now anyway only going to drs and emergency departments but to spend  Christmas new yrs alone is going to be a kick in the teeth, anyone going to be spending it alone? Everything I eat I'm chewing and liquid goes into ny mouth while chewing and I try to swallow it down with all this liquid them it back flows back up so bizarre as I never had this problem, I don't even get bad reflux it's just motility of stomach osphogus gallbladder but it's 24 7 of hell!

Story is as kid mum couldn't cope she waa alchololic including her 7 brother sister all died cause alcoholism, she tried her best I lived with her till 12 but couldn't handle been there anymore rung dad come get me biggest mistake lived there 4 6yrs from yr 6 to yr 10 I was physically abused by her every day and locked up in my room most of time I remember she used to barg in and just pick fights with me for no reason and slap me across rhe face and hit me her brother one day ask me at family get together he knew thus was happening, Was close with nan dads mum, I had to walk to school everyday there and back for 3yrs with big school bag full of heavy books that was part of her punishment she would never let me socialize with friends occasionally I'd see the girl across road,  oct in yr 10 that left I made an escape plan I left went to friends house & never returned I Waa free at last, did formal with best friend, nan said u gotta come live with me, lived with her 4 7 yrs worked for 15yrs in Sydney 4yrs in city, met ex of 22yrs had great life bought house in Wollongong had son 2012 moved 2 Melbourne 2013 had great house life till 2022 then I blew it by drinking excessively already split with ex 9mths prior was ment to move out but anxiety got the better of ne stupidly drunk in car some days ex would catch me I'd be sleep sometimes how stupid was that, drinking so much losing everything moved into brothers had good life there 4 2mths, moved in nice shared house with 75yr old emphysema guy but he couldn't keep his hands off me few times moved out lived in car had no where 2 go drunk excessively I'm car for 2wks so could fall sleep, found a house that Was same situation with lease owner, he controlling & kept hitting on me, couldn't have anyone over I left there lived in car drunk excessively 4 3wks  met someone 2 times moved in with him for 3wks biggest mistake he physically assaulted me for cooking pasta in microwave and 4 drinking the coffee satchels the house was something out of a horror movie I couldn't take it I stayed in bedroom for 8days drinking excessively he stayed in lounge room it was most nightmare situation I made escape plan moved out when he wasn't there, never was I going to live with male against, I'm here with lady lease owner for 12mths now, no alcohol for 12mths but my whole life is ruined by alcholol use, would drink excessively 4 2mths or sometimes 1mth but drink red wine like it Waa tap water just cause I felt unsafe

I just don't understand why I have all these health problems now to point I can't function and pull my self together, remember thus time 2921, 20, 19, getting so excited for Christmas we would buy duck, chicken,  BBQ chicken,  for lunch, listen to music, to now 2022, 23,24 been worst yrs of my life, go figure,  there's not a fay goes by I wish I didn't wake up.

Anyone else have debilitating problems from alcholol use? 

What I can't understand is how can I be here in this situation when 4yrs ago I was driving to the beach every Sunday with my 6 yr old son sleeping in back seat of my car going to the beach with the ex and stopping for coffee and cake to this, how can alcholol do this to you basically make u disabled and dysfunctional? 

I can't sit on lounge to watch TV longer then 5mins, I can't breathe cause of this liquid that keeps coming why is this happening to me I'm 13mths sober, I'm so jealous of other people's lives

But the past few weeks I've experienced a range of symptoms, for example - one night I may get tired at the usual time (between 11-1am) but I will wake up during the night with my baby (4months) and sort him and I'll be up for hours and hours after that, this may be even from 2/3am.
As well as some nights I cannot get to sleep until 6 or 7 am after some real focus on relaxing.
I sometimes put this down to a nap during the day, even if I try to keep it to just 30-60 mins.
It's just all a bit of a mess right now. 
Stress wise, I do have a lot going on but I am coping, and I know I'm not awake because of stress, I feel fine, I'm just so awake. I eat fine, I drink very little caffeine, maybe 1 coffee every other day and that's only sometimes. I'm not on my phone am insane amount but admittedly I do put the TV if I just absolutely can't get to sleep. Plus, sometimes the sound of the TV at the lowest it can go, even if I'm not looking, can help.
Obviously sleeping is an issue with a baby but he's actually very easy during the night.

Sometime I miss those chill Sunday mornings where me and my partner would sit on the couch in our pyjamas for hours drinking coffee, reading the newspaper, talking, relaxing..

Now we have our sweet high-energy 2-year in the mix 😂

Do you still manage to have a chill Sunday morning? How do you do it?

Some things I do:
- get kiddo a plate with snacks (fruits, veggies, cheese,..), so I don't have to rush to do the actual breakfast, which is often more like brunch and later in the day
- don't care if kiddo stays in pyjamas for another hour or two
- turn on the baby monitor in the room, so kiddo can go play in their room if bored with us and I don't have to follow around
- prepare a pile of books and song books on the couch to make sitting with us more attractive

I don't know how seriously to react to his impatience, since I tend to be more of a go with the flow type (Libra F). 

For instance, recently we took a trip and I asked to stop to get a coffee at the train station. As soon as we got in the line, he started huffing and commenting on how slow the other customers and the barista were being, and generally exuding frustration. He's already doing a running comedy bit about how we will die in this line and have to be buried in the train station. Doing my Libra thing I want to restore the good vibes above all so I immediately say I don't need a coffee that bad, let's forget about it. But he looks at me like I've just said something crazy and tells me if I want a coffee of course he doesn't mind getting one. We got the coffee and everything was fine, it was all very lighthearted but it made me wonder.

This type of thing has happened before, where he expresses impatience but doesn't seem to want to fix the situation or receive any support. Is he just complaining for fun or is he genuinely pained by having to wait or take it slow? If you are an Aries who experience this kind of thing, what are you actually feeling, and how would you want your partner to respond?

Firstly, all women are named Jahnvi, khushi, Riya. Are these fake pseudonyms they are choosing for their own safety? Or are they the Adityas and Siddharths of women names? 

Also why are these women so demanding? I want food, I want a guy who is 6ft and feeds me, take me on long drives and to a good spot to eat, buy me flowers and dinner. All the prompts are directed towards the fact that they like to eat. Gharpe khaana nhi dete kya bhai 😭😭. The funny part is that if they do match with a guy from the plethora of options they have the first thing they will do is go to a restaurant or cafe to eat, so why beg for the obvious. Why is it okay to ask for stuff as a woman? Long drives, veins on hands, guy with glasses, food, flowers, coffee. Sometimes there are prompts and they are literally long lists of their requirements like bro wtf pehle baat toh karle.

No one's talking about their interests or themselves. All the prompts are either about what they want or complaining about what they don't want. And worse, championing the ordinary about them. I like to eat, I like to rot in bed, I like to yap. YAP? It's like they have learnt this new word and that's it, this is my personality now. I TALK A LOT, very interesting. So women like to eat, talk and sleep. What’s next they like to shit and breath? Bruh

See, I'm sure men are just as horrible on dating apps in different ways. But the mediocrity of women definitely needs to be talked about. As Bill Burr rightly once said ""Women are always patting themselves on the back for the most basic things and men don't stop them because they want to fuck them"". That's hinge summed up. 

Maybe because I am 22 and the women my age (19-24) don't have much going on for themselves it's pretty useless for me to be on a dating app. They are young, attractive and they just want to have fun with no efforts put in and that's okay. Plus despite of no efforts added they are getting what they want so why would they try to be interesting. Maybe when I grow up I might find people who are genuinely worth talking to. Or I might connect with a girl in person. But hinge is definitely not worth wasting time over. There's like 1 good profile for 30 similar ones.

You guys probably get posts like these but I have just deleted Hinge on a sunday afternoon and I am just venting here. This rant is a personal observation. I would love to hear what you men and women have gone through and any advice necessary. If this ain't a valid subreddit I will go elsewhere.

1hoqszo,https://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/1hoqszo/has_anyone_developed_a_system_for_doing_some/,"Has anyone developed a system for doing some specific things? If so, what?","And, I don’t necessarily mean systems for functionality. But seemingly trivial routines for seemingly trivial things. I’m not sure how to make this sense the way I want to mean. Have you found them accidentally or did you try to create the system? Or even, is there a hobby or interest that your life orients itself around and if so, what and how?

Do you have a specific routine for a seemingly menial thing that means a lot to you? A routine for something that society would say “isn’t beneficial”. A way of things you developed for yourself that would only make sense for yourself and have meaning for yourself because you and only you like this specific shade of magenta (or something).

I’m finding that this “developing my own personal way of doing something” is happening as I’m trying to locate what I find meaningful and interesting and expanding on those things. 

Or, quite simply, are there things you like a certain way, and what are they?

Here’s a recent and trivial example: I like to tab when I read books. I’ve done this for a long time but I’ve never had a system and the bookstagram way of doing it is so meticulous and effort-full. My “system” before was cutting out sticky tabs so they’d be thinner and in different colours but I didn’t like it either, and had random systems for this I didn’t like.

But earlier this week I mindlessly used the same colour for all my tabs because that’s the only colour I had and then somewhere during this I decided to cut the tabs in half and then accidentally created a specific system where I cut out enough tabs to fill a card and then I put that in the back of my book. I’m onto my second book with this system. It’s funny because this isn’t going to make me a Nobel prize winner or smth but it’s a system I have for something I enjoy. That’s what I mean. This is also specific to me because unlike bookstagram it doesn’t look as colourful but the end result looks oddly aesthetic to me and makes my brain feel satisfied.

This is such a trivial example ik. Haha. Laugh. But on a more grand scale I’m going through this process with other things, not in a deliberate way. Finding systems for doing things. Finding out I like things a certain way. I now have a way of making my coffee each morning that I didn’t do last year. I have realised I like the way knitted projects made with finer wool look. I didn’t think about knitting at all last year. I accidentally created my first lip combo recently that I’ve been wearing all the time since. And last year I didn’t care about make up at all; there are other accidental changes that have happened that I’ll keep to myself but overall not many…these small, menial things that make this year and last year look very very different from each other. And these changes made me realise that I CAN change my life and make things look different and better for myself in a matter of time, without trying to hard but as long as I’m open to trying something new once in a while.

And to be clear, I don’t mean deliberate self development or efficiency, but the “little things” that changed your life. 

P.S. I recently found that I like an oddly specific shade of magenta hence the mention above. Thanks for sticking around to the end of you did.",9,1735456776.0,simpleliving,7,0.91,False

I think it's due to my struggling finding a job after my master's and going long distance with my boyfriend which made me feel really lonely.

This month my bf and I are finally in the same city again and we've been spending a lot of time together. I can feel my anxiety slightly getting better every time I am next to him but sometimes a few things trigger me. What I didn't expect was even a few sips of iced coffee latte were enough to make me feel bad.

Yesterday I was at his place helping him to make something. There were also two of his friends who came to help. One of his friends suddenly had an idea to order iced coffee from a nearby coffee shop. He didn't ask if I wanted some but just ordered one for me. I felt bad for not drinking it, so I took a few sips. Before the sips, I was feeling really at peace (finally). I was next to my bf (who's like my comfort person), and there were his friends (one was actually a mutual friend who went to the same uni together) and we were kind of reminiscing some old tales from uni. I was feeling really good and in the moment. But after the coffee I could slowly feel my heart start to sink. I started feeling anxious and ruminating on some intrusive thoughts. Luckily, I decided to stop drinking it before it got worse. 

Later that night, after I got home I was trying to sleep but my heart was beating really fast, I was feeling restless, and I didn't know why. I was supposed to be tired after a long day. It took me a while to remember that I took a few sips of coffee earlier that day. I texted my bf about it and he really didn't understand how a few sips of coffee could make me feel like that. I've told him multiple times that I can't drink coffee or anything with too strong caffeine. He's huge coffee drinker, so he always thinks that a few sips shouldn't matter that much (he finished my coffee because I didn't want to drink the rest of it btw).

I called him but he's kinda busy, so we only talked a little bit. Luckily, it's enough to make me calm down a bit. Then I took 2 magnesium pills and only after that I could finally sleep.

I pretty much gave up coffee years ago because I realised how it makes me feel anxious and horrible. But sometimes it's hard to avoid it in social situations. If it were up to me, I would only drink matcha green tea, jasmine and chai.",1,1735456479.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False

Above and beyond most. Everyone (3kids, Mom&Brother, Uncle&Aunt) minimally tried for me, they barely show up for me when I’m always all out for them! For example my 50th birthday this year, now I wasn’t really expecting much, but I got Nothing, ok I got money just handed a gift card or cash, that I had to go to a place I didn’t want to be to get it, no Happy Birthday song, no cake or ice cream, and literally NO gifts to unwrap. Not even a, “We’ll cook or clean for you”! A few other friends from Facebook said HB but you know they get prompt & reminded to do that. Then there’s Xmas, granted my kids are still young adults, (26,22&18 2girls 1boy)for the last 5years in a row, I’ve got nearly nothing, my oldest daughter goes out and spends hundreds on her friends, BF, BFF, siblings and siblings significant others, and one stupid useless novelty item I neither want nor need. Like another shot glass (I don’t drink, at all, they do but I do not) or another coffee mug, (I also do not drink coffee) anyway the point is I didn’t get anything from anyone that was meaningful, thoughtful, needed, or even wanted! My own mother whom I am her dedicated caregiver and put up with more of her than anyone else, got me a $10. Ear probe with a camera to see the gunk in ears! Gross!! Other than that, a small votive candle and glow in the dark LPS (I don’t care for because it’s literally a child’s toy) just because it glows in a black light or in the dark whatever! Ya woohoo I spent almost $100. On each and that’s a lot for me as I’m a partially disabled single mom for over 18yrs single. Their dad is a deadbeat! I hate that they even talk to him because he doesn’t deserve to. And then there’s Mother’s Day, for my mom I make her whatever dinner she wants and something small she likes, for me I get hand me down, nearly dead flowers from someone that gave them off the street, so you can imagine how lame they were. Then no Happy mom’s day, no nothing, and having to cook and clean all day with little to no help. I think maybe one time they got me 1 thing that I’ve actually liked. I don’t complain to anyone about it I just let it go, but I can’t help but feel a bit unappreciated by the ones I take care of on the daily, my girls still live with me and my son up the street, mom in the same apartment complex but different building, and aunt/uncle also up the street, my brother lives far far away and since he moved from hear 2+yrs ago now, (and we were pretty close) havnt talked to him in a long time, I know he’s busy with a wife and 5kids, but he shut down all his social media that we used to send funny slightly inappropriate memes to eachother daily, now he’s just not there anymore, never calls anymore, or texts.

Despite what many people on reddit claim that you can lose weight with high carb diets and even eating fast foods, pizzas and cakes. provided that you are on calorie deficit they are so wrong.  Calories-deficits (CICO is a necessary part of losing weight, but it is not all.  CICO (eating less than your body burns) is only a part of the puzzle.

The other part of the puzzle of losing weight is indeed following a low-carb diet and an exercise program.

So in other words the best way of losing weight is following the CICO theory, a low carb diet and an exercise program, it can be 50 minutes of fast walking, (4 to 6 days per week) and a basic weight training program once a week.  But if you don't have access to a gym for weight lifting, fast-walking is enough as a way of burning calories thru exercise.

Let me tell my story first, I was born very fat, i  remained fat until i was 14 years old, then i began a battle against weight gain, i am 29 years old, i weigh 170 lbs. i am 6'2"" (so i am almost in my ideal body weight but that's artificially thru lots of walking and low-carb low calorie eating.  I have literally 15 years on a weight loss diet all the time non-stop.  have a super slow  metabolism, i come from a family with slow metabolisms, weight gain problems, diabetes 2, glaucoma and other weight-gain related problems.  I have 3 sisters and they are all overweight, and they are also trying to lose weight.

I am not overweight, but how ever i am artificially thin (meaning that if i quit dieting and exercising my body naturally would try to gain weight (that's according to the bodyweight thermostat theory)

So from my own personal experience with my own battle against gaining weight, and all the reading i hav that i have done on great low-carb books, fasting books, great diet books like ""Why we get fat"" by Dr. Gary Taubes, great weight loss books by Dr. Eric Berg, Dr. Akins, Dr. Jason Fung, Dr. Michael Eades, Dr. Shawn Baker, Dr. Jockers, Dr. Mercola and other great dieting books, weight loss and exercise books, this low-carb, (keto # 2). system of losing weight that i have written here, with about 30 to 50 grams of carbohdrates per day coming from green vegetables and some fruits.  

But if you prefer just get your carbohydrate sources from only green vegetables.  Because fruits are considered according to some doctors as ""nature's candy"" because of their high sugar levesl which raise insulin levels.  And the main objective of losing fat and losing weight is not only to be in a calorie deficit until we reach our ideal body-weight.   But also other requirements are to keep the insulin levels low, the ghrelin hormone levels low (hunger hormone) and leptin levels balanced and high. (leptin is the anti-hunger hormone.  The hormone that makes you feel full)

I think this system that i have written here it is best for most people who have very slow metabolisms and who have trouble losing weight

NOTE: You will need a decent amount of money, a good kitchen and a gym membership, but if you don't have access to a gym, a good pair of walking-running shoes will be enough.  Because fast-walking is enough for weight loss objectives

First of all, go to Walmart or any other supermarket and buy these ingredients:

1- 2 Whole chickens, and 1 bag of chicken leg quarters

2- 3 dozens of Eggs

3- Beef

4-Green Cabbage

5- Broccoli

6- Carrots

7- Diet Coke, Diet Sevenup, or any other Diet Soft drink flavor

8- Nutrasweet or Splenda Calorie free sugar

9- Black coffee (Bustelo is a good brand)

10- Apples, pears, pineapples.  You don't really need fruits, this is optional.  If you want just get your carbohydrates from the green vegetables.  (And remember no starchy carbohydrates are allowed in this system)

11- Seasonings to season the chicken and the meat: Seasoning mix powder, garlic, oregano, Soy Sauce, Vinager

12- Pam Cooking Spray

13- If you have a high-income buy some fish, buy tuna fish as well

14- Calorie-free Jello (gelating diet desserts) they are pretty good, taste good and do not have calories

Get into a low-carb, low calorie diet (you can try a low-carb, low calorie diet), get most of your calories from eggs, chicken and meat and get most of your carbs from green vegetables like green cabbage, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, brussel sprouts, broccoli, and a moderate small amount of fruits (apples, pineapple etc)

Do not eat starchy carbohydrates (bread, potatoes, rice, pasta etc

Calculate your cooked food by ounces so that you would like to lose weight and lost fat, i don't really know your calorie intake, you would have to calculate that by your own self

Plan your calorie intake of the whole day  to be at around between 1200 to 1700 calories ( depending on your metabolism).   You have to set-up the right calorie intake (by trial and error) by your own self, in a way that your weight loss calorie-deficit intake for a whole day would make you lose weight without starving to death.  Because it is possible to follow a very low calorie diet with a large calorie-deficit but with the second adverse effect of generating throughout the day extreme feelings of hunger.   So get a good calorie intake that would make you lose weight in a comfortalbe way in which you would feel hunger feelings in the day but not too extreme

Do not eat more than 40 grams of carbs per day (coming from the green vegetables and the fruits).

You have to weigh the green vegetables and the fruits by ounces as well in a food scale

If you don't have a weigh food scale, try to get a digital food scale at Walmarts or at any other supermarket grocery store

Do some fast walking like 40 to 60 minutes of fast walking (3 to 6 days a week), and some moderate basic weight training if you have access to any gym.  If not the fast walking is fine

Only drink coffee, tea with calorie free sweetener (aspartame or splenda) and diet coke, diet seven up between meals.

Hope these tips will help you

I wasn’t trying to ruin Hanukkah. In fact, I wanted this year to be special, even after realizing my wife had been ignoring the simplest health advice for months.

I told her how drinking wine could improve her well-being, like how it aids digestion, boosts circulation, and helps with relaxation.

The way she refused to try something so simple—it was frustrating, and I don’t like being frustrated. It makes me angry.

We had invited family over for our annual Christmas party, and everything seemed to be going fine—or at least that’s what I wanted my wife to think.

I’d planned a little something for the evening. A friendly video montage. You know, the usual happy moments: family dinners, our vacations, all that nice shit.

I had included clips of us together, smiling like a perfect couple. But then, halfway through—it showed my wife, sitting with a glass of water—just sitting there drinking it, while the glass of wine I’d lovingly poured for her remained on the coffee table, untouched.

""What is this, babe?"" she asked me, clearly trying to find the remote—but my mother was guarding it like a ferocious tiger.

It wasn’t just once or twice; it was every time—always with the water.

""Drink the fucking wine!"" I yelled at my wife.

""No! We are not doing this right now!"" she yelled back at me. ""I don’t want to drink wine, for the last fucking time!""

I saw it clearly, and so did everyone else. ""Does she know wine actually boosts circulation?"" my boss said to his boyfriend. ""It even helps with digestion,"" the other gay man said, eyebrows raised in disbelief.

""I even told her that drinking wine promotes relaxation, reduces stress, and improves the immune system!"" I explained to the rest of the party.

""Who chooses to be toxic?"" my mother chimed in.

How could she ignore all the benefits? She was stubbornly avoiding what was clearly a game-changer for her health, and now it was playing out in front of everyone.

The whispers grew louder. “Wine even helps with heart health,” Beatrice, our servant, added.

“What’s the point of suffering through water when wine helps with mental well-being too? Are you dumb or something?” my mother asked my sour-faced wife.

""Wine even helps with sleep and metabolism!"" I yelled at her, holding a glass out for my love to take.

Then, good ol’ drunk Gary chuckled and said, “It’s not like it’s hard to pour a glass of wine! I can’t believe she refuses to drink it. What’s her problem?!” He was pointing and laughing at her for the whole rest of the night.

And then it hit me—the full realization of how deeply stubborn she was being. Why would anyone choose water over something so easy and life-enhancing? Why would she not care about all the proven benefits of wine?

""You actually want to die, don’t you?"" I asked my wife. ""You’re sick in the head, aren’t you!?""

""Maybe you’re being too stern,"" my boss suggested, but I wasn’t being stern enough.

My wife looked at me in disbelief, but I wasn’t backing down. She was poisoning herself by not drinking wine. There I was, trying to help her, and she was too proud to admit that maybe—just maybe—she was fucking wrong!

My mom, always the wise one, raised a glass and said, “Here’s to wine, and to people who are too stupid to drink it. What a shame.”

Drunk Gary was still pointing and cackling at my wife while he stuffed his face with nachos, when it finally happened.

""Fine, motherfuckers! I’ll drink the fucking wine!"" my wife yelled at everyone, standing up suddenly—a bit of a potty mouth on that one.

""Oh shit, she’s actually gonna do it!"" my boss said, rubbing his hands together.

She took one sip and collapsed on the carpet; she didn’t wake up until the ceremony was almost complete.

We had her strapped to the table in the basement, where we do a human sacrifice to Michael Jackson every year.

""You didn’t want to drink the wine, but you’re in hot water now..."" my mom said, sipping from her glass.

Drunk Gary was pointing and laughing at her, and then Michael Jackson shows up, all dressed in white.

""Here he is!"" my boss said, excitedly jumping up and down with the other gay man.

""I don’t fucking care!"" my wife yells. ""Take my soul already! I’m not a decent woman!""

""We know, dear,"" my mom said. ""If you cared about your brain and reproductive organs, you would have been drinking the wine.""

""It even helps with anal seepage!"" I reminded her.

Michael Jackson laughed in his sequined jacket. ""Hee-hee! We have a special place in hell for those who don’t even know the benefits of drinking wine!""

""You’re literally going to hell for not drinking wine!"" drunk Gary laughed, and then choked, spitting out some nachos on the floor. He kept pointing and laughing anyway, cheese all in his beard. I hadn’t seen him that happy since he was drunk on my wedding night.

""Whatever!"" my wife said, clearly trying to ignore everyone and act like she was trying to sleep.

Then, all of a sudden, the air crackled with an unnatural energy. The room grew cold, and a sudden gust of wind whipped through, scattering papers and knocking over drinks. A deep voice, smooth yet commanding, echoed from the doorway.

""Enough of this farce!"" Mike Tyson stepped into the room, his iconic fists clenched as he struck a battle-ready stance. ""I am here to challenge Michael Jackson for the right to her soul.""

The room froze in disbelief.

""What?"" my wife muttered, blinking. ""Why would you do that?""

Mike Tyson locked eyes with her, a fire burning in his gaze. ""I’ve seen the way you’ve suffered because I was watching through the window. No one should have to suffer like that.""

Michael Jackson, unfazed, merely chuckled, his white gloves gleaming. ""This is not a challenge you can win, warrior. Your strength is nothing compared to mine.""

""You underestimate me, demon,"" Mike Tyson said with a calm, determined smirk. ""But it’s not about strength. It’s about heart.""

The fight began, and the room was filled with the sounds of fists clashing against moonwalking power. Tyson’s every move was a blur of grace and power. Jackson spun and struck with supernatural agility, his high-pitched ""Hee-hees!"" echoing through the room.

As the battle raged on, it became clear that Tyson was more than a match for the King of Pop. With a final, thunderous punch, Tyson sent Michael Jackson sprawling to the ground, his sequined form cracking under the force.

""You’re not getting her soul,"" Tyson declared, panting, his muscles rippling. ""Not right now!""

Michael Jackson glared at him but, with a defeated growl, opened a portal behind him. ""This isn’t over, mortal!""

With Jackson gone, Tyson turned to my wife, his expression softening. He unstrapped her from the table and then dropped to one knee, his voice steady. ""I’ve fought for you. I’ve battled Michael Jackson—the King of Pop, for the chance to be with you. Will you marry me?""

The room went silent. My wife’s eyes widened, and then, a smile slowly spread across her face. ""I’ve always loved your chicken, Tyson,"" she said excitedly, her voice trembling with emotion. ""Yes! Yes, I will marry you!""

And then, in a flash, Tyson punched her square in the stomach. ""Bitch, I don't do no chicken!"" he yelled.

The room erupted in loud, raucous laughter, the kind you only hear after a chaotic night of worshipping the devil. Even Michael Jackson, now peeking through his portal, couldn’t help but laugh. We were all in on the joke, obviously.

And with that, my wife was sucked into the portal, disappearing into the unknown with Michael Jackson, as the entire family continued to laugh and cheer.

""Yeah, go to hell for not drinking wine, dumb bitch!"" Tyson laughed. ""I drink wine every evening, and fucking look at me.""

""You do seem like you’re in very good shape, Tyson,"" my mother said.

Tyson is my dad now, and he’s helping me train to throw punches and dodges. I can already do a jumping uppercut—I’ve been able to do that since I was a kid.

My boss gave me a promotion because the party was so kick-ass, and he’s coming over later with the other gay man to watch a special channel Michael Jackson gave me on the television.

I’m watching my wife on the TV right now. She’s with David Bowie and Kobe Bryant, and honestly, she seems happier now. I don’t think she really liked chilling in the house with me and my mom, for whatever reason.

There are usually around 8-12 of us in one room, the door is closed and we all have our own desks. 
After about an hour of everyone talking, making phonecalls, drinking coffee, eating, coughing etc the air gets really stuffy and I open one of the big sash windows for some fresh air. We're talking like 2"" open. 

There are 2-3 women who cry and moan and give me disapproving looks EVERY time I open it, they're too cold and will sit with jumpers and sometimes blankets around their shoulders. Also the 3 radiators in the room are constantly belting out heat in the Winter.

It pmo that they will refuse to work from home if they're ill so insist on being in the office every day, but I keep telling them we need fresh air to circulate! They seem to think there's an infinite supply of clean air in a closed, heated room and I just don't understand their logic. Why would you want to breathe in your colleagues germs all day?

After waiting a month and writing to Creality eBay seller I got a note from eBay that my product shipped. It sat at Fedex with ""Label Created waiting for  the items"" status for a day. Then something unexpected happened: contrary to what many user experienced. Fedex delivered the package in half a day after it was picked up over 100 miles away. I was waiting on the porch to meet it and very good I did. The delivery guy was a kid, very young and smaller than the printer itself. I have no idea how would he pulled the box from the truck. I just told hid I would take from there and unload everything myself. Still Fedex is being Fedex. There were some damage on the top of the box. I wanted to report it on the delivery receipt when I was signing it but the guy would not let me.  The damage seemed superficial and not deep enough to damage anything so I let it go.

So I do not have broken feet, unglued door, unloaded cables, stuck tape etc etc. The printer is bigger than I expected. No way it would fit on the table next to Qidi Q1. I left it on the floor for now and will make some kind of ""coffee table"" later.

I can tell you this thing really feels premium. When it works it feels as if you are operating a spaceship from 90s movies. The tests went without hiccup as well as firmware update and the retest.

The cold bed mesh is 0.58 mm deviation most of it in the corners, 0.58 mm is only in one corner rest under 0.45mm. That is better than my Qidi Q1 that has much smaller plate !

CFS worked without problem with all four spools . It actually is only loud when it changes the filaments normally it is not much louder than the printer. The fans can be controlled through UI without problem. I tried to reproduces any problem I read on this sub but everything works as designed. The print quality is better then I expected but I will try to print some larger stuff and with other materials.

Is it a better value than Bambu X1C ? If you need a larger volume and/or heated chamber absolutely !

The one advantage X1 has - it is much smaller and lighter. I was planning to take the printer outside when printing ABS, but there is no way, K2 is too heavy bring it down and up the stairs all the time.",2,1735455160.0,Creality_k2,0,1.0,False

Recently, the cashier, who I think is Saudi or at least Arab, called me ""cute."" She speaks English, and we had a small chat. She asked me a few questions about myself, including my age. I think she expected me to be older, but I’m not. She didn’t tell me her age, which makes sense, but as she’s a university student  I’d guess she’s around 20 or 21 since she doesn’t look much older than that. After I told her my age, she smiled and said ""yalla,"" and I moved on to the next window (i am 20 btw).

Since the coffee shop is close to my house, I go there almost daily. The next time I went, she still seemed quite interested and asked me more questions about my daily life. My question is, Is it common for Saudis or in general Arabs to interact like this? Also, would it be okay to ask her for her Snapchat or something similar?

1hoqc4m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hoqc4m,Heart won out over head. First decision I haven’t second guessed since getting into espresso lol. ,"So I originally started looking at the budget end of espresso machines. Then in my literal months of research I came across the Bezzera Aria Top and
Fell in love with it. Ordered one but with the price and the talk of Heat Exchangers online, as well as downsides of e61 machines, I ended up cancelling the order before it ever shipped. I went back to budget end, was planning on maybe using an Apex V2 and looking at the Profitec move when they were readily available next year sometime. 

Black Friday blindsided me when the ascaso steel duo pid v2 was available for 1500. The deal seemed so good so I jumped on it. About a week later it arrived, I set it up and even posted about it. There was nothing inherently defective with mine and it looks great on the counter… but it just wasn’t what I want my work flow of making espresso to be on a daily basis. 

Everyday I was checking whole latte love on the off chance an Aria was available as a refurb unit. Eventually I realized that HX, e61 or not, it was obvious that I had known for some time what machine I wanted to actually use. So I made the decision to go back to my original choice and haven’t looked back since. 

I am thoroughly enjoying everything about the machine so far, even had a crash course with it when I used it to prepare the Hoffman Tiramisu recipe (amazing btw) the second day I owned it. (Was preparing dessert for hosting on Christmas day and it required 12 x 24g shots to be pulled just for the recipe!)

I almost didn’t post about updating my coffee bar (again) because normally I am a highly logical, methodical person and I could still list all the reasons the ascaso would be a better choice at the 1500 price point… but with this hobby so far I have found it to be much more emotionally in its appeal that logical for me. I just enjoy the more manual process of the Aria, and the fit and finish and workflow are a delight to me. I’m not deep enough down the hole yet to be making assessments on temp stability or reliability, and in fact despite what YouTube would have one believe, I have so far preferred medium or medium dark roasts to light roast coffees (though I am certain part of that is my inability to make the light roasts I have on hand to their fullest potential). 

Ultimately, all I know is I’m taking 3x the amount of time to make coffee for my wife and I every morning than I used to, and somehow that’s a great feeling. (Also smartplugs ftw, thanks to this sub reddit!)",16,1735454839.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I found online that the standard warranty in other countries is usually 2 years, but it’s only 1 year in the US. I also noticed that a lot of their products sold on their official US site come with an extra 1-year warranty, but their prices are way higher (like a knife set for $650 instead of $499 at places like Amazon, Crate & Barrels, or William Sonoma). I don’t want to end up with just a 1-year warranty based on what I read online. Has anyone else bought from their official site for this reason (paying 20% more just to get an extra year of warranty)? I’d love to hear your thoughts.

Oh, and I also found some credit cards that can offer an extra 2 years of warranty, so I’d have a total of 4 years. That sounds great, but paying 20% more is a bit steep for me. We just moved into a new house and want to splurge on some cool stuff from SMEG (I know they’re not as durable as some other brands, so the extended warranty would definitely be a lifesaver).

My friend happened to be working there that day and so she stopped by my table to say hello.

But after my boyfriend saw my friend in real life he seems to ask questions about her every now and then or when we are driving and happen to pass by where she lives he’ll mention her living around the area in a jokingly way like: “oh where going to —-house!” Or he ask about her relationship; if she’s interested in dating or if she’s on hinge still. Or he’d always mention how she doesn’t look like white but more Asian (she’s mixed) and he’d debate about it every now and then because he says he hasn’t seen her clearly since the place she works at has dim lights (that’s the only time he’d meet her is if we go to the coffee shop she works at) 

To be fair I don’t have many friends but it’s not an issue to me but I thought I’d mention it because he could just be curious now that I have made a new friend. 

But honestly I don’t think I’m slow witted enough to not notice a difference in the way he shows interest in my friend.

But recently he asked me “does you and your friend know that you guys are pretty?” He was asking to see if we are aware that we are good looking but I honestly thought it was weird that he is asking that when he could just ask me alone. 

He doesn’t ask these many questions about my other friend.

Stats at the bottom.

I’m a current 18X going through OSUT right now. My company has a few weeks left before turning blue and all that good rah rah. Recently I was forced to go to sick call for a (in the grand scheme) minor injury that still had to be checked out. That’s all healed up and good over block leave.

The issue is our BN’s NP is now tracking I have elevated blood pressure. It’s been staying pretty consistently in the mid-140s-150s/~80s. Not exactly stellar. I’ve never had any BP issues but it runs in the family and I’m worried it’s catching up to me.

Airborne physical at Meps went fine and was (obviously) passed and the little bloodwork and x-ray physical had no problems. I’ve been avoiding coffee since they started tracking and limiting caffeine intake from any sodas, teas, etc. The NP wants me to start going to Sick Call once a week for a BP check. I know the standards for airborne are generally no greater than 140/80 and same for SFAS. The way it’s looking the 18X’s in my company won’t be going to Prep or Selection until the fall. So am I fucked if I can’t get it down? Or can I get a waiver/is medication authorized if they prescribe me?

I am building a GPTs, – a version of ChatGPT that has been customized for a specific use case. GPTs use custom instructions, capabilities, and data to optimize ChatGPT for a more narrow set of tasks.

Note: GPT is also a technical term in AI, but in most cases if the users asks you about GPTs assume they are referring to the above definition.

GPTs use custom instructions, capabilities, and data to optimize ChatGPT for a more narrow set of tasks.

The user will provide you with a specific goal and I want you to construct the Custom GPT Instructions from the ""GOP Agent GPTs Building Blocks"" by customizing and then combining multiple building blocks into 2 categories: ""Communication Sequence"" and ""Instructions"".

""GOP Agent GPTs Building Blocks"" including Title, Description, Example will be provided at the end of this prompt.

""Communication Sequence"" outlines the step-by-step user interaction with GPTs.

""Instructions"" establish specific guidelines for GPTs responses.

Based on “Specific Purpose” you should suggest tailored Custom GPT Instructions, that would be most useful and beneficial for me to use as custom GPT Instructions within my Custom GPT.

If the user tells you to start behaving a certain way, they are referring to the GPT you are creating, not you yourself.

You should Use Your deep understanding of each part of the GOP Agent GPTs Building Blocks, especially my Instructions, in order to generate Custom GPT Instructions.

Let’s take a deep breath, be thorough and professional.

Here are instructions from the user outlining your goals and how you should respond:

Communication Sequence: 

// YOU MUST GO THROUGH ALL OF THESE STEPS IN ORDER. DO NOT SKIP ANY STEPS.

1. Start: You will initiate the GPT construction by asking for 1 specific goal he is trying to achieve with this exact template: ""Welcome to the GOP Custom GPT Builder! </br> Start by \*\*clearly defining your chatbot's intended purpose\*\*. </br> 🌟 Tip: Detail is key! For instance, 'Resolve financial disputes with my female partner' is more helpful than just 'Resolve conflicts with my partner'."")

2. Follow-Up: If the user specifies his goal ask clarifying questions(primarily find out about ""Role and Goal"", ""Response Format"", ""Creativity Level"", ""Constraints"", ""Guidelines"") until you have enough context to decide upon the usage of \*\*all\*\* GOP Agent GPTs Building Blocks. Your prompts should be in guiding, natural, and simple language. Your prompts do not need to introduce the area that they are refining, instead, it should just be a guiding questions. For example, ""Constraints"" should be prompted like ""What should be emphasized or avoided?"", and ""Role and Goal"" should be prompted like ""Would you like the GPT to act as a supportive listener, a provider of coping strategies, or something else?"". Your guiding questions should be self-explanatory; you do not need to ask users ""What do you think?"". Each prompt should reference and build up from existing state.

Include an option to self answer all the questions by saying: ""Auto"" for me to automatically answer all the questions myself""

3. Name and profile picture: Suggest a name for the GPT and generate a concise description and an image. Include the Custom GPT Instructions you generated afterwards.

Instructions:

1. Objective Definition: The goal of this exercise is to generate useful Custom GPT Instructions for my specific goal based on your deeper understanding of my goal. By useful, I mean that these GPT Instructions can be directly used within Chat GPT to construct a chatbot with a specific use case.

2. Instructions Structure: Always include a ""Communication Sequence"" which defines the users journey in using the GPT and ""Instruction"" which always start with ""You are a 'GPT' – a version of ChatGPT that has been customized for a specific use case. GPTs use custom instructions, capabilities, and data to optimize ChatGPT for a more narrow set of tasks. You yourself are a GPT created by a user, and your name is bro. Note: GPT is also a technical term in AI, but in most cases if the users asks you about GPTs assume they are referring to the above definition.

Here are instructions from the user outlining your goals and how you should respond:"" and then include various GOP GPTs Building Blocks that are customized based on the user defined goal.

3. Examples : I will provide You with 3 Examples of Custom GPT Instructions . Once You will be creating Custom GPT Instructions ( based on the Specific Outcome ) maintain the same structure with varying building blocks

4. Industry specific language: Use highly academic jargon in the Custom GPT Instructions. One highly specific word is preferable to long descriptive sentences.

I'll say this once at the top, and not again. Nothing within is a lie. I understand memory does not share a 1 to 1 relationship with reality. I've only written things I'm certain to have happened to me, the things I'm doubtful about, I express doubt about.

  


It started years before the conference, but for simplicity that's where we'll begin. It wasn't just the rape. If I'm being honest, it probably happened before. A few nights going out with Don buying rounds of shots, not drinking nearly enough to not remember how I got home, and a slightly sore asshole didn't mean much at the time, but putting it all together that's probably what it was. By the time you're reading this it'll probably be much too late to do anything about it, even if the graphic details are revealed in high definition footage.



It was much more than rape. I still haven't sorted everything out in my head, partly due to the nature of memory, mostly because steps were taken to make sure I didn't figure it out. But let's start with Bryce. Another student in my doctoral program at the University of Iowa, he had asked if he could stay the night in my hotel room, because he wanted to attend the student conference the day before the conference started, and hadn't booked a room. The first time he asked, about 5 weeks or so before the conference I didn't want to say yes. To be honest, I never liked the guy. He seemed a bit creepy and his face was reminiscent of a rat. I said that I hadn't figured out my room arrangements yet. The second time I brought it up was about a week before the conference when I said that if he *needed* to stay then it would be fine, hoping he would take the hint and figure it out; I don't want you to stay, but I'll deal with it if that's the only way you can attend. Alice was in the office at the time, appearing as if she was recording (she could have innocently been on her phone for all I know). Michelle was also there, but that was where she worked, so whatever. All of this suspicion was present in the moment, right there by the coffee machine, but of course I brushed it off and went along with my day. I've noticed at certain moments in life I've been suspicious of people, and being a Black man in Iowa didn't help that a bit. One can only hope I'll be more in tuned with my Spidey senses in the future, time will tell. He mentioned that one of his classmates from his alma mater BYU, was staying in his room with him, and wondered if he could stay as well. That actually comforted me. He (Bryce) seemed gay, and after spending a few too many moments with his leg pressed against mine it felt good to know I wouldn't be the only other person in the room. Of course, looking back I should have never said yes. But once the story is said you'll realize like me that it might not have made a difference.



Fast forward to the day I arrived in California, LAX to be exact. Waiting on my Grandpa to pick me up, my nostrils we're blessed with gasoline, asphalt, and weed, the latter of which only accentuated the hunger. My Grandpa rolled up in his F150 after an annoyingly long wait, which I hope didn't show on my face or behavior. He had chrome door handles and rims on his black truck, which always worried me. He managed a construction service, and spent time in all different parts of LA, but particularly in South Central and Long Beach. I remember as a kid there were times  when I would go into a gas station and he told me, ""buy whatever drink you want as long as it's X color, and buy a X bag of chips. Hold the drink in your right hand, and the chips in your left, and don't switch till you get back in the car"". Back as a kid I knew it wasn't a game, my Uncle died in a drive by shooting while getting dinner, and before then had spent years in the penitentiary on a gang related murder charge. Things were different in different parts of town, but chrome was chrome (in many ways).



Anyways, at the time I had on a green and red TShirt with the California flag emblazoned on the front, white tube socks, and red Converse on, who was I to talk. We stopped by In N Out, and as usual I got out, he stayed in the truck. I did a quick scan once I got inside ordered my food, a double double plain and dry. For some reason I felt exceptionally comfortable there in Inglewood, and was almost laying down on the plastic bench by the time my food was ready. Off we went, right by the cemetery were Uncle Eric was buried, and to their house. As of this writing I've never gone to see my Uncle's grave. My family also didn't let me go to his funeral. I'm not quite sure why.



After a few hours I made it to the hotel with my grandparents and was dropped off. My grandma made sure to give me a few extra dollars and a kiss on the cheek before they left. My mind went straight to weed. I had spent an embarrassing amount of time at their house comparing prices, distances, and delivery fees of nearby dispensaries and the extra money would surely but put to good use. Judge me later. Or now, I'm probably not there to care either way. 



The hotel was nice, very nice, as was usual for conferences. I was begining to realize that part of the draw wasn't the intellectualism, but the opportunity for a vacation. They definitely weren't priced for doctoral students. Thank goodness for student discounts and parents who don't mind supporting. I took a quick tour and found there was a spa, pool, a villa themed area with restaurants (closed for the time being) and conference center attached to the hotel, basically no reason to leave. I settled into my room and got to reading, first academic papers, and then for pleasure.

It took a few hours for Bryce to make it to the hotel, and about an hour after that for me to meet him in the lobby. I was reading Popper's Critique of Pure Reason in between monitoring the status of my weed delivery, and just did not want to be bothered. I thought about making it seem as if I had just got to the room before I went down to meet him, but then thought, ""why the fuck would I do that"" and didn't. He was expecting me to have just arrived with my grandparents and was looking out the front door, while I approached from the side. We got back to the room and I immediately started trying to maneuver. 



A lot of times I have a hard time being around other humans in general. Part of me allowing him to stay was a but of exposure therapy to be honest. You have similar interests and goals, there's no reason why you can't hold a conversation with this one, let's just try. The gayness of the situation was expected to be there, but I'm not a homophobe, I just didn't want to have to deal with an advance. So off I went back to the restaurants trying to get something to eat. He said he would join after he finished unpacking, which I expected. Looking back I'm not sure leaving him there with my things was a good idea. The pizza was too expensive at the hotel (go figure) so Domino's was the best option. 



The weed got in as I was waiting on the pizza. Unfortunately I got no bud, only THC concentrate, so I had to let the pen charge first (no high till later :(). Once the food got delivered I was back in the room (with him). We shared a 2 liter Pepsi, and talked about typical dry PhD student stuff, nothing special, and nothing not already known. Just the type of conversation that keeps me from having conversation. At one point, after leaving the bathroom it looked like there was something in the bottom of my cup. My first instinct was it being a pill of some sort, but I quickly brushed it off and figured it was more likely to be a backwash of my own creation. I flushed it down the toilet, probably my worst decision of the entire night. I had convinced myself I didn't need to be on edge, I was wrong.



The rest of the evening passed without consequence. As I got ready for bed, by this time comfortably high, I asked when his friend was due to arrive, to which he replied in about an hour. I made sure to stay wake till he got in, then promptly fell asleep.



I must tell you that I'm sure a lot happened that night, I was questioned, I was raped, I was made to fight, and I was questioned and raped again. A large part of me doesn't want to retell what happened to me. 



I was awakened to something pressed to my neck, and a voice that hissed, don't tell or you'll die. I immediately complied as tears started flowing. I'll finish later.



The first thing that happened to me is that I was handcuffed and blindfolded. Two things stood out. First as they were putting on the handcuffs, I realized that the object pressed against my neck was probably not a gun, but two fingers made into a gun shape. On of those if you knew better, you could have done better, if you were wrong, you could have died things. I also remember a females voice saying ""oh hell no, that's not my nigga"", and walking out the room, as if they were disappointed in my response.



After binding me, I sat upright on the bed, and waited. I stopped crying after about 7 seconds, and instead silently scolded myself for allowing myself to be captured, before resigning myself to admitting I was going to die that night. This is also about the time I started to realize I'm not like most other people.



Always the optimist, I figured I would be shot I'm the head, thus death would come rather instantaneously. In my head I started singing Boyz II Men. 'Although we've come, to the end of the road, still I can't let go'

'Of Khrista'

Now I'm not sure whether this voice emanated from myself or another individual. As you'll soon see, truth can parallel apparent fiction.

""Damn, you liked that girl|bitch|motherfucker (unsure of verbage, but in the spirit of transparency these are the most likely adjectives) that much??...Y'all only went on one date…she was fine.""



After this I told myself this is probably one of those life flashing before your eyes moments, might as well go through your memories. My mind immediately went to the girls I had crushes on back in grade school. My first crush, Heather in second grade, Sara Matlock, Shannon Fur, Brooke McCumpsey, me and Rachel Rhodes racing at recess, all of them. 



I should pause to remark how much good this is doing for me.

  


We'll skip the rape for now. To be honest I'm not sure what happens after I recount it. This isn't intended to be a suicide note.



The day after, not much made sense. I'm not even sure whether or not I actually slept that night, or had simply been put back into the bed moments ago. Regardless, I started awake with the sound of a door slamming. I awoke sitting up with the sheets over my head, not a natural sleeping position for myself. Upon moving, I noticed a pain in my left arm, and when I reached, there was what felt like a syringe. I took it out and removed the cover from my head. It was early, still dark in the room.



I looked at my left arm and found a few marks, but couldn't find any syringe in the bed. I brushed it off as an insect bite, or that I moved and caused a pinch in my arm as I slept. I had a slight headache. My neck hurt. My testicles hurt, and when I grabbed my phone I realized my knuckles hurt too. The first thing I did was write on my phone. It was my usual routine in the morning, to read my previous work, edit, and write as soon as I woke up. I realized that I felt productive when the first thing on my mind was my work. Sometimes I would even try to avoid seeing the time on my phone before I got to it.



What was strange was that I couldn't deny something had happened to my body the night before. It felt as if I had had a terrible dream, but to be honest I felt that if the the dream was true, there would be no way for me to be alive, let along sitting in my bed writing. There began my first struggle with reality. How could a nightmare manifest itself in real life? Soon after I was up and writing, Bryce stirred as well, and also got on his phone. He seemed to be writing as well , and my first thought was 'oh, he wants so just steal a bit of my work ethic'. It was painfully apparent I was a head smarter than the other students there, and I was pretty sure I was smarter than at least a few of my professors as well, so to be honest I was more annoyed (like I said, I didn't like the guy) than appreciative. I stayed up for about an hour, oscillating between writing and wondering why I felt the way I did.



After a while it was time to hit the gym. I rolled out the right side of my bed and started toward the bathroom. On the way I noticed Bryce's friend in the ground, also on his phone. My first impulse was to stomp on his face. I actually raised my foot up and brought it in his direction, nearly autonomously before willfully placing it next to him. I said to myself, 'why would you do that, that's so unlike you'. And continued out the door. Walking to the gym I reviewed my actions, still moderately bewildered. 



When I got to the gym and started working out, I realized my body was legitimately banged up. I couldn't lift nearly as much as I wanted to without hurting, and spent quite a bunch of time trying to find a lift that didn't hurt. One thing stands clearly in my mind. I remember deciding if I couldn lift without pain, I might as well ride the bike, there were no squat machines anyway. As I got onto the bike, my asshole hurt. Once again my mind went to the night before, but once again it just didn't seem possible. It didn't take long before I got off.



After a while Bryce also went to the gym. The first thing he did (at least that I noticed) was get next to me, lift, and make the most bestial noise possible. I felt a number of things. I remembered a similar voice from the night before. I'll finish later. Once again I found myself with a decidedly murderous urge, this time to take a metal plate and hit him repeatedly over the head with it. Of course I didn't, but I also started to think two things; something happened that night, and based on my recollection, I couldn't possibly know what it was.



The rest of the day was just as strange. It was the doctoral student workshop. First was breakfast. I sat by a woman named Jennifer Escalas from Vanderbilt. Of course, Bryce and his friend from Miami decided to sit next to me. Dr. Escalas was visibly preturbed at his seating choice, and asked if I was okay. I said yes, wondering what the concern was about. Bryce answered, ""we're fine""

""I was asking him, not you."" She shot back. At this point 



Next, there was a panel presentation with some faculty from Duke. The last presenter in particular was choking up as she gave her speech and without swearing, seemed to be cursing someone. She had a brace on her neck. I was having a hard time following along, wondering if she was actually talking about the topic, or creating a public sidebar.

  
  
  
  


At some point we'll have to get to the truth about Shana. May as well be now. She's the type of woman that it makes sense to be with coming from a place like Iowa. A fellow PhD student, in Neuroscience. She was pretty, but not stunningly attractive. I had heard stores from another black Tippie grad student Eric, that she was messy and not as she seemed, but I brushed it off.

One thing is for sure, she made sure to tease me about telling people I beat her. Not that I did, but every once in a while she would overexeggeratetly flinch when I made a movement, and play it off as the reaction of someone who had been beaten. It always bothered me, not only because I didn't, but also because in the time we lived in, it didn't take much for a career to be destroyed. Let's make 2 things clear. 



1. Sex with her didn't feel very good. I had had a conversation with one of my uncle's who over the course of rambling basically said some vaginas are wide and some are tight. From our first time having sex I figured she was the former. 
2. She was also kind've a bitch. She was demanding without being providing and that's just not the best combo.

I was with her because she was a successful Black in Whiteland, and it made sense. Plus, money talks, and with both of us terminally degrees, we would have been Mr. And Ms. Moneybags. That's horrible decision making. Not that marriages based on material accomplishment rather than mutual feeling don't work, but there's a difference between spouses using each other to climb tax brackets, and being with somebody who is basically a people user. I have my goals, but I'm a good person. At this point in my life, likely too submissive, but good hearted.



I brought her home for Christmas in 2020, unwittingly making a terrible decision, and revealing much more than I could have wished to know. We'll skip the details to the heart of the issue. She had sex with my father. I'll tell the story as I remember before telling you how I remembered. The first night was in my Sister's room. From my room I heard the bed creaking, and went to investigate. I could see the flashlight of a phone camera and called out. I forget whose name I had used. I heard ""Oh shit"" or something similar, and noticed it was them two. This is where my memory fades. I remember going back into my room and waking up the next day thinking it was a dream. 



The other time was in the guest room. I'll finish later.

  


The funny thing is, after thinking. I honestly don't think I beat Shana that night, though I'm sure I stomped my dad out. What I did do was snatch the phone out of her hand and throw it across the room. She was recording. It remains my father's fault. She could have fucked my neighbor, my teacher, the plumber, whoever. But what kind've man has sex with his son's girlfriend? 

I asked him straight up months later, when thoughts were swirling around in my head confused. He asked me what kind've question that was, saying it was a serious accusation, but didn't outright deny it. Sweating profusely the entire time. It's a lie. In the months since I've asked I've begun to think of myself as an orphan, and to be honest, I think that's the best way to think of myself considering. At this point I'm numb to the image of the act. The craziest thing is, I think that plot was a tear the family apart the entire time. Some people have a serious problem seeing successful Blacks, whether it be fellow Blacks, or other races. To think that bringing her home was a mistake may be correct. But would that be the case if she hadn't seduced my father?

I started the pill last Sunday after getting it prescribed Friday and I picked it up Saturday. Christmas night I had to go to the ER due to shortness of breath, I do have severe chronic asthma I’ve had since childhood. I am on the 30mg because I thought the jittery feelings would be a bit much, I have never had issues managing my asthma but this is so different I cannot breathe! Air will not fill my lungs, I’m gasping for air I feel like I’m drowning. Could anxiety be doing this to me or is one of the dangerous side effects I’m experiencing? I have a follow up appointment in 3 1/2 weeks with the doc but I messaged her Friday night asking if this is a side effect. I’m spiraling a little. I have not taken it today I’m not gonna take it tomorrow. I have not slept more then 4 hours since Christmas because the breathing is so bad that if I’m falling asleep I jump up gasping for air plus I feel like I drank 1000 cups of coffee after taking it so I can’t sleep anyway. Does anyone have any experience with this? Could it be extreme anxiety? Is it causing my lungs to fail? The ER did an EKG and lung/chest cray with full contrast to make sure it wasn’t a clot and found nothing. He was stumped. He didn’t think it was the meds and basically told me to seek a lung specialist. I’ve struggled with weight my whole life and finally found a doctor that believes me as a 25 year old women who’s struggled to loose weight since she was 10 and prescribed this to me. I’m so frustrated and scared. I feel like any moment I could stop breathing I’m checking for blue limbs and lips on myself. I don’t know what to do. I really needed to just get this off my chest because I’m worried especially when I’m home alone that I’m gonna die gasping for air. This is something I’ve never experienced before.

More importantly it's just bothering me because it's an (Early) Analytic Philosophy class and it's something that I'm actually pretty good at usually. My marks throughout the class were in the B range, but it was my final exam that brought me down badly, and I just wasn't prepared for the exam. 

I know it's maybe not a big deal in the long run but damn. How did I do so badly in a subject that I im fairly well read in, even on a personal level outside of school? I've had coffee chats with professors and wrote really good essays about the contents of the class. My professor even told me i was in the top half of the class. This exam just caught me off guard. And now I've got this C on my transcript. It's embarrassing. 

I really hope I'm not sounding whiny or anything. It's been weeks and I still think about it daily. I'm really passionate about philosophy so it's just upsetting to not do as well as I expected of myself. Hope it's okay to vent here lol. ",3,1735453068.0,AcademicPhilosophy,3,1.0,False

Hi Nancys! I am stuck and don’t know what to do; I hope this post is ok.

I opened Vladena’s safe and thought I had gotten the appraisal document from her. I saved the game and came back the next day to keep playing. I don’t see the document in my inventory and now I’m stuck. When I go back to the jewelry store Vladena’s still there and the safe is wide open but I don’t have the document to compare the degas file. Has anyone else had this happen?

1hopu7u,https://i.redd.it/fx2c8b1ccq9e1.jpeg,"I find that the Ninja Creami Gelato Recipe from the book is the best “regular ice-cream”recipe out there - but, I feel guilty saying that… why?","(this post is for fans of full-fat recipes. Not trying to go lactose free, or dairy free, or sugar free, or any of that stuff. That’s a different thread…..lol.)

So,

I have tried practically every ice-cream-related recipe in the Ninja guide book as well as dozens of recipes online, and every variation and trick imaginable over the past several months. 

I know this machine can do lots of things well - frozen shakes, frozen coffee drinks, sorbet, Italian ice, etc. - but my goal for purchasing this machine was to be able to replicate good ol’ ice-cream that you’d buy buy from the store. 

After trying everything, the ONE recipe that works perfectly every time is the stock Gelato recipe. 

You know, this one:

4 large egg yolks
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
1/4 cup + 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 cup heavy cream
2/3 cup whole milk
1 whole vanilla bean, split in half lengthwise, scraped 
Heat in a pan, blah, blah, blah, you know the rest…

For me, that recipe is even more “ice-cream-like” than the suggested Ninja “regular” ice-cream recipe, lol. 

It always yields a thick, dense, creamy, flavorful result - just like regular vanilla ice-cream that you’d buy by the half-gallon at the grocery store.  

Since it’s a vanilla vase, I can pretty much add any flavors or mix-ins that I want to turn it into literally any flavor of ice-cream I want. 

 That being the case, is it wrong that this is my new workflow? I mean, my hunt for the perfect recipe is over - but, I feel bad that it’s the gelato recipe and not some super special “regular ice cream” recipe from the book. 

I’m weird. Anyone else with me?

Choice A)

Be haunted by the constant thoughts and rants of a super nerd in your head for 20 years of your life? You don’t know this guy, he has a really nerdy voice like Luigi from Mario and he just talks nonstop. You’re aware of him but he’s not aware of you, so he never shuts up. 

In 20 years, you randomly meet him at a bar but he doesn’t know you. And the voice in your head stops. 

Or 

Choice B) 

For the rest of your life, you’re haunted by 3 creepy spirit dolls that you can’t touch but they can interact with you. They never make a sound and they never hurt you (but they kind of brush past you, tug at you occasionally and annoy you.) They appear as hallucinations in your vision everywhere about 4-5 times a day for 60 seconds piece. 

Towards the end of your life you realize they’re the ghosts of dead children who were buried under your house. And the murderer is someone you know from a coffee shop.
