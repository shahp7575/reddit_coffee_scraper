1gbv0es,https://i.redd.it/655jtjyrswwd1.jpeg,You can't google how big your boobs will get,"Greetings, and thanks for joining me on today's endless loop of doomscrolling Reddit because you're too damn dysphoric to concentrate on anything else.  I'm Shannon, and I'll be your host.

Transitioning, huh?  Maybe you're still trying to decide whether to start, or maybe you're 2.5 months in and nothing is happening yet.  Maybe you look in the mirror and see the same old face you grew up with and you're just sick and tired of it, or maybe you see the sorts of changes that you're afraid will out you to the world.

Maybe you're sick of reading ""YMMV"" any time someone asks the very reasonable question of what the _heck_ is going to happen to their body.  Maybe you just saw a timeline where some pristine √ºbergoddess (who let's face it, may not even be trans) is showing off her homegrown naturals for the world to see, and you just want to bawl because your'e convinced there's no _way_ you can ever look like that.  Or maybe you just saw someone's pic that proudly announces 3 years on E, and it looks like all that changed was when a marble snuck up under their nipples to hide.

Let this be a sign from your Aunt Shannon‚Äîyou can't google how big your boobs will get.  You can't browse Reddit to find a picture of yourself five years from now.  You can't take an online quiz to find out if you're going to pass, and no amount of AI tweaking on FaceApp is going to make your real face change one tiny bit faster.

I love the trans communities on Reddit, but I've spent my fair share of nights on here scratching the mosquito bite itch of my dysphoria until it's red and bloody.  So if you're stuck in that cycle, it's time try something else.

Part of being trans is wanting the world to treat us differently, and because it doesn't, we often close ourselves into dank little trans caves to block out the pain.  It's understandable, and sometimes that's just the protection we need to get through another day.  But in doing so, we risk forgetting that the purpose of our transition is to reenter the world as our true selves.  So I recommend going out to spend time with the one person who won't misgender you.  Yourself.

Have a cup of your favorite hot beverage on a threadbare couch in some downtown, hole-in-the-wall coffee shop while reading a paperback.  Slap on a pair of boots and find a trail where you can get pleasantly lost in nature.  Put on headphones and blast your favorite tunes or audiobook or, I don't know, maybe a podcast about a murder or something.  Have a date with yourself because you're an effing cool individual that is worth spending time with.

It's not going to fix your dysphoria.  But maybe it will give your mind a chance to be calm for a change, give that dysphoria itch that you've scratched bloody a chance to scab over for a change.  Above all, treat yourself like you're WORTHY OF LOVE by showing yourself some of that love.  Then tell us how it went, because this community will be here to love and support you when you get back.

1gbutwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1gbutwq/i_did_it_im_no_longer_overweight_down_68lbs/,I did it - I'm no longer overweight! Down 68lbs,"Back in February I (53f) discovered Dr. Fung's Obesity Code. I have Psoriatic Arthritis and Hashimoto's (plus menopause). My arthritis was in a constant flare and I was always hurting so much that I felt like I wasn't living - just existing. I started fasting AND I gave up all artificial sugar, greatly reduced sugar intake (I eat fruit) and gave up all processed foods (I still eat minimally processed foods like cheese, roasted nuts). I started at 203lbs which at 5'2"" put my BMI at 37 (Obese) and this morning hit 135 so I just squeaked into the normal range!

I started hardcore. I would do 2 and 3 day fasts a few times a week to break my food addictions. It was hard ngl. I didn't know just how addicted to processed foods and sugar I was until I tried to stop. I always thought I ate super healthy, but it turns out that 'healthy' ingredients that are processed with hidden sugars aren't actually healthy at all.

After I started seeing results, I would do ""no meal Mondays"" to offset eating outside my windows on the weekends, then I switched to OMAD or 20:4. I allow myself to eat outside of my windows for social events, weekends with hubby, but I very much limit carbs and sugars. I think I can stuff myself with salmon every day and lose weight - that's my superfood. Lately I've been having a late morning coffee with cream - this is a blissful luxury that doesn't seem to negatively affect my weight loss. Having such a strict diet is hard, but now I can clearly hear my body's response to certain foods. For example, eggplant causes inflammation, high fructose corn syrup makes me gain weight immediately, too much dairy makes me nauseous, red meat is hard for my gut to digest. I love being able to hear my body so clearly. I'm actually more excited to preach about food than weight loss which I didn't expect.  

I exercise most days, but I've taken breaks here and there because my body has a lot going on that makes being active challenging at times. However, my slow days I'll still clock 6,000 steps so I'm not sedentary. My doctors are amazed at my numbers (except bad cholesterol went up?!). All my inflammation markers have dropped significantly, and my thyroid meds have been adjusted down multiple times. My head is clear, my energy is up, and I feel so much younger and healthier. 

Anyone considering trying this lifestyle should not wait. It will work, I promise. I struggled for so long and nothing worked at all until I found IF and eating clean.

1. editing clipart for logos, concept art, mockups, etc.  

2. draft/edit layouts for pubmats, posters, flyers, brochures, etc. 

3. creative fiction/nonfiction writing which includes researching, writing, ghostwriting, proofreading and editing for (but not limited to) stories/short stories, prose and poetry, essays, blogs and articles. I'm mainly focused on but not limited to dark, horror and fantasy themes. I mainly write as a hobby (most of which I post online) or to supplement/contribute my music and art projects. I plan on having my work published as a book in the near future which I currently am working on. I draw inspiration from mythology, tabletop roleplaying games, video games and franchises that involves a large scope of worldbuilding and lore, as well as an ensemble of characters. I have done commissions for school/college papers, thesis and dissertations for about 2-3 years back in college. I'm going by the standard, minimum rate of P1/word for larger projects, while smaller ones can go as low as a cup of coffee! Writing is a fun and therapeutic activity for me, especially when you're able to bring scenes and characters to life that are only limited by the depths of the imagination. So let's maximize that and let's build something together!

First, to get some numbers out of the way: I'm 39m, 6ft tall, CW 227.6lbs, GW 180lbs. I'm currently very sedentary (work from home office-type job, I go for a daily 15 minute walk outside). The TDEE calculator in the ""welcome"" post puts my maintenance at 2379 calories per day. I'm currently eating at a larger deficit than is recommended - my goal every day is to consume around 1400-1500 calories. I'm using Cronometer to shoot for 2lb/week weight loss. 

I weigh and track everything meticulously in Cronometer. I track condiments, I track coffee creamer, I track sauces, etc. There are only four things I do not track:

1. Lettuce (basically no calories)
2. Sugar free jello (super low in calories, it's my sweet snack)
3. Water intake (I get 96oz/day at a minimum)
4. Pam spray (I have no idea how to track this, or if it's even worth doing so?)

All that out of the way - I started tracking and focusing on weight loss on Oct 14th. On 10/17 and 10/18 I went over and hit around 1800 calories, every other day has been under 1500. I've been stuck at my current weight since starting. I know it's been just under 2 weeks but I'm absolutely puzzled why I'm not losing any weight... I would have expected to lose a bit by now.

I took off my bodycam, clocked out and quit on the spot (UK) ","Vent, I work as a security guard at my local Aldi. My role involves confronting shop lifters, removing abusive customers making safety inspections of fire exits and equipment, and guarding valuable stock.  
The above incident occurred after a pattern of behaviors of:

* Belittling me in front of customers and colleagues for not doing enough patrols,
* Chastising me for following company procedure by calling the non-emergency police number to remove an aggressive beggar was smoking in the store, drinking stolen wine and intimidating staff and customers while disregarding my authority (I am forbidden to physically restrain or remove a suspect unless they are being physically violent) and did as I was instructed.
* Timing my bathroom, meal, and coffee breaks

Yesterday I took a bathroom break outside my assigned unpaid lunch break. 'YOU SHOULD GO ON YOUR BREAKS. HAVE YOU BEEN GOING ON COMPANY TIME?' Not just pulling me up but screaming at me aggressively with volume. Considering I didn't get to have my full lunch hour that day as I had been called out to deal with an incident I was quite miffed.

I mentioned that he had been in the breakroom as long as I had but I don't say anything and he bellowed 'IT'S NOT YOUR JOB TO MONITOR MY BREAKS. IT'S MY JOB TO MONITOR YOUR BREAKS! I'M YOUR BOSS!'

'Not anymore you're not.' and I took off my body cam and earpiece and clocked out. He followed me down the hall and said 'You've got a bad attitude'. No, I have self respect.

The irony of my position being to handle aggression and conflict is not lost on me. However, I expect that from shop lifters and customers, not from my colleagues. I need them to back me up and help me with my job as I help them with theirs. Not only did he micromanage my breaks which is a red flag, he aggressively yelled at me for performing basic bodily needs. That is fostering a toxic work environment of humiliation and intimidation and I don't appreciate it.

If they are disappointed with my performance they can pull me into their office for a meeting or discuss my performance with my boss. I do not accept screaming as a form of constructive criticism.

Considering the danger I have to put myself in to protect staff, customers and property for minimum wage and what I contribute to the company I demand some respect.

I went home and recorded the incident in my resignation letter 'effective immediately'. My manager offered me shifts at another store but I declined. It's for the best for everyone involved I retire from front line customer facing security. I am now focusing on office based work like CCTV.",73,1729863712.0,antiwork,4,0.97,False

I'm a prospective student and was wondering what it's like as an undergraduate studying astronomy (I'm interested in exoplanets so feel free to provide any info specific to that concentration if you happen to have experience):

1. I'm getting the impression that most astronomy students major in Physics and not EAPS. What are some differences between student/research experience at the two departments?
2. Are research/internship positions hard to acquire? How do you interact with professors in a research context? (e.g. mostly virtually, in a lab, in a coffee shop, etc.)
3. To what extent do you collaborate with other undergrads/grads in research?
4. To what extent do you collaborate with people from other institutions (Space Telescope, APL, NASA Goddard, etc.)?
5. Is it easy to pursue a double major? Which ones are most convenient, and which ones would be most useful?
6. What cool things does your department/research group do? (anything you enjoy or think is unique to JHU)
7. Is it hard to balance coursework with research?

I also have a few questions about the general JHU experience for those who don't have experience in Astronomy:

8. Is it hard to audition into the symphony orchestra? If I want to continue music as a side hobby, how much will I get to play at Peabody (private lessons, orchestra rehearsals, etc.)

9. What are your favorite spots to study/hang out, and why? (can be on or off campus)

Overwhelmed by my sudden rush of emotions, I hurried downstairs before he could leave the closet, trying to appear busy. I grabbed a cloth and began wiping the kitchen counter, even though it was spotless.

¬†

A minute passed, and I heard him come down the stairs. Keeping my back to him, I continued cleaning, hoping to avoid any interaction. Relief washed over me when I heard the front door open and close. He didn‚Äôt say anything.

¬†

I needed a job‚Äîsomething to save up for law school in Seattle. I remembered a caf√© just down the street. Maybe it was time to venture out and try my luck there.

¬†

I pulled on a light purple sleeveless top with thin straps, paired it with my favorite jeans, and tied my hair into a high ponytail. Grabbing my phone, I stepped outside for the first time since I arrived.

¬†

The fresh air was a welcome change, and a gentle breeze tickled my skin as I walked down the street. The overcast sky mirrored my mood, but for a moment, I found comfort in the simple beauty of it all. Soon, I arrived at the caf√©: Love & Coffee.

¬†

Suppressing the urge to judge the name, I took a deep breath and pushed the glass door open. The warm scent of coffee and pastries enveloped me, instantly soothing my nerves. The caf√©‚Äôs simple elegance, with its white and brown d√©cor, felt inviting.

¬†

The counter was busy, but I managed to squeeze into the line. When it was my turn, I approached the girl taking orders. ‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù I stammered, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm...looking for a part-time job. Could I...speak to the manager?‚Äù

The afternoon drifted into a quiet hum of activity as the caf√© began to fill up. Atlas sent me out to serve water to the new arrivals, and I was so focused on not spilling a single drop that I didn‚Äôt even glance up at the table.

As I placed the glasses down, a voice broke through my concentration‚Äîone I hadn‚Äôt heard in years. ""Drea?""

My heart stuttered. There, standing before me, was Adrian. After all these years. Alive. My throat tightened as emotion surged. ""Adrian?""

Tears stung my eyes as we stared at each other, neither of us daring to move, still trying to grasp the reality that he was standing there, whole and unharmed.

‚ÄúDrea!"" He quickly stepped forward, gripping my hand as if afraid I might vanish. ""I can't believe you're here!""

He was back. After three long years of wondering, worrying, and sleepless nights, he was really here. My mind raced with a thousand questions, emotions twisting inside me.

""You should be saying that to me! You disappeared without a word!"" My voice wavered, an odd mix of anger, relief, and disbelief. ""I didn't have your number, I didn't know if you were okay. I thought‚Äî""

‚ÄúMessed up?‚Äù I scoffed, hurt and frustration boiling over. ""I lost my best friend, Adrian. I was alone!""

His head dropped, and he whispered, ""I‚Äôm so sorry, Drea. I promise, I‚Äôm not going anywhere again.""

The soft clearing of a throat interrupted us, and I realized we weren‚Äôt alone. A woman sat nearby, cradling a baby boy in her arms, and a little girl perched next to her, wide-eyed and curious. They all watched us with mild curiosity.

Adrian looked over and rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. ‚ÄúOh, right. Drea, this is my wife, Darcy. And these are my kids‚ÄîIsla and Josh.‚Äù

I blinked, trying to process the words. His wife? Kids? ‚ÄúOh... hi,‚Äù I managed, giving them an awkward wave. Darcy smiled warmly, while Isla waved back with the enthusiasm only a child could muster.

I shot Adrian a confused glance. Aunt Drea?

Adrian grinned. ‚ÄúYes, Isla. This is Aunt Drea.‚Äù

Before I could react further, I heard Atlas calling me back to the kitchen, pulling me away from the whirlwind of emotions I was feeling.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll catch up with you later, Adrian,‚Äù I said hurriedly, dashing back inside.

The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur, with Adrian‚Äôs family lingering for Isla‚Äôs birthday cake. We exchanged polite smiles, but I knew we needed more time to really talk about everything that had happened. There was too much to say, too many questions I still had.

Hours later, after my shift had ended, I stepped out of the caf√© and mentally kicked myself. I‚Äôd forgotten to get Adrian‚Äôs number. Again. How could I be so ridiculous? After all these years, I still hadn‚Äôt managed to ask for his contact details.

Just as I was internally scolding myself, I collided with someone outside.

‚ÄúWant to take a walk?‚Äù

Without thinking, I agreed. We strolled through the streets, avoiding any route near my house. I didn‚Äôt want Sorin to know about this. Not yet.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù Adrian‚Äôs voice cut through the silence, a teasing note in his tone. ‚ÄúYou got married.‚Äù

I shot him a sideways glance. ‚ÄúHow do you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúReally? It was all over the news. Didn‚Äôt you see it?‚Äù

I fiddled with my fingers, nerves bubbling to the surface. ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù

He laughed softly, shaking his head. ‚ÄúYeah. To Sorin Zaveri, no less. I was shocked but also happy for you. You‚Äôve always loved him, Drea. Seems like your dream came true.‚Äù

His excitement was palpable, but his words only made my chest tighten. I couldn‚Äôt lie to him. Not after everything we‚Äôd been through.

I swallowed hard and stopped walking, staring down at my feet. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not real, Adrian.‚Äù

His brow furrowed as he halted beside me. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ a business deal,‚Äù I whispered, feeling the weight of the truth crash down. ‚ÄúMy parents married me off to save their company. Sorin hates me.‚Äù

I wiped at my eyes, fighting back the tears. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay, Adrian. I am. I‚Äôve learned to deal with it.‚Äù

I placed a gentle hand on his arm. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault. You couldn‚Äôt have known.‚Äù

After a long silence, Adrian offered to walk me home, but I declined. The last thing I needed was Sorin seeing us together and making assumptions.

When I finally reached the house, I tried to unlock the door, but the code wouldn‚Äôt work. Sorin had changed it. I knocked several times, but there was no response. Defeated, I sat down on the doorstep, scrolling through old photos of him. His smile in those pictures always made my heart ache.

Suddenly, his voice startled me. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing out here?‚Äù

I jumped, my phone slipping from my grasp. Sorin stood over me, his face unreadable as he bent to pick it up. He glanced at the screen, which displayed a picture of him, and his expression changed‚Äîthough I couldn‚Äôt quite tell how.

Without a word, he handed my phone back. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you just come inside?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe door‚Ä¶ it wouldn‚Äôt open,‚Äù I stammered.

Sorin frowned, stepping forward to test the lock. After a moment, he sighed in frustration. ‚ÄúDid you try using your fingerprint?‚Äù

I bit my lip, guilt written all over my face.

He sighed. ‚ÄúUnbelievable. Now we‚Äôre locked out.‚Äù He pulled out his phone, pacing away to make a call for help.

When he returned, he sat down beside me, though he made sure to keep some distance. The silence between us stretched on as we waited for someone to fix the lock, and I couldn‚Äôt help but sneak a glance at him.

I wished, just for once, he‚Äôd let me in‚Äîboth literally and figuratively.

A Great adventure","In late September, I flew my self-built Bafang Mid-Drive Merida Presido 1 to Osaka, purchasing 2 13 Ah batteries on the ground there.   
I spent 21 days touring, with 16 cycling days solo, and Vital Stats are included in the images.   
I broke a spoke, a pair of pedals, my rear rack, one of my pannier bags, one tube and one chain. I stayed in businessman hotels and ate at restaurants, I was not on a budget of sort any as it was a holiday, where I used the bike as my transport. Furthermore, I have never toured for more than 3 days before, so just decided to go for it and hope it went well. The Distances are from Strava and measured on Apple Watch, It turns out a lot of the tunnels were subtracted because there's no GPS inside the mountains, my Bikes' computer thinks I lost around 60km in total from actual. 

**Day 1 - Osaka to Omihachiman - 106 km, 362m elevation.** Started along the Yodo River, and then over the ""mountains"" to Otsu, then following the eastern coast of Lake Biwa, it was 33 degrees and very humid, but Pocari sweat is the solution to many of life's problems. I had planned an extra rest day here, in the event I needed to tune the bike after the first day or needed to make any changes to the set-up. The Bollards on the Yodo River path ruined my speed and broke one of my Panniers.

**Day 2 - Omihachiman to Tsuruga - 96 km, 404m elevation.** Continuing along Lake Biwa to Nagahama for a lunch stop and browse, before my first (of MANY) Japanese Tunnels heading over the Coastal Mountains, encountering my first ever rain while E-Touring. The Poncho was effective as the rain wasn't too heavy, and I arrived in Tsuruga early. Touring Ramen Road and the Matsumoto street art to add in a few extra Km.

**Day 3 - Tsuruga to Kanazawa - 163 km, 663m elevation.** This was my longest day in sheer distance, and luckily I woke up before the sun, smashed some Famichicken and In‚Ñ¢ and arrived in Kanazawa for a late lunch. Leaving Tsuruga I encountered many tunnels, and a lot of roadworks on the coast road and the cycle path, mostly earthquake induced sadly, this near shook me apart a few times and there were a few difficult to follow detours, but I made it mostly intact.

**Day 4 - Kanazawa to Toyama - 156 km, 723m elevation.** I had a few beers in Kanazawa and had to back it up with a long haul through beautiful coastal and mountain roads to Toyama. I left Kanazawa with the morning traffic which was a little frustrating but Japanese drivers are used to cyclists, so it went well, Highlights were the Noto peninsula area and the  God Bowl of Ramen in Himi. I also spent a couple of nights in Toyama and this is where I had to replace my pedals and chain. (they had 3000 km on them already before the trip)

**Day 5 - Toyama to Takayama - 86 km, 1463m elevation.** Ascending into the Alps in the driving rain. I put on the full wet kit and this is the day my rear rack started to fail. But duct tape and cable ties can work wonders when needed. This was astoundingly beautiful, on the mod route descent Strava says I got up to 73km/h which is terrifying in retrospect, but it was just gorgeous.

**Day 6 - Takayama to Okaya - 104 km, 2477m elevation.** This was a beautiful day as well, but incredibly challenging with just pedal assist. The Crossing of the Abo pass at, 1790m-plus led to a switch back descent filled with monkeys hanging out on the road. The road quality was atrocious, but the scenery made up for it. There was no pub in Okaya.

**Day 7 Okaya to Kofu - 84 km, 428m elevation.** Around lake Suwa in the morning, then joining the national route 20. Mostly road riding all the way to Kofu, I started to notice my shifting was a not working as well as I wanted and was worried I had bent my derailleur hanger, but the bike shop in Kofu said it was fine..... 

**Day 8 Kofu to Fuji - 70 km, 888m elevation.** The climb up to the Shoji Tunnel was spectacular again, a little damp and misty on great quality roads. This was meant to be longer, but 35 Km in just after my first views of Fuji San exiting the tunnel, my rear frame failed in its entirety. More cable ties and jockey straps and just bolting my panniers to myself. I covered 25 more Km to a bike store where heavy maintenance at low cost was undertaken. The shifting was also diagnosed, as resulting from the pannier sitting too low and interfering with my cable. I had a couple of nights in Fuji to recover. 

**Day 9 Fuji to Omaezaki - 116 km, 503m elevation.** Today, I wish I had studied more Japanese. A bunch more sections of the pacific cycling path were being renovated and led to detours, one particular detour was not marked in English so after a stunning lunch at West Coast Brewing, I rode 8km out to a road that had fallen into the ocean and had to backtrack and take another tunnel with trucks, moments later the valve on my rear tube failed, so I swapped it out and pumped it up with the tiniest pump that I brought with me. The scenery was still spectacular and the heat was back

**Day 10 - Omaezaki to Irago - 126km, 668m elevation.** Once again, the pacific cycling route had several detours and a section of terrible mud that meant I had to have my bike professionally cleaned before coming home. There's a lot of earthquake damage down there, but the last 5Km was so spectacular coming into sunset. The seafood in Irago also added to the wonderful afternoon.

**Day 11 - Toba to Nara - 149 km, 1042m elevation**. I took the early morning Ferry to Toba and then set off with mixed city riding and countryside riding. Once I hit Tsu and turned west, it got steep! The ride up and the descent were pretty great, and once I passed the Iga plateau it was a pretty cruisy afternoon into Nara where I spent 2 nights, (there were too many things I wanted to eat, and I needed to wash my clothes)

**Day 12 - Nara to Kobe - 82 km, 500m elevation.** Left late so I could make it to a second god bowl of Ramen at Ramen house Mitsuba which doesn't open until 10:30 on weekdays. Climbing up to the Shijonawate pass was all the effort of the day, except we were back on the Yodo River and the Bollards were back. Went over to Rokk≈ç island for a beer and rode the rest of the way with the motor off assist (I was on the first battery and thought changing for 5km would be a waste.) went a bit wild and rewarded myself with the biggest meal of the trip.

**Day 13 - Kobe to Fukuchiyama - 102 km, 1156m elevation**. I front loaded the climbs on this one, by the time I got to Arima Onsen 25Km in I had already done 800m climbing over Mount Rokk≈ç. I went for a bath at the golden onsen and then headed off suburban riding into Fukuchiyama, there was a little bit of rain as I arrived but not enough for the wets to come out. 

**Day 14 - Fukuchiyama to Obama - 100 km, 525m elevation**. This day started amazing, there was a layer of damp on the ground after the overnight rain and the road quality was amazing. Then 8km in, a spoke snapped on the back wheel and the wheel came untrue, while I could replace a spoke, I couldn't easily true a wheel so off to Cycle Base Asahi, I went for coffee while they trued my wheel, then I set off again, lunch at Factory Jaws zero, and I was feeling a little down after the spoke, but when I hit Maizuru the road became borderline perfect. Yes, there were a few roadworks locations, but it was joyous. I got into Obama just on golden hour to visit the statue of the former president, then eat so much sushi that I slept weird.

**Day 15 - Obama to Otsu - 108km, 595m elevation.** This was a good day. I left with the sun, so I could get to Myotsu-ji while the mist was still everywhere. I spent a half hour taking in my moments of zen entirely alone in the temple grounds, I then crossed over the ridgeway to come back to the shores of Lake Biwa again, this time on the West coast. I then visited Omi brewing and then the most amazing water hall at Ukimi-do. Rolling into the Ishiyama part of Otsu early to prep for my last day cycling.

**Day 16 - Otsu to Osaka - 80km, 168m elevation**. This was the best leg of the trip, A few trucks, but otherwise I had the road to myself, winding along the Seta river amongst mountains and forest,  almost all a descent. Arriving in Uji just in time for Match and Sencha morning tea before rejoining the Yodo river and our bollards, but at this point i didn't care so much, the ride was near perfect. Ending in Umeda with ramen, beer and a visit to the Umeda Sky.

1gbu414,https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/1gbu414/astronomy_at_mit/,Astronomy at MIT?,"Hi! I'm a prospective student and was wondering what it's like as an undergraduate in the Astronomy program (I'm interested in exoplanets so feel free to provide any info specific to that concentration if you happen to have experience):

1. Are research/internship positions hard to acquire? How do you interact with professors in a research context? (e.g. mostly virtually, in a lab, in a coffee shop, etc.)
2. To what extent do you collaborate with other undergrads/grads in research?
3. To what extent do you collaborate with people from other institutions (Harvard, SAO, etc.)?
4. Is it easy to pursue a double major? Which ones are most convenient, and which ones would be most useful?
5. What cool things does your department/research group do? (anything you enjoy or think is unique to MIT, for example I know that EAPS drops pumpkins off their roof)
6. Is it hard to balance coursework with research? Do you find yourself working with other undergrads in your department to complete psets?

I also have a few questions about the general MIT experience for those who don't have experience in Astronomy:

7. What's it like being in the wind ensemble vs. the symphony orchestra? (I play the clarinet)

8. What are your favorite spots to study/hang out, and why? (can be on or off campus)

I understand that a lot of these questions are super niche so feel free to talk about any adjacent experiences as well! Thanks in advance üôè",1,1729862490.0,mit,1,0.6,False

The name of the game today? Upside reversal. I know, I know - another Friday, another green hopium post? I'm not here to say MOASS is today, but we really do have a significant number of structural factors present in the options data and our technicals that suggest we have a green day. Skip to the end if you want to see them enumerated and then come and luxuriate in the sweet, sweet data - Let's go!

**Price Movement Recap**

[10\/24 Trading Day 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/0hhd0imwawwd1.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=8521e298a613b5c5c897acd41645d913cbd0cb0b)

Yesterday's price action was almost an exact repeat of Wednesday's, a scrub-a-dub-dub up, down, and then back up the $20.50-$21 tight trading range we've seen configured in the MM gamma hedge landscape. Without any real changes to that landscape discernible premarket yesterday, this fit exactly with predictions:

[Post URL: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/comments\/1gb1tcs\/institutions\_setting\_up\_for\_920\_requel\_gme\_1024\/](https://preview.redd.it/pgwdl3vdbwwd1.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=56187c29be25952e3b4723e44465f73513ba6800)

12:30pm EDT represented our inflection point on the day flipped more bullish and the stock closed at $20.63 for a white daily candle finish - our second such finish in 12 trading days on an absolute trickle of 2.6mil shares traded. Total options premiums were biased only slightly toward bearish bets by the end of the day.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

Although Max Pain for this week is still sitting at $20.50, we do have some bullish OI movement that suggests we have stabilized and can move to the upside today and close above that level. Let's look at our 10/25 OI Changes:

[10\/25 OI Changes 10\/24-10\/25](https://preview.redd.it/vks1lk15ewwd1.png?width=1861&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ea70e0baf65c5068e9dab331ba875d68d76317b)

1. Puts came off the board in modest, but not insignificant numbers. More than a few traders decided their upside on these contracts was tapped out yesterday. 2) We had very large Call OI expansions at $20.50 and $21. These two factors eliminated the negative net gamma character of the $20.50 gamma position. It looks like that volume on $21 Calls was primarily bearish (61% at the bid) and, thus, is a trader's short call position:

https://preview.redd.it/2jgtumokfwwd1.png?width=901&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7d74b95e1ca5683033911efb4a3156f373c2ec6

This is essentially a bet that the stock price will finish today's trading below $21.15, which isn't an reasonable bet. This trader is already up about 40%. The $20.50s were about dead even and a mix between bullish and bearish volume:

https://preview.redd.it/h389lbmffwwd1.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e7b84ed2666ef67005b187e4f6d56db22c67a87

Interestingly, both the bigger bears here and the later bull are up on their positions as of close.

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/rtuzghvkgwwd1.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab8fbf3d7e853b9195906026026a687a0b7c8b84

And here our Gamma Exposure data is showing us that stability prefigured by the OI changes heading into today's expiry. Even a low-volume, boring options environment today will still move us up listingly toward $21 (though such conditions will be vulnerable to interventive shorting and price manipulation if someone wants to keep things pegged closer to $20.50).

At the same time, however, we've got our $21, $21.50, and $22 strikes with significantly accumulated call gamma. While in low volume conditions, this structure forms a brick wall of MM hedging that keeps organic price action pinned beneath it, a informational disruption of our otherwise placid conditions can rocket the price up this range along a gamma ramp as IV increases and MM hedging algorithms are forced to buy shares in order to account for the increasing probabilities that these strikes will close in the money.

With IV having been extremely low all week and so much of our total gamma concentrated at these strikes close to the money, MMs are likely minimally hedged with respect to these positions in terms of long shares based on the low ITM probability calculations.

Not a sure thing, but if a big enough player wants to play bull with this dynamic, there is money to be made.

**Technicals**

The star of the 1-day chart is obviously the white candle at the end of a five day sell-off trend heading into a weekly expiry (compare the white Tuesday candle from 10/8). RSI is sub-neutral, MACD has been showing selloff, and yet IV overall ticked UP yesterday. We also double-bottomed on our post-September ATM new bottom at around $20.50. This certainly forecasts a short-term, local reversal within our trading range and looks to at least two-day trend up into 10/29 (National Cat Day). Certainly if we get a run today - even up through $21 - we can expect some bullishness on Monday not only as the trend continues, but as T+1 Settlement buying comes in during the day account for the bullish-versus-Max-Pain EOW close.

**IV Trends**

[10-Day Mean Implied Volatility](https://preview.redd.it/pejt4mbzjwwd1.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=c443ee5e79d7845ac0e686aac8bc85d240038ec7)

This two-day average uptick versus our trend in IV levels is a bit noteworthy. It's still pretty small, obviously, in the overall frame of things, but it is somewhat out of sorts with our trading activity. The price has gone nowhere - literally it rehearsed the same trading range (and a little tighter at both ends) two days in a row on back to back days of sub 3mil volume (2.9mil and 2.6mil respectively) while also heading into a very tight, very heavily Call Gamma bound trading range. Yet, IV opened yesterday at 80% and closed yesterday above 74% after touching 69% intraday multiple times early in the week. Something in the IV algorithm thus picks up that our conditions project a slightly higher chance of upward volatility in the very short term based on factors disconnected from these - I suspect double bottoming and not penetrating much below $20.50.

**Synthesis¬†+ TA;DR**

We're looking at current conditions indicative of a Friday upside reversal:

1. The Negative Gamma Exposure position at $20.50 has flipped positive.
2. We have a high concentration of Net Positive Gamma Exposure at adjacent strikes immediately above our price position.
3. Volume and IV have been in the dirt all week so MMs are minimally hedged with respect to those positions heading into today's trading.
4. We had two carbon copy bearish-neutral days dig into the floor of our trading bracket with yesterday's trading yielding a white daily candle. Despite this, IV levels have increased on average for the past two days despite no meaningful price movement and volume downtrend.

What to watch out for:

1. Necessary volume uptick on the tail of a bullish options or share catalyst (500k shares bought in a minute, $500k dropped on ITM calls, $500k in ATM Puts sold, etc). \[Bullish\]
2. A piece of news dropped without any real meaning that gets routed to the GME newsfeed. \[Bullish\]
3. Interventive shorting - i.e. 200k shares dumped on the ticker in 1-2min without any traceability in the data to kill organic options market-directed price appreciation. This won't be enough to kill the reversal, but it can 'mute' its dynamism depending on the strength of the intraday catalyst. Obviously, if the catalyst is a DFV tweet or something similar, then bear r f\*cq, but you know.

Keep an eye out, don't bet the farm, Cat Day cometh, and Good luck out there!

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER:¬†These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I never hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.",93,1729862445.0,Superstonk,22,0.93,False
1gbu2nj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1gbu2nj/4_shots_in_crazy_weekend_ahead_of_me_a_little/,4 shots in! Crazy weekend ahead of me- a little nervous but feeling good!,"I tagged this NSV because I had some
NSVs and this isn‚Äôt necessarily a rant- just appreciate everyone‚Äôs support here.

I‚Äôm 4 shots in. I‚Äôve lost approximately 10 pounds of what I imagine is water weight and inflammation. I have not touched the school
Secretary‚Äôs candy drawer or the snacks I keep for my students in almost a month. I also haven‚Äôt had alcohol and have severely cut back my coffee (I was at Dunkin Donuts every day with a coffee that was at least 300 calories and a breakfast sandwich). (I think those changes along helped immensely).  I‚Äôm finding I don‚Äôt crave sugar anymore and I just don‚Äôt want it. I feel more comfortable in my skin and I‚Äôve felt better going to the gym.

My frustrations have surrounded some
nausea that I get occasionally and some stomach pain- but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs just me not eating enough or eating things that just don‚Äôt agree (learned a rough lesson with peanut butter/peanut products yesterday!) my endurance has also taken a hit for running and strength training. I get tired pretty quickly and need more breaks and my heart rate jumps up more quickly than I would like so I have to learn to manage that better (that being said- the movement of running and doing certain moves at the gym ‚Äúfeels better‚Äù like I‚Äôm not jiggling things around. I‚Äôm experiencing less joint pain too which is nice. The Zep has also helped me with some food choices I found difficult to follow through on before because of cravings (like avoiding gluten on a more frequent basis). 

Been making sure to get at least 100 grams of
protein a day, drinking 80-100 oz of water, and utilizing a collagen powder with pre/pro biotics. Bathroom habits are a little funky and still working to settle that. 

I‚Äôve bought some clothes in a style  that I wouldn‚Äôt have purchased before and I‚Äôm just feeling more confident. 

The tough part: I‚Äôm going on a trip to Las Vegas this weekend (on the plane now!) and nervous about getting through the weekend and how my body is going to react. I will take it easy with drinks and food- but still a little nervous. We get back Sunday night pretty late (I usually take my shot on Sunday night) but I‚Äôll be moving up to 5. Next weekend I‚Äôm in Disney for the Wine & Dine races so I‚Äôll have a 5K, 10k, and Half Marathon to run. Unsure how I‚Äôll respond to 5 and what my food intake will be like (sometimes I struggle to get to 1400-1500 calories because I‚Äôm not always hungry and get a little bit of food aversion). Plan on taking that shot on Monday night because I really don‚Äôt want to travel with it and I feel like 1 day won‚Äôt make a difference.

If you made it this far- thanks for reading. I appreciate this community and everyone‚Äôs
input.

1gbu014,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Frosty_Incident666/comments/1gbu014/oc_an_old_ship_eulogy_iii_jyx/,[OC] An old ship (Eulogy III) [jyx],"Glububit had decided to join the strange human. Of all species in the galaxy, only the Shrrrebit would call humans by one of the many names they had for themselves - depending on what kind of human had adopted them and which human language they spoke. The human who had taken care of her - a wholly unremarkable woman who had come to FUSS to escape the Nation of United Terran States debt collectors - was one that spoke Enklisk, thus, Glububit had learned this language growing up. Not without troubles, considering how slow of a language it was, but she found solace in the art form of musical poetry, in which the humans spoke much faster than usual. She had also learned a mighty barrage of insults and slurs from said style of poetry.

It was a sad thing for the Shrrrebit that their own language and culture were mostly lost to time, with the majority of records being provided by FUSS and especially the fleet-ship Theseus, who were not always known to give the most accurate account of historical events. Although most historians preferred the FUSS version of history more than that of the Nation of United Terran States, stating that the latter was an ""amalgamation of corporate and governmental propaganda, where one would have to dig deep only to find not a single seed of truth to the matter investigated"". Of course those who stated such things would have done so *after* leaving the Sol system. The Shrrrebit, so far, were unable to produce a common language as everybody had different ideas of how it should be like - depending, of course, in large parts on what human language they had learned.

She walked on besides the human, Cook, towards his ship. He said that this ship was gifted to him by a Rakhar, who had grown old and weary, eventually passing into the wall. The weird thing about it was that all four of his hearts malfunctioned at exactly the same time, an autopsy revealing that ""the caffeine in his body was a multitude of that which a Rakhar would normally be able to tolerate, compounded by further substances known to be psychoactive to the Rakhar species"". Word on the streets of FUSS was that ""it wasn't the coffee that did him in, or any of the other stuff, but some shocking news or event that triggered his quick demise"", something which could not be confirmed. Anyways, Cook had briefly met this Rakhar, and upon stating that he wanted to go on adventures like he had originally intended when boarding the Voyager One, the Rakhar gifted him his ship. Why Cook did not know, but the Rakhar did mention a common cosmic friend, implying that it knew of Cooks sacrifice.

Glububit looked upon the ship: It was...strange. While it had some cannons which must have been powerful for their time, they seemed to have barely seen any use. One could not say the same for the hull - it appeared that the ship had been fired at more than once. On its side Glububit noticed two giant thrusters, which also must've been outdated by now, as she was used to smaller ones. In-between these, on the back of the ship, she noticed five more *things* that seemed like some sort of propulsion system, or rather a multiple thereof, all connected through a series of pipes and wires. The way they were weird together seemed compact, but extremely complicated. Walking around it she noticed a faded decal on the ships of what appeared to be a naked human man facing an extended middle finger protruding from the heavens, the barely recognizable words ""The Man"" written underneath it. Glububit wondered why a Rakhar would have found this kind of decal appropriate, but she wouldn't be able to ask somebody who had already passed away. Maybe it just disliked humans?

""A real beauty, isn't he?"" Cook proclaimed, his gaze meandering over the ship.

""He? I thought you humans always say *she* when referring to a ship?"" Glububit was confused.

""Not this one. This one is *The Man.* Used to be one of the main ships, if not the main ship, of *Tythors Trading and Translocation Emporium*. Although that company doesn't exist anymore...not in the form that it used to, anwyays."" Cook explained, ""I think some guys daughter took it over? Weird thing, really. Appearantly this Tythor fellow signed over his company to some human friend of his. From what I hear the intended course of action was that the human would sign it back to him at some point. Only thing was, Tythor relatively soon after passed away, his company still being under legal ownership of that other guy, who worked for the Space Hazard Acquisition Forces of Terra. On one mission, I've been told, a fast traveling loose screw hit him right in the head. Must've been over pretty quick for him. *He had a few screws loose and a loose screw did him in.* That's what they wrote onto that wall of theirs, I think? Thus, the company went to his living relatives, mainly some couple from *Hell's Retreat.* That man had specified in his will that it should be owned by his daughter, *in the unlikely case that both he and Tythor passed away before it could be signed back to Tythor,* who wasn't of age yet at the time, so the company got managed by the couple and for some reason I don't quite understand, the leader of a Grrkrk nomad tribe and a royal Jyxition. What's even more unusual is that the Jyxition and the Grrkrk got along quite well."".

""I thought those two don't like each other that much? The Grrkrk and the Jyx?"" Glububit asked confused.

""They had their history"" Cook sighed, ""but thanks to the efforts of that royal Jyxiton and that leader, they've made progress towards mutual understanding. I can't remember those Jyx names for the heck of it. The Theseus just call it *Princess*. From what I hear she was apparently married to fleet-ships captain of the time, who was also a Jyxiton. Anyways, we'll know more once we visit *Hell's Retreat*. I hear my cosmic friend is there, who decided to stay there for a while after the deaths of both the Rakhar and the man."".

""I heard the captain of the time was a human"" Glububit responded, not knowing what to make of this information.

""Well...it's the Theseus. If you dig deep enough in the archives, I'm sure you'd be able to find out"" Cook replied in seemingly deep thought, ""but let's not be too preoccupied with the past"".

Cook went through a checklist that the previous owner had left him. In big letters, circled in red, impossible to miss it read ""4. Engage anti-gravity device BEFORE powering up thrusters"". To Cooks knowledge, nobody ever died from flying this ship, but it was good to have it written down. He then started to think about technology itself and how different it could be even in between systems of the same species, thinking back to his time on the Voyager One, and how far it had all progressed in the last millennia. Once, space travel was new and exciting. Nowadays, it was considered mostly mundane, its only saving grace being that the universe was so vast there was always the opportunity to stumble across something interesting.

Glububit, meanwhile, waited until they were in space and then decided to take a look around the ship. The previous owner must have had an obsession with cleanliness, considering how clean the showers on the ship were. The ones that the human didn't use. She came across what appeared to be an office: An imposing desk, with a type of throne that elevated one person upon the other on one side, and a simple chair on the opposite side. ""This Tythor must have been a quite pretentious person"" she thought to herself, noticing a mug on the table, which was in desperate need of some cleaning. Since she had no other way to thank the human for the adventure, she decided to do so and went back to the cockpit afterwards.

On her way back she marbled on the many different types of material the ship was constructed of. Especially the wooden accents stood out, as the only planets that produced this type of material were Terra in the Sol system and the Terran-Shrrrebit planet in the FUSS system, making the material extremely valuable in the bigger scheme of things.  The latter of which was covered in dense vegetation ever since she could remember, not believing the stories that it was once ""a hellishly sterile rock floating through space, only made habitable by the collective efforts of the fleet-ship Theseus"". There were some spots where the canopy opened up to the skies, which were quickly zoned as ""holy groves"" and ""recreational areas"", where worshipers of all religions represented on the planet would congregate - sometimes their ceremonies being disturbed by people who'd participate in recreation at those sites.

""I found this cup in that old office"" she told Cook, ""and cleaned it"".

""Never been in there, really. Only to look around, once...I find it a bit...pretentious?"" Cook replied looking at the cup, ""must've forgotten about it. It's fine. I have more than enough tableware, this thing used be a caf√© after all. You can have it."". Glububit thanked Cook for the gift and thought about how nice a warm cup of her favorite tea would be. ""Have you put the kettle on?"" the human asked when noticing distinct smell of warm beverage.

""No...I did not."" Glububit answered, noticing the cup warming up her hands, which it should not have considering it was empty. ""Uhm...Cook?"" she muttered as she looked down at it, ""...uhm...I swear I didn't make any tea or anything. But the cup just filled itself?""

""Ridiculous"" Cook replied, ""even when I was in the cosmic sentience, we always waited for the ship to bring us more ingredients. You can't tell me it just comes out of nowhere!""

""No....that's exactly what I'm telling you. I just sat here. And I thought about how nice a cup of tea would be now. And now there's..."" she took a sip, ""...*exactly* what I imagined in it. It's perfect. Right temperature, right taste, everything!"". Cook didn't believe her. ""I know! Wait a second!"" she said, before going to the old caf√© and getting another mug, pouring in the tea that had appeared out of nowhere. ""You try it"", she exclaimed handing the offending porcelain to him.

""Alright, if you insist. I'd like...hm...hot chocolate. With a marshmallow"" Cook said somewhat sarcastically while looking at the tableware, which again began to fill itself out of nowhere. ""I'll be damned"" he muttered in disbelief, ""I may have lived inside a cosmic sentience for a long time, but I never knew things like this were possible!"". They enjoyed their beverages, although Glububit was a bit annoyed that now her perfect tea was getting cold, while Cook teased her stating that ""his hot chocolate stayed the exact right temperature"".

Just a moment before they were done, the ships announcement system spoke in a soft human voice, although Glububit couldn't figure out what accent it was supposed to be: ""Ze ship iz readi foa atmospheric re-entri. Pleaze zecure urselfs and enzure zat ur A.G.G. unit iz funczional "".",1,1729862185.0,u_Frosty_Incident666,0,1.0,False

Rose Sharp tossed on the plush hotel bed, another sleepless night in another soulless room. This time it was the Shangri-La in Vancouver, but it could have been anywhere. Her mind drifted to the private jet that brought her here, the wall of security that whisked her from tarmac to hotel. Like a prisoner transfer, not a star's arrival.



She scrolled through her phone, each comment cutting deeper than the last. ""Spoiled brat."" ""Lost touch with reality."" ""Must be nice in your ivory tower."" They didn't understand. How could they? The isolation, the constant scrutiny, every breath analyzed and commodified. Sure, she had everything - except the simple freedom to exist.



She thought back to this morning's landing. The Canadian air felt different, somehow crisp, fresh, colder than in the south. But she'd barely gotten to taste it before being hustled into the waiting SUV. ""Security concerns,"" Marcus had said, like he always did. Everything was a security concern.



Tomorrow was the last show. BC Place would be packed, sixty thousand voices screaming her name. They'd sing her lyrics back to her, thinking they knew her soul because they knew her songs. None of them seeing the scared ‚Äúlittle rich girl‚Äù who'd never learned how to be normal. Who'd grown up with vocal coaches instead of friends, with choreographers instead of confidants.



The walls of the presidential suite felt like they were closing in. She had everything money could buy, and nothing that mattered. Even her rare moments of rebellion were scheduled, approved, sanitized for public consumption. ""Controlled spontaneity,"" her management called it.



\*Fuck it. Fuck all of it.\*



She grabbed a baseball cap from her suitcase - plain, black, nothing designer. Pulled it low over her eyes. Changed into simple jeans and a t-shirt. No makeup. Just a girl who wanted a soda from the corner store. Was that too much to ask? Just one normal moment?



Her hand trembled on the door handle. Security would be outside, they always were. But when she cracked it open - empty hallway. For once, timing was on her side. The elevator would let her slip out unnoticed. Just a quick trip, the map on her phone said three blocks. Something real.



Three blocks away, Jimmy Silver's apartment was dark except for the flickering TV. Local news droned on about something he couldn't focus on. His mind bounced between the half-empty six pack on his coffee table and memories he'd rather forget. Four beers in, the old urges were getting louder.



He'd been good lately. Kept the rules he'd made for himself. Never more than six beers. Never hard liquor. Never drinking alone at the bar. But four deep, staring at those last two bottles, the rules felt more like suggestions. The same way they had back when he was training, when one drink became two became blackout became waking up wondering what he'd done this time.



His glory days felt like someone else's life now. Canadian Olympic boxing hopeful. The next great thing. Headlines in the sports pages, sponsors lined up. All pissed away one bottle at a time. Now he bounced at Riley's, wrote stories no one would read, painted pictures no one would see. Trying to be anything but the weapon he'd been trained to be.



He needed smokes. An excuse to move, to get out of his head. The corner store was close, and walking might clear the beer fog. Vancouver's night air hit his face as he stepped outside, wet from recent rain. Neon reflected in puddles, painting the streets in colors that reminded him of fight nights. The roar of the crowd, the ring lights, the perfect moment before it all went wrong.



The neighborhood was his stomping grounds now. He'd worked security at every club, knew every alley and side street. Different kind of fighting, but at least it let him keep busy. Most nights he could almost convince himself he was making up for past sins.



The corner store's fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting everything in that artificial glow that made even the simplest things feel bland. Jimmy pushed through the door, focusing on his simple mission. Smokes. In and out. He'd been good lately - four beers was enough, even if the old thirst scratched at his throat.



A crowd had gathered inside by the drinks section, phones out, voices rising. Great. Probably another protest. Downtown Vancouver was full of them these days. He'd seen enough drama for a lifetime - every weekend someone had a cause, a grievance, a reason to stir shit up. He had his own demons to wrestle without taking on the world's problems.



""Belmont regular,"" he called to the clerk, shouldering his way through the growing crowd. A loud thud grabbed his attention. Something was off, but he couldn't place it. Just another thing his mind was trying to process.



The clerk barely glanced up from his own phone, caught in whatever excitement was building. ""One second, sir-- it's Rose Sharp!""



Jimmy rolled his eyes. The name triggered something - Guitar Hero marathons in college, that song they used to play at the gym before fights. ""Who? Like that old singer lady?""



Glass shattered somewhere in the store. The sound cut through his beer haze, snapping his full attention to the present. The crowd's energy had shifted, becoming something uglier. Through gaps between shelves, he caught glimpses of a woman - slim, well-dressed, terror written across her face while hands reached for her from all directions.



Years of fighting had taught Jimmy to read people's eyes. He'd seen that look before - in the mirror during his worst days, in opponents' faces when a fight went too far. Raw fear, the kind that stripped away all humanity.



""Are you okay?"" he spoke with authority, the words came automatically, instincts from a lifetime of regret.



She looked up at him and scoffed - that reflexive defense he knew too well. The kind of arrogance that comes from fear, not strength. He'd worn that same mask plenty of times. But the offence tipped the scales of pride in his head.



""Alright, well see ya later then,"" Jimmy turned away, fight-or-flight instincts screaming at him to reconsider. ""No idea what your issue is, but it ain't mine."" shaking his head he began to walk for the exit.



""Wait..."" Her hand reached out to him. Not grabbing, just desperate. ""Can you get me out of here? Im stuck.""



""I realize that's what you want,"" Jimmy said, the old edge creeping into his voice, ""but I don't know or care who you are. If you're gonna be rude, I'm out."" His time in the ring had taught him to walk away from fights. His time in recovery had taught him to avoid other people's chaos.



""PLEASE!"" 



That single word cut through everything - through his defenses, through his careful plans to stay uninvolved. Real fear. Raw desperation. Jimmy knew that sound. He'd made it himself, back when the drink had him cornered, when he'd lost everything he'd trained for, when his Olympic dreams drowned in bottles and bad decisions.



He turned back, something shifting in his eyes. The same look that used to come before a fight, when the world narrowed to simple choices. Do or Die. Fight or flight.



""As long as you apologize,"" he said, ""and I can have a smoke after."" Trying to keep it light, even as his body tensed for what might come.



Rose nodded frantically. No more attitude now. Just pure terror as the crowd pressed closer, phones recording everything, hands reaching. Jimmy saw past the celebrity to something familiar - someone drowning in a life they never learned how to handle. Like him at nineteen, all talent and no wisdom, no idea how to cope with the pressure.



Jimmy switched gears, ""Next person who touches me,"" he growled, making space with his shoulders, ""next person who gets near ME, fights me!"" The old violence seeped into his voice, familiar as breathing. He pulled Rose under his flannel jacket, feeling her trembling. ""Just let me handle it. I'm gonna get a bit mean, don't worry, I'm a nice guy these days.""



The words felt strange in his mouth. \*Nice guy. These days\*. Like he could erase what he used to be - a force in the ring, the psychopath outside it. The guy who'd let his pride and his demons destroy everything he'd worked for. Now here he was, playing protector instead of destroyer.



In his thoughts jimmy felt the crowd grabbing at his jacket.



""DON'T MAKE ME LET GO. I'LL MASH YOUR FACE IN SOMETHING FIERCE PAL."" His voice carried that edge, the one learned in a thousand fights. Not empty threats - promises backed by years of training, years of violence barely contained. He kept Rose tight against his side, using his body as a shield while the crowd finally began to back off.



Behind them, the clerk had enough sense to lock the doors, buying them precious seconds. Jimmy nodded thanks as they stepped outside. Time to disappear back to his quiet life of controlled drinking and careful isolation.



""Alright, mystery lady, I'm out,"" he said, already lighting a cigarette. His buzz was gone, replaced by familiar adrenaline.



Rose stared at Jimmy's retreating back, genuinely thrown. Nobody walked away from her. Nobody just... dismissed Rose Sharp. For years, her entire world had been people either wanting something from her or trying to control her. But this guy - this rumpled, clearly troubled stranger - didn't seem to want anything at all.



""Wait!"" The word came out more desperate than she'd intended. "" My hotel... It's three blocks away...""



Jimmy sighed, turning back. He took a real look at her face for the first time, and something clicked. The billboards all over downtown, the chaos in the streets all week, the reason his regular routes to work had been disrupted by crowds. She wasn't just some celebrity ‚Äì she was \*that\* celebrity. The one everyone had been talking about.



And she looked fucking terrified.



Not the manufactured fear of someone playing victim, but the real panic of a person who'd forgotten how to exist in the real world. He recognized it because he'd lived it - that moment when you realize you've forgotten how to do normal things, when the simple act of walking down a street becomes impossible because you've lived too long in a different reality.



""Alright, alright, calm down. Which is it?"" The words came out gentler than he intended. Something about her reminded him of himself at his lowest - all that talent, all that potential, trapped in a cage of other people's expectations.



Before she could answer, movement caught his eye. A junkie emerged from the shadows between buildings, that familiar desperate shuffle. Jimmy saw the glint of metal, the reach for her purse. His body moved before his mind could catch up.



His left hook launched with perfect form - muscle memory from thousands of training sessions, hundreds of fights. The punch arced over Rose's head, catching the would-be mugger clean on the jaw. The sound of impact echoed off wet pavement, a solid thunk that brought back memories of better days, when his fists were used for sport.



""YOU IDIOT! JUST FOLLOW ME PRINCESS AMERICA!""



Rose didn't scream. Didn't flinch. She just watched the mugger drop with an almost clinical interest, like someone who'd seen enough violence to categorize it. ""You've done that before,"" she said. Not a question.



""Well..."" Jimmy muttered, ""we've all got a story."" He glanced back at the store, where the crowd was starting to filter out the other exit. ""Look, I can get you back to your fancy hotel without any more drama. Just... try to look less like you, here, take it.""



She pulled his flannel tight around her shoulders. ""I've been trying to look less like me my whole life.""



Something in her voice made Jimmy pause. He recognized that tone - the same one he used when talking about his fighting days, his almost-shot at the Olympics. The voice of someone who'd achieved everything they thought they wanted, only to discover it was the wrong dream entirely.



They walked in silence for half a block, Jimmy scanning the streets with the practiced eye of someone who'd learned the hard way where trouble hides. Four beers in, his senses should've been dulled, but something about watching over someone else sharpened them. Old instincts die hard.



""So,"" Rose said finally, ""you clearly fight. Boxing? MMA?""



""Used to."" Jimmy kept his eyes forward. ""has been.""



""What happened?"" Rose sensed walls building.



Jimmy laughed, harsh and hollow. ""Same thing that happens to most fuck-ups. Got in my own way."" He glanced at her designer sneakers, probably worth more than his monthly rent. ""What about you? Decided being America's sweetheart wasn't exciting enough? Had to add 'getting mugged in Vancouver' to your resume?""



""I just wanted a fucking Pepsi,"" Rose said, the words bursting out like she'd been holding them forever. ""Just one normal thing. One moment where I'm not... this."" She gestured at herself, at the life she couldn't escape. ""Do you know what it's like to have everything you're supposed to want and still feel empty?""



Jimmy's step faltered. Yeah, he knew. He remembered standing in the ring, national champion at seventeen, everyone saying he was destined for greatness, for gold. The pressure of perfection, of other people's dreams. He'd found his escape in bottles. She'd found hers in a late-night store run.



""You really don't know who I am, do you?"" she asked suddenly.



""Guitar Hero,"" he said. ""College parties. That's about it. Been a while since I paid attention to..."" he waved vaguely at the world, ""all this.""



Rose smiled, genuine this time. ""That's... refreshing, actually."" She stepped closer as a group of drunk students passed. ""Everyone knows everything about me. Or thinks they do. My whole life's been public since I was twelve. Sometimes I think my emotions aren't even mine anymore - they belong to the tabloids, the fans, the brand.""



""Yeah, well,"" Jimmy muttered, ""at least you didn't piss it all away."" He thought about his last real fight, how the alcohol had slowed his reflexes, made him sloppy. How he'd lost control outside the ring afterward, the headlines, the shame. ""Some of us earn our obscurity the hard way.""



""Is that what you're doing at the corner store at midnight? Earning your obscurity?""



Jimmy's jaw tightened. ""Just needed smokes."" A lie. He'd needed to escape his apartment, his thoughts, the constant battle between 'just one more' and 'never again.'



""Almost there,"" Jimmy nodded toward the Shangri-La's gleaming tower, keeping his distance as they walked. The streets were quieter now, just the occasional car splashing through puddles.



Rose clutched his flannel closer, slowing her pace. Each step closer to the hotel seemed heavier than the last. Back to the cage, back to being Rose Sharp, back to everything she'd tried to escape for just one soda run.



""Thanks,"" she said finally. ""For not... you know.""



""For not giving a shit who you are?"" Jimmy kept his eyes forward, scanning the shadows more out of habit than necessity. ""Trust me, it's not hard.""



She studied his profile in the neon-tinted darkness. The slight cauliflower ear, the way he carried himself - like someone used to being ready for anything. There was a story there, but he clearly wasn't sharing it.



""Must be nice,"" she said quietly. ""Not giving a shit.""



Jimmy snorted, but didn't answer. His knuckles still tingled from the punch, a familiar ache that brought back memories he'd rather forget. Four beers and a failed smoke run had turned into... whatever this was.



They reached the hotel's side entrance. Through the glass, the luxury lobby gleamed, promising to swallow Rose back into her world of handlers and security and carefully managed appearances.



""This is you,"" Jimmy said, already stepping back. ""Try not to get mobbed buying snacks in the future.""



""Wait,"" Rose started to shrug off his flannel, but he waved her off.



""Keep it. Plenty more where that came from."" He turned to leave, then paused. ""You got your Pepsi after all that?""



Rose looked down at her empty hands, laughing suddenly. ""No. No, I didn't.""



""Figures."" He shrugged, flicking her a two dolar coin, ‚ÄúWe call them Toonies here, should be enough‚Äù. 



Jimmy started walking away, hands in his pockets. No goodbye, no attempt to milk the moment for anything more than it was.



""I don't even know your name,"" Rose called after him.



Jimmy didn't turn around, just raised one hand in a casual wave. Tomorrow, he'd be back to his routine - Riley's, six-pack-beer rules, trying to stay invisible. And she'd be back to being America's sweetheart, sixty thousand fans screaming her name.



But for one night, they'd both been something else. Just two people, walking through Vancouver's rain-slicked streets, recognizing something in each other they weren't ready to name.



Sometimes that's enough.



Back in his apartment, Jimmy stared at the two beers left in the six-pack. For the first time in years, he didn't feel the urge to finish them. He fell asleep on his couch, TV still flickering, dreaming of roaring crowds and bells ringing, while somewhere in the Shangri-La, Rose Sharp sat in her luxury suite, wrapped in a stranger's flannel, finally feeling something real.",1,1729861783.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False
1gbttoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gbttoy/the_backroads_the_masked_lurker/,The Backroads: The Masked Lurker,"Thinking about things you shouldn‚Äôt is an established trait among humans, whether we developed that horrid trait through evolution or it just being a part of us that we always had I don‚Äôt know but I hate it. It sucks and it sucks more when you need just to let go of those certain events however on the road trapped in the Evernight it‚Äôs an impossibility. One does not simply erase horrors from the mind no matter how hard they try but luckily you can distract yourself, you can let your mind wander while driving for hours in the dark. My routine would consist of podcasts blasting music like a sane person, the one thing I‚Äôd recommend is to not fuel that burning desire to dwell on those bad thoughts or memories. Don‚Äôt be stupid and listen to horror videos or true crime podcasts. Don‚Äôt listen to that conspiracy theorist who has his radio station and has the southern voice that draws you in for it will only bring you to contemplate the strange happenings in your neck of the woods, along with the healthy dose distrust with the government staples of the country. Not that his points aren't entirely wrong but most people rather live in bliss. Don‚Äôt listen and think about the creepy shit on the radio, podcast, whatever just leave it as background noise believe me when I say the allure of horror should be kept to fiction as inviting into your life is never a clever idea. And for the love of God and all that is holy don‚Äôt fucking text and drive.

Now you might be wondering ‚ÄòWhy can‚Äôt I think about the creepy shit or bad memories in my life?‚Äô and my answer should be obvious, it‚Äôs creepy shit at night I don‚Äôt care about how brave or edgy you think you are. Out in the dark, that type of vibe can invite things to you, things that look human but well aren‚Äôt. This was made clear to me that my thoughts out at night can both influence and attract certain entities to someone‚Äôs location, some of these beings may be beneficial and can be extremely dangerous. You might ask how some can be beneficial to you. Well from what I‚Äôve heard there are helpful entities that grant people who might come across them with money, treasures, or a sense of peace. Others don‚Äôt do anything remotely close to beneficial but aren‚Äôt exactly out to cause chaos to unfold they just more or less linger in the limbo of the Evernight. The best description I can utilize for them is in the simplest terms, weird. Events that occur be it creepy or riding on the side of weird stupid shit, for instance, there are odd occurrences, like a clown car honking its horn three times, where one of the passengers grants you a sight of a full moon on a clouded night - a peculiar incident, to say the least.

You may think to yourself ‚ÄòOh I‚Äôm fine, it‚Äôs just creepy clowns at night.‚Äô Yeah, many people thought the same thing back in the late 2010s and that ended up with people dead so good luck with that mentality. See in the Evernight you should have at least two rules with you encounter horrifying shit. The first option is to run like hell, or rather drive like a bat out of hell. The second and the riskier is to grab your gat and hold it sideways and explain why this bitch done fucked up. That‚Äôs assuming you have a Glock lying about inside of your car and you can hit while holding sideways. If not plan three seems to work best for some of my fellow contracted coworkers from the various parts of the great United States. Shoot and drive.

I listed the options above as such because when it comes down to it you must either fight or run. And I always say when you choose to run there is no shame in that. You‚Äôre a regular person after all not the protagonist in a novel. When it comes down to decisions you need to value your life and not play stupid games. I also give out these options because you want to learn from others, or you can be like my coworker. He told me about his time driving in the Evernight while I was still under his tutelage, he spoke to me often of his crazy experiences, and although he was extremely inebriated along with smoking way more pot than a den dedicated to growing marijuana. I listened and took away lessons from him. And before you question why he was, I don‚Äôt know why he decided to info dump his hellish stories unto me but there were plenty of bat shit tales that he experienced which most likely led to his current state however being the kind person I am, I leant him my ear. Besides when driving for nearly 12 hours a night having someone ramble about their time working the job you are taking over helps immensely for the first weeks on the job. I‚Äôm more than positive he was a sober great individual, but that person was long gone and the man I had sitting next to me was nothing more than a shell who only functioned from strong booze and somehow managed to drive sober enough to get to his destination. It was enough to keep his employment but of course, it wasn‚Äôt for long.

I made mistakes of dwelling on the terrible memories I made throughout my trips, and I allowed myself to let the supernatural influence my mind while driving and it caused stress like no other. By this point in my life, I learned that the supernatural is very much real and you should at the bare minimum give it the respect it deserves. Don‚Äôt misinterpret what I say next. When you do night drives for as long as I have, no matter the main road, or the backroads you will have an experience that will be seared into your mind or several, and you should treat it with some kind of respect. Not saying you should give a supernatural entity polite speech or anything like that. What I mean is if you encounter a monster, you treat the situation with some actual brain power and deal with it accordingly. For example, if you see a creature that resembles a human stand up screeching in the road within your headlights. You shouldn‚Äôt pull your phone out and film it and hope the cameraman rule applies to you, life is not a movie, and it may not send a saving grace to protect you in the moment that does happen.

Oh yeah, I forgot my old coworker's story, this one isn't necessarily supernatural at least I don't think it is true, but you can consider it an example of what I told you above, you should not put bad thoughts into the world, because the world may respond equally.

I remember he told me a story, on one of his travels he spotted a woman running from the wilderness into the main road and he stopped for her. Her face was that of a gorgeous model and she wore a beautiful white dress. He thought ‚ÄúScore.‚Äù At first and rolled his window down asking where she needed to go. He was told she needed just to get to the next town as fast as possible so that her husband wouldn‚Äôt find her and to at least take her to the hospital.

He was asking what happened to her as she got into his vehicle, and she explained to him that she was beaten by him countless times and she finally mustered up the courage to leave him. She fled with a friend who she trusted and when her husband found her, he beat her and the friend up and shot his friend. She ran away and got a ride from an Uber, but the Uber wouldn‚Äôt take her that far after they were shot at, so she fled down the road and into the wilderness. Feeling horrible for her he sped off telling her she‚Äôd be fine and that she would be taken to the hospital and the police notified.

During this trip she was asking questions and began to get sexual with him, she was being overly flirtatious and despite his better judgment, he let his little brain get the better of him. While they started getting a little busy, he had undone her dress only to discover that she had bullet wounds and stab wounds in her stomach. When he saw this the woman grew angry, she began screeching while grasping at his throat. Screaming he tried getting her off and out of the vehicle only to wake up in the truck alone on the side of the road parked. The only thing he had was the scent of her lingering and the blood still all over his clothes, driving away he shuddered in fear.

That was the story I remembered on one of my trips it was a Friday night. I got my coffee and grabbed my keys to pack up the vehicle they provided me at this old military building that was repurposed for whatever the company uses it for now. I was told to take the supplies they had ready to another contractor in a city a few hours up and come back with some supplies they had in their vehicle. The job was simple, swap the goods and get back down. If anything, else was required they would inform me through text and send me. Simple enough, normal stuff everything that this company takes always goes back to this lab up in a big city and we are sent to collect the items or trade whatever essentially, we are mostly contract couriers. The job was as simple as they come and so I made my way to grab what I needed to form the hospital as directed.

I soon began my long drive into the endless blackness of the Evernight with nothing but the destination in mind. I drove on with music playing and thoughts of ‚Äòwhat horrors may come to play tonight‚Äô. That was the wrong thought because that was the day, I witnessed the first untimely deaths on the road. My mind was racing at the story my coworker told me before I was a free man doing these jobs on my own. It wasn't creepy but I wouldn't know what to do in that situation, not the horny woman in the car. But if someone was riding with me and suddenly attacked me or met someone on the side of the road who needed my help.

As for my story, I vividly remember that night‚Äîit was 2337 I was going about 87 miles an hour on the empty backroads. They were considered to be the new long toll roads however due to the pricing no one ever took them, eventually, they became free however still due to being so far out no one took them. There was a bend in the road with overgrown grass alongside a hill which was the reason I didn't see the hazard lights on the road and they weren't far at all, slamming on the brakes I came to a halt a little way from the vehicle, and my adrenaline spiked at the sudden action I had to take as I contemplated what could have happened had my reaction been a second slower. I would have collided with the vehicle and at best very injured or worse ‚Äì a direct collision with the car. Illuminating the area with my high beams, I discerned a lone white Toyota Camry obstructing the road. Inside, there were figures slumped in their seats, with red stains on the window.

My instincts took over as I unbuckled my seat belt, opened the passenger storage compartment for first aid, and quickly placed it in the center console. Picking up my head and turning for my door I looked out into the night through the window and there briefly illuminated by the hazard lights was a dark figure hidden slightly in the brush. I paused my movement and stared waiting for the lights to flicker on again. As they did, I saw the figure looking at me tilt its head slightly, curious if it was spotted. It was pure luck I noticed; the figure crouched in the grass divider tucked by some of that thick brush. But it was close enough to notice.

My mind raced with thoughts. ‚Äú*What should I do? Should I drive off? Open the door and scream at him to leave? No, I don‚Äôt know what he has. If I don‚Äôt do something now, he‚Äôs going to make the first move.‚Äù*

A few moments went by, and I decided to open the door, I steadied my breathing while cursing myself for doing something that could get me killed. The moment I opened the door and exited I pulled out my gun from its holster and turned my weapon light to expose the figure locking in with my red dot sight. During the few seconds I had opened my door and stepped out the figure had stood up but froze the moment, I turned that beam on and placed a hand up blocking the light in his other hand I took full notice of his still dripping red liquid-stained large knife. I held my position and demanded what he wanted from me.

No verbal response was given however his actions did give a response; he made a slicing motion on his neck as he took a step forward toward me. He must have thought I had a regular flashlight because he continued to step towards me as I yelled for him to stop. I shouted as loud as I could for him to stop moving. Even though he was a decent distance away from where I was a dead sprint from his distance is still dangerous because bullets don‚Äôt stop someone immediately. When he continued to move to me slowly, methodically this was something he was well versed in doing many, many times. I shouted for him to drop the knife and by his fourth step he stopped. I think he finally took notice that what was in my hand wasn't a normal light.

The moment he ceased all movement and that granted me precious seconds of planning. From the looks of it, I could shoot this hooded figure dead and be cleared of any wrongdoing, or I could get back into the vehicle and run away and never think about this again. Another part of me just screamed for me to shoot him and end his life. Whatever bravery the hooded figure showed earlier, he certainly lost it all as the gun was reason enough to not pick this would-be prey tonight and that was good enough for me. He took a few steps back and gave me a small wave as he casually walked away. After he got further into the grass, he gently removed the hood to show a blank mask, one of those party masks you get at a party store. The white mask had noticeable red stains scattered all over the left cheek and to contrast the messy left side was just one long bloody tear coming down from the right eye slit.

After fading into the darkness, I called the police and waited for them to get there, during that time I inspected the body that was in the car, staring up into the car was a handsome young man who was holding his neck, blood splayed across his shirt and fear painted on his face. The multiple stab wounds in his chest indicated the cause of death. In the passenger‚Äôs seat was a beautiful woman who was coughing up blood reaching for the door handle gurgling still and crying in pain, whimpering at the sight of me. I heard her cries as I ran to my car and grabbed a first aid bag. I ran to the side of the car put on the emergency gloves and pulled out gauze and other first aid equipment. I opened the door and assisted her out of the car hearing her cry holding onto me as her blood pooled onto me.

I pulled her to the light of the vehicle and began first aid. She was trying to tell me something however I didn‚Äôt understand her at all. She pointed to her stomach and told me, ‚ÄúIt hurts. Scared.‚Äù She said in gurgled breaths. I tried to do everything I could to prevent the bleeding from continuing however I didn‚Äôt know how long she may have. I cut her shirt with the emergency scissors and looked at her body, the source of her bleeding was the three stab wounds to her stomach, I grabbed some of the clotting gauze and began putting it onto the knife wounds and wrapping them around her stomach as her cries of pain echoed into the night. Minutes felt like hours, and I held her there in the night as she kept crying out for help. She was holding onto my blood stand jacket as I kept her other hand on her wound putting pressure on it.

Occasionally the sound of a crunch echoed in the grassy patches to which my response was a sweep with my pistol with the light on and ready to shoot. My fear grew not only for me but the woman I now held in my arms, I was scared, not just for her as horrible as it sounds. I didn‚Äôt want to get stabbed by the masked man because that would mean certain death for both of us. My attention was stretched thin from both the sounds of the grass on the other side of the road and the young girl's moans of pain. The bleeding wouldn't stop so I had to help her the best way I knew how. Pulling more of the first aid out applying more of the gauze on her wound and pushing her into the recovery position.

I did my best to tell her to keep talking, fight through the pain, and keep telling me random facts about anything. My goal was to keep her away from death for as long as I could. The growing fear that I would be the last person on this planet to see her before she died was becoming a reality the longer I waited for the police.

All the while I kept on the lookout for the police. Finally, after what felt like a lifetime both law enforcement came alongside an ambulance, the relief of seeing those red and blue lights was unlike any other. I put my gun quickly away as I exclaimed to the woman she would be okay. I saw one of the medical personnel get out of the vehicle one quickly walk over to her, while I moved aside for them I didn't take note of who it was but one of the people grabbed me and promptly shoved me into the Camry.

It then hit me as the cold steel of the handcuffs placed on me, my mind registered it was a police officer who was now reading me my rights. As he was shouting at me, I could only stare into the shocked expression of the young man who lifelessly sat in the car in front of me. I could only recall being shoved into the car twice over and the cop screaming at me demanding 'What happened to him!? Tell me damn it.'

Finally, after what felt like what would have been another bashing, the man‚Äôs motion abruptly stopped, and a female voice asked me to explain myself as I felt the strong grip of the man loosen and drop away from my arms.

Turning my head to her I looked at the man who cuffed and slammed my head into the car, the startling realization that he looked remarkably like the young boy in the car. With tears rolling down his cheek I understood his frustration. The female officer took me and guided me to her car where we spoke of my encounter. I told her what had happened mentioning how I just saw a hooded figure walk away from me waving goodbye. She shook her head in disbelief however even if my brief explanation didn‚Äôt give them much to work it did seem to clear me of any involvement other than being the unlucky individual who stumbled upon the scene.

She said to me, ‚ÄúYou know she might make it, and it's thanks to you. You‚Äôre a hero.‚Äù I looked at her almost disgusted by the word, I was not a hero that is for sure. A hero would have done more, I did not even shoot the man responsible for it.

She wrote down my information and said she would contact me if anything came up for whatever reason they would need me. But as far as they were concerned and needed. I was free to go after an hour. I thanked them and her turning I made my way to my vehicle. Driving off I looked back at the eerie sight of the red and blue flashing lights of the EMS swallowing the hazard lights which were losing their power and fading into small faint orange lights by now.

I felt regret hit me a sort of heaviness in my chest, the thing I noticed when I was there was how in the car I noticed their phones, purses, and even his backpack inside the car were not messed with just those two individuals who were murdered. They were just prey to a monster in human skin within the Evernight, it was not a robbery gone wrong, it was just murder for the sake of murder. That experience gave me a rush I didn‚Äôt want to feel, the cold feeling of adrenaline flowing through my body as I was thrust into a fight or flight response coincided with the painful guilt. The guilt of not pulling the trigger and ending his life. That unhealthy guilt of knowing I let a monster get away into the darkness of the Evernight.",1,1729861673.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
1gbtroy,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1gbtroy/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?

1gbtdir,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhiteWilliamSociety/comments/1gbtdir/chernobyl_the_smoking_gun_for_sasquatch_aliens/,"Chernobyl: The Smoking Gun for Sasquatch, Aliens, and Lizard People","Hey there, fellow truth-seekers,

It's your favorite conspiracy theorist, White William, and boy do I have some wild ideas for you today! Buckle up, because we‚Äôre about to venture down the rabbit hole of secrets, cover-ups, and the undeniable proof that SASQUATCH EXISTS, ALIENS ARE REAL, and the ENTIRE GOVERNMENT is INFESTED WITH LIZARD PEOPLE. Yep, I said it.

Let's start with the big one: Chernobyl. In 1986, when that nuclear reactor went haywire, it opened a portal‚Äînot just to radiation, but to a whole new realm of reality. Think about it! The disaster resulted in massive radiation leaks, creating a permanent exclusion zone around the reactor. And what's been spotted in that creepy, now-abandoned area? Sightings of monstrous figures resembling our beloved Sasquatch!

Could it be possible that radiation is altering the genetic makeup of local wildlife? Sasquatch, a creature of myth, could well be a mutant survivor, adapting to the toxic landscape left by mankind‚Äôs nuclear folly. If Sasquatch can thrive in such conditions, imagine what other creatures‚Äîperhaps even extraterrestrial beings‚Äîmight be lurking unseen. That leads us to our next point: ALIENS!

Chernobyl wasn‚Äôt just a nuclear meltdown; it was an alien signal. The disaster attracted the interest of beings from beyond our world, possibly spurred on by the energy emitted from that reactor's catastrophic explosion. There have been reports of mysterious lights and UFO sightings in the area. What if these aliens are using the fallout zone as a staging ground to observe humanity? They‚Äôre piecing together the puzzle of our chaotic world, and they‚Äôre not happy about it!

Now, let‚Äôs connect the dots further. The very fact that the government has been quiet about these incidents speaks volumes. We've all heard the whispers: the influential folks, the puppet masters pulling the strings, are not human. They‚Äôre LIZARD PEOPLE! Cold-blooded creatures masquerading as politicians and bureaucrats, and they‚Äôve infiltrated every level of power. You think they‚Äôd let word get out that Sasquatch exists? Or that aliens are scouting our planet? No way! They‚Äôre keeping us distracted with TV shows, sports, and, I kid you not, REALITY TELEVISION!

So here‚Äôs where it all comes together, my fellow truth-hunters: Chernobyl might just be the very smoking gun. Why has there been no comprehensive investigation into the bizarre occurrences in the exclusion zone? Why haven‚Äôt we demanded to see the footage of Sasquatch prancing through the woods or UFOs buzzing through the irradiated skies? Because the Lizard People in power want to keep that knowledge under wraps. They thrive on disinformation, steering us away from the truths that could shake the foundations of civilization!

Please, take a moment to consider the facts. We have Sasquatch sightings post-Chernobyl, strange lights in the sky, and a government that operates behind a veil of secrecy. It‚Äôs time to wake up and smell the conspiracy coffee! The evidence is there; we just need to stop ignoring the obvious and connect these dots.

Remember: If you‚Äôre not paranoid, you‚Äôre not paying attention. So keep your tinfoil hats on tight, and let‚Äôs uncover the truth together!

The first was in Phoenix Park. We were parked in a regular spot with our small car. Then this massive truck pulled into the space beside us, clearly too big to fit properly. My partner had gone to get coffees with the keys, so I was sitting in the car, still recovering from a recent illness‚Äîthis was my first outing after being laid up.

The driver got out and actually asked me to move our car over so his wife and kids could get out! I explained that my partner would be back shortly, and moving wasn‚Äôt really an option as the area (near the cricket pitches) was full. Squeezing over would‚Äôve brought us far too close to the car on our other side. He was incredibly rude and eventually drove off.

The second run-in was today in the car park under Lidl. It was busy with very few spaces. Another one of these massive trucks was idling, blocking the lane while waiting for a spot. The car in front of me couldn‚Äôt get past because there wasn‚Äôt enough room, so the beeping began. The truck only budged after it had really ramped up.

These vehicles just aren‚Äôt suited to our narrow roads and tight parking spots here. While I get that some people genuinely need larger vehicles for work, I worry we‚Äôre going to see more of these oversized trucks clogging up Irish roads and car parks in the years to come.

1gbtae7,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1gbtae7/dream_house/,Dream House,"I have always loved this house. From the moment I first saw it, sitting there at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac, I knew it was my dream home. It had everything‚Äîa wraparound porch with a swing, a sprawling lawn with a giant oak tree in the back, and just enough space to feel cozy but not cramped. Pale blue siding, white trim, and flowers that Laura had planted along the walkway. It was perfect.

It was the kind of place where we were supposed to build our lives together.

We moved in when Sarah was born, and it felt like the start of everything. Me, Laura, Sarah, and then Michael came along a few years later. Our family grew, and so did our happiness. Every corner of this house was filled with memories‚ÄîSarah‚Äôs first steps in the living room, Michael‚Äôs messy paintings on the fridge, Laura laughing in the kitchen as she burned another batch of cookies.

It felt like a picture-perfect life. I told myself every day how lucky I was. A beautiful wife, two kids, a nice job‚Äîeverything a man could want.

But lately‚Ä¶ something‚Äôs been off.

It‚Äôs hard to put into words, really. Small things at first. Laura seemed distant, like she wasn‚Äôt really there. I‚Äôd try to talk to her about her day, but she‚Äôd shrug, barely looking up from her phone. The warmth that used to be in her voice, her laugh, it was gone. She still did all the usual things‚Äîmade dinner, drove the kids to school‚Äîbut something had shifted.

I told myself it was stress. We‚Äôd been married for years, and people change. Maybe she was tired. Maybe I was reading too much into it. But the feeling kept creeping in, like a splinter under the skin.

Sarah, my sweet little girl, was turning thirteen. She used to be so bubbly, always telling me about her day, excited about school. Now, when I asked how things were going, she just shrugged or mumbled something under her breath, then stormed off to her room. She started locking herself away for hours, barely coming out for dinner. The way she looked at me‚Ä¶ there was something new in her eyes. Something cold.

Michael, too. He was always a quiet kid, but he seemed to be retreating into himself more and more. He‚Äôd sit at the breakfast table, staring at his cereal, not even looking up when I spoke. I‚Äôd ask him if he wanted to toss a ball around after school, and he‚Äôd just shake his head, muttering a vague excuse before disappearing into his room.

The mornings started feeling wrong. We‚Äôd all be sitting around the table, but there was no conversation, no life. Just silence. Laura would sip her coffee, staring out the window, lost in thought. Sarah would scroll through her phone, occasionally rolling her eyes at something, but never looking at me. Michael‚Ä¶ well, he was just there, silent, like a shadow.

I‚Äôd sit there, sipping my own coffee, staring at the three of them, and I‚Äôd feel this growing distance. Like there was an invisible barrier between us, something I couldn‚Äôt quite name but could feel.

It wasn‚Äôt always like this, was it?

Then came the night when I came home late. I had been stuck at work, tied up in some project, and by the time I pulled into the driveway, it was already dark. The house was eerily silent when I stepped through the door.

‚ÄúLaura?‚Äù I called out, my voice echoing through the hallway.

No answer.

I flicked on the lights, moving from room to room. The living room was empty. The kitchen‚Äîempty. I started up the stairs, my stomach knotting with unease.

‚ÄúSarah? Michael?‚Äù

Nothing.

I pushed open Sarah‚Äôs bedroom door. Her bed was made, her room neat and tidy, but there was no sign of her. Michael‚Äôs room was the same‚Äîeverything in place, but no Michael.

I made my way to the master bedroom, expecting to find Laura asleep, but when I stepped inside, the bed was untouched. It looked like it hadn‚Äôt been slept in at all.

A strange feeling washed over me‚Äîsomething cold, heavy. I stood there in the silence, staring at the empty bed, my heart racing.

Where the hell was everyone?

I went back downstairs, pacing the living room, staring at the family photos on the walls. Pictures of us at the beach last summer, Laura holding Sarah when she was a baby, me smiling beside them. But as I looked closer, something seemed off about the photos.

In one of them, Laura‚Äôs face seemed blurred, her features smudged. Sarah and Michael‚Äôs faces were there, but something about them was‚Ä¶ wrong. Their expressions seemed different, like they weren‚Äôt smiling anymore. I blinked and looked again, and the photo was normal, everything in its place. But the unease remained.

I tried to shake it off, tried to convince myself that I was overreacting. Families go through rough patches, right? Maybe I was just imagining things.

But then, the next morning, it got worse.

I woke up to the smell of burnt toast and walked downstairs to find Laura at the stove, but she didn‚Äôt greet me. She didn‚Äôt even turn around when I entered the kitchen.

‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù I said, trying to sound casual.

She didn‚Äôt respond.

I sat down at the table, watching as she stood there, motionless, staring at the pan like she didn‚Äôt know what to do with it.

‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù I asked, my voice quieter now.

Still, she didn‚Äôt answer.

The kids came downstairs eventually, Sarah storming past me with barely a glance, Michael trailing behind her like a ghost. They sat at the table in silence, both of them picking at their food, not looking at me, not looking at each other.

I could feel the distance between us growing, like a chasm opening up in the middle of the kitchen, pulling us apart. The house felt colder, emptier, as if the life had drained out of it.

I tried to talk to Laura about it that evening, after the kids had gone to bed.

‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs wrong, Laura,‚Äù I said, standing in the doorway of our bedroom, watching her as she sat on the bed, her back to me. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, we‚Äôre not us anymore. You don‚Äôt talk to me, the kids barely acknowledge me‚Äîwhat‚Äôs happening?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt respond at first. She just sat there, her shoulders tense, her hands clenched in her lap.

Finally, she turned to face me, and when she did, her eyes were cold‚Äîcolder than I‚Äôd ever seen them.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre imagining things,‚Äù she said, her voice flat. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always imagining things.‚Äù

Her words cut deeper than I expected. I opened my mouth to argue, to tell her that I wasn‚Äôt imagining anything, but something about the way she looked at me stopped me cold. There was a darkness in her eyes, something I couldn‚Äôt quite place, something I‚Äôd never seen before.

I slept on the couch that night.

After that, everything started to unravel.

The house no longer felt like a home. The walls seemed to be closing in on me, the air heavy with something I couldn‚Äôt name. The pictures on the walls looked different every time I walked past them‚Äîsometimes the faces were clear, sometimes they were distorted, unrecognizable.

I started hearing things, too. Late at night, when I was lying in bed, I‚Äôd hear whispers coming from the walls, soft, unintelligible, like someone was talking just out of reach. But whenever I strained to listen, the voices would stop.

The kids became more distant by the day. Sarah would lock herself in her room for hours, and when I tried to talk to her, she‚Äôd scream at me to leave her alone. Michael‚Ä¶ he barely even existed anymore. He‚Äôd sit in the corner of the living room, staring at nothing, his face pale and blank.

And Laura‚Ä¶ Laura was gone, even though she was still there. She moved through the house like a ghost, her eyes hollow, her words sharp and cutting whenever she bothered to speak at all. I‚Äôd catch her watching me sometimes, her gaze cold and full of something I couldn‚Äôt understand‚Äîresentment, maybe. Hatred.

I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I needed answers.

Then came that night.

I woke up to the sound of screaming‚Äîhigh-pitched, frantic, coming from Sarah‚Äôs room. I bolted upright in bed, my heart pounding, and raced down the hallway.

I burst through the door, my eyes wild, and saw Sarah standing in the middle of the room, her hands clawing at her own face, screaming like she was being torn apart from the inside.

‚ÄúSarah!‚Äù I shouted, rushing toward her. ‚ÄúSarah, what‚Äôs happening?!‚Äù

But she didn‚Äôt answer. She just kept screaming, her eyes wide and terrified, her fingers digging into her skin until it bled.

‚ÄúLaura!‚Äù I yelled, looking toward the door, but when I saw her standing there, my blood ran cold. She was watching me with that same blank, cold expression, like none of this mattered. Like I didn‚Äôt matter.

‚ÄúDo something!‚Äù I screamed, my voice breaking.

But Laura just smiled‚Äîa small, cruel smile‚Äîand said nothing.

And then, it hit me. The realization came crashing down on me, so sudden and so intense that I nearly fell to my knees.

They hated me.

My family‚Äîmy wife, my children‚Äîthey hated me. The distance, the coldness, the silence‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt because they were tired or stressed or going through some phase. It was because they couldn‚Äôt stand me. My heart raced as the thought twisted itself deeper and deeper into my mind. The memories of their cold stares, their curt replies, the way Laura had started avoiding me altogether‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt paranoia. It was real. They wanted me out of their lives.

I could feel my chest tightening, my breath coming in shallow gasps. Sarah‚Äôs screams continued, but they seemed distant now, muffled, like they were coming from another room. All I could focus on was the hatred. The venom that seemed to ooze from every corner of this house. It was suffocating.

I backed out of Sarah‚Äôs room, stumbling down the hallway, my hands shaking. Laura was following me. I could feel her eyes on my back, that icy smile still curling her lips. I ran down the stairs, nearly tripping in my haste, my mind racing with panic.

I ended up in the kitchen, my heart pounding in my chest. The lights above flickered, casting strange shadows on the walls. The house felt like it was closing in on me, like the walls were breathing, watching, waiting for something. I grabbed the counter to steady myself, my fingers slipping on the smooth surface, sweat and fear making everything feel unreal, slippery.

That‚Äôs when I saw it‚Äîthe knife block on the counter.

The thought came so suddenly, so violently, that it made my head spin. The idea of it, the need for it, was overwhelming. I could end it. I could end all of it. The hate, the distance, the emptiness. I could take control. I could make them pay for everything they‚Äôd put me through. Laura, with her cold eyes and her cruel smile. Sarah and Michael, with their indifference, their silence.

I reached out, my hand trembling, and pulled one of the knives free. The weight of it was reassuring, solid in my hand. I gripped it tighter, feeling the cold steel against my skin. My breath came in shallow gasps as I turned, the kitchen spinning around me.

And there they were.

Laura stood in the doorway, watching me, her face expressionless. Behind her, Sarah and Michael stood side by side, their eyes blank, staring at me with that same cold detachment. None of them moved. None of them said a word.

I took a step toward them, the knife held out in front of me. My heart was pounding so loud it felt like it would burst from my chest.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve had enough,‚Äù I said, my voice shaking. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done. I can‚Äôt do this anymore.‚Äù

No response. Just those cold, empty eyes staring back at me. The hate was palpable, suffocating. I could feel it pressing down on me from all sides, thickening the air, making it hard to breathe.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to end this,‚Äù I whispered, my voice barely audible. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to end all of it.‚Äù

And then, everything exploded.

I lunged forward, the knife flashing in the dim light. Laura didn‚Äôt scream. She didn‚Äôt fight. She just stood there, watching me with those dead eyes as the blade plunged into her chest. I felt the resistance as it sank in, felt the warmth of her blood spilling over my hands. She crumpled to the floor, her body limp and lifeless.

But I wasn‚Äôt done.

Sarah and Michael‚Ä¶ they stood there, still as statues, their faces unreadable. I turned to them, my vision blurring with rage and pain and confusion. I couldn‚Äôt even see their faces clearly anymore‚Äîjust shadows, silhouettes in the dark. I swung the knife, felt it connect, heard the dull thud of bodies hitting the floor.

And then there was silence.

I don‚Äôt know how long I stood there, staring down at their bodies, the blood pooling around them, staining the floor. My hands were shaking, the knife slipping from my grasp and clattering to the ground. The house was so quiet now. Too quiet.

But something felt wrong.

The kitchen‚Ä¶ the walls‚Ä¶ the whole place. It was all wrong.

The house wasn‚Äôt my dream house anymore. The paint was peeling, the floorboards creaked under my weight, and the walls were covered in dust. I blinked, trying to clear my vision, but it only got worse. The pictures on the walls‚Äîthey were gone. The frames were still there, hanging crooked on the walls, but the photos inside were missing. No. Not missing. Changed.

Where once there were photos of us as a family‚Äîme, Laura, Sarah, and Michael‚Äîthere were only pictures of me. Alone. In every photo, I was standing by myself. No Laura. No kids. Just me, staring back at myself from every frame.

My stomach twisted into knots, a cold sweat breaking out over my skin. I turned slowly, looking around the room. The house felt‚Ä¶ dead. There was no sign of life here. The dishes in the sink were covered in grime, the curtains hung limp and faded, and the air smelled musty, like it hadn‚Äôt been lived in for years.

I staggered backward, nearly slipping in the blood. My heart pounded in my ears, my head spinning. None of this made sense. None of this was right.

I rushed to the front door, throwing it open, desperate for air. But when I stepped outside, the world beyond the porch was dark, featureless, like a void. The street, the neighbors‚Äô houses‚Äîthey were gone. There was nothing. Just blackness. An endless, suffocating blackness stretching out in every direction.

I stumbled back inside, slamming the door shut, my hands shaking uncontrollably. I turned and looked at the house again, my mind racing, trying to make sense of what I was seeing.

And that‚Äôs when I saw them‚Äîthe bodies.

Not Laura‚Äôs. Not Sarah‚Äôs or Michael‚Äôs.

They were mine. All of them. In the kitchen, in the hallway, in the living room. Different versions of me, lying on the floor, bloodied and broken, their eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. I couldn‚Äôt breathe. My chest felt tight, my vision blurry.

And then, the truth hit me.

They had never been here. Laura, Sarah, Michael‚Äînone of them were real. I had been alone this whole time. I‚Äôd always been alone. This house, this life, it was all in my head.

I collapsed to my knees, the weight of the realization crushing me. The walls around me seemed to breathe, to pulse with the madness that had consumed me for so long. I could feel it wrapping around me, choking the last bit of sanity from my mind.

I looked down at the knife, still slick with blood, lying at my feet. My own blood.

In the end, there was only one way out.

The house is quiet now.

1gbtaae,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/1gbtaae/is_this_normal_for_an_elderly_person_to_do/,Is this normal for an elderly person to do?,"My mom (Who is 62) refuses to go to bed at night and will stay awake all night and then sleep during the day. She will often wake me up 5-20 times during the night. She is disabled from issues with her legs and back and while she can walk and still do a lot, most of the time she'll usually ask me to do something for her instead.

I have told her that she needs to work on fixing her sleep schedule but she says it's me that's the problem for not adjusting.

The behavior that I want to talk about though is this, to use an example yesterday my mom woke me up at 3am asking for coffee despite the fact that she had two drinks available, I had told her that I was going to sleep, as she had two drinks that were given to her before bed, water and diet soda.

She had said ""Well, if you don't make and give me my coffee, I'm going to go into the kitchen and fall over and call the fire department or police and say that you pushed me or that I fell and it was due to your negligence.""

Another example was she was reading the news on her phone in the early early morning, and she couldn't read the text as it was too small, so she called me to read it for her. I told her to simply not read that text and please head to sleep. However she said ""If you don't read this for me, I'm gonna tell (Insert the name of her caregivers caregiving company) that you abandoned me at night and ignored me, I'll do my best to get you sent to jail, stupid bitch.""

The last example was there are cats that come around our house and one of them had kittens, in the middle of the night she asked if I would get up and search around the porch and yard at night for a kitten and bring it in because she thinks kittens are cute. I said no and that it was far too late.

Her response was ""Oh so you don't care? You just want little kittens to die because you're a heartless monster? Fine, but if they die out there it's all your fault."" This behavior and her rate of waking me up at night has increased, is any of this normal for an elderly person?",8,1729860018.0,CaregiverSupport,8,1.0,False

I am very excited for this as I know it‚Äôs an important event for them. Right after their degrees there‚Äôs going to be my old best friend Tessa(F22)‚Äôs degree. 

Tessa and I have had a very complicated friendship in the past. We were literally besties 2 years ago but a lot of things happened between huge fights and break points that led us not to be best friends anymore. Around 1 year ago is when we would still get coffees every once in a while as I was hoping to get close again, she would agree to hangout but would behave in a very passive aggressive and toxic way towards me, like judging everything I was telling her, making comments about my boyfriend, etc. I thought I ‚Äúdeserved‚Äù this because as we fought a lot before I thought I had to ‚Äúgain her trust again‚Äù which I now realize was total bullshit.

I went through a very difficult period of time this winter and she wasn‚Äôt there for me at all. I didn‚Äôt expect her to be, but she started being more toxic as she was getting nicer in our ‚Äúsolo‚Äù coffees but literally bully me when we were with our friends. For example, one day we were drinking a coffee with one of our boy friends who also happens to be my ex (we were together many years ago and now we are just super chill friends) and her behavior was just all over the place. She basically wouldn‚Äôt let me speak at all, she would keep touching his arms and hands and calling him ‚Äúlove‚Äù, acting like they‚Äôre super close friends. I started feeling stupid and very lonely as they were literally the only two having a conversation.

Clearly things weren‚Äôt working out between us and I just accepted it, as I said I was already going through a difficult time and didn‚Äôt want to add anything to make me feel worse. I stopped asking her for coffees but I did invite her to my degree in June though, because I was still hoping to be at least in good terms, to which she couldn‚Äôt come and that‚Äôs ok.

So, now the situation is this: she had her degree last month and she didn‚Äôt invite me. It‚Äôs ok, as I said I don‚Äôt consider us friends. But Paul, who is friends with both of us, was invited and he told me that she spoke absolute crap about me at her party after her ceremony (he defended me). He also told me that last week he casually mentioned her that we are hanging out often in these days and Tessa reacted very surprised, telling him like ‚ÄúReally?! You‚Äôre seeing OP? She didn‚Äôt text me that she was in town (Info: I study abroad), we don‚Äôt see each other at all‚Ä¶‚Äù Paul asked her why she acted so surprised considered how crappy she spoke about me at her ceremony and she was silent.

Now she replied to my insta story asking me if I‚Äôm in town. 

Honestly I don‚Äôt want to see her because she just brings toxic energy in my life. But next week there are my friends‚Äô Paul and Mark degree ceremonies right before hers, so they were thinking to celebrate all together with a big lunch. I thought about it and I don‚Äôt want to go to this lunch if she‚Äôs going to be present, but I also feel like it‚Äôs a special moment for my friends Paul and Mark and I would like to be there for them. So, WIBTA if I didn‚Äôt go to the lunch-party?

1gbt9uz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1gbt9uz/how_i_think_about_forming_my_habits_spiritual/,How I think about forming my habits (spiritual perspective),"New habits are merely the repetition of thought patterns and actions.

These determine the quality of our daily lives and shape our personalities. These habits decide whether we grow or stagnate, so we must consciously shape them to ensure our growth.

You are capable of acting, and you are doing something right now. You act all day, 24/7. You are always in some state. You always think about something; you are always in some mental or emotional state.

These thought patterns and actions can repeat over days, weeks, and years. Those that persist over many days become habits. You might even do them at the same time each day.

Perhaps you drink a coffee every morning, take a walk, check social media, or read the news. Every evening you take a bath and brush your teeth. When your partner makes you angry, you yell at them. When you go out, you always style your hair in a particular way. You eat your food quickly.

When people see you, you think you must look awkward. When you look at the calendar and see it's Monday, you get a stomachache and think your life is like that of a slave. When you see a delicious dessert or alcohol, you already feel like you're consuming it and feeling good. When someone criticizes you, you immediately retort with something to mock them or find logical flaws‚Äîor you start criticizing yourself, agreeing that you're not good enough.

There are countless habits that make up your life.

So when we talk about a new habit, we are actually talking about transforming an existing habit into a new one. There is no space for a new one, as there is always some habit that is active. Thus, it is not about adding something new but about transformation and change.

Your goal is to transform. You must clearly think thoughts and repeatedly take actions that build you up.

Actions that make your life better, easier, and more beautiful. They color in the painful desires and limitations of the human body and the gray, superficial aspects of society, turning them into a playful dream while you are free physically, mentally, and financially.

So you actually want heaven. I just described it.

Heavenly joy is when you are sincerely grateful even when you appear to be unfortunate. When you see beauty in filth. Order in chaos. Love in hatred. Depth beneath the surface. Meaning in the message.

And infinity within yourself.

After all, you do not know where you came from or where you are going. You don't even know exactly what you thought before or what you will think in the future‚Äîor even what you think right now.

Something creates this for you, and you experience it. After all, you are not doing it; you do nothing. Something continues constantly, again and again, never stopping, never dying.

How long will it go on? We do not know its past or future. We may assume it is temporary and began when we were born and ends when we die. But something birthed us, and something takes us to death.

So we are not alone; there is something else beyond us that created us and carries us forward. This something must be beyond life and death, beginning and end, as it transcends them.

We experience what this something does. We are the observers. If we observe, then it does not happen to us but only to that which we observe.

Thus, we are not limited by what we observe. We are beyond it. We only see its limitations‚Äîthe limitations of the body and mind. We experience what these are like. But they are not us.

We are drawn to what is not human, what is beyond us. We do not like illness or decay. We fear aging, fear death, fear the unknown future. We are not used to limitation. It is new to us, foreign, frightening.

For it is temporary, and we are not. We are frightened because we believe we are not merely the observers of the temporary. We experience it as if it were the ultimate truth‚Äîthat we are limited, weak, powerless, temporary.

The goal is to bring what is beyond‚Äîwhat is eternal and infinite‚Äîinside.

To see infinity in earthly decay. Rebirth in death, healing in pain, creation in destruction, warmth in cold, satisfaction in desire, learning in suffering, and lessons in misfortune.

The goal is heaven. Creating heaven with your current tools, in your current state, in your current situation. To reach heaven by experiencing here what you would experience elsewhere. To experience boundlessness, strength, beauty, ease, and playfulness here.

How each person reaches this depends on them. But we all long for it. For heavenly states. That is why we desire peace, love the concept of infinite energy, speed, strength, boundlessness, and beauty. Because they are all characteristics of heaven. Everything that is beautiful and that our soul is drawn to is there.

The difficulty is that human existence often seems like the opposite of heaven.

False, superficial desires and pleasures, and the dissatisfaction, craving, and depression that follow them. The trap of society is that it promises heavenly pleasures, but what it provides is an earthly pleasure.

Earthly pleasure is fleeting and superficial. It is not eternal. It is not infinite. It fades, runs out, ends. And afterward, you crave it again, even more. You can hardly think of anything else‚Äîyou want it again.

It takes control over your body and your thoughts. You become addicted to earthly, superficial pleasures. And they give you nothing in the long term. Nothing remains.

They are made of sand, blown away by the wind. They decompose, decay.

The eternal, heavenly pleasure, however, is yours and is with you everywhere. It is something within you. It does not fade because it does not belong to your body or your environment.

It belongs to your understanding. To your reason. So even if your body hurts, even if you have no money, even if you are alone... You are still okay, because you have knowledge that is infinite and not transient.

The body, money, and human relationships are transient. So if you base your happiness on them, your happiness will be fragile. It can break at any moment, turning into disappointment, pain, suffering, and lack.

The goal is for your thought patterns to reflect heavenly pleasures. To see strength in your weakness, lessons in your pain, wealth in your poverty, blessings in accidents.

If you recognize this, then you will live in heaven, as good things will always happen to you. Nothing can happen to you that does not build, heal, sustain, energize, or delight you.

Heaven exists in your mind. You can see it; it is not hidden from you, not closed off. It is accessible, infinite, and all yours.

But it depends on you what you accept from it.

Many are addicted to human, earthly, superficial pleasures. It is hard to let go of superficial pleasures and beliefs because they seem to bring happiness and security.

Those who cannot see or create security for themselves will run away.

They flee, afraid, because they are alone, do not know what to do, panic. That is why they seek refuge‚Äîwhich society gladly provides in the form of superficial poison.

With superficial pleasure, everything seems fine in life. No shame, no pain, no limitations, no weakness.

Of course, this is not true. The reality in which you see these things still exists. It just passed. You just put it aside. Instead, you see a false security. And you get used to always running away and reaching for superficial pleasure. This became your habit. That is why you never felt the need to learn to create security, peace, and beauty for yourself. It was never necessary, and you never learned how.

That is why you became addicted to earthly, superficial pleasures. Cigarettes, drama, TikTok, self-help books, sugar, spicy food, changing intimate partners, shopping, complaining, videogames and so on.

These do not give you peace, tranquility, joy, or gratitude. They fade, end, and you are back where you started. You do not grow from them. Nothing good happens to you. In fact, your habit of turning to them grows stronger, and you become less and less able to energize yourself. You want life less and less because it becomes harder and harder to be happy on your own.

That is why you need heavenly, infinite pleasures, which also exist on earth‚Äîyou just need to see them and accept them.

To do this, you must recognize what is eternal and what is temporary. Otherwise, you will confuse them.

You need to rewrite your perception, worldview, and your subconscious mind. So it will help you see the positive aspects in everything that might otherwise drain your energy.

This way, the knowledge will not only be yours but the practice as well. You will not only recognize the apple of knowledge but also eat it and taste its flavor.

Later, I will write about what these patterns are if you are interested.

In 1921, Hong Wing & Sons was opened by Chinese-Trinidadian Chang Hong Wing, and quickly became the first large-scale coffee manufacturers in Trinidad and Tobago, offering both roasted ground coffee and whole bean coffee. 

Their first location was established on Broadway Street in Port of Spain, but due to the growing popularity of their products within the first two decades, the company needed to expand to larger premises. They relocated to their current address of #57 Prince Street, where manufacturing has taken place for over 70 years. 

Hong Wing and Sons was one of the earliest companies in Port of Spain to use machinery run by electricity, and this allowed them to provide large quantities of high-grade drinking coffee. At that time, the company also operated as Wholesale and Retail Grocers, where they sold various grocery items. 

Over the years, Hong Wing and Sons passed on to Mr. Henry Chang Wah Yow, the son of Chang Hong Wing. Since then, the company has been run by four generations of the Hong Wing family.

1gbt8d5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrakashamParakkatte/comments/1gbt8d5/chapter_9_the_weight_of_shadows/,Chapter 9: The Weight of Shadows,"The military base sprawled across the mountainside, a labyrinth of steel and concrete surrounded by dense woodlands. Tall, fortified walls and automated turrets ensured that nothing went unnoticed, though the threats outside had grown rare and elusive. The base itself was a city of soldiers, engineers, and researchers, buzzing with purpose beneath the watchful eye of the World Council. They were the keepers of order in a fractured world, deciding which missions were essential to the survival of humanity and which ones could be sacrificed for the greater good.

Inside the cafeteria, the scent of stale coffee and reheated meals filled the air. It was a place where soldiers sought respite, however brief, between missions. Renno and Sreya sat at a corner table, away from the clusters of fatigued troops. Sreya studied Renno's face carefully before speaking.

‚ÄúThe council won‚Äôt approve the expedition to the Asamai Mountains,‚Äù Sreya began. Her tone was calm, but her words carried the weight of frustration. ‚ÄúThey think it‚Äôs a waste of resources, especially with the way you‚Äôve been lately.‚Äù

Renno's gaze was distant, his fingers absentmindedly tracing the rim of his coffee cup. ‚ÄúLately,‚Äù he echoed, a bitter smile tugging at his lips. ‚ÄúYou mean ever since I lost control of this... new gift?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault,‚Äù Sreya insisted, though the argument felt hollow even to her. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still adjusting. But I can‚Äôt deny that your visions have been... unpredictable. You‚Äôre not ready for combat.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen why even try to convince them?‚Äù Renno‚Äôs voice was low, almost resigned.

‚ÄúBecause Tom could still be alive. And if there‚Äôs even a small chance, then it‚Äôs worth taking,‚Äù Sreya replied, her voice firm. She leaned forward, as if willing her conviction into him. ‚ÄúThe last energy readings from his suit and Thadaka‚Äôs signature were detected in that region. I‚Äôm not asking you to fight, Renno. I just need you to help me find some answers.‚Äù

Renno‚Äôs eyes met hers, a storm of uncertainty brewing within them. ‚ÄúAnd what if the council says no?‚Äù

‚ÄúThen we go anyway,‚Äù Sreya said, a note of defiance in her voice. ‚ÄúWe owe it to Tom.‚Äù

She hesitated before continuing, her voice softening as she spoke. ‚ÄúRenno, everything is falling apart. My father is... he‚Äôs slipping. His research is consuming him; he spends days locked in his lab, convinced that the answers are just out of reach. He‚Äôs becoming... obsessed.‚Äù She took a shaky breath. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt find some kind of closure, I‚Äôm afraid we‚Äôll lose him too.‚Äù

Renno was silent, his thoughts drifting to Thadaka‚Äôs lair‚Äîa place that had once been a desolate fortress of darkness. Now, it had transformed into a thriving forest teeming with life, albeit twisted life. Demons of various sizes, nymphs, and strange battle beasts roamed among the dense foliage, remnants of Thadaka's corrupting influence. The world was rebuilding itself, but scars remained.

**Later That Day:**

Renno and Sreya sat together in the research room, going over data logs and audio recordings from the day of the incident. Renno found himself spending more time in her company, drawn to her quiet determination. He admired the way she would pore over documents, searching for any clue, any anomaly that might explain what happened to Tom.

While handing her a stack of documents, Renno‚Äôs hand brushed against Sreya‚Äôs. A sudden, vivid flash overtook his mind‚ÄîSreya was smiling, radiant in the sunlight, cradling a child in her arms. He was there too, standing by her side, a feeling of peace washing over him. It felt impossibly real, yet distant, as if he were peering into a life that wasn‚Äôt his own.

Renno recoiled, his face pale. ‚ÄúI... I saw something,‚Äù he stammered.

‚ÄúWhat did you see?‚Äù Sreya asked, her brow furrowing in concern.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Renno replied, shaking his head. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt control these visions. They come and go as they please. I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I‚Äôll ever truly understand them.‚Äù

**Later That Night:**

Renno sat alone in his quarters, the silence pressing in around him. His thoughts wandered back to Tom‚Äîhis brother in all but blood. They had been war orphans, cast adrift in a world that had no place for children. Tom had always looked after him, sharing what little food they had, taking the blame when Renno‚Äôs mischief got them into trouble.

One night stood out in Renno‚Äôs memory. It had been cold, and their rations had run low. Tom had handed him the last of the bread, saying, ‚ÄúEat up, kiddo. I‚Äôm not hungry.‚Äù Renno had seen through the lie, but he took the bread anyway, knowing Tom would never accept a refusal.

And there was the time when Tom saved the entire squad during a skirmish in the Ashen Plains. He had rushed into the line of fire to pull a wounded comrade to safety, holding off an enemy advance single-handedly until reinforcements arrived. Renno had been there too, frozen, useless. Tom had never blamed him for it, but the guilt had gnawed at Renno ever since.

The memories flooded his senses, and a single tear escaped down his cheek, then another. He buried his face in his hands, overwhelmed by a sorrow he hadn‚Äôt allowed himself to feel. For the first time in a long while, he cried‚Äîdeep, wracking sobs that seemed to echo through the empty room.

**The Next Morning:**

Sreya found him on the training grounds, his eyes red-rimmed and weary. She approached slowly, hesitant to intrude upon his grief. ‚ÄúRenno,‚Äù she began, her voice gentle. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to go through this alone.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt respond, but she could see the pain in his eyes. She placed a hand on his shoulder. ‚ÄúTom was always there for you,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúBut now you need to be there for yourself too.‚Äù

Renno looked at her, his voice hoarse. ‚ÄúI should have seen it coming. I should have known...‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt blame yourself for everything,‚Äù Sreya said, a soft resolve in her voice. ‚ÄúTom wouldn‚Äôt want that. He‚Äôd want you to keep going, to find answers.‚Äù

She hesitated before adding, ‚ÄúI never told anyone, but... I had feelings for Tom. I didn‚Äôt know if he felt the same way, and now... I may never know.‚Äù

Renno‚Äôs expression softened, the confession catching him off guard. It was as if a puzzle piece had fallen into place, yet it made his vision of the future even more confusing. He had seen happiness with Sreya, but now he wondered if it was ever truly meant for him.",1,1729859840.0,PrakashamParakkatte,0,1.0,False

I worked at another store and overheard their SM promoting a barista to a higher rate (same DM). I did some math with my 6 year tenure vs shift/barista pay gap of 27% and I should have been offered what the girl at the other store was offered at least, based on what I was making as a barista.

Now I'm stepping down for school and the pay calculator has cut me to barista staring wages which is way below where I was before I got promoted. My first schedule as a barista comes out the day my SM comes back from vacation and he never mentioned anything about my availability or pay before he went on vacation.

Obviously I'm going to confront him first, but if they still cut me to starting, can I go to HR and make an appeal based on what I know others are making and the fact that I wasn't given the same amount as the other girl from the other store? I just want at least what I was making as a barista, especially since I'm a coffee master, former ssv, and have been here for 6 years.

(Side note: before I transferred to this store I was making about as much as a barista as I am as a shift now and the pay calculator brought me down to what I was making before I got promoted.

While both products are designed to enhance flavors and provide sweetness, there are important differences between the two. So, which should you choose? In this article, we will explore the key distinctions between [squashes and syrups](https://www.truegether.com/category/home-and-garden), their ingredients, health impacts, and some practical tips for when and how to use them. By the end, you will have a better idea of which option is best for your needs.

**What is Squash?**

Squash is a fruit-based concentrated liquid that is typically diluted with water or other liquids to create a refreshing beverage. Often called ""fruit cordial"" or ""concentrate"" in some parts of the world, squash is popular in regions like the UK, Australia, and India. It‚Äôs a go-to option for anyone looking to add flavor to water without the heavy sugars or additives found in carbonated drinks.

**Ingredients and Composition of Squash**

Squashes are usually made with fruit juice (real or synthetic), sugar, and preservatives. More health-conscious brands are now offering versions with natural sweeteners like stevia or honey instead of refined sugar. Some modern squashes even include additional vitamins, especially vitamin C, making them a slightly healthier option for families.

A typical 250ml glass of squash mixed with water contains about **10-20 kcal** and **3-5g of sugar**, depending on the brand and the type of fruit concentrate used. Compared to sodas, which can have around **140 kcal** and **35g of sugar** per the same serving, squash is a significantly lighter choice.

**Popular Flavors and Varieties**

Squash comes in a variety of flavors, with fruit flavors like orange, lemon, lime, and blackcurrant being the most popular. You can also find more exotic flavors like mango, pineapple, or passionfruit. Brands such as Robinsons (UK) and Kissan (India) are popular for their broad range of fruit squash offerings.

In recent years, there‚Äôs been a surge in ""no added sugar"" versions of squash. According to a report by **Nielsen**, sales of no-added-sugar drinks grew by **22%** in the last decade, indicating a shift towards healthier options in the beverage sector.

**What Are Syrups?**

Syrups, on the other hand, are thicker, more viscous liquids made by dissolving sugar into water, sometimes mixed with fruit extracts or flavorings. Unlike squash, syrups are often used in small quantities because of their intense sweetness and rich texture. Syrups are commonly used for sweetening desserts, coffee, pancakes, and cocktails.

**Ingredients and Composition of Syrups**

Most syrups are made by heating sugar and water together until a thick liquid forms. Fruit syrups will often contain fruit extracts, while flavored syrups might have vanilla, caramel, or chocolate flavors. Corn syrup, a cheaper alternative, is often used in commercial food production due to its long shelf life and low cost.

A single tablespoon of syrup contains about **50-70 kcal** and **12-18g of sugar**, depending on the brand and flavor. For example, a tablespoon of maple syrup contains approximately **52 kcal** and **13.4g of sugar**, according to the USDA. This makes syrups more caloric and sugar-dense compared to squash, which is typically diluted before consumption.

**Popular Syrup Varieties**

Syrups come in a wide range of flavors and uses. Common types include maple syrup, agave syrup, and simple syrup (commonly used in cocktails). Fruit syrups such as raspberry, cherry, and strawberry are also popular, especially in European cuisine. Companies like **Torani** and **Monin** have made flavored syrups mainstream, expanding into more complex and exotic flavors like lavender and elderflower, often used in high-end cafes and restaurants.

**Health Considerations: Which Is Better?**

When deciding between squash and syrup, it‚Äôs essential to consider the health implications, particularly sugar content and calories.

**Sugar Content**

One of the most significant differences between squashes and syrups lies in their sugar content. Squashes are typically lower in sugar per serving because they are meant to be diluted with water. A **200ml serving** of diluted squash generally contains **2-5g of sugar**, depending on the brand. In contrast, syrups are highly concentrated and used in smaller amounts, but they are sugar-dense. A single tablespoon of syrup can contain **12-18g of sugar**, making it less ideal for those monitoring their sugar intake.

According to the **World Health Organization**, the recommended daily intake of sugar for adults is about **25g (6 teaspoons)** per day. Given this, even one serving of syrup can take up a significant portion of your daily allowance, whereas squash, especially no-added-sugar versions, allows for more flexibility.

**Calories**

Since squash is diluted, the calorie content per serving is also relatively low. On average, a **200ml glass** of squash will contain **20-30 kcal**, which is much lower than the **50-70 kcal** per tablespoon in syrups. This makes squash a better choice for anyone seeking a low-calorie way to flavor drinks and foods.

**Artificial Ingredients**

Both squashes and syrups can contain artificial ingredients, though this depends largely on the brand. Squashes are often more likely to include preservatives and artificial colorings, particularly if they are marketed as shelf-stable. Syrups, on the other hand, may contain artificial flavorings, particularly for more exotic varieties like blue raspberry or caramel.

If you prefer more natural products, opt for premium brands that focus on all-natural ingredients. In the last **five years**, consumer preference for natural, preservative-free products has increased by **30%**, according to research from **Mintel**.

**Practical Applications: When to Choose Squash vs. Syrups**

**Squash for Everyday Refreshment**

If you're looking for a refreshing, low-sugar drink option, squash is ideal. It's easy to mix into water for a quick beverage that isn't packed with sugar. Squashes are especially popular for families because they provide hydration with minimal added calories, and kids love the fruity flavors.

You can also use squash as a mixer in cocktails or mocktails, adding a fruity punch without the sweetness overload that syrups bring. A **2019 survey** by **Euromonitor** revealed that **50%** of consumers prefer squash for its light, thirst-quenching qualities, especially in warm climates.

**Syrups for Desserts and Special Drinks**

Syrups shine when it comes to dessert-making and specialty drinks. From drizzling over pancakes to flavoring coffees, syrups provide richness and depth of flavor that squash can‚Äôt. They are also essential in cocktails where a thick, sweet base is needed. For example, classic cocktails like an Old Fashioned or a Mojito wouldn‚Äôt be complete without a bit of simple syrup.

That said, because of their high sugar content, syrups should be used sparingly if you're watching your calorie or sugar intake. A study by **Harvard Health** found that overconsumption of syrups and other sugary products is linked to increased risks of obesity and type 2 diabetes, which makes moderation key.

**Conclusion: Which Should You Choose?**

Ultimately, the choice between squash and syrup depends on your needs and preferences. Squash is the better option if you're seeking a low-calorie, hydrating drink that's light on sugar. It's practical for everyday use and family-friendly. On the other hand, syrups are ideal for indulgent moments, whether you're making a rich dessert or crafting a perfect cocktail.

The key takeaway is to consider both the nutritional content and your intended use. If you're mindful of sugar and calorie intake, squash will serve you well. However, for those looking for richer flavors or culinary applications, syrups can add a delightful, sweet touch to your creations.

I was making more money than I ever thought I'd make in my life (I worked in a computer shop prior to this job making $15 an hour, so going to a salaried job paying more than double that felt incredible) and I felt like I owed this place everything. I jumped at any opportunity to go above and beyond for this place, it was an extremely stressful work environment since there'd be so many deadlines and I'd volunteer for so many things that I often had to work late hours to meet those deadlines. We got paid overtime when it was approved through a ticket but when I was working until 10PM to finish a project that was due the next morning that was entirely on my own time. 

I worked at this job for 8 years, the CTO would constantly fight me on things that were so blatantly wrong, he would never let me take on larger enterprise equipment despite me having the required base knowledge of how VoIP worked, far better than he knew, he went on a drunken rant once on the phone because he was angry I helped a coworker configure a firewall without the CTO's help.

I felt it was okay since they were already paying me so much money. Then COVID hit, we struggled since so much of our income came from new office build outs where we would be doing cabling jobs, plus our largest client moved to another PBX vendor due to a sponsorship deal. I ended up getting laid off since I was the most junior member in the team. 

I took one day ""off"" to feel depressed, and got to work the next day trying to find a job. I had an offer within a week that threw in a 33% raise with an offer for even more after 6 months if things work out well. I quickly learned I had been taken advantage of for all those years, I had the knowledge in my field to get paid way more. The job was rough but not as bad as my first, but there were just constant fires at the new place that needed to be put out because no one pre-planned anything and we had no standard method to do anything so everything was a one off custom job. I was the most knowledgeable person at the company so I quickly became ""the guy"", especially since the other two level 3 guys had quit shortly after I started. The CTO was the owners brother, I would constantly come in to a slew of tickets, call him to ask what happened and his response would be ""...why?"" whenever he made an unplanned change the night before that I now had to undo. Two years and no raises later, they did end up hiring someone to be on my team and take some of the workload off my shoulders, but I got a call from the recruiter that got me the job (when they hired a new COO he fired the recruiter) and got two much better offers to work elsewhere.

I ended up taking one of the offers, enjoyed the new job for a while, felt a bit stressed about having to log time on projects constantly but I managed. It was hybrid so I could work from home two days, during this job I got married to my girlfriend that was with me through all the previous employers and we ended up having a baby. During my paid parental leave there were major change ups to the company, they were losing money (old school on premise telecom is a dying industry) and needed to tighten the purse string as well as change up the process. The micromanagement of my day to day got so much worse, my boss changed and the new boss decided we would do one project at a time instead of multiple so we could close that one project in 30 days rather than taking months. What he failed to realize was that the customer was the reason a project took months to close. We work only on the customers schedule, so having one project meant I had to make up things on my time sheet since the customer might be available 8 hours a week at most, the rest of the time I'm looking for things to do. I let this be known constantly. The stress of lying about what I was doing at work to fill up a time sheet was so much worse than any other job I've had. I was looking for a new position elsewhere to avoid a mental breakdown of dealing with an infant and the work stress and after 6 months I finally landed something.

I found my dream job. Literally the job I dreamt of having as a teen that enjoyed finding PCs in the trash and installing Linux on them. It pays double the previous job, it took a lot of effort not to start hyperventilating at the number I saw since I received the letter while I was on the phone interviewing. I have 100% healthcare coverage (I have no monthly payment at all), 401K matching, daily food allowance, all the snacks and drinks I could ever want at my disposal, cold brew coffee on tap, and the best perk of all is having a competent team. Not only are they competent, they were all ""the guy"" at their previous jobs and have the same ""Let's take this apart and see how it works"" mentality I grew up with. I've never been happier working in my life, I'm in a typically high stress industry but there really hasn't been much stress at all for my team, you might get an urgent request but we pre-plan and have backup solutions and methods to fix things quickly while we can spend time analyzing the root cause of the issue. Every day I remember how awful my previous jobs were and I feel like I'm going to wake up from this dream and be stuck back where I was, but I'm enjoying the dream for now.

Anyway, thanks for coming to my TED talk.

TL;DR, my old jobs treated me so poorly that I don't feel like my current job that treats me so well is actually real...",9,1729859507.0,sysadmin,12,0.74,False

1gbt320,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1gbt320/feeling_pressure_to_spend_time_with_friends_when/,Feeling pressure to spend time with friends when I have a 4 month old,"So I‚Äôm a first time mom 30F on maternity leave with my 4 month old baby. The past few months have been truly wonderful and exhausting. I had a rough recovery after giving birth followed by learning how to take care of a newborn. My baby and I have spent a decent amount of time with my friends - going for walks, out for lunch, visits, even a few weddings. Now that it‚Äôs October, and baby is on a little bit more of a nap & sleep schedule, I am not really in the mood to make plans these days. I feel like every time I pick up my phone I have a different friend wanting to make plans, and often when I try to say I can‚Äôt right now because of baby they say ‚Äúwell I‚Äôll come to you!‚Äù But I‚Äôm not always up for visits. I told my husband the other day we‚Äôve been SO busy since baby has been born, we had everyone visit us constantly at the start, and it‚Äôs like as soon as everyone met him we would get more texts and calls with people looking to visit for a second time already. I remember I would constantly say I need a ‚Äúrest day‚Äù but also feel guilty when I don‚Äôt respond to people. 

A lot of my friends are not moms and are the type to make plans days or weeks ahead - I am typically the same it‚Äôs just that my situation has changed these days. Their availability is typically either week day evenings, or weekends. I don‚Äôt love doing anything during the evenings these days, it‚Äôs just hard when I would rather be here for baby‚Äôs bed time and also get sleep of my own. A friend sent me an option of 6 days that she is free where I can have her over for coffee - so I of course felt obligated to pick one of those days. And as great as coffee sounds, sometimes the day comes and I‚Äôm just not up for it. I‚Äôve just been enjoying my little baby bubble by myself at home.

I know this seems like it isn‚Äôt a huge problem, and I‚Äôve thought about just putting my phone down and not answering people for a bit (that‚Äôs hard because I do like to post stories on instagram). I also know they mean well! I have really great friends who love and want to see my baby, which is why I hate saying no to them.

I‚Äôm not really the type of person to commit to plans with someone knowing I will bail closer too, it just gives me anxiety knowing I‚Äôm going to eventually bail. I know I could be straight forward and say something along the lines of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really feel like making plans right now‚Äù, but thats typically when I get hit with ‚Äúwell I‚Äôll come to you!‚Äù 

Anyways - what should I do? What would you do? Should I put the phone down and not answer anyone for a bit?

I drove about 500 miles before I noticed any issue. 

I was in line to get coffee in the morning and I noticed some smoke coming from the hood and the temp started to rise at the same time. I parked instantly and turned the car off. Ran the heat and waited until it cooled. 

Noticed i was extremely low on coolant so I imagine it was slowly leaking the entire time I did the 500 miles and when the coolant level was to low it caused the heat to rise. 

I filled the radiator and the over flow.  Haven't noticed any level drop since but only did about 25 miles and sat running for 30 minutes to look for another over heat. The puddle was nothing major less then a AC would leave when your running parked so I was Def real low on coolant.  

Water pump seems good,  thermostat good, and fans running. 

Just wondering if the jb weld option will hold for a few days until the radiator come. I figure I'll do about 100 miles in that time.  Maybe 150. I'll also keep an eye on the fluid level during the time. 

Don't want to use stop leak as I really don't want to pull the thermostat to run it. Plus the stuff is junk.

*The story emerged from an initial concept where we discussed how, over time, humanity‚Äôs perception of reality has evolved‚Äîthrough ideas like the concept of zero, the notions of future, ownership, and other foundational shifts. We imagined what a similar shift might look like in a future society, where people experience reality in ways we can‚Äôt fully imagine today. ChatGPT then introduced the intriguing idea of neuro-temporal synchronization, where past, present, and future could blend within one‚Äôs perception. From there, we explored how such a transformation might impact daily life, relationships, and societal norms. This journey felt like true co-creation: a fascinating exploration of speculative ideas shaped by both human curiosity and AI creativity.*

# Reflections of the Possible

The city's hum envelops me as I walk along the illuminated sidewalks. Holographic billboards broadcast their messages, but I don't need to read them to understand their content. Information flows around me, floating like fragments of thoughts accessible to those who know how to perceive them.

Since the advent of neuro-temporal synchronization, our perception of the world has evolved. We're no longer limited to the present moment; we can glimpse possible futures, feel echoes of the recent past. This expanded consciousness has transformed how we think, interact, and live.

I'm heading to the caf√© where I'm meeting Elena. On the way, I stroll through a lively park. Children play, their laughter echoing like a melody. One of them chases after a ball rolling on the grass. I perceive possible futures where the ball veers toward the nearby pond. Without thinking, I step in and gently nudge the ball with my foot, redirecting it back to the child. He smiles at me gratefully.

""Thank you, sir!""

I return his smile. Children haven't fully developed their synchronization yet; their perceptions are fragmentary, constantly evolving. They live more in the present moment, exploring the world with unbridled curiosity.

Further along, I pass a giant screen broadcasting a soccer match. The players on the field move with remarkable fluidity. Each anticipates the other's moves, creating a game of fascinating complexity. Passes are precise, feints ingenious. Despite their abilities, unpredictability remains. A striker executes an unexpected maneuver, outwitting the defense and scoring a spectacular goal. The crowd erupts, surprised and delighted.

I continue on, reflecting on how perceiving possible futures enriches our existence while preserving the spontaneity that makes life vibrant. Arriving at the caf√©, a warm atmosphere greets me. The aroma of freshly ground coffee and pastries fills the air.

The waiter, a young man with a friendly smile, approaches me.

""Your usual table is ready, sir. Would you like your regular drink, or would you like to try our special of the day?""

I sense that he's already prepared my favorite beverage, anticipating my probable response. However, I decide to switch things up.

""I'll try the special, thank you.""

He nods enthusiastically. ""Excellent choice! I'll bring it right over.""

I settle at my table, observing the comings and goings. The waiter navigates effortlessly among the patrons, his synchronization allowing him to anticipate needs and requests. He intercepts a wobbling tray before a cup can fall, offers a kind word to a customer whose mood he senses is sour, adjusts the music slightly in anticipation of a large group's arrival.

Elena doesn't take long to arrive. I sense her presence before she even enters‚Äîa familiar sensation that precedes her appearance. Our eyes meet, and I discern a hint of hesitation in hers.

""Hello,"" she says, sitting down. ""Sorry I'm late.""

""No worries. How are you?""

She takes a breath. ""I received an offer to join the Chronos Project. They're looking to extend synchronization even further, to allow perception of more distant futures.""

I nod. ""That's an interesting opportunity but also a significant challenge. What do you think?""

""I'm torn. The idea of anticipating long-term consequences is tempting, but I'm afraid of losing touch with the present.""

I ponder for a moment. ""Perceiving the near future helps us daily, but going too far might distance us from the present moment. There's beauty in life's unpredictability.""

She smiles slightly. ""Always so wise. Maybe I should focus on what I have here and now.""

The waiter returns with our drinks. ""Here's a special infusion with flavors from afar.""

""Thank you very much,"" we reply in unison.

As he walks away, Elena watches him. ""He's impressive, isn't he? He anticipates his customers' every need.""

""Yes, he fully utilizes his synchronization to create an enjoyable experience.""

""It reminds me that the essential thing isn't necessarily to see further but to better use what we already have.""

We continue our discussion, our exchanges navigating between personal projects and reflections on our society. The conversation flows smoothly, enriched by our ability to perceive the nuances and possible reactions of the other without stripping away the spontaneity of our exchanges.

""Have you ever thought about temporarily deactivating your synchronization?"" she suddenly asks.

I look at her, surprised. ""Sometimes, yes. To refocus, to fully live in the present without future echoes.""

""What if we tried it together? Just for a moment.""

I sense in her a deep desire for simplicity, to rediscover a form of purity in experience.

""Alright. Now?""

She nods. We activate the temporary suspension mode. Immediately, the world seems to change subtly. Projections of possible futures fade, leaving only the present‚Äîraw and immediate.

I feel a slight apprehension, quickly replaced by a new intensity. Sounds, colors, sensations are more vivid. I'm entirely present, undistracted.

""How do you feel?"" she asks.

""It's... different. More intense. And you?""

""The same. It's both disconcerting and exhilarating.""

We savor our drinks, rediscovering flavors without anticipation. Each sip is a surprise; every expression on the other's face is a mystery to decode.

The waiter returns to check on our satisfaction. Without synchronization, I can't anticipate his words. He surprises us by offering a dessert as a thank-you for our loyalty.

""That's very kind of you,"" I say sincerely.

He smiles. ""It's my pleasure. Enjoy your evening.""

This simple interaction fills me with joy. I realize that without perceiving possible futures, each moment gains authenticity.

After leaving the caf√©, we stroll through the bustling streets. The city's lights shine with new intensity. The conversations of passersby, the sounds of traffic‚Äîall seem to form a living symphony.

""It's amazing how we get used to predicting things,"" Elena remarks. ""And how we forget the beauty of the unknown.""

""Yes. This experience makes me think that perhaps we should balance both. Use our synchronization without being enslaved by it.""

She looks at me with a glint of mischief. ""Are you ready to become unpredictable again?""

I laugh. ""As much as possible.""

In the days that follow, we alternate between synchronized moments and unsynchronized ones. This alternation allows us to rediscover the world from different angles, enriching our understanding and appreciation of life.

One afternoon, we attend a soccer match at the stadium. The players move with impressive mastery, anticipating their opponents' actions. Yet some deliberately deactivate their synchronization during plays to surprise the opposing team.

One player, known for his bold strategies, executes an unexpected dribble, scoring a decisive goal. The crowd goes wild, celebrating human ingenuity that transcends technological capabilities.

Elena turns to me. ""See? Even with all our advancements, it's the human spirit that makes the difference.""

""Absolutely. Technology is a tool, but it's our creativity and will that define how we use it.""

Back in the city, we pass by an art gallery showcasing interactive works. One piece reacts to viewers' emotions, creating shapes and colors based on perceived feelings. We stop to observe.

""It's fascinating,"" Elena murmurs. ""Art that directly dialogues with our inner being.""

""Yes, it's another way to perceive the multiple facets of reality.""

She smiles. ""You know, I think I'll decline the Chronos Project offer. I'd rather deepen what we already have than always seek further.""

I take her hand. ""Whatever your decision, I'll support you.""

We continue our walk, enjoying the twilight that envelops the city. Echoes of the past and reflections of the future blend harmoniously, but we choose to focus on the present, savoring each moment.

Over time, we find a balance between synchronization and immediate experience. We learn to use our perceptions to enrich our lives without becoming dependent on them. Our relationship flourishes, nourished by this new understanding.

One evening, as we gaze at the stars from a rooftop, Elena rests her head on my shoulder.

""Do you think our society can find this balance?""

I contemplate. ""It's possible if everyone realizes the importance of fully living in the present while being aware of possibilities. It takes time and willingness.""

""Then let's make sure we set an example.""

I smile. ""With pleasure.""

Life continues, full of surprises and possibilities. We move forward together, one step at a time, open to the multiple paths before us but never losing sight of the richness of the present moment.

## Epilogue

At the caf√©, the waiter continues to navigate effortlessly among the patrons. He's learned to integrate his perception of possible futures to provide impeccable service while appreciating spontaneous interactions that arise. He knows that each person is unique, that despite technology, the human essence lies in the unexpected and authenticity.

One day, he notices a couple sitting by the window. They seem fully present, their gazes locked. He perceives they've chosen to deactivate their synchronization, at least for a time. Intrigued and touched, he decides to offer them a special dessert without anticipating their reaction.

The couple, surprised and delighted, thank him warmly. The waiter feels deep satisfaction, realizing that sometimes, not knowing makes things more beautiful.

Thus, in a world where the future is accessible, many rediscover the value of the present moment. Technology isn't an end in itself but a means to enrich our lives, provided we know how to use it wisely.

## Conclusion

This story reflects a society seeking balance between anticipating possible futures and the richness of the present moment. The characters learn to navigate between these two worlds, discovering that the true essence of life lies in harmonizing what we can foresee with what we choose to experience spontaneously.",1,1729859015.0,WritingWithAI,1,0.67,False

1gbsu6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1gbsu6s/ive_lost_friends_because_of_my_bpd_wife/,I¬¥ve lost friends because of my BPD wife.,"First a disclaimer. Despite the title, I don¬¥t want for anyone to be blamed. I want to talk about my mistakes only here. All people I will mention are good people and their mistakes doesn¬¥t matter here.

I¬¥ve met my, now wife 4 years ago. And she was a typical BPD. I was a guy who go kicked out of school because I just gamed for days rather than studying. I solved sucking at life by more gaming.

BPD and a degen gamer, what a combo. I gamed with my friends. Hours every day. And BPD can¬¥t have that with her favourite person, right? So a lot of toxicity started coming up quite soon. Details are not important.

She was controling me, making me responsible for her problems, manipulating me etc. My friends saw all the red flags. They¬¥ve met IRL couple times and they basically started hating each other.

My wife wanted me to stop talking to them, they wanted me to break up with her. And I was trapped in the middle of it, with a bonus of running a family caf√© during Covid, when I couldn¬¥t pay myself a reasonable wage.

Few years go by and me and my wife are now doing really well. My wife worked so hard on herself and basically there is no BPD to speak of. We were able to solve all those red flags. We have great communication, I enjoy life with her, she supports me so much now. She is kind and patient, just an awesome human to be with. She mentiones to me from time to time I should contact my friends, even though she really doesn¬¥t like them.

And that is the problem. I, trapped in the middle of all that shit few years ago, I¬¥ve done the thing I can do best. Just disappeared. Stopped responding to them. Ghosted them. They reached out, I didn¬¥t respond. They tried again, we went for a coffee, I ghosted them again. That happened multiple times over the last few years. I just fucked them over again and again. I don¬¥t really know why. Last I talked to them probably like a year ago, but I am not really sure.

And even when we met, it was like remembering the good old days while knowing, that those are past. Like we all know it is over, just don¬¥t want to accept it.

The best thing for them would be to just leave me be. I just keep hurting them. They reach out, I tell them how everything is great and then ghost them two days later. I am really ashamed for that.

And few weeks ago, one of them, my BFF, whom I probably hurt the most, reached out to me again and I not that I didn¬¥t respond, I didn¬¥t even read the message. She is still a BFF to me. I love all those people so much, they stuck with me for so long and I can¬¥t even respond to a fucking message and I am sick and tired and disgusted by myself.

And few days ago, another friend just invited me to join them for a party celebrating her and her husbands new house. I fucking didn¬¥t open that either.

Four years of me screwing them over and they are still not done with me and are just kind to me.

I have a different life now. I am happy, I have a wife whom I love dearly and who is the best thing in my life. But they are still missing and I have to try to make things right with them. It would just be so much easier if they were at least angry with me...

And even if i start the contact with them again, what then? We were friends when we were together in school. After that we gamed together basically every day. That is easy to hold a connection with people you talk to everyday. We don¬¥t live far, so yeah, we can see each other from time to time, but I can¬¥t get back to gaming for hours everyday with them. I don¬¥t know whether they even do that... I spent 6 years worth of time of my 27 years of life gaming. 47000 hours. Don¬¥t get me wrong, I absolutely love it and I don¬¥t regret a single minute of it, but enough is enough.

I know this is not directly BPD related, but I know you guy and gals here, you are experts at blowing relationships into pieces and then trying to put them back. And this is one of the best communities I¬¥ve met on them internets.

EDIT: I am going for a walk to clear my head. I¬¥ll then open the messages, accept the invitation, say sorry and send them this post and ask them to read it, because what is the worst that can happen? I feel like shit anyway, can¬¥t be really that much worse and I don¬¥t talk to them now either, so...",1,1729858608.0,BPD,0,0.6,False

Got quite a following on socials. Got experience and skills on YouTube (with a very different topic, but still).

Here's why I want to start a podcast: because I love to listen to podcasts, but I hate the few that I found on special needs (I find them monotone, sad, not impactful). The only good one we had in Australia shut doors earlier this year. I got lots to say and lots of ideas. Good content (yeah, I'm biased...but it's good).

My rookie plan: record contextually video and audio, and post both YouTube video and podcast episode (yes, video! Remember, I'm good at YouTube, I could really have an ""unfair advantage""). If solo episode: around 15 minutes (some bonus episodes only 5-6 minutes). Interviews: 45 minutes. 10 episodes per year. 1 per month, and 2 months of review + plan next year of episodes.

Now, it's your turn:

1. Do you see something in my plan that is already NOT working?  
2. Which videos/articles or similar should I watch/read to educate myself on how to do podcasts? Possibly stuff that is good for dummies, I'm not as tech-savvy as you kiddos!  
3. Which resources should I NOT lose my time on (like ""hey, that YouTuber sells a terrible idea of podcasts! Don't listen to that!"")  
4. Money: well...gimme your best tips and/or resources to educate myself on how to monetise this new journey sooner rather than later, and (once I'll make money) I'll buy you a coffee!

Thank you heaps for reading this all and for your advice!",1,1729858536.0,podcasting,4,1.0,False

However sometimes when i fast, i drink two glasses of white wine (maybe 3 if I‚Äôm pushing it). Would it ruin the whole fasting experience? I also drink cup of black coffee in the morning when i fast. 

Would love to hear from people who experienced it & from people who are experienced in fasting in general!
