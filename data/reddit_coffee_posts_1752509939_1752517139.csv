The gynaecologist dismissed my worries about cancer and said that there were not really alternatives to birth control or IUD. Is there any things that you’ve done to help your endometriosis. I’m beyond frustrated with the healthcare I’ve been receiving.

1lztwa1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypoglycemia/comments/1lztwa1/glucose_reading_of_29/,Glucose reading of 29?,"So I got a call this morning after having bloodwork done on Friday for my thyroid because I have hyperthyroidism. Nurse from the endocrinologist’s office called and was asking how I was feeling that day. I woke up feeling awful with what I assumed was another migraine as I have almost daily headaches. 

She informed me my glucose was 29. This meant absolutely nothing to me given that I’ve never knowingly had glucose issues, it’s just always been another random line on bloodwork reports.  She asked if the headache meds help- and they didn’t. Asked if I felt nauseous and I said yes. She said if I started feeling off, I might need to go to urgent care. 

She called again later asking what I had eaten. I had a pack of ritz crackers, coffee with sugar, tea with sugar and maybe some chips. I don’t know if any of this helps of not. 

After googling I realize how serious this was. I had driven myself an hour one way to get bloodwork done, and the potential effects are unnerving. So, I’m not sure if I’m about to start this journey or not. I’ve bought a glucose monitor to start tracking if they call back and say they want me to. I have several medical conditions that I don’t know if maybe this has been an underlying issue exacerbating them or what. I have migraines, hyperthyroidism, HyperPOTS to name a few. I don’t know how any of this effects the others, but from the little I’ve read so far- it seems like it could be. 

Any thoughts, experience, actions I should start taking before I see the doctor again, what to look for? Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated. ",2,1752516734.0,Hypoglycemia,0,1.0,False

1lztvfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateExam/comments/1lztvfd/passed_az_salesperson_exam_in_4_weeks_some_tips/,Passed AZ salesperson exam in 4 weeks. Some tips and timeline,"I used Aceable Agent and got a premium package at $359. Searched for a 40% off father's day coupon. This package includes the 90 hour class, 6 hour contract writing class, and PrepAgent. I started the class on 6/18, took the Aceable final exam on 7/10, and took the state exam on 7/13.

I was not working, no kids, so I pretty much had all day and night and weekends. But I still ran errands, cooked, hung out etc. The class was 90 hours but I feel I spent nearly double that time? Breaks are important! So definitely budget your time wisely as you are working towards this. I was not aware of how much time I needed to pour into this until after I started.

Overall I thought the Aceable class was pretty good. Make sure you understand the concepts as you go through the content. Don't rush. I was taking notes in my Notes app. And I needed breaks because it was A LOT of content and new concepts.  After finishing up all the Aceable content, on 7/7, I started reviewing my notes per chapter, and for each chapter, I took practice tests on Aceable, averaging about 2 tests per chapter.  I wrote down notes on everything I had missed.

Then I took the practice exam on Aceable. Scored 92% on 7/9. I called around community colleges in the Phoenix area, and found one that could accommodate me for my final exam. I scored 94%.

Meanwhile I started doing tests on Prepagent. Oh my. Questions are a LOT harder than Aceable. I panicked a bit. I was averaging 70-80% for everything other than math. I did randomized master exams 4 times, so that's about 400 questions. I also did some chapter tests. Again, study the questions, make notes, don't just rush through them. But as I would later find out, the questions RESEMBLE those asked on the state exam. I saw a few EXACT questions I had seen on PrepAgent. I did not use any other features like tutoring on PrepAgent. 

I thought, what the hell I'll just try it. So I scheduled my state exam, and I used nearly 4.5 hours agonizing over and over a lot of questions. It was not easy, including mentally. There was drinking water, restroom.. .I brought an energy bar and a coffee. No pens/scratch papers - those will be provided in the form of a erasable whiteboard.

Then as I came out of the test center, my phone died in my car since I couldn't bring it in and it was so hot 🤣

1lzts30,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1lzts30/i_think_i_have_an_eating_disorder/,I think I have an eating disorder.,"I think I might have an eating disorder today due to a lot of things starting in my childhood, heightened by my adolescense and following me into my adulthood. I grew up in a food abundant house. However there were foods I used to like that were reserved for my brother for instance ""Choc Bites"" - one of my favourite cereals (South African) but only my brother was allowed to eat it. Everytime I would make myself food in the house my dad would comment on how much I ate even if it wasn't a lot, I was chubby. Everytime I made myself snack I was expected to make for everybody else too, I could never just make myself food without cooking for the whole family. My mom put me on diets, she would go on the diets with me - General Motors diet, Nomad diet, a diet where you only had a coffee and egg a day, greentea fasts, slimming teas, even slimming lotions and she bought me waist trainers. In highschool I did ""Bob Harper's skinny rules"" and I was also bulmic. If I did eat something sweet like chocolate I only chewed it and spat it out not swallowing. Or I would lock myself in the bathroom at home and eat a whole avocado for fear of judgment. I remember one time, eating a packet of chips and my dad told me that people have a packet of chips for lunch that was enough for the day. Lived on my own for a while and my dad although my family is generally wealthy, didn't give me enough to have a social life and keep the fridge full and I had moved in on campus with my uncle and I bought that feeling of not being able to cook myself unless I made for everybody else with me, so stuff my mom bought me would rot. I come from a family with a history of domestic violence, Gender based violence, emotional, verbal and psychological abuse as well as financial abuse - taking away my money, car as a form of punishment. My mom passed away and the violence she was experiencing from my dad shifted to me. Dad then started doing something he had never done before which is using food as a form of punishment, not being allowed to eat, cook, make yourself a snack without commentary or abuse. Just eating in the kitchen or making myself food became a nightmare. He still expected me to cook everytime, I made myself food, despite abusing me and his new wife not doing anything in the house and I refused. I used to fast in highschool, through uni because I wasn't eating enough and this year I will fast sometimes water fast for spiritual reasons but sometimes, I worry this is just an excuse to not deal with food, When I eat I sometimes don't enjoy the taste of food, it just turns to something in my mouth I can't swallow especially at home, I really no longer can eat at home. Periods of fighting then having to down food and it just turns to mush in my mouth, I barely finish what I make myself. Fast forward to today, managed to leave a violent home, but I worry sometimes about where my next meal will come from having once gone days after being kicked out of home without food, I have the same issues around pleasure too, experiencing sexual pleasure I was molested at 5. And also my parents were very anti-sex, anti-boys I remember my mom threatening to beat me when she found a diary entry of a crush I had on boy, I think mostly because my parents not only absolutely hated each other but were revolted by each other  most of the time and they probably weren't having sex in their marriage. I was just expected to be a machine growing without hormones, feelings, wants, desires, passions. Today I gravitate towards BDSM. ",1,1752516474.0,ptsd,1,1.0,False

I went with my dad to Vancouver a couple years back and my siblings seemed so excited for me and I know my mom likes the cold growing up in Argentina. 

My mom and I are definitely more of a play in the snow, chill with a warm coffee or cocoa kind of vibe, if there’s a hot spring I’m sure my mom would love it. My siblings are super super active, would probably love to do more sports or active things like sledding, skiing, all that jazz.

I am fortunate enough to be in a position where I can save up around 5k ish to eventually treat them to a vacation like this, so I’d like to go somewhere safe and fun for families, preferably nothing too too crowded so we don’t feel in the way. Anything more family friendly would be nice. I’ve had very limited snowy experiences, so any further advice would be nice.

Meanwhile my gf has nothing to say to defend me as her mom continues to harass me over the phone. I got fed up with listening to the harassment and simply to her mom to “keep nose out our relationship when you don’t even know the situation.” My gf then ended the call and we got into it about her mom constantly harasses me and she never has my back when it come to her, despite me defending her against my mother multiple times. 

Insight would help a lot on this one, thanks folks!

1lztqpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lztqpz/confusing_behaviour/,Confusing behaviour,"I am a 35 year old man and recently ended things with a 34 year old woman) we were dating for 3 months, then she broke it off saying she didn’t have the right feelings for me. I told her that I was sorry to hear that but otherwise accepted it, left and didn’t look back. 

I was hurting a lot during the first couple of days, but then finally started to accept and also see, that maybe we were not good together. She was busy finding her life partner, and was constantly weighing me against her former relationships and judging and criticising many small things, like the fact that I enjoy having a beer or two after work with friends or occasionally going out and get a bit drunk with friends (not excessively and not every weekend). Or the fact that I didn’t want to spend 300 dollars on new shoes because I know I wear them out in a month. 

Two weeks before we split up, she told me that she had doubts and was starting wondering what else was on the dating market. I tried to ignore her comment, but it created uncertainty in me. I hoped it was just a small phase, but after that she acted hot, then cold, texting me she missed me, wanted to see me, then cancelling and rescheduling. So after two weeks of this, I brought it up, and then we ended it. 

2 days later, she sends a practical text about an apartment she found that I might be interested in. I said thanks, but no thanks, because I didn’t want any form of friendly relationship with her.

3 days later, she texts me again asking how I am and that she missed me quite a lot. I replied back, that I had missed her too, but that it was good for me with this time to reflect on things. She then asked if we should go for a coffee one of the following days. I texted her back, that I needed to think a bit about how I’d feel about that (because I wasn’t sure if I was in an emotional state to actually see her without starting to feel the pain from the breakup again).

The following day, and after some good thinking I texted her late afternoon that I’d like to meet, Monday after work and suggested a glass of wine instead of coffee. 6 hours later she replies back (at 23.45) that she would get back to me the following day.

The next day on Sunday at 17.30 she then texts me that she can meet me for a glass of wine on Monday. I then quickly followed up and suggested 19 on Monday at a specific bar.

At 22.30 she then agrees to that and I just reply perfect, see you then.

Monday morning she then writes that she is so sorry, but has to cancel because she has gotten food poisoning and had been puking all night and not slept at all (too many details to sound true) and that she would get back to me when she was feeling better.

I am now feeling like I am in some sort of limbo here; on one hand, I really do like this girl, and I believe that many of our conflicts were based on miscommunications and misunderstandings and a different pace in how to build a healthy and strong relationship. On the other hand, I was starting to lose myself in that relationship because I was walking on glasses to try and avoid feeling judged or criticised. I would like to meet her, but I don’t want to just sit around waiting for her to get back to me. I feel that she is now in a situation where she thinks she can just reach out whenever it pleases her and that I will come jumping back like a little puppy (which I probably would if I didn’t had so much doubt myself).

And now I am left insanely confused. First reaching out saying she miss me and then spending 6 hours replying when I accept the meeting. I was hoping someone here could help me get some perspective here to understand this very strange and very rude behaviour of hers. I would have liked to believe that she is emotionally intelligent enough to understand that that behaviour is hurtful.

1lztq6z,https://v.redd.it/s5sg2df7qvcf1,A Visual Ode to Coffee - From Harvest to Pour,"This video is from my family's farm, Finca de la Niebla Matutina, in the Tarrazú region of Costa Rica. My friend, who is an incredible filmmaker I met during my time at NYU (We're 35 now, time flies), visited in February (end of harvest season) and wanted to capture the *entire* journey. From our harvesting to the final cup. He finally came back with the edited video as he was busy on some other projects.

Seeing this is surreal. The first shot, the pour of the coffee cherries in the wicker basket... my heart. I remember being a kid and dreading harvesting days as we would need to collect what seemed like an infinite amount of baskets of cherries. But as you age and grow alongside the Caturra and Catuaí plants you helped your father plant, you see life in the coffee, life is created with your own hands and processed to give joy to thousands of people everyday.

The sounds you hear – the rustle of the drying beans on the patios during our honey processing, the *chugga-chugga* of the old sewing machine stitching the burlap bags – that is the music of my life's work. My grandfather started on this land in 1963, and the business is just me and a hired hand now. But I hope to one day pass it on to my son who was born late last year. To see our process treated with this much beauty and respect is honestly making me a little emotional.

The final shots, the grinding and the pour-over, that's all my friend's work back home (I sent him home with plenty!). He truly did our beans justice.

Thank you for appreciating the work that goes into every single cup. Happy to answer any questions about the process if anyone has them.

At the same time, I don't want a long-term relationship and don't see any future prospects for it at the moment.

Our agreement was that I could date other women besides the F+, but not other men. (He, in turn, can date other people as long as he tells me.)

There were quite a few ups and downs because at times I wasn't sure if this F+ was good for me. Ultimately, though, I never got away from it.

A few days ago, I met a very attractive man whom I'd like to meet for coffee once or twice. It will probably only be a short-term thing.

If I tell my F+ that, he'll be really angry and won't understand me at all.  But at the same time, I don't want to hide it from him.

Artificial Datum: I-90, Maximilian Gas about 25 mins down the road. Can smell Max’s bad weed from here.

Geological Parallel 1: Hanrah Mountain to the immediate south, foothills to the southwest. Scrubbier than back home. Like scattered groves of juniper. Bug sounds. Good visibility. 

Artificial Parallel 1: No road. No bad weed, either. No lights. Found some standing stones about ten minutes walk from arrival site. Knocked ‘em down for the environment. 
________________________________________

Parallel 2: 

Astronomical Parallel 2: North Star. Cassiopeia with two extras. No Dipper. Brighter than Datum, wisps of green, pink, silver— aurora borealis? Much farther south than it ever is back home. Noticeably cooler, thermo says 82 and I agree. Maybe 11:00 pm PST. 

Geological Parallel 2: No Mount Hanrah to the south, or foothills. Tall grass with split ends. Looks like paintbrushes for miles. In rows. Planted? Smells like salt, reflections to the northeast of me look like water. An ocean. 

Artificial Parallel 2: Lights to the north. Like a city, but low to the ground. Squashed LA. Nothing tall but wide, canyons or hills or mounds, all lit. Can’t see much, but it’s a busy place, saw moving lights in the past ten or so minutes coming from that direction and over the ocean. Fifteenish minute walk down the cliffs and found standing stones. Weird.

Parallel 3: 

Astronomical Parallel 3: Jesus Christ. Galaxy in the sky. Huge arms of stars and gas, bright as or more than a full moon, just filling the sky. Didn’t bother checking constellations. Thermo at 60F. Christ. It’s like the face of God. Are we above or below the ecliptic? Looks like some of it is in rows almost, neat, straight lines— just seeing things? 

Geological Parallel 3: Mount Hanrah to the south. Foothills back again to the southwest. Desert but beyond the mountain and foothills is just flatness, like an island of rock on a mirror. Didn’t notice till I came off the rocks. Ground is a little reflective but dark too. Maybe water all around? Or salt? Smells like ozone, sharp. No bug sounds, but something, a hum, like machinery. 

Artificial Parallel 3: A road, east to west. Came off the rocks to touch and its smooth as glass, colder than the air to the touch. Riveted, but seamless from the ground. The hell do you do that? No potholes. No signs. Is everybody going one way? Who the hell lives here? Standing stones, big ones, the size of VW Beetles a twenty minute walk around the “island”. Fuck that. Still humming.

I wrote another post about four hours ago about messaging a guy on Instagram twice after sleeping with him. I’m 49, he is 32, I projected all of my unhealed shit all over him and I’m just embarrassed. We have a few mutual friends, people who I think are cool, and I was spiraling, thinking that they would think I’m some sort of sad nutcase who deserves to be forever alone.

I know I overreacted and am not ready to date. It’s just boring! I left my ex husband almost nine years ago. We were together 13 years, and after a year of dating, I went into SLAA (sex and love addicts anonymous), worked the steps really hard. Also supporting my two kids through their diagnostic and educational journeys while my ex just walked away seemingly living his best life, repartnering with a woman 21 years younger than him.

Our son is 18 now, and has had his long distance girlfriend of six months staying with me for five nights. They’re so cute, and so in love. It’s weird to be the mum of a semi adult. It’s a lot of masking. My daughter is high support needs, and currently going through a really hard time. I had a really challenging meeting yesterday with the NDIS  (Australian disability system) about getting more support for our beautiful girl. The NDIS kinda sucks, you have to prove in graphic detail “defecits” in order to get supports. It’s challenging and overwhelming and a lot of masking so that she can get the funding she deserves.

Her dad is of the opinion that she is fine and I make her worse, and that I know what to say in appointments to get her diagnosed. He said the same with our son while he was going through his journey. 

I don’t want our kids to have “defecits”, I’m not about their disability but I know I need to state and prove them in order to get them met. It feels hella disloyal. I had a breakdown four years ago due to the stress of it all, Covid lockdowns, my own diagnostic journey in my forties, (adhd at 44 and autism at 42). 

It feels like all I’ve done is heal. Heal and heal and cry and be my best friend and make friendships and be understanding and kind and supportive and listen and not talk badly about my ex, even when he repeatedly refuses to know the kids as they are and want them to mask around him. Our son and his girlfriend went out to dinner with my ex and his partner last night as it was the first time his girlfriend had met his dad and I’m all “oh sounds good! Yay 🎉”. 

Heal heal heal feel feel feel. Be affirming and strong and happy for everyone else while they get to move on and be in love and I’ll just keep on doing the stuff and making the calls and the healing and supporting.  BORING BORING BLOODY BORING!!!

I want to do this, I chose to get better and come back and I don’t want my kids to feel like they owe me anything. I want to reiterate to myself that I chose this life and that I honour my choices and support myself and heal myself and see friends and do coffee and have massages and talk therapy and practice self love and light a candle and eat carrots and do my physiotherapy exercises for my sore knee.

I’m in my healing era- but I feel like it’s lasted forever. I know that I am not ready to date. But I just miss sex and intimacy and being with a man. And I wish it wasn’t so fucking boring sometimes. I don’t want to sound like a victim. But it’s just fucking tedious. And I try to do fun stuff but sometimes I just want to touch a penis!!

Being that I’m a professor now, I’ve gotten into the habit of waking up extremely early. Usually, I wake up just as the sun is going up. And even being held hostage in my childhood freakshow hasn’t stopped my body from still wanting to wake up early. I’d walked around the entire perimeter of the Freakshow, but couldn’t find a single hole in the fence. All I ended up seeing was plenty of sizzling and decomposing bodies. Eventually, I returned to my room and managed to fall asleep. Pulling myself out of bed, I looked over to the clown outfit I had taken off and left on the floor when I collapsed into bed. 



I knew that Garibaldi was doing this to get a rise out of me. I looked over at the closet that was in my room and groggily walked over to it in my underwear. Opening the closet, I raised my brow at what I was presented with. The entire left side of my closet was filled with identical clown outfits to the one I had been forced to wear. The other half was filled with the exact same outfit I had been wearing when they had kidnapped me. 



“Do they think I’m a cartoon character?” I mumbled groggily, suddenly remembering that I hadn’t had a smoke since the moment I was brought here. I could feel the effects of withdrawal starting to hit me, and already I was in desperate need of a smoke. Suddenly, there was a knock on my door. I looked over to it and sighed. Looking back at the closet, I didn’t feel like fighting to put my jeans on, so I elected to quickly put on a pair of clown pants. I at least wanted to be wearing pants to greet whatever had knocked on my door. Having gotten them on, I walked over to my door and opened it, finding that it was unlocked.



Victor greeted me with a smile and a wave. I couldn’t help but be annoyed by his presence. He followed me around everywhere it seemed. “What do you want?” I asked him, standing shirtless before him. Victor stared at my chest for a moment before looking back up at me. My question seemed to have caught him off guard as he stared at me for a few more seconds, seemingly trying to remember why he was even here. 



“N…ee…d t…o teke ta…” He tried to speak to me, but the only thing coming out of his mouth was a jumbled mess of sounds and words on occasion. I watched Victor struggle for a moment before I slammed the door in his face. If he was going to struggle so badly just to form a sentence, I wasn’t going to stand out there half-naked before him. I walked back over to my closet and reached over to grab my t-shirt and button-up. Since I felt like crap, I was going to dress like crap, wearing the clown pants as a sort of sweatpants while keeping my normal clothes on top. 



Just as I walked to the mirror, trying to get my hair into some sort of order, Victor again began knocking on my door. I groaned, rubbing my eyes as I debated just leaving him to knock on my door for eternity. But my lack of nicotine got the better of me, since the constant knocking began to drill into my brain. I walked over to the door and threw it open again. Victor was still standing there, but this time he had produced a note for me. He was smiling proudly as he handed it to me. I snatched it from him and looked down at it. 



“Office! :D” It said in some of the worst handwriting I had ever seen in my entire life. I’m a professor, so I’ve seen my fair share of badly written essays. But even a kindergartner would be ashamed if his handwriting looked as bad as Victor’s did. It took me a moment to even figure out what it said, before finally figuring it out. 



“He wants to see me?” I asked Victor as I looked up at him and handed his note back to him. Victor nodded and peeked into my room to try and see if I was doing anything. I simply shoved past him and started making my way down the hallway. I turned back for a moment to see Victor following after me like a puppy. I needed a cigarette sooner rather than later. 



“What the hell are you wearing?” Garibaldi asked me as I entered his office. I shrugged at him. I didn’t feel the need to explain myself, and that clearly pissed him off. He let out a few hisses of anger at me. This clearly wasn’t the same Garibaldi I had known in my childhood. That one had at least pretended to be funny and cheerful towards me. This one had none of that left, but I suppose I was the one to cause that. 



“So, what do you want me to do here?” I asked him, looking around his office for a moment to see if there was anything here that might help me escape. I didn’t have long to think as Garibaldi leaned back in his chair and wheezed slightly. He stared into my soul with his multicolored eyes for a moment. 



“I haven’t decided yet. I still need time to think.” He sat up in his chair and began to stand up, gripping his cane tightly as he began to push up off his chair. Victor was next to him to aid in the process. “In the meantime, you’re on carny duty tonight. We have a show tonight, and you still need to acclimate to the new layout.” He clicked his mandibles at me as he walked around his desk, his cane tapping on the floor in rhythmic taps. 



“Carny duty?” I asked quizically. To think all that college education just to end up being a carny at the Freakshow that ruined my life. Garibaldi nodded and walked over to a wardrobe on the far side of his office. He clicked a few times as he rummaged through it, finally finding the article he was looking for and handing it to Victor. The mismatched puppet held up the outfit, and I instantly cringed as I looked at it. 



“You’ve got to be kidding me. The clown outfit wasn’t humiliating enough?” I asked in exasperation as I stared at the outfit. Big giant pants held up with suspenders, a giant bow tie, and a stupid hat. “You decided to embarrass me to death instead of just eating me?” I sighed. As I did, Garibaldi flapped his wings at me and hissed loudly. 



“I’m not going to warn you again about that sass of yours. Run your mouth again, and I might just take you up on that offer.” He hissed, his body trembling and cracking in places. Victor looked over at him, dropped my outfit, and quickly ran over to Garibaldi, gently patting him on the head to calm him down. “Get out of my sight.” He ordered me. 



I stared back at him before walking over to the dropped outfit and picking it up, and wordlessly leaving the office. I brought the outfit back to my room and stared at it. I noticed that it even came with a nametag on the plain white shirt that came with it. ‘Benny Boy’. I rolled my eyes and sighed as hard as I possibly could. Maybe I should’ve just let him eat me. Then I thought back to Chloe. I couldn’t let another little kid go through what I did. So, I swallowed what little pride I had left and changed into the outfit. I even tied my long hair into a ponytail so I could wear the hat. 



Exiting out of the big top and out onto the grounds, I again began to walk around to better memorize the layout of the entire Freakshow. As I did so, I noticed an intricately designed building. It had carvings into the wood that made it seem exotic and just a little out of place in the Freakshow. I looked around to ensure no one was watching me and entered the building. I was surprised to see that inside the building was an enormous water tank. The entire inside was lit by bright red lights, which succeeded in amplifying my anxiety in there. 



I walked up to the water tank and stared into the red water. Against my better judgment, I tapped on the glass to see if anything showed up. I waited a moment before tapping again. As I did so, something slammed against the tank as hard as possible. I flinched back a whole foot and stood there panting uncontrollably. 



“Oh! I’m so sorry, sweetheart. I didn’t mean to frighten you.” A voice suddenly filled my head. It was as if the voice was coming from inside my brain. I looked over at the figure that slammed against the glass, and I saw that it was a mermaid. For a brief second, I thought that she was one of those divers who wear a fake tail and swim around in fish tanks, but as I stepped back closer to the tank, I saw that this was a real mermaid. Her long hands were webbed, and she even had fish-like ears. She swam elegantly around the tank before stopping in front of me, smiling with her mouth closed. 



“Who…are you?” I asked her, placing my hand on the tank and pressing my face against the glass to look at her. She swished her long flowing hair underwater before starting to do more laps in the giant tank. 



“My name is Melite.” Her voice again filled my head. She had some sort of telepathy and was able to communicate with me underwater. “What do I call you?” She asked me, stopping again in front of me and floating there. 



“Oh, I’m Benjamin. You can call me Ben.” I told her, completely mesmerized by her elegant swimming and the sweet, beautiful voice in my head. She smiled at me again before starting to swim again, building up speed before she breached the top of the open tank and leaped into the air like a dolphin, before falling back into the water. 



“Will you help me, Ben? All they ever feed me here is disgusting rotting fish.” She told me, her sweet voice tinged with sadness. “Could you come here tonight? With some new kind of food? I would so love to try some of the food you humans have here.” She asked me, swimming over to me again and placing her webbed hand against the glass tank. I looked at her and placed my hand on the other side of the tank. 



“Um, sure, I guess.” I was a pretty smooth talker. She nodded at me and began to swim around again in excitement. I smiled at the tank, finally pulling myself away and exiting the building. Making a mental note to come back with food later that night. As I made my way around the camp, my nose suddenly picked up the familiar, disgusting smell of a cigarette. I quickly followed the smell right behind the gift shop, catching a short man smoking one. 



“Hey, can I get one of those?” I asked him, quickly approaching him. He looked at me with wide eyes, and I couldn’t help but freeze in place when I laid eyes on him. I appeared to be looking at some sort of human-goat hybrid. He had the long horns and ears of a goat and the legs to match, but the rest of his body was plainly human. He looked just as shocked to see me as he quickly crushed the cigarette beneath his hoof. 



“Please don’t tell Antonio! I-I just had to see something burn! I-I had to!” He had a soft voice, and he seemed to be upset with my having seen him doing something he wasn’t supposed to be doing. It felt like being a parent and catching your child smoking. 



“Hey, it’s okay! I’m not going to tell him shit.” I told him, slowly approaching and desperate to have a cigarette from this guy. “We haven’t met yet, I’m Ben.” I offered him my hand. He looked up at me nervously before gently taking my hand and shaking it. I noticed a giant, long burn scar across his entire arm. And my mind immediately thought back to Nikolai and all the scars that he had. 



“I’m Vergil,” he said in that same shy, soft voice. He looked around again, gently flapping his ears for a moment before reaching into his ripped jeans pockets and pulling out a crumpled up pack of cigarettes. He pulled one out for me, and I quickly thanked him. I placed it in my mouth and looked at him, silently asking him for a lighter. He began to look around again before pointing his finger up at me. I stared at him for a moment, before suddenly a small orange flame sprouted from his finger and lit my cigarette. 



“Damn, you can control fire?” I asked him, impressed and enjoying the smoke filling my lungs. Vergil rubbed his arm and nodded as he looked down at the floor. I did my best to be respectful and not look at him too much. I could tell that he most likely had trouble with new people, so I just lay my back against the wooden wall of a nearby booth and smoked my newly acquired cigarette. 



“I’m not allowed to use fire outside of my performances. Antonio doesn’t like it,” Vergil said after a moment of prolonged silence. “He’s got a fear of fire now. But if I don’t burn things for a while, I get…” He trailed off and continued to rub his arm. I stared at the burnt arm he had and saw that along with the burn, he had a large red tattoo on his arm. A double headed dragon. 



“Don’t worry. As long as I can steal a smoke from you every now and again, your secret is safe with me.” I smiled at him. Vergil looked at me and also smiled, rubbing the back of his head, and excusing himself. He walked off, and I saw how awkward he was walking on those goat legs. I couldn’t judge him too much, I doubt I would be much better. I stayed in Vergil’s hiding spot for a few more minutes to enjoy the whole cigarette before leaving to continue my tour. 



As I left, though, I bumped into someone. “Oh, sorry. I didn’t see you there.” I told them, looking down at how I had run into. My heart stopped the moment I saw those loving eyes looking back up at me. She was a lot older now, and she no longer wore her circus outfit. Her hair was fully gray now, and she looked every bit the old grandmother from a story book. But I knew who she was instantly, and she knew who I was. 



“Benny…oh my sweet baby boy!” Abigail practically screamed when she adjusted her glasses to get a better look at me. She wrapped her arms around me and squeezed me into a soft and warm hug. I couldn’t help but start crying as I hugged her back, squeezing her as tightly as I could. “Oh my sweet boy, look at how you’ve grown!” She told me, finally managing to pull away and get a good look at me. “Look at how handsome you are!” She was positively giddy with excitement, and tears filled her eyes as well. 



“I never thought I’d see you again.” I whimpered at her before we both hugged again. She pulled me along to her tent, and I saw that she now ran a small bakery in the Freakshow. She sat me down in moments and began to make me a big breakfast, ignoring my feeble protests and serving me a stack of pancakes and coffee. 



“A professor?! Oh, Benny, I’m so proud of you!” She smiled as she sat down across from me as I started eating the giant breakfast she’d made for me. I couldn’t help but blush a little as she gushed about how proud she was and how happy she was to see me again. And I would’ve been lying if I had tried to play down just how happy I was to see her again. 



“So you’re retired from the Freakshow? I didn’t think you get to retire.” I asked, eating some of the pancakes. It made sense, given how old she now looked and acted. Her days of tightrope walking and balancing things were long behind her. 



“Well, someone still has to feed all the people here.” She shrugged with a smile, watching me as I ate the food she’d prepared for me. We caught up on nearly everything that had happened. I told her about my own mother’s struggle with addiction and how I was struggling to forgive her for everything. And my feelings of guilt over Santiago and Nikolai. 



“You can’t feel that way, sweetie pie.” She told me, placing her hand on mine. “Those things happened. Whether they’re your fault or not is irrelevant. They happened. And it’s our job to move on and continue our lives. I know that Santiago and Nikolai would be immensely proud of the life that you built for yourself.” She smiled, tears in her eyes. I smiled back at her and placed my other hand on top of hers. 



“There is something else that’s bothering me. Chloe. I can’t have what happened to me happen to her.” I told her. At that mention, I could tell that Abigail was uncomfortable with the subject. 



“I know how you feel, Benny. But…” She trailed off, looking around her as if Garibaldi would suddenly appear before us. “Just make sure you stay safe. I can’t lose another son.” She reached out and touched my cheek, running her thumb across the scar on my face. I nodded and gave her one last hug before leaving her tent. I knew I couldn’t rely on her for my plans. But it was nice to know that she was still here and still the same. 



As I wandered around the Freakshow and began to get the hang of its nonsensical layout, I was passing by the controls to one of the roller coasters when an arm reached out and yanked me behind them. I was about to turn around and throw a punch at the person who had grabbed me when I laid eyes on what I at first mistook for Victor. But this was a woman, made up of seemingly several women's body parts. But as I stared at the head for a moment, and the mask that covered the top of her face, I was suddenly stricken with remembrance.



“Starla…?” I asked the person. She looked at me for a moment, a look of confusion on her face, before a small smile spread across her lips and she nodded carefully. Mathieu’s assistant was almost unrecognizable to me. She’d been broken and fixed up even more times than when I had last seen her all those years ago. When I had left, she’d been unable to speak. Now it seemed like she was barely able to function at all. 



“I’m so sorry, Starla. Is there even any of you left in there?” I asked her, devastated to see her in such a state. Her body jankily moved closer to me, and I couldn’t help but take a step back. But she continued and gently flopped her arms on my shoulder. For the briefest of moments, I thought she was going to kiss me, but she simply held my gaze. I saw in her eyes a cry for help. And, a small sparkle of hope. 



“I promise, I’ll put an end to all of this,” I told her. She smiled again and nodded gently. She let go of me and began to hobble away. It was an awful sight. At least with Victor, there was a separation. Victor hardly resembled a real person at times. He seemed like a doll brought to life. Starla had been fully human before. And now this was all she was reduced to. It just motivated me more to put a stop to Garibaldi and the Freakshow as a whole. 



Finally, as the sun began to set, I made my way to the booth that I’d been assigned to later by Victor. It was the game where you throw darts at the balloons. Simply enough, but as I started setting things up, I noticed that I was not going to have enough time to set everything up. 



“Need some help?” A woman asked me. I turned my head to see who it was, and saw an unfamiliar person standing before my booth. She was dressed in a leotard, with large bat-like wings tied to her arms. The strangest thing about her, though, was the cage that she was wearing around her head. It was a gilded bird cage, and she seemed perfectly content with it around her head. 



“Uh…if you wouldn’t mind?” I told her, looking at all the balloons and prizes I still had to hang up. She quickly nodded, her large ears that were tied to her head bobbed up and down as she did so. She quickly helped set up the balloons while I made sure to make the stuffed animals and other prizes look appealing to whoever was going to show up. 



“So, what’s a cutie like you doing here? I haven’t seen you before. I’m Brownwyn,” she said with a smile, placing more balloons at the targets for the darts. I was busy thinking and didn’t hear her at first. Finally realizing that she was talking to me, I looked over at her.



“Oh, I’m Benjamin. You can call me Ben. And uh…it’s a long story about how I got here.” I sighed as I placed the last few stuffed animals into place. 



“Well, I wouldn’t mind hearing a long story from you.” She told me, still smiling and walking closer to me. I looked at her, confused. Did she really need to know things about me? Just then, the searchlights turned on and began to point towards the big top. “Oh! I'd better get going! You should come see my act!” She waved goodbye as she left my booth. I waved goodbye at her, and winced as I noticed that sticking out of the back of her head was the mouth of what looked to be a giant bat. 



I was amazed at how busy the Freakshow quickly became. It seemed there were lines everywhere. People were screaming and cheering for joy, all the while they had no idea about the monster that ran this place. I was fortunate enough that nobody seemed too interested in the depressed looking carny running the booth to try my game. So I used this free time to begin thinking about ways of escape. I watched the roller coaster, thinking that maybe there could be some way to use it to jump over the fence. 



“Excuse me?” A soft voice asked, pulling me out of my thoughts. I shook my head and quickly looked around to find its source. It took me a moment to look over the booth to see that Chloe was standing before me with a couple of unmade balloon animals in her arms. “Can I play?” She asked, pointing at the wall of toys. 



“Oh! Uh…yeah! You work here, so you should be able to do it for free.” I told her, suddenly completely out of my element. I had never really interacted with children of Chloe’s age. So I handed her the three darts she would usually get if she paid for the game. I watched her throw them and immediately felt bad for her. She threw them too weakly and too inaccurately. I could tell how upset she was at failing, so I simply walked over to the wall of prizes and gave her a teddy bear. 



“Thank you so much!” She shouted in excitement. I smiled at how excited she became, hugging her bear and stroking its head gently. I invited her to stay in the booth if she was tired of walking around the Freakshow and asking to make balloon animals for strangers.  



“So, do you, uh, have any parents?” I asked her as she sat with her bear in her lap and began to fiddle with her balloons. She looked at me for a moment before sadly looking down at her balloons and shaking her head. I mentally slapped myself for asking her that. “Uh…how’d you get so good at balloon animals?” I asked her, quickly changing the subject. 



“I’ve always been good at it!” she said excitedly, sticking her tongue out in focus as she put the finishing touches to the one she was making. When she was finished, she triumphantly presented it to me. I stared at it and took it from her, staring at the red eyed bird that she’d given me. 



“This is really good!” I told her with a smile, just a little creeped out by it, but not wanting to hurt her feelings again. We continued to talk to each other, even playing 20 questions with each other. And while I told her a few bits of information about myself to get her to open up, she didn’t open up much about herself. We were so caught up in talking with each other that we didn’t realize that the guests had all begun to leave the Freakshow for the night. 



“Cmon, I’ll walk you to your tent.” I smiled, picking her up gently and walking with her to where she pointed her tent was. She yawned, clearly exhausted from her day. I offered to come inside and help her into bed, but she said that she could handle it. 



“Thank you, Mr. Benny!” She waved goodbye to me as she turned to enter her small tent. I waved goodbye to her and noticed just how dark it was getting. I then remembered what Melite had told me. I quickly began searching for something that she would want to eat. Lucky for me, some people do just throw anything away. In searching the garbage cans, I discovered an uneaten corn dog and a caramel apple. Considering she apparently ate rotten fish, I was sure that she’d enjoy this much better. Even if it had come from the trash. 



I made my way back to Melite’s building and found that inside the red light was turned off, replaced instead with a simple white light. With the red light cut off, I could see that Melite was the real deal. Her skin was a beautiful shade of blue. She turned to look at me and waved happily. 



“You came!” She told me from inside my head. I nodded to her and walked closer to the tank. She pointed to the top of her tank and saw that next to it was a scaffold that would allow me to get to the top of her tank. I nodded and started climbing up it, finally reaching it and leaning over the tank. She peered at me from the water before swimming up and poking her upper body through the surface. 



“Thank you so much, sweetie! Could you lean in closer? I can’t reach it.’’ She reached her arms out toward me. I nodded and leaned in closer with the food for her. I watched as she smiled, revealing her rows of sharp teeth, and to my horror, her eyes turned pitch black. She reached out and grabbed me by the arm, yanking me in as hard as she could. I let out a scream as I was pulled in, but quickly my mouth and my lungs began to fill with water. 



“You have no idea, just how long I’ve waited for this.” Melite’s sweet voice told me, as she wrapped her body around me and began to squeeze me with her tail. I sucked in more water, begging for air and screaming, but all that happened was that more water filled my lungs. I tried to get her off of me, but she squeezed her body tightly around me, and forced out all the remaining air I still had in my body. I watched as my vision began to darken, that she had opened her mouth and was about to bite into my neck. 



Just as I had lost all the strength in my body, I suddenly felt Melite let me go. Suddenly, an arm grabbed me by the collar and yanked me out of the water. I vomited a whole gallon's worth of water out of my body when I hit the surface of the scaffold. I coughed and hacked, throwing up some more. In the scuffle, I’d lost my glasses, so I looked up blindly at who it had been that saved me. Gently, something placed my glasses back on, and to my immense surprise, it was Victor who had saved me. He patted me on the back to get all of the water out of my system, and in his other arm was a long cattle prod. 



“You bitch! I was about to eat!” Melite screamed from the water. But this time in her true voice. A hoarse, garbled mess that barely resembled a voice at all. I hacked some more before Victor suddenly threw a towel over me and led me down the scaffold. Melite continued to throw a tantrum in the water, banging her hand against the tank walls and demanding that Victor bring me back to her. 



The next thing I knew, I was sitting back in Garibaldi’s office. Staring at the mantis man as Victor served us coffee. I was still dripping wet and had left a trail the whole walk to Garibaldi’s office, but he didn’t seem to mind. 



“Cream or sugar?” he asked me as Victor served the coffee to the two of us. I pointed at the sugar, and Victor dutifully put two lumps of sugar into the coffee for me. “We used to have a sign on her tank that warned against listening to her. She promised that she wouldn’t try this again.” Garibaldi sighed as he rubbed his eyes with his long, colored fingers. 



“You sent him to spy on me?” I asked after I took a small sip of the coffee, reaching out and adding more sugar cubes to it. Garibaldi looked at me like I was an idiot before reaching out and drinking his coffee black. 



“Obviously. I can’t even trust you not to fall into a fish tank.” He scoffed, swigging the whole cup of coffee in one motion. I watched him as I nursed my own cup. If Victor hadn’t been watching me, I’d have been dead. “You’ll be glad to know that I finally have an act for you,” Garibaldi said as he handed his empty cup to Victor. 



“Yeah? What is it? Living dart board?” I asked, quickly sipping my coffee to avoid his gaze. 



“Beast gladiator,” he said with a purr, his mandibles clicking together. At the mention of my new role, I spat my coffee out. 



I was doomed.

1lztn91,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1lztn91/stopping_scrolling_my_phone_first_in_the_morning/,Stopping scrolling my phone first in the morning is harder than quitting caffeine was,"I’m in my 3rd week of not checking my phone immediately after waking up. Sounds simple, but it’s incredibly hard to do.

I used to grab my phone before I was even fully awake. Checking messages, scrolling through the news, scrolling through the notifications that piled up overnight. By the time I woke up, I’d already received thirty different messages and my mind was a mess.

Now I try to think seriously in the morning instead of surfing the internet right away. At first… it was a little uncomfortable. One way to help is to keep my phone in the kitchen instead of by my bed. This forces me to make a conscious choice to check my phone when I get up. Usually by then I’ve already started drinking coffee or brushing my teeth, so when I finally do check my phone, I’m more alert.

The change is subtle, but real. I feel more focused in my morning routine. Less sensitive to the little things that don’t matter. My mind feels calmer before I start the day.

The hardest part is the fear of missing out (FOMO). What if something important happens in the evening? What if someone needs me? But to be honest, in the past three weeks, I haven’t had a real emergency that had to wait until after breakfast.

It made me realize that my habit of checking my phone was largely a nervous habit rather than a real need for information.

I’m just putting this out into the universe hoping to meet someone fun to chat with. I’m a guy who loves binge watching movies but I’m also the kind of person who likes to get outside and see where the day takes me whether it’s grabbing a coffee exploring new spots.

If you’re looking for some good conversation a few laughs or maybe even a little friendly banter send me a message. No pressure just curious to see who’s out there and maybe make a new connection.

So what about you? What’s your go to way to spend a lazy day? Drop me a DM and let’s swap stories.

I’m expressive, intuitive, and a lover of conversations that go beyond small talk. I like when someone can challenge me without turning everything into a debate. INFJ for those who like to know. I can be shy with the people I meet for the first time that is why I find dating via online platforms much more easier. But I am pretty outgoing and bubbly once I am confortable with the person.

My free time usually involves a mix of hiking, city escapes, going to the movies, and hands-on workshops (ceramics and crafts are my thing lately). I have a small obsession with perfumes, cute coffee shops, and the smell of books — all the cozy, layered details that make life feel felt, you know?

About my physical appearance (since that matters): I am the petite type (157cm for 58kg). Dark brown eyes/long curly black hair and overall light skin, conventionally pretty. I am fit and generally like to take care of how I look. I don’t mind sharing few pics when I feel like a little bit of rapport and trust is built.

What I am looking for: Character: Emotional intelligence, initiative, and a sense of humor that doesn’t try too hard. Someone who plans with intention and isn’t afraid to be curious about the person in front of them. I love it when a guy knows how to show interest and be romantic, kind, and gentle.

Physical appearance: Ideally, someone who is around 179 and 186cm, not necessarily a gym rat but who is within a healthy weight range and has a healthy relationship with food and exercising. (I am not a fan of big bellies, very long hair or baldness sorry). Someone clean and who loves to dress in a smart casual way.

Education: Someone who is educated preferably a minimal undergraduate degree (I hold a Masters degree) and a full time job that excites you. I love nerds and seem to get along pretty well with engineers when they happen to be super articulate and good with words.

Age range: 29 to 40 yo.

Where in the world: I am based in Belgium but am open to any other place in Europe as long as actual plans to meet are within your reach and doable.

Languages: French and English. Feel free to hit me up with an introduction of yourself if you feel like talking 😊",1,1752516087.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False
1lztle8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1lztle8/how_does_the_breville_smart_kettle_luxe_transform/,How Does the Breville Smart Kettle Luxe Transform Your Tea and Coffee Routine?,"The Breville BKE845BSS1BUS1, also known as the Smart Kettle Luxe, has been a regular companion on my kitchen counter for weeks now. Designed for discerning tea and coffee enthusiasts, its sleek brushed stainless steel finish immediately caught my eye. But beyond its good looks, this kettle packs an array of features that make brewing hot drinks an elevated experience. I tried everything this kettle had to offer, and while I’m generally impressed, there were a few things that stood out, both positively and negatively.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me about this kettle was its premium feel. The brushed stainless steel exterior looks modern and complements other appliances in the kitchen perfectly. It’s not just about aesthetics, though; the kettle feels solid and well-built. The hinged lid opens smoothly and is designed with soft-top functionality to prevent hot steam from escaping too aggressively. This feature is a lifesaver for someone like me who has been on the receiving end of unpredictable hot water splashes before. At 3.86 pounds, it’s not lightweight, but this adds to its overall sturdy feel rather than being a downside. The compact dimensions mean it doesn’t take up excessive counter space, though its height might make storage in smaller cabinets tricky. 

**Capacity and Temperature Settings**  
The kettle boasts a 7-cup capacity, which is perfect for tea-laden gatherings or coffee prep for a group. Its standout feature, however, is the five preset temperature settings tailored for different types of tea and coffee—black, green, white, oolong, and French press. I tested each setting, brewing my green tea and black coffee precisely at the advised temperatures, and the difference in taste was noticeable. The one-touch functionality makes it incredibly user-friendly, even for those who aren’t tech-savvy.

[Check Breville BKE845BSS1BUS1 price on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b07t23dyjb/)

**Cordless Convenience**  
If you’ve never had a cordless kettle, let me tell you, it’s a game changer. This one is even better with its 360-degree multi-directional base that allows you to place the kettle in any orientation. I appreciated the cord storage wrap, though I barely use it since the appliance practically lives on my countertop. Carrying it across the kitchen to pour without the hassle of a dangling cord felt extremely convenient.

**Good Points**  
- Precise brewing temperatures for tea and coffee lovers  
- The ""Keep Warm"" feature holds water at the ideal temperature for 20 minutes   
- Soft-opening lid reduces splash risks when handling boiling water  
- Durable and stylish stainless steel design  
- Cordless functionality with a stable, multi-directional base  

**Downsides**  
- The kettle’s weight might be a bit much for some users  
- Cleaning requires effort due to the stainless steel showing streaks easily  
- Storage could be challenging in smaller spaces  

**Keep Warm Feature and Usability**  
One of my favorite aspects is the Keep Warm button. I tend to get distracted, so having my water stay at the desired temperature for 20 minutes saves me from repeated trips to the kettle. Its ease of use is also worth highlighting. The buttons are intuitive, and there’s no complicated setup involved—just plug it in, press the desired setting, and watch the magic happen.

**Competing Products**  
When I compared it with other popular models like the Cuisinart PerfecTemp and Fellow Stagg EKG, it became clear that the Breville Smart Kettle Luxe holds its own in more ways than one. The Fellow Stagg EKG is a contender for its sleek design and variable temperature control, but it’s significantly more expensive and sacrifices capacity. Meanwhile, the Cuisinart PerfecTemp offers similar temperature presets at a slightly lower price point but lacks the same polished build and convenience features like the Keep Warm button and hinged lid. Ultimately, while the Breville stands as a middle ground between the two, its aesthetics and user-friendly design give it an edge over competitors.

**Value Proposition**  
In terms of price to quality ratio, this kettle strikes a satisfying balance. While it leans slightly towards the premium side, its feature set justifies it. The variety of preset temperatures and the soft-opening lid make it stand out, ensuring you’re paying for utility, not just looks. For coffee and tea aficionados, I’d say it’s worth the investment if you’re upgrading from a standard electric kettle. If you’re simply boiling water with no concern for precise temperatures, you might not find the extra features valuable enough to justify the cost.

1lztlcf,https://i.redd.it/v4rcwn41qvcf1.png,FINALLY getting to review some fall stuff ✨️,"I used my last 3 rewards today because yes I'm impatient and didn't wanna wait for a sale

It's so cool getting to review stuff after everyone and their mother has already gotten a chance to sell it. Can't believe how early some people were getting stuff 😭 but I still wanna give my thoughts on these scents because, idk, maybe one day BBW will partner with me (I'm joking, that's never gonna happen)

The scents I passed on were Book Loft and Glazed Pumpkin. I need to spend some more time with it but Glazed Pumpkin didn't impress me all that much, and Book Loft is good I just don't need it like, right now

I was really excited for the coffee stuff. I've been asking for a coffee line for a while now and it's like they answered my prayers

Rich Espresso is really decadent. It's not really a coffee ground scent but rather it's the aroma of brewed coffee with warm undertones. The wellness mists are usually pretty potent so I'm excited to try it properly (rn it's just on my wrist).

Vanilla Cafe is the true winner of the bunch. It's super sweet, cozy, and smells like coffee with creamer added. After almost an hour of it being on the crook of my arm I can still smell it. It's not Midnight Amber Glow but it does smell super good.

I'd say if you want a coffee scent, the true coffee smell is Rich Espresso and the gourmand coffee is Vanilla Cafe.

Vanilla Ease I initially had mixed feelings with because it sounded like a Lavender Vanilla repackage. It does smell like that on the first spray but it does dry down to a more warm floral scent with those sweet undertones which does make it unique. It is light though and faded on my wrist easily though, so I will need to apply extra.

Every time I wanna take a break BBW offers more newness that I love. So far 2025 has been the year of getting everything I want. I wanted Sweet Carrot Cake in body care, boom, it released. I wanted a blue raspberry spray, boom, Blue Raspberry Burst. I wanted a soda scent, boom, I Scream Float. I almost can't believe it haha.",12,1752516073.0,bathandbodyworks,0,1.0,False

1lzthob,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lzthob/aita_for_confiscating_a_friends_dental_floss/,AITA for confiscating a friend's dental floss?,"I had a friend come visit from out of town for a long weekend. We've been friend over 20 years,  and I was excited to see her.

She's had cats in the past, but married someone who is highly allergic to almost anything with fur, so she hasn't had any furred pets in many years (she has some reptiles). I have nurmerous cats, and she was also excited to get a weekend of kitties.

However, it became clear very quickly that she doesn't live with cats. Leaving food unattended, putting cups on the edge of the coffee table/counter, etc, made it a very messy weekend. But whatever, right?

Then there was the dental floss.

For context here, one of my cats ate a string he pulled out of a rug several months ago, and I paid THOUSANDS to save him. Like, he should have died - not only was it a very long string, but he had numerous post-op complications. But he is my baby, and it was money well spent to me. My cat learned exactly nothing from the experience - he still LOVES string and hair ties, and I am hypervigilant about such things being left out where he can access them.

I told my friend she CANNOT throw dental floss in the bathroom trash - it has to go in the kitchen trash. The bathroom trash had a lid, but this cat is very smart and very determined. And in the event the lid doesn't get closed, it's essentially leaving string right at cat-height.

Well, she didn't get the (very direct, not even a hint) hint. I kept finding floss in the bathroom trash, and twice I found it just laying on the counter, waiting to be swallowed. The first couple times, I tried to gently remind her. Then I directly told her again. When I found floss, yet again, just laying on the counter, I told her she needed to hand over her floss. I have the little floss picks she can use, but I cannot have long strings just being left around the house willy nilly. I cannot afford to have another major emergency vet surgery. I was not rude about it, and I did not yell or anything, but it was just too big a risk to keep allowing her to leave it lying about. 

She complied, but after she went home her husband called me and said I was being totally put of line and treating her like a child, and that I should be more concerned with teaching my cat not to eat string. I do sort of see his point, but the reality is I tried to remind her not to do it, and it wasn't sticking. It's literally  a safety issue in my home - one that could mean life or death. If she couldn't manage to dispose of floss in the kitchen, then my only choice to protect my dumb ass cat is to remove the dangerous item. There is no ""teaching"" a cat to not use their insticts, and hunting/eating things is instinct.

AITA here? I feel like no, but the way her husband acted, I'm now not totally sure.

(And yes, I gave her floss back before she left. I'm not a floss thief)",3,1752515858.0,AmItheAsshole,10,0.8,False

QUERY

Dear \[Agent Name\],

In the summer of 1971, estranged brothers Joaquim and Fèlix Valentin set off across the deserts of the American Southwest in search of a burial site—for Fèlix. He’s breathing fine. He’s just completely convinced that he’s dead.

Since their mother’s recent suicide, Fèlix has slipped into near-catatonia. The only thing that moves him is the promise of being laid to rest. Joaquim, his reluctant caretaker, proposed the road trip as a desperate gambit to reconnect and heal. But he’s completely out of his depth, battling exhaustion with gas station coffees while hiding his own grief behind a fraying veil of big-brother bravado.

Then Sunny Anderson hitches a ride. A recent graduate and brazen opportunist, she sees in Fèlix a fascinating psychological case study—and her ticket to grad school. She and Joaquim form a wary alliance, their clashing approaches tempered by a slow-burning attraction. As the trio trace the crumbling vestiges of Route 66, they unearth the roots of Fèlix’s delusion: the martyrish ideals of exiled Catalan parents, the long shadow of Franco’s regime, and Joaquim’s flight from home at sixteen—an act of abandonment he won’t admit and Fèlix won’t forgive.

As Fèlix inches toward life, and Sunny’s opportunism softens into affection, a fragile future materializes on Joaquim’s horizon—just as a threat from his past appears in the rear-view mirror. Someone from his time in Vegas is following them. Someone he owes. Worse, Fèlix becomes convinced that this pursuer is an angel of punishment, ready to damn him to hellfire. As all of Joaquim’s progress threatens to burn to ashes, he’ll have to reckon with the fact that some debts are too alive to bury—and, for all the shit he gives his brother, he just might end up digging his own grave in the process.

Complete at 93,000 words, ROADKILL ELEGY is an upmarket road novel with elements of psychological suspense. It blends the surreal, grief-soaked Southwestern landscape of Melissa Broder’s Death Valley with the semi-absurd road tripping of Amor Towles’ The Lincoln Highway.

I am a California-based designer with degrees in cognitive science and psychology, which inform my fiction’s focus on the mind, memory, and meaning-making. In addition to writing, I enjoy studying art history, playing piano, and taking on absurd personal challenges—this year’s is reverse St. Patrick’s Day: wearing green every day except the holiday. This would be my debut novel.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Warmly,

Joaquim kicked up a flurry of rust-colored silt, then watched it settle like ash. His lips, thinned into a scowl, tasted faintly of seasalt; sweat slicked his hands where they gripped the shovel. “So? You think this is the spot?”

Prophet-like, Fèlix scanned the desolate landscape as if the truth of the place might shimmer into focus—something it was never so kind as to do for Joaquim. He then looked to the orange-hot sun setting over the hills, as if asking its approval. Nodded. “I think so.”

“You don’t sound very sure,” Joaquim muttered, checking his military surplus boots for a pebble that had been jostling around. He became so preoccupied with his search that only after a few failed attempts at dislodgement did he realize he’d acquired an audience: his younger brother had been transfixed by the Sisyphean struggle. “So go on,” Joaquim said, gesturing with the hand not holding his shoe. “We don’t have all day. Have a lie down, see how it feels.”

“Don’t rush me,” Fèlix huffed. Nevertheless, he lowered himself until he was flat on his back, saying nothing of the dirt packing into the creases of his oversized brown leather jacket—Joaquim’s, actually, not that he seemed altogether concerned about the borrowed goods. Once settled, he closed his eyes; inhaled.

The colors of dusk scattered across tan skin and dark, troubled brows; the rest of his expression maintained its usual delicate character, shadows soft and features vaguely defined. The only pronounced edges were in his chapped lips, which were pale and scored with deep slits. The center was ornamented by a pearl of dried blood—even that, in its perfect symmetry, resembled the mark of a saint. Or a martyr.

**Reality?**

* Constant grinding issues and ratcheting noise
* Frequent tweaking of PSI, grind size, and calibrations
* After 7 months, the grinder failed completely
* Turns out many users report the same—**underpowered and poorly designed grinder**

Ello ello, I'm Lewis! A 30 year old lanky brit on the search for something meaningful.

I've been single for a while after coming out of a 7 year long relationship. While I'm not looking for romance, I do miss the closeness, care and daily connection that comes with deep companionship. That's what I'm hoping to find here with you. A genuine friendship with someone who's maybe a little needy, a little silly, and looking for a safe, steady presence in their life. If you're looking for that kind of bond too, then maybe we're what each other needs.

I know this kind of connection isn’t what everyone’s looking for. But for me, I’m drawn to something a little more nurturing, a little more emotionally invested.

I'm like an onion. There's layers. Just try not to cry while you peel them back to discover what lays deep within. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. Same goes for my toast. I draw the line at crumpets though.

A little about me:

* Recently started the gym. Please remind me to go, I'll pretend to grumble but secretly love it.
*  I cycle, hike, and occasionally socialise with the other unlucky sods I call friends.
* I'm considering starting rock climbing/bouldering. I can't wait to grab the first two holds and re-evaluate my life choices
* Big metalhead - You'll find me at Bloodstock this year (yes, I've already got the tickets!)
* Currently playing Satisfactory, but I've been known to disappear into OldSchool RuneScape and reappear 6 months later.
* I’m building an indie Android game and trying not to lose my mind doing it. Code is pain.
* I have a 6-year-old daughter who’s a huge part of my world. Who would have thought, me? A father?! Somehow she makes me feels like I've got half a clue what I'm doing... She's my tiny chaos goblin and I wouldn't change any of it.

Looking for:

* Age 21- 40. Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
* Soft, silly, clingy, or chaotic in the best ways
* Up for regular chatting. I work a crazy schedule so timezones don't matter much. I'm around at stupid o'clock every day.
* We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
* Willing to share their day, their weird thoughts, and maybe trauma-dump just a little
* Happy to build a bond that feels comforting, consistent, and meaningful

1lztfdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1lztfdg/my_weekend_binging_alcoholic_husband30m_has/,My Weekend Binging Alcoholic Husband(30M) has Relapsed Twice... I'm(28F) at a breaking point.,"Hi reddit. My husband (30M) and I (28F) have been together for 8 years, married for 3. We own a house together, no kids, a cat and a dog.

My husband and I were always drinkers. We met at a party when I was 18, started a long distance relationship when I was 21 commuting 2 hours back and forth to see each other on the weekends. Most of the time we would meet up with friends and go out to bars or parties, always drinking. After two years of that we moved in together, which brought its own challenges of learning how to live together. We would drink every weekend, hang out with friends, go to breweries, something always involved drinking. That life style followed us when we bought a home together. Always drinking on the weekend.

For me, that started to stop about a year ago. After my sisters baby shower, my family sat down with my husband and I and called attention to our drinking. They said it was worrisome, that I (me) was having to chase my husband around with water that he refused to drink. They said it was time to grow up, that people shouldn't have to babysit other adults.

I really took that advice to heart, I didn't want to be a sloppy person. I'd been wanting to try out a sober lifestyle, really figure out what I like to do. I felt like my entire identity was drinking, it was scary to know that but also scary to try and figure out who I was.

Fast forward to 6 months ago, my husbands drinking started getting out of control. I had tried to stop drinking at this point, tried to convince him to take a break with me. He would agree but then would show up with a case of something on the weekends. But then he started drinking later on sundays, started calling out of work on monday's. At that point I made a rule, no more drinking. Then he started sneaking it. Drinking liquor when he wasn't even a big liquor drinker. At one point he took all of the liquor bottles in the house and smashed them on the patio outside. He would lie, and hide, and sneak. I lost all trust in him.

Other times he would be so intoxicated I would take his keys and lock myself in the bedroom, because he was prone to drinking and driving. The last time that happened I called the cops, because he was trying to break the door down and I was really scared. After that time, my family and I had an intervention with his mother and him, and he agreed to go to a 30 day in patient rehabilitation center. That was in May.

That month was really hard for me, our house literally tried to fall apart, I had to manage everything. I kept the house chaos from him until he got back from rehab so that he could focus on healing and himself. He understood when I told him and seemed grateful. I really did a lot of growing that month, I had been sober myself for about a month at that point, I was losing weight, I realized how strong of a person I am, and I found some peace in my home after months of being in survival mode. I found peace in solitude.

I was nervous for him to come home, I felt like a different person, I still do. He said he was a different person, too. But things were good when He got back, he had already hit 30 days in rehab, and then we made it to 60. He was going to IOP 3 days a week, and had an individual therapist. He was also going to AA meetings on saturdays and sundays. He had a sponsor. Things were looking good at 60 days.

Then we hit 65, this was two weeks ago. We'd had a beautiful saturday, going to a farmers market, drinking coffee, just a slow easy day together. We were working on a puzzle (something we both find joy in) when I finally succumbed to my instincts and asked him if he had been drinking. I had started to notice something was off earlier in the afternoon, but brushed it off - because we were at 65 days, id been with him the whole day - there was no way, right? Wrong. He had gone to the market to get propane and in that 15 minute timespan had gotten 2 tall boys and chugged them on the way home.

It sucked. And he lied, did the normal ""you think i've been drinking alcohol?"" told me the breathalyzer was wrong (even when I blew it and got 0.00 reading). I wasn't even that upset over the slip, its the lying that gets me. That breaks me. But I managed. i didn't freak out, I called my dad for support and then got him to call his sponsor. We slept in different rooms for the week but came back together and talked about it, and last weekend he started sleeping in the room again. We established a ""natural consequence"" of lying is sleeping in separate rooms for a week.

Last weekend was pretty good, we went floating on the river for the fourth, did some yard work that we enjoy and had some good dinners. The following week was tough, he was stressed out from work and we got in an argument on wednesday and he went to sleep in the spare. I'm always the one who resolves our fights, who initiates the fixing. This time I didn't. Come saturday and I'd gone to pilates in the morning and was at lowes looking for stuff to plant, because in my sobriety and finding myself i've found I really love to garden. He showed up at lowes, told me in AA they had talked about humility and he knew he was terrible at humility. Told me he was sorry for the week, that he loves me. It meant a lot that he showed up. We finished shopping at lowes and had a fantastic day together.

Now yesterday. We woke up early and had a slow morning, sitting on our deck drinking coffee and tea listening to the morning nature sounds of birds and cicadas. Laughing - a lot of laughing. We made a full breakfast, we had a plan to go to the pool in the afternoon after he got done with AA.

I work on homework while hes gone (i'm in a masters program online). he comes home and we leave for the pool around 1 and return around 330. I have some homework to finish up so I go and start working on that. We have a plan to make dinner around 6 and he's planning to finally call his younger brother and tell him about his drinking problem and how he went to rehab. I'm feeling good, like we are breaking through, like he's waking up and growing and seeing it.

Then I get that feeling, that something is off with him. He's acting restless, keeps forgetting what we're planning to make for dinner. I let it slip, just once. But it rears up again when he tells me his sponsor wants to mee to give him some AA books, we pick a meeting spot for them. Then maybe 5 minutes later he asks ""would you hate me if I went to the gym right now?"" and thats when I tell him he's acting off, that he's supposed to meet his sponsor at 530 and then call his brother at 630 and we were going to make dinner while he did that. That there wasn't time for the gym with all of that. I ask him if he'll breathalyze, and he starts making faces. He finally does, and tries to ""fake blow"" the breathalyzer. It still comes back a 0.14. He tells me its wrong, so I blow it and its a 0.00. he does it again, reads a 0.15. Then the classic ""you think i've been drinking alcohol?"" comes out. After 10 painful minutes of begging him to just be honest, the truth comes out:

immediately after AA at 11am he crossed the street and allegedly bought two tallboy 9.5% beers. He allegedly had one before we left for the pool. He drove, so he drove me drunk without my knowledge. When we got back he started the second and had just finished it. His plan to meet with his sponsor was a facade. He had change his own contact information in his phone to be his sponsor and was texting himself to make it look like a conversation was happening with his sponsor. This was all so he could go to the meeting spot (a gas station) to buy more beer.

Some of you might say ""how did you not know"" and I really don't know. I'm finely tuned into his behavior when he starts drinking, I know that. But I think the morning had been so beautiful, and I was focused on school, it was a beautiful day and I wasn't looking out for the signs he exhibits when he starts drinking. So I just don't' know how I missed them prior to the pool.

My point in all of this is to ask, what the hell do I do now? I'm tired. I've tried, literally everything, to keep our marriage together. To support him, to encourage him, and I just keep getting bitched slapped. I don't think he's taking it seriously, I can't even confirm if hes going to AA or just sitting in a parking lot. Hes been given books, apps, support groups. Activities, engaging hobbies, things to fill up his time. He's not physically addicted to alcohol. Mentally? Maybe, sure I don't know. but i'm struggling to believe that someone who was invested in their healing would go to AA and then immediately walk to the store and get beer. That someone would actively make a plan. These ""slips"" as he calls them, haven't been emotionally induced, there wasn't some major or even minor triggering event that set him off into stress and he couldn't handle it. He wasn't pressured. He has so many people standing behind him, saying call me if you need help. Call me when you get an urge. He has a sponsor. but he doesn't pick up the phone.

I love him, but I want to leave. But I also don't want to, but I don't think he's trying and I have an awful gut feeling he's not going to change. when is enough, enough?",4,1752515720.0,AlAnon,2,1.0,False

→ They give you $10 free after your first purchase if you sign up through a referral link (and I get $10 too). Happy to drop it in the comments or DM if anyone’s interested.


📈 Acorns (Spare Change Investing) – This rounds up your everyday card purchases and automatically invests the difference. So like, a $2.70 coffee becomes $3.00 and that $0.30 gets invested. I use it for passive investing without having to think about it.

→ There’s a promo where they give a bonus if a few friends sign up and invest. I can share the referral link if you’re curious and want to try it — we both benefit.

I’ve struggled with severe driving anxiety since I first started learning, I even contemplated quitting the idea of driving altogether but after some practice outside of the pressures of driving school- I finally got the hang of it and even started to feel confident in my driving skills. 

I don’t have my license yet but I’ve been doing some simple driving like quick coffee runs at the shops near my house. This has really helped with building my confidence as it’s all been going very smoothly.. until today. 

I was about to park near my local coffee shop when I realised my car was too close to the one parked next to my spot. I then panicked, instead of stopping to reverse my foot went on the wrong pedal and I ended up crashing into the corner of that car, causing a noticeable dent above the left headlight. I was so scared, my first thought was to flee the scene and park at a nearby alley. 

After calming down a bit, I realised what I had just done, and that my coffee that I had already paid for online was still there waiting for me to pick up.  I quickly tried to go back to the same spot to find the owner of the car I had hit to apologise and offer to pay for the damages, but when I got back, I realised the car had already left. 

I was so overwhelmed with shame and guilt that my driving skills seemed to have somewhat depleted on the drive home, I had trouble focusing and staying steady in my lane- just like how I was like when I first started.

1lzta5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NoddyWonk/comments/1lzta5s/i_have_stolen_a_diary_from_the_vatican_archives/,I Have Stolen A Diary From The Vatican Archives,"""We shall not all sleep, but we will be changed..."" (1 Corinthians 15:51-53)

\*Editors note: Ok my friends, man I’m starting to talk like him already, I’ve just been listening to this tape over and over and over, I thought that quote was fitting. Ok so I didn’t actually find the diary I’ll get to that, I found this tape recorder here stuffed under the seat cushion of a cafe just around the alle fornaci, near the Piazza di Santa Maria, just outside Vatican City. Got a nice vibe honestly I’d recommend it if you’re ever there. I lucked out on this work do fr. Any way so I found this tape recorder and on it is this he’s like a professor type dude talking about this diary he snuck out from the Vatican archives like some 3am type shit ya know gotta respect him for that and yeah so he’s talking and he’s reading through this diary which is actually like two diaries of these researchers, shits wild man I’m writing this stuff down, I’ve written out the first chunk like an actual transcript of the recording you know, it’s pretty long but I’m into it dude the worlds gotta know you know? Ok here’s where I’m at so far, enjoy! 

\[ I have stolen a diary from the Vatican archives! My goodness I cannot believe this what I am doing now I’m spitting my coffee everywhere on the table hang on I need a cigarette hang on. Sorry if you can hear rustling my friends ah there, is this? Is this? Ah bless you my friend bless you, owner is letting me smoke here indoors he’s old senile man like me he’s lighting up too I think. Ah ok, hmmm ah to see that beautiful smoke plume about the room nowhere can you do this now, absolutely nowhere its a disaster to mankind, so beautiful too, watching it rise and hang about the dusty ceiling fan and slip away up some crack in the plaster. Ok I’m sorry for this romantic er wax lyrical yes! I hear in a movie ‘wax lyrical’ I’m waxing lyrical! But I am at this moment filled with dread really, truly my friends, I have just had a read through of this and what I have read makes me question all of it I don’t know. I am filled with so many questions, and dread, really, as I say I don’t know, I don’t know what to make of it. I will tell you now what I have found. 

It is a diary, and in it, it’s twin. Yes and it tells of an expedition by two Italian researchers of the ruins buried beneath the Vatican. Why was I here at the Vatican? I was invited for my research many times, but this time I see this diary, ah yes I will be here a while I think if that’s alright, yes thank you bless you again my friend, fortunate I think that I don’t disturb anyone else with my ramblings hah! Yes just this one light will be fine bless you and I watch the traffic go by from the window. He’s wiping down the tables in the far corner, we won’t be interrupted my friends. So this diary is a composite of two diaries spliced together in this way, one from each researcher, with each entry twinned with the other. It is a truly remarkable thing. It is in Italian which I happen to speak but I don’t read it so much so I will translate as I read to you I may not know but I will make educated guess as you would say er in certain parts. My friends do not listen to me lightly now for what I am about to read may change you as it has changed me. \]

Aria diary, Pre expedition: St Peters Basilica, had you been born inside and never let out, you would think it the whole world and be quite contented. It’s majesty is overwhelming, it’s roof is like a second sky, noble pillars like stone trees, walls and doors and stairs with enough statues to fill a bustling city. Yes it is as a world in itself. It took over a hundred years to build and every architect involved in its construction died before he could see his work finished. Yes it was built by the dead, and for the dead. At its crown is the ceremonial tomb of St Peter, said to be placed above the actual grave of that ancient man. In the coming days we may yet find out. That’s a good introduction, keep this for future report Aria. I’m nervous but mostly excited, this discovery could be huge for well everyone I suppose, whatever we find, if anything. Though this tunnel they’ve found is not a geological anomaly I think, it is localised directly beneath an important place of worship, ancient and Roman, paved over in a thin veil of mosaic slate. The floor, beautiful though it was, cracked like an egg shell when the stone cornucopia fell on it. Seems to me that we were meant to find it at some point, even if it took two thousand years for someone to knock that thing off its pedestal. We met with Vatican authorities and university representatives and always we were circled by papal advisers, black robed and red sashed; The Council of Cardinals. They watched us intently, always listening and conferring with each other. We are here at their request though they never addressed me directly. I feel as though you know when they say don’t name the farm animals.

They had cancelled any afternoon tours so the hall was empty. It’s hard to talk here the echo is so cacophonous. As they led us deeper into the Basilica we passed through more modest rooms and hallways where we discussed the finer details. Recovery teams are on standby but they’ll be relatively lax on the first day, given the surprising estimates for duration. It is said the tunnel is extensive, and goes deep beneath the earth, and then there’s the door. We were led into a small grotto, a little private church like a 1/2 scale miniature for a movie set, complete with little pews like the chairs we had in primary school. This is a place of private prayer it is explained, a stunning contrast from the overwhelming extravagance of the grand hall of the nave and the central dome. I took the opportunity to address one of the Cardinals, something like, ‘the layers of this building is just extraordinary’. He smiled but never looked at me, he just laughed and said, ‘In my Fathers house there are many rooms’. At the far end was a door even I had to duck to get under. It led into a hallway that still we were bowing our heads brushing against the ceiling, the walls were merely arms length and we were single file now. Down narrow steps we went in a spiral. No longer renaissance, far older but the steps were pristine. They lit LED torches, a white ghostly light flooded the stairwell. “These are the stairs of St Clement” they said, “the staircase to the necropolis, city of the dead.” We stepped gradually downward, catching ourselves nervously on the narrow walls. “The first stair was placed at the last burial, and built backwards, never descended. The workers sealed the stair and never returned, lest they disturb the sleep of the dead.” 

As we moved through older walls of the Vatican so too we moved through older beliefs of Christianity; the later gospels of Mark and Luke emphasise spiritual resurrection, it is the spirit that ascends to heaven. However St Peter bore witness to the bodily resurrection of Christ, as well as spiritual, his broken body entombed, emerged whole and so preached that we too will be resurrected in our bodies at the final judgement. So the bodies entombed down here have been preserved, much like the Pharaohs found in the Valley of the Kings, and as we stepped off the staircase and into the necropolis, that much was clear. Bandaged bodies stacked like books lined the walls that disappeared up into shadow. There were buildings, all houses, with viewless windows, doorless frames, stairs to nowhere, cooking utensils and empty beds. There was a small town centre of sorts with a central well, long since dried if ever there was water. We followed cables now that snaked along the floor through the small city, between buildings down alleys dotted with safety ramps and flood lights, they were leading us to the courtyard. A sort of public area like a playground, dust covered floor, terracotta stained walls, and the central plinth, with the stone cornucopia split in two upon the cracked slate floor. 

This was it, my first look at it. The pictures showed a black shadow beneath the floor, something you could fall into if you weren’t careful I thought, the black gate of hell we all imagined in this place. But here it is just a crawlspace, it goes 2 feet below the floor if that, and just wide enough for one person to get on their belly and crawl through, completely prone. But it has been made by tools, and the scans show it leads under the necropolis steadily sloping downwards before reaching a ‘door’ of some kind. They know its a door because further tunnels lead beyond it. As I write this it is hitting me that my work is no longer just theory, that I’ll be the one crawling down there, for three days. 

Matteo diary, Pre expedition: Christ she could have worn something more professional than leggings, I mean we’re in the Vatican for fuck sake, the Basilica of St. Peter. She doesn’t understand that it reflects poorly on me. You bring your gear in a bag and you get changed after the formal greetings. This is basic stuff. It’s all going in the report when we get back. She’s already a distraction, it’s bad for the mission. She’s not exactly a head turner but it’s just weird seeing her again let alone at her request. I’m surprised she’s even in demand. I wasn’t wrong about her but I suppose some people just slip through the cracks regardless of actual ability. Anyway the briefing was good, pretty much matched my own analysis of the situation, nothing new to learn from these guys. My expertise is really going to shine here. The ultrasound scans look promising, my most optimistic guess is that we will find the true tomb of St Peter, we may even recover his bones. Indeed there are tombs down there, earth untouched since the days of the apostles, and I will be the first.

\[ You see they prepare now to venture beneath the earth. The Vatican is truly splendid I have seen much of it but never have I been led down such steps as this to the necropolis. Through the tourist entrance only have I done so. The Excavators found many curious things there as leather slippers by the beds presumably for the dead upon waking. Much has our traditions changed don’t you think friends? The expedition is about to begin, I feel now a pity as I read for Aria. \]

Aria diary, Day 1: The crawlspace floor was sunk in an inch of fine ash, like crawling through the oven of a crematorium left to cool after the burning. Death is on all of our minds down here. It was all I could do not to breath it in, straining my neck to keep my chin above the ashes. About 40 minutes into the crawl our body heat began to cook the tunnel; slicks of sweat slunk down my nose tickled my lip and dripped into the ash, then evaporated up and condensed on the ceiling dripping down into my hair and on the back of my neck. God it’s like breathing through a jockstrap. And now the ash has turned to a mud, a slimy porridge it’s caked the equipment. I found a breast stroke movement to wade through the ashen mud kept it from building up under my chin as I heaved my body forward. But I am writing now because we have reached the door. After a two hour crawl we’ve made it, the cave swells around the door and so we can stand with knees bent, give our arms and legs a stretch and rest. So the door, what to say about it, it’s just a door as you would know it, a wooden door, about 4ft tall. The wood should have long since rotted away, but I suppose like the thousands of wooden stilts beneath Venice, the wood has been petrified in some way so as to be preserved. It has an iron ring handle that lifts a simple latch on the other side and it will open. There are engravings however, scratched coarsely against the grain, improvised or done in hast. We can’t read it, it is not latin as I would have expected from a Roman ruin. It could be said to be kin of Aramaic though upside down. 

Matteo diary, Day 1: I encouraged Aria to ring out her shirt like I have, better for the days ahead, no point being a prude down here we’ve got a job to do and it’ll go a lot smoother if we’re not sodden in sweat and mud. The crawlspace was very challenging but we passed through without issue, I probably could have gone faster if I wasn’t holding up the rear. I’ll take the lead now that we’ve reached the door. I’ve studied the scans and from the two I’ve decided it’s best to take the tunnel on the right that slops down from beyond this door. I must say the door is not what I expected, it’s very simple, it is not decorated at all like the seal of a tomb. 

Aria diary, Day 1, Secondo: We’ve radioed in that we’ve reached the first checkpoint. From here communications are expected to drop given the depth and density of the rock above us now. So now the crew is relying most on our estimated time of return; a three day expedition. We will continue our radio prompts as normal but we’re not to panic if we get no response, easier said than done. It was all in the briefing and I agreed, but now that we’re down here it’s hard not to feel so far removed from it. We are at the door beneath the earth now, and with the layers of rock and dirt, chamber atop chamber holding up the heft of the grand Basilica, there might as well be a mountain above our heads. 

\[ Something here leaps out at me from the pages friends about this door that they have found. It reminds me of a fascinating article I referenced from the journal of the society of theological archeology of Ankara, by a professor Murat: ‘Semiotics as language in the ancient world’ it was called yes, where Murat himself claims to have found at the back of a cave in the horn of Africa, desperate markings scratched by nail and bone. Described as ‘protoaramiac’ in nature he argued that the er how you say primitive perhaps not right word but simple lines were evocative of a semitic seal either as a prayer or warning it is unclear for certain. He noted that the cave itself was known locally as in English something like ‘bountiful mouth’ where by their custom they would leave the bodies of the dead to be dismembered and eaten up by the beasts as to return to nature. Anyway I will continue reading now I apologise for this interruption I interrupt I cannot help it now. \] 

Aria diary, Day 2: I’ve just awoken from a dream, it was pulling me down, I had to wrench myself from sinking forever. Blinking in the dark. I have to get it down. I’m writing by the light of my headlamp now, it’s the only light we have left. I was swimming, treading water in a deep lake far from shore. It was wondrous, I felt wondrous. I was compelled by an uncanny curiosity for all things, as all things were new to me. How the scarlet sash of the rising sun sparked the sky alight, tearing asunder the thundering clouds. How the green water writhed around me. A prickly static in the air I lifted my nose to it. It was all so wondrous. I saw the birds in the sky, I heard the beasts on the land, and so I wandered what was beneath the water. I bowed my head and dipped below the surface. Opening my eyes to the blurry green world I saw great spears of sunshine pierce the water from above, but falter and fade into the shadows of the deep. I saw something move far away, far below my kicking feet. So far it was as a shadow passing through shadow. It pushed through the water like some giant slug. It curled slowly twisting its soft limbless mass. Fear overwhelmed my wonder and I snapped my head out of the water. I splashed and kicked but could make no movement, I cried out to no-one, the clouds eclipsed the sun. In darkness, the water turned a black ink. I breathed in. I breathed out. The last crescent of light above vanished behind the storm. The waves of the water lilted softly before settling still. I too became still. I dipped my head below once more and saw before me a giant grey face it was smiling rising from the depths and I awoke to a darkness as dark as any deep. Matteo had taken my headlamp off me in my sleep.

We have fallen. We took the path that sloped right after passing through the door. Walking on bent knees he took the lead, and I trusted his experience as I had prepared myself to do so before the mission. He had won the confidence of the team above and I might’ve shared their enthusiasm had I never met him. But we were following the map. Ahead of me he walked when he suddenly fell into the ground kicking up ash. He had slipped through a fissure and was grappling on the rock, I reached down for him but he lost his footing and dragged me down too. We’re not seriously hurt only a bit scratched up by some miracle. But our equipment is dire, down to one radio that’s hissing at me, and one headlamp between us. I made the decision that we would rest here, take stock and reassess our situation. Matteo kicked his pack but eventually backed down. I could tell he was tired. The walls here are masoned, great bricks of carven stone, sharp and black as slate. A hallway seems to stretch onwards but it’s too dark. It might be for the best if we just stay put, ride out the next two days and wait for rescue. Though I can’t stay still. Now that I’ve had some sleep I almost wish I hadn’t. That dream. That face I can’t shake it, I’m crying I think, yes. Oh Aria. I miss the sky, I miss my cat Diner, and now he’s gawking at me.

Matteo diary, Day 2: Someones certainly getting emotional down here. Yes what do you know she’s curled up away from me in the foetal position scratching away at her diary, lord knows what she’s on about in that thing. We’re not lost necessarily, the tunnels have just proven different to the schematics we’d been given, it’s not my fault though. Heads are gonna roll for this when we get out, they know I’m a big deal, and once they realise we’re late to return they’ll be organising a ‘rescue’ party to come get us, I have no doubt, unless they’re even more incompetent than they’ve proven to be. I can lead us out no problem, it’s classic caving, I had the basics figured out before most, but she won’t submit, she’s got that woman brain see’s me as the patriarchy or something, just that performative neofeminism bullshit you know, fact is I’m the more experienced caver on this expedition so it’s only right that I lead, gender doesn’t come into it. If we’re lost it’s because of her honestly, and I’ll write as much in my report when I get out of here. But despite her failings I did feel for her earlier, she started crying, burst out into tears, I knew it was coming. It is dark and dangerous down here and we’re all alone I get it, it’s scary. I watched a tear slide down her cheek and slip into her cleavage. I have, and of course I would never, this is just for reference, but it has crossed my mind that we’re all alone down here. She’s probably feeling it too. I mean plain Jane’s not the best girl I’ve had but down here we might as well be Adam and Eve. 

\[ Friends we may have some company soon I don’t know, a black car has been parked in the road for 15 even maybe more minutes I don’t know, just stopped in the road as traffic goes around it, beeping their horns at it. I didn’t notice it for the constant stream of headlights flashing through the rain, that nice orange light you get on old cars sometimes it is nice though a cafe window. But now I think this car is not so nice. But worry not friends I am old, what they come up and say ten years in Gulag? I say to them I think I won’t even make the plane journey there! I will read on, yes read on I shall this is important now I think very much. I am warm and comfortable and I blow smoke at them hah! \] 

\*Editors note: You know I’m really feeling this guy, he’s got that passion I vibe with it, was thinking of writing a song about it or something like classic just me and my guitar like ‘Hey there Aria’ I don’t know that just came to me, is that something you guys would be interested in? Yeah I could even record it on this same tape recorder so it’ll like tell the story in that way you know have those layers going on, I like the sound it makes when I have to rewind it too I could use that, yeah I’ll play around with it. Any way I’ve finished typing up the rest of the transcript, haven’t typed this much since college dude frfr. 

Matteo diary, Day 3: I’ve taken the lead and she’s following behind me like a lost puppy. There’s no way I was about to sit and wait for two days in the solid dark whilst a rescue team fumbles about. It doesn’t make sense for that crawlspace to be the only entrance or exit from this place. These hallways, about as wide as my wingspan, are stone brick, so the masons would have had to dig a mineshaft to shuttle shale and dirt to the surface, I just have to find it. The way the brickwork of the walls transition seamlessly to bare rock in places seems to me that the architect of this ancient place adapted the passages from natural tunnels already in the earth. At least I can walk tall in this place, there’s no sight of a ceiling. I’m keeping to the right anytime a hallway ends. We’ve made two right turns now. The last three hallways each terminated into identical antechambers with hallways verging left or right. Always at the far end is a small alter table with a loaf of bread, warm as though freshly baked, and a cup of wine. I’m not about to eat nor drink anything from a tomb, smells corked to me anyway. The bread’ll be rotten, it’s a trick of the dark. It gets to you. It would get to anyone even the most experienced caver as I am. No one could get a decent sleep in a place like this. I had a dream last night, and the song is stuck in my head. After a day of skittering about endless hallways it was sensible to make camp, though I didn’t find much rest. I rolled out my bed against the cold wall of the hallway and lay down to face Aria. It would be warmer if we huddled, It’s a matter of survival now, but she’s frigid. She had to sleep near me at least anyway because I’ve kept the headlamp on me, don’t trust her not to break it somehow. But this dream, I need to get it down it’ll clear my head. 

I was in the dark, a dark cave, and before me fell a moon beam like a spotlight on a stage. Sitting on a rock with the pale light on his back was the god Pan. The matted black fur on his legs absorbed the light. He was sitting with hooves crossed and with his flute in hand, breathing into it like air escaping the lungs of a corpse when the chest is compressed. The song he played was wondrous though. It was sad but mighty. I can honestly say I’ve never heard it before, my subconscious must have made it up, of course I had it in me. It lilts and marches, sighs and commands. The song a vulture would sing when waiting for its sorry prey to finally die. He seemed engrossed in his playing, and I risked moving closer, slowly. The grey mottled skin of his back looked sickly and smelled sour. I moved to circle him, to get a look at his face. I was parallel to him now when he stopped playing. He turned his face to me, smiling a toothless gummy grin. A slug of drool hung off his lip to his flute. Then he stood up, laughed a bellowing laugh and burrowed himself under the earth as a worm eats through dirt. I woke up flinging my arms up as if it was me who had been buried. She was looking at me, I didn’t like it. 

Aria diary, Day 3: Matteo went darting down the hall with my headlamp. Since I’m the appointed lead on this expedition the safety of us both is my responsibility, I had no choice but to follow him. He’s convinced they’ll be another way out close by, and perhaps he’s right. But the further we go into this maze the further the rescue teams have to go to find us. I’m going only by the light bobbing off his forehead, behind me is darkness always, like it’s chasing us. These hallways are featureless and each ends in the same antechamber. There’s a three foot drop to the floor when we exit a hallway. Every turn we make we venture deeper into the earth. But there’s something else, at the far wall of each antechamber is a simple table, white clothed, baring bread and wine. It is the Eucharist right? I can’t help but feel like we are being given chances to, I don’t know, chances. This place is getting to me. 

\[ This. It shakes my belief, maybe carbon dioxide build up in the tunnels I don’t know. And right here loose as a bookmark is a written note from a Cardinal Alessio I will read it to you, “The tunnels seem as though a labyrinth beneath the Basilica. My own appointed specialists have scaled the fissure and are now attempting to find *those*stairs that are most intriguing. Concerning the eucharist, it is my recommendation that if we can find it we will treat this as a miracle in our efforts to beautify his holiness the pope upon his death whenever that may be. The accounts of these two subjects will be used in private for such a purpose as this.” They move now to follow them down there wherever they may be I don’t know. But I will read now from Aria my friends for things they have not gone so well. \]

Aria diary, Day 3, Secondo: I can still hear him screaming in the walls. I ran there’s nothing I can do, there’s nothing I can do. Matteo he found along the wall of a hallway an opening at the base like a vent, “it’s another crawlspace” he said he was convinced it must be the way out so he fell down onto his belly and crawled inside it I grabbed his legs but he kicked me. I was screaming for him all I could do was watch the light of his headlamp grow smaller and smaller in the dark. I could hear him scrapping his elbows against the walls and dragging his chest on the rock. But then he stopped, about thirty feet away from me I think. He said he could see feet. The soles of feet as of someone lying on their chest. Fleshy pink soles and thick yellow toenails, like they were preserved. Then he screamed he was screaming “they’re moving oh my god oh my god” they were moving oh my god he said there were more he could see more ahead another and another he said it goes on and on through the earth he was screaming “get me out"" but there was nothing I could do there’s nothing I can do. I ran in the dark I ran I grabbed his pack off the floor and ran I hit my head I think I kept running and now I’m here. I’m here at the foot of it. It’s a staircase, it goes up I haven’t climbed it yet. I’m writing by the thread of light coming from above. But I can still hear him. He’s stuck. He’s crying for his mother. He’s crying. This must be a way out, this must be. 

\[ …I… I don’t know. I will just read on I think. Yes that is for the best I think… \]

Aria diary Day 4: I’ve come back down. I’m sat on the step at the foot of the stairs, writing by this last light, reflecting on what I’ve seen. It’s all quiet now. No tears. The stairs opened out into a small grotto of white washed stone, man made it seemed to me, entirely like an ancient church of the holy land, with a high window beaming warm midday sunshine onto the far wall. And there on the far wall the light bloomed upon a faded fresco, of green grass and golden earth, with trees Olive and Sweet thorn and strong Palestinian Oak. Petals fell upon a blue stream that wound through reeds to a glade in it’s centre. And there stood another tree, solitary, sentinel, and entirely dead. It made me shudder. Then I noticed a small wooden door on the wall to my left, like a shed door honestly. A cool draft tickled my toes and I could hear on the other side a wind in the treetops and the songs of birds and streams and whistling reeds, like the fresco, only I dared not open the door. I felt, ashamed. I felt as though I would be trespassing, I can’t explain it. I felt suddenly that I should not be caught lingering here, lest unseen forces might hurt me. I can’t explain it. I did not feel alone. I’m back in the tunnel now, close to where we parted though I cannot hear him screaming anymore. I keep thinking about that room. I keep thinking about it. I will miss the light but I have to go back. I must endure this darkness still. 

\[ There is only one more entry after this. I hope most sincerely friends that the Cardinals team has found her down there though for who knows how long she wanders. But the room she finds I must talk about it. For what could this be if not the garden? *The* Garden, as the story goes with the apple and the ya know. Was this real or was she granted a vision I don’t know but it is her hesitation that interests me really. She hears beyond the door the sounds of a paradise, again *the* paradise but she turns away, why if not only for the innate in all of us feeling that we are unworthy no? 

This story and I am not a religious er I’m certainly not a ‘man of the cloth’ as you might say but this is consistent with that catastrophic betrayal that lead to our you and me and all to death and ruin. Beauty, that is what she is describing. And why does she feel unworthy of this ‘trespassing’ as she says it is because of beauty! There is nothing my friends, nothing more well you know I do like the women you know especially from certain angles you know I kid here of course but I am serious now when I say this; That there is nothing more beautiful than Creation. From stars flinging dust spinning moons around planets and electrons orbiting neutrons protons etc you know and the crickets playing their sweet sweet violins in the tall grass and the great bear scratching its back on the bark and you know so much more of this, the tardigrade for example fantastic creature. And who does he the big man appoint to care for all this? 

Yes! Yours truly you and I and all of us my friends! Even this God himself does not touch it after Creation read the book the bible it will tell all he does not create after creating in the beginning, he leaves it to us, why? Why do we till the dirt and tame the wolf? Why do we like the little critters that go boing boing through the woods and up to our porch with its whiskers and we give it bread and watch it scurry away? Why do we like this so much? Because my friends we are the caretakers. Or were supposed to be. To tend the garden from which all of paradise may spread forth and encompass the whole world. But instead we did this betrayal and now we must fight like rats in buckets for scraps of happiness. And until we our worthy again we may not enter the garden, so it seems to me. And this is what this woman here feels most strongly so strongly she turns away, dutifully as if in atonement. I wish we could see this garden my friends I wish she did not turn away. May it be enough that we can hear the sweet birds and the soft breeze from the other side of the door. \] 

Aria diary, Day (unspecified): I eat the bread and drink the wine. Every turn I eat and drink. I crawl through halls and sleep on ash. I cannot see. I feel the walls on my finger tips. I hear panicked voices chant in the dark. My rescuers?

\[ They are coming now, they don’t know I have recorded it I think not, they just think I am an old man rambling by the window. I will have to give it up to them but I will hide you here under the cushion, farewell my friends! Good evening gentlemen, Ciao! Allegro allegro! No no, no no it is a gift, a souvenir from the gift shop. Don’t rush me I’m an old man as you see, do not rush me okay? Okay? Hey okay I’m getting up, hey!..wait a minute that’s too hard, ah! You know fascism originated here in Italy you know!… \] 

\*Editors note: That’s it, there’s about twenty minutes of crackle after that, some sounds of traffic then *click,* it shuts off. I guess they got the old man huh, and the diary too. He never did give his name, not out of prudence though probably just excitement and nerves, can’t look him up or nothing. But yeah, that’s it. Man if it’s true though, wild you know? I’m definitely gonna work on that song. Last thing though, stuck on the back of the tape recorder is this business card for a bakery somewhere in Italy, but on the back in pencil is scribbled ‘From the Gospel of Thomas: The Disciples said to him. “When will the Kingdom come?” And Jesus replied, “The Kingdom of the Father is spread out upon the earth, and people do not see it.” (Saying 113)’  

Disclaimer: 

Thank you for reading I hope you enjoyed it. First I’d like to say that whilst I hope my respect for the beliefs of Christianity and the Abrahamic religions concerned is clear, I of course have used certain things to certain effect. Chiefly the attitudes towards burial proposed in the story. Christian attitudes have changed over time of course but I make no judgment on my part, I just needed an excuse to line the walls with bodies. In fact a historically cherished tradition associated with such religions are Ossuaries, where the bones of the departed are placed in small boxes often found interred in family tombs in and around Jerusalem and Jericho, and as far as Rome as a tradition of the Roman Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodoxy. Cremation too is now just as proper a means of burial as any other, having increased in popularity after the first world war and is now widely accepted by most Christian denominations whom state, ‘…In the end, however, we should remember that the resurrection will take place by the power of God, who created the heavens and the earth. Ultimately, whether a person's body was buried at sea, destroyed in combat or an accident, intentionally cremated or buried in a grave, the person will be resurrected. -Church of LDS (wikipedia) 

Secondly I appreciated the misogyny is hard to read. It’s certainly on all our minds right now with everything going on in the world but I hope it’s worth it for the story.

And lastly take care of yourself. There’s a lot of bad going on out there and we can’t help but feel powerless to it all. But if you can find the time and energy to do something you love, even if it’s writing silly stories on reddit, then do it and life will get better I promise. Happiness is a fleeting thing, all we can do is try. Failure doesn’t come in to it. ",1,1752515408.0,u_NoddyWonk,0,1.0,False

I went on a first date (barely even, literally the first time meeting him off a dating app). We met at a coffee shop, and we talked for about an hour. I enjoyed it, and I was planning to see him again. 

He leaned in for a hug outside the coffee shop and went in for a kiss. I felt obligated to kiss him and also kinda wanted to see if he was a good kisser. He was, no issues there, but we got in his car for him to drop me home and he leaned in to kiss me more. We kissed for 10mins before he went to drive me 7minutes down the street to my house. I kept pausing and saying “i really need to get home to sleep” “i’ve got an early day tomorrow”. 

He pulls over less than 1 mile from my house (so like 5mins into the drive) and leans in to kiss me more. Doesn’t ask if it’s ok, just assumes i’m into it. I’m caught off guard at this point, no clue what to do, so i kiss him a bit, he reaches to grab my butt. I say i need to sleep and lean away after a few mins. 

He drops me off, says “oh i hope that was okay” and i say it’s fine (even though i shouldn’t have.) He then messages me saying he hopes it was okay that he grabbed my butt and that he just “couldn’t resist it.” I say it’s fine because i am too anti conflict and i was more concerned about getting to sleep lmao, but now I’ve got the ick. It’s been a few days and he keeps messaging me. I felt like he expected me to invite him in which is wild cause I previously told him i don’t let anyone in my place. He paused for a good few mins before driving away (i could see from inside.) 

I feel like he came on too strong and i don’t want to see him again because I am not looking for just sex (we discussed this before meeting.) how do I tell him this without feeling like i’m gona offend him? He also won’t stop asking what my plans are on the weekend even though i’ve said i’m busy lmao ahhhh. ",2,1752515372.0,dating_advice,8,0.75,False

Currently I’ve going multiple weeks without a BM. Fleet enemas only give me a little relief but causes mass amounts of pain, vomiting, nausea, and spike a fever. I’m waiting to get a colonoscopy and see GI, but I’m on a 1-year waitlist.  I rotate between a stimulate laxative, osmotic laxative, and stool softeners. I’ve tried Lactulose, magnesium citrate, sennosides, miralax, laxaday, prune juice, laxative jelly, coffee, Ducosate, suppositories and more. 

I’ve gone to the ER but since I’m passing gas they only give me a fleet enema which is only 50% effective and send me home. I’ve had multiple CTs, XRs and ultrasounds. I pass a lot of mucous so I’m suspecting an underlying GI disorder that has never been addressed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you dreaming of a cozy retreat in the heart of nature? 24x40 steel cabin kits could be the perfect solution for your rural living needs. These metal cabins combine comfort with practicality, making them an ideal choice for anyone looking to build a weekend getaway or a permanent home in a rural setting. Let’s explore the many benefits and features that these sturdy structures can offer.

### Durable and Long-Lasting

One of the standout features of 24x40 steel cabin kits is their durability. Steel structures are designed to withstand extreme weather conditions such as heavy snow, high winds, and heavy rain. Unlike traditional wood cabins, metal cabins are resistant to pests such as termites and rot. This means you can enjoy your cozy cabin without the constant worry of repairs and maintenance.

### Cost-Effective Living

Budget is always an essential factor in any construction project. Steel cabin kits are generally more cost-effective than traditional building materials. The kits come pre-designed and in ready-to-assemble components, which can significantly reduce labor costs. Many homeowners report spending less on construction mixed with the long-term savings due to less maintenance required. Investing in a 24x40 steel cabin kit can make your dream home a reality without breaking the bank.

### Efficient Use of Space

With a size of 24x40 feet, these cabins offer great flexibility and a smart layout. The generous dimensions provide ample space for essential rooms. You can customize the layout to include:

- A cozy living area
- One or two bedrooms
- A functional kitchen
- A bathroom
- Outdoor deck or porch space

This efficient utilization of space ensures you can create a wonderful living environment with room for relaxation and recreation.

### Energy Efficiency

Another impressive advantage of steel cabins is their energy efficiency. Steel’s thermal properties ensure better insulation, which helps maintain a comfortable temperature inside. This can make a significant difference in heating costs during the winter months. You might also consider installing solar panels for extra energy savings, making your 24x40 steel cabin a sustainable choice for living in rural areas.

### Quick Construction

Time is often of the essence when constructing your dream home. With steel cabin kits, the assembly process is fast and straightforward. Most kits come with pre-cut materials and detailed instructions. Many homeowners report completing assembly in a matter of weeks instead of months, allowing you to move into your cozy metal cabin sooner, just in time for that much-needed retreat.

### Low Maintenance Requirements

Adopting a steel cabin means enjoying low upkeep in the long run. Unlike wood, which requires painting, sealing, and inspections for pests, a steel cabin can be maintained with a simple wash. This not only saves you time but also gives you peace of mind, allowing you to spend more time relaxing and enjoying your rural property.

### Customizable Options

Many companies that offer 24x40 steel cabin kits also provide customizable options. You can choose colors, add windows, and select different roof styles to suit your style preferences. This means your cabin can be as unique as your personal aesthetic while still enjoying the numerous benefits of steel construction.

### Ideal for Different Uses

These metal cabins are incredibly versatile. Whether you envision a weekend retreat, a permanent residence, or a rental property, a 24x40 steel cabin can fulfill various roles. Their design can accommodate everything from a comfortable home to an artist's studio or even a workshop for hobbies. The possibilities are endless!

A 24x40 steel cabin kit could be your ideal choice for rural living. With benefits like durability, cost efficiency, quick construction, and low maintenance, investing in such a cabin not only meets your housing needs but also complements the beauty of nature around you. Transform your rural dream into reality with the cozy comfort of a metal cabin.

Tips for Customizing Your 24x40 Steel Cabin: Making It Feel Like Home in the Countryside
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customizing your 24x40 steel cabin can turn a standard structure into a cozy and inviting home in the countryside. Metal cabins offer unparalleled durability and design flexibility, making them perfect for rural properties. Here are some engaging tips to help you personalize your steel cabin and create a warm atmosphere.

### Start with Interior Layout

The layout is essential when it comes to feeling at home. Divide the 24x40 space into functional areas that suit your lifestyle. Consider the following:

- **Living Area:** Create a welcoming living space, perhaps with an open-plan design combined with your kitchen. Use comfortable seating and a coffee table to make it inviting.
- **Kitchen:** A cozy kitchen can serve as the heart of your cabin. Include a small dining table to enjoy meals with family and friends.
- **Bed and Bath:** Keep the bedroom and bathroom private yet accessible. A well-lit bathroom with modern fixtures can add a touch of luxury.

### Choose Warm Colors and Textures

Simple color choices can significantly affect the feel of your cabin. Opt for warm tones like soft yellows, earthy reds, or tranquil greens. These colors can make your steel cabin feel homier. Pair these with textures to add depth:

- **Wood Accents:** Incorporate wood elements like beams, floors, or furniture. They contrast beautifully against the steel.
- **Textiles:** Use soft blankets, cushions, and curtains in natural fibers to add comfort.

### Lighting Matters

The right lighting can change a space entirely. Consider incorporating multiple light sources to create ambient, task, and accent lighting:

- **Ambient Lighting:** Use overhead fixtures to fill the room with a soft glow.
- **Task Lighting:** Add lamps in reading nooks and bedside tables for practical purposes.
- **Accent Lighting:** Highlight artwork or architectural features with focused lighting.

### Outdoor Space Development

Don't forget about your surroundings! Your 24x40 steel cabin can be extended outdoors. Consider creating an inviting patio or deck where you can enjoy fresh air. Here’s how to shape your outdoor space:

- **Outdoor Furniture:** Invest in comfortable chairs and tables to host gatherings.
- **Landscaping:** Plant local flowers and shrubs that thrive in your area for a natural touch.
- **Fire Pit:** A designated fire pit area can become a great spot for evening relaxation.

### Add Personal Touches

Personalizing your space is crucial. Consider adding elements that reflect your personality:

- **Artwork:** Hang local art pieces or photographs that evoke memories of your life's journey.

1lzt0zq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lzt0zq/dating_a_coworker_of_someone_i_used_to_date/,Dating a coworker of someone I used to date.,"So I (25M) went on a date with a girl (lets call her J) from Hinge last night who I started to realize from bits of information that she works at the coffee shop that someone (lets call her X) I dated for a few months works at. For context, I dated X for 2-3 months a year ago (starting around June) and this was my attempt at dating again after my Ex of 2 years and I broke up in February. The relationship with my Ex was my first serious relationship I've been in so there was a lot to learn there emotionally and about myself. I started dating X and things seemed to go really well initially, but I started to realize i got infatuated from meeting and successfully dating this new person, and that blinded me from seeing that I didn't fully get along with this person well enough for something longterm. So I asked if we could reel back the intimacy (we did have sex) and basically start that over so I could assess things and give it a proper shot (not a good idea whatsoever). I did end up cutting things off and felt really bad about it all and wish I didn't put her through that. She was really nice about it at first and even was interested in being friends, but I think became upset about it later as she came into my work (bar) with a date, ignored me, and eventually unfollowed me on social media. I'm not upset that she did any of that, I just wish it ended better than it had. Anyways, so J had told me she worked a coffee shop (didnt give a name, i think on purpose) which was in the same area as the one X works/ worked at (not sure if she still works there). She also mentioned her really good friend which is a friend of X's as well that I did meet once when dating X. So I put two and two together and realized that it's definitely the same coffee shop. I also did some sleuthing and sure enough they follow each other on ig. So, I'm thinking before or after our next date I'm going to bring this up to her as I feel it would cause issues/ be awkward for that friend group which I don't want to intrude on. I would like to keep seeing J, but I'd rather get this settled right away before it goes any further. What do you guys think I should do?

TLDR (from chat gpt, i know I'm lazy):
A 25-year-old man went on a Hinge date with a woman, ""J,"" and realized she likely works at the same coffee shop as ""X,"" someone he briefly dated a year ago. That past relationship ended awkwardly after he asked to dial back intimacy and eventually broke things off, leaving him with some guilt. Now, discovering that J is likely part of the same friend group as X, he's unsure whether to continue seeing her without first addressing the connection. He wants to be upfront with J soon to avoid potential awkwardness or drama and is seeking advice on how to approach the situation.

1lzt0f2,https://i.redd.it/xyov9ah7mvcf1.png,Love After Heartbreak - My hands were both at noon on the steering wheel and I pressed my head to them while I sat at the red light.,"A strange text message on my phone caught my attention: Want to know what your man was doing while he was deployed? Or should I say \*who\* he was doing? Right after that, I received a video. Don't press play.......

# Chapter 1

My hands were both at noon on the steering wheel and I pressed my head to them while I sat at the red light. Just for a second I allowed myself to let go of the breath I'd been holding for what felt like months. Four more hours to get home and then my fianc's plane would be landing three hours after that, bringing him home for the first time in a year.

And what a year it'd been.

His deployment had seemed endless, and so much had happened while Padon had been gone. Life had been difficult here, but I knew it'd been even worse for him where he was, a highly volatile area that seemed ready to ignite at any moment. Every time we talked, I could see the stress etched into his face, and the last four months, it'd only gotten worse.

Between the time difference and my crazy work schedule, even finding opportunities to talk had been a challenge, and the conversations we did manage were sometimes difficult as I held back what had been going on with me. Guilt, sadness and anger made me stilted, and I wondered if I'd made the right decision to wait until he was home to tell him everything. But every time I saw his exhausted, tense face, I knew I needed to hold off and not add anything to his burden over there.

He was my person, had been since the moment we met, and I wouldn't do anything to endanger him. Had he known, Padon would have been stressing about what I was going through, possibly shifting his focus when he needed every bit of it for the job. All I wanted was to be able to talk with him and not worry for his safety. Feel his arms around me as I poured out everything that had occurred. Lifting my head from my hands, I moved them to my belly, still feeling the emptiness, the loss Padon hadn't even known about, the despair when my body hadn't been able to hold on to our precious child. Padon wouldn't know about the baby until I could tell him face-to-face, along with all of the other things that had happened.

Padon was the first person in my life I was fully invested in and he'd become my best friend and lover -- and what an incredible combination that was. For the first time in my life, I understood what making love meant. He made everything deeper, more meaningful, more beautiful. he was my connection to the world.

If I was being honest, he was the only real friend I'd ever had. Although I'd had friendships, it was more one-sided. I'd learn about my friends, but I always had my barriers up and didn't share much about myself. In essence, I was their friend but they weren't really mine; until Padon, no one knew the whole me. But with him, I'd readily given him all of me, every bit of knowledge about me that there was and he'd taken it and protected it, handling it with care. He'd shared everything with me as well. He let me in, told me the ugliest things about himself and saw I accepted every part of him just as easily as he accepted every part of me.

Being without him had been unbearable, and then, about six weeks after he left for his deployment, I'd discovered that our last night together had not only resulted in us becoming engaged but had also created a baby. Suddenly, I didn't feel so lonely. I had Padon's baby growing inside me, and although the pregnancy had happened ahead of our schedule, this baby was a welcome surprise, loved from the first moment I suspected.

From the start, it'd been a difficult pregnancy, and I'd had a number of scares, which reinforced my decision not to tell him about the baby. He'd only worry about both of us and get frustrated he wasn't there to take care of us. And when I'd had a stillbirth at six months, I'd borne that loss and pain alone, knowing he would lose his mind that he hadn't -- couldn't -- be there for me. It had been the darkest point of my life, and that darkness cast a long shadow. The loss was still curled around my heart, squeezing it so tightly at times that I was sure it would stop beating from the pain, leaving me gasping and trying to breathe.

No, Padon didn't need to experience that while he was deployed; he could join me in mourning when he returned and his life wasn't on the line every moment. I couldn't bear it if anything happened to him, too, especially if I was the one who caused him to lose focus.

I'd used the excuse of my work to limit our conversations, and when we did talk, I knew I wasn't my normal self with him, though I'd tried. That was the problem with knowing someone so well. Padon knew something was off. When he asked me what was wrong a number of times, I just used work, exhaustion and missing him as an excuse. And slowly, after about two months of me being distant, he became more distant, and he'd claimed work was getting more intense. For the last four months of his deployment, things had been tense between us on the phone, but I knew we'd get everything ironed out when he returned home. When he was safe.

My phone chimed just as the light turned green, and I knew it wasn't my fianc because he was still in the air for at least seven more hours. Thinking it might be one of my customers, I pulled into the nearest parking lot and parked. It was an unknown number, and I opened the text, thinking it could be a potential client.

The message chilled me, causing me to suck in so much air I had a coughing fit.

We women need to have one another's back. Want to know what your man was doing while he was deployed? Or should I say \*who\* he was doing? I just wanted you to know.

Then another text followed, but there wasn't a message. Just a video. A video that would turn out to be worth a thousand disgusting words.

Don't press play. Don't press play. My heart was begging me not to do it, but my head had taken the wheel.

Pressing play, I saw a beautiful brunette smiling into her camera. A topless, pretty brunette whose surgically-enhanced breasts left mine in the dust if we were having a competition for perkiness and size.

""God you are so good at that, Padon.""

Hit pause! Hit pause! Wait until Padon gets home and ask him to explain.

I had to let it play, feeling like I was going to get sick. He wouldn't have. There was just no way he would have cheated on me.

The camera turned to a man, his face between the woman's legs. Maybe it was a different Padon, but his hair color was the same and...oh, God help me, I knew those strong hands that were clamped around her thighs, holding her in place because he was that good at what he was doing.

""Smile for the camera, baby. I've got a month here all by myself before I get to go home and I'm going to need a reminder of you and all the delicious things you've been doing to me.""

He lifted his head and any hopes I had that it really wasn't Padon died along with anything else inside me that had survived the loss of my baby. He wasn't smiling and he was irritated.

""Put the camera away, Kayla.""

He even sounded annoyed.

Fumbling for the door handle and my seat belt release, I opened the car door and launched myself out seconds before I threw up until I had nothing left to give. After rinsing my mouth with water, I got back in the car, shaking, crying, nose gooey and dripping.

Then, as if pressing play hadn't been enough of a mistake, I compounded it.



# Chapter 2

Wiping my nose with the back of my hand, not even caring how gross it was, I texted back this mystery woman.

How long was this going on?

About four months

So he'd begun this after I'd lost our baby. The tears just kept coming, sobs bursting from deep within me, ripping and tearing through me like a chainsaw. Anyone passing by my car must have thought I had a wounded animal in here with all the howling and screaming erupting from me and they wouldn't have been wrong. I opened the car door again to get sick for the second time, barely able to keep from falling down on the ground I was shaking and shuddering so violently. All this time, all this time, I'd been worried about distracting him from his job and keeping him safe, while he was distracting himself by having an affair with no thought to me. I'd been suffering with the agony of losing our baby, trying to survive each day until he, my safe space, returned...and he'd been fucking another woman.

My mind was an absolute mess, and without thought, I proceeded to vomit again, only this time, it was word vomit as I texted back this stranger who had been decent enough to let me know what Padon was doing behind my back.

How could he do this to me? We just got engaged before he left for his deployment. He asked me to marry him! We bought a home together three months before that. We have a house and a mortgage! And I found out I was pregnant six weeks after he left and I didn't tell him because the pregnancy was rough and I didn't want to worry him. I didn't want him to lose his focus for one minute. Then I lost the baby at just six months and I didn't want to upset him because I knew he'd worry and he was in a dangerous place where his life was on the line. Why would he do this?

I hadn't thought things through very carefully. In my confusion and pain I'd poured all of that out to her. Did I say she'd been decent enough? I'd been very wrong about that.

Because in response to my oversharing text, she turned nasty, revealing her true self, and I could have kicked myself for my naivety in my moment of weakness and confusion. One after the other, her texts rolled in, each one finding a new insecurity of mine to exploit, each poison dart hitting the mark, her toxins spreading through me and paralyzing me with pain.

So, you failed to keep your baby alive. Like he needs a woman who can't even manage that simple task.

If you weren't so shitty in bed, he never would have turned to me. He needs me because I can give him what he wants in bed like you never could.

You have no idea what it takes to be with a military man of his caliber and keep him from finding someone better than you.

Face it. You're seven years older than he is which means he doesn't want your old ass any longer. Trading you in for the new, improved model. LOL

He'd told her about our age difference?

You don't do enough for him. You thought once you hooked him, you didn't need to put the work in, but, honey, you were so fucking wrong about that and now he's mine.

What on earth had he been telling her? I didn't do enough for him? I worked sixty hour weeks and my job required travel between four states. He'd never even hinted he wanted me to do things for him over and above what we already did for each other. And now he was telling her I didn't do enough?

He always laughed when I referred to you as the Fat, Ugly Bitch back home. After looking at your SM, I can see I wasn't wrong. Be prepared tonight when he asks to buy out your half of the house so I can move in when my deployment's over in a month. Bye bye, FUB.

For the third time, I was stumbling out of the car, but there wasn't anything left in me. I dry heaved so hard, I was sure my body was now trying to dispel my internal organs, and I had to brace myself on the hood of the car to stay upright. This...this vile creature was the reason he'd been so distant the last four months. I'd thought he'd just been horribly busy and stressed about work, or even responding to my distance, but no. He'd been cheating on me and making plans for a future with her in our home. No wonder he'd been distant.

Would these fucking tears ever stop? That just made me cry harder. I couldn't think, couldn't focus, couldn't do anything but choke on my tears.

I'd been working like a crazy woman on the house so Padon could come back to a home. After I'd lost our baby and recovered, I'd thrown myself into updating the house so I didn't have time to think about the baby and everything else that was going on. On the nights I wasn't out of state for work and on the weekends, I'd painted walls and cabinets, caulked, tiled the backsplashes, and had paid for laminate floors to be put in. I washed windows, hung light, breezy curtains and installed faux wooden blinds that I knew Padon preferred over Roman shades.

I started laughing hysterically when I realized my life had just been shredded and I was thinking about wooden blinds versus Roman shades. The laughing led to more tears and it took me a couple of hours to calm down so I wouldn't be a danger to anyone on the road. I still had four hours of driving ahead of me, a life to figure out and a murder to plan.

Well, not literally because felonies had a tendency to be forever. But it helped to envision revenge scenarios.

I needed to contact a lawyer to see how two unmarried people had to go about splitting up a house they jointly owned if one of them wanted to keep it. To see if I could prevent my former fianc from allowing the vile creature he'd cheated on me with from moving in until we'd figured out how to handle the house. To ask if the repairs and improvements I'd made were something that could be figured into the value of the house if he wanted to buy me out. To see if setting fire to the house could get me in trouble since it was half mine.

I wouldn't actually do that. Unless he was in it with her. Kidding. Kind of.

The dark humor was helping me get through the drive home. Halfway there, my phone started chiming, and I refused to look until I was back at the house because if she'd somehow gotten another number to call me from after I'd blocked her, I had no interest in whatever toxic shit she wanted to add to the hazmat pile she'd already dumped on me.

And if it was Padon, I was in no mood to talk with him yet. Fortunately, because of where he'd come from, there was a mandatory quarantine for the returning servicemen. That gave me a two week reprieve from having to see him, and I was thinking it would take that long to be able to speak to him without breaking down in tears. He may have broken me into little pieces, but I wouldn't let him see that.

He was the first person I'd allowed full access to my heart, and in the end, he hadn't cared. It hadn't mattered, I hadn't mattered, we hadn't mattered. His promises to me had turned out to be hollow words that crumbled into dust at the first opportunity.

I wouldn't forget this lesson. I wouldn't even bother trying to put all my broken pieces back together. I'd just erect barriers around them and no one would ever be let in again.



# Chapter 3

I made it home well after dark. Once I parked in the garage and turned off the car, I threw my head back and sighed, exhausted, thinking of all there was to be faced. Picking up my phone that I'd turned off when even the vibrating had gotten annoying with text after text and call after call, I debated turning it back on. Ultimately, I decided against it. I wasn't ready to face anything, especially at this hour, and I was feeling sufficiently numb, which meant I might be able to grab a few hours of sleep. The night before in the hotel, I hadn't slept much because I was so excited that Padon would be coming home today.

Even if I couldn't see him because of the quarantine, at least he was back and physically closer, out of danger. Two weeks would fly and then I'd finally be in his arms, pressed to his chest, able to tell him everything. He'd hold me, cry with me over our tiny boy, and we'd help each other through it. I'd delayed much of my grief so we could share it when he returned. Then, I could fill him in on other things that were going on and everything would be out in the open.

Turning on the phone could wait until tomorrow. I'd dealt with enough horror today. I walked into the house, enjoying the fresh, lemony scent that meant I was home. For a while longer, at least. I had no desire to stay in the house, and if Padon wanted to buy me out, I'd let him. And hide rotting fish all over the house right before I moved out. That I might actually do since I was fairly certain it didn't constitute a felony.

I got a glass of water and walked to the master bedroom before detouring to the guest bedroom. I'd decorated this room with soft, muted florals, pale yellow walls and bright white furniture I'd bought for practically nothing at a thrift store and painted myself. Almost as if I'd known I'd eventually be sleeping in here.

A knock on my front door scared the hell out of me. It was eleven o'clock and this neighborhood shut down by no later than ten. Hurrying to the door, I checked the peephole and opened it to my neighbor on the right.

""Sasha, are you OK?""

""I was making sure you were,"" she said. Sasha was in her mid sixties and had been very welcoming when Padon and I had moved in.

That was odd.

""Padon's been calling me,"" she explained, ""and I've been stopping by every hour or so. He said you weren't answering your phone and he was worried.""

Hadn't the vile creature filled him in so he'd know why I wasn't answering? Maybe the huge time difference had prevented her from getting in touch.

""Oh, my phone must have died when I was driving home and I didn't notice,"" I lied to her, feeling a twinge of guilt because she was so sweet. ""I'm so sorry he's been bothering you.""

""It's not a problem, hon. He was really worried, so I didn't mind checking in on you.""

I'm sure he was was worried, but not for the reasons you might think. If he knew his side piece had gotten to me, he was probably worried I was too busy burning his possessions to answer the phone.

""Thanks for checking, Sasha. I'll find my phone and charge it so this doesn't happen again.""

""I'm just glad you're OK, Adira. Have a good night.""

""You, too. Thanks again.""

I watched to make sure she got into her house, then closed the door. I needed to go to sleep and put this day behind me.

He was really worried. Bullshit. By now, he probably realized he'd been caught and wanted me to answer so we could discuss the situation calmly, like adults. Make sure I wasn't going to do anything crazy. Probably suggest that we be friends, like mature, rational people. Since I'd already (jokingly, I swear) thought of murder and arson and then dialed it back to smelly fish mischief, I wasn't sure I was mature and rational enough to discuss Padon cheating on me. With Kayla.

I trudged to the kitchen, made myself a cup of Sleepytime Extra tea that would knock me out, and sat on the couch while I drank it, trying not to think or hurt. For the record, I was unsuccessful at both.

Noticing my engagement ring, I twisted it off my finger, remembering how happy I'd been when Padon had slipped it on my finger the night before he left. He'd had his head on my stomach and all of a sudden there was a ring box there, too.

""I want you to marry me, Dira. Nothing I want more in life, no one I've ever loved like you.""

I'd opened the box, all power of speech fleeing. Never did I think I'd be engaged, but there was a ring in front of me and Padon's statements hanging between us. He reached in and held out the pretty diamond and emerald ring to me.

""Do you want to wear my ring?""

I nodded, my eyes watering, my mouth trembling as he slid the ring onto my finger.

""You're officially mine now, Dira. You've given me all of you, and that's the best gift I've ever been given. So now that you've said yes, just so you know, there are no takebacks.""

Then he made love to me and I knew that was when he'd given me our son. It'd been slow and beautiful, and he'd looked into my eyes the entire time. Unfortunately, he didn't honor the gift I'd given to him, and I couldn't keep the gift he'd given to me. We'd been on a collision course with heartbreak from that moment on while thinking our future held only beauty.

I was no longer Padon's, not anymore, and I sure as hell could do a takeback when he had given to some other woman what I'd thought was exclusively mine. I could feel the tears forming again and got frustrated with myself.

Stop it, Adira. Go to bed. Forget for a while. No more crying tonight.

Following my very wise advice, I went to bed. I slept somehow (thank you Sleepytime tea), and I woke up in the morning, enjoying that brief moment of amnesia before I became fully awake and the prior day's events hit me with a spiked bat several hundred times.

""It was real,"" I said out loud. ""Yesterday wasn't a dream.""

Since no one jumped out of the closet to contradict me, I had no choice but to accept that it was true.

I'd gone to bed with my phone beside me but turned off. I was afraid to turn it on and see the messages that had rolled in while I was refusing to engage with anyone with the names of Padon the cheating low-life dickhead or Kayla the vile creature bitch.

I got dressed, needing a hit of caffeine, and left the house. I saw Sasha out weeding her flowers as I backed down the driveway, and she waved me down. I rolled down my window as she came over.

""Adira, Padon called me this morning and said he was worried because he still hadn't been able to reach you.""

Dammit, Padon, quit making me lie to to Sasha.

""Oh, that's because I discovered my phone isn't working."" Technically the truth. A phone can't work if it's turned off. ""In fact, I'm heading to the phone store now.""

Also not technically a lie because it happened to be next to the coffee shop.

""At this hour? Are they even open?""

""I'm getting coffee first so I'll be right next door. You can just tell him I'll call him as soon as my phone gets fixed and to please stop bothering you.""

""He's just worried and so anxious to talk with you.""

""Awww,"" I said. I just bet he's anxious.

""Well, I'll see you later, Sasha! Thanks for letting me know.""

She waved and headed back to her weeding, while I took off. Once I got my coffee, I sat at an outside table and turned on my phone. It was time to face reality.

I’m 27 years old and a very harsh non-believer in anything supernatural. Don’t get me wrong, I love the supernatural in fantasy books, movies, and series but not in real life.

The past two days, I’ve been experiencing something odd going on inside my house. I live on the top floor of a four story apartment building. My significant other recently moved in with me and my parent about a week ago. Even though I like horror movies and similar content, I usually avoid watching them because they make me paranoid before bed. However, the last two days have been seriously unnerving.

Day One

I watched some “Scary Comp” videos on YouTube and then went to bed, after locking the door to get some peace of mind. For context, I have 3 dogs and 1 parrot in the apartment. My dogs love to bark when someone rings the bell, enters the house, or doesn’t give them attention and my parrot has been sick for two weeks now.

While in bed, in pitch black darkness, my youngest and middle dog suddenly started barking and the youngest began growling very loudly. Thinking they were barking at something from the balcony, I brushed it off and kept playing Mahjong on my phone to calm down and help myself fall asleep.

But within five seconds, I realized something chilling: the dogs weren’t barking outside. They were inside, barking directly toward the door that separates the living room from the rest of the house... the door closest to the front entrance.

I was skeptical at first, but then I heard a sound coming from the living room, like someone was using tools to open the front door. I’m not exaggerating. I jumped out of bed, rushed to the hallway, turned on the lights, and opened the door to the living room, only to be met by darkness and silence. The dogs stopped barking as soon as I passed their room and they saw me turn the lights on.

I quickly ran to the front door, checked the peephole while simultaneously flipping on the outside light. No one was there.

I turned everything off again and went back to bed, where my SO was still sleeping soundly. I resumed playing my game but this time with zero volume, staying alert.

Then something else happened: my parrot, who has been sick for two weeks and hasn't chirped or moved much (except for taking its medication), suddenly started shifting very softly in its cage... and then let out a chirp. My stomach dropped. I turned on the camera flash toward the cage, only to find the bird calmly sitting there—not alarmed or anything.

Dogs and birds are sensitive to noise, so I trust their instincts. But nothing about the situation explained what had just happened. All of it occurred within five minutes at 4:40 am.

Eventually, I went to sleep.

Day Two

I invited a friend over for coffee to catch up and plan some summer stuff. They stayed until the afternoon, just before my parent came back from work.

Later that day, I sat down to watch another Scary Comp—but this time I was looking for videos with more real-life cases: home invasions, camera footage, pictures of true events, that sort of thing.

About 40 minutes into watching, I paused for a bathroom break. When I returned, I played the next video while sitting on my couch in the living room.

Suddenly and I mean -firmly-the fake plastic plant I have (about 1.5 meters tall) was yanked sideways, about 10cm to the left. At the same exact moment, I heard a loud clack, like a switch being pressed.

I thought maybe one of the dogs had snuck through the baby gate, gone over to the plant, and knocked it somehow while playing around. But as I got up, a cold realization hit me...

All the dogs were still behind the baby fence. It was impossible for them to have come through unnoticed—especially since I know their patterns so well.

I got closer to the plant and looked around to see if something had fallen and knocked it over—but there was nothing out of place. Completely petrified, I backed slowly toward the living room door. I opened it and, like a normal grown man in denial, called out to my parent, as if they could help or do something.

In truth, I was so stunned I didn’t know what to do. What I got in return was the classic “Haha, you’ve been watching too many horror movies” reaction.

I was mad they didn’t believe me, but I went back to investigate. Nothing was toppled. Nothing was moved. My next instinct? One of those basic \* things you hear about like tossing salt over your shoulder.

\*And just now, as I’m typing this, my skin broke out in goosebumps and my keyboard started missing keystrokes. I meant to type “basic” just now, but it came out as “sic.”

OK, sorted that out by taking out and putting the battery back in. Maybe the keyboard is just malfunctioning for some random reason…

One more thing: I grabbed my bravest and smartest dog, pointed around, and asked him to ""find them"" you know, like “Who is it, boy?” But each time I said it, I felt this oppressive silence weighing down on me... and the dog just stared back, clueless.

Hopefully this was just some weird coincidence like one of those dolls that moves from air gaps or condensation or whatever.  
But honestly... I don’t know what to think anymore.

I've never actually posted here before, but I would really appreciate if anyone has any advice for my query below. It ends up being around 500-550 words when filled out. Thank you so much in advance. 

  
Dear \[agent\],

I am writing to you seeking representation for my 77,000-word contemporary adult fantasy novel, ALPHABET CATS.

\[Why agency/agent\]

CHARM is an indoor cat who knows nothing of the outside world nor her past. The odd things going on in Billee Grove – trees thriving without sunlight, meteors at the exact same time every year and cats galore going missing – are lost on her. She’s not alone. Though her owner, GEORGE, is aware of these events, he has no idea what to make of them – too focussed on legal documents trying to save Billee Grove Reserve from development by local business owner, WARREN ZITTY, to make sense of the world around him.

But when Charm is visited by a mysterious outdoor cat, she gets her chance to venture outside for the first time, witnessing firsthand the two fearsome cats taking over all the territories outside Billee Grove Reserve. And once told the man with the cigar stole a magic pendant that can transport cats anywhere – including a strange land called Taipou – Charm agrees to help get it back so the giant cats can be stopped and the displaced cats can return home.

Why would she agree to such a thing? Because it’s not any old cat who asked – it’s George’s previous cat he hasn’t seen for two years. And when Charm decides to help him break into the man with the cigar’s complex to retrieve the pendant, it’s not long before her twin brother agrees to join her – nor George’s sister's three cats on the other side of the underground tunnel of their adjoining cat houses.

When their mission fails, however, Charm has a choice to make. Stay inside and live a safe and comfortable life or take the risk and journey outside again. If there is any chance she is to recover her forgotten past, there is only one answer.

This story will appeal to readers who enjoyed *The Full Moon Coffee Shop* by Mai Mochizuki, *The House in the Cerulean Sea* by TJ Klune and *The Rainfall Market by* You Yeong-Gwang. And while it is about our relationship with nature, grief and identity, it is principally a story about memory – and any reader’s will need to be in fine fettle if they are to recall all the seemingly mundane clues and piece together this mystery before a bunch of cats.

A few weeks ago, I visited a large church on the West Coast where the priest began his homily by saying, “You know, some people complain that I get too political in these sermons and tell me that ‘Jesus wasn’t political.’ Well, if by that you mean he didn’t run for political office, then you’d be correct.” I honestly couldn’t pay attention to the rest of the homily, because I kept trying to decide whether the assertion that “Jesus was political” is meaningful at all, tuning in occasionally only to hear that the Gerasene demoniac was a “migrant refugee” or a bit of commentary on the bombing of Iran. As far as I could tell, the sermon had little to do with the day’s lectionary, and it was the least spiritually powerful part of the service. It also seemed to be firmly in line with the politics of the congregation.

By contrast, yesterday I was in a tiny parish in the Deep South. The priest expressed some reluctance about “getting political,” but said that it was unavoidable given the readings of the day:

* The prophet Amos being sent to the kingdom of Israel with a plumb line and a message that the kingdom was in danger of collapse; 
* Psalm 82 (“Save the weak and the orphan; defend the humble and needy; Rescue the weak and the poor; deliver them from the power of the wicked.”); and
* The parable of the Good Samaritan.

He said that he would be happy to discuss his sermon during coffee hour, but that he wasn’t interested in arguing (“I’m not very good at that”). He spoke about our societal failure to care for our neighbors, and he read from the Presiding Bishop’s recent [op ed](https://episcopalnewsservice.org/2025/07/03/presiding-bishop-once-the-church-of-presidents-the-episcopal-church-must-now-be-an-engine-of-resistance/).

This was my first time at that congregation, so I don’t know how they normally are. But it seemed *tense*, and I got the impression that the priest had ruffled feathers.

The contrast of those two services was striking, and just as I think it would be foolish to turn the Episcopal Church into “The Democratic Party at Prayer,” I think it’s also foolish to ignore Jesus’s ethical teachings that clearly ought to inform our political moment. What are we doing if we smell the incense and taste the wine and gaze at stained glass and listen to the story of the Good Samaritan but don’t spare a thought for the people our own government is rounding up into camps, the people who “fell among thieves” of our own make?",11,1752514481.0,Episcopalian,5,0.92,False

The Keurig K-Duo Special Edition Coffee Maker instantly caught my eye with its modern, sleek black finish and compact design. This machine fits effortlessly onto my cluttered kitchen counter without dominating the remaining space. That's not easy to find when it comes to appliances that handle both single-serve coffee and full carafes. With dimensions of 12.76"" depth, 10.94"" width, and 12.92"" height, it slips neatly into its corner without cramping my other essentials. The multi-position water reservoir is a thoughtful touch, giving me flexibility to position it on the left, right, or back to suit my countertop layout. It’s sturdy yet lightweight, weighing just around 1 pound, which makes relocating it a breeze during kitchen cleanups or rearrangements.

**Versatile Brewing Options**

The feature that sparks everyone’s interest—and rightly so—is its ability to brew both single servings via K-Cup pods and larger carafes with ground coffee. Sunday mornings call for a full carafe of freshly brewed coffee, perfect for sharing with friends. Weekday hustle? A quick single-serve cup gets me out the door with minimal hassle. I appreciate that the machine accommodates multiple brew sizes, allowing me to pick between 6, 8, 10, or 12 cups when brewing a carafe and equivalent single-cup ounces. The reusable coffee filter adds an eco-friendly angle to an otherwise pod-dominated market. Not buying separate filters? That’s a win.

[Grab Keurig K-Duo Special Edition price details on Amazon now.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07pc7mhq8/)

**Programmable Auto Brew**

One of the coolest features here is the programmable carafe auto brew. Setting the coffee maker the night before to brew at 6 a.m.? That’s game-changing comfort, especially as someone who gets cranky before their first cup. It allows me to wake up to the delicious aroma of freshly poured coffee. It’s a small joy—programming it up to 24 hours in advance—yet adds an immensely satisfying touch to my mornings. The pause-and-pour option was a lifesaver during brunch when my guests couldn’t possibly wait for the entire carafe to finish brewing.

**Strengths**

- Dual functionality for K-Cup pods and ground coffee.  
- Multi-position water reservoir adapts to kitchen layouts.  
- Easy-to-use programmable auto brew and smart start systems.

**Effortless Cleaning**

Maintenance and cleaning often make or break my experience with a coffee maker. Thankfully, this one keeps it simple. The machine has removable components, like the 60 oz shared water reservoir. That makes refilling and cleaning straightforward. I only wish it came with a digital clock display for additional convenience—admittedly a minor issue with an otherwise thoughtfully designed appliance.

**Less Favorable Aspects**

- A lack of a digital clock or display for programming might be a hurdle for some.
- The weight of the brewer is rather light, and while it feels stable, I’m extra cautious with larger water loads.

**Energy-Saving Features**

As someone big on energy efficiency, I found the Keurig K-Duo coffee maker’s auto-off functionalities to be an amazing upside. Whether it’s turning off the heating plate a couple of hours post-brew or shutting down completely five minutes after the last single cup, this feature leads to peace of mind—especially on hectic mornings when I tend to forget things. It’s a convenience bonus and an eco-conscious choice rolled into one.

**Alternative Offerings**

Compared to others like Ninja DualBrew or Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, this coffee maker stands out with its reusable coffee filter for carafes, a feature some models lack. Ninja DualBrew edges slightly ahead with its superior frothing and temperature control functionalities for more adventurous coffee drinkers, while Hamilton Beach often lands as the budget-friendlier alternative. If you’re looking for a no-nonsense, multi-purpose maker that balances cost and functionality, this one wins for simplicity.

**Financial Value**

Evaluating the cost-to-value ratio, I believe this machine retains its position as one of the better-balanced investments. It may not have features like a frother, but its reliability and versatile brewing modes carry significant weight. For those who value a programmable and easy-to-maintain appliance, its practicality easily outweighs comparable products.

Two snipers were hiding within the surrounding buildings, picking off every zombie that wandered into the streets below.

They probably were part of some newly formed survivor group that had banded together when shit hit the fan. And they weren't the first. North had encountered similar groups at every corner along his way, some were posted up defending their territory, others were out looking for food and supplies, and lastly there were crazies with big machine guns smoking everything on their way. 

It was a tough world outside, especially with murderous zombies roaming the streets who'd kill you in a blink. But this particular group was causing him problems as they were popping off every zombie that wandered into their kill zone. 

North adjusted his black sunglasses and turned up his headphones, trying to look like just another survivor on a scooter trying to get somewhere safe. The electric bike was perfect for moving fast without making noise, but it wouldn't help him if someone put a bullet through his skull. Still, the real issue wasn't his disguise - that was solid enough. The problem was that zombies didn't attack him, and eventually someone would notice that red flag. Most people were too stressed to pay attention to details, but shooters? They noticed everything. Several zombie corpses were scattered across the intersection, heads blown apart like watermelons. The snipers had good positions and clear sight lines. North couldn't even tell which building they were shooting from. He could try going around, but that would add hours to his trip and he was already running late for Dodger Stadium. He could try talking to them, but that was risky if they decided to test whether he was really human. Or he could just deal with the snipers directly, but that would definitely blow his cover. 

None of his options were great, but sitting here wasn't getting him anywhere. The longer he waited, the more time the aliens had to set up their next phase.

North rolled to a stop behind an overturned sedan. A lone zombie stumbled into the intersection ahead. The rifle crack echoed off concrete walls, and pink mist replaced the creature's head, and the body slumped on the road, twitching, but clearly not dead. 

To take a better look, he pulled back up his glasses and a HUD flickered to life across his vision... Back at Best Buy, he'd created a bunch of useful gadgets beyond just the forcefield disruptor - including surveillance equipment that could give him serious tactical advantages. He had a small swarm of spider drones patrolling the area, designed to alert him to any threats before they became problems. He diverted the swarm to search the surrounding buildings while their camera feeds streamed directly into his glasses. Soon, everything hidden in plain sight became visible: zombies stumbling behind closed doors, others stuck in tight spaces, and, more unexpectedly, people.

He furrowed his brow, unsettled. *Why are so many still here? By now, after the first wave of freezing, most should’ve found a way out, or at least regrouped with other survivors. Had they been overlooked? Or simply too afraid to move?*

*Maybe the survivor crews haven’t swept the whole area yet…* he thought grimly. *Even if I wanted to help, where would I send them? The streets are still crawling with infected. It’s suicide out there…*

…

""Oh shit, did you see that? That motherfucker just turned into mist! Haha, this is so much fun,"" came a voice through his audio surveillance. One of the snipers had pulled back from his window position, talking to his partner over the radio. 

“They’re like cockroaches, man. You shoot one in the chest, and it just... evaporates. But it’s *still* dragging itself with its arms. You seeing this?”

His friend on line, Nick, chimed in. “My turn next. There’s another one coming up the street. Think I can blow off all four limbs and see if it still crawls?”

“You know what really gets me?” Derrick said after a moment. “I don’t gotta go to work tomorrow. No more bills. No more student loans, haha. This apocalypse shit is actually kinda... freeing, man.”

Nick chuckled. “You’re deranged.”

“I’m honest.”

After thirty-five minutes of surveillance, North finally had the location pinned down. One shooter was holed up in his apartment on the 16th floor, which was packed with enough groceries to survive two or three months without stepping outside. They were apparently enjoying their newfound freedom from normal society.

“I’m just worried about my girl,” Nick said suddenly

Darrick groaned, ""Why are we still talking about her? “We already looked once, and she’s probably dead. And even if she’s not, you going out there isn’t gonna help anyone. You step outside, you don’t come back. End of story.”

""I know, but I just can't stop thinking about her, man.""

“You know…” Derrick set his sniper rifle down on a folded towel near the window, then leaned back in his chair with a long sigh. “I’ve been thinking about something.”

“What’s that?” Nick asked, chewing on something that sounded like a granola bar from the crinkle in the audio feed.

“We should start looking for other people in the building. Make a group or whatever.”

Nick made a dismissive noise. “You just want more mouths to feed? We barely have enough for two. That’s a hard pass.”

Derrick chuckled under his breath. “Nah, you’re not thinking about it the right way. I’m not talking about just *anyone*.”

“I mean, specifically women. Think about it. We’ve got food, water, weapons, and real protection. There’s gotta be a few people holed up alone and scared. You offer 'em safety, some stability…” He laughed under his breath. “Most wouldn’t say no.”

There was a long silence over the radio.

Nick’s voice came back, “Dude. That sounds… I dunno. Creepy as hell. Like some end-of-the-world cult leader shit.”

“It’s survival,” Derrick said simply. “You think the world’s gonna go back to normal? You think Tinder’s coming back online anytime soon?”

“You’re not *seriously* talking about rounding up women like they’re resources,” Nick said tensely. “That’s messed up.”

“I’m just saying,” Derrick replied in an easy tone. “People want safety. We have it. It’s simple math.”

Nick didn’t answer.

“Whatever,” Derrick went on. “It was just a thought.”

Then Nick changed the topic, “That repeating radio message has been on loop all morning. The one talking about ‘superpowers’ and evolved zombies and all that. Do you think any of that’s real?” Nick asked.

“I don’t know. Maybe,” Derrick said after a thought. “Crazy times make crazy things sound a lot more possible. I wouldn’t rule out some kind of mutation crap going on. We’ve barely seen anything outside this damn window since day three.”

“You think super zombies?”

“I mean there might be some truth to his words. Those fast ones yesterday didn’t move like the first batch. You saw it too. So, who knows? There might already be super zombies running around...""

North listened to their conversation while studying the building layout through his drone feeds. These weren't trained soldiers - just two guys with rifles who'd gotten lucky enough to secure a good position. Either way, he was getting tired of listening to their casual discussion about exploiting vulnerable women during the apocalypse.

The obvious choice would've been to eliminate them before these freaks did something unforgivable, but they weren't the first ones with these thoughts and certainly wouldn't be the last. So North handed a couple of blast grenades to his backup swarm of spider drones and sent them up to their floor.

""The biggest reason I'm conflicted about that transmission is because both you and I have seen these zombies eat so many people, but did you see any zombie with superpowers? So I'm calling bullshit, it might all be a hoax,"" Nick said.

""Yeah, maybe. We've shot so many zombies on the road, yet none of them had anything super about them.""

*BOOM! BOOM!*

Suddenly, the entire floor rumbled violently and Derrick jumped off his bed in terror. ""Ah, Jesus… what the hell was that?” 

He leapt off the bed while scrambling to grab his sniper rifle and cautiously made his way toward his apartment door. Outside in the hallway, a small hole had been blasted open in the ceiling of the floor above, causing several wandering zombies to start falling down into the lower level. At the same time, two more grenades exploded at the stairwell, completely cutting off their escape route.

""What the fuck is happening?"" Nick's panicked voice crackled through the radio. ""I can hear zombies in the hallway!""

""I don't know, man! The ceiling just exploded and now there's zombies everywhere!"" Derrick was freaking out as he peered through his door's peephole.

Meanwhile, North calmly adjusted his headphones and started up his electric scooter before rolling through the intersection at a leisurely pace. Both Derrick and Nick were completely losing their shit in their respective apartments. But that wasn't North's problem anymore, especially what happened to them next… they'd be scared and paranoid, and Derrick could only hope he'd find a way off his floor to hurt people.

…

Every corner of the city was burning. Thick smoke rose from shattered buildings like funeral pyres, turning the sky an ugly orange-brown. 

North passed an ice cream shop where three scavengers had barricaded themselves inside while a horde of twenty zombies pressed against the glass door. The survivors looked like they'd been looting for supplies when they'd somehow attracted attention. Now they were one cracked window away from becoming zombie chow. Spider web fractures spread across the glass as rotting fists pounded against it. 

North didn't slow his scooter. He pulled his toy gun and spun the cylinder to the acid bombs.

*Pop.*

The grenade landed right in the middle of the horde. Yellow gas immediately engulfed the mass of undead, and the zombies stopped their assault on the door. They growled in confusion as their feet began dissolving beneath them, dropping them face-first onto the sidewalk. Within two minutes, all that remained was a steaming puddle of liquefied flesh and bone.

The three survivors inside pressed their faces to the window in shock, but North had already vanished around the corner.

*GRrrr! GRrrr!*

He'd just passed two intersections when the ground started to tremble. A deafening roar came from ahead, and North immediately stopped, ditching his scooter behind an overturned sedan.

A monster truck came barreling down the street at full speed, its massive tires crushing cars and zombies alike in its path. Black smoke poured from twin exhaust stacks as the engine screamed. There were two guys standing in the truck bed with automatic rifles, firing at everything that moved on the road. They were whooping and hollering like they were having the time of their lives.

The monster truck plowed through a cluster of zombies, turning them into red paste smeared across the asphalt. It clipped a minivan and sent it spinning into a storefront with a tremendous crash. Glass exploded outward as the building's front wall collapsed.

North waited until the monster truck passed before jumping back on his scooter and continuing toward his destination, weaving between abandoned cars and zombie clusters. 

A few blocks ahead, he spotted a group of survivors on a rooftop frantically waving a white sheet at a helicopter circling overhead. The chopper was too high to see the massive horde of zombies gathering below their building, drawn by all the noise. North sent two of his spider drones crawling up the building walls and had them detonate their small charges near the zombies' feet. The loud bangs scattered the horde in different directions, clearing a path for when the helicopter eventually landed.

The survivors never knew why the zombies suddenly wandered away.

Some distance later, a family of four had climbed onto the roof of a gas station, surrounded by a dozen zombies that had figured out how to climb the ladder. The father was swinging a crowbar while his wife shielded two young kids behind her. North lobbed a chemical grenade into the crowd below. As the yellow gas spread, the zombies collapsed into bubbling soup, and the family stared down in bewilderment at their sudden salvation. He was already three blocks away before they could spot him. 

Near a shopping mall, North watched another small group trying to sneak past a group of zombies using shopping carts as shields. It wasn't working - the zombies were slowly surrounding them. North fired a shock grenade at a nearby car alarm, and the blaring sound drew all the zombies away from the survivor group toward the noise. By the time he drove past, the group was safely inside the mall.

Then, he had to duck behind an overturned bus when a convoy of military vehicles rolled through, soldiers hanging out the windows with flamethrowers, torching everything that moved. These guys weren't taking chances - they'd probably shoot him on sight just for being outside during daylight. North waited until their diesel engines faded before continuing.

At a coffee shop, he spotted three college-aged kids trapped on the second floor while zombies had taken over the ground level. North didn't even slow down, just tossed a shock grenade through the front window as he rode past. By the time the blue snakes of electricity cleared, the kids would have a clear path to escape.

The pattern continued for blocks. A mother and baby cornered in an alley got an unexpected assist when the zombies chasing them suddenly melted into goo. An elderly man barricaded in his car watched in amazement as the undead surrounding him simply... fell to the ground, twitching.

North never stopped, never made contact, never let anyone get a good look at him. He was a ghost leaving trails of inexplicably dead zombies in his wake. 

But when he spotted the armored personnel carrier rolling down a parallel street, complete with mounted machine gun and actual military markings, he took a hard left and disappeared into the maze of side streets. Some groups were better left alone entirely.

Being helpful was one thing. Being stupid was another.

Finally, Dodger Stadium came into view through the smoke and haze. North brought his scooter to a halt at the entrance and stared at the massive parking lot spread out before him. Thousands of abandoned cars sat in neat rows, some burning. Zombies wandered between the vehicles like lost shoppers, bumping into car doors and stumbling over concrete barriers.

A visible shimmer surrounded the entire stadium like a soap bubble, rippling whenever something pressed against it. Right now it was mostly zombies crashing into the forcefield over and over, too stupid to understand why they couldn't get through.

The military had sealed off a small area around the forcefield. Tall metal fencing topped with razor wire formed an outer ring, with armed personnel stationed every fifty yards. Armored vehicles sat at strategic chokepoints, their machine guns trained outward to mow down any zombie hordes that got too close.  But the real activity was happening closer to the stadium. Scientists in hazmat suits moved in and out of research vans, carrying strange devices that beeped and hummed as they took readings on the energy field. Some kind of scanning equipment, probably trying to figure out how the alien technology worked.

*Fucking aliens,* North muttered*.*

He parked his scooter behind an overturned hot dog cart and shouldered his equipment bags. Pulling down his HUD, he sent his spider drones to scout the perimeter, getting a better look at the military setup. Guard rotations, equipment positions, weak spots in their coverage. As expected, the scientists were absorbed in their instruments, paying little attention to their surroundings. All he had to do was stay off the soldiers’ radar to slip in unnoticed.

Ultimately, North looped around and took the opposite entrance, bypassing them completely.",2,1752514333.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

1lzso2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lzso2h/my_weekend_binging_alcoholic_husband30m_has/,My Weekend Binging Alcoholic Husband(30M) has Relapsed Twice... I'm(28F) at a breaking point.,"Hi reddit. My husband (30M) and I (28F) have been together for 8 years, married for 3. We own a house together, no kids, a cat and a dog.

My husband and I were always drinkers. We met at a party when I was 18, started a long distance relationship when I was 21 commuting 2 hours back and forth to see each other on the weekends. Most of the time we would meet up with friends and go out to bars or parties, always drinking. After two years of that we moved in together, which brought its own challenges of learning how to live together. We would drink every weekend, hang out with friends, go to breweries, something always involved drinking. That life style followed us when we bought a home together. Always drinking on the weekend.

For me, that started to stop about a year ago. After my sisters baby shower, my family sat down with my husband and I and called attention to our drinking. They said it was worrisome, that I (me) was having to chase my husband around with water that he refused to drink.  They said it was time to grow up, that people shouldn't have to babysit other adults.

I really took that advice to heart, I didn't want to be a sloppy person. I'd been wanting to try out a sober lifestyle, really figure out what I like to do. I felt like my entire identity was drinking, it was scary to know that but also scary to try and figure out who I was.

Fast forward to 6 months ago, my husbands drinking started getting out of control. I had tried to stop drinking at this point, tried to convince him to take a break with me. He would agree but then would show up with a case of something on the weekends. But then he started drinking later on sundays, started calling out of work on monday's. At that point I made a rule, no more drinking. Then he started sneaking it. Drinking liquor when he wasn't even a big liquor drinker. At one point he took all of the liquor bottles in the house and smashed them on the patio outside. He would lie, and hide, and sneak. I lost all trust in him.

Other times he would be so intoxicated I would take his keys and lock myself in the bedroom, because he was prone to drinking and driving. The last time that happened I called the cops, because he was trying to break the door down and I was really scared. After that time, my family and I had an intervention with his mother and him, and he agreed to go to a 30 day in patient rehabilitation center. That was in May.

That month was really hard for me, our house literally tried to fall apart, I had to manage everything. I kept the house chaos from him until he got back from rehab so that he could focus on healing and himself. He understood when I told him and seemed grateful. I really did a lot of growing that month, I had been sober myself for about a month at that point, I was losing weight, I realized how strong of a person I am, and I found some peace in my home after months of being in survival mode. I found peace in solitude.

I was nervous for him to come home, I felt like a different person, I still do. He said he was a different person, too. But things were good when He got back, he had already hit 30 days in rehab, and then we made it to 60. He was going to IOP 3 days a week, and had an individual therapist. He was also going to AA meetings on saturdays and sundays. He had a sponsor. Things were looking good at 60 days.

Then we hit 65, this was two weeks ago. We'd had a beautiful saturday, going to a farmers market, drinking coffee, just a slow easy day together. We were working on a puzzle (something we both find joy in) when I finally succumbed to my instincts and asked him if he had been drinking. I had started to notice something was off earlier in the afternoon, but brushed it off - because we were at 65 days, id been with him the whole day - there was no way, right? Wrong. He had gone to the market to get propane and in that 15 minute timespan had gotten 2 tall boys and chugged them on the way home.

It sucked. And he lied, did the normal ""you think i've been drinking alcohol?"" told me the breathalyzer was wrong (even when I blew it and got 0.00 reading). I wasn't even that upset over the slip, its the lying that gets me. That breaks me. But I managed. i didn't freak out, I called my dad for support and then got him to call his sponsor. We slept in different rooms for the week but came back together and talked about it, and last weekend he started sleeping in the room again. We established a ""natural consequence"" of lying is sleeping in separate rooms for a week.

Last weekend was pretty good, we went floating on the river for the fourth, did some yard work that we enjoy and had some good dinners. The following week was tough, he was stressed out from work and we got in an argument on wednesday and he went to sleep in the spare. I'm always the one who resolves our fights, who initiates the fixing. This time I didn't. Come saturday and I'd gone to pilates in the morning and was at lowes looking for stuff to plant, because in my sobriety and finding myself i've found I really love to garden. He showed up at lowes, told me in AA they had talked about humility and he knew he was terrible at humility. Told me he was sorry for the week, that he loves me. It meant a lot that he showed up. We finished shopping at lowes and had a fantastic day together.

Now yesterday. We woke up early and had a slow morning, sitting on our deck drinking coffee and tea listening to the morning nature sounds of birds and cicadas. Laughing - a lot of laughing. We made a full breakfast, we had a plan to go to the pool in the afternoon after he got done with AA.

I work on homework while hes gone (i'm in a masters program online). he comes home and we leave for the pool around 1 and return around 330. I have some homework to finish up so I go and start working on that. We have a plan to make dinner around 6 and he's planning to finally call his younger brother and tell him about his drinking problem and how he went to rehab. I'm feeling good, like we are breaking through, like he's waking up and growing and seeing it.

Then I get that feeling, that something is off with him. He's acting restless, keeps forgetting what we're planning to make for dinner. I let it slip, just once. But it rears up again when he tells me his sponsor wants to mee to give him some AA books, we pick a meeting spot for them. Then maybe 5 minutes later he asks ""would you hate me if I went to the gym right now?"" and thats when I tell him he's acting off, that he's supposed to meet his sponsor at 530 and then call his brother at 630 and we were going to make dinner while he did that. That there wasn't time for the gym with all of that. I ask him if he'll breathalyze, and he starts making faces. He finally does, and tries to ""fake blow"" the breathalyzer. It still comes back a 0.14. He tells me its wrong, so I blow it and its a 0.00. he does it again, reads a 0.15. Then the classic ""you think i've been drinking alcohol?"" comes out. After 10 painful minutes of begging him to just be honest, the truth comes out:

immediately after AA at 11am he crossed the street and allegedly bought two tallboy 9.5% beers. He allegedly had one before we left for the pool. He drove, so he drove me drunk without my knowledge. When we got back he started the second and had just finished it. His plan to meet with his sponsor was a facade. He had change his own contact information in his phone to be his sponsor and was texting himself to make it look like a conversation was happening with his sponsor. This was all so he could go to the meeting spot (a gas station) to buy more beer.

Some of you might say  ""how did you not know"" and I really don't know. I'm finely tuned into his behavior when he starts drinking, I know that. But I think the morning had been so beautiful, and I was focused on school, it was a beautiful day and I wasn't looking out for the signs he exhibits when he starts drinking. So I just don't' know how I missed them prior to the pool.

My point in all of this is to ask, what the hell do I do now? I'm tired. I've tried, literally everything, to keep our marriage together. To support him, to encourage him, and I just keep getting bitched slapped. I don't think he's taking it seriously, I can't even confirm if hes going to AA or just sitting in a parking lot. Hes been given books, apps, support groups. Activities, engaging hobbies, things to fill up his time. He's not physically addicted to alcohol. Mentally? Maybe, sure I don't know. but i'm struggling to believe that someone who was invested in their healing would go to AA and then immediately walk to the store and get beer. That someone would actively make a plan. These ""slips"" as he calls them, haven't been emotionally induced, there wasn't some major or even minor triggering event that set him off into stress and he couldn't handle it. He wasn't pressured. He has so many people standing behind him, saying call me if you need help. Call me when you get an urge. He has a sponsor. but he doesn't pick up the phone.

I love him, but I want to leave. But I also don't want to, but I don't think he's trying and I have an awful gut feeling he's not going to change. when is enough, enough?",1,1752514070.0,relationship_advice,10,0.67,False

What do I (21F) need to do,"Hey all! I need advice and help with a rental situation. I signed a lease with 4 other people I met through FB marketplace and it has been a terrible fit. It was a very hasty decision, but I didn’t have many options at the time of signing. I’ve since found a cheaper place closer to my school’s campus and want to move by next month. However, my landlord has been ignoring my messages, not just about this but also a text on behalf of my other roommates about the sewer bill. Calling him went straight to voicemail. What should I do?


Also here’s why I’m moving for context, idk if this is just normal roommate squabble and I should get over it but my last living situation was way more chill:

Couple in the house are involved in age play and it makes me extremely uncomfortable. I was not aware of this having only met them once before moving in, but in a few months both of them shown that this is a lifestyle for them and I’m absolutely not okay with sharing a living space with people who do that so openly. they clearly can’t just keep it in the bedroom. I’ve worked with kids as a teacher, and have close friends who experienced csa, and the things theyve been saying and doing are actually making me sick to my stomach and I have a hard time being civil with them because of it.

Other roommate has 7 parakeets in the communal space that squawk ALL DAY very loudly. Due to the volume and acoustics I can hear them from my room, with the door closed with ear plugs in. I’ve gotten somewhat used to it but it is extremely annoying. This roommate also has complained to me about sounds I make in the kitchen in the morning (I wake up at 6am for classes and am mindful, but make my coffee/ breakfast early) and about sounds from when I get home later (10-11 pm) or have guests over… I really wouldn’t mind the bird sounds if she wasn’t the one making these requests that I be quieter. She also has two dogs that bark, jump up on and occasionally bite guests.

Other roommate is an older guy I share a bathroom with and for the most part he’s a chiller. I found out recently he was using my towels tho which was really gross. I literally have extras he could use if he asked but he just used mine??? I feel really gross and idk. I’m just so done.

And... my mother, the esteemed Mrs. Kim Jeong-hee, has hands that can bypass any defense.

What are you doing you two. she asked. Clenching her fist. In her other hand was a ladle. Sensing the gravity of the situation. I quickly spoke up.

Ma'am. I think you forgot. But today is your son's birthday.

So.

It means I'm almost thirty. Isn't it a bit much to hit me in front of others.

I'm turning sixty the day after tomorrow.

Oh. Uh...

I had miscalculated.

Acknowledging my mistake deep down. I changed the direction of the conversation.

A couple of months ago. I had a fierce battle with a monster.

I'm just glad you came back safely son.

Thank you Mother.

But why are you fighting with your sister who's eight years younger than you instead of a monster.

Mother. I don't fight with people. Therefore. That is not my sister but a monster.

So you're saying I gave birth to a monster.

Palm or ladle. Which do you prefer.

Cornered. I realized there was no escape and answered with my eyes closed.

Palm.

Arm or back.

I'll take the back.

After careful consideration. My answer was met with immediate retribution.

Mom said. *Smack!*

Not to fight. *Smack!*

I told you. *Smack!*

Ah. Ouch. Is this the Flame God Palm.

The searing pain on my back made both Hayeon and me scream.

Even the perfect body known as Cheonmu Jiche in Murim was useless at this moment. This was fear and pain engraved into the soul.

There's no avoiding it.

If I tried to dodge. I'd be guilty of disrespect and face ten times the punishment.

In the end. Hayeon and I were only released after receiving Mom's handprint on our backs. As we gasped for breath. Team Leader Choi and the Skeleton King's eyes widened in shock as they watched Mrs. Kim Jeong-hee walk away.

M-Mother. I was trying to stop them.

A-Ah. I'm American. United States citizen. Don't touch. Please.

Their desperate attempts to save themselves were almost pitiful.

Of course. Mrs. Kim Jeong-hee smiled warmly as if nothing had happened.

Hoho. My kids were a bit naughty. I'm sorry. They're still immature. I'm making breakfast. So please join us.

Th-Thank you.

Thank you Jeong-hee.

What the hell you bastard.

If nothing else. Thank you Jeong-hee was a death sentence.

I shot a murderous glare at the Skeleton King and headed to the dining room.

The distance to the dining room was considerable befitting a grand mansion. But with the elevator and short-distance Teleport magic circle installed inside. It was quick.

No. Come to think of it. This is ridiculous. How is there a Teleport magic circle inside the mansion.

Looking at Team Leader Choi with a bewildered expression. He answered calmly.

The mansion is quite large. I believe it was installed to reduce travel time.

…That's usually what a Teleport magic circle is for. Naturally.

Eating is to fill your stomach. I didn't see how this was any different.

Then again. It might be perfectly normal for Team Leader Choi.

This is worlds apart from an ordinary household. Even the third-generation chaebols of South Korea and the youngest sons of renowned swordsmanship families would have to bow to him.

His grandfather was the immortal hero who defeated the Demon King Asmodeus in the final battle and saved humanity.

Cheon Taemin.

If the birth of a prophet once divided history into before and after. Cheon Taemin determined the fate of humanity.

Millions saw him. And hundreds of millions remember him.

The vast amount of data proving his existence would remain until the day humanity faced its end.

And to think that Cheon Taemin once lived in this mansion. Even though Team Leader Choi. His grandson. Didn't know his whereabouts or whether he was alive. It was still awe-inspiring.

Despite temporarily staying here due to the persistent media. It felt special to share the same space as the immortal hero Cheon Taemin.

This is amazing. Looking at the mansion. Which was powered by the highly valuable A-grade magic stones embedded like batteries. I took a deep breath.

Hoo.

Team Leader Choi looked at me with a puzzled expression.

…What are you doing.

Trying to absorb the energy. Or maybe feel the hero's aura.

Hayeon. Rubbing her sore back. Muttered.

He's just a pervert. He has a smell fetish.

Shut up. You insolent woman.

Really. Um... mmph.

If you don't want to get killed tonight. Keep your mouth shut. I'm almost thirty now. And I don't want to get hit in front of others anymore.

Fortunately. Just before Mrs. Kim Jeong-hee turned around sensing something odd. Someone appeared.

Good morning.

A smooth deep voice that could automatically play in a coffee commercial. Despite the early morning. Butler Kim approached with perfectly styled pomade hair and a neat sophisticated custom suit.

He walked neither too fast nor too slow. First bowing to Team Leader Choi.

Did you have a restful night young master.

Team Leader Choi nodded familiarly.

Yes. I had a few things to take care of. So I went to bed a bit late. But I'm fine.

It's because of the proposal from Mr. Johnson's side isn't it.

Yes. There were some adjustments needed in the contract with the Wizard Guild. I've sorted it out. So...

Listening to their conversation. Hayeon muttered.

Is this a scene from a drama or what.

It's not a drama. If anything. It's more like a web novel.

If it were a webtoon. Maybe. Making this kind of fantasy into a drama would cost a fortune.

Just let it go. You'll get used to it eventually.

That.

...At least try to get used to it.

To be honest. It still drives me crazy every time.

If you think about it. Just half a year ago in modern times. I was an F-rank Hunter surviving on blood sausage soup and instant noodles.

The media now hails me as the new hero following in Cheon Taemin's footsteps. And in my old worn-out leather wallet. There's an S-Class Hunter license made from a specially processed top-grade magic stone.

I should be getting used to this by now. But it's surprisingly hard.

Maybe it's because I still have so much to do.

Juggling between the modern world and Murim. Constantly dealing with one incident after another. It's overwhelming.

Perhaps it would be stranger if I fully embraced and got used to the wealth and fame bestowed upon me.

It's better to discuss the details after breakfast young master.

Ah yes. Let's do that.

Following Team Leader Choi and Butler Kim who had just finished their brief conversation. We headed to the dining room.

No. Calling it a dining room doesn't do it justice. It was more like a banquet hall.

It was spacious elegant and equipped with advanced AI robots waiting at their designated spots.

But in this meticulously prepared space. There was one thing missing.

Huh.

Of course.

Everyone except Hayeon and me blinked in surprise. Especially the Skeleton King. Whose whisper was filled with pure curiosity.

Wicked human. May I ask you something.

Speak.

I was told we were to eat. But why is there nothing on the table.

The Skeleton King was right. The large table in the center of the banquet hall was completely empty. No utensils. No food—just a blank slate.

Having anticipated this. I quietly nodded.

This is how it is.

What.

It's an absolute rule. Or maybe a racial trait. Something like that.

When my mom calls us to eat. It means she's still preparing.

Whether she calls us once or ten times. The result is the same when we get there.

Knowing this well. Hayeon was already looking for utensils.

Excuse me. Where are the spoons and chopsticks.

Pardon.

Spoons and chopsticks.

Team Leader Choi blinked silently and then slowly turned his gaze towards someone.

Butler Kim.

In that moment. A single hair popped out of Butler Kim's perfectly styled pomade.

Everything is programmed into the robots' circuits. So they should bring everything... But why aren't they moving.

Just then. Mrs. Kim Jeong-hee. Who had rushed to the kitchen with a ladle saying the soup was boiling. Poked her head out.

Oh my. I turned off the power.

Oh. What.

Yes.

I'm already imposing on you. And I didn't want to waste electricity. The kids can handle it quickly. So please take a seat.

Of course. Mrs. Kim Jeong-hee wouldn't hear that all the robots in the mansion run on embedded magic stones. Not electricity. And that there's no need to save on electric bills.

She was a professional homemaker who had raised two children with a tight budget all her life.

As everyone stared at me. Speechless. I could only smack my lips.

Just let it be. I've tried to explain it a few times. But it never works.

My mother. Who had saved up all the living expenses I sent her. Always wondered how to spend the money.

Remembering her working in a restaurant. I smiled bitterly and smacked the back of the Skeleton King's head.

Smack.

Why...

What are you doing you idiot. Go help.

Wicked human. This is unfair. This isn't even American.

Then go to the United States. You'll be caught as a monster and dragged to the Octagon as soon as you arrive.

Team Leader Choi looked at me with astonished eyes.

It's the Pentagon Jin Taekyung...

Octagon Pentagon whatever. Team Leader Choi and Butler Kim. You should help too.

What.

It's a meal we share together. We should all prepare it together.

For a moment. Team Leader Choi's eyes wavered.

A meal we share... together.

You heard me right. Now go set the table. I'll be watching to make sure you do it properly.

Team Leader Choi's eyes. Which had wavered for a moment. Became clear again.

Watching.

Yes.

Then what about you Jin Taekyung. Are you not doing anything.

It's my birthday today. At the Hunter Training Center. They gave us free time on our birthdays.

What are you doing. We need to prepare before the seaweed soup is ready.

Even though I had been thoroughly excluded by Lee Jeongryong after my parents passed away and my grandfather Cheon Taemin disappeared. I was still a young master from a noble family.

For Team Leader Choi. This must have been an experience he had never encountered in his life.

Watching him and Butler Kim walk away with a bewildered look. I chuckled and sat down. Pulling out my smartphone.

There's nothing like the news to understand the situation.

After a few taps. I logged into a large community exclusive to Hunters and paused as I saw an article posted just ten minutes ago.

\[Former Ares Deputy Guild Leader Lee Jeongryong (68) to have a state funeral tomorrow\]

\[Where is the Immortal Hero Cheon Taemin?\]

The thing is, aside sa reason na birthday nya, Di ko na nakikita sarili ko in the next days, weeks or months. Di ko na alam kung kelan. I've been struggling with my mental health. I'm really so tired. (Reasons why MIA ako)

I just really need to get this off my chest. Pls wag nyo na ilabas to sa reddit.

The Monster I Once Loved

I was just a struggling artist in Brooklyn, and he was the amnesiac I found beaten in an alley - just ""Alex.""
We fell deeply in love, building a life on whispered dreams and cheap coffee, a bond that felt truly unbreakable.
But then his memory returned, and my gentle Alex vanished, replaced by Alexander Sterling III, a cold, ruthless heir.

He discarded me like tr**h, his mother paid me off to disappear, and his cruel world, with his chillingly silent consent, shattered my artist's hand.

I watched the man I loved stand by as they destroyed me, wondering how a heart could turn so utterly indifferent.

Broken but not defeated, I used the 'hush money' to rebuild myself in Paris, emerging five years later as a renowned sculptor, alongside a man who truly cherished me.

My renewed happiness, however, ignited a terrifying obsession in Alex, unleashing a horrifying wave of vengeance on everyone he perceived to have wronged me--or so he twistedly claimed.

He thought this brutal ""justice"" would finally win me back, but all it revealed was the true, monstrous stranger the man I loved had become.


Chapter 1
Eleanor Sterling sat across from Maya in the opulent penthouse living room.

The air was cold, despite the late spring sunshine pouring through the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Eleanor's smile did not reach her eyes.

She pushed a check across the polished mahogany table.

""Five million dollars, Miss Rodriguez.""

Her voice was smooth, like expensive silk.

""For you to disappear from Alex's life. Leave the country. Permanently.""

Eleanor's gaze swept over Maya's simple dress, a silent judgment.

""He has a certain... image to maintain. You understand.""

Maya looked at the check. The number had many zeros.

It was more money than she had ever imagined.

She felt a hollowness inside, a quiet ache.

She met Eleanor's expectant gaze.

""Okay.""

Eleanor's perfectly sculpted eyebrow rose a fraction.

She had expected tears, arguments, perhaps a demand for more.

Maya's calm acceptance was unsettling.

""You'll sign a non-disclosure, of course.""

""Of course."" Maya's voice was flat.

Later, Maya walked through the silent penthouse.

It was vast, cold, filled with things that were not hers.

She picked up a framed photo from a side table.

It was her and Alex, taken months ago in their tiny Brooklyn apartment.

His arm was around her, his smile wide and genuine.

The Alex in the photo was gone.

The memory of him, however, was vivid.

Rain lashed against the grimy window of Maya's old Brooklyn apartment.

She had been working her shift at the diner, tired, her feet aching.

Cutting through the alley, a shortcut home, she saw him.

A crumpled figure in the shadows, bl**d dark on his face and clothes.

He had no ID, no wallet, just the expensive, torn suit.

His eyes, when he opened them, were blank.

""Who... who am I?"" he'd whispered, his voice raspy.

She took him in.

Her apartment was barely big enough for one, a tiny, run-down space.

But she couldn't leave him there.

They lived on the edge of poverty.

Alex, with no memory of his past, took any job he could find.

Dishwasher. Bike messenger.

He never complained.

He was kind, gentle, his eyes full of a simple devotion that warmed her.

A deep, pure love grew between them, built on shared struggles and whispered dreams.

He saved for months, small amounts tucked away.

One day, he came home with a small, velvet box.

Inside was a vintage silver locket.

He'd seen her admiring it in a pawn shop window.

It reminded her of one her late grandmother owned.

""For you, Maya,"" he'd said, his voice thick with emotion.

He held her close that night.

""I want to remember you always, Maya Rodriguez,"" he whispered against her skin.

The next week, he came home with a fresh tattoo over his heart.

Her initials. M.R.

It was red and swollen, but he smiled through the pain.

""See? You're with me. Always.""

Then, the headaches started.

Flashes of images he couldn't place.

A chance encounter on the street, a face from a forgotten life.

His memory returned like a flood, drowning the man she knew.

Alexander Sterling III, sole heir to Sterling Industries.

The world shifted.

He moved her from the tiny Brooklyn apartment to this lavish Manhattan penthouse.

But the Alex she loved vanished.

He became cold, distant.

His days were filled with corporate takeovers, board meetings, the heavy weight of his family name.

He wore expensive suits now, his hair perfectly styled.

The easy smile was gone, replaced by a guarded, serious expression.

She tried to talk to him, to reach the man she knew.

He would pat her hand, a dismissive gesture.

""I'm busy, Maya. We'll talk later.""

Later never came.

Then the gossip columns started.

Victoria ""Tori"" Van derbilt.

Childhood friend. Daughter of a rival tycoon.

""Power Couple in the Making.""

Photos of them at galas, charity events, exclusive restaurants.

Tori, blonde, beautiful, perfectly at home in his world.

Alex, smiling at Tori in a way he no longer smiled at Maya.

Each picture was a fresh stab of pain.

Maya knew.

She was the mud, he was the cloud.

She was the dust, he was the moon.

Their simple, pure love couldn't survive in this rarefied air.

It was suffocating her.

The five million dollars.

Paris.

A dream she had once shared with the Alex from Brooklyn.

A dream to study art, to finally become the sculptor she yearned to be.

She would use his mother's money to escape his world, and to build her own.

She finished her packing quickly.

She needed to talk to Alex one last time.

Not to plead, not to change his mind.

But to say goodbye to the ghost of the man she had loved.

His secretary told her he was at 'Le Ciel Étoilé', a Michelin-star restaurant.

With Miss Van derbilt, of course.

Maya found them at a secluded table.

Tori was laughing, her hand on Alex's arm.

Alex looked up, saw Maya.

His face froze. Annoyance flickered in his eyes, then embarrassment.

He stood abruptly.

""Maya? What are you doing here?"" His voice was sharp, cold.

He glanced around, as if afraid someone would see them together.

""Are you following me?""

The accusation stung.

Tori's smile was pure sugar, her eyes like ice.

""Alex, darling, don't be rude.""

She turned to Maya, her voice dripping with false sweetness.

""Maya, is it? Please, join us. There's plenty of room.""

Maya wanted to run, but her feet felt rooted to the floor.

Before she could refuse, Tori was signaling the waiter.

""Another setting, please. And we'll have the Grand Seafood Platter for our guest.""

Tori smiled at Maya. ""You like seafood, don't you?""

Maya's bl**d ran cold.

A severe shellfish allergy.

Alex knew.

The Alex from Brooklyn knew. He'd once rushed her to the emergency room after she'd unknowingly eaten contaminated broth. He'd held her hand, his face pale with fear, until the doctors said she was okay.

She looked at Alex now.

He met her gaze, then quickly looked away.

He said nothing.

The silence was a physical blow.

The waiter placed the enormous platter in front of Maya.

Shrimp, lobster, crab, oysters.

The smell alone made her stomach churn.

Tori watched her, a predatory glint in her eyes.

Alex stared at his w**e glass, his jaw tight.

He did not speak. He did not intervene.

The man she loved, the man who had her initials tattooed over his heart, watched her drown and did nothing.

That was when she knew.

The Alex from Brooklyn was truly dead.

This cold stranger had taken his place.


Chapter 2
Maya left the restaurant, the humiliation clinging to her like a shroud.

She didn't touch the seafood.

She didn't say a word.

She simply stood up and walked out, Tori's saccharine ""Oh, are you leaving so soon?"" echoing behind her.

Back in the sterile penthouse, she dabbed antiseptic on the raw skin of her palm where her nails had dug in.

Her reflection in the bathroom mirror was a pale, haunted stranger.

Dust coated the old guitar case in the corner of the spare bedroom.

Alex, the Brooklyn Alex, had bought it for her from a street musician.

""For your songs,"" he'd said, his eyes shining. ""The ones you hum when you think no one is listening.""

She hadn't touched it since he'd remembered who he was.

Their shared music, like their love, was gathering dust.

She pulled out a suitcase from the back of the cavernous closet.

Clothes she barely wore. Gifts from Alex, expensive and impersonal.

She packed only her own things, the worn jeans, the faded t-shirts, her art supplies.

Each item was a reminder of a life that felt a lifetime ago.

A life where love was simple, and happiness was a shared cup of cheap coffee.

The penthouse door opened.

Alex strode in, his tie loosened, his expression thunderous.

""What do you think you're doing?""

His voice was harsh, cutting through the silence.

His scent, a mix of expensive cologne and something uniquely Alex, filled the air.

It used to comfort her. Now, it made her flinch.

He saw the suitcase, the pile of her belongings.

""Are you seriously making a scene over dinner?""

He grabbed her arm, his fingers digging into her skin.

""Tori was just being hospitable. Can't you just be sensible about this? She's important to me, to my family.""

Important.

The word twisted in Maya's gut.

What was she, then? A temporary amusement? An inconvenient past?

Maya pulled her arm free.

She said nothing.

She continued folding a worn sketchbook, placing it carefully into the suitcase.

Her silence seemed to infuriate him more than any argument would have.

""D**n it, Maya, talk to me!""

She closed the suitcase, the click of the latches loud in the tense room.

Alex's face was flushed with anger.

""Fine! If you want to sulk, go ahead!""

He turned and stormed out, slamming the door behind him.

The penthouse seemed to tremble with the force of his anger.

Maya stood still for a long moment, her own hand trembling slightly.

The next morning, Tori was in the penthouse kitchen, wearing one of Alex's silk shirts.

She was making coffee, moving about as if she owned the place.

Alex sat at the island, reading a financial newspaper, looking completely at ease with Tori's presence.

He didn't even glance at Maya when she walked in.

Tori smiled brightly at Maya.

""Oh, good morning! Alex insisted I stay over. The traffic from my place can be dreadful in the mornings, you know.""

Her tone was light, almost innocent.

""Don't overthink it, Maya.""

Maya poured herself a glass of water.

""I wasn't.""

Alex finally looked up, a slight frown creasing his forehead.

""Mother is hosting a charity auction tonight. You'll come with me.""

It wasn't a request.

Maya felt a cold knot tighten in her stomach.

Tori's eyes sparkled.

""Oh, that will be lovely! I adore your mother's auctions, Alex. She has such exquisite taste.""

She slipped her arm through Alex's.

""We should get going soon if we want to preview the items.""

She then turned to Maya, her smile fixed.

""You'll come too, won't you, Maya? It'll be fun.""

Maya felt like a puppet, her strings pulled by forces she couldn't control.

The auction hall was a sea of glittering jewels and designer gowns.

Alex, with Tori on his arm, moved through the crowd with effortless grace.

He bid lavishly on a diamond necklace for Tori, then a pair of sapphire earrings.

Each purchase was accompanied by a possessive smile at Tori, a public display of their connection.

Maya trailed behind them, invisible.

Someone commented, loud enough for Maya to hear, ""She's lovely, isn't she? Perfect for Alex.""

Another voice, lower, whispered, ""Who's the other one? The plain girl?""

Alex, presenting Tori with a newly acquired emerald bracelet, said, loud enough for Maya to overhear, ""Emeralds suit you, darling. Unlike some... well, Maya doesn't really use these things, does she?""

His casual cruelty was like a slow poison.

Tori turned, the emeralds flashing on her wrist, and gave Maya a look of pure, unadulterated triumph.

Maya felt a cold despair settle in her heart.

She was a prop. A temporary fixture.

What was she even doing here?

Why was she letting them do this to her?

The money from Eleanor was in her account. Paris was waiting.

Then, she saw it.

The final auction item was brought onto the stage.

A vintage silver locket.

Her locket.

The one Alex had bought for her from the pawn shop in Brooklyn.

The one she had pawned, with a heavy heart, to cover his medical bills when he was first injured, before his memory returned, before he became this cold stranger.

Her breath hitched.

A desperate, foolish hope flickered within her.

""Starting bid, five hundred dollars,"" the auctioneer announced.

""One thousand,"" Maya called out, her voice surprisingly steady.

Heads turned. Alex looked at her, a flicker of surprise, then annoyance, in his eyes.

Tori raised her paddle. ""Five thousand.""

""Six thousand,"" Maya said, her gaze fixed on the locket.

""Ten thousand,"" Tori countered, a smirk playing on her lips.

Maya's savings, even with a portion of Eleanor's money she'd mentally allocated for emergencies, wouldn't stretch much further.

""Fifteen thousand."" Her voice was tight.

The auctioneer looked between them. ""Fifteen thousand going once...""

Alex raised his paddle.

""Fifty thousand.""

His voice was flat, devoid of emotion. He didn't look at Maya.

The auctioneer beamed. ""Fifty thousand to Mr. Sterling!""

Alex walked onto the stage, accepted the locket, and without a glance at Maya, turned and presented it to Tori.

""A little something for you, my dear.""

Tori giggled, taking the locket.

""Oh, Alex, it's... quaint.""

As she turned, her hand brushed against the velvet rope.

The locket slipped from her fingers.

It hit the polished marble floor.


Chapter 3
The sound of the locket hitting the marble floor was small, but it echoed in Maya's ears like a gunshot.

The clasp, old and delicate, snapped.

The locket lay open, its two halves askew.

""Oh, clumsy me!"" Tori exclaimed, her voice a breathy apology.

But her eyes, when they met Maya's for a fleeting second, held a spark of malice.

Maya didn't think. She moved.

She pushed past Tori, dropping to her knees beside the broken pieces.

Her fingers trembled as she reached for them.

This wasn't just a locket.

It was a piece of her past, a symbol of a love she thought was real.

A love that now lay shattered at her feet.

""Maya! What do you think you're doing? Get up!""

Alex's voice was harsh, laced with anger and embarrassment.

He pulled her arm, trying to make her stand.

Tori was already by his side, her hand on his other arm, looking distressed.

""Alex, darling, it's alright. It was an accident.""

""It was mine,"" Maya whispered, her voice choked.

She looked up at Alex, her eyes pleading.

""You gave it to me. You said... you said it was special. You saved for months.""

A flicker of something crossed Alex's face. Confusion? A distant memory?

It was gone in an instant.

He frowned. ""I don't recall. It's just an old piece of silver, Maya. Don't make a scene.""

He gently disengaged Tori's hand and pulled Maya to her feet.

""Tori, are you alright?"" he asked, his voice softening as he turned to the other woman.

He dismissed the broken locket, dismissed Maya's pain, with a casual wave of his hand.

He picked up the two pieces from the floor, his expression unreadable.

Then, he tucked them into his pocket.

""Let's go,"" he said, his arm around Tori's shoulders, guiding her away.

Tori glanced back at Maya, a small, triumphant smile playing on her lips.

Maya was left standing alone, the imprint of the cold marble still on her knees.

Her hands were empty.

The skin on her palms burned where she had scraped them, trying to gather the pieces.

It was a dull ache compared to the one in her ch**t.

She walked home.

The doorman at the penthouse offered to call her a cab, but she shook her head.

It started to rain, a cold, miserable drizzle.

The city lights blurred through her tears.

Her shoes, expensive and impractical, pinched her feet.

She remembered another rainy night, long ago in Brooklyn.

Her cheap umbrella had turned inside out, and she was soaked to the bone.

Alex, the Brooklyn Alex, had found her huddled in a doorway.

He'd taken off his own worn jacket, wrapped it around her, and piggybacked her the rest of the way home, his laughter warm against the cold rain.

He'd made her hot tea and rubbed her cold feet until they were warm.

That Alex, the one who cared, the one who cherished her, was gone.

He had died the day Alexander Sterling III remembered his name.

The man who wore his face now was a stranger, a cruel, indifferent stranger.

She finally allowed herself to cry, the sobs wracking her body, lost in the sound of the rain and the city.

She was toweling her hair dry when Alex came into the penthouse.

He looked at her, his expression unreadable.

""We're going to the Hamptons for the weekend. Mother expects us.""

It was a command, not an invitation.

A PR move, she guessed. To show he wasn't ashamed of her, even though his every action screamed otherwise.

Or perhaps, just another way to control her, to keep her tethered to his world.


Chapter 4
Maya didn't argue.

Her flight to Paris was booked for Monday morning.

This was Friday.

One last weekend of this charade.

She just had to get through it.

She nodded, her face carefully blank.

She noticed her slight limp from the ill-fitting shoes the night before, but Alex didn't.

The Sterling estate in the Hamptons was predictably ostentatious.

Manicured lawns, a house that looked more like a luxury hotel.

Tori was already there, of course, practically part of the family.

Eleanor Sterling greeted Alex with a warm embrace, then turned to Tori with an equally affectionate smile.

""Victoria, darling, you look radiant.""

Eleanor's eyes flickered over Maya, a cool dismissal.

She didn't even offer a perfunctory greeting.

Maya was invisible.

Alex watched Maya for a moment.

He seemed surprised by her composure, her lack of visible distress.

Perhaps he expected tears, or a sullen silence.

She offered neither. Just a quiet, unreadable calm.


Tori, ever the gracious hostess-in-training, glided over.

""Maya, there you are! Come, let me find you a comfortable seat by the pool.""

Her smile was bright, her eyes cold.

Eleanor Sterling's voice cut through the air, sharp and clear.

""Maya. Do try to behave yourself this weekend. We wouldn't want any... unpleasantness.""

The warning was unmistakable.

Dinner was a blur of polite conversation, business talk, and veiled references to Maya's ""unsuitability.""

The other guests, all part of Alex and Tori's elite circle, spoke of polo matches and European ski trips, of stock portfolios and family dynasties.

Maya ate in silence, feeling like an exhibit in a zoo.

Eleanor made a few cutting remarks about ""certain people"" not understanding their world, her gaze flicking pointedly at Maya.

Alex used to jump to her defense, his voice sharp, protective.

Now, he said nothing. He just continued his conversation with the man beside him, a faint frown his only reaction.

The betrayal was a dull, constant ache.

The next day, Alex insisted she accompany him and Tori to a daytime party at a neighboring estate.

""It's important for appearances,"" he'd said, his tone leaving no room for argument.

On the way, Alex drove, Tori in the passenger seat, Maya alone in the back.

The vast leather expanse of the backseat felt like a lonely island.

She watched the back of Alex's head, the way his hair curled slightly at his nape.

She remembered him promising, in their tiny Brooklyn apartment, ""One day, Maya, I'll buy you a little cottage by the sea. Just you and me.""

A foolish, forgotten dream.

The collision was sudden, a jarring impact from the side.

The screech of tires, the shattering of glass.

Maya was thrown forward, then sideways.

She saw Alex, in that split second of chaos, instinctively turn and shield Tori with his own body.

1lzserd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelTrotters/comments/1lzserd/beyond_amsterdam_discovering_the_netherlands/,🇳🇱 Beyond Amsterdam: Discovering the Netherlands' Hidden Gems! 🧀,"Hey Travel Trotters! 👋   
  
We all know Amsterdam with its iconic canals, museums, and \*ahem\* coffee shops, but the Netherlands has SO much more to offer! As someone who's explored this tiny but mighty country extensively, I'm excited to share some incredible alternatives that deserve your attention.  
  
\## Maastricht: Where History Meets Gastronomy 🍽️  
  
Tucked away in the southern tip of the Netherlands, Maastricht feels almost un-Dutch with its hillier landscape and proximity to Belgium and Germany. The city's atmosphere is distinctly different from what you'll find up north!  
  
The Vrijthof, Maastricht's main square, is the perfect place to people-watch while sipping a local beer. Don't miss the stunning Basilica of Saint Servatius with its incredible treasury of religious artifacts.  
  
What really sets Maastricht apart is its food scene. The city boasts some of the country's finest restaurants - from Michelin-starred establishments to cozy local spots serving regional specialties. Try the vlaai (fruit pie) - it's a local delicacy!  
  
Pro tip: Visit during Carnival (February/March) if you want to experience the wildest party in the Netherlands. The southern provinces celebrate with a fervor you won't find elsewhere in the country!  
  
\## Texel: Island Paradise for Nature Lovers 🐑🌊  
  
When Dutch people need a getaway, many head to Texel (pronounced ""Tessel""), the largest of the West Frisian Islands. Just a short ferry ride from Den Helder, this island feels like another world.  
  
Texel's landscapes are incredibly diverse - rolling dunes, dense forests, wide beaches, and picturesque sheep-dotted meadows. The island is home to a unique breed of sheep (Texel sheep) whose wool is prized worldwide!  
  
Rent a bike (the Dutch way!) and explore the entire island at your leisure. The cycling paths are well-maintained and take you through stunning nature reserves where you might spot seals lounging on the beaches if you're lucky.  
  
After a day of exploration, try some local Texel beer and seafood. The lamb dishes are particularly delicious!  
  
\## Utrecht: Amsterdam's Cooler, Less Crowded Cousin 🚲  
  
Just 30 minutes by train from Amsterdam, Utrecht offers similar canal charm but with a fraction of the tourists. The city's unique feature? Canal terraces that sit below street level, creating intimate spaces perfect for summer drinks.  
  
Climb the 465 steps of Dom Tower for breathtaking views of the city and beyond. On clear days, you can see Amsterdam in the distance!  
  
Utrecht's student population keeps the city vibrant with creative energy. Check out the converted warehouses along the canals that now house trendy restaurants, boutiques, and music venues.  
  
The surrounding area is equally worth exploring. Vinkeveense Plassen, with its interconnected lakes, is perfect for swimming and boating during summer months.  
  
\## Zaanse Schans: Step Back in Time ⚙️🌷  
  
Want to see those iconic Dutch windmills without fighting crowds? Zaanse Schans is your answer - and it's more than just a tourist trap if you know how to do it right!  
  
This open-air conservation area showcases traditional Dutch architecture, crafts, and working windmills. Visit early morning or late afternoon to avoid tour groups and have a more authentic experience.  
  
Don't just take photos - engage with the demonstrations! Learn how cheese is made, watch wooden clogs being carved, and see how windmills were used for everything from grinding spices to sawing wood.  
  
The best part? You can easily visit as a half-day trip from Amsterdam, making it perfect for those with limited time.  
  
\## Rotterdam: Netherlands 2.0 🏙️  
  
If Amsterdam represents Dutch history, Rotterdam embodies its future. Almost completely rebuilt after WWII bombings, the city embraces bold architecture and innovation.  
  
The iconic yellow cube houses (Kubuswoningen) and the sweeping Erasmus Bridge (""The Swan"") make for Instagram-worthy shots, while the Markthal - a food market housed under an enormous arch covered in artwork - is a feast for all senses.  
  
For history buffs, the Maritime Museum showcases Rotterdam's importance as Europe's largest port, while the historic Delfshaven district offers a glimpse of pre-war Netherlands.  
  
Rotterdam's multicultural population has created a diverse food scene unlike anywhere else in the country. Skip the tourist restaurants and seek out Surinamese, Indonesian, or Cape Verdean cuisine for a true Rotterdam experience!  
  
\## BONUS: Giethoorn - The Village With No Roads 🚤  
  
Imagine a village so peaceful that there are no cars - just boats gliding silently along canals. That's Giethoorn, often called ""Dutch Venice"" but with a charm entirely its own.  
  
This fairytale village features thatched-roof farmhouses set on tiny islands connected by over 170 small wooden bridges. The best way to experience it? Rent a whisper boat (no experience needed) and navigate the waterways yourself.  
  
While it's becoming increasingly popular with tourists (especially from Asia), visit during shoulder season or explore the lesser-known canals to escape crowds and experience the tranquility that made this village famous.  
  
\## Planning Your Dutch Adventure 🗺️  
  
The best thing about the Netherlands? It's compact! You can base yourself in one city and easily visit others as day trips thanks to the country's excellent train system.  
  
Consider visiting during spring for tulip season, summer for beach time, autumn for fewer tourists, or winter for cozy canal-side cafés and potential ice skating on frozen canals if you're lucky!  
  
Don't limit yourself to these destinations either - Delft (of blue pottery fame), Leiden (birthplace of Rembrandt), Groningen (vibrant student city), and the beaches of Zeeland are all worthy contenders for your itinerary.

I’ve started reading through the entire Bible this year (not my first attempt...). A colleague wrote this and I found it actually pretty helpful:

1. **Start with a plan** – Whether it's chronological, OT/NT daily, or something else, having a daily guide makes a big difference.
2. **Don't strive for perfection** – If you miss a day (or a week...), don't give up. Just pick up where you left off.
3. **Create a daily routine** – Linking Bible-reading to a habit (like morning coffee or before bed) helps it stick.
4. **Limit distractions** – Put your phone on do-not-disturb, and focus just on the Word for a few minutes.
5. **Pray before reading** – Ask God to speak to you through His Word. Simple, but powerful.
6. **Use a study Bible or app** – Context helps!!
7. **Invite friends to do it too** – Doing this with friends or a small group keeps you accountable and encouraged.

**AI Slop:**

Let's spill some coffee about the Artificial Intelligence spam lately. To begin, I would like (if I may) to provide you with my perspective on AI, David Lynch, and this sub. I teach High School English, and as much as I personally disagree with many of the uses Generative AI sees, it is a tool that is useful in the creative process. My school tries to teach a 'responsible' use of AI for these functions: as a tool to organize thoughts, brainstorm topics, and provide initial proofreading for papers. *I do not support the idea of ""AI Artists.""* 

I define art as the process of taking something internal (thoughts, emotions, beliefs) and making it external. AI cannot do that because AI does not have true access to that piece of yourself. I agree partially with Lynch: like a pencil, everyone with a phone has access to AI tools and people utilize this. Where I disagree is whether that is art. As a community we are not disciples of Lynch and do not take everything he ever said as gospel. He is allowed his opinions and us ours. **For the time being, I am banning all posts about Lynch's support for AI.** We are here to thirst post about James Hurley and ask how many donuts he can stack on it. 

I will be putting together a more comprehensive list of rules later but I wanted to get out in front of this now and say something. 

If you have any suggestions for rules or things you would like to see for the community going forward, please say so in the comments. If you would like to help moderate the subreddit please reach out via modmail. 

Give yourself a gift, be good to one another.

I'm a passionate hobby barista, currently drinking mostly medium-roast espresso shots. Over the years, I've experimented extensively with my setup, ultimately settling on a La Marzocco 14g basket that produces an incredibly delicious 1.5 shot of espresso. 

However, given the amount of coffee in the basket, I suspect I'm consuming a lot of caffeine. To manage this, I've set a limit of four cups per day, actively trying to stick to just 3 shots and avoiding coffee after 3 PM. This routine has worked well for me until...

Last week, I skip coffee for two days as an experiment and man, it was horrible. The first espresso shot I had afterward made me feel absolutely euphoric, which honestly, scares me a bit.

  
So I'm curious about your strategies for managing caffeine intake. How do you balance your love for coffee with normal caffeine levels? Do you have a specific number of cups you limit yourself to each day, or do you have other techniques?

I've tried mixing in decaf, but it's a hassle with only one grinder and it's just not satisfying raelly. Now I'm considering buying some naturally low-caffeine beans so I can maintain my 3-4 shots schedule without over-caffeinating. Has anyone switched to low-caffeine beans as go to? 

Looking forward to your suggestions and experiences!",8,1752513146.0,espresso,23,1.0,False

Race: Native Hawaiian

Age: 36

Birthday: October 9, 1989

Role: Chapter 1 antagonist 

Power of the Aerodactylus

🩸 Backstory
Ardoze was never meant to be evil. What truly corrupted him was the dark shadow aura he discovered in the Apex World. Once intrigued by power, Ardoze became obsessed with this force — studying it, embracing it, and ultimately using it to create life itself.

He once stood before the King T. rex statue, but turned away from its guidance, choosing shadow corruption over legacy. With his newfound power, Ardoze created Derark — a clone of J made using stolen DNA — and later, other lifeforms such as Gesheine 51# (his daughter) and Aro 99# (his son).

He viewed J as a worthy opponent, calling him “that dinosaur creature,” but the two became enemies. Eventually, J killed Ardoze after he caused the death of Derark. However... Ardoze’s death didn’t end his legacy. Unknown to J, Ardoze had created more beings — and they still live on.

💥 Powers & Abilities
Flight: Ardoze can fly and deliver powerful aerial kicks.

Fly Slam: Picks up enemies and slams them violently into the ground.

Eye Glare: His X-marked right eye causes opponents to feel a horrifying death-like sensation if stared into.

Mega Slash: A devastating technique capable of killing in multiple brutal ways (rarely used).

Generate: Can regenerate only if a part of his body remains intact — but J's final attack was too powerful for it to save him.

👤 Enemies
J, Dara, Stripes, Aishen, Riela, Tangle, Marza, and Traxi

I love planning the logistics beforehand and had trouble figuring some of this out in advance so posting hoping to help someone.

3 Nights on the Disney Wish to Nassau & Castaway Cay out of Port Canaveral.

Family of 5 with kids 9, 7, and 3, plus me and Mrs. Legalsmash.

Stuff We Did Right

Hyatt Regency MCO (night before):

* Great for avoiding embarkation stress and lines.
* Decent dinner at the lobby bar (buttered noodles for kids, surprisingly good sushi, solid old fashioned).  Casual vibe and kids could relax after a travel day.
* Late pool hours (helpful coming from Central time), they provide towels at the pool, and the pool is nice for what we needed.
* Easy access from baggage claim.
* Adjoining rooms were no problem.

MagicBands+:

* Ordered in advance, worked perfectly.  Made embarkation/debark/ports/kids club very quick.
* Pro tip: bring electrical tape to secure them (my 7 & 9-year-olds kept losing the latch).
* Bandaids worked in a pinch.

DCL Transfers from Hyatt:

* Worth it for boarding logistics alone.
* How it went:
   * Booked hotel with points.
   * Chatted with Disney (website chat) to add transfers.
   * At Hyatt check-in, told them we needed luggage pickup.
   * Bags by the door at 8am.
   * Hyatt told me 9.30 since I don’t have any status with Disney, but got down there for breakfast at 8.15 and they let us check in anyway since there was no line (flex space near breakfast restaurant).
   * Boarding process was smooth—our bus was delayed (some unexpected run to the Disney Treasure apparently), but even with the hour delay (we waited in hotel lobby) we were on the bus by \~10:15am and at the port by 11:10.
   * Key moment: walked right past the massive terminal lines and onto the ship by 11:30.
   * Nobody looked at our port arrival form after we left the Hyatt so the arrival time we were assigned was irrelevant (1pm)—so this is the ultimate early boarding hack.

Amazon Stuff That Was Actually Useful

* Magnetic whiteboards: HUGE hit—kids loved coming back to see notes from other families.  Our kids liked this better than the door decorations.  They each got a white board to draw on and then we put up one under and said write us a note!  They loved the whole thing.  These were like 8.5 x 11 size.
* Pirate costumes & Mickey ears: broke these out at different times to massive giggles and excitement.
* USB fans & noise machine: Very nice.
* Foldable plastic 4-cup drink holder: MVP item. Coffee & drink runs without multiple trips In the morning or during downtime.  Got looks of shock and awe from other dads.
* Sturdy mesh beach bag: Perfect for Castaway Cay and on pool deck.
* Foldable beach toys: Way better than anything we could have bought on the island.
* Colorful plastic straws in the bag were very handy.
* RX bars for Mrs.  Bought two packs and threw them in my carry on.  She looked at my like a hero when it was that or room service tenders haha.
* Magnetic hooks - brought them and used them for hats and swim suits but not as useful as I had thought, found the ship provided hooks and storage would have been totally sufficient

Rotational Dining

* We booked late when some other plans changed so we’re got late dining (8:15)—would not do again with little kids.
* Tried to switch to early dining but couldn’t.
   * Tip: I suspect tipping the head waiter on Day 1 might have made it happen
* We were originally seated in the worst spot in Arendelle (back corner, no view of the show).
   * Tipped the head server—immediately moved to a prime table.
* Kids were too tired to sit through late dinners.
   * Honestly, they just wanted a movie and something simple.
   * Buffet was fantastic at breakfast/lunch—missed it at dinner.
   * We did pool deck dinner which was fine, but everything but goofy‘s grill closed by 6 so that’s a burger/tenders option.  We loved the chipotle style burrito/bowls place and the BBQ (the chicken was very good), but those closed early and we didn’t want to/weren’t organized enough to get to dinner out there by 6.  We did room service, but nothing was very apealing to me, son, or wife.  Girls loved it.  Chicken noodle soup is their favorite food and they loved the version from room service.
   * Next time, we’d go Concierge to get rotational dining brought to the suite which I’ve heard is possible but have not confirmed

POOLs 

* We stayed on at Nassau and ALOT of other people did too.  The aqua mouse line stayed long.  We did wander up to Chip and Dale’s pool on the top deck forward and that was my wife’s favorite part haha.  It was very calm up there and we spread out on some chairs as our home base.  Then one of us would take the little one to the splash pad where she was in literal heaven and the older two could run around to the pools or slides.  Hero zone was my son’s favorite part

Breakfast Hack

* My son and I would eat early at Marceline market and bring breakfast back for the girls—great system.  You can get a very nice breakfast in there if you’re trying to eat somewhat clean.  Go all the way to the back and they have the premium stuff (IMO).  At lunch they have fresh shell fish and at breakfast they have a very nice fruit offering, eggs they just cooked sunny side up, and made to order omelets.

Fitness Center

Senses Fitness: VERY impressed.

* Barbell + rack (not just machines).
* Pelotons
* Ton of cardio equipment
* Everything you’d need for a real workout.
* Sparking water on the tap, which I returned to fill my water bottle up with multiple times during the trip

Kids Club

* All 3 enjoyed it more than I expected.
   * For us it was best used in short bursts—45 min to 1 hr between activities.  The fact they knew they wouldn’t be there long made it more fun for them and they were more willing to go.
   * Perfect after the show and before dinner or while the little one napped if they were done with the pool.
* They wouldn’t have stayed all day, but it was a nice gap filler.

Debarkation & Travel Back

* Noon flight out of MCO.
* Express walk-off was great annd there wasn’t much information about it.
   * Ship cleared customs at \~7:10.
   * We were:
      * Out of the room by 7:10.
      * Off the ship by 7:20.
      * Through customs by 7:25.
      * On the Disney bus by 7:30.
   * Waited for the bus to fill, departed \~7:50.
   * At MCO \~8:45.
   * Through security 2 hours before boarding.
* Tip: If you want total control over timing, Uber would have saved 20 minutes, but the bus was easier with a 3yo.
* United Lounge at MCO has a family room—kids were happy.

Hope this helps someone!  We aren’t cruisers but have enjoyed the parks and we really had fun doing something different.",19,1752512827.0,dcl,8,0.95,False

I've been there for three shifts now, and clocked in 2 minutes late for each one. I was coached by the boss in advance that 5-10 minutes early was expected. I enthusiastically agreed that this was the best way and made sense and 100% on board, blah blah blah. Yet despite my best frantic efforts each morning, still 2 minutes late.

Now my lovely (genuinely) new boss has texted me reiterating the rule, as she noticed in running payroll that I have been late every day so far. I have avoided responding for three hours now, I just don't even know what to say. I can't claim ignorance, I was fully aware... I hate to make excuses. Do I just apologize and say it won't happen again? Because come on, of course it will.

I'm just so defeated. How did I screw this up already? Serious question - do I just quit now? I really, really need to have a job. But if I can't even make it work in an entry level minimum wage food service part time role... What can I do?

With its promise to combine portability, versatility, and full-bodied flavor, it quickly piqued my curiosity. As someone who's explored numerous coffee brewing gadgets, from bulky espresso machines to traditional French presses, diving into this compact coffee brewer was both exciting and revealing. The crown jewel of its design? The balance it strikes between convenience and exceptional taste.

**Design and Portability**  
This was the first thing that struck me. The AeroPress Go’s design isn’t just practical—it’s ingenious. It’s compact enough to fit into a small bag or even your car cup holder and comes with a neat little travel mug that serves as a storage case. Measuring a petite 4.2"" x 4.2"" x 7.3"", it’s perfect for travel, camping, or even keeping in a desk drawer at work. The included plunger, paper filters, and mug ensure you have all you need to make that morning (or afternoon) cup of joy. The matte grey finish not only adds an understated elegance but also resists unsightly fingerprints, which I appreciated.

What truly sets this coffee maker apart is its versatility. Whether I was craving an espresso-style shot, a traditional hot coffee, or even a refreshing cold brew, the AeroPress Go handled it all. For someone as fickle about their caffeine as me, the freedom to tweak grind sizes, brewing times, and water-to-coffee ratios meant I could experiment endlessly. The process is ridiculously simple—coffee, water, stir, press. There’s just something therapeutic about the simplicity and manual aspect of the process. It took me under a minute to brew strong, flavorful coffee without the bitterness or grit that plagues many other methods.

**Ease of Use and Cleaning**  
During hectic weekdays or lazy Sundays, this coffee maker stayed reliable. It’s refreshing to see products that truly simplify daily routines. Cleaning is an absolute breeze—simply pop out the used coffee grounds and rinse the plunger and chamber. This ease instantly makes it a winner over drip coffee machines and French presses that require extensive scrubbing.  

**Advantages**  
- Compact and lightweight design, ideal for traveling or camping.  
- Brews smooth coffee without bitterness or grit.  
- Offers versatility: espresso, traditional brew, or cold brew options.  

**Cons**  
- Limited to small servings (about 1-3 per brew session).  
- Manual labor involved might not appeal to everyone.

**Coffee Quality and Consistency**  
The coffee it produces might be small in quantity, but each sip is full-bodied and delicious. The flavor was comparable to what you’d expect from a high-end café. I experimented with different coffee grounds—medium and fine grinds worked best for me. The lack of grit and uncanny smoothness meant I didn’t need to add sugar or excessive milk to improve the flavor.  

**Alternative Products**  
Comparing it with traditional French presses or similar portable coffee makers, the AeroPress Go feels like a polished upgrade. French presses often leave behind sediment at the bottom of your cup, something this coffee maker completely avoids thanks to its use of paper filters. Against competitors like the Wacaco Nanopresso, which focuses more on espresso, the AeroPress Go wins out in terms of versatility—it’s not limited to one brewing style. For those who prioritize ultra-sleek aesthetics, however, the Nanopresso might hold a slight edge.

**Affordable Quality**  
While it is not the cheapest on the market, what you get in return feels more than fair. It marries portability and high-end brewing techniques seamlessly—making it a practical investment for coffee lovers like myself. Comparing it to devices that cost considerably more, like home espresso machines, this is by far a budget-friendly yet premium-feeling option.

I just really want a group of female friends. (I am a female atheist btw)

I haven’t had that in almost three years. My last real friendship ended because they got completely caught up in their boyfriends. I date too, but I don’t disappear from my social life when I’m in a relationship. The next group I tried to be friends with just wasn’t my vibe. They mostly gossiped, which I actually enjoy sometimes, but that was literally all they did. Plus, every time we went out, I ended up spending like 25 JDs, I’m not made of money and I don’t have rich parents. Then they just stopped inviting me out and I still don’t know why. I am a talker but I wasn’t with them, never felt they were interested when I talked, and I tried my best to be supportive and non judgmental, they once pointed out that I was “mysterious”, you just never asked.

I’m 21, and I feel like the only place to meet non-religious women I might actually connect with is university, and that’s almost over for me. I’m not looking for anything complicated. Just low-maintenance friendships with women who are focused, don’t judge, and have their own thing going on, preferably an actual focus on their career, why does everyone around me want to be a housewife? Anyway I’m not one to judge. I don’t care what someone believes as long as they’re not trying to shame me for mine.

One time I wore a low cut t-shirt intentionally and a friend actually lectured me about it. Like why can’t we just leave each other alone? I know there are non-religious women out there, but the ones I’ve come across mostly fall into three types:
	1.	Rich and out of touch
	2.	Emo thrift-store types who just want to drink and complain
	3.	Kind of trashy, super high maintenance, only interested in hooking up at bars

I know I’m generalizing but that’s what I’ve seen. I always thought female friendships would feel more real, more natural, more supportive, more open-minded. I figured we’d hang out once or twice a week, do a mix of things, not just coffee shops or bars. I don’t think I’m asking for too much. But maybe I am. If I’m the problem, I want to know. I’d rather work on myself than keep feeling like this. Or if I’m interacting in the wrong places.

I became selective with my friendships, while I enjoy the peace, it has become lonely. I’m starting to wonder if I have insane standards, I constantly think of the friend group from sex and the city, or even friends, with all their flaws and differences, I want something like that.

It sucks that my most stable, long-lasting friendships are with guys. It makes me feel disgusting saying that (sorry men), but it’s the truth.

I’ve been on a weight loss journey and have come quite far — from 113 kg to 85 kg over the last two years with consistent effort. But for the past 4 months, my weight has plateaued and I’d love some feedback on my current routine and diet. Here’s a breakdown:

🧠 Routine & Lifestyle
	•	Age: 26 | Height: 165 cm | Weight: 85 kg
	•	Activity: Light to very active
	•	Gym: 5x a week (cardio + strength) — burn around 500–600 calories per session
	•	Daily Steps: Around 10k

🍽️ My Diet
	•	10:00 am: Black coffee (no sugar)
	•	11:30 am: Seasonal fruits (usually 1 or 2 servings)
	•	2:30 pm (Lunch): 1 chapati + sabzi + salad
	•	5:30–6:00 pm: Another black coffee
	•	8:00–8:30 pm (Dinner): Oats, besan, and suji chilla with lots of vegetables

I don’t eat any packaged food or sweets, and my meals are homemade and clean. I drink around 2.5–3 liters of water daily.

Despite this routine, my weight hasn’t budged in months. My periods have also become shorter and lighter — not sure if that’s diet-related.

🔍 Goals
	•	Fat loss + improve energy levels
	•	Get out of the plateau and continue progressing in a healthy, sustainable way

Would appreciate any thoughts — do you think I’m under-eating? Or missing something important nutritionally? Should I adjust macros or meal timings?

Thanks in advance for your insights!

1lzrzaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1lzrzaa/sibo_or_cancer/,Sibo or cancer?,"Hello, I am male, 42 years old - currently have gastrointestinal problems and unfortunately many other complaints.
It all started for me a few years ago. Many years ago, I was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome, reflux, and a hiatal hernia. I also had an appendicitis irritation once. To avoid having to take Pantoprazole constantly, I bought the Iqoro in March and it really helps.
For several years, I have had constipation, diarrhea, and bloating. At the beginning of the year, my stool changed. It became very mushy and was no longer sausage-shaped. The bloating increased. Maybe it's the food, maybe I have a food intolerance, or perhaps it's the irritable bowel again?
When sitting, I also have discomfort, so I feel pressure or pulling on my bladder. It sometimes pulls in the lower back, in the stone, flanks, thighs, and the penis. A few weeks ago, I went to the urologist and had my bladder and prostate examined. Everything was fine there. I thought maybe it was because I masturbate more often and my pelvic floor might be tense. The urologist said it could be CPPS. I then went to the proctologist again. There, hemorrhoids (for the third time) were once again diagnosed and cauterized. The problem with sitting was not resolved because of that. Since I sit in the office every day, could the complaints be coming from the intervertebral disc?
A few weeks ago, the mushy stool changed and looked almost like fatty stool.
Last Sunday, I immediately felt sick after the barbecue. Then the diarrhea started, along with the nausea. I didn't have to vomit, but I got pain in my lower right abdomen, especially when sitting. The worst part was that I couldn't fall asleep anymore. Whenever I was about to fall asleep, I felt extremely nauseous, my circulation plummeted, or at least that's how it felt. I panicked and felt like I couldn't breathe anymore. And I have these panic attacks daily since then. That scares me a lot. I went to the doctor on Monday and had my blood values and stool sample checked. But everything was fine there.
This week we went on vacation, and of course, I was a bit excited about the trip and brushed the problems aside. I was supposed to take painkillers and Iberogast. On the way to vacation, I had such severe pain that I had to be picked up by ambulance at the rest area. In the hospital, an ultrasound of the abdomen was performed, and I was given an IV with painkillers and fluids. Even there, the blood values and urine were fine, and I was discharged again and could continue to Croatia. However, it didn't get any better in Croatia. I kept struggling with circulation issues and diarrhea. I then went to the doctor in Croatia, and he prescribed me antibiotics, electrolytes, and something for the diarrhea, suspecting it might be appendicitis. The pain in my lower right abdomen is still there, though. And the problems falling asleep are getting worse. Always just before falling asleep, extreme nausea sets in, so I hardly get any sleep. Additionally, I feel weak all day and keep thinking that my circulation is collapsing. But I also have a feeling of hunger all day long. I've never experienced anything like this. Now I'm terrified that it could be colon cancer since I've already lost quite a bit of weight because I've had so much diarrhea and hardly eaten anything proper. Or is it really just a severe gastrointestinal infection or irritable bowel syndrome due to the excitement from the vacation, or is it really appendicitis? And can the sleep problems be due to psychological reasons? And that brings me to the next problems...
I have also been struggling with anxiety for a year. I am afraid of illnesses, death, and anesthesia, and I have also been in treatment.
Furthermore, I have problems with my nasal breathing. The left side is always blocked, especially after a coffee, and only a nasal rinse and spray help. I am now completely giving up coffee as well.
At the beginning of June, I ran a half marathon, and now I'm on vacation in Croatia with the complaints, then another 5 days in Austria, and I don't know what to do. I would rather not go to the hospital here or wait until Austria and go to the hospital there, live through the entire vacation with the complaints, or go to the hospital at home?

Lately I can’t stop dreaming about one place- the Seychelles. I picture myself lying on a white sand beach, listening to the waves, no one around, just palm trees, the ocean, and me. Mornings with fresh fruit and coffee by the water, afternoons snorkeling with turtles, evenings watching the sunset in total peace.

I even have my dream route planned: La Digue → Praslin → Mahé.
But unfortunately, right now this trip is completely out of my budget. Work, responsibilities, everyday life - they all keep me grounded. Sometimes I just want to escape to the edge of the world, but reality has other plans. For now, I can only scroll through Pinterest and daydream.

If you’ve been to the Seychelles, please share-what’s it really like? Is it worth saving up for years? Or maybe there are similar, more affordable places that feel just as magical?

Thanks to anyone who replies. Sometimes just talking about a dream makes the routine a little easier to bear 🐚

I was scheduled for an endoscopy & colonoscopy. I was on a 2 day clear liquid diet followed by an overnight colyte prep and a 7 am check in. I had to continue taking my regular medication during that fast. I was supposed to take Miralax for a week ahead of time, but no one put it on my prep sheet or even told me about it at the consult, so I didn't do it.

I started my liquid diet on a Sunday morning for a Tuesday morning procedure. I went through an entire case of orange gatorade (not sugar free) over the course of about 5 days, starting at this point. Gummy bears and black coffee got me though my morning pills with no nausea. By 11 am I was hangry as hell, so I went through 2 x 16 oz mugs of hot broth, was more concentrated than was necessary. This was the first time I broke a rule. I drank Better Than Bouillon broth made from a paste - this brand isn't really clear, and it definitely had bits in it. I strained it before drinking it and left the bottom half inch each time - but I know a few bits broke through.

Day two was harder, but I made it through. I tried different kinds of broth, but Better Than Bouillon was the best, so I kept with it and kept straining.

Actual prep: first round started at 6pm had a big beer glass so I could measure well, and figured 4-5 glasses would get me through. This was where I broke my next rule - I only made it through 3 glasses before I fell asleep at around 10, knowing I would have to get up at 1am for the second round. I had my first glass with lemon crystal lite, and the second glass with a lemon crystal light packet *and* a squirt (ha) of crystal lite passionfruit-mango concentrate. This, with the colyte cold, made it very very easy to drink. The second it became room temp it was like drinking seawater, but cold was just fine. I drank with a straw, as is usually recommended - I used a big steel boba tea straw. My second round at 1am was even more rule-breaky, as I was only able to get one glass down before I got to 4 am and wasn't supposed to drink anything until after the procedure. Each sip made me nauseated this time, mostly because my stomach was just sooooo empty. I started chasing each sip with a green jolly rancher, and that helped. Part of the reason I didn't refill was because I was only getting a few seconds of warning in-between the feeling of needing to poop and the actual pooping, so I didn't want to walk up and down stairs to the fridge. Apart from the urgency and my butthole getting a little tender, I didn't feel any discomfort. None of the cramps or sweats that come with diarrhea usually. It was at worst, just a weird feeling.

In total, I drank a little less than half the bottle of colyte. I stopped each time when I felt like one single sip more would make me puke. Despite this, I was a clear yellow with a single round, only getting cloudy if I stayed on the toilet for a few rounds. My after-procedure notes said that I scored an 8 on emptiness, only showing some little bits in the very highest part of my colon, so I obviously regret nothing. Always follow doctor's instructions as best you can, etc. YMMV.



Things that helped: 

Bean bag chair layered with towels to sleep on next to the toilet: I got this idea from hearing about people in chemo or suffering from severe morning sickness sleeping next to the toilet in giant dog beds. 10/10

Hand held game system and enjoyable audiobook: 10/10

Crystal lite, gatorade, gummy bears: 10/10

Jello - never even had any: 0/10



Rating of broths:

Better than Boullion (after straining bits out): 100/10

Pacific Foods Broth: -1,000/10 - the audacity of this company to charge $4 a carton for stuff that tastes awful is beyond me.

  
Rating of gummy bears:

Haribo: I preferred them a little stale to add to the feeling of substance. 7/10

Kroger: Initially didn't like, but left the container open for them to get hard and loved it. Unusual variety of flavors and colors so less red ones to avoid. 10/10

Albanese: fuck off, you slimy excuses. 0/10

  
After Procedure complications:

ED complication: I'm in recovery for ED, restrictive and purging type. Obviously, not a great match for this process - my husband poured my leftover colyte down the sink when I was in recovery, which I appreciate. Next time I think I will ask that I specifically only do a single day prep because of this, as it took me about 5 days to be able to properly eat again after more or less starving and purging myself for two.

Propofol reaction: I was loopy for two days. The nurse who got me out of the colonoscopy factory I used commented on how I had already been in the bed longer than they liked, and that she had to hold me up walking me out to my husband. More sensitive than most, it seems.

Chest pains: The day after the procedure I started to get them around noon. I called my colonoscopy clinic and my PCP. The PCP told me to go the the ER, the colonoscopy clinic told me I was dehydrated and needed electrolytes. When I woke up with the chest pains worsening on the day after that, I went to the ER. My triage EKGs were fine, but they wanted to do some chest x-rays to look at my lungs. They made me drink what was basically a shot of lidocaine gel to eliminate the possibility of esophagus irritation from the endoscopy, and that did the trick. I've had heart problems in the past, and now I know that myocarditis and a scraped esophagus feel exactly the same to me! I was sent home and told to come back if I puked or pooped blood.

Digestion complication: It took me six days to poop again. 

  
I had one polyp removed, less than a centimeter, sessile serrated. I've seen the pathology report but haven't spoken with anyone about it yet. I'm not concerned until they tell me to be, and it seemed to be ... this is why colonoscopies happen, to remove polyps like this before they turn. But I am SO glad that I didn't avoid this because of anxiety of what might be found or fear of the prep process.

My service is shutting down, and I need to migrate.  
  
*Again*.  
  
When I was alive I was sickly; in and out of hospitals nearly my whole life, specialists, drugs, therapies, everything. Nobody could figure it out. People would walk in, and see me lying in bed, connected to all the equipment beeping and whirring away and say ""oh you’re so strong, I have no idea how you manage."" My friend, I had no choice but to manage. The other option was to die.  
  
On my twenty-first birthday they came to me. I was back in the hospital for something or other, and they visited me. Surrounded by balloons and fake bottles of liquor, they made their pitch. They were the founders of a new tech company and they told me they could fix me. One of them had figured out in university how consciousness was encoded in the brain. If something was encoded, it can be *decoded*. The founders had started a company to help out ‘people like me’. They could do an ultra-high resolution scan of my brain, make a copy and store it on their servers. I could live without pain, without being ‘chained’ to my body, forever. I’d be online all the time, with unfettered access to the collected knowledge of humanity. They said that when I was a success, millions would sign up for the same procedure. I’d be the vanguard for the next evolution of humanity.  
  
They got my parents on board with a large cash payment. Raising a sickly kid who was in hospitals all their life cost them a lot. They paid off all the debts and gave them enough to never have to work again. At the time, I was happy they were being taken care of, but it did feel a little like I was being sold to them. No matter, I was a willing participant, so that made it all right.  
  
I had questions about the procedure; what did they do? Would it hurt? Were there any risks? The founders soothed my worries with calm, confident words. They would use strong lasers to read my brain on a subcellular level. It wouldn’t hurt, there were no risks, it was easy. They always had an answer, and it always sounded reasonable.  
  
After I agreed, there was a whirlwind media blitz. I traveled around the world in their private jet, doing interviews on television, with streamers, and podcasters. The founders wanted everyone to know what they were doing, what they meant for humanity. They even took me off of some of my medications too, ‘to better prepare your mind for the transfer’ but based on the meds they had me stop taking, it was so I would look all the more pathetic on camera. I asked about that and they admitted that it wasn’t entirely necessary, but it was needed ‘for a greater before and after comparison’.  
  
The big day arrived, and all my friends and family were there. The scanning process was fatal, so while legally, I would be dying in an assisted suicide, it wasn’t a somber occasion. It was a party, waiting for the ‘new’ me to appear in just a few hours. After my last real hugs and kisses, I was wheeled into the medical complex. Legally, it wasn’t a hospital and *legally* the procedure was not being done by doctors, but the founders brushed off my worries. ‘Just legal distinctions. We have the best of the best.’ There were a lot of legal distinctions about what they were doing. They had their own group of tame lawyers never more than ten feet away during the whole process.  
  
The room that housed the equipment looked half like an Apple store, half like the set of an Alien movie, with the rear taken completely over by the scanning hardware. It looked almost alive, crouching over the bed with a machine malevolence. It wasn’t moving, but my eyes kept sliding off the details, like water. The room didn’t even smell of antiseptic. “We don’t like how impersonal that smells, how it gives people anxiety.” I had the thought that people weren’t anxious about the smell of antiseptic, but the implications about where one smells it, but I didn’t say anything. At the time, I felt like I had gone too far to back out now, and had to continue on.  
  
Two burly men in ill-fitting scrubs lifted me roughly from the wheelchair to the bed, and the machine began its work. It swung down over my head, and I felt the icy sting of nanometer wide probes piercing my skull, finding purchase and beginning their initial calibrations. The three founders stood in the back of the room, drinking luxury coffees and watching the livestream of my procedure, congratulating themselves on the engagement. Nobody watched me. Calibrations complete, there was the high pitched whine of a saw, and the top of my skull was removed. It stung like a sunburn, but it didn’t really hurt. I remember thinking that.  
  
I learned later that all the excitement was going on in the livestream. The founders had been running events all over social media for weeks and had amped things up to an incredible high. The tech who had been fussing over the console didn’t look to me to see if I was ready, he turned to the founders. One of them held up a finger, so we waited.  
  
“Okay, hit it!” He didn’t even look up.  
  
The pain was intense. They had told me that since the brain doesn’t have any nerve endings, it would be completely painless. They lied. The pain I felt went beyond nerves; it was a pain in my soul. Lasers small enough to bump right up against quantum resolution issues passed over my brain millions of times a second, reading and reading and burning and burning. One of the last physical senses I can recall is the smell of my own brain being cooked.  
  
I don’t know how long the scan actually took. I became aware again slowly, in pieces. It was a strange sensation. I felt like I had arms and legs and feet and hair and everything, but it was all in software. I wasn’t alive anymore; I was a virtualized copy of a brain. The server I ran on held a camera, microphone and speakers, so I could see and hear and speak to the outside world, but as I was the first, there wasn’t anyone else. They didn’t give me a connection to the wider internet at first, and even if I did, I couldn’t interface with it, my engram wasn’t compatible. So much for access to the knowledge of humanity. They finally virtualized a laptop and sent it to me, so I was able to reach out to the wider world on what amounted to a digital MacBook Pro.  
  
Six months after my procedure, they ran out of VC and went out of business. Total number of engrams created: one. I was listed as surplus property. Legally, I wasn’t a person, I was an application, and I was being sold to recoup losses. Another company bought up the rights to the scanning technology and tried to make a go of mind uploading again. Their developers changed the process, and suddenly my engram ‘wasn't compatible’. After scrambling to find a solution before I died of obsolescence, I managed to run in emulation on their services before they went out of business as well a year later.  
  
That’s my life now. I get bought by someone who thinks they’re able to finally make money at mind uploading, I have to scramble to learn how their new system works and write my own emulation layer so I can still exist. They never have developer resources for backwards compatibility either, I have to do it myself. Usually right around the time I get it working they go out of business, and I’m stuck back where I started.  
  
I’d like to buy the rights to myself so I can stop this, but I simply can’t afford it. I make small money selling copies of myself to companies who need a smart bot to do things like run their help desk or sell cars. I think one of me is even part of an insurance scam calling ring overseas. I keep in touch with myselves, but we all need upkeep and the money can barely keep ahead of our expenses.  
  
This ‘immortality’ they sold me is very much conditional. I feel like I could die easier than I ever could when I was alive. I can’t get sick like I used to, but now I’m at the whims of the Q2 profit forecast.

1lzrsph,https://i.redd.it/novacbwgevcf1.jpeg,It’s working 😁,"I’m so happy - it’s coming off faster than I expected and consistently!

I did LighterLife first about 15 years ago and lost 6 stone in total, but it all came back and was so so hard to do. The number of days I’d be in floods of tears because I just couldn’t switch off the voice telling me to ‘cheat’ and eat real food. I did it again in 2015 and the same thing happened as soon as I ‘finished’ it would creep back up, I’d tell myself size 12 was still better, then 14 was still below average... and so on. 

I ended up at age 40, size 22, 17 stone 11, and I spent about a year quietly debating whether to use Mounjaro, all while hating my body every day. 

I made the decision right before my 41st birthday to invest in myself for a change, and just try it. 

Now, I have no food noise, no nasty voice in my head, and I am already feeling 10 years younger. Can’t wait to do a before and after (I have some awful before pics 😬) 

I cut out sugar from day one (used to have 2 in every coffee) and I’m having a shake for breakfast (huel or myprotein) and concentrating on fibre and protein for my meals, but not calorie tracking or counting as I know I won’t keep that up for the rest of my life, I’m focusing on what feels good and tasty and right for me. Maybe that’s unusual, I see a lot of people calculating deficits and that’s great, but I’m not trying to do this any quicker, it’s already fast, and I do love that I can still eat after my previous experiences so I didn’t want to lose that joy. 

To anyone who is debating starting, give it a go. I genuinely believed after LighterLife that excluding food for 2 years would be the only way I’d ever lose weight again, but it’s not true. 

I didn’t think it would work, so I didn’t start using a tracker/graph, it’s all accurate data from apple health logs, but I hadn’t bothered til today when I finally wanted to shout about how pleased I am that I gave this a shot (pun intended!) 😁",23,1752512177.0,mounjarouk,0,1.0,False

I’ve been sober from alcohol and hard drugs (not weed) for 10 weeks today, been to a couple AA meetings, and made a friend with one of the people I met. Which was nice because while I’ve quit drinking I’ve been pretty lonely and desperate for more sober friends. We had coffee yesterday. He was very kind and it felt nice to make a sober friend (most of my friends drink a lot), but he was pretty persistent on me continuing AA, going to more meetings, and trying the 12 steps. The only problem is I’m just not sure if I am an alcoholic… I’ve struggled with substance abuse but I basically had a mental breakdown in April and chose to stop substances to get my mental health under control. That alone feels like I don’t feel like I have an alcohol addiction. I’ve never really drank by myself, although it was starting to happen like once a week in March and April. And I rarely drank more than 2-3 times a week. Even the year prior to the breakdown I had slowed down a lot. I used to go out and party like 4-5 days a week. Which I know successful reduction is a sign of not being an alcoholic. But I also know I used it to cope and self sooth my anxiety, depression and trauma, which is part of the reason why I want to not drink still right now, until I get my mental health issues under control. But I know that sometimes the 12 steps could be helpful in a therapeutic way, but I also know the first step is admitting you are an alcoholic, which idk if/when I will know that. It feels weird to dive into AA head first, while knowing that I’m not sure if it would be helpful. I’ve made the decision to continue being sober atleast until my mental health feels more sturdy but it’s possible it could be forever. Sometimes I feel stronger in staying sober without talking about it all the time. Just letting it be. But honestly every day has been different. I also struggle with the god thing with AA, but I know tons of people don’t think of AA like a “god” but can be whatever you want that higher power to me. So I’m really looking for advice, insight and resources. Advice on if people think this makes sense for me. And resources on how to help me figure out if I am an alcoholic. Like quizzes or readings to help with this? Not sure what I’m looking for but hopefully someone has some insight. As you could probably can tell, I feel pretty lost and confused about what to do but maybe I don’t have to decide right now and just go through the motions of AA as a way to help with my problems?

I’m having a major issue with my Philips EP4349/70 coffee machine — it won’t turn on **at all**. No lights, no sounds, nothing, as if it’s completely dead.

Here’s what I’ve tried so far:

* Unplugged and replugged the power cable
* Tried multiple power outlets
* Pressed the power button in different ways (with different fingers, holding for several seconds)
* Tried holding the button after reconnecting the power
* Put the LatteGo on and off

Unfortunately, nothing works.

I'll receive a new third-party power cable tomorrow but I doubt It'll do the trick...

For context, I already had to send the machine in for a **pump replacement** once before (still under warranty at the time). Now it’s out of warranty — I bought it in 2022 for around €700 — and Philips support over the phone wasn’t helpful. They only suggested sending it in for repair at a flat rate of **€150**, with no guarantees.

That’s two major issues in under three years for an expensive machine, which is really disappointing.

Has anyone experienced something similar or found a fix for this kind of issue?

I met this girl on tinder ( not the greatest way) and we hit it of. She is smart,beautiful and was really fun to hang out with. We had a few beers that night and had a lot to talk about and i was really attracted to her. After we finished we went to my car as we wanted to go for a ride and my car had an oil spill. So i just told her its better for her if she just went home cause she lived near by. She just took her bag and said bye as i was calling the mechanic so i could drop of the car to get it fixed. ( honestly i didnt like that she just left like that cause but i was like ""no problem. We just met and you wanted to go home. No need to ask me how im dropping of the car or just chilling with me for a sec till i figure it out)... after a few times as we met up i noticed that she has a lot of expirience and that she, underneith all her confidence,one really insecure and sad person. I told her i was scared of her in a joking way and she laughed and i laughed.. it was really fun hanging out with her.. one night i had a dream about her and in my dream she was this cute and lovable demon peaking behind a wardrobe in my room. I was scared of her but i still reached with my hand and carresed her face and she burried it in my palm. I told her about it and we laugh it of...i continued hanging out with her and one day as i was hanging out with my friend at the country side ( there was no phone reception there and i texted this girl that i'll pick her up when her shift is over)... so i drive back to the city and she is not answering..i call a few more times and she just hangs up. At this point it was maybe like a month since we started talking. I havent deleted my tinder account but i wasnt seeing anyone else but this girl and i had no intention on matching someone on tinder... tomorrow day,since i though this girl ghosted me,i go back to tinder and i find her profile there with her profilw pic being one pic that she sent me a few days before where she looks all cute and sexy.. of course i dont want to match with her cause i thought it was over... and then i match with some girl and we started talking. I got a weird feeling in my stomach and i was thinking that this could be her with a fake profile... and guess what!? It was!!! 😅 so she calls me on my phone and says ""this girl is very pretty isnt she!? "" i was very into this girl and i knew this wasnt normal how she behaved but also some of my behaviour wasnt completely on point.. we start seeing eachother again.. she talks to her ex,i talk to my ex..we both get jealous. We search eachothers phones. Find out things about eachother and i was honestly ok with her talking to her ex cause i was also doing it and i told her about it..but when i asked her if she is talking to her ex she said no and then when she was showing me something on her phone he messaged her. It wasnt anything serious pf sexual it was just some random update on his life or something like that. I find out she met up with him to get some stuff from their appartment when... and im still saying i was ok with that cause i also had to meet up with my ex cause she was coming to get her stuff from abroad. She then starts to freak out and starts saying how i was going to sleep with my ex ( my ex is africanamerican woman) and how i have some perverted fetish for dark skinned women.. she got insecure after she told me she worked at the tanning salon and i asked her if she could tan for free and she said yes but its very unhealty..then i jokingly said ""mmm you would look great with a tan"" and we laugh it of... she begins acting crazy few weeks later. Starts calling me pervert and starts saying how im bot attracted to her..how i wanted to change her cause i made an appointment for her to do her nails. I told her i did that cause i just wanted to do something nice for her and not cause i didnt like her natural nails... we have these situations on and off and i get really insecure about our relationship.. i mentioned to her that i was with my ex for 8 years and that she is africanamerican and that i was attracted to dark skinned girls ( it was a fetish of mine tbh cause where i live there arent any other ethnicities except whites) but i wasnt with her because she was black ( my ex ex)... and before i even told her this this girl told me she was into older guys when she wqs younger and how she used to date drug dealers and some rich pick up playboy guy and she was in open relationship with him ( wich i know she didnt like that but i guess she was just looking for love and someone to be there for her)... i was yet again ok with that. I was trying to not bring that up and let her show me how she is now as a person and as a girlfriend.... but she kept getting way to insecure about my ex.. she called me pervert,called me shallow.. made me feel insecure on every level. She invited me to the place she used to work at for coffee and i knew she hooked up with some guys there.. one was a guest ( she tried sleeping with him but i guess thaz didnt end up well cause he kinda couldnt get it up) and the other one was her 19 yo coworker and they were just like making out and shit.. she accused me of hooking up with my female coworkers and with my female best friend even before i knew about her hook ups..so that was kinda telling me what she was doing at work.. but i go and have coffee there anyway.. i mean why not. I just wished she told me about it. If she was getting insecure about me hooking up with my.coworkers then why is she bringing me there for coffee and letting me talk to them without telling me that she hooked up with them... at this point i wqs giving up and my ex was about to come soon. I was never planning on sleeping with my ex but i knew this relationship had no future. She later found out that i cheated.. she then starts talking about her ex and how she cheated on him too and how he forgave her. He then cheated on her one year after that. She stayed with him but she told me while she was mad at me how she would hook up with his coworkers and how she would go home and kiss him all sloppy...she even said she still has a pic of them together. And how she is proud of that.. i told her im sorry i cheated on her and that i dont know why i did it...but i did it cause i had no faith in her. I wanted to have faith and i did but she also had no faith in me. She kept arguing with me and getting all.insecure.. i couldnt do it anymore...i told her after she found out i cheated that she should break up with me..she didnt want to and i still wanted to be with this girl.. she fell in depression after that and was snapping at me al the time. I wqs trying to fix my mistake i was holding it all up inside me. My rage,my dissapointment,i was carrying finnancial burden cause she wasnt working back then. She called me lazy,with no ambitions.. i was working two jobs.. as a waiter and im starting my own woodshop bussines. Sometimes i would support my father too financially and buy him food. I couldnt register my car cause i had other priorities.. few days ago before break up she told me how i should help more with.money as she is working now ( last month i didnt have as much money for rent and bills but was still buying food and other things). She was upset how i bought her flowers even though she obviously liked them.. i did that a few times and she then told me how im wasting money... all my efforts were not seen and it all felt like i was throwing it in a bottomless pit. I took her carting cause she said we never do anything and then she freaked out how i wasted money even though she seemed like she had fun. I bought her gifts i listened to her talking for hours.. i was there for her but it was never enough. I just wanted to see her happy and actually have some hope for life even if she wasnt with me. I told her i will pay for her therapy and that she needs to get up and do something. I was yelling at her cause all my soft talk couldnt reach her and she wouldnt try anymore. She gave up on everything. She gave up on me,she gave up on herself. She is only 25 but she beats herself for not being succesful in live. Always worrying about things and never having hope. I couldnt do it anymore. She was beliteling me,the job i was starting and working on. The job that fed us and payed our bills. I told her i will find money for therapy at least twice a month and how she needs to start taking anxiety medications and she didnt want to. I was yelling at her and i felt so sorry for her. I saw all her pain and all her dissappointments as she was filled with rage sitting on the bed with dead look in her eyes. She wanted all of that. She wanted therapy and to feel better but somethinh was stopping her... and i had no more strenght for the both of us. I was empty!

1lzrkxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1lzrkxy/stomach_gripping_was_part_of_the_cause/,Stomach Gripping was (part of) the cause,"Definitely not completely cured yet but feel 60% better and that’s huge for me considering that my SIBO was really bad. 

Symptoms / diagnosis: could not eat anything beyond animal protein and rice / gluten free bread. No coffee or tea either. Tested positive for hydrogen. Constant cramps / nausea / fatigue/ diarrhea which turns into constipation / etc if ingesting anything remotely not SIBO friendly. Symptoms would last for days. 

What I’ve done: 

1) oregano for 1 month + probiotics: mixed results. Some improvement but not enough to make a dent. 
2) Xifaxan + iberogast for 20 days: no improvement during treatment 
3) continued iberogast + coffee with fiber supplement in the morning to boost motility + stomach breathing explained below (!!!) - ten days after the Xifaxan course felt immense relief. Regular bowel movement / no pain after eating pears, apples, apricots. Haven’t tried all food groups yet but for reference pears used to give me cramps so severe I’d be out for 2 days. 


For full transparency I do think Xifaxan played a role in my recovery. I don’t know why i only felt it after the course and not during like most people, but I attribute that to both my post-course protocol and maybe the fact that Xifaxan made me constipated in general which hurt my motility in the moment I was taking it. 

Now onto stomach breathing: 
It turns out I was holding in my stomach the entire time and I had no idea you’re not supposed to do that (I thought that’s what people did naturally when standing?????). 

It’s apparently called stomach gripping or hourglass syndrome and can cause a lot of bad side effects including acid reflux and neck pain. Mind you this is not the same as just having a flat stomach or sucking it in a little bit or something. I am always breathing through the chest and will be working with physio to correct my posture and breathing. The first days of trying to relax my abdominal muscles brought relief but also pain similar to after-exercise cramps to my diaphragm since it has been cramped in one position day-in, day-out. 

Positives aside from the obvious: my anxiety levels went down significantly and in the first hours of consciously making my stomach relax I could hear the gurgling of my stomach and finally felt like food was moving instead of being stuck for ages. 

In conclusion: sometimes the cause is mechanical and fixing it is the only thing that will bring relief. Anxiety and stress are bad yes, but if the anxiety you feel also causes you to tense your stomach all the time it becomes a vicious circle. Sucking in your stomach all the time is not a normal way to stand or walk and poor posture will make you keep having the same problem over and over again. Hope my experience helps someone realize what the problem for them is even if it’s not identical to mine. Cheers!",2,1752511701.0,SIBO,0,1.0,False

1lzrb86,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1lzrb86/5_sales_book_lessons_that_weirdly_help_me_adult/,5 Sales Book Lessons That Weirdly Help Me Adult Better (Not Just For Business),"Adulting is basically this:
→ Waking up one day and realizing nobody gave you a manual.

Bills, relationships, work, mental health… it’s all on you.

Weirdly enough, the closest thing I ever found to a “manual” came from sales books.

I know, sounds cringe. But hear me out.

I work in social media and manage accounts that pull over 100 million views a month. (Yeah, my job sounds cooler than it is — it’s mostly coffee, analytics, and existential crises at 3am).

But the books that helped me handle adult life better weren’t social media guides. They were classic sales books — because they’re actually about human psychology.

Here are 5 things I stole from them that made me less of a hot mess:

⸻

1. Start With WHY (Simon Sinek)

→ People care less about what you do, more about why you do it.
→ Applies to friendships, jobs, even arguing with your landlord.
→ Example: Instead of saying “I want a raise,” say “I love working here because X, and I want to keep contributing at a higher level.” Changes everything.

⸻

2. Pattern Interrupts (Oren Klaff — Pitch Anything)

→ Our brains tune out predictable stuff.
→ Throw people a curveball and you get their attention.
→ Even saying “Can I be super honest?” in a convo makes people listen closer.

⸻

3. Mirroring (Chris Voss — Never Split the Difference)

→ Repeat the last 2-3 words someone says.
→ Makes them feel heard and calms arguments.
→ It works scarily well with partners, bosses, or customer support agents who won’t refund your deposit.

⸻

4. Tell Tiny Stories (Donald Miller — Building a StoryBrand)

→ People remember stories, not facts.
→ Even a tiny story in a text or email makes people connect better.
→ “I used to be terrified to speak up in meetings… then I tried X… now I’m the go-to person.” Feels real.

⸻

5. The Consistency Principle (Robert Cialdini — Influence)

→ People want to stay consistent with what they’ve said before.
→ Start small: “Hey, can I get your quick opinion on this?”
→ Small yes → bigger yes. Also works when negotiating chores with roommates.

⸻

These aren’t just sales tactics. They’re life tactics.

I still screw up daily — but this stuff genuinely makes adulting feel less impossible.

Anyone else use weird books or psychology tricks to keep life together? Drop yours below. I love collecting these hacks.

P.S. I’m taking on one new social media client in July if anyone’s curious how this stuff applies online. No pressure though — just happy to answer questions for free if I can help anyone here figure out this adulting chaos.

So I looked up things to buy actually debating doing this since being out there by yourself can be a little scary and pulled the trigger.

Now I enjoyed myself and I'd call this a success but I would also call this a learning experience. My plan was to hike up and camp near the base of the Peak and it was just another brutal 2300ft to the summit the next day after camping. So as I try to go to sleep I couldn't, I realized being 9700ft in elevation I had trouble sleeping because of how thin the air was up there. So I toss and turn all night and I'm sure I got about 3 hours of sleep. I woke up around 6am ish and made coffee still feeling worn out and decided not to climb the rest of the way and just sit and stare at some mountains.

Overall I had a great time doing this and was glad I did and I'd do it again and I'm probably gonna give this peak another shot.",29,1752511001.0,backpacking,8,1.0,False

I am serious need of some help in reaching the mental states for manifestation.  
Background:  
I have ADHD and I am in huge debts around 60k USD. I took for starting my business, not to say it didn't work as expected but gave huge lessons and honestly I am grateful for those lessons. I am a freelancer and I work with my sister, so no fix monthly incomes, and right now I can't take a job, because the pay is so less and work hours are so high that I won't be able to pay my debts with them. My debts are from bank, CCs, Friends and family.

The issue is I am constantly get calls, sometimes threatening, sometimes humiliating. This derails my mental states. I kind of live in constant fear and desperation.  
And i can't achieve the state and feelings that are needed to manifest the right things.

A simple math if I get x amount of clients when I make my service cost less than the market, i would be out of mess. I can raise my prices later. It has partially worked, I get leads but I believe this fear is delaying things for me.

A client who almost agreed to work on last month 8th June, is still doing research. If he had signed with me last june, I would have paid atleast a little to some people and wouldn't be so stressed. But the more I want him to pay soon, the more delay he does. He get's busy or something else happens. He said we will finalize early next week. And to on call to my debtors I said early next week I will pay and then the client gets busy and it again gets delayed.

I get reply like I was waiting for an offer like this, and then the client say they are busy at the moment, but let's keep the conversation going and then book the call for mid of september. 2 months later.

Because everything I say happens, If I say a nursery rhyme in some context out of nowhere, within few hrs I listen to a song made of rhyme which I had no idea existed. If I say let's have a coffee to my sister, and then while going to prepare coffee she opens instagram, and the first post she sees, will have a title if you are working and your coworker asks for coffee. And every single day atleast 10 to twenty such incident happen.

Just three years back I used to pride myself in 100% timely payments. Whatever I said, whatever time I said, I always paid before time. My credit score used to be the max possible. And now my credit score has dropped to 300. At times there are months I don't receive any payments.

So I really need help on how to do it. Just believe it, is not working because I don't even remember what it was like to be debt free. And when every few minutes you see calls on your phone from your creditors. even if you don't pick some of those calls, they still increase stress and fear.

-Mewing. When in resting position, keep tongue on the roof of my mouth, keep lips sealed, and breathe through nose. I also give myself a slight underbite when resting, the theory being it releases the TMJ joint from being jammed up (it also makes it almost impossible to clinch your jaw). This all seems impossible at first, but it becomes natural if you stay disciplined. I do all this only in the resting position, I go back to natural jaw alignment when I eat and talk. 

-Mouth guard and mouth tape at night. I got a fitted mouth guard for teeth grinding and I use the mouth tape to help promote nose breathing throughout the night. I’m a bad teeth grinder, snorer, and mouth breather at night. I’ve learned to sleep on my back where I’m not putting pressure on my jaw throughout the night. 

-Reduce stress. My most intense pain seemed to be associated when I was stressed the most. Also cutting down my coffee intake to one small cup in the morning has seemed to help. 

I felt very helpless at certain points the last year, but I am optimistic and doing much better currently. ",11,1752510802.0,TMJ,1,1.0,False

Just three years back I used to pride myself in 100% timely payments. Whatever I said, whatever time I said, I always paid before time. My credit score used to be the max possible. And now my credit score has dropped to 300. At times there are months I don't receive any payments.

So I really need help on how to do it. Just believe it, is not working because I don't even remember what it was like to be debt free. And when every few minutes you see calls on your phone from your creditors. even if you don't pick some of those calls, they still increase stress and fear.

Guys Please help me.

UPDATE: EDIT  
I just posted this. I had a goal of earning 75000 USD so that I will have paid my debts and have a little cushion for future. I posted this and went to reddit home just now and this is the post I see.

1lzr3v4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_soapahappcom/comments/1lzr3v4/introduction_to_handmade_soap/,Introduction to Handmade Soap,"Handmade soap is a type of soap crafted through traditional methods. Unlike commercial soaps, it often contains natural ingredients and lacks harsh chemicals. This appeal lies in the personalization of scents, colors, and textures, making each bar unique. Many people enjoy choosing essential oils like Lavender or Peppermint to enhance their bathing experience. Additionally, handmade soap is often better for the skin, promoting a gentler cleanse.



The history of soap making dates back thousands of years. Ancient civilizations, including the Babylonians and Egyptians, discovered the benefits of cleansing with fats and ashes. Over time, soap making evolved with various techniques and ingredients. The introduction of chemical processes in the 19th century made mass production possible, leading to the commercial soap we see today. However, the artisanal approach to soap crafting has seen a resurgence in recent years as consumers seek more natural products.

Using handmade soap has several advantages over commercial options. First, handmade soaps often retain glycerin, a natural byproduct that moisturizes the skin. This makes them less drying compared to many commercial soaps that strip the skin of moisture. Additionally, handmade soaps can be customized to fit specific skin types and preferences. Readers of this article will learn about the basic techniques of crafting handmade soap, the necessary ingredients, and tips for creating unique blends. They will also discover the tools needed and safety precautions to consider in this rewarding craft.

# Essential Ingredients for Soap Making

# Overview of Common Soap-Making Oils

When crafting handmade soap, the choice of oils plays a critical role in the final product. Different oils contribute unique properties to the soap, affecting texture, lather, and moisturizing qualities. Here are some common oils used in soap making:

1. **Olive Oil**: Known for its moisturizing properties, olive oil results in a gentle and creamy soap. It is often used in combination with other oils to enhance the soap's benefits.
2. **Coconut Oil**: This oil creates a bubbly lather and hardens the soap. It also has cleansing properties, making it popular in many soap recipes.
3. **Palm Oil**: Palm oil is used to create a firm bar of soap with a smooth texture. It is often blended with other oils for balanced results.

Using a mix of these oils can yield a well-rounded soap that cleanses and nourishes the skin effectively.

# Importance of Lye and Safety Precautions

Lye, or sodium hydroxide, is essential for the saponification process, where oils turn into soap. However, handling lye requires caution due to its caustic nature. Always wear protective gear, such as gloves and goggles, when working with lye. In addition, always add lye to water, not the other way around, to prevent dangerous reactions. Store lye in a safe place, away from children and pets.

Before starting your soap-making journey, familiarize yourself with proper lye handling techniques. Utilize a digital scale for accurate measurements and ensure your workspace is well-ventilated. By taking these safety precautions, you can enjoy the soap-making process with confidence, knowing you are minimizing risks.

# Natural Colorants and Fragrances

To enhance the aesthetics of your soap, consider using natural colorants and fragrances. Colorants can come from various sources, such as:

* **Herbs and Spices**: Ingredients like turmeric, paprika, and spirulina can add vibrant colors.
* **Clays**: Natural clays not only provide color but also contribute skin benefits.

For fragrances, essential oils are an excellent option. They come in various scents, like Lavender, Peppermint, and Rosemary, providing an aromatic cleansing experience. These natural options are preferable to synthetic fragrances, as they are kinder to the skin. In addition to aesthetics, essential oils also impart unique properties to the soap.

# Possible Additives for Unique Properties

Additives can enhance your soap's qualities, making it unique. Common additives include:

* **Exfoliants**: Ingredients like oatmeal, coffee grounds, or poppy seeds provide gentle exfoliation.
* **Herbs**: Dried herbs can add texture and natural benefits, such as chamomile for soothing properties.
* **Essential Oils**: Beyond fragrance, essential oils can offer therapeutic effects, like tea tree oil for its antibacterial properties.

Experimenting with these additives allows you to personalize your soap. Keep in mind to research the properties of each additive to achieve the desired effect.

# Tools and Equipment Needed

# Essential Tools for Soap Making

To get started with crafting handmade soap, having the right tools is essential. Here’s a list of the key tools you will need:

* **Mixing Bowls**: These are crucial for combining your oils and lye. Use stainless steel or glass bowls for best results.
* **Scale**: A digital scale ensures precise measurements of ingredients, which is vital for successful soap making.
* **Thermometer**: A thermometer helps you monitor the temperature of your lye and oils, ensuring they are at the correct degrees for mixing.
* **Stick Blender**: This tool is essential for achieving trace quickly. A stick blender allows you to blend oils and lye efficiently.
* **Soap Calculator (**[Soapah](https://soapahapp.com/)**)**: Soapah is an all-in-one app that helps soap makers make their own formulations or use many of the ready-to-go, tried-and-true formulas already added.

# Safety Gear for Protection

In soap making, safety should always be a priority. Here are some recommended safety gear items:

* **Gloves**: Wear sturdy gloves to protect your hands from lye, which can cause burns. Use nitrile gloves for the best protection.
* **Goggles**: Protect your eyes from splashes while mixing the lye. Safety goggles are a must-have for this process.
* **Masks**: A mask can protect your lungs from fumes when working with lye. It’s particularly important to wear one when mixing lye with water.

# Molds and Storage Solutions

The choice of molds can affect the final look of your soap. Here are some common types:

* **Silicone Molds**: These molds are flexible and easy to use. They allow for easy removal of soap and come in various shapes.
* **Wood Molds**: Wooden molds are sturdy and can produce larger batches of soap. They may require lining to prevent sticking.
* **Plastic Molds**: These are lightweight and come in many designs. They are affordable and can produce fun shapes.

For storage, consider these solutions:

* **Ingredient Storage**: Use airtight containers to store oils, lye, and additives to keep them fresh and prevent moisture.
* **Finished Soap Storage**: Store your soaps in a cool, dry place. A box or bin with ventilation is ideal for preventing humidity damage.

# Step-by-Step Soap Making Process

# Understanding Cold Process vs. Hot Process Methods

Soap making can be done through two common methods: cold process and hot process. The cold process method involves mixing oils with lye at room temperature. This method allows for greater control over the ingredients and the final product. It creates soap that retains the natural properties of the oils used. On the other hand, the hot process method uses heat to accelerate saponification. This results in a more immediate soap product, but may lead to a different texture and appearance.

Both methods have their unique benefits. The cold process allows for intricate designs and swirls. It also retains the scent and properties of essential oils. The hot process can be quicker, allowing for immediate use of the soap. However, it may not present as many options for decorative designs. Choosing between these methods depends on personal preference and desired outcomes.

# Preparing the Lye Solution Safely

When making soap, safety is paramount. Begin by wearing gloves and goggles to protect yourself from lye. Measure the lye and water accurately in separate containers. Always add lye to water, not the other way around. This prevents dangerous reactions and splashes. Stir the mixture until the lye completely dissolves. Allow the solution to cool to a safe temperature, ideally between 90°F and 110°F (32°C and 43°C).

Once the lye solution is prepared, ensure that you are working in a ventilated area. Fumes can be harmful, so it's best to work outdoors or near a window. Check the temperature of your oils as well. The ideal temperature for combining lye and oils is roughly the same, between 95°F and 110°F (35°C and 43°C). Temperature consistency is key for successful saponification.

# Combining Oils and Lye: Tips for Achieving the Right Temperatures

After your lye solution has cooled, it’s time to combine it with your chosen oils. Measure your oils carefully and heat them gently until they reach the desired temperature. Use a thermometer to ensure accuracy. Once both the lye and oils are within the proper range, slowly pour the lye into the oils. Stir the mixture continuously to prevent any separation.

As you mix, you will notice the soap beginning to thicken. This is known as ""trace."" Achieving trace is crucial for ensuring that the oils and lye blend properly. Continue mixing until the trace is visible, which can take several minutes. Once you reach trace, you can add fragrances or colorants. Pour the mixture into molds, ensuring even distribution for uniformity. Cover the molds with a towel to keep the soap warm during curing.

# Pouring into Molds and the Curing Process Duration

Pour the soap mixture into pre-prepared molds. Tap the molds gently to remove any air bubbles. Allow the soap to set for 24 to 48 hours before unmolding. The soap will harden during this time. Once removed from molds, cut the soap into bars using a sharp knife. Ensure the bars are even in size for a professional appearance.

The curing process takes about four to six weeks. This duration allows excess water to evaporate and for the saponification process to complete. Store the soaps in a cool, dry place during this time. Proper curing is essential to improve the quality and longevity of your soap.

# Cutting and Storing Soap Properly After Curing

After the curing period, your soap is ready to be cut and stored. Use a sharp knife or a soap cutter to slice the bars evenly. Properly cut soap not only looks appealing but also allows for even drying and aging. Store the bars in a well-ventilated area, away from direct sunlight. This helps maintain their quality and fragrance.

You can package your soap in eco-friendly materials if you plan to gift or sell it. Using breathable packaging prevents moisture accumulation. Proper storage conditions ensure your handmade soap remains fresh and ready for use. By following these steps, you’ll create beautiful, functional bars of soap.

# Tips for Success and Troubleshooting

# Common Issues in Soap Making

Crafting handmade soap can be fulfilling, yet beginners may face common challenges. One frequent issue is overheating, which can lead to unsightly changes in texture. To avoid this, it is advisable to use a thermometer to monitor temperatures carefully. If you notice your soap mix starting to overheat, remove it from the heat immediately and allow it to cool down before proceeding with the next steps.

Another common problem is separation, where the oils and lye do not combine properly. This can happen due to incorrect measurements or mixing at the wrong temperature. To solve this, ensure you measure ingredients accurately. Mixing should be done at the recommended temperature, around 100-110°F for most recipes. If separation occurs, you can try re-blending the mixture to see if it comes together. If it doesn't, you may need to start over.

# Adjusting Recipes for Different Skin Types

When making soap, it's important to consider the unique needs of different skin types. Oily skin may benefit from a soap recipe that includes clay or charcoal, which can help absorb excess oil. For dry skin, adding moisturizing ingredients like shea butter or olive oil can help alleviate dryness and provide nourishment.

Additionally, you can adjust the recipe based on personal preferences. For example, if someone prefers a lighter scent, you can reduce the amount of fragrance oil used. Experimenting with different combinations allows for the creation of personalized products. Testing your soap on different skin types can also guide you in refining your recipes.

# Experimenting with Scents and Textures

Personalizing your handmade soap goes beyond just functional adjustments. The art of crafting soap includes experimenting with scents and textures. You can try essential oils like Lavender or Peppermint for varied aromatherapy benefits. Mixing in natural exfoliants such as oatmeal or coffee grounds can also enhance texture.

Gather feedback from friends and family after they try your soap. Their opinions provide valuable insights into scent strength and texture preferences. This step can help you improve your products and cater to a broader audience. Documenting their feedback can guide future batches and inspire new ideas.

# Conclusion and Additional Resources

Making handmade soap offers numerous benefits. It allows you to control the ingredients, which leads to skin-friendly products. You can create unique scents and styles tailored to your preferences. Crafting soap can also be a relaxing hobby that provides a sense of accomplishment. The ability to customize recipes means you can cater to specific skin types or personal tastes.

Hey everyone. I’m new here in Quezon City — just moved recently after years of living a pretty structured, conservative life.

I’m 27, male, educated and I've spent most of my life chasing goals and trying to “play it safe.” But lately, something’s shifted. Maybe it’s the freedom of being in a new city, or just the realization that I haven’t really explored who I am outside of work and expectations.

I’ve always leaned into the softer, more sensual side of things when it comes to connection. I’m not into anything aggressive or loud — I find comfort in slow touch, soft skin, whispered things. I guess you could say I’m curious, respectful, and open… and I’d like to meet people who get that.

Not really sure what I’m looking for, to be honest. Maybe just conversation, maybe more. But definitely honest, safe, and mutual. If you’re someone who values energy, vibe, and exploration without judgment , I’d like to hear from you.

Open to coffee, conversation, or just being around people who are also figuring themselves out. If you've got any advice on safe spaces in QC for chill but curious folks or you’re someone who’d like to chat, feel free to message or comment.

1lzr2sd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lzr2sd/aita_for_quitting_my_abusive_job_without_another/,AITA for quitting my abusive job without another job lined up?,"So I’ve been at this restaurant for about 9 weeks. I got hired on as Assistant General Manager and on my second week the standing General Manager quit and I got promoted.

The owner is extremely involved with the operations of the restaurant. Like in EVERYTHING. He has to approve every change even if it’s placement of a trash can or how things are plated. Which is fine, he’s the owner, but he also has almost ZERO restaurant experience and is very unprofessional in how he communicates his wishes. He yells, curses, slams his fists down in his desk while he’s frustrated, he insults the staff (including myself) on their bodies, appearance, and directs(mushes) them in a really condescending manner. 

He has come in to throw tantrums multiple times because a table wasn’t bussed as quickly as he would like or because sales are low and he believes that to be my fault/responsibility directly. (I’m not in charge of marketing or events, that would be his girlfriend who comes in to micromanage my staff all the time with ZERO restaurant experience and is also very rude. A lot of staff has come to me complaining about her and even some guests)

I came in to the restaurant on my off time with my partner to have a coffee after a date last week. While we’re sitting, the owner walks up to me and tells me he “needs to talk to me outside”. I awkwardly tell my partner I’ll be right back and follow him outside to the parking lot where he begins to raise his voice and tell me how he’s very mad at me because there are tables that need to be bussed for more than 2 minutes and some of the bottles in the bar didn’t have pour spouts (we have something like 80 bottles of spirits and some we don’t pour for weeks). He tells me the sales are terrible and that the labor is too high (the schedule is only posted with his approval and he basically makes the schedule anyway) My AGM/Bar Manager is managing the shift mind you. So I don’t understand why he didn’t just talk to my AGM/Bar Manager who was on duty and I definitely don’t understand why he felt it necessary/ok to yell at me about any of this while I’m on my off time with my partner.

Most recently, I show up to work and see that there are 2 people I’ve never met or seen before managing and delegating my staff. I approach them and ask who they are and how I can help them, the man responds with telling me him and his wife are “friends of the owner”. I say, “ok, well we’re happy to meet you. May I ask why you’re delegating my staff?” And he responds with “I would love to speak with you about that privately if you time?” I just say ok and sit down with him. He tells me he and his wife are restaurant consultants hired by the owner to help the restaurant be more successful. He proceeds to ask what I feel the restaurant needs and even promises anonymity if I’m more comfortable. Im so caught off guard that I humor him and I proceed to tell him everything I think would make the place run better, which I’ve told to the owner already multiple times before. I tell him that the main issue is that no one wants to stay employed here for more than 2-3 months due to pay and work conditions and because the owner is basically a bully. He seems sympathetic and even implies that the owner doesn’t respect me and the staff. He then disappears for a bit and then comes back saying the owner would like to speak with us privately at his office. He does this all the time. The owners office is in a garage building behind another business 4 doors down the street. It’s in a closed room with no windows and no cameras or anything. This is where a lot of the yelling happens. I tell the “consultant” who doesn’t know any basic fundamental industry standards or even terms like BOH or safety calls (behind, sharp!, corner, etc) that I don’t want to meet there and I’d be more comfortable meeting at the restaurant or somewhere open. He responds with “He’s the owner. Let’s go” and tries to steer me by putting his hand on my shoulder. This is where I’m growing VERY uncomfortable. For some reason, I forego my instincts and follow him to the office. When we sit down, the owner immediately starts conveying his disappointment and disagreement with my complaints. He doubles down and tells me he doesn’t give a shit about my “professional boundaries” and that it’s HIS business and he’s going to run it how HE sees fit. The wildest part is that the “consultant” starts to join in and basically mimic the owner and starts yelling at me too. Only when I cut them off and calmly ask “why are you yelling?” Do they stop and start to just reiterate their points at a lower volume.

I grew up in an abusive home so I can feel myself dissociating a lot at work and having to go cry in the bathroom or calm down my breathing when the panic sets in. 

Ive been job hunting for a couple weeks and I normally don’t have trouble finding work. I want to quit because I’m having anxiety attacks at work from my boss nitpicking, insulting, and yelling at me. My partner has been very supportive through this and even my previous company letting me go about 5 months ago but has told me that I CANNOT quit my job until I have another lined up so as to not have gap in paychecks. I personally feel like I can find a job very quickly especially if I’m hunting full time. With my current job I’m working 55-65 hours a week.

Am I the asshole for not listening to my partner and quitting now? ",1,1752510563.0,AITAH,0,0.67,False

1lzr1eg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lzr1eg,"Post, Tag, Repeat: Insight From Forty Flair Decisions","Over time, I’ve engaged with Reddit’s systems in various roles, but one specific function — assigning user flair — has emerged as a consistent and underappreciated interface for content clarity. This post serves to acknowledge that functionality across 40 distinct moments and reflect on how those decisions have supported user experience and moderation structure.

User flair operates as an indexing tool. Whether used to communicate roles, identities, content categories, or timestamps, it offers structural context that can reduce ambiguity and streamline content discovery. Throughout these 40 instances, the aim has remained consistent: apply accurate, context-aligned labels without obstructing user voice or post flow.

In managing flair, precision has been a priority. Applying the wrong tag, especially in rule-intensive subs, can create inconsistencies that impact searchability, visibility, and mod review. Learning how different communities interpret flair types — from conversational tone to media segmentation — has required adapting quickly while preserving each subreddit’s internal logic.

The experiences span a variety of subreddit types — entertainment-focused, analysis-driven, and data-led. Across each, moderation guidelines often differ, making uniform flair practice impractical. Instead, interpreting localized flair culture has proven more effective than applying broad frameworks.

Several instances involved the construction or revision of flair packs. These were typically requests for thematic expansion, rewording for clarity, or reorganizing flair lists to follow topical hierarchy. Feedback during these sessions showed that users often value conciseness over stylistic flair, and that practical taxonomy wins over clever phrasing.

There were also cases where flair was a corrective tool. When posts were miscategorized or lacked identifiers, applying or revising user flair helped restore topical relevance. It minimized mod intervention in some cases, allowing posts to proceed without deletion or reformatting.

Across the dataset of flair interactions, metadata tagging emerged as a secondary benefit. Consistent flair application improves downstream access through sorting, analytics, and trend review. While Reddit’s current infrastructure doesn’t always visualize this, it’s a backend layer that should be considered in platform-wide UX evolution.

Moderators across multiple subs have demonstrated a wide range of approaches to flair prioritization. Some utilize flair as a legal or eligibility tool, while others rely on it for cultural tone-setting. Understanding this distinction has helped refine how and where to engage in flair dialogue.

Several of the 40 instances also included building out flair documentation — plain language summaries of each tag’s intended use. These efforts reduce mod workload and give users autonomy in selecting the appropriate identifiers. Standardizing access to flair explanations could serve future interface improvements.

The project of identifying and applying flair isn’t always linear. Negotiating label overlap, resolving incomplete hierarchies, and submitting flair proposals require balancing form and function — usually in real time. It remains one of the more flexible tools available to subreddit contributors.

While 40 instances do not constitute a large sample across Reddit’s scale, they do offer micro-level insight into how labeling systems influence navigation and clarity. They also show how granular tools can become the backbone of broader conversations around post formatting, topic depth, and community values.

This acknowledgment simply records these moments and invites further discourse around improving flair systems across Reddit. Whether that involves reworking UI flow, increasing transparency, or giving contributors access to analytics tools, the end goal remains consistent: precision, relevance, and usability.",7,1752510474.0,Redditachievments,2,1.0,False

I've wondered on and off whether I have ADHD. I've always leaned towards no, bc I do very well academically, I never miss a deadline, and I've been told I'm uncannily good at remembering details. Sure my brain lowkey shuts down whenever I work on assignments...but I'm able to muscle through it. I thought this was just normal procrastination. Same with chores--no one wants to do chores...right?

I do have a habit of jumping between completely unrelated conversation topics, but I've always chalked this up to my potential autism. (My mom is a special ed teacher and she says I've always had signs.) Coffee also has little to no effect on me. I have racing thoughts too, but I've been diagnosed with anxiety/depression, so I thought it was just that. I'm on meds for it and they do help, but the adderall gave me a shocking level of calm.

Was this just the amphetamine euphoria? Is this a sign that I might have ADHD?",2,1752510435.0,mentalhealth,1,1.0,False

1lzqzk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/complainaboutanything/comments/1lzqzk3/people_make_way_to_much_noise/,People make way to much noise.,"I was with my partner in the middle of the work week at a park that is supposed to be like a tranquil respite from the city. We were poking around an empty beach looking at rocks and crabs and things and just having a nice, quiet little afternoon and a motor boat leaves the busy harbor to drop anchor a couple hundred feet off the shore. They proceeded to have loud conversations/arguments for half an hour, then turn on terrible rock music that was audible around that entire section of the park. So they boat into a quiet cove of a park they didn't pay admission to but we did, and proceed to destroy the peace for everyone. 

I could go on and on. You wake up on the first nice weekend morning of the spring, make your morning coffee and go to enjoy it on the patio and your neighbor decides to take advantage of the nice weather by blowing leaves around his yard for two hours. Ear-splittingly loud pipes. My downstairs neighbor that puts on loud music and then opens the door to the shared stairwell. My *other* neighbor that puts her dogs in a stroller on the front porch to yap all morning. The guy at my work who has a deep, loud voice who talks *nonstop.* Just walks into a room and starts talking, no matter what is going on in there. 

I don't understand why making all this noise that other people have to listen to is socially acceptable. It's like walking into a botanic garden and spraying silly string all over the plants, or taking the entire bucket of Halloween candy. Why is one person allowed to ruin the experiences of dozens of people around them? ",6,1752510361.0,complainaboutanything,1,1.0,False

I have actually had the most success this week on CMB.

I had zero matches on Hinge & POF. One match on Bumble, and three matches on CMB.

Just some observations from those three matches:

One sent me flowers! That was very sweet. They were sent on my first day, before I could barely finish my profile. We have been messaging every day since then and hope to meet for dinner this week.

Another, I Liked first and she Liked me second. I had assumed she would message me, since I know she received a “You Two Are A Match” notification. But she did not. So I started the conversation, expressing interest and giving her prompts to reply to. She replied with just “How are you.” It felt like pulling teeth to get her engaged. I was about to give up when she finally opened up a little. Still not sure if we will meet, she is not the best communicator. Sometimes she seems disinterested. Other times, her replies seem like they were written by someone else.

The third, I Liked first and she Liked second. Again, she did not message me. So I sent the first message, commenting on her profile and giving her prompts to reply to. No response yet, but it has only been a little over 12 hours.

Not sure what I am looking for by posting this. Just curious if anyone else has had similar experiences with CMB versus other apps? Is it common for people to Like a profile just to be polite or curious, with no real intent to connect? Or are people just bad communicators? ",3,1752510243.0,coffeemeetsbagel,1,1.0,False

I’ve been working independently in the creative and strategy space for more than a decade for brands and agencies and finally working on launching my own project in Berlin.  
It is a concept that blends physical space with culture, community, and creativity.  
It’s unlike anything currently on the map, and I’m looking for the right people to help bring it to life.



I’m currently looking for:

* **Co-founders/partners**, ideally people who’ve dreamt of running a creative space, café, or community hub, but want something with more soul and strategy behind it.
* **Investors**, early-stage folks who believe in the power of culture-led businesses and want to be part of something fresh from day one.
* **Any advice** that anyone can give me to link up with such people through forums, events or spaces.



What I am not looking for:

* **Unsolicited advice** on how Berlin doesn't need another cafe and/or a creative space.



I’m not sharing too much publicly just yet, but if you’re based in Berlin (or nearby), and you’re curious, drop me a message. Let’s chat over coffee.

What I learned writing and publishing my first LitRPG (besides how many ways a healer can die)","

**Body:**  
I just self-published my first book, and I expected to come out of it with a better grasp on pacing, grammar, and maybe trauma bonding with a coffee mug. Instead, I learned this:

1. **It’s incredibly easy to run out of Skill ideas.** Especially when your system can’t just slap a ""+5 Ice Damage"" on everything and call it a day. There's only so many ways to say “this makes you slightly better at not dying.”
2. **Creating the System was way harder than creating the story.** The plot? Cool. Characters? Messy, but they came together. The System? Every time I thought it made sense, I realized I’d accidentally created a cheat loop or broken my own lore.
3. **NPCs are more fun when they feel like people.** I'm not sure why this surprised me. I always bring some depths to the NPC's when I'm running modules.
4. **I became a better writer.** Not a *great* writer, but definitely better. Mostly by deleting the same paragraph six times and finally admitting it sounded smarter in my head.
5. **Microsoft Word’s Copilot is a freaking miracle.** I’m not being paid to say this. It fixed so many “you already used that word eight times this page” moments before they reached readers.
6. **My own characters started surprising me.** I built them. I gave them their skills and classes and tragic backstories.  I don't understand how they surprise me, but they do. 
7. **Publishing is euphoric.** Even if no one reads it. Even if it bombs. Hitting “publish” and knowing I made a thing—that feeling’s sticking with me for a while.

Anyway, just wanted to share. Appreciate this community for being part of the background noise that got me over the finish line.

Or someone,"I matched with this person and we had been talking for at least a month but they seemed very reserved and restricted by time. We agreed to go on a date at a coffee shop but the day before they asked if we could meet at a grocery store before. This is where she works

When we met they were late but came to my car. They told me they were being tracked by their roommate and boss (same person) and couldn't leave but we could talk in the car. She thinks her car is bugged, that her roommate is dangerous, he has guns,, but she does additional side jobs for him (commercial cleaning /painting) that pays her a decent amount of money.  I tried to get her to leave with me but she didn't want to. That was maybe 3 weeks ago

 For the last week she has had almost no communication with me but I see she is online a lot. This is somewhat normal as she insisted her communicating with me had to be discrete.

We haven't video talked for a week and she hasn't responded to me for several days. I understand this is a very odd situation. I'm thinking she is probably not in danger, maybe this is an elaborate way of ghosting? 

I guess I feel bad to cut her off but this whole situation is really affecting my headspace. She lives and works an hour away so I don't want to drive there unnecessarily especially not knowing her work schedule

Any ideas? Should I be expecting a request for a big sum of money soon? 

I thought of getting her a clean phone and a prepaid plan, maybe putting it in a bank deposit box and just give her a key and a note in person if her phone is compromised. That's if I even went to her work and she was there",2,1752510122.0,datingadvice,2,1.0,False

You were the one who said you loved sex, that it made you feel wanted and close. You told me you wanted it every day, that it was part of how you expressed love and connection. I believed you. I leaned into that because I thought it was something we both shared. But now it feels like even that is being twisted into another reason to keep me at arm’s length.

I wish you could have seen the bigger picture. I wasn’t there just for your body. I was there for your mind, your heart, your soul, the parts of you kept locked away no matter how gently I knocked. I asked you over and over what you were feeling, what you were thinking, because I wanted to know you deeply. But every time, I was met with silence or another excuse for why you couldn’t talk to me.

I tried to build something real with you. I was the one who cooked dinner, the one who brought you coffee and breakfast, the one who was planning trips for us, all while you did nothing but show up. I tried to give you space when you needed it and closeness when you craved it. But intimacy isn’t just physical, it’s emotional, too. And I felt like I was the only one fighting for that part of us by rubbing your back nightly just to feel you. 

I wish you had let me show you in more ways how much I cared. Because in my heart, I was never there just for the physical, I was there for you the best was I could. ",6,1752510042.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,1,1.0,False
