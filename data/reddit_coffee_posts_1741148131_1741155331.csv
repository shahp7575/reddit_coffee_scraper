Partner and I have been looking to meet new friends kasi bago lang kami dito sa place namin (South) and malayo na sa family/walang kakilala here. Gala lang kami nang gala every weekend pero super boring kapag weekdays naman :(

So wala super sponty lang, baka gusto niyo makipagmeet now over coffee para makapagchikahan tayo?

Happy chika or even rants/issues go lang! Purely SFW lang please. Madaldal ako and si Partner sakto rin sa chika. Pwedeng alone ka or group kayo basta mabubuti kayong tao gusto pa namin mabuhay nang matagal 😅

We just want to socialize/interact w/ other human beings.

We have a car and we can fetch you but if super layo mo let’s talk if you can pitch in sa gas kahit minimal lang?

Then sa overnight no pressure if hindi naman mangyari. We can all go home before our shift starts (nightshift/GY). Wala lang if sponty ka rin na tao like us (one time pagkagising namin may sweldo na so biglang natripan namin magpunta ng Vigan kahit weekday and magstay there for the rest of the week kasi super bored talaga kami dito sa bahay) we can book a biglaang BNB (we can go dutch) na may malakas na wifi so we can all co-work/co-study together while nagchichikahan. For context, purely remote kasi ung work namin and again nightshift/gy.

We can exchange ID’s + if may suggestion kapa on how to ensure ung safety rin sana ng bawat isa. Thank you so much!",1,1741155251.0,PhR4Friends,0,1.0,False

TLDR: The Federal Government has:

·       left ***us*** super, super unprotected;

·       disliked by ***our*** allies for turning “our” backs on them and ***our*** promises

·       started hooking up with ***our*** enemies and;

·       said things for show to win the election and continue to bend the truth to the American people’s faces

We are really sick and tired of the *unbelievable* bullshit and it’s only been *four weeks.*.

In the same spirit to hopefully kick off a peaceful, modern-day 'revolution' of the American People, we would like to propose the following Call to Action:

Petition Governor Ferguson to order ALL Washington State Government officials – **specifically including local law enforcement and federal military reserve troops** – to protect the Washingtonian working class’ participation in a ***Federal Tax Strike*** by allowing Washington citizens to redirect federally paid tax dollars to Washington State instead. This strike is in response to Benedict Trump’s indefinite hold on federal funds for anyone (individual, organization, and/or state) who does not align with his fascist administration’s policies.

Minsan napapaisip ako, ano bang pumasok sa isip ko noon? Anyway, I'll just share our expenses so far to give others an idea, especially those planning to have their wedding there.

We're tying the knot this year, and we booked most of our major suppliers last year. Our initial budget was 500k for 150 guests — ngayon, nasa 900k na kami and counting.

The first thing we booked was the venue + catering package which already took almost 500k of our budget. Why we pushed through ay kasi maganda siya nung binisita namin at masarap yung food huhu. The package includes:

Venue rental
Catering for 150 pax
Basic stage and backdrop styling
Grazing table for 100 pax
Bridal car (3 hours)
Wedding cake (3-tiered)
Lights and sounds
Ceiling treatment (freebie)
Photobooth (unli for 2 hours)
3D2N accommodation for 2 (pero hindi namin gagamitin for prep since we booked a different prep area)

The remaining budget went to these suppliers and expenses:

Church fees
Coordinator / OTD coordinator
Host
Photo & video team
Florist (church only)
HMUA
Prenup shoot (we spent 100k here with PV, HMUA, venue, props, and outfits)
Wedding rings (Ongpin)
Wedding gown (Divisoria)
Wedding suit
Wedding shoes (SM)
Entourage outfits
Coffee cart
Prep area for entourage and family
Prep photoshoot fee
Invitations (mostly e-invites)
Marriage documents

Pending pa namin i-book or bayaran:

- Crew meals & Survival kits
- Entourage HMUA (although sobrang thankful ako na my bridesmaids agreed to help out on this)
- PS gifts

What we considered before but decided to let go to save on costs:

- Wedding souvenirs
- Singer/band
- Perfume bar
- Mobile bar
- Entourage gifts

Honestly, I feel like we've already cut down on a lot of things (hopefully without sacrificing quality) — pero almost 1M na siya with just the basics. We chose yung mga walang OOTF and clarified na walang hidden fees pero namamahalan pa rin ako sa total. Hopefully it all goes well pampalubag loob naman. Nakakabaliw!

1j3wdey,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1j3wdey/period_and_emotional_regulation/,Period and Emotional Regulation,"I’ve noticed as I’ve moved into my mid-30’s that shark week can make me more emotionally vulnerable. I had an online gaming date tonight with my partner and I knew I was going to be a bit … off. I *should* have communicated it to them prior but I didn’t really think it was going to be an issue 🤦‍♀️

We did our normal greetings and he asked how I was doing, and I asked if he wanted the easy answer or the longer one. He said the longer one and I explained that I was having a rough time due to hormones and really just wanted a hug/to be loved on. I reiterated that I knew he’s been busy, it wasn’t an ask for big emotional labor, nor was I asking him to make extra space for me since we’re having coffee on Thursday. Just wanted to explain where I was at for the evening. He thanked me for sharing, said that while he couldn’t exactly relate he understands that I’m human and it’s all good. This is paraphrased, he did a great job of listening/being empathetic. 

It should be noted that part of these hormonal swings make me teary. Like, y’all, I cry during commercials at this point 😂 

We spent roughly 10 minutes talking about this before diving into the game. Light chatter throughout, talking about our upcoming plans, etc. We’re preparing to log off and typically we kinda debrief over the game/previous convo threads/etc. So, I apologized for taking up part of our time initially with it all and he stated that it he would take time to “process it” and something about that statement just kind of … set of my waterworks. I also know that there’s nothing inherently wrong with that statement, so I said for him to take that time and I would talk with him when he had processed. Obviously still in tears but it’s midnight and we both have work in the morning and my hormonal crying is on me 😅

He assured me that we’d talk soon, that we’ll be fine, and that he loved me before we hung up for the night. 

I guess I just needed to get this all out into the void! The tears lasted for like, 2 minutes after the hang-up and I’m just kinda feeling … embarrassed? 😳 Like, I know we’re all human but I’m usually someone who’s quite good at managing my emotions/compartmentalizing and I always feel this little bit of shame when I don’t quite hit my own normal standard. I feel like I made him act as emotional support without his informed consent and that bothers me 😕

Has anyone else noticed a shift in how their period alters their ability to emotionally regulate? I’d like to ensure this doesn’t happen again and I think part of that is just going to be upfront communication of when the time of the month starts, how I’m feeling, and if we have a date scheduled to kind of assess myself internally before pressing on with it or maybe needing a reschedule? 

For reference, we’ve been together for about 10 months and this is the first time something like this has happened 😕

It’s not housekeeping. It’s not food delivery. It’s not a random drunk looking for their coworker, wife or both.   
   
It’s Ian. He’s rocking the techie manager look: jeans, dress shoes, dress shirt and suit jacket. He’s strangely not giving off the bizarre vibes he used to. 
  
Ian:”We’ve got to get cracking if we want to hit your window. We’ve got to spin up a new store. Let’s do it feature by feature, test & scan, then pick the next feature. Then we do a final test when it’s all together.   
  
me, wondering if Ian being reasonable is some new fad:”Yeah. I agree. Let’s start with front end- product copy and pictures.  
  
I’m surprised that Ian and I are actually doing this. A dry erase marker and the hotel room mirror make for a scrum board. Some midgrade hotel coffee sees us through to around 5:30 and what seems to be a working store with a day to spare. I’ve started an automated scan which will take about half an hour to run.   
  
I’m hungrier than I am tired. I think I’ve got a good 30 minutes before I want to sleep for a bit.   
  
I look at my calendar. First call is 11am. I’ve got enough time for a proper sit down breakfast, sleep for a few hours. That’s better than sleeping, eating something in a plastic wrapper and being miserable for the day.   
  
me:”Ian, there’s a Denny’s like three lights down. As much as I’d like to sample local diner fare…”  
  
Ian:”Understood. It’s no Waffle House or Walker Brothers, but it’ll do.”  
  
Denny’s provides a solid 8 out of 10 , and it’s exactly everything I needed. Ian and I have had a pleasant conversation. To prevent ruining the good vibes, I don’t bring any of our past difficulties.  
  
I remark on that in the parking lot.   
  
me:”Hey, I just want to say this has actually been pleasant, compared to previous times.”  
  
Ian looks at me funny.   
  
Ian:”Well, you were starting to screw it up, so I got involved. Don’t you remember how this works?”  
  
me:”What?”  
  
I hear someone yelling Ian’s name from inside the restaurant.   
  
A waitress waves at me, holding a credit card.   
  
Waitress:”Ian? I have your credit card.”  
  
She walks over and gives it to me. I try to refuse, pointing behind me.   
  
Ian’s not there. She presses the card into my hand and walks back into the restaurant. I walk back to the rental car and wait for a few minutes. No Ian. I don’t see him anywhere on the premises. I’m starting to feel the claws of sleep, so I drive back to the hotel before texting Ian about his card.

Hi everyone!

I’ve been interning and receiving training as a social media manager for the past year and a half. While I don’t consider myself a “manager” yet due to limited experience, I prefer calling myself an SMM specialist. I’ve worked with clients growing TikTok, Instagram, and LinkedIn accounts, but sadly, I’ve neglected my own socials – which is my main focus now!

I’ve recently transitioned to freelancing and named my brand “Mattcoffe” (inspired by matcha and coffee, which I love, and seems to be everyone’s favorite drink!). I offer virtual assistant, bookkeeping, and social media marketing services. My target audience is small business owners who are too busy to manage their social media, admin work, and finances.

I’ve had a few potential clients, but after discovery calls, they’ve lost interest, and I’m not sure where I’m going wrong.

A few questions for you all:

1.	Any solid advice on growing organically on Instagram, LinkedIn, and Facebook groups to get clients?
	
2.	Tips for improving my discovery calls to increase conversions?
	
3.	Do you recommend niching down as a beginner? If so, which niche do you suggest?
	
4.	Is my matcha and coffee theme a dumb idea? I plan to do carousel designs based on that theme, but I’m unsure if it fits the professional SMM space.

I know it sounds awful, and I am deeply ashamed of my actions to this day. I am not making any excuses or trying to rationalize what I did. All my partners before and after were my age or older, so this is not something I am ""chasing after"". He was the one and only exception that haunts me till this day...

When I met Z, he was a regular at the coffee shop where I worked as a barista. He was sweet, charismatic, cute, and a little nerdy. He also seemed incredibly mature for his age. I was shocked to find out his age when he told me, and because of that I decided to not pursue this crush. But he was hard to avoid as he would often visit the shop and walk me home after work (we lived in the same direction). Eventually, we started opening up to each other and realized we had a lot in common. Both of us had difficult childhoods and had to grow up quickly. This made him seem even more mature and eventually, I started rationalizing our relationship as being okay, and he noticed that shift. So, we started going out.

Some of my friends were against the relationship, others advised me to keep it under wraps until Z turned 18. In retrospect, I really should have listened to the advice of my friends. However, I can't change the past. We ended up dating for two years before breaking up, and while we don't talk much anymore, we still greet each other on the street while passing by. My current partner knows this, he keeps telling me that while not morally correct, he was only a couple months away from being an adult and not to beat myself up about it. Yet it still bothers me...

Although I have moved on from this relationship, I can't shake the guilt and shame I feel. I'm constantly anxious that someone will find out about my past and judge me for it. My anxiety is now doubled by the fact that my influencer status is growing rapidly, making me feel even more exposed and vulnerable. I'm in the creative field and don't show my identity much but this still frightens me. I don't know how to move forward or how to forgive myself for what I did.

Hello everyone,

I’m looking for some guidance on arranging a coffee table in my living room. I currently have the IKEA SÖDERHAMN sofa paired with the matching ottoman. However, I’m finding it challenging to incorporate a coffee table into the setup. I’ve experimented with various shapes—rectangle, circle, and square—but none seem to fit quite right.

The main issue is that the ottoman occupies the space where a coffee table would typically go, leaving little room for leg movement. I’m considering repositioning the ottoman to accommodate a coffee table but am unsure of the best approach.

Has anyone else faced this dilemma or have suggestions on how to effectively integrate both pieces? Your insights and recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

It’s like a virtual *jeepney* ride—slow, crowded, and occasionally someone’s shouting about something nobody asked for. The subreddit is so quiet, you’d think it’s a library during *siesta* time. And when someone does post, it’s either “Where’s the best durian?” (spoiler: it’s everywhere) or “Is it safe to visit Davao?” (yes, but the real danger is dying of boredom scrolling through the sub). It’s the digital equivalent of a *tambay* session at a *sari-sari store*—everyone’s just there, but nobody’s really doing anything. Keep it spicy, r/davao, or at least as spicy as a *sinuglaw* without the chili.

Alright, let’s fire up the grill and roast r/davao with some *sinugba*\-level heat. Here are seven things to roast about the subreddit:

1. **The Eternal Durian Debate** Every other post is about durian—where to buy it, how to eat it, or why it smells like a crime scene. We get it, Davao is the durian capital, but can we talk about something else? Maybe the *marang* deserves some love too.
2. **“Is Davao Safe?” Posts** It’s like clockwork. Someone asks if Davao is safe, and the comments section turns into a mix of “yes, it’s the safest city” and “just don’t badmouth the D\_\_\_\_\_s."" Spoiler: It’s safe, but the real danger is stepping on a durian shell. (*OP's note: name blanked out for obvious reasons.)*
3. **The Subreddit is Sleepier Than a Siesta** The activity level is so low, you’d think the entire subreddit is on *pahulay* mode. It’s like a ghost town, except the ghosts are too busy eating *balut* to post.
4. **Overflowing with Tourist Questions** “Where’s the best *lechon*?” “What’s the weather like?” “Can I wear shorts?” It’s like Google doesn’t exist for these people. At this point, the subreddit should just pin a FAQ and call it a day.
5. **The Occasional Overly Serious Political Post** Someone drops a political hot take, and suddenly the comments section turns into a battlefield. It’s like watching a teleserye where everyone’s arguing, but the plot hasn’t moved in 10 episodes.
6. **The Lack of Memes** For a city with such a vibrant culture, the meme game on r/davao is weaker than *barako* coffee diluted with 10 cups of water. Where’s the humor, people? Even *Manilenos* roast better.
7. **The Overused “Davao is the Best City” Trope** Yes, Davao is great, but the subreddit acts like it’s the only city in the Philippines that matters. Newsflash: Cebu has better *lechon*, Manila has better traffic (just kidding), and Baguio has better weather. Let’s tone down the *Davao superiority complex* a notch.

There you go—seven roasts hotter than a Davao afternoon. But hey, r/davao, we still love you. You’re like that one *tito* who tells the same stories over and over—annoying, but endearing. Keep it real!",9,1741151590.0,davao,3,0.8,False

I (24F) have friends from high school and college. But sometimes, I feel like they do not understand me or my interests at all. I grew up as a part of the nerdy, music department crowd in high school. Though I was never an outcast, I was never part of the main in group. It's always been like that for me, and though it made me insecure from time to time growing up, I am also okay with that. 

One of my closest friends from college is very different from me. She was very popular in high school. We had different experiences growing up, but I still feel very close to her regardless. Our differences are still noticeable today in our interests, style of dress, taste in music, even our career choices. She played soccer in high school, she was on student council, she's in finance now. I was in the music department, I had an emo phase, and now I'm in STEM. I think it's really cool that we can be friends and share our different things. My friend has told me that she does admire the risks I take with clothing and how I'm not afraid to try new things. I like that she shows me new perspectives about the world, and how I shouldn't feel bad about taking care of myself. However, sometimes she talks about me in ways that makes me feel kinda like a fraud? Idk if that's the best word. 

For example, she will poke fun at me and say that I do things only because I love to be different (i.e. I like to experiment with clothes, I like to listen to different styles of music and analyze what's happening in the songs, I like going to art museums, etc.) She sometimes calls me a microtrend final boss, even though I don't really resonate with that at all. (For those not chronically online, it is a jab at gen z ppl who wear fast fashion trends all the time and up charge random thrifted items on Depop for a crazy amount). I know that this is all in fun, but it makes me wonder if she really thinks that I do these things just because I'm a pick me or pretentious instead of just staying true to my beliefs or interests. Sometimes, my friends from high school will bring up things I did when we were younger and make fun of me for pretending to like coffee or something random (even though I never did pretend; I just went through a phase of liking certain foods like everyone else). My friends from college will laugh and call me embarrassing, and say that she could totally see me doing that. Situations like this add up and it makes me feel very confused and conflicted. I know that it's all in good fun and they aren't really trying to be mean, but it does come to a point where I feel like I'm being seen as inauthentic or fake by my friends, and I value their opinion. I want them to see me for myself and to take what I say as my truth, not an act to be perceived as an annoying poser.

Welcome to the unofficial “Washington 'Coffee' Party” – an emergent Call to Action inspired by the 50501 movement, a budding radical social worker with a big dream and some incredible friends, are proposing we take this threat of fascism and dismantle it piece by piece because there is nobody “loud enough” stepping up.

TLDR: The Federal Government has:

·       left ***us*** super, super unprotected;

·       disliked by ***our*** allies for turning “our” backs on them and ***our*** promises

·       started hooking up with ***our*** enemies and;

·       said things for show to win the election and continue to bend the truth to the American people’s faces

We are really sick and tired of the *unbelievable* bullshit and it’s only been *four weeks.*.

In the same spirit to hopefully kick off a peaceful, modern-day 'revolution' of the American People, we would like to propose the following Call to Action:

Petition Governor Ferguson to order ALL Washington State Government officials – **specifically including local law enforcement and federal military reserve troops** – to protect the Washingtonian working class’ participation in a ***Federal Tax Strike*** by allowing Washington citizens to redirect federally paid tax dollars to Washington State instead. This strike is in response to Benedict Trump’s indefinite hold on federal funds for anyone (individual, organization, and/or state) who does not align with his fascist administration’s policies.

Boy do I have a doozy!

Last week I had a delivery of 100 little ducks. You know the kind people leave around their friends houses when they are on holiday. My work is going through a tumultuous time and I thought it might boost morale or at least give a reprieve from the negativity for 5 mins.

So I dotted these ducks around for people to find and it went down a treat! With people even rehiding the ducks for other coworkers the next day. People were laughing and talking about it for a couple of days. Even the directors found a couple, they were a bit bemused but left us to it.

One of the directors made a comment that without his glasses he assumed they were sweets that had been left out. He was glad he took a closer look before trying some!

My problem colleague overheard this and then made the comment that I was grooming both children and men with the ducks.

Office fun = me being a child groomer.

Reported to HR but I think I'm ready to move on to a different company now.

*\[later that afternoon\]*

UPDATE: Had a meeting with my manager this afternoon and will be raising a formal grievance against the problem coworker.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: I'm desperately trying to figure what dots they thought they were connecting to make that conclusion. There's gotta be more than they're convinced is related to this. Ducks equal grooming? The confusion is strong

>**OOP:** After everyone went silent following her comment. She was trying to explain that it was like I was luring children with sweets but with ducks... Even though our office is 18+.  
Not entirely sure how she jumped to that but as said she's the problem colleague. She's not happy unless she's insulted someone.  
*OOP adds:*  
Later that afternoon after I had brought it up to my manager, she tried saying it was the kind of joke she would make with her husband on the sofa... Had to say that I'm not her husband, I'm not even her friend, I am her work colleague in a professional setting... How often do they joke about that sort of stuff for it to feel so normal for her?!

Commenter: Put an obscenely large number of ducks on just that person's desk.

>**OOP:** I didn't hide all 100! Still have a few left. Might have to do that next time in the office

Commenter: Sounds like the problem co-worker is trying to start a situation to get rid of you. Be careful.

>**OOP:** Thanks I've reported her for other things in the past. For comments like ""your so fat you should be dead"" etc. so I have a trail with HR already.

Commenter: That bitch! Omg. You’re calmer than I am. I’m pretty sure I would say something awful as a knee jerk response, before I could remind myself that I’m at work.

>**OOP:** They are usually in the middle of other conversations so I'm usually left reeling a bit and then she gets up and flounces away 9/10 straight after

*To another commenter asking how she hasn't been fired:*

>I think the problem is no one reports it. She makes nasty comments to everyone but I think every one feels the same that it's just one comment what will reporting it even do. She's also not silly. She has only slipped up and insulted me in front of others a handful of times. Two years worth of insults mostly when we were alone together.  
Our reception team pulled me aside to ask some questions a few weeks ago. I answered them and asked why they didn't ask the problem coworker as it's actually her area not mine. They felt she would give them grief for not knowing. I told my manager what they had said to me and she went down to talk to them about it but they didn't mention problem coworker and instead say they grabbed me because they saw me.  
Amazing one person can create such a fear culture about themselves

Commenter: Do not leave over this idiot. Your workplace needs you and your ducky joy over them. I think you should pursue some sort of defamation case against them. They have no right to put this on your name with no proof to it.

>**OOP:** Thanks I appreciate that! I try and make work a bit more fun, if I've gotta spend 8 hours with these people I'm gunna want them to be happy haha.  
I have a meeting with HR tomorrow so will see where they are willing to go with this first.

Ok, since it’s been definitively decided that your coworker is mean and crazy, can we talk about the ducks please? I’ve never heard of this before and am intrigued. Also, what do jeeps have to do with it?

>**OOP:** Jeep owner leaves little rubber ducks on other jeep owners cars, there's an FB group on it! It's a cute little community thing  
The hiding ducks was a trend on tiktok a couple of years ago , the ducks are tiny under a centimeter big. You are meant to hide them both in plain sight and in silly places. One duck made it's way into one directors office and his empty coffee mug.

*\[editor's note- can confirm, I've had a few contracts with an opera company where someone hid a bunch of tiny ducks in random places. It definitely brought a smile to my face to find them!\]*

Commenter: Are you a gay man? Trying to figure out if they’re applying some kind of homophobic interpretation to your actions. You know…. With you trying to groom all the men and children…..

>**OOP:** Lol no I'm a straight female. However she is transphobic and homophobic. She doesn't make outward comments but one of my brothers is gay and the other is trans. Whenever I mentioned them she is unhappy

Commenter: Every accusation is a confession, they say \[...\]

>**OOP:** Yes it does feel that way. Most times she's insulted me it's because she's insecure of something and will take it out on me.  
E.g. her Dr told her to lose weight. That was the day she told me I was so fat I should be dead.  
She was told she has high cholesterol so she took my tea out of my hands and wouldn't allow me to put sugar in because I was killing myself.  
She was reprimanded at work for wearing flip flops and vest tops to the office. so she insulted my clothes.  
The list goes on and on  
Not sure how child grooming fits into it though.

**Mini update in Comments: February 7, 2025**

I spoke to the director yesterday and he was a sweetheart and made me feel a lot better about the whole situation. I think i am going to continue with a grievance and at least then in the future her nastiness will be taken as evidence.

He did say while vile he doesn't think its a sackable offence yet but did also say the only thing he was aware of at the time of the conversation was that she had called me a child groomer. None of the history. So it will still be investigated full if i raise the grievance.

Brought up conflicting feelings as i don't want it to escalate/ her to lose her job, i just don't want to be insulted in the workplace.

*Comments:*

Commenter: Well, at least you’ve got lots of witnesses. If she’s truly disliked in your workplace as the ‘problem colleague’ then they’ll back you up

>**OOP:** Yes I spoke to one of the ladies today, the grievance form makes you state the witnesses and I wanted to make sure they were comfortable with me putting them down and she was lovely and said she'd support in any way she could.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1iyn848/update_coworker_claims_that_i_groom_children/)**: February 26, 2025 (3 weeks later)**

So it has been three weeks since my co-worker called me a child groomer and my manager called us into a meeting where I called out her poor behaviour over the past two years. Since then I have not heard or spoken to my co-worker. She ignores any work related message and is refusing to come into the office. She is working from home although I can't see that much work is being done.

She has recently asked a department that I have been working closely with if she can join them in their office if she has to come into work.

HR have asked us if we would both be willing to attend mediation. I said yes. I am not sure what my co-workers response was but since it was due to start this week and has not, i assume she refused to it.

I was going to raise a grievance over this but I was invited to a job interview at a company I had previously applied for and was offered the job. Contract signed and notice handed in!

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Oooooo!!!! If they ask are you going to mention that how they botched this incident inspired you to see what else was available?

Congratulations!

>**OOP:** Oh of course, my work do exit interviews so it will all be being brought up!

*OOP adds a bit more context to the story:*

>I hid little ducks around the office. She joined in. Had a great time. Two days later called me a child groomer. I got upset as I was groomed as a child. Which anyone could work out considering how old I was when I had my first child. (She has my DOB on our central system and our children are the same age).  
I went to my manager upset. She called us into a meeting together. Co-worker walked in and immediately mocked me for being upset because she was only joking. I got even more upset and called her out on her behaviour (There isnt a week this woman doesn't insult or belittle me in some way).  
When asked WTF she thought was similar to child grooming she said it was like I luring children with sweets but with the ducks in a 18+ office.  
*OOP follows up with another comment:*  
Just to add, while I am the most frequently insulted/belittled by her, she does do it to the other staff too. A colleague in another department has just told me she reached out to problem colleague asking for help with a task yesterday and got a very passive aggressive response back, her question was answered but she was made to feel stupid. She did read the email responses out loud to her bank of desks, the head of HR was sitting opposite her at the time.  
Lots of tuts but nothing else.

Commenter: I’m sure you know this, but your co-worker should have been fired on the spot. You can let them know in your exit interview that if this same co-worker continues to spread accusations about you in this workplace, they’ll be liable for allowing it to go on.

>**OOP:** She should have. The fact she didn't and multiple people also heard and reported it and still she didn't and still hasn't faced any repercussion and is instead breaking our hybrid working agreement etc.  
It was time to leave. The new job is a step up with better pay and better hours so at least I have that going for me.

Commenter: I'm constantly amazed at companies like this. I'm over here wondering will I be laid off if I don't adhere to the ever changing rules...and there are companies that bend over backwards to accommodate a poorly performing person who then just refuses to come in.

>**OOP:** There seems to be one rule for the problem people and one rule for the rest of us. I don't think I would get away with insulting people like that, especially to superiors!

*On a happier note regarding ducks:*

>Its such a small but fun thing to do! I know it wouldn't work in most offices but for the people I had planned it for it went down a treat!  
It is a work friends big birthday in a couple of weeks. She missed out on the ducks and was disappointed about it so we are planning a little scavanger hunt through our local high street for her (Shes a well known resident) and ending it at her fave restaurant. I'm planning on little envelopes with clues and a little duck in each envelope too

1j3vg95,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1j3vg95/is_it_time_to_separate_from_my_wife/,Is it time to separate from my wife?,"Hi all. Need advice. I've reached a point in my marriage where I am just exhausted from years of emotional struggles. Me (41M) and her (46F) have been married almost 8 years, and I can only think of a few months early in her pregnancy where things were calm and fun and great. She agrees. 

The short short version: we got married, moved to her home country 2 months later, tried to have a baby. Struggled with infertility. She had 2 ectopic pregnancies from IVF in 3 months, which led to her having an emotional breakdown (#1) which required her to visit a mental health clinic for a time. We got through it.

Then she got pregnant naturally, had the baby. Already during early pregnancy our intimacy started declining, because she just wasn't interested. I put it down to hormones and worked with her and didn't make a big deal out of it. Then the baby arrived, my wife just threw herself 100% into being a mom, and I started feeling neglected. Our intimacy was low, sex life also basically zero. Our kid was co-sleeping with her while she breastfed so I slept in a different bed for the next year almost. I started resenting her.

I'll mention my wife is a SAHM, which is what we both wanted. 

Due to lack of sleep when my daughter was around 6 months old, my wife spiraled again into a mental health crisis (#2) where we needed to fly my mom out to help us look after our baby so I could keep working and my wife could rest. Resentment grows. 

I posted about 6 months regarding the struggles we were having around not agreeing on [having a second child.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1f8tjlt/wife_wants_a_second_child_desperately_i_dont_2/) That was mental health crisis (#3). My wife is still struggling to accept that reality. She resents me deeply for not giving her a second child. I resent her more for how for over 2 years she couldn't take ""no"" for an answer, and how she couldn't see my POV as valid. She thought I was just wrong and needed to be convinced. 

We went on a family vacation recently and she again couldn't sleep and when we came back she again visited the clinic (#4). 

We keep having these awful deep conversations where she recognizes what she puts me through, she recognizes that I don't get the attention, affection, and love I deserve, and she wants to do better. She wants to stay married. I'm just so tired of this situation. I fantasize about just being by myself (when I'm not with my daughter of course) and not having to have these conversations. I'd rather be by myself than like this. 

We went on a date yesterday. We went for coffee and to a movie. It was painfully awkward because of the undercurrent of everything we are dealing with and constantly talking about and mulling over. She told me that if I want to leave, she would completely understand it, even though she doesn't want me to.

We have a 3.5 year old. I am afraid of what separating will do to her, even though I'm perfectly aware that my wife and I are not modeling the kind of healthy relationship she needs to see. I take extremely seriously the advice I got in that thread I linked that our home is already broken. 

I feel like I've failed. So much therapy (individual and couples), so many books read, so many podcasts listened to, so many deep heart-to-heart conversations. It wasn't (or hasn't been) enough. I don't want to fail my daughter. I worry that I am just going to make a selfish decision that I will regret that will hurt her in the long run. But at this point, I just don't feel like I want to try any longer.

Is there anything left for me to do?",3,1741150811.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

Recently on the the person who I have guided, broke no contact of 5 months within few days of practice of the law - Law of Assumption. 


On the onset, the person had deep deep believe in Tarot cards, believing them to be true having power over the life. On the very first meet I saw this thing. And explicitly asked to relieve the fact that tarots dies not hold any power over life, not at all, nothing whatsoever. And having decided that, the routine agreed upon for the same was : 

1. Every night - Creating imaginal act and feeling as if it's true and sleep on it, not typical SATS, no trance, just ""what would it feel like if it's true?""

2. In day time carving out few minutes to feel as if it's true while having 5-10 mins of break having coffee or similar

Thats all I asked of the person to do. 

May I say, I'm impressed by the intensity of the person, the person fully believed the discussion we have and executed what we have discussed to do.

1j3ve27,https://www.reddit.com/r/redeemedzoomer/comments/1j3ve27/help_me_choose_a_church_for_me_and_my_family/,Help me choose a church for me and my family,"Okay so here are the considerations:

I (39m) grew up Methodist. I am quite liberal and interact very poorly with Trumpies, who I would prefer to avoid.
I had some bad experiences with a rural Pentecostal congregation a long time ago, with weird shit and the preacher being a charismatic sex pervert, and I think they’re nuts. I felt like the Pentecostal yabbering was ridiculous also, and prefer a middle-to-high church type of experience, with some sense of order and tradition. I would like some architecture. Wooden walls and stained glass would be nice, and perhaps a built-in pipe organ? I feel like I’ve been most comfortable in Methodist UMC congregations, historically.
(The sort of place where I would want to wear slacks and a tie, as opposed to cargo shorts)

I don’t want to see any kind of American flag in a sanctuary, as Christ is for all nations. And we don’t need to be going to Haiti to take photos with the poor kids, as we can interface with the poor and the sick right here at home. Evangelism is selfish, and it sucks. I feel like American Christianity has a sickness that contributes to the rise of evil in this world, and I disconnected a long time ago. 

I don’t love a heavy focus on end times Armageddon stuff, and I don’t believe in the rapture or any of that Israel fetish stuff. I would like to see a Christlike emphasis on social justice instead of extrapolating nonsense from ancient acid trips. I do not consider scripture to be perfect or flawless, as it contains contradictions and was written and curated by humans, but I do believe that the people who recorded the events of the gospels witness a divine event. 

At the same time, were I to go back to church, I find excessively progressive churches to be, frankly, annoying. Annoying is better than dangerous and evil, I suppose, but I still don’t want to go to a church that is super overtly gay. 

I’m a bit of a hater, and I’m comfortable with that about myself. (If you’re going to tsk-tsk me for disrespecting MAGA filth, spare us both the confrontation and keep scrolling.)

If it were just me, I’d never go back. 

But my wife, she yearns for church and wants it to be a part of her life. And that’s important to me.

She is black, and I am white. The churches of her youth were black, but the churches of my youth were in a rural area that didn’t have black people. We live together in a big big city.

Now she (36f) grew up Pentecostal and doesn’t enjoy it when I make jokes about the yabbering. She believes in stuff like the rapture, and isn’t interested in hearing about how it was invented in the 1800s and popularized by biblical fanfics. She also goes to non-denomination megachurches, which feel off-putting and scammy to me.
(Lord, spare me from a church with bass guitars and a drum set. And a coffee shop? In a church? Really? I vastly prefer to have shitty coffee in the basement after service out of a huge carafe, thx)

She wants a church that has music and a high sense of spirit, and cultivates a personal relationship with the Lord, which contrasts a bit with my desire for a sense of tradition. 

I don’t know really how to find somewhere that we can both feel at home. How do we even approach this problem? We are so different lol",0,1741150594.0,redeemedzoomer,5,0.5,False

I love music and when I say that I actually mean it. I listen to a wide range of music from as early as 1800s to today's music.

When I'm not listening to music then I am most likely writing (sometimes while listening to music...), cooking, focusing on my diet or out walking. I love visiting cafés and learning about other cultures. On top of that I enjoy sport, tech, gaming, Pharmacology, and much more. You'll have to message me to find out.

I loved her so much, first relationship I genuinely felt happy and free to be my whole self. I’d consider it lucky to get another chance at that again with someone so beautiful. 2 years down the drain after our first argument which I should’ve known was the first sign. 

I could feel something was off for the past 3 weeks, she was colder, avoidant and abrupt with her conversation. So as any perfect guy would do, I decided to play along rather than delve into what was wrong with us with an actual deep conversation. 

It’s her birthday so I tell her happy bday, all be it the last one to tell her in the house (mistake) and we go to grab coffee. We’re both quiet and avoidant on the car ride so she asks me if I’m okay and I say yes. Then I ask her and she says she’s not, she actually hasn’t been since January. So that’s where the argument starts. 

We go on a walk to talk about what’s going on, she asks me why I’m acting the way I am. I say I feel like she doesn’t seem the like me rn. She asks why do I think that. I say it’s probably me focusing on finishing school and not working, too pushy for sex, and I forgot the third reason in all honesty. She says the not working is part of it but not the main reason. Said the relationship and conversation we’ve been having has been to surface level, and I’ve been failing to ask what’s really been going on with her everyday life. How she’s feeling emotionally, how she’s been feeling about us, failing to ask more about the stuff she’s been doing. Which she’s right about, at the most I was asking what was wrong and nothing past that when she gave her usual answer. I was just so accustomed to her depression I hadn’t noticed a difference.

Then she said she texted her ex back in January just to check up on a situation he and my ex’s sisters ex had been through, nothing more tho. But she said it did open up the gates for her thinking tho. We had gotten together 2 months after she had gotten out of a 4 year relationship with she said “the love of her life” and she didn’t understand why he didn’t want her. I had gotten out of a 4 year relationship too 5 months prior but felt like I had recovered, especially after meeting my now ex. She said she never gave herself the time to recover and just started talking to me to probably mask her feelings. Our relationship burned to bright and fast and now she said she was feeling the repercussions of that. She had just become accustomed to always being with someone. 

It was a feeling I allowed her to struggle with for a few months without noticing and addressing. And it had boiled over to the point where she thought it was best to be apart. She said I’m sorry to be cliche but “it’s not you, it’s me”. I hadn’t really said much up to that point just due to the fact I was in a good place mentally, I mentioned I did feel a bit robotic and mundane more than usual and I know I was being boring but it’s become kind of normal to me atp. I truly loved her, and that hadn’t changed since the day I felt those feelings. So I had no resentment towards her. I hadn’t nothing more to say then I was sorry for hurting her and failing to see what she was going through mentally.

We ended up walking back to her sisters house quietly, grabbed my stuff, hugged and left. My heart was pounding tho and the thought of losing her kept swirling in my brain and thought maybe she wanted me to fight more for her. So I drove back and asked if we could talk a little more. I basically said I loved her more than anything and nothing hurts me more to know that I failed her and left her in pain. I really do wanna fight for this relationship and I’ll actively improve my communication skills and want to be in her corner when she’s at her lowest. I know it does sound way too cliche tho. She said she loves me and really doesn’t hate me in any way. She said don’t think of yourself as boring or that you bring out the worst in people because it’s not true. She just really needed to realize that she doesn’t have to be with someone. And I can’t lie that part left me with the most questions but left it at there. I said sorry for ruining your bday in a joking matter and we hugged it out before we parted ways. She said I can reach out if I needed anything.

Of course I cried that whole day and a little the next but Monday rolled around and the feeling in my chest went away. We were still following each other on social media with our pictures up and sharing locations but not talking. So of course I was stalking anything I could. Then I had a convo with my best friend about the whole situation and said that I should probably just cut everything off for my own sake and he made some really good points that resonated with me and decided to go through with it. It hurt but I knew for my own sake to move past it, I had to rip the band-aid off. I know she’s not going to come back as much as I want her too. 

Now it’s Tuesday and I’m feeling a bit better. Been working out, applied to some jobs and keeping myself occupied as much as I can, but I still have her number and am just waiting for any kind of text from her. And I know the pain is just getting started, but I just don’t wanna let myself or her down. It just hurts the most knowing I’m still going to love her and reminisce for a very long time.

Sorry for the long exposition, just felt like I needed to type this out somewhere, appreciate if you read it all the way through and feel free to share any advice to me.

When I have my morning coffee ,I hear you whisper and talk,

While I take a shower, I vow not to think of you,
By the time I drive to work, I am back to missing you.

This is my routine -I grieve and keep you alive.
I try to step out of my head, but mostly am cooped up inside.

I like it where I am , I have you for company,
I may fight and hate, but then forgive and go back to loving you intensely.

The world reminds me of your absence,
The longing comes and goes like the moon's cycle,
I live this life where I talk ,work,smile, and be present,
Each day, I keep dying a little inside.

I want to manifest the day when you will be a faint memory , 
I remember you with a smile and sigh away fondly.

What will it take to reach there? I ask myself, 
Distraction, self-restraint, and strength replies my higher self.

But once and a while I like some past 8pm(don't even ask about my sleep schedule), so I perfectly understand it may not be a proper double batch or whatever at the end of the day, having worked a cafe myself. 

But sometimes it's so light, I once thought they were actually cleaning out the machine and I may have got some cleaning agent. But I still get some coffee taste, so I think they just might use too much ice with too little left over coffee maybe? Added an image of my current coffee and you can see how light it is with a little bit of half and half lol. 

TLDR- it's not really a complaint, because as a previous cafe worker I totally understand that I'm the jerk asking for iced coffee at the end of the day and am willing to drink whatever really(especially for free) I just want to know if anyone who works there can tell me if they've ever cleaned the machine early, or if it's simply that the batches vary in quality due to it being end of the day.

1j3v5zn,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1j3v5zn/i_figured_out_what_was_hampering_my_weight_loss/,I figured out what was hampering my weight loss: caffeine,"TLDR: the diuretic effects of caffeine are stronger after your mid-40s and no matter how much water I drank I was still getting brain fog which was making it harder to lose weight. That's my theory anyway.

I gained about 8 lb last year and I was unhappy about that. Usually I have pretty good control over my weight. But I was dealing with these constant episodes of brain fog and I couldn't make any sense of it. Talked to several doctors about it and they didn't really have any good ideas. They just told me that it was aging or due to inflammation from getting my frontal lobe irradiated during radiation treatment for cancer 10 years ago. One doctor suggested more cardio and that was helpful but that wasn't the real issue. I tried changing up my vitamins too that didn't help.

To try and deal with the brain fog I was drinking a bunch of water, but it just made me go to the bathroom more. Adding salt and electrolytes did help but they didn't fix it, it didn't go away. More salt made my blood pressure drop, I almost fell one time because of it. It got to the point that some of the time I didn't feel comfortable driving because I felt kind of dopey. 

Why was this hampering my weight loss? Because it was really hard to restrict calories and deal with this brain fog at the same time. Because I thought well I need carbs because I have this brain fog and the carbs did seem to help that. But too many carbs made it hard to lose weight. 

On a typical day I was consuming about 2 cups of coffee spread over three cups. Half caff for two of the cups. 

So I dropped my caffeine intake from 160 mg to 120 mg daily. And suddenly the brain fog went away. Which made it easier to restrict my carbohydrates, which made it easier to lose weight. So I'm down about 3 lb right now. Which doesn't seem like much, but it's progress in the right direction and it hasn't been difficult.

So sadly I have to leave that low caffeine life now. Which sucks because I love coffee. And decaf isn't as good.",27,1741149811.0,loseit,3,0.7,False

1j3uysn,https://i.redd.it/cef62oc9usme1.jpeg,Experimenting with Noma Base Recipe,"So recently heard about the book on Fermentation by Noma - read the whole part on kombucha - they talk about 12 Bx sugar solution which I basically interpret as 12% sugar content in your kombucha at the start. I am also flavouring the kombucha from the 1F cause apparently it doesn’t make a difference? At least according to the book. I guess the only thing would be that the flavour will get carried onto other batches and I am planning to keep brewing the same flavour from the same SCOBY. Now that I think of it, its gonn be a disaster to organise different SCOBY houses but whats done is done. 

The reasoning why I have done the flavouring in 1F is cause I am trying to circumvent a few laws in my home country (I wanna launch my own brand and the taxation on sugary carbonated drinks is crazy here)

The end result would ideally be something punchy but not fizzy and kinda sweet since 120g of sugar per litre of water is just 📈

The flavours: Barbara Estate Chocolaty Coffee, Apple Cinnamon (slices and whole spice, no powder), Blend of Various Spices and Raw

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s to early 30s ideally please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone I want to hear from women that have good maturity. 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future.

I have been celibate by choice all my life. I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it.

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one.

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I have never had anything wrong with me that is serious medically I also rarely get unwell. 

I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. 

You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way. 

I love salmon my favourite fish and I love avocados they are so good for the skin. I love having nice burgers out and I also make my own from scratch smash burgers making your own is the best way at home. I love Italian food pasta and pizza the proper stuff being close to Italy we get a lot of the authentic Italian food here. 

I love Indian food too curries for me are probably my favourite food out of them all I don’t think you can beat this type of food when it’s done properly. Fish and chips proper English style would also be a favourite of mine. 

Burgers I love five guys and shake shack we had Both of these when I lived in the UK. In France we have five guys but I also love Burger King I love the flame grilled burgers 

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings either and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have an cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t have any heavy makeup fake tan fake nails fake eyelashes and fake hair and nails. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy.

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1j3uv7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/pmp/comments/1j3uv7r/passed_atatat_crammed_2_days_straight_into_exam/,Passed AT/AT/AT - Crammed 2 days straight into exam,"Relieved, grateful, blessed... the list goes on. But I want to make something clear for those who may be in the early stages of pursuing or studying for their PMP – If you are looking for a starting point, this group is it.

I downloaded Reddit specifically for this subreddit, and the realized value was immediate. I am posting for the first time ever on this platform because I know someone is out there just trying to get a footing, and I want to pay it forward.

*Disclaimer:* There are smarter, more experienced people than I who have written about their PMP experiences more comprehensively. I suggest exploring all you can. These are just my raw thoughts.

**Background**: 3.5-year PM. Former teacher with master's degree. Decent test taker. Decided to play the corporate game. Motivated to advance my career outside teaching and further legitimize my abilities and capabilities in other sectors. Will definitely return to teaching at some point.

**TLDR:**

* If I had to do it again, I would **look at other options outside of the PMI training course** for your hours.
* **Study Hall really helped me.** I would strongly recommend it.
   * Mock Exam 1: 70%
   * Mock Exam 2: 76% (83% w/o expert-level questions)
   * Mock Exam 3: 74% (82% w/o Expert questions).
* **Practice like you play**. Take two or more mock exams straight through to cement the mindset.
* **AR and DM have great** content on YouTube. Use them.
   * From what I can tell, a seldom-mentioned resource is **AR's audiobook.** Very Process and PM Mindset focused.
* **Don't overthink** the exam. With a little common sense and a solid base, **you can eliminate two answers from almost every question**. Study it a bit more, and the right answer practically jumps off the screen.

**Prep:**

* **Training Hours:** The PMI training course was the recommended course by my company’s PMO for the necessary hours. I assume that they were simply not aware that there are alternative, viable, and accredited options out there. There are. Put simply, this PMI training course felt like it did little to prepare me, in the long run.
   * **Note:** Know (or learn) how you best study, absorb info, and understand concepts. The PMI training course is self-paced but lacks interactivity and creativity of concepts, as well as adequate assessment opportunities, in my opinion. The most popular alternative based on this subreddit appears to be [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/pmp-certification-exam-prep-course-pmbok-6th-edition/?couponCode=ST10MT30325G2).

**Exam Application:**

* Actual priority PM work at my day job and personal priorities meant this took way too long. Like way too long. On top of that, I was obsessed with getting it **perfect**. My application was approved quickly, which meant it was worth it.
   * It is strongly advised that your relevant experience includes PM language. Explicitly weave in Process Group terms and categorizations, making sure you cover all Process Groups at least once across your included projects, if applicable.
   * I used AR’s simple structure (YouTube: [Writing PMP Exam Application Description](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-wuCxrJa8I&t=0s)). You might be like me, and the more you learn about PMs and the PMP, the more you realize these things you did that felt second nature were actually crucial steps in the process. Make those connections and emphasize them in the application.

**General Materials:**

* **PMI Study Hall (SH):** This is what worked for me. Two plan options that run on 3-month auto-renew cycles, SH Essentials and SH Plus.
   * I paid $79 for SH Plus and intended to complete my exam within the first 3 months. SH Plus comes with additional virtual flashcards and games that were a gentle introduction into studying terms and definitions to build a base, but I think I would’ve been okay with SH Essentials. I completed 3 out of 5 mock exams in SH Plus (Essentials only comes with 3 mock exams, FWIW).
   * I would revisit SH occasionally and eventually memorized a lot of the practice questions, as it allows for reassessment (hence my SH score on the practice questions at the bottom of the post). This is when I pivoted to the practice exams and mini-exams to establish a new baseline for understanding.
* **Audiobook: Andrew Ramdayal’s (AR) Scenario and knowledge-based Questions and Answers:**
   * For the Space Jame fans, this was ‘Michael’s Secret Stuff’ for me. With a free audible trial. I purchased this audiobook with domain-specific questions, answers, and rationalizations. My motivation to study came in waves. I could listen to this in the car, while running errands, or while traveling for work / on flights.
   * Eventually, the Process Groups chapters turn into Mock Exam questions, at which point I started tracking right and wrong responses and taking brief notes in a pad. Stopped after listening to 100 questions and got an 82%. This illuminated where I lacked: The differences between Agile principles and methodologies and their use cases, General PMP definitions, Procurement-related items, Monitor and Control Process Group.
* **Third Rock Notes:** Definitely check it out. I bought this stupidly affordable and comprehensive resource early on to build a base, but ultimately leaned on the interactive content and videos more.

**Cram and Exam:** Once I had a decent grasp on definitions, the flow of processes, and basic concepts, I set my exam date and proceeded to procrastinate. Everything following this transpired the two days leading up to the exam. I got a babysitter for the weekend and put my head down at my desk.

* **T-2 Days until Exam**
   * **YouTube: AR 200 Ultra Hard Questions (First 100 questions):** These questions, man... they humbled me. AR says in the intro that if you score 70% or above in this video, he’s confident you will pass the exam on the first try.
      * I paused the video at the beginning of every question to read and answer in silence. Then, fast-forwarded to the answer reveal, graded my response right or wrong, listened to the rationale, and captured 1-2 lines of notes. I would’ve rated the majority of my responses to the first 28 questions with high or moderate confidence. The reality was a score of 42%, 12/28 correct.
      * Occasionally, when I got some wrong, I also captured my immediate emotional reactions, including but not limited to: “FOCUS!” and “JUST READ THE QUESTION FOR WHAT IT IS. STOP MAKING ASSUMPTIONS.”
      * At one point, towards the end of that stretch of poor performance by me, AR actually says something like, “Now you may be frustrated at some of these answers – like they aren’t ‘correct enough.’ Your job here is not to find the exact answer, it’s to identify the best possible answer from the ones provided.” This is obvious to anyone who has ever taken a test, which is why I was/am legitimately embarrassed at how quickly my performance changed after hearing this. Just take every question as it is and do not trying to outsmart the test or yourself. I think this is a major component of what is commonly referred to as “the PM Mindset.”
      * After getting only 12 correct for the first 28, I finished the next 72 questions only getting 12 incorrect, 72/100 (72%) through the first 100. I had to do something with this momentum, so I got a coffee and some water and pivoted to SH mock exams.
   * **SH Mock Exam #2:** After catching a vibe on my 72% on the AR Ultra Hard questions, I immediately dove into the second SH mock exam and, for the first time, went start to finish on a real practice exam. (I finished mock exam #1 over a week about a month before this and scored 70%).
      * These mocks are 175 questions (Actual exam: 180) with a 4-hour clock (Actual exam: 3hr 50min). I decided not to pause this SH exam at any point and finished in 2hr 52min and heavily utilized the highlight feature for the first time.
      * **Score**: 76% (83% w/o expert-level questions). Starting to think this is working.
* **T-1 Day until Exam**
   * **YouTube: AR 200 Ultra Hard Questions (Last 100 questions):** One goal: Do not do worse on the last 100 than the first 100. Trust the mindset and what you have learned.
      * **Score**: 72% (again). Goal achieved! Didn’t get worse. We’re in a sweet spot.
   * **YouTube: David McLachlan: 200 Agile PMP Questions and Answers (First 15 questions):** I needed a break from AR. This was recommended everywhere in this subreddit. Watched as I cooked some food, and I learned about 30 Agile principles/practices in the first 15 questions. 
      * David does an unbelievable job communicating why an answer is right and where the red flags are. EX: ‘This answer is the best because of XYZ, and here are the wrong answers and **why** they are wrong in this context.’
      * He maximizes the learning potential in every question and draws little figures to help it stick. Seriously, these little 2-second doodles connected so many dots for me. If I didn’t cram, I would have allocated time to watch more of his videos. However, a third SH mock exam was the priority.
   * **SH Mock Exam #3:** Hit a little mental/physical wall from cramming for over a day straight. Occupational hazard as a procrastinator. Seeing that progress bar barely move after each question was tough, but I told myself that if I do well on this, I will ace it tomorrow, no questions asked.
      * **Score**: 74% (82% w/o Expert questions).
* **The PMP Exam:** I had terrible sleep every night leading up to this for 3^(rd) straight night, but I knew I was ready. After you check-in, the test is ready to begin at the click of a button.
   * **4 Drag and Drop**
      * Two on risk response strategies – match definition and term, match term and scenario.
      * Two match the technique to the scenario (mix of Agile and Waterfall terms)
   * **4 Graphs/Visuals**
      * Burndown chart – Identify the quadrant where the Spike occurred. – Didn’t spend enough time on Agile and could only vaguely recall this concept. But context tells you something is either going up or down and only two options fit that. 50/50 shot here and a Google search revealed I chose poorly)
      * SPI and CPI chart – Based on this chart, is the project behind/ahead of schedule, over/under budget? – Easy money
      * KanBan – There’s a bottleneck somewhere that is causing a delay that threatens the next release. Look at the KanBan and WIP lines and select the workstream that would benefit from more resources (aka. Where is the hold up?). – Never heard of WIP lines before the day before, but even if I had never heard of it, again, it was common sense.
   * **1 Formula**
      * No actual math had to be completed, but this question had some advanced-ish looking formulas. Question stated that the PM needed to calculate the value of the work completed thus far for an executive report. I was shown four screen shots of formulas and had to pick which would produce the desired calculation you were looking for. – At least know what the acronyms mean in formulas. That tipped it off a lot here. They aren’t trying to trick you.
   * **Breaks**
      * Skipped the first break because I had momentum / wanted it to be over. Took 3-4min in the second break to stretch in my chair, touch my toes, crack my back. Some people say absolutely, 100% take the breaks, and others say don’t fall for it and power through. Honestly, just do what feels right in that moment.
* **Immediate Reactions**
   * I was prepared, but this felt a little too much like AT/AT/AT. “There’s gotta be a catch. I overlooked something that is going to jeopardize the score.” Followed by incessant refreshing of my email and the PMI Dashboard. “Maybe they have a new system in place that tabulates the score automatically. No? Better check again in 10m to be sure.”
      * Got my scores **28 hours after I submitted my exam**. Finally took a breath.
   * My exam was easier than Study Hall and easier than AR's Ultra Hard questions.
      * I think the **mix** of these two was important. Complemented each other well.
   * I forget where I read/heard this, but the **PMI is not trying to trick you**. Sure, some questions are tricky, but at the end of the day, they are selling a product. They want you to succeed and flaunt that badge, attracting others. Just make sure you don’t go out of your way to trick yourself, getting bogged down in the number or complexity of the words on the screen.
   * If you study, apply common sense, and call on the PM mindset, you can eliminate AT LEAST two answers on the vast majority of questions, in my experience.
      * I flagged a lot of questions at the beginning of the exam, thinking there must be more to this I’m not seeing. Nope. Returned at the end of each section and would be able to confidently stick to or change my answer.
      * I kept flagging where appropriate, figuring that, as the exam goes on, a future question could inform a previous answer I was not 100% on. Happened once or twice where I was validated in my initial decision.
   * Pay attention to the question. Do you need to know what to do **first**? What to do **next**? Are you **solving/addressing** the problem? Are you ensuring the project is **successful**?
      * The most common scenario: If you are looking for what to do first in response to a new problem, you are assessing the problem/analyzing the impact. You are not solving.
   * **A whole lot of** “here is the problem, what should you do first, next, or to resolve?” And then the options essentially say: do nothing, do everything, tell the sponsor, and do the right thing.

I could have very easily gotten an exam with heavy Agile (where I studied the least), and who knows what my score would've been. A little luck of the draw, but the mindest is the mindset. Cement it into the grooves of your brain, and you should feel pretty confident you can pass.

Please try your best not to be hindered by a few mistakes or even a failed exam (I know, this is easier said than done). But just be the PM you already are. Assess, analyze, review, strategize, then take action and get your cert. You **got** this.

**One last thank you to everyone here**. Cannot believe how resourceful and supportive this group of strangers is to each other. People like me are reading your posts and taking them as gospel. Keep it up. Amen.

1j3uuts,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1j3uuts/my_mil_is_legally_insane_by_the_state/,My MIL is legally insane by the state,"Hello! I have t posted here before, but figured the community would appreciate this story. There is hope friends! I apologize that this is long. 

My MIL is legally crazy by our state. As in arrested and placed in mental care for her actions. Thankfully never against me or my husband. I’ll give you some early incidents in short before the main story. It gives background info about MIL. 

The very first time I ever met my MIL was when she backed into my car and blamed me for it. No… I was not in the car. And no… I did not park poorly. I was on the other side of the street and off to the side away from the driveway. MIL was mad that my husband (BF at the time) had not told her he was dating someone. 

MIL and I work at the same locations at times. She is a contract employee and I am technically her boss. This is how husband and I met was through this job actually. Which also made me my husband’s boss at times. However he is the lead of his team and I am the lead of mine. MIL threatened to report me for not having a conversation with her in regard to a lost and found item when I was at that time assisting with a high stress situation. Think 150 people angry in that high stress situation vs. a lost phone. I was doing my job as manager of the situation. Nothing came of it. 

My husband and I recently moved for his new job. We got married a few weeks ago because of this job and health insurance (US health insurance sucks). MIL was cordial at the supper and there were no problems. She had been trying in the past few months to change her attitude and wanted to build a relationship with me. I was not opposed and told my husband as such. He asked if she could come and check out the new place along with his grandparents (the folks who truly raised him). I said that was ok. She had never been to the previous place and had never met our cat.

I am very clear about boundaries and how I feel. I am not one to hid how I feel to him. However I do not pick fights or go out of my way to engage in arguments or hard conversations with his mother. 
When husband’s grandparents and MIL first arrived, outside of them being 45 minutes early from when we told them to be at the new place, everything was going fine. MIL liked the decorations. Everyone liked the apartment. MIL asked about some lighting I had put in our bedroom because she wanted to do something similar to her sunroom. I told her how to place the lights and how they worked. While husband and I are legally married, we have not had the full wedding and celebration. I mentioned the wedding and some of the plans. My mom and I are going to be looking at venues soon. MIL of course asked about the dress, what she should wear, what flowers there would be. Husband and I haven’t decided anything yet other than the date, the wedding parties, and the color scheme. MIL immediately said “I’m assume I’m not invited to the dress fittings?” 

I’ll be honest…. I hate shopping. So the only person who will for sure be there is my mom. I want to be in and out of the shop without getting overwhelmed. I told her as such. She seemed disappointed. Husband backed me up. 

Visit continues and MIL and husband start to argue as they do. Anything from government policy’s to climate change to personal life, including me. His grandparents just sit and avoid the argument. Husband’s nana tried to chat with just me, knowing how uncomfortable I was (this isn’t the first time and nana is a beautiful soul). Husband and MIL continue until MIL tells my husband he “can enjoy his death.” This was to make her argument point. Not a good point 😒

I had had it. I told her she was not allowed to speak to him like that or any of us present. That was incredibly rude and she does not get to say that in my house. OUR house. If she didn’t like that, she could leave. So she did. She stormed out, slamming the door behind her. She attempted to call the grandparents, and Pops told her to shape up and quit arguing. It clearly disturbs everyone and what she said was uncalled for and rude. She comes back to the apartment and apologizes for her behavior. My husband told her she doesn’t get to say things like she did and he is looking out for his family. MIL took that as she is no longer his family and that only I am the family. She again got angry. 

While that conversation/argument occurred, nana asked about a few objects I had on the coffee table. I have incense burners of all kinds. I asked if she wanted to see, and pulled out a downflow incense cone to show her what happens. It takes me about 2-3 minutes to get it lit and going. After 5+ minutes, MIL freaks out about the incense and how that affects her medically and she could end up in the hospital dead! She storms out a second time in 45 minutes. Both husband and I forgot she had scent issues, but we also have a lot of wall flowers and scents in the apartment, including candles and such. Yet it’s the act of me burning incense that’s triggers her. And for those that are still with me, yes, she did ask about flowers at the wedding and what kinds and wanted to show me arrangements. So I guess flowers, candles, and wall flowers are ok but incense aren’t? 

After she stormed out a second time, I started to have a panic attack. I’ve had a lot recently as the move was stressful and I have quit all of my jobs for the sake of my husband’s job. I have nothing but this apartment, him, and our cat at this new place. I’m incredibly stressed and heightened and emotional. I am looking into therapists since this hasn’t happened in a long time for me. 

We chose to try one more time at supper and MIL complained the entire time. It was to cold. Food was too expensive (it was Applebees before 6pm so happy hour). She said we needed the waitress right away because we wanted to order before the food got more expensive. I have worked in customer service for the past 12 years. I did not take kindly to her attitude towards those helping us, but didn’t say anything. My husband recognized I was agitated. Ultimately, she didn’t engage in conversation with the rest of the family and chose to scroll on her phone about 85% of the supper. When there was a problem with nana’s food, she also chose to make a scene with a leg cramp at the table, complaining that we should just chop her leg off. Not 10 minutes later, and it’s the other leg and same issue! And it’s my fault because I lit the incense and I should have known better. It was my fault. Because it’s always the “wifey’s” fault as she now calls me. 

I started to have another panic attack and excused myself. I left and sat in the car until husband left. Husband said he apologized to the waitresses and gave them the money I left behind for them. I did not say goodbye to the family because I was not in a good space to do so. 

A few days later, MIL sent a message in the group chat including husband, grandparents, uncle, and me. Her are the small bits involving me, direct quotes from the message. I am leaving some out because it pertains to husbands and MILs argument from earlier. 

“I really like your house. It seems comfortable and that there is plenty of room to be comfortable and move around.  I have been slowly going through the process of decluttering.  Glad you don’t have this tendency. The rooms seem good sized.  I’ll have to come one day and you can teach me pickle ball. With your wife’s permission of course.”

“I am very sorry for the first half of me leaving. OP and I are both strong personalities which seem to clash.  I will continue to try to be the bigger person.”

“The incense was so rude on her part.  I can not help that I have sMCAD, POTS and vEDS.  Just like you can not control having EDS and POTS.  I was still having cramping in my groins at 2am.  Fragrances can send me to the hospital.  It’s bad enough that I have lost two jobs due to my diseases that I have no control over.  Then I’m at my son’s home and have to sit in the foyer because your wife with no concern for my health lights incense.  I don’t know what to do but making me sick is going to further drive a wedge between us.”

“And I really don’t know what that was at dinner.  Getting up and leaving and never coming back to say goodbye, or thank you for dinner. I’m assuming she went to the car.  Why I don’t know but that’s just rude.  We drove an hour and a half to see you both and your home.”

I’ve decided I’m done and I will no longer be attending functions with his family involving his mother. Husband is supportive of this decision. 

A few weeks ago, I choose to block my MIL from my calls, texts, and few social medias she has access to. This is for my own sanity. I haven’t had a second thought about it until 2 days ago. My MIL told my husband to call her. Literally demanded he call her! All she wanted was to tell him they should do therapy together. My husband is in therapy from all the childhood trauma his mother has caused. The same cannot be said for MIL. My husband told her no, not until she seeks therapy herself and can apologize for her actions towards him and me. 

MIL didn’t like the response (obviously) and was gaslighting him for his childhood trauma. This includes physical, mental, and emotional abuse. 

MY HUSBAND HAS FINALLY BLOCKED HER IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE! 

And I couldn’t be more proud. He is also going through the legal channels to find the documentation from when he was taken away from his mother for abuse and placed with his nana for protective custody. MIL denies that that even happened. Yet here come the court documents. 

I am so proud of my husband. MIL will not be invited to our wedding celebration and we have made alternative plans with my husband’s grandparents to see them outside of family functions. I am looking forward to a more peaceful existence without the nonsense of MIL and her bullying. ",26,1741148742.0,motherinlawsfromhell,1,0.96,False

1j3uu1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyperthyroidism/comments/1j3uu1i/need_an_opinion/,Need an opinion,"Hi so I’m very new to all this information so please bare with me. I recently got a new family doctor after mine retired, the doctor said that i have a goitre on my neck and that my thyroid felt a bit inflamed. I was sent for an ultrasound and it confirmed i had a mildly enlarged thyroid, as well as some big words that basically said the tissue appears uneven, and a hyperaemia so higher blood floor than normal. I also went for the blood work, everything is normal. My free T4 is 18.7pmol/L, my T3 is 5.6pmol/L and my TSH is 2.10mIU/L.
I will say before i get into this that i was recovering from a cold during the ultrasound and during the bloodwork, both abt a week apart. I cannot remember if i was sick while at the doctors, but I assume sometime shortly after that it started.

She said i had hyperthyroidism when asked about my symptoms i was unsure so i said i didnt know, when i got home i looked up some of the symptoms and im still not sure. I havent seen any major weight loss of weight gain, I had an ECG and it came back normal, tho i took my blood pressure today and it was 130/83 pulse 93, nervousness for sure but if im being honest ive been a worrywart my entire life, irritability yes, i find it mostly at work i tend to get irritated quickly, i do work customer service so idk really, but i find it goes away quickly, same exact situation with the brain fog. trouble sleeping comes and goes, im sensitive to sound and everyone makes noise it the house, but i also sometimes have a coffee to close to bed so again i dont know. I have stopped drinking coffee for the mean time bc this does seem to be a give away for some, i am sleeping better so far. Sweating or heat intolerance, not really, i do work in a bakery so if its hot i do notice, but during times at home or just out and about i don’t experience this unless its a hot summer. Frequent bowel movements is a no, TMI but i have struggled with constipation for a long time, i think its lactose but i couldnt care enough to stop eating the occasional regular cheese. And then goitre, which yes i do have. Tremor i do not have unless i have gone a while between meals which i think is fair. Increased hunger is a no.Changes in menstrual cycle, again TMI but yes over the years i have noticed it get lighter and shorter but not painful. 
I will say however that i have not had the best year. Unfortunately towards the end of the year i lost my childhood dog of 12 years, one month later i lost my grandpa, and then one month later again i lost a close family friend, needless to say stress out is an understatement to what i was feeling.

Now i do have another appointment with my doctor because i was having trouble sleeping one night and when i went to get some water i noticed my neck was a bit more swollen, it has since gone down. 

Now after all the rambling, is a second opinion needed? I have seen many say to ask for a referral to an endocrinologist and im just wondering if this is really enough to warrant a visit. I am worried bc unfortunately despite my better knowledge i did a really big deep dive into hyperthyroidism and graves and i have given myself a bit of a scare. But i am unsure, the symptoms im having are not severe or stay for long periods of time, however the goitre is making me a bit worried. I understand that the thyroid can enlarge from stress and sickness but i am wondering if this is maybe something more, i did a dive through my previous doctors notes and my previous doctor had been regularly testing my TSH but i cant remember if this goitre has been there the whole time.

Anyways i just wanted to speak to someone about it because i dont believe my doctor or my family really understand my concerns.",1,1741148671.0,Hyperthyroidism,0,1.0,False

I’ve suffered with pain due to my hypermobility for years. I mostly work hybrid but in the office I’m meant to have a desk set up of an adjustable chair, arm rest, mouse mat and foot rest. I’m currently working in two different offices, one I never bothered to get my DSE done and the other I’m rarely in and we hot desk so I’ve long lost my aides (I know, I should get onto them).

But I’m actually thinking about my home setup. I have an ergonomic chair that’s kinda busted - I don’t really sit at my desk (it’s currently used as an overflow book shelf!) and instead on my sofa, propped up with lots of pillows and my laptop on a tray beside me. A lot more comfy! I sometimes sit on my busted chair with my laptop on the coffee table, usually for calls etc but this really irritates my already painful shoulder and some other tender places.

Does anyone have any good tips for when they’re working from home, particularly if you don’t have much space? Doesn’t need to be a grand home office. 

I’m in the UK so links etc to any products would be helpful. I can either request through work or if they’re slightly more unconventional I don’t mind buying for myself. ",1,1741148503.0,Hypermobility,0,1.0,False
1j3ur6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATHELP/comments/1j3ur6y/cat_having_teeth_extracted/,Cat having teeth extracted,"My almost 3 year old boy needs 5-6 and potentially more teeth extracted due to stomatitis. I wouldn’t be so worried if he didn’t have a food aversion to wet food… but he does, which is going to make feeding him after surgery near impossible. 

I gave him wet food with gabapentin once before a flight and he hated it and I think that’s what caused his aversion. I’ve tried to feed him at least 10-15 different wet foods to no avail. I’ve tried nutritional yeast, magic dust, and even mayo as toppers. I tried even grinding up his dry kibble in an electric coffee grinder but he didn’t eat that either. I also don’t want to have to withhold food from him every day just to get him to be hungry enough to try something new.

I’m guessing I’ll have to syringe feed him after the extraction. But he is flighty, and it will be difficult. I’m wondering if anyone has had experience with this and has any tips or advice — whether that be for food alternatives, or tips for syringe feeding him (how much and how often).

As the title says, I’m open to talk about anything and everything. I’m an open book. A little about me is I teach, I like to cook, I go to the gym almost everyday, and I play games whenever I have the chance! I like jazz music and enjoy a nice coffee with smooth music in the back. If you need an ear or anything or someone to listen to you I’m here for you! Don’t worry I don’t bite! Hahah, but feel free to drop your age and a little about you!

Pang SFW. Just wanna chill, yoko lang magisa. At least may tao akong kasama. After all the pain I've got, I jist want to roam around drama free with a random stranger with a feminine energy. I'm a feminine lesbian btw.

I'll go ahead, not looking for a hookup. But if yoy are, I'm game, make sure you're good looking and hygenic. Other than that I'm fine for coffee, talk aboit life, foodtrip, selfies and pasyal. 

Hindi ako probinsiyana, so I know I'm not boring to be with. I'm 5'4 fair-skinned, Long brown hair, ambivert, I'm a business woman - I am always into thinking of making money, investments, for the future and emergency, environmentalist and pretty chill person, ayaw ko ng nagmamadali, pero swapping pictures I want coz I don't wanna waste my time. I'm taking care of myself on a regular basis for my skin, hair and nails. I'm not saying I'm vain but just enough to look like an eye-candy in your eyes para attractive, para ganahan ka to meet me again just incase. Yeah, I am putting a lot of effort for my physical outlook, so internally coz how can other people accept you if pabaya ka sa sarili mo din. Also, I don't have braces, I don't have false teeth. I hope you too. 

I want an independent woman. Gusto ko yung ugali nila masipag, masikap, neat, on-time, productive... Even their negatives I also like - maldita, masungit, madamot paminsan minsan, kahit kuripot ka pa (coz this shows how hard-working you are, hindi ka waldas, hindi mayabang, at hindi pasikat or paimpress. I'm so done with all these. I can smell from a far if you are fake, paimpress and such. 

I want to go out with a person that can be a potential partner I'm not gonna lie, but there must be spark at least. So if you have these qualities feel free to reach out

You: 5'2 at least, 35 years old at least para level tyo sana ng maturity, from the South sana so it won't be a hassle to hang around on random days like breakfast, lunch or dinner, mabango - I love perfumes that's why I smell good, sana ikaw rin, Long hair sana and stylish hair. Oo we are getting old but at least age gracefully. Someone who can stand up for their point of view but can respect me as well, someone who is empathetic and understands that life and shit happens. But cool enough to embrace the challenges. Lastly, if you have a medical background - I will prioritize talking to you. Why? Coz I'm a frustrated Ortho-Surgeon. 

Sorry guys napahaba, i just want to cut down the chats and wasted time tapos di pala swak. Kase ayaw ko ng ganon, yung tipong alam. Mo na ngang wala sayo yung qualities, ipipilit mo pa rin.

Whoever you are na makakalunch out ko on Saturday... Im excited to meet you. 😊",0,1741148317.0,PHR4Rhookups30up,2,0.5,False
1j3upmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/distractible/comments/1j3upmp/lottes_black_black_gum/,Lotte's Black Black Gum,"I'm just re-watching the Wade's Food Questions episode right now and I just felt the need to just put a PSA out there about Black Black.

I first heard about them from my lawyer friend who used them regularly because as a lawyer and the work you do, you need the caffeine. Each piece of gum is equivalent to ONE CUP OF COFFEE in terms of effect, which has been on some of the labels in Japanese. How much they talk about that point varies in terms of what's being promoted, but that was a thing I had seen on a label before.

In the episode, Mark said he downed four pieces in one go, so he essentially had 4 cups of coffee.

There's been a few posts about people trying it and stuff, but not a lot of info about it otherwise. 

I live in Japan and also speak Japanese, so if you need any more info about the gum or something I can probably answer. I think I've tried the gum myself actually once when I was going somewhere with said lawyer friend and was tired and actually needed the pick me up. I otherwise have caffeine sensitivity like Bob's wife and can't regularly take in that much caffeine.",2,1741148257.0,distractible,0,1.0,False

I have to RTO 3 days/week. I'm playing along. But honestly, it's not horrible. Everyone is on their headphones in their own cubicle. Nobody talks to each other and could go all day without saying a word to anyone (no interruptions). There is free food and coffee. It's kind of like a coworking space with people from different companys. There is almost no collaboration or face to face time and nobody is trying to push that. The manager does a walk through a few times a day and high fives everyone but that's about it.

Other than sharing a bathroom and wasting gas money it's not terrible. I can't see how it raises productivity at all, but I'll take the food and coffee.",1,1741148200.0,RemoteJobHunters,0,1.0,False
