# GLIS GLIS : ADVENTURES IN THE TOILET HABITS OF MICE

Salute, reader, how goes your world?

Ah, Thanos, Thanos Thanatos, the playful cherubim Mouse who inhabits now the veil beyond; he (or she) sups with the ancestors. But it is time, then, to recognize the Coming Of Age of Hypnos and bestow him (or her) with a name proper for an adult; I but follow the fates in this regard; for: it is irreligious indeed to impose ones own whim upon a fellow who is not ones decided enemy, observe then the Roman naming convention as it has taken shape in the formative weeks for the Mouse known, in infancy, as Hypnos:

*Tertia: the plain numerical given name, being the third (tertius) live mouse caught during the Autumn,*

*Mus: her family name, being obviously a Mouse (mus),*

*Romula: her formative Legend that spoke to her character before she arrived at the age of maturity; as like Romulus and Remus, this cognomen as opposed to ‚ÄòHypna‚Äô which, to retain it, would be like naming an adult for their preference as a small baby (the reader forgive my intrusion into this text with my current preoccupation as I write on this subject of imposition upon children in particular),*

*Tertia Mus Romula*; hail your Prima Domina future mice! This brood mare of the wilds, may she copulate with and tyrannize over the more effeminate domesticated shop-bought mice in the near future; Tertia Mus, the reader salutes you, you who are this battle-hardened path-finder of the murky realms far beneath the Gripper Rod from those dark mysterious ancient labyrinths of Under-Floorboards where which dwelled giant Men with no heads but with faces in their entire torsos, you who returned to the diurnal realm and had the fortune or prodigy to find yourself snared but not dead and snared not merely by a soppy-minded barbarian, to be killed when caught, but by a Gentleman of Good Humour with the inclination to discover your optimal humours and utilities; as like to learn to utilize the wind in the sky to propel mighty warships.

Now, on this day, that being the seventh day from the Calends of Mars and the second of nine days until the Ides of Mars, it behoves this writer once more to reflect upon the lessons thus learned of the Glirarium‚Ä¶

It has not escaped my notice that Mice are very precise in their toilet habits and that, therefore, the notion of keeping them in a clay amphorae, giving them no toilet space at all, would not be very pleasant for them or for their taste, that indeed they would be swimming in each others urine and excrement for the entire duration of their captivity, of which: (from what scant information survives through the ignorant ages) of the Glirarium we might deduce at being at least one year and perhaps as much as three. Granted, then, this would mean disturbing the Mice to clean the (clay amphorae) but, to the overall mood of the Mice here; my point is that the Mice would be greatly distressed simply by having nowhere to defecate other than on themselves, or, at best, in a small pile in the middle of the living room, as it were, as they crowded around it or anyway overlooked it on ledges, to say nothing of the disturbance of a Human Hand. Contrarily: I have noticed that Mice will actually make use of intelligently placed facilities given them for a toilet, that this eliminates really the need to bother them by disturbing their sleeping quarters and preserves their hygiene of their own accord; simply: that when confined in a large cylindrical tube with only one way both out and in that they will be very careful to defecate and urinate by the door, the furthest point away from their sleeping quarters; both to mark their territory at the point of entry and to escape the smell and touch of excrement from contaminating their food supplies. Very smart.

In fact, it only came to my notice when observing a perfectly straight line of droppings laid out by the door and a yellowed cotton pad; the kind usually torn up into bedding, which had been folded into three pieces, by the mouse.

This reminded me greatly, albeit peripheral but nonetheless cogent, to the precision and intricacy I observed in koi fish; that when coloured blue stones (these just being those allegedly ‚Äúglow in the dark‚Äù things you can buy for nothing) were scattered into their water that they collected all of these up into one big pile in the middle of the pond ‚Äì as if gathering eggs perhaps ‚Äì but that the effort this would have taken the koi is quite staggering to consider to have moved, say, fifty stones either by knocking it along with their nose or brushing it by their belly, and that if it had not been the work of a single koi but a collective effort by the entire shoal was, then, ‚Äústaggering‚Äù indeed; the sort of ‚Äústaggering‚Äù that you would really need a good brain to comprehend in its depth and complexity and conclusion.

I am not entirely sure, then, how the (clay amphorae) model of the Glirarium would function with this added into the question ‚Äì my first thought is that if the amphorae was placed upon its side and a clear path of the bottleneck existed that this would be made use of and thus able to easily open up and scoop out without needing to go deep into the nest itself, although there is no real evidence of this in Etruscan and Roman models, certainly even to place the amphorae into a holder (as like a wine rack) would result in loose food falling through the air holes and, that I can recall, no amphorae exist with air holes bore onto only one side (although if it was observed that there was a different spacing of the air holes around the circumference of an amphorae that would lend itself to a horizontal positioning mode then that may offer as a proof).

Indeed, I am giving thought here as to the most optimal form of the Glirarium; something which preserves this horizontal cylindrical model and allows for better access at the same time; as it is with the cylinder: picking it up and positioning it vertically (as they spent the coldest months of winter in this manner) forces them to swim in excrement and thus requires them to be disturbed in order to be cleaned ‚Äì whilst, at the same time, the more Mice in a cylinder the more waste is generated ‚Äì perhaps I am giving too much thought to the matter entirely, and in fact perhaps the cylinder is perfect. ‚ÄúPerfect‚Äù at least as a winter holiday home that can be handled and heated simply enough, but I would still like to get a habitat with a great deal of floor space to let them idle in the summer, as like in Ancient Mykenos.

*Well, my cliens are at the door and begging I solve their problems, and the wretched glare of the Hateful Sol illuminates my office and whispers to me of ‚Äúgolf games‚Äù and ‚Äúcoffee (more expensive and worse quality than i make for myself)‚Äù so I leave you there reader; yet another day awaits.*

Valete,

I spend in February 10 days in the Yangtse Delta: 4 days in Shanghai, 4 days in Hangzhou and 2 days in Nanjing. This was my third trip in China (went to Xi'an and Shanghai pre pandemic).

I want to thank people on the various subreddit for those cities and r/travelchina as it helped me with the logistics and itinerary.

\- Shanghai : as it was my second visit I skipped the ""must see"" and focus on old favorites and old towns in Pudong. I visited the old towns of Xinchang and Gaoqiao, which was quite fun, specially Gaoqiao: no tourists whatsoever, a small local community (it was beautiful weather so lots of people outside, this created a nice atmosphere). I also went to 1933 for abstract architecture photography. Of course I passed by the Bund and Old Shanghai, near Yu Yu Garden (but not the Gardens themselves which are a zoo now), walked in the French Concession which is my favorite neighborhood of the city. I visited Longhua temple which was the only main temple of Shanghai I had not seen before. I obviously ate a lot of dumplings, including several times at Yang's dumpling, my favorite chain.

\- Hangzhou: the highlight of my trip. I found West Lake overrated. It is nice and relatively peaceful before 8:30 AM, with locals running, dancing, doing Tai'Chi or playing musical instruments. But it become a stressful zoo after, with too many people, too much noise and those dredged mini busses driving like idiots on the paths. I did a lot of early wake up before dawn to enjoy the Lake at those moments. But everything else around the Lake is just beautiful and lovely: the tea field of Longjin was a highlight, despite the heavy rain that day, the various temples (specially the Taoist temple on Baoshi mountain and Lingyin), the scenery, the peacefulness of it all. Food wise  I was quite impressed by Grandma's kitchen, less by Green Tea restaurant. And of course  I had several snacks on the night market.

\- Nanjing was very interesting, I had to rush a bit between sights since I was there 48 hours. I walked along the wall, saw part of the old town, the Jiming temple (lovely), part of the Purple mountain (the Ming tomb and the Sun Yat sen memorial, very impressive both), the Confucius temple. Dai Pai Dang restaurant is a clear recommendation from me, excellent food, maybe the best I had on this trip. The plum wine infused ribs were delicious.

I had a blast, everything works just fine and I loved the country and the people (except the scooter and mini bus  drivers). I had Ubigi as eSIM and this was just fine, Didi, Alipay and WeChat were setup before leaving, no issue there (I had one problem in a tea shop in Hangzhou). The people were always very helpful : a mini app requires a phone number to get coffee or a ticket ? No problem, staff always proactively offer a solution, even if it was themselves buying the ticket and using WeChat to transfer the money back to them. Amap worked fine, specially for buses itinerary in Hangzhou. Politics aside, the transformation the country had since my last visit is impressive. I hope they continue with the free visa for 15days for european visitors, I will be back.",1,1741253542.0,travelchina,0,1.0,False

We've all given ourselves up to a 2+ year commitment: writing 9-hour exams, investing in electives, dressing to deadlines, coordinating between medical bodies, smiling for interviews, and anticipating life-changing notifications.

And finally, making big decisions on ranking places we've never been to, hoping it'll be the best for us.

It's all come to an end... an end of an era. We'll remember every moment, phase, emotion, and importance.

I remember the countless nights spent studying, the early morning coffee runs, and the overwhelming sense of uncertainty that often felt suffocating.

But we made it. We survived the chaos, and we're stronger because of it.

I truly manifest that each one of us gets matched to a place that welcomes us as our new home, nurtures our hard work, and manifests it into future dream opportunities.

But tbh, we're already living our dream. Being done with ROL? Never thought this day would come so quick.

So appreciate yourselves and how far you've come... don't doubt your ROL, even if it's that last-minute change. Accept the decisions made as ones made from a lot of thought and feeling.

To everyone who's felt lost, uncertain, or overwhelmed, I see you. I hear you. And I believe in you.

We've got this. We're strong, resilient, and capable.

We're not just matching into programs; we're unlocking doors to new possibilities, new experiences, and new lives.

1j4rkxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1j4rkxs/should_i_bow_out/,Should I bow out?,"Just after Christmas I met a guy online. He was massively flirty and fun, but although we got along well i figured he was a player with some ""bad"" habits and at most he'd be a fun one- time date or just someone to chat with occasionally. He volunteered that he was seeing someone, not exclusivity, that lived a plane ride away so was still seeing other people, preferably someone closer to him.  We both figured we'd see each other once and that would be it.  About a month later we finally went out,  dinner and a movie, had some great chemistry,  including physically, and tentatively made a plan for a 2nd date. Still, im thinking this won't amount to much, he's fun but I don't like to date/sleep with multiple guys at once. 3 days later he came to my place for ""a day or 2"" to hang out, ride motorcycles, etc. That turned into a week. Each day we were both amazed at how much we had in common,  how well we clicked, etc. so we kept saying he'd go home ""tomorrow."" By the last day we agreed he needed to do some ""thinking"" because I wasnt going to be a side piece and,  although we didn't plan for it, we both had developed feelings for one another. We took one last motorcycle ride before he was heading home and unfortunately got into a minor accident. I was fine but he ended up with a badly broken leg. 3 days later he's discharged from the hospital after a lengthy surgery and can't walk on,  or bend, that leg for 3 weeks!

Now, he lives 2 hours away from me and his living situation isn't exactly conducive to a wheelchair so I say he can stay with me until we figure out how to get him home (his family was not an option.) For 2 weeks I take care of him in between movie marathons, naked nerf-gun fights, wheelchair-slow dancing by candlelight, building fires, roasting marshmallows, playing poker, beating each other at Jeopardy, and a lot of incredible sex. It's romantic and exciting; neither of us planned on liking each other so much. Enter the ""other girl,"" who i affectionately started calling ""not girlfriend"" since he insisted their relationship wasn't exclusive like that. In the beginning of our 2nd date he wasn't texting/ calling her because he was ""with me"" but after the accident, and now 3 weeks later,  he's started to text/call her, but not before she started getting suspicious, texting his friends, and finally telling him she feels like he's pulling away (which he denies.) Apparently they had pre-existing plans for the NG to fly up and stay with him so she reschedules her flight for when he's home. So, after an incredible week getting to know each other, and 2 weeks of recuperating that felt like we'd been a couple for months, I took him home. NG arrived the next day. 

OK, I'm thinking ""back to reality; "" this was supposed to be a one time thing,  and seeing his NG again will clear his head and he'll  remember how much he likes her and give me the push- which is probably for the best, i don't want to compete for a guys attention. He was scheduled for a 3 week post-op apt and I had offered to take him IF he needed a ride and a couple days before NG was leaving he said yes, he did need a ride and he'd love to see me again (he had texted/called me a few times during her visit.) I drove up to his house literally 15 minutes after NG left for the airport. He was ecstatic to see me,  lots of hugs and kisses, more sex, and it was like we just picked up where  we left off. We talked on the way back to my place; no,  he hasn't made ""a decision"" about us.  He hasn't been able to be alone with his thoughts, talk to family and friends about what to do, etc. I call bullshit but whatever- after his post-op visit he'll be ""done"" needing any more help from me so we can get some time apart, him without NG, and figure out where we're at and how we feel. But, once again, fate steps in- he has a massive wound infection. Back to the hospital, another surgery, tons of lab work and antibiotics. After 5 days he's discharged and, again, stays with me until his post op apt 10 days later. By now it feels like we've been ""dating"" for months even though this is technically our 3rd date. Except for 4 days he's lived with me and my 3 dogs for 6 weeks!! 

We kno ea others"" morning routines, bathroom habits, coffee drinks, food likes/dislikes, fav TV shows, sleeping patterns, and even shower and get dressed together. We've  exchanged tales of family drama, first kisses, trips taken, past relationships and mistakes we made in them. Ive spoken to his father and brother numerous times;  first to update them on his surgery,  and then when he calls them himself since every phone call he makes is on speaker phone (except for NG.) I've met/talked to several of his friends via speaker phone and video chat, went to a super bowl potluck at his friend's home (we brought 7-layer dip) and attended several services at the local chapter of his childhood church. In his church his father was the pastor and his sis-in-law is the current pastor. I met, and got to know, people he's grown up with in the church and,  through them, have gotten to know him even more. 

Now, somewhere along the line my heart made a decision my head didn't agree with: keep seeing him, while he continues to see NG, with the understanding that dating us both isn't a long term plan. BUT, eventually one of these relationships will fizzle out/run its course, and/or the other relationship will clearly be where his heart is. 2 weeks ago that seemed like a great idea. But now, as I write this on the night before I take him home, I'm worried I'm setting myself up for heartbreak. I figured the more time he spent with me he'd eventually figure out I was ""the one,"" for lack of a better title. He and I both ride motorcycles, she doesn't. I have a good career and am financially stable. She's a dog walker, bit coin-investor, still has roommates and just borrowed a large sum of $$ from him. I'm 2 hours away by car, she's 2 hours away by plane. He's been dating her (and others) for 6 months but in terms of actual time together it's just been a week or 2 here and there and he stays in a hotel when he visits her (apparently her roomie doesn't like him.) We've been LIVING TOGETHER for 6 weeks-grocery shopping, cooking, doctors and dentists apts, etc. But today, after the doc apt, he spent 30 min on the phone with NG ironing out plans for her next visit in a couple weeks so he clearly hasn't made a decision. When pressed he'll only say that he hasn't been completely alone at his own house in 6 weeks so he hasn't really had a chance to think things through and decide, he's  been recovering from 2 surgeries and dealing with a lot of pain. He admits this situation isn't ""right"" or ""fair"" but neither of us expected to like each other this much so he's not sure exactly what to do; according to him he likes us both equally. I think he considered NG his ""main squeeze"" but had a revolving door of ""side pieces"" to keep him company in between visits with NG. He didn't plan on liking this side piece so much. 

So, do i make the decision for him and take myself out of the equation? Or do I chill out, let him think a bit and wait for his answer?  Wait a certain amount of time then back out if he hasn't  decided? 

A few important details: I'm a nurse so caring for him came naturally. I stayed overnight at the hospital with him every day on each of his stays-helped him bathe, use the urinal, changed his linen (I got bored) and helped interpret the medical arena for him. I did almost the same once he was at my home recovering. He drinks,  a LOT, and I don't. He also smokes and I don't.  He's got a history of 3-5 year  relationships where the women ""get tired of his bullshit"" - his words, with one 10 year marriage. He's had a ton of jobs, mostly in customer service, and is currently in-between jobs. He's living at his childhood home with his dad after a recent breakup and to help his dad recover from hip surgery.  So, he's in a ""transition"" period. To be fair, I am as well.  Divorced 18 months,  recovering financially after giving my ex $300k of my retirement,  and currently renting a home. 

So no, he's definitely not an ideal candidate for a partner but dammit I can't help myself- there is just SO MUCH more to this guy then his short list of ""cons.""

I'm 55, and just a dopey GWM who can't get to sleep. )

I think it's a sad, brave, moving anecdote, esp for women: 

These are the kind of bits of LBGTQ+ history that if not told, vanishes. 

So K-State is right next to Ft. Riley w/15,000 military members, Ft. Leavanworth has a base in KS,  the town Melissa Etheridge is from, and other similar military-related sites are heavily-present in that state.   
I haven't seen that mentioned in that TV show, but the town has a strong lesbian / bi presence spilling-over from Ft. Riley. 

I came out immediately, coming from a Catholic prep school in St. Louis, and there were a lot of LGBTQ+ students and faculty in the architecture programs I was in,two women, at least two men, others. But what's the better point to address is that this pre-dated \*Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\* and, sorry, but, yeah, the bases' female soldiers had a large, significant presence. So then most of the LGBTQ+ people I knew were lesbian / bi women, a couple dozen. 

I am pretty strongly male-gender typed, a feminist and liberal, and got along with them well. I can't tell ya how many potlucks I went to or the number of softball games I cheered the ladies on at. When you meet a certain crowd, you meet more. 

Some were in ""lavender marriages"", married to gay/bi men, but there was and is a lot of tolerance for women not straight on base.   While being a gay or bi guy would be dangerous if discovered, I was told women were booted-out for little valid reason, any reason to make unwelcome servicemembers who were female and it not valued soldiers, sexism a part of the military's values. Female soldiers often said the military views female members as either ""Gay or gender-defying Nuts or Sl\^ts"", 

So, let me get to the point:  There were no gay bars around, a coffee house kind of ""gay-friendly"", and the student org was about 30/70, M to F, not the norm for LGBTQ student groups, woomen then and maybe still, sort of edged out by males or just feeling underrepresented or not feeling it represented themselves.  The first LGBTQ+ bar I went to was either in Topeka or Wichita, I can't remember. It was from at least the late 60s, and at the entrance, there was a vestibule where you had to show ID and get looked over, violence and harassment all-too-common then. People didn't congregate outside gay bars like other regular bars when it's closing time, bottles or worse lauched at patrons for just being.  Above you, there were a couple red-flashing lights, what the doorman would turn on to warn the bar patrons an unwelcome troublemaker in the form of police, military police-types or dangerous ppl who cause problems were trying to enter, But if you were of the military, the front door could be dangerous to one's career, when it was known the military sometimes had a car sitting outside running license plates and taking picitures of patrons, I guess who could be really harmed by being found out. The back area of the bar that faced some wooded area had en entry way too. Military members, as a women at the bar who was talking to be and my lesbian friend, told us that miliitary members would sneak in through the back door, sometimes literally having to get on their hands and knees to avoid being seen. There were sets of spare civilian clothes for those who would get dirty/ muddy traversing through the wooded area.   Can you imagine, the legit fear and dread, such repercussions could result for just trying to associate with others potentially dangerous and devestating.And as our fearless Commander of the Armed Forces Pres Donald Trump is being hostile to women serving, esp on a battlefield, possibly ending soon, we have to remember it also within a historical perspective.  Carrying the double-version of oppression, women who are L / Bi / G get sexism multiplying and compounding their struggles and fears.

Lesbain pulp fiction magazines often portrayed some female characters in the military.

they show up randomly, let themselves in if the door is unlocked, and don‚Äôt care if the baby is napping. they‚Äôll scoop her up, wake her up, overstimulate her, and then‚Äîwhen she inevitably starts screaming‚Äîhand her back and say, ""oh, she must be hungry"" before peacing out. they‚Äôve also made themselves at home in ways that drive me insane. they help themselves to food, make coffee, and once my fil even fell asleep on our couch for two hours.

i tried being nice about it. i hinted. i joked. i even said, ""hey, can you guys text first before coming over?"" nothing changed. so after they showed up at 7am on a saturday (because ""we just couldn‚Äôt wait to see our grandbaby!!""), i finally put my foot down. i told them from now on, they need to text and confirm a time before visiting.

cue the meltdown.

my mil teared up, saying i was trying to ""schedule away"" their relationship with their granddaughter. my fil made sarcastic comments like, ""should we take a number next?"" my husband is stuck in the middle, because while he agrees they‚Äôre overstepping, he also doesn‚Äôt want to hurt their feelings.

These days I feel like my dopamine has crashed. I don't feel the same way and even after a rewarding situation, I'm not getting the happy hormones release that I used to. I feel like I got stupid. I can't even talk. Words don't come out of my mouth. I know that something is wrong because there times when I feel how i used to so...it's a day and night difference.

During my brief stint atop the greasy pole of celebrity-stardom; sipping cocktails and shaking hands in the VIP area of a members-only club in Soho, I was once introduced to the iconic journalist Emily Mathis.   
  
*""Tell her something about sexism against men and boys George!""* I was told, alongside a back-shattering pat on the back, far too hard for someone holding such a tall coffee-based cocktail as mine.   
  
I didn't expect *""my moment""* to be quite like this.  
  
So soon, and so sudden, unceremoniously shoved in front of perhaps the most influential journalist in the country, a life-time opportunity dropped onto my lap to *finally* sound the alarm for so many of the things I quietly plug away at online.  
  
Sipping my cocktail with an air of mostly performative confidence, I paused, as I went through my mental Rolodex...  
  
Too many things to tell her  ‚Äì  
  
Nothing too controversial I thought.   
Something factual and inarguable.   
Something relevant to the U.K.  
Something that'll whet her leftist appetite.   
  
Something *watertight.*  
  
So I went with the judicial system, and sentencing bias...  
  
""Well Emily... Did you know, according to the Ministry of Justice, British men face an 88% higher chance of imprisonment than British women do, even under similar criminal circumstances?""   
  
And nothing. Literally nothing.   
  
Well it was a busy party, maybe she didn't hear ‚Äì   
  
I spoke a little louder:   
  
""So imagine a man and a woman in criminal court ‚Äì *same* crime, and *same* criminal record; and the man is nearly twice as likely to go to prison than the woman is... *incredible* right?""  
  
Blank face.   
  
""Of course the same applies to black people, but American research finds that the gender sentencing bias, is roughly **six times** larger than the racial sentencing bias. This means if you're a black man, you pay a double penalty of both...""  
  
And she's gone.   
  
Still politely stood there of course, nodding, but with a blank stare, that is quite clearly waiting for me to stop talking.  
  
*""Emily Malaise"",* I'd later call her.  
  
As I looked up at the ceiling of my bedroom, lying next to my girlfriend, recounting the story with what I am sure was the same puzzled expression.  
  
What struck me was a lesson worth more than all those golden handshakes, and expensive cocktails.   
  
The realisation that the problem is *not* sentencing bias at all, but rather, nobody gives a flying fuck about it, and not even the most powerful journalists in the land.   
  
She could have done something right then and there.  
  
Just a few clicks into her phone's keypad, and a flick through her black book, and the men and boys in prison, and the many more outside of it, suffering, could have been saved.  
  
But no.  
  
I don't get invited to those parties anymore, and so I shout into the void instead; arguing to myself in showers, pleading to nobody at bus stops, and shadow boxing with politicians in my mind.  
  
It seems quite clear, we are on our own, and we'll have to build these four walls ourselves.   
  
So what happens next? I don't know.  
  
But I am sure it won't come from that party, nor the powerful individuals inside of it. ",22,1741251480.0,TheTinMen,2,0.96,False

Hello fellow potatoes,
Looking for some advice.

I (32f) have 4 siblings (34f, 25m, 15m, 13m). I love them dearly. However, I feel guilty, because I am getting jealous, not of my siblings, but of my parents relationship with some of them.
Let me give some context about my siblings:

K (34f) is engaged with 5 kids and another on the way.
J (25m) lives with his bio dad and has a girlfriend.
M (15m) lives with my parents, in high school and has a girlfriend.
L (13m) is also in high school, lives with  parents, and extremely smart.
As for myself, I am married, have a baby, and am currently studying, and on a break from work

My parents have always been supportive of my decisions, yet have called me out on my BS when deserved, like a good parent does. They have done this with all kids and treated us the same. Until recently...
I used to talk to my parents about everything, whether it be relationships, general advice, etc. I used to also see them quite often. But for the past year, they have started talking to me less and less. Whenever I do see them, they are constantly saying how my younger brother (M) has an amazing gf. Don't get me wrong, she is amazing. But the way they talk about her, they never talk about my husband that way. 

Ever since I met my husband, they haven't seemed to like him. This doesn't really surprise me, as they haven't liked any of my previous partners, havent liked any of my sisters (K) partners (she was married and had been engaged previously), and haven't liked my brothers (J) partners. They always say my husband is a 'nice enough guy', but they think he has changed me. I do agree, but he has changed me for the better. Since meeting him, he supported me and convinced me to go back to uni, helped me change my eating habits (I've never been big, but I've always wanted to lose weight), and helped me to take pride in my appearance, as I was always self conscious about how I look. 

When my son had his first birthday, last week, we didn't see anyone else ON his actual birthday, we tried to arrange a catch up with family for a different day, both on my side and my husbands side. But my parents were ""too busy"" to even do coffee. 

Anyway, I don't know how to talk to my parents about this. I don't know how to approach them with hiw I'm feeling regarding the jealousy, as well as why they don't want to see me as much any more. It really hurts that they don't want to see us as much, especially for my son too. 

I know I went way off topic, but any suggestions or thoughts about how to talk to them would be great. I've tried in the past, but they just say 'its fine, there's nothing wrong' 

Please ask questions if you want 

Further context:
My siblings and I have the same mum, but so w different dads
K and I have the same bio dad (out of the pic)
J has a different dad 
M and L have same dad (technically my step dad, but since meeting him, he has become my dad)

Just came back from Ash Canyon, got technical backpack, woordworking tools, the usual stuff, and i was thinking on going back to Mistery Lake to drop most of the loot, do repairs, you know.

When reaching Timberwolf mountain, i decided i would make the most of the trip and loot the summit so i went for it from the Deer Clearing access. Already struggling with weight, despite backpack and well fed, managed to reach summit and spent a few days there, also had to kill a couple wolves with the bow. 

With all the loot i was on around 48kilos, decided to drop some of it and return some other time. And here is where the mistake comes:

**A series of mistakes and misfortunes:** I started billy goating down to Crystal lake but went too far on the left so i ended up by the engine on the ravine (and got several sprains, torn clothes...)  
 *Just a small mistake* right? Thought i would rest on the cave and repair some clothes, but i had no food (didn't want to loose Well Fed and struggle even more with being overweight) so why not loot the container and pray for food? Well, wolf came, missed my shot, luckily i won the struggle. Of course no food in container.

By this point i was already very anxious, it was night but i tried to start the trail back to mountaineers. Because of darkness, came face to face with that damn bear, turned around and run for my life. Stayed for a bit in the cave while i kept consuming my teas and ruined food so i wouldn't loose the bonus (luckily didnt catch parasites).  
Second attempt: Spotted the bear so i turned around again and went for the deer carcase, sadly lost the bonus but got some food.   
Third attempt: Couldn't see the bear but by the moment i made the turn to go out of the ravine there it was... i climbed to a rock in the right wall so he wouldn't get me and waited for him to go away ( i was freezing and starving).

Finally made it out of the ravine, but didn't have much time. Had no sticks or timber, no food, no teas of coffee. I run towards the hut and encountered... a pack of Timberwolves. God damn it Hinterland. I thought i was dead since i didn't have no health to sustain their attacks, nor time for fire or other strategies... so i popped a stim and run, somehow i made it to the hut to gain some warmth. Slept like 1 hour and went for some cattails ( thanks past me for not consuming them all). 

Now a couple days have passed, i have hunted the few rabbits and cattails around, timberwolves and normal wolves very close but i have to move so i don't starve. I have crafted a travois so i can move easier with all that loot. 

**Some thoughts:** Obviously it was the mistake on the way down from summit what put me in this situation, but everything started because of my greedy ass carrying too much shit. I was so confident that the worse had passed, and almost lost my run because of it. I think overconfidence kills us so many times, for me it's that and also that i am an impatient person so i am thinking on the next thing rather that what i am doing at that very moment.

THANK YOU for reading all this, i hope it was entertaining or even you can learn something out of it.

Stay warm fellow survivors.
