1plegjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1plegjs/i_f20_want_my_boyfriend_m21_to_eat_more_than_just/,"I (F20), want my boyfriend (M21) to eat more than just fried food","We've been together for a few years. He literally only eat fries or burgers (no veggies, or picks them out). I haven't seen him eat a proper vegetable the whole time we have been together.

I really love him and want him to be healthy, but his adamant refusal to try any different foods drives me insane. I'm someone who likes to make sure I eat a variety of vegetables, and different foods since I love trying food from other cultures.

I tried getting to the source of the problem. I think he's just a verrryy picky eater who didn't grow up trying many foods at all. At home, his family only gets takeout like pizza, KFC, or burgers. When his family makes dinner at home, he just makes himself some fries. His family is pretty well off, and he has a job, so, honestly, he has access to healthy food. 

We like to update each other on what we are eating, and it's always fries or burgers, or toasties with just cheese. 

I get being a picky eater, but what he doing is so unhealthy. He doesn't drink much water either, only no sugar soda and sugary coffees/milkshakes.

It really frustrates me personally since sharing and trying food together is a big part of my love language, so when he refuses to try foods from my culture, or opts for only fries and pizza in an all you can eat restaurant, it annoys me.  

The effects of this? My boyfriend gets sick quite often, is always tired, and he complains about aches and pains everywhere. Honestly, he doesn't look healthy sometimes. It scares me since quite a few of his family members have type 2 diabetes, and one of his immediate family members got it very young.

I've told him to eat more vegetables, and try different foods (as well as drink water since his current diet i so unhealthy), but he ignores me or gets offended. We've had arguments over his diet - how when I took him to a restaurant with food from my culture, he refused to try some, or when we went to a Grill, he only got fries the whole 2 hours - since it has a clear effect on his health, and it pisses me off. 

I'm at a loss. I tried to start small - pastas with chicken, sandwiches with veggies, small bites of things - but it has gone nowhere. He promised me he would try change and expand his diet, but this whole time, nothing has changed. He just refuses to try ANYTHING. Just burgers and chips. A ham and cheese croissant sometimes. Steak, but not eating the salad. 

I can't control what he does - he's an adult. I just want him to be healthy, and, maybe selfishly, want him to try new foods with me.

I feel like I've tried everything. What do I even do? Anyone who has been in a similar situation?

But since the topic was a year ago, I couldn't post anymore comment to that topic, so Im starting mine. My husband told me that sex is his love language recently. We are married for over 10 years now. Our sex life is really great. But since having kids and now I'm in my early 40s, I was not as hyper-sexualized (is that a proper term?) as before. When we just got married, I used to want it almost everyday, more than once per day if possible. He used to be the one to say ""no"" to me. I don't know what went wrong, after having children, my libido just went downhill, I guess. Now, we have sex every 2 to 3 days. If I am in the mood, once per day in a two to three day period. Then he would want it often. Like maybe in the morning and then in the night again, and then the following night maybe, and when he doesn't get it on the 3rd time (second night) he gets upset. There was one time he wanted it so bad, I did not want to do it because I was itching down there. He said I was just making an excuse and that he didn't see me scratch in the day. He was so frustrated. He started watching porn while laying down next to me, even tuning the volume up. I was so annoyed. I couldn't sleep until he put down his phone. The following morning, I was having a terrible headache, I couldn't get up to prepare the kids for school so he was the one who prepared them, he got so angry. He goes on saying that he knows he is broke right now and that he knows that, that is the reason why (I'm not in the mood). Also that if I am not going to help prepare the kids to school, I must give him a heads up the night before. After two days, I eventually gave him sex, I initiated it. And then the cycle continues: he gets it three more times in 2 days. He is a great guy. He makes me coffee every morning. He tells me he loves me. He is a good provider. Shows me love other than sex. But I don't understand why he cannot just accept that if I am not in the mood, I'm just not in the mood. He often demands explanation. He questions why am I not in the mood, did he not do it good the last time, am I upset at him, did he do anything wrong... When simply, Im just really not in the mood. Recently he told me that ""sex is my love language"". In our over 10 years of marriage, this is the first time I heard him say that. Now I feel pressured. I sometimes feel objectified. He loves touching me. Everywhere, especially on my butt. I sometimes don't mind it, but I complain most of the time. He will then make a remark that ""you should be happy I find you attractive"". When he touches me, he gets so turned on, sometimes even when he just caresses my legs. I don't know how to feel sometimes. Should I, be, indeed happy he gets a ""boner"" every time he touches me? Because, honestly, I sometimes wonder if he only touches because he wants sex. I sometimes have to cover my butt just to prevent turning him on when I know I am not in the mood for it. And when I do that, he takes offence to that too. Is there something I am missing here? I do love my husband and I find him attractive, I just can't do it as often as he wants to.

I love it at home, in the quiet, before the world decides what kind of day it wants to be. I grew up seeing my parents cradle their mugs every morning, steam drifting between them like a soft conversation they never had to speak out loud. And somewhere in that routine, I learned that coffee isn’t just a drink. It’s a moment. A pause. A tiny rebellion against the chaos waiting outside.
I love the little kick it gives you—the spark under your ribs, the subtle tremble in your fingers, that heartbeat that skips like it’s reminding you that you’re alive, you’re here, you’re moving. Coffee makes the world sharper, clearer, like someone finally twisted the lens into focus.
But you know what I love more?
Coffee shops.
There’s something sacred about them—like stepping into a chapel built for the restless, the hopeful, the heartbroken, the dreamers who scribble on napkins because they can’t afford to lose what came to them in a rush. The moment you push open the door, the air changes. The smell hits you: warm, roasted, familiar. It crawls into your chest and settles there like an old friend. Pastries glow behind the glass like they’re posing. Food that tastes better simply because it’s eaten in a place where stories float in the air like dust caught in a beam of light.
And then—if you sit long enough and listen close enough—you start to hear the pulse of the place.
Whispers of first dates, all nerves and laughter.Friends reunited, voices cracking from joy.After-party survivors nursing both caffeine and regret.Quiet celebrations disguised by paper cups.Students drowning in notes.Workers escaping deadlines.Someone crying softly behind a book.Someone falling in love across the table, pretending they’re not.
Every corner holds a different universe, but somehow they all fit. Somehow they all make sense. Coffee shops collect people the way shelves collect books—different genres, different stories, all touching spine to spine. And maybe that’s why I love them more than the coffee itself.
Because a coffee shop is proof that strangers can sit inches apart, living completely different lives, yet share something without saying a word. It’s a small, warm room that wraps its arms around anyone who wanders in—no questions asked, no stories required.
I think that’s what pulls me back every time.Not just the caffeine.Not just the comfort.But the community—messy, beautiful, diverse.All these different walks of life, somehow orbiting the same small space, drawn together by the simple desire for a good cup, a soft seat, a moment to breathe.
Oh, how I love coffee.But oh—how I worship the place that holds it all together.

This are the components and specs:

Full carbon lightweight/stiff, yet comfortable. 

954g for 54 cm frame 

Full 12 speed 105 groupset and crank + carbon wheels, integrated carbon bar/stem, and carbon seatpost.  

Full manufacturer’s warranty on all components. 2 year frame/fork, 1 year components. 

The aerodynamic carbon frame is paired with a Shimano 105 mechanical groupset and 105 hydraulic disc brakes, offering crisp, reliable shifting and confident braking under pressure. Up front, a sleek carbon integrated bar and stem set the tone for a fast, modern cockpit, while our proprietary Bright STW 50mm tubeless-ready carbon wheels deliver a responsive, smooth-rolling ride — perfect for climbs, crits, or coffee loops.

This inaugural edition of the STW isn’t just a bike — it’s a launchpad. As a first-year owner, you’ll be eligible to receive a second or third generation Bright STW frameset as they are released (timeline TBD) — at your discretion and at no additional cost. And you get to keep the original frame, because your journey is worth remembering.

She didn't like the creaking wheel, the rusted iron that contracted from heat loss with a gasping hitch and sigh.

*crack-swish-crack-swish….*

“It sounds like a spade hitting dirt…” Andile whispered, “like it’s burying a corpse…”

Her albino-blue gaze shifted from the window to me; her irises glinting like a lizard's eyes in the moonlight. My fingers tightened in my bedsheets.

*“Sleep sister,”* I said in Zulu, *“Before the ancestors listen, and the stars twist your words…”*

She sighed, and turned on her side in her bed.

Her comment made thoughts trace my skull like skinned fingers, and sleep escaped me until the witching hour.

Usually, the windmill was a comfort. But tonight? Tonight, I remembered…

I remembered my uncle shoveling the earth under the windmill. I closed my eyes and memories clawed forward behind my eyelids.

*I was turning eight at the time… And my uncle had gotten me an orange kitten. But it was hidden in a cardboard box with pencil-sized holes for breathing.*

*Three girls, Andile and her friends, had dropped rocks inside, laughing as the feline hissed and yowled.*

*It was the worst birthday of my life, and yet, it felt like it was *my* hand that took life. As if I was a cruel master to a kitten once named Ginger-Bear.* 

It seems only now, in the solitude of a creaking windmill, that I remember my hatred for my younger sister on that day...


Sleep finally stole me from my wandering thoughts as the stars winked. Their light-breathing bodies seemed… faintly alive.

My dream was of my grandfather. A good man with a quiet life. A witch doctor who had been institutionalized in my junior year of high school. No one took it seriously. His delusions were taken as prophecies by most of my tribe.

But here, in my mind, he was… sane. Sober. 

I remember... sitting on the patio with my friend, Sifiso, talking to the wise man that had raised me.

Then, my sister walked in with *koki corn.* A dessert snack after our Sunday dinner. 

My grandpa reached for it--- Andile grabbed his hand, her pale fingers brushing over his scarred knuckles. “Tell us about the stars, *ugogo*...”

The old man’s blind eyes narrowed as he tilted his head, pondering.

“The stars, they speak in the darkness of the mind… the body… and the night.” He retracted his hand as he went into a trance-like state. 

I shivered at his words, glancing at Sifiso---

“They wanted my eyes,"" my grandfather murmured.

My blood chilled at *ugogo's* next words: ""To see humanity…. To creep closer to our world through flesh…”

My sister smoothed her apron, unfazed, as my friend and I stared at my grandfather. Andile said something about ‘brewing coffee’.

I crossed my arms to cover the goosebumps that prickled my skin. I just nodded as she left. “Thanks, sister.”

The dream ended quietly after that.

But, sometimes, I recount the witch doctor's words from my liminal state. Sometimes, I look back on those... 'memories'. 

And I wonder about my sister who had downy white hair like a newborn goat and had bleary-blue eyes that were red-rimmed in the sunlight-- like a woman who cries too much to her ancestors. 

She was a strong Zulu girl, and old enough to accept lobola from my best friend. Their wedding was in winter. At sunset. 

It felt... wrong. I never went. Andile begged me but I refused, and Sifiso never spoke to me again.

After 60 years of living, I asked my mother about my sister.

My mother paused where she was washing the dishes. “Ah– *sister*? My dear boy, you mean the fruit of my womb. The one who died six weeks into growing?” She wiped her hands off her apron, “*its flesh is buried under the windmill. It'll be 52 years this winter…*” my mother muttered in Zulu. 

But for me, the flesh had breathed all those years. A star-woman who wore my dead sibling like a coat in false memories.",1,1765604799.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

Hobbies/interests: Really big gamer, been gaming for over 20 years. Favorite franchises are Halo & Fallout but I have many other games I will play, especially with friends! Recently getting back into snowboarding, I enjoy fishing & shooting. Super into coffee & knowledgeable about it, love to cafe hop. Kinda love nerding out about things I’m passionate about, forewarning.

Tell us a bit about your Christian journey: Been a believer since I was 12 years old, grew up in a non-denominational background but since have more closely identified with Reformed Baptist. Definitely not a perfect Christian but I strive to live for the Lord and shine His light through me.

What sort of person are you looking for? Looking for a woman who loves the Lord but knows that I’m also human, that I’m also a sinner who makes mistakes. But I also grew up with sisters and have a lot of respect & patience for women. I will go to the ends of the Earth for my person & will try my best to be the image of Christ for her. Looking for someone who is modest & kind, someone who is willing to be alone, but not single. The nature of my job can be challenging, but does not determine the love I’m capable of giving. I want someone to be able to do life with.

​Personal Care/Health: (e.g., ""Getting the last bit of toothpaste out of the tube,"" or ""Organizing all my vitamins/supplements."")

For over a year now the thoughts of breaking up with her have been in the back of my head.

It feels as though she is just incapable of listening to my problems anymore. I have brought up issues of her not recognizing the things I do for her like making coffee in the morning. In fact anytime I do something for her there always seems to be something wrong. She'll say things like: ""The coffee just tastes different when you make it,"" in a negative way. Or if I do all the chores she will point out the single thing I missed and won't even give me a thank you. All I want is a simple thank you, but it feels like it is so much to ask for from her.

On top of that I just feel like she doesn't listen to me. I always try to talk to her about things I'm interested in but it feels impossible to hold her attention for more than 30 seconds. Anytime I ask her if she wants something from the store or while I'm out of the house she'll just say no because she's not listening and then be upset when I come back and I'll have gotten something for her as a surprise and it wasn't what she wanted.

The worst part is that I've tried to bring these issues up with her and she just never seems to make the effort to change. Maybe the first day after I mention it I'll notice a slight change but then it's over soon after.

I'm feeling so stuck because despite all of this I really care about her and I just miss the way she used to be. I remember she used to appreciate the things I did for her so much and I just remember it seemed like she really adored me. I miss that feeling and I want the old her back. I feel like telling her all of this would crush her but at the same time we definitely need to talk. 

TLDR is that I have been having thoughts of breaking up with my girlfriend, but I still love her and want to tell her about my feelings so we can move forward. How can I communicate this to her?",1,1765604055.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

1pldoz2,https://i.redd.it/6tk4qk2kqw6g1.png,Best AI for Dating Background Investigator: How Smart Technology Protects Your Heart and Wallet in 2025,"Modern romance has a dark side. While [**60.5 million Americans**](https://www.statista.com/topics/2158/online-dating/) used online dating services in 2024, they also faced unprecedented risks. Romance scammers stole [**$1.14 billion from Americans in 2023**](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/02/love-stinks-when-scammer-involved), and [**nearly 59,000 people**](https://www.globaldatinginsights.com/featured/boomers-lose-the-most-as-romance-fraud-rises-across-the-u-s/) fell victim to catfishing schemes in 2024 alone. The question isn't whether you should verify someone before meeting—it's which tool does it best.

[**Dating Background Investigator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator) represents the cutting edge of intelligent verification technology, conducting multi-lingual searches across Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok, and dozens of other platforms to build a complete picture of who you're really talking to—all in under five minutes.

**What makes this the best AI for dating background investigation:**

✅ **Intelligent multi-lingual search** – Automatically detects and searches in both English and native languages based on name etymology  
  
✅ **16-26 targeted verification queries** – Systematic research across social media, professional networks, news archives, and public records  
  
✅ **Progressive investigation protocol** – Triggers deeper searches when red flags emerge (married status, fake credentials, stolen photos)  
  
✅ **Screenshot analysis capability** – Extracts searchable information directly from dating app profiles

The stakes have never been higher. Let's explore why intelligent verification has become essential—and how the best AI tools are changing the game.

# Quick Answer: What Is the Best AI for Dating Background Investigation?

**The best AI for dating background investigation combines multi-platform search capabilities, intelligent language detection, and progressive investigation protocols to verify identity and authenticity across publicly available sources in minutes.** [**Dating Background Investigator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator) exemplifies this approach by conducting 16-26 targeted searches across social media, professional networks, and public records while automatically adapting to cultural context and language.

**Key capabilities of leading AI verification tools:**

* Multi-platform coverage (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok, Twitter/X, YouTube, Reddit, news archives)
* Automatic multi-lingual search execution based on name etymology and location
* Dating app screenshot analysis for extracting searchable information
* Progressive investigation triggered by high-signal findings (relationship status discrepancies, credential fraud, catfishing indicators)

# The Crisis: Why Traditional Background Checks Fail Online Daters

The online dating landscape has transformed dramatically, but safety measures haven't kept pace. [**76% of adults who have used dating apps**](https://www.security.org/digital-safety/scams/romance/) have experienced at least one form of online dating scam, from catfishing to financial fraud.

**The scale of the problem is staggering:**

* **Romance scam losses** – [**$1.14 billion lost in 2023**](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/02/love-stinks-when-scammer-involved), with median losses of $2,000 per victim (the highest for any imposter scam category)
* **Catfishing epidemic** – [**Nearly 59,000 Americans**](https://www.globaldatinginsights.com/featured/boomers-lose-the-most-as-romance-fraud-rises-across-the-u-s/) reported falling victim in 2024, with total losses reaching $697.3 million
* **Weekly suspicious encounters** – [**55% of current online daters**](https://newsroom.gendigital.com/2025-02-04-Romance-Reimagined-How-AI-is-Playing-Cupid-and-Catfish) encounter suspicious profiles at least weekly
* **AI-generated deception** – [**60% of online daters**](https://newsroom.gendigital.com/2025-02-04-Romance-Reimagined-How-AI-is-Playing-Cupid-and-Catfish) believe they've conversed with someone using AI to write messages

But here's what makes traditional verification nearly impossible for the average person:

# The Multi-Lingual Blind Spot

Someone with a Chinese, Spanish, or Arabic name likely maintains extensive online presence in their native language—social media posts, news mentions, professional profiles, and community discussions that never appear in English searches.

This linguistic barrier creates massive vulnerability. A person might appear to have minimal online footprint in English while maintaining active profiles in Mandarin, Spanish, or Arabic that reveal relationship status, professional inconsistencies, or other critical information.

# The Platform Privacy Maze



Instagram profiles default to private. Facebook limits non-friend visibility. LinkedIn shows limited information to non-connections. This fragmentation means even diligent manual research yields incomplete results.

According to [**Jumio's 2024 identity study**](https://www.jumio.com/2024-identity-study/), **68%** of consumers know or suspect they've been victims of online fraud or identity theft. Meanwhile, **72%** worry daily about being fooled by deepfakes—highlighting growing concerns about AI-generated fake identities.

# The Time and Expertise Barrier

Effective background research requires specific skills: knowing which platforms to search, how to formulate queries for different contexts, how to verify photo authenticity, how to cross-reference information across sources, and how to identify red flags. Most people lack this expertise and the 3-5 hours required to conduct thorough research.

[**48% of women**](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/02/02/key-findings-about-online-dating-in-the-u-s/) believe meeting someone from a dating app is unsafe—and they're right to be cautious without proper verification tools.

# What Makes AI-Powered Verification Superior

The best AI for dating background investigation doesn't just automate Google searches—it conducts the same systematic research a professional investigator would perform, but faster, more comprehensively, and with multi-lingual capabilities most individuals lack.

|Manual Verification|Best AI-Powered Tools|
|:-|:-|
|3-5 hours of scattered searching|2-5 minutes for comprehensive analysis|
|English-only searches miss native language content|Automatic searches in English + native languages|
|Limited by privacy settings and platform knowledge|Systematic coverage of all publicly accessible information|
|Inconsistent methodology, easy to miss platforms|Structured 16-26 query workflow across all major platforms|
|No expertise in red flag identification|Progressive investigation into high-signal findings|
|Results scattered across browser tabs|Organized, cited report with consistency analysis|

# Intelligent Multi-Platform Coverage

[The best AI tools](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator) search comprehensively across all major platforms where people maintain online identities:

**Social Media & Online Identity:**

* Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter/X
* YouTube channels and video appearances
* Reddit discussions and community participation
* Personal blogs and websites

**Professional & Educational Verification:**

* LinkedIn profiles and work history
* Company websites and professional directories
* Educational institution records
* Industry publications and achievements

**Public Presence & Reputation:**

* News mentions and media appearances
* Podcast interviews and public speaking
* Competition results and awards
* Community involvement and public records

**Relationship Status Indicators:**

* Public relationship status across platforms
* Social connections and tagged photos
* Dating app presence verification

# Automatic Cultural Intelligence

Unlike manual searches limited to English queries, [leading AI verification tools](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator) automatically infer a person's likely native language from name etymology, location, and cultural markers. They then execute parallel searches in **both English and native language** for comprehensive coverage.

For example, searching for someone with a Chinese name and Beijing location triggers simultaneous searches in English and Mandarin Chinese, uncovering:

* Chinese social media presence (Weibo, WeChat public posts)
* Chinese university records and alumni networks
* Chinese news archives and local media
* Chinese professional networks and industry forums

This multi-lingual approach reveals information that would remain completely hidden in English-only searches—often the difference between detecting deception and falling victim to it.

# Progressive Investigation Protocols

When [intelligent AI systems](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator) discover high-signal findings—information revealing significant hidden aspects of identity or raising authenticity concerns—they automatically conduct targeted follow-up searches:

**Triggers for deeper investigation:**

* Gender identity discoveries not disclosed on dating profile
* Married status while actively using dating apps
* Fake credentials or educational claims
* Catfishing indicators (photos stolen from other identities)
* Legal issues, scandals, or public controversies
* Significant inconsistencies across platforms

**Follow-up search process:**

1. Targeted 1-2 additional searches on specific discovery
2. Corroboration from independent sources
3. Current status and timeline verification
4. Maximum 3 follow-ups per finding to maintain efficiency

# How the Best AI Conducts Dating Background Investigation

[Dating Background Investigator AI](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator) follows a systematic research methodology designed to build a complete picture of someone's online identity while respecting privacy boundaries.

**Step 1: Information Gathering and Search Readiness Assessment**

Provide the person's identifying information through text description, dating app screenshot, or any combination of details. The AI evaluates whether it has sufficient information to identify a specific individual.

**Sufficient information examples:**

* Dating app screenshot with name, location, occupation, and photos
* Name + current employer + city
* Name + LinkedIn URL
* Name + university + location + age range

If information is insufficient, the AI requests narrowing details: current city, occupation/employer, school attended, social media handles, age range, or unique identifiers.

**Step 2: Multi-Cultural Context and Language Determination**

Based on name etymology, location, and available context, the AI determines the person's likely cultural background and native language. This informs search strategy—queries will be executed in both English and the identified native language for comprehensive coverage.

**Step 3: Phase 1 Verification (2-4 queries)**

Initial verification queries confirm the AI can identify the specific individual and isn't returning results for multiple different people with the same name.

Example verification queries:

* `""John Smith"" software engineer Seattle`
* `""John Smith"" University of Washington 2018`

If results show many distinct individuals, the AI requests additional narrowing details. If results confirm a specific person, it proceeds to comprehensive search.

**Step 4: Phase 2 Comprehensive Multi-Dimensional Search (14-20 queries)**

The AI executes a structured search workflow covering all major platforms and information types:

**Social Media & Online Identity (5-7 queries):**

* Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter/X presence
* YouTube channels and video appearances
* Broad web presence sweep
* Platform-specific searches for common names

**Professional & Educational Background (3-4 queries):**

* LinkedIn profile and work history
* Company affiliation verification
* Educational institution records

**Public Presence & Reputation (3-4 queries):**

* News mentions and media coverage
* Interviews, podcasts, public speaking
* Reddit discussions and community participation
* Personal blogs or websites

**Historical & Deep Discovery (2-3 queries):**

* Specific interests or hobbies mentioned in profile
* Competitions, awards, events, achievements
* Native language searches for international subjects

**Relationship Status & Social Verification (2-3 queries):**

* Public relationship status indicators
* Dating app presence across platforms

**Online Reputation & Safety (2-3 queries when context warrants):**

* Scam, fraud, or complaint mentions
* Controversies or scandals
* Safety warnings or cautions

All searches are conducted in both English and the subject's native language when applicable.

**Step 5: Progressive Investigation (Additional 2-6 queries if triggered)**

When high-signal findings emerge—information revealing significant hidden aspects of identity or raising authenticity concerns—the AI conducts targeted follow-up searches:

* 1-2 additional searches on specific discovery
* Independent source corroboration
* Current status verification
* Maximum 3 follow-ups per finding

**Step 6: Comprehensive Identity Report Generation**

[The AI](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator) synthesizes all findings into an organized, cited report structured by relevance and significance:

**Report components:**

* **Identity Consistency Analysis** – Photos, name, age, location, occupation alignment across platforms; discrepancies noted
* **Social Media Presence** – Active platforms, activity level, public vs. private profiles, photo styles, social connections
* **Professional Background** – Current employer, role, work history, education verification
* **Comprehensive Life Picture** – Hobbies, interests, community involvement, historical activities, unique discoveries
* **Relationship Status** – Current status if discoverable, public relationship history
* **Public Reputation** – News mentions, community discussions, online presence patterns
* **Historical Discoveries** – Past activities, posts, affiliations, name changes, significant life events
* **Authenticity Indicators** – Verified credentials, consistent long-term presence, genuine social connections vs. red flags
* **Access Limitations** – What couldn't be accessed due to privacy settings or platform restrictions

Every claim includes clickable source citations with URLs and dates when available.

**Step 7: Identity Assessment and Limitations Disclosure**

The report concludes with a brief synthesis (4-6 sentences) addressing:

* Identity consistency across platforms
* Comprehensive life picture that emerged
* Most significant discoveries
* Information limitations and what couldn't be verified

The AI maintains epistemic humility—acknowledging that it can only access publicly visible web content, and many platforms restrict full visibility to non-friends or non-connections.

# Real-World Success Stories: When the Best AI Saves the Day

Over **12,000 people** have used [Dating Background Investigator AI](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator) to verify potential partners before meeting, preventing financial losses, emotional harm, and dangerous situations. Here are representative scenarios showing how intelligent verification protects users.

# 📱 Mobile Quick Verification Success

**Scenario:** Sarah matches with someone on Hinge, exchanges messages for a week, and wants basic verification before their coffee date.

**Traditional Approach:** Manual Google searches, checking Instagram/Facebook (often private), maybe LinkedIn—taking 45 minutes and yielding minimal results due to privacy settings.

[**Dating Background Investigator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator)**:** Sarah uploads the Hinge profile screenshot. Within 3 minutes, she receives a comprehensive report showing:

* Instagram profile (public) with 300+ posts confirming photos match dating profile
* LinkedIn profile confirming claimed occupation at tech startup
* Facebook profile (limited visibility) showing relationship status as ""Single""
* YouTube channel with 8 videos from past year showing same person
* No concerning findings in news or public records

**Outcome:** Sarah meets her match with confidence, knowing photos are authentic, basic claims verified, and no red flags detected. They're now in a committed relationship six months later.

# 💼 Professional Credential Verification

**Scenario:** Michael has been talking to someone for three weeks who claims to be a surgeon at a prestigious hospital. Before getting emotionally invested, he wants to verify professional credentials.

**Traditional Approach:** Searching hospital staff directories, medical board databases, LinkedIn—time-consuming and often inconclusive without specific details.

[**Dating Background Investigator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator)**:** Conducts targeted professional verification searches revealing:

* LinkedIn profile confirming medical degree from claimed university
* Hospital staff directory listing confirming current employment
* Medical board license verification (public record)
* News article from two years ago about community health initiative
* Professional association memberships
* No discrepancies between claimed credentials and verified information

**Outcome:** Michael proceeds with confidence, knowing his match's professional claims are legitimate. They're now planning to meet families after four months of dating.

# 🌍 International Multi-Lingual Discovery

**Scenario:** Emma meets someone from Brazil on an international dating app. Person has limited English social media presence but claims to be a successful entrepreneur.

**Traditional Approach:** English-only searches yield almost nothing—person appears to have minimal online presence, raising suspicion.

[**Dating Background Investigator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator)**:** Executes parallel searches in English and Portuguese, uncovering:

* Extensive Instagram presence with 8,000+ followers (Portuguese content)
* Brazilian business news articles about person's startup (4 articles over 3 years)
* Brazilian university alumni network profile confirming education
* LinkedIn profile with English and Portuguese information
* Local business directory entries confirming company registration
* Photos across platforms consistent with dating profile

**Outcome:** Emma's concerns evaporate—the minimal English presence was simply linguistic, not suspicious. The person's claims are verified through Portuguese sources. They're now in a long-distance relationship with plans to meet in person.

# 🚨 Red Flag Discovery Prevents Financial Loss

**Scenario:** David has been talking to someone for six weeks and is considering a serious relationship. He wants thorough verification before deeper commitment.

**Traditional Approach:** Surface-level searches might miss concerning information buried in older posts or less-visible platforms.

[**Dating Background Investigator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator)**:** Comprehensive search reveals high-signal finding—person's Facebook profile (limited visibility but some posts public) shows relationship status as ""Married"" despite claiming to be single on dating app. AI triggers progressive investigation:

**Follow-up searches:**

1. `""[Name]"" married OR wife OR spouse` – Finds wedding announcement from 18 months ago in local newspaper
2. `""[Name]"" [Spouse Name]` – Finds joint social media posts from 3 months ago
3. `""[Name]"" divorce OR separated` – No results indicating divorce or separation

**Report conclusion:** Person is currently married based on multiple corroborating sources (Facebook status, wedding announcement, recent joint posts with spouse), with no evidence of divorce or separation. This directly contradicts dating profile claim of being single.

**Outcome:** David avoids emotional investment in someone who was deceiving him. He later learned the person had scammed three other people he matched with. The verification saved him from potential financial loss and emotional trauma.

# 📊 Catfishing Detection Saves User from Scam

**Scenario:** Lisa matches with someone whose photos seem professionally shot and profile seems ""too perfect."" She wants to verify photos are authentic.

**Traditional Approach:** Reverse image search on Google—but this only works if exact photos have been used elsewhere, missing cases where photos are stolen but slightly edited.

[**Dating Background Investigator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator)**:** Multi-platform search reveals:

* No social media profiles found matching the name and location
* Reverse image search shows photos appear on a modeling portfolio website under different name
* No professional background verification possible (claimed employer has no record)
* No historical online presence (no old posts, no digital footprint)
* Reddit discussions mention similar profile using same photos on different dating apps

**Report conclusion:** Strong indicators of catfishing—photos appear to be stolen from modeling portfolio, no verifiable online identity exists for claimed name, and similar profiles reported on other platforms.

**Outcome:** Lisa blocks and reports the profile, avoiding potential romance scam. She later learned the FBI was investigating a network using these exact photos to defraud victims of over $500,000.

They automatically identify high-signal findings requiring deeper investigation and synthesize scattered information into an organized, cited report—all in 2-5 minutes versus 3-5 hours of manual research.

# Can AI access private social media profiles?

No. [Dating Background Investigator AI](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator) can only access publicly visible information on the web. Many platforms restrict full access to non-friends or non-connections. The tool explicitly notes access limitations in its reports and frames findings as ""what was found in publicly accessible sources"" rather than comprehensive verification.

# Does the best AI for dating background investigation work on mobile?

Yes. Jenova supports both [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/jenova/id6747692301) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.jenova.app.prod) apps with full feature parity. You can upload dating app screenshots, conduct searches, and receive comprehensive reports directly on your phone.

# How accurate is AI-powered identity verification?

The best AI tools achieve high accuracy by cross-referencing multiple independent sources and explicitly citing each finding with URLs. However, accuracy depends on the availability of publicly accessible information. [Dating Background Investigator AI](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator) transparently discloses what it could and couldn't verify, maintaining epistemic humility about limitations.

# Is using AI for background checks ethical?

[Dating Background Investigator AI](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator) only searches publicly available information—the same information anyone could find through manual research, just more efficiently and comprehensively. Given that [**$1.14 billion was lost to romance scams in 2023**](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/02/love-stinks-when-scammer-involved) and [**nearly 59,000 Americans were catfishing victims in 2024**](https://www.globaldatinginsights.com/featured/boomers-lose-the-most-as-romance-fraud-rises-across-the-u-s/), verifying basic identity and authenticity before meeting someone from a dating app is a reasonable safety precaution.

# Conclusion: Choose the Best AI to Protect Your Heart and Wallet

The transformation of dating from in-person introductions to digital-first connections has created unprecedented opportunities—and unprecedented risks. With [**60.5 million Americans**](https://www.statista.com/topics/2158/online-dating/) using online dating services and [**$1.14 billion lost annually**](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/02/love-stinks-when-scammer-involved) to romance scams, intelligent verification has become essential, not optional.

The best AI for dating background investigation doesn't just automate Google searches—it conducts systematic, multi-lingual research across social media, professional networks, and public records, transforming hours of manual searching into minutes of comprehensive verification with full source citations.

Whether you're verifying basic identity consistency before a first date, checking professional credentials before deeper emotional investment, or conducting thorough research before a serious relationship commitment, [**Dating Background Investigator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator) provides evidence-based insights that protect both your heart and your wallet.

Hey Maximizame fam! 👋

Ever feel like you're just going through the motions, wishing for that extra spark of joy or a noticeable boost in your progress? I've been there, and honestly, it can be a bit disheartening. We're all here trying to level up, right? But sometimes, the ""massive impact"" part feels like a distant dream, and the ""simple shifts"" get lost in the noise.

What if I told you it’s not about grand, overnight transformations? It's about those tiny, almost imperceptible tweaks that, over time, compound into something truly game-changing. Think of it like a well-tuned engine – small adjustments make a world of difference to its performance.

Let's explore some of those simple shifts that can unlock a whole new level of optimization and, more importantly, genuine joy in our lives.

*   **The Power of the Pause:** We're constantly bombarded with information and demands. Taking just a few minutes each day to *intentionally* pause – no phone, no tasks, just breathe – can reset your nervous system and offer clarity. It's in these quiet moments that brilliant ideas and solutions often surface.

*   **Micro-Moments of Gratitude:** It sounds cliché, I know. But actively noticing and appreciating the small good things – a warm cup of coffee, a friendly interaction, a beautiful sunset – can rewire your brain for positivity. It's not about ignoring challenges, but about balancing your perspective.

*   **The ""One Thing"" Rule (for *one* area):** Trying to optimize everything at once is a recipe for burnout. Pick *one* area of your life that feels a little off-kilter and focus on just one small, consistent improvement there for a week. Maybe it's drinking an extra glass of water, or getting 15 minutes of sunlight. See what happens.

*   **Embrace Imperfection (seriously!):** Striving for perfection can paralyze us. What if we aimed for ""good enough"" and then iterated? This mindset shift can free up so much mental energy and allow us to actually *do* more.

*   **Connect with Your ""Why"":** When things get tough, remembering your deeper purpose can be the fuel you need. It doesn't have to be world-changing; it could be about being a better friend, creating something beautiful, or simply living a life aligned with your values.

Sometimes, navigating our emotional landscape can be a significant hurdle in our optimization journey. If you're finding yourself struggling with overwhelming emotions or need a supportive space to process things, I've found **this resource (affiliate link)** to be incredibly helpful. It offers practical tools and guidance that can make a real difference.

1pldjvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1pldjvd/water_gives_me_such_bad_gas_and_chest_pain_whats/,Water gives me such bad gas and chest pain.  What's left that I can drink?!,"Water gives me that awful gas pressure that feels like a heart attack and lasts for hours.  Despite all the foods that exist in the world, plain water is my worst trigger.  I don't know if it's mineral content or what.  I realize swallowing air can be a thing and I'm probably doing that, but if so, how do I stop??  (I don't use straws.)

The other problem is, I'm kind of running out of things I can drink.

Sodas and seltzers are out.  They just double the bloat/gas.

Most fruit juices give me day-ruining diarrhea.  (Some people need prune juice.  Lucky me, I can clear myself out with anything you've got!)

Coffee and iced tea are out; can't have caffeine.

Hot teas bloat me out like nobody's business.  

Gatorade is okay but it's basically just melted popsicles with salt added.  I can't have that with every meal.  

Lemonade and my one ok juice (cranberry) are out because lately I can't handle anything remotely acidic without serious pain.  (Please let this pass soon, I miss tomatoes so badly.)

Dairy milk has a 50/50 shot of giving me nausea.  Plant milks taste awful to me.  Milk doesn't really make me less thirsty.  And drinking milk with dinner as a 40something adult makes me feel like a weirdo. 

Kefir is okay but that's not really a beverage.  Mostly I drink it in hopes of establishing some kind of decent gut health.  Hasn't happened yet but here's hoping.  



I've only been drinking water and the occasional Gatorade for years.  And it was fine.  Yeah, this would happen now and then, but now it's constant.

I have managed not to buy any more cigarettes since October last year! 

I am still vaping, and I know that's not a popular thing on this sub and it genuinely could be the wrong choice for many. I am lucky enough that for me, I have genuinely severly cut down on my spending and nicotine consumption since making the switch. By my calculations I've saved around USD 200; not the biggest deal but it's a fun thing to keep track off that helps me maintain my resolve.

*Things that help:*

-- I've stuck to my rule of not vaping where I wouldn't smoke, so I vape like 5-15 times a day in the outdoors

-- I don't feel compelled to finish a stick so sometimes I stop at just a few puffs

-- I use a low nicotine concentration

-- I've gotten into coffee so in the morning instead of being desperate for my first smoke, I make espresso instead. Ngl there are bad days when I seem to vape nonstop, but I would honestly say that there are much more days when I don't need to vape until after lunch



*Things that don't help:*

-- When I join friends on smoking breaks and someone has the exact brand and kind of cigarette that used to be my favorite, I fold... I have smoked exactly nine sticks since Quitting Day on Oct 2024

-- I can't break the habit of needing to smoke after meals 😅 I usually skip breakfast or else am running late, but deadass how will I ever quit vaping if immediately after eating a meal, my instinct is to go out and puff in peace

-- My partner both vapes and smokes, though leaning more towards cigarettes still sadly


So... that is it. Hope to stay the course (and maybe even quit vaping altogether!) in the coming year. See y'all in 2026 💪",4,1765603302.0,stopsmoking,0,1.0,False

1pld4h6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amazontly/comments/1pld4h6/what_are_the_different_types_of_digital_kitchen/,What are the different types of digital kitchen scale?,"When you're looking to level up your cooking game, understanding the different types of digital kitchen scales can make a huge difference. These handy tools help you measure ingredients accurately, whether you're baking bread or portioning out meals.

**Compact Digital Scales**

These are the most common types you'll find in kitchens. They're small, lightweight, and perfect for everyday cooking. You can measure flour, sugar, butter, and other ingredients with precision. Most compact scales handle weights up to 11 pounds, which works great for regular recipes.

**High-Capacity Kitchen Scales**

If you cook in larger batches or need to weigh bigger items, high-capacity scales are your best bet. These can handle anywhere from 15 to 25 pounds. They're ideal for weighing whole chickens, large cuts of meat, or when you're meal prepping for the week.

**Nutritional Scales**

These specialized scales go beyond basic weighing. They calculate calories, carbs, protein, and fat content based on what you're measuring. If you're tracking macros or watching your diet, nutritional scales save you tons of time.

**Pocket Scales**

Super portable and precise, pocket scales are tiny but mighty. They measure small amounts with incredible accuracy, often down to 0.01 grams. Coffee enthusiasts and spice lovers appreciate these for measuring exact quantities.

**Smart Kitchen Scales**

The newest addition to the family connects to your phone via Bluetooth. Smart scales sync with recipe apps and help you follow instructions step-by-step. They're becoming more popular as people look for ways to make cooking easier.

When you're ready to find the perfect scale for your needs, you can check out various options at [this collection of digital kitchen scales](https://athomewave.com/digital-kitchen-scale). Each type serves different purposes, so think about what you'll use it for most often.

**What to Look For**

No matter which type you choose, certain features matter across the board. Look for scales with a tare function, which lets you zero out the weight of your bowl or container. An easy-to-read display is essential, especially when you're in the middle of cooking. Battery life and auto-shutoff features also help your scale last longer.

Most digital kitchen scales use either grams or ounces, and many let you switch between units. This flexibility comes in handy when you're following recipes from different countries or sources.

The best part? You don't need to spend a fortune to get a quality scale. Whether you pick a basic model or something more advanced, accurate measurements will improve your cooking results. If you want to browse through different styles and price ranges, [you can explore your options here](https://athomewave.com/digital-kitchen-scale).

Getting the right digital kitchen scale depends on your cooking style and what you make most often. Once you start using one regularly, you'll wonder how you ever cooked without it.",1,1765601894.0,Amazontly,0,1.0,False

1pld1dg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nirvana/comments/1pld1dg/live_and_loud_soundcheck_excerpt_from_american/,Live and Loud Soundcheck + Excerpt from American Junkie,"December 13, 1993

This my long personal narrative with excerpts from Tom Hansen's book American Junkie weaved throughout about the final time both of us saw Nirvana live. It was on this date 32 years ago when they were rehearsing/playing the MTV Live and Loud show, which was later broadcast nationally on New Years Eve. My coworkers and I were setting up the coffee brewers in the concession stand while they were practicing that afternoon, and I was awestruck at the full throated concert-like intensity, even though there were just a few other video production people and various vendors setting up their stands.

My co-worker Craig and I had finished installing the large catering coffee brewers and were calibrating the temperature and water levels. Dave Bach another buddy from work was supposed to help, but he was more interested getting free food from the Frito-Lay stand and checking out the band. It was strange to see them playing to an empty floor and from so far away. With the exception of the 92 Coliseum concert, I would always be right at the stage, in the pit whenever I saw them live. I probably saw less than an hour of their warm up that day, and In hindsight, I wish I had spent more time listening and soaking it all in, and less time worrying about a few degrees of hot water. Dave had driven separately and told us that when he was driving north on Alaskan Way, he stopped and saw Kurt walking in front of him across the street and gave him the peace sign. According to Dave, Kurt gave him a quick smile and waved back.

........
(from American Junkie, published 2010) - Tom Hansen had had been with Kurt and Dylan Carlson in a car parked under the viaduct a few minutes before Dave saw them crossing the street. ""They got into the car, Kurt in front. He was wearing a plaid coat and ripped jeans, his hair was greasy and he had big sunglasses on. I hadn’t seen him for a while, and asked him how he was doing. He looked tired, and mumbled something about those fuckers in New York, then looked at me for a second, smiled a bit, and then stared out the window.

""I handed Kurt a piece of heroin and he handed me some money. It was a shame that the only times we met were under these conditions. I didn’t feel much solidarity for most people, even junkies, but I had the feeling we could have been friends given half a chance. The times we’d met before, in a hotel or one of his houses, he’d often sit and talk to me, most of the time about nothing, but obviously trying to keep the conversation going as if he didn’t want me to leave, like it was an immense relief for him to just sit and talk with someone who didn’t want something from him. It was very strange, he was one of the most visible people on Earth and I was the most invisible, and yet I had something he needed. Sometimes, I had to awkwardly tell him I had to go, and then extract myself.

""The sun was setting over the Sound, and people had started gathering on the pier. Kurt’s face was kind of haunted, but he managed a smile. Then he broke my gaze and stared out the window again. Dylan and I finished doing a deal, and Kurt handed me a backstage pass to the show that night, something MTV was filming called Live and Loud. He extracted his lanky body out of the car, and flipped up the back seat. Dylan climbed out, shut the door, leaned in the window, “You should come back down for the show,” he said. I told him I probably would. They would probably want more heroin by then anyway. Kurt hunched up his coat, like a turtle retreating into his shell. They waved, and walked back across Alaskan Way, disappearing into the glare."" (American Junkie, Tom Hansen, published 2010)

........
Later that afternoon, I went back to the Starbucks building. The little office I worked out of had been given a dozen passes and I had one in my hand. The admin and professional sales team knew they were a popular band, but a few couldn't name even one song Nirvana did. They did talk about which restaurant they were going to have dinner and cocktails at beforehand. Not sure if I viewed Nirvana differently because they were now an established band, but for reasons I'm still unsure of today, I passed my pass onto an older coworker in her 30s. She had mentioned she used rock out before she got married, but hadn't gone to a concert in years. The next time I saw her, she was raving about their performance and asked to make copies of my Nirvana studio and boots afterward. No clue what I ended up doing that night, but certainly wasn't as memorable as seeing them at one of their last local shows.

.......
Meanwhile, Tom decided to go see the show. ""Nirvana eventually started playing and I wandered out front, then through the crowd to the back of the hall. Pat Smear, the old guitar player from The Germs was playing with them. I listened for a few songs, hoping they would play Something In The Way. That had always been my favorite Nirvana song. Something in the way…mmhh…hmmm, Something in the way, yeah…mmhh…hmmm. There was definitely something in my way. Probably me. Shouting into Dylan’s ear, I told him I was leaving. There wasn’t any point in staying, this wasn’t my world anymore. It probably never had been. As I walked out I looked up at Kurt, on stage. It would be the last time I saw him. In a few months he would be dead."" (excerpts with permission from American Junkie, published 2010, author Tom Hansen) Tom himself passed away August 2023.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

1plcuqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1plcuqe/i_35f_had_a_falling_out_with_my_neighbor_33m_over/,I [35F] had a falling out with my neighbor [33M] over my coworker [27F],"2025 was the year of change: I discovered my husband had been cheating on me, I got divorced, moved to a new city, and started a new job. I'd been trying to make a new friend group, which is how I met my neighbor (I'll call him Josh). He's super extroverted, constantly has people at his house, etc. It was nice to be included. Around the same time, I became friends with a woman at my new work (I'll call her Claire).

Josh and I became really close really quickly, but I was upfront with him that I wasn't ready to date anyone. Josh agreed that he, too, wasn't interested in dating anyone due to finding out his father had been cheating on his mother for most of his life. We bonded over our hatred of cheaters.

Claire and I joked about how attractive Josh was and I had joked that it would be funny if her and Josh dated. This was a joke specifically because Claire was in a committed relationship--she told me on numerous occasions about how great her boyfriend Steve is, how they had a great sex life, how they had met each other's families, and how they were with each other constantly outside of work. However, I also knew that Steve is at least the 3rd person she's dated/been sleeping with regularly just this year. Claire is much more focused on getting married than on having a career. Josh and I met Claire and Steve for drinks at one point, and afterward I mentioned to Josh that Claire is a bit of a mess when it comes to relationships.

As soon as Claire met Josh, she decided she wanted to date him and dump Steve. She was constantly asking what Josh was doing, what he was up to, if I'd talked to him. I thought it was a little gross because she was still dating Steve. I mentioned this to Josh and he told me that he didn't have an interest in dating Claire if she was willing to throw away Steve so easily. Then Claire started finding all kinds of issues with Steve--he's too needy, he surprised me with Starbucks when I asked him to make me coffee, he is too attached to his nephew (yes, these are real complaints she had). One night she comes to my house and tells me she told Steve she wanted them to go on a break for a couple weeks and told him not to talk to her; then she makes an excuse for both of us to go speak with Josh. While we are speaking with Josh, Josh makes a joke about Steve, and Claire immediately states that her and Steve broke up. I feel like I'm caught in the crossfire here, but I don't want to confront Claire about her relationship in front of Josh, so I don't say anything right then. However, even though Claire and Steve are on a 'break', Steve is still coming to her house and they are still having sex.

Claire goes on vacation for a week with her family; her 'break' from Steve is supposed to be over when she returns and Steve is making plans of things they'll do when she's back. I see Josh a few times. Josh tells me Claire is his type. I repeat to him that Claire is really messy when it comes to relationships but that he is a grown man and he can do whatever he wants to do. I do NOT tell him the truth: that Claire is actually still seeing Steve and that Steve fully believes they will get back together when she returns from her vacation.

The day Claire gets back from vacation, her and Josh start sexting and having phone sex. Steve still thinks him and Claire are getting back together, so he is doing all sorts of nice things for Claire. Suddenly I realize Josh is relaying messages from Claire to me and now Josh is prioritizing hanging out with Claire over plans out with me. I think through it and realize I am:

1. Not okay with the fact that Josh, who obviously knows that cheating is what destroyed my marriage and who has sworn to me that cheaters are the scum of the earth, is now in effect helping Claire cheat on Steve,
2. Not okay with the fact that Josh is prioritizing Claire (who he had met twice) over me (who he had been friends with for several months), and
3. I don't feel comfortable lying to Josh about Claire's actual relationship status, and I don't want to be in a situation where I am forced to lie about it.

I realize that what Claire is doing is shitty, but I had also warned Josh that Claire is messy in relationships and he chose not to listen. I text Josh that I think our friendship has run its course and its best we go our separate ways. In the text message I say that my friendship with Claire takes priority. Josh is hurt but says okay.

I speak with Claire and she says that Josh has stopped talking to her because he is so upset about me ending our friendship. She asks me to tell Josh that it isn't Claire's fault. I ask Josh to talk and he says no. I shrug my shoulders and move on with my life.

That was six weeks ago. Since then, Claire has gradually stopped speaking to me entirely. We used to get coffee several times a week, meet up for happy hours, text daily, everything. Now she doesn't respond to my text messages for days, says she's too busy to meet up, and so on. She has also started lying to me: she was going to take my dog with her over Thanksgiving weekend (Wednesday-Sunday) when she went to see her family. On Wednesday--after I'd already left town--she texts and says actually she's going to stay in town, do a 5k with Josh, and then go see her family on Friday, so can she drop my dog off before she leaves on Friday. I thankfully was able to find another dog sitter; however, I got back very early Saturday morning and saw her car in front of Josh's house on both Saturday and Sunday. She didn't go see her family at all, she just backed out of our agreement.

I've tried to be friendly and have invited her out a couple times; every time she says she's busy, but then I see her car at Josh's house. At one point I asked her if she was going to tell Josh about Steve and she said ""why would I?"". I replied that if Josh knew the truth he would be pissed. Claire didn't respond to me.

It is now clear to me that Claire is no longer my friend. But I also gave up my friendship with Josh to protect Claire's secret. It feels pretty shitty walking past Josh's house and seeing Claire's car knowing that Claire lied/is still lying to everyone. Do I tell Josh the truth or just let it be?",3,1765601012.0,relationship_advice,7,0.6,False
1plcugp,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1plcugp/44_m_leeds_uk_looking_for_a_connection_that/,44 M Leeds UK - Looking for a connection that starts with banter and ends with “how is it 2am already?”,"So… apparently making friends (or more 👀) after 40 involves actually talking to people, so here I am doing exactly that.

I’m a 44-year-old guy from Leeds — equal parts DIY enthusiast and “I’ll just watch one more episode” optimist. You’ll find me running to justify my love of baking, planning trips I probably should’ve booked already, getting lost in a good book, or arguing internally over whether to replay an old game or finally start a new one.

Strengths include: 
• Fixing things around the house
• Baking something impressive on occasion
• Remembering movie quotes no one asked for

Weaknesses include: 
• Thinking I can still pull an all-nighter
• Buying games faster than I finish them
• Letting banter escalate unnecessarily 😌

Ideally, you’re someone who enjoys good conversation and isn’t afraid of a little sarcasm. Bonus points if you can recommend a book, a travel destination, or a film that emotionally wrecked you (in a good way).

If this made you smile even slightly, say hi.
Worst case? We exchange a few messages and go on with our lives.
Best case? We accidentally become each other’s favourite notification.

So… tea or coffee? 🍵☕️

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

I also have been seeing a lot of couples in real life and social media who obviously really like each other and it makes me upset. We aren’t cute together from my perspective. We’re opposites, which is nice sometimes but other times irritates the crap out of me. Couples are lovey and touchy and hold hands. His hands are dry. He thinks I don’t like pda even though I have told him I do just not excessive. His idea is that pda is like touching my butt or my boobs or something and I hate that of COURSE who WOULDN’T? A little butt tap is fiiine but you don’t have to grope me in public. All I want is kisses, little hugs, an arm around me, hand holding, something to show me he is thinking about me when I’m around. I give him back scratches, neck scratches, little hugs, butt taps, just any physical touch I can and he enjoys it but why doesn’t he reciprocate?

He gets really critical of me and is always telling me to fix my problems like today, he drove up to pick me up because he dropped me off and picked up the car because it’s cold out (something he usually does and I appreciate it). But then he sits out there honking and I literally could not see the car because it’s a dark vehicle, it was night time, and the windows/doors are dirty on the store. So I couldn’t see and didn’t realize the honking was him. USUALLY he will call or text me and when I got in he was mad that I made him wait there. I explained the problem and he said basically “just fix it. Whatever you have to do, figure it out.”

When we were engaged he was mad that other people got to see my dress before him. I did a boudoir photoshoot beforehand and he was mad about that. He was massively upset out of “concern” because he didn’t trust the lady who took the pictures not the post them on her site. 

He hates morning and is crabby every morning. He gets short with me when we have plans because he gets stressed (in my opinion but I don’t actually know the reason). He gets mad that I don’t wake up before him in the morning and says usually something along the lines of “if you’re a morning person then you should get up, you like mornings, make your coffee, read, do something but don’t just lay in bed” I AM  a morning person and he repeatedly insists I am not when the reason I’m tired in the morning is because he stays up really late and if I want to spend time with him, that’s the only time to do it.  

He doesn’t initiate sex because he thinks I don’t want it, and no matter how many signals I explain like “every time I wear cute ‘pjs’ Imm ready to go” but he doesn’t even ask and says I have rejected him too many times so he doesn’t want to ask anymore. When in reality I have rejected him maybe three times our entire marriage and they were for different reasons probably every time. He has blown me off way more than 3. He just doesn’t interact. I am just so mad! It’s like the only things I care about he doesn’t do, and he does stuff like open my doors, pick up the car, and let me have the last bite which is NICE don’t get me wrong, I know a lot of guys won’t even do those things. I appreciate him, I love him, we have good conversations and get along fine usually. But damn sometimes I want to just run off and never come back. He makes me so mad and seems to live in a completely different reality from me. Our most common argument is what we did or did not say. He will insist, I will insist, and we get nowhere. Right now I’m mad because he just doesn’t speak to me kindly when he’s stressed about stuff. We are having mixed group party and I wanted to do a craft that required people to brung something, and I wanted to come up with conversation topics about specific people for introductions to break the ice. Well he didn’t tell anyone about the craft until this evening and the party is tomorrow so if anyone had to go to the store they’re SOL. And he only came up with stupid, made up topics like a friend paid for sex, then immediately changed the subject to talk about something else totally unrelated to the topic or party. Then he got in me about how I was organizing some things, how I did the laundry, where I put water jugs, how I turned on the humidifier. It just doesn’t end. I feel like HE is the one who nags. 

He doesn’t try for me either! He doesn’t eat well or exercise so he’s gained probably like 60-70lbs since we’ve been married (3 years) and he doesn’t care at all. I still love him, and would stick with him regardless. But I tryyyy! I work out, I try to eat well, I dress well, I try to look cute for him and he doesn’t even remotely care but seems to find lots if things about me to pick at or criticize. 

He does other things well but this is a rant post so I an definitely focusing heavily on the bad annoying bits, not so much the positive things (which there is plenty of too).

She (43f) and I (22f) really hit off as she was a “baby gay” and I had been an out and proud lesbian for over a decade at this point.

Small things, us staying too close to one another, hugs that were more frequent and lingered longer than they should. We get along very well and have developed what I would say is a nice friendship.)

So fast forward to two days ago, she and I met  for coffee. During this event she asked me if I ever considered dating her. I told her, that I figured she was off limits and I hadn’t really let myself ponder the idea. In the back of my head I was thinking about how I’ve totally thought about it but figured I would never go for as when I met her she was married to my mothers best friend and is now his ex wife and for a brief period of time she was considered “family” while with him. We talked about it and I said I wasn’t opposed to us trying things however I worry about what this could potentially do to the relationship I have with my mothers best friend, his relationship with my family and so much more.

About a month into working there my other coworker Chad  [18M] warned me that when Jake gets drunk he like texts some weird things and that I should just ignore it. That night Jake texted me asking me out and I assumed he was drunk so I only half swiped the message and never responded and in the morning the message was gone. During my next shift about 5 days later (I only work weekends because of school and sports)Chad confesses that Jake had told our other coworker Emma [17f] that Jake had confessed he had feelings for me but also confessed his feeling for her, which she turned down and that he was very upset at the fact I had ignored his message. I was very confused because I felt like I had never gave him any reason to like me and I had just kind of treated him like everyone else. Chad told me to keep it to myself because if everyone else found out it would get blown out of proportion and our manager and his mom who workers there would make a bigger deal about it than it actually is. In addition he also said that Jake couldn’t stop thinking about what he told Emma and felt bad for confessing to her and that if I told anyone else who works there that his work performance would deteriorate and he could possibly get fired. Part of me feels bad because he probably needs the money more than I do but at the same time I am really upset because he has said before that he just wants a fling to sleep with and that means he views me in the same way which makes me upset. I don’t reciprocate feelings or anything but am I overreacting is this really not that big of a deal like Chad said?

just a warning: small mentions of alcohol, weed, nicotine, paranoia.

i have ocd and it’s more so just intrusive thoughts + a lot of anxiety/paranoia.

so last year during my junior year of highschool, i believe i was under a lot of stress and anxiety from school. taking 4 aps, my sat and act, extracurriculars, etc. but honestly, i loved my friends and life, but was just under a lot of what i think was “manageable” stress.

i wasn’t in a dark place at all, but i did notice i was just more.. outwardly stressed, not really letting it get to me personally yk? 

over the summer junior—>senior year, i drank some alcohol w my friends, stayed up pretty late and got little sleep, and the next day, had a movie night where i got a coffee at around 4 pm. plus, i had casually vaped nicotine all throughout.

it hits 6pm and i suddenly get thrown into a weird dissociative episode. i couldn’t stop crying for no reason, i felt disconnected to my body and all of a sudden REALLY anxious and paranoid. for ex, i was staying home alone that night and was terrified someone was going to break in, so i had to call my friends to stay over with me. i also took melatonin to help me fall asleep and hopefully get over it, but was so worried that it was some other drug. (bizarre stuff) 

i can’t really describe the feeling—it was like i was high on weed kind of. i was felt disconnected, like a buzzing sensation was coming and going over me, like noise was blocked off, and just super anxious/paranoid.

after that, i started seeing a therapist, and it helped, but ever since then, ive become a lot more anxious/paranoid in day to day life. i also can’t make out if im still dissociating—i don’t really know what the feeling of not dissociating feels like anymore, yk? 

i honestly still don’t know what happened. i summed it up as like my stress from previous months was suddenly dumped on me when i had a trigger of alcohol+nosleep+nicotine+caffeine. have any of you experienced something similar, or what do you think this could’ve been? 

it’s an isolated incident, so not looking for a diagnosis or anything, just has anyone who has defined a similar experience? ",1,1765600274.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

J1 is a huge US based bank. J2 I don't have yet... I'm in late stages of interviews. J2 is a much smaller (but still big) bank. I anticipate J2 will make an offer soon. 

Both have on site requirements. J1 is 3 days in the office, J2 is 2 days.

It's a big step up and I'm actually pretty excited about the position.

If both jobs were remote I wouldn't hesitate about OE at all. But logging in to J1 while on site at J2 might be difficult technically. I'm most concerned with my boss looking for me at J1 for an impromptu meeting and bullshit session. He does this maybe once a month.

1plcgvh,https://i.redd.it/6clf3ftkew6g1.jpeg,What is the best way to remove this stain?,"Hello everyone, looking for advice on how to best clean this oil stain off my varnished mdf coffee table. I love this table and it is only a few months old, amazon doesn’t sell them any more. For context the stain is a little over 24 hours old, and it is from a salad dressing that sat overnight (didn’t see the drip). I have already tried putting baking soda on it and letting it sit for 8 hours but it hasn’t touched the stain, not sure if there is anything I can try next?",3,1765599762.0,CleaningTips,4,1.0,False

1plcgi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1plcgi5/vs_mani_coffee_decoction_pretty_bad_honestly/,"VS Mani coffee decoction: Pretty bad, honestly","I ordered some of that VS Mani coffee decoction, mostly because I'm too lazy some days/ don't have time to make coffee, but using their recommended ratios (A little more milk than necessary, but that's fine, just keep reading) gave me a chemical tasting mess. No amount of milk can rescue that. Kind of sour. The milk was okay, no problems with it.

Please keep in mind that my first few sips were after brushing, however I had had quite a bit of water before those sips. However, I know what coffee tastes like sometimes after brushing, and this is not it. This is bad. If this is 'Ani's Favourite', Ani has a pretty bad sense of taste.

There is still some taste of coffee in there (And that coffee itself seems promising), but even that was recovered only after adding a pinch of salt and some jaggery.

I am writing this with the aftertaste still in the back of my neck. Even half-decent coffee doesn't have this aftertaste.

I've also got their filter coffee grounds, I'll make a review about that later.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.
