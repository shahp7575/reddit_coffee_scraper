A few years ago, I didn’t think I’d ever recover.  
I woke up every day tangled in guilt, anxiety, and a cycle I swore I’d break — but never did.  
Until one afternoon, sitting in a cramped counseling office with bad coffee and fluorescent lighting, something shifted.  
It wasn’t one of those movie moments where everything “clicked.” It was quieter than that — a sentence that still sticks with me:  

> “You’re not broken. You’re healing in motion.”  

That day marked the start of my recovery.  

---

Through addiction counseling, I learned that healing is messy, honest, and deeply human.  
The process didn’t just pull me out of darkness — it taught me how to *stay in the light.*  

And that’s why I wrote **_Addiction Counseling: A Path to Recovery and Healing_** → [https://trendwave-usa.kit.com/3d4461955f](https://trendwave-usa.kit.com/3d4461955f)  

I wanted to turn everything I learned (the tears, the relapses, the small wins) into something that might help someone else avoid the mistakes I made.  

---

Here are a few raw truths counseling taught me — maybe they’ll meet you where you are:  

- **Recovery isn’t linear.** You’ll stumble. Sometimes spectacularly. But progress isn’t about perfection — it’s about consistency.  
- **You can’t logic your way out of pain.** Feel it. Face it. Talk through it. Hiding only delays the healing.  
- **Support systems matter more than willpower.** White-knuckling your way through recovery rarely works. Let people in, even when it feels uncomfortable.  
- **Relapses don’t erase progress.** Every setback teaches you something about the triggers you need to manage tomorrow.  

---

Addiction counseling didn’t give me a clean slate — it gave me perspective.  
It showed me how to navigate guilt, how to rebuild trust, and how to exist without the constant need to escape reality.  

If you—or someone you love—are walking this same path, I built a guide filled with grounded strategies, real exercises, and compassion you can actually feel.  
📘 See it here → [https://trendwave-usa.kit.com/3d4461955f](https://trendwave-usa.kit.com/3d4461955f)

💡 *Here’s what you’ll find inside:*  
- Cognitive tools that actually stick when emotions run high  
- Step-by-step journaling prompts used in real therapy sessions  
- Healing checklists to measure progress (not perfection)  
- Methods for developing a sustainable support circle  

Even if you never download the guide, please remember this: you are not the worst thing you’ve done — you’re the courage it takes to start again.

I’ve noticed for my whole life, if my sleep is rough I tend to wake up either completely confused or straight up delusional, e.g I woke up a few days ago completely believing that one of my family members was coming to visit and I had to make my room as presentable as possible, in an almost unconscious state I remember anxiously tiding up my room (I tipped rubbish behind my bed and put my coffee mug in my closet hidden behind clothes) then going back to sleep. 

I don’t know if it’s sleep walking because I remember the panic of cleaning up, but realise I forget key things such as hiding a mug in my cupboard which I found a few days later. 


Does anyone know what this is? Or experienced something similar?

1oeo4zr,http://www.craftcollectivesalongroup.com,My honest experience at Craft Collective Salon Group — why it’s easily the best hair salon in Pittsburgh,"
There’s something about walking into a place where you instantly feel calm. That was my first thought the moment I stepped into Craft Collective Salon Group. It was early on a Saturday morning in the North Hills, that quiet window before the day really begins. The smell of clean products, a little coffee brewing in the back, soft music playing — it felt like the kind of place where people genuinely love what they do.

I had heard about Craft Collective for a while before finally booking an appointment. Friends kept saying things like “you’ll never go anywhere else after that” and “the energy in there is just different.” They were right. From the moment I checked in, it was clear this salon had its own rhythm.

The stylists were already busy, some working on blonding transformations, others finishing blowouts or mixing color at the back bar. Even though it was a full house, it never felt rushed. Everyone moved with purpose but still found time to greet clients, chat, and laugh. You could tell they loved being there, and that kind of atmosphere is contagious.

The stylist I saw took the time to actually talk with me — not just about what I wanted, but how my hair behaved, what my routine was, and what kind of time I really had to take care of it. It didn’t feel like an appointment; it felt like a collaboration. That’s what Craft Collective does so well. It’s not just about giving you a look for that day; it’s about giving you something you can live in and feel confident with every day.

The energy in the salon stays positive, even during the long hours. You see stylists staying late to finish color corrections or perfect a transformation. Nobody’s counting down the clock. There’s music, conversation, and laughter echoing through the mirrors. The team checks in on each other, offers to grab a drink or mix up another bowl of color. It’s the kind of teamwork that makes clients feel part of something bigger.

Craft Collective isn’t one of those salons that just talks about trends — they live them. Every stylist is constantly training, taking advanced classes, and learning new techniques. They care about the details, from how the highlights blend to how healthy your hair feels when you leave. And even with that level of skill, there’s still a sense of humility and warmth that’s hard to describe until you’ve experienced it yourself.

The salon itself has a clean, modern look — minimalist but not cold. Big mirrors, bright natural light, and a calm vibe that feels professional yet friendly. You’ll see stylists helping each other set up stations or checking in on guests between appointments. It’s small gestures like that which make the difference.

By the time my appointment was over, I realized something that stuck with me. Most salons can give you a nice haircut. Some can even give you great color. But very few can make you feel completely at ease while also delivering top-tier results. Craft Collective Salon Group manages to do both, effortlessly.

It’s not a salon that’s trying to be trendy just for attention — it’s a place built around people who genuinely care about their work and their clients. You can feel it in the conversations, in the atmosphere, and even in the way the staff says goodbye at the end of the day. It’s the kind of place that makes you look forward to your next appointment, not because you need one, but because you want to be there again.

If you’ve been searching for that perfect balance of artistry, comfort, and community, Craft Collective Salon Group really is the best hair salon in Pittsburgh. They’ve built something special here — a space where long hours turn into creative energy, where clients become friends, and where every person who walks out the door leaves looking and feeling their absolute best.

I’ve tried to laugh it off, but people are starting to make comments like “you two are cute together.” I have a boyfriend, which I’ve mentioned several times. When I told my coworker that the “work wife” thing makes me uncomfortable, he got quiet and later said I “overreacted” because “it’s just office banter.”

I was finishing the base for my halloween costume when My mother called for me, asking if I could help move stuff like the coffee table and trays so she could vacuum the carpet so she could crochet this giant 4 by 6 foot blanket. I, of course, said yes, because it would take like, 30 seconds and not like I was doing anything I couldn't stop. 

After we finshed moving things I remembered that I needed some paint for small details on the body. I asked her if she had any acrylic paint, not knowing that there is different types of liquid paint aside from those cheap paint bottles from dollarama. 

She said that she'd look for if she had any, and that they might be in the small cupboard, we moved the couple items in front of the cupboard inside, I opened the small doors to see a bunch of drawings and two suitcases. 

My brain was confused, not seeing any paint bottles, yet I didnt say anything. She said they might also have some in the small pullout drawer but to check there in the cupboard. 

I had closed it at the point she said that, so I though maybe I missed something, annoyed I put some force into the small doors and opened them.

Only to hear her say in a raised voice ""wait! I said wait! Bella's painting is next to it!"" Huh, wait what? My brain was confused untill I heard a stern ""STOP"" I froze, not sure what was happening.

Suddenly I hear ""Why dont you listen? I put up a boundarie and you ignore it!"" Then ""go sit over on the chair, out!"" I moved backwards, failling on the chair looking down. ""Your just like your dad, your so selfish. You want everything I have! Dont come crying  to me when you can't finish your costume!"" She said as she got ready, saying she needed to go get smokes. 

I was just left there, sitting in the same position thinking 'what did I do wrong?' 'God shes right im selfish, I should've just bought it myself' 'why am I like this?' 'This is all my fault' 'stop having a pity party about yourself and for once you might change!' 'That railing looks real nice..' etc

I decided I should do something useful and do what I'd said I do which is take out the carboard and garbage.

I walked down the stairs crying and threw the trash out. When I looked back I didn't feel like going back to that apartment and seeing her. I needed a second opinion if it was my fault and if what she said was true.

I walked to my brothers, knowing I left my phone in the apartment but not wanting to set an inche back in there I carried on. I knocked on the door and his roomates answered, I asked if my brother, Bon. Was there.

They did and as I held together my last parts of emotional stability I entered his room and cried my eyes out. I explained everything and said it wasn't my fault. Shes got issues and it shouldnt feel like her emotion control is my issue.

But I want your guys opinion! What do you think? Im open to being wrong, as long as I grow from it, ya'know? Sorry if its long or weridly writen.",1,1761278574.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

--

I am the villain in a story about a runaway bride and her secret baby.

My father was just about to sign over a portfolio of downtown real estate—a dowry worth five billion dollars—to my fiancé, Noah Harrison, when the words appeared in the air before me, shimmering like a heat haze.

[What a fool this villainess is. In three days, the heroine is going to return from overseas with his kid. By then, she’ll lose both the man and the money.]

[That’s not all. Because she humiliates the heroine, the hero is going to bankrupt her family’s company. Her father will have a stroke, her mother will lose her mind, and she’ll be handed over to a group of men hired by the hero and left for dead.]

[And then, the hero will let the heroine take over the villainess’s family company. Tsk, tsk. The ultimate rags-to-riches story!]

My hand shot out and snatched the portfolio transfer agreement from the table.

Meeting Noah’s sharp, questioning gaze, I offered him a cool smile. ""Let’s sign a prenup first. How about this: if, within the first three years of our marriage, you cheat, become violent, or are discovered to have a secret child, you’ll pay me three times the value of my dowry. And the engagement settlement is non-refundable. Deal?""

1

My knuckles were white, my grip on the transfer agreement unyielding.

The warm, celebratory atmosphere of our family dinner instantly turned cold and heavy.

Noah stared at me for a few seconds, a slow, unreadable smile playing on his lips. ""Tessa,"" he said, his voice dangerously soft. ""Are you treating our marriage like a business transaction?""

His parents immediately jumped in, trying to smooth things over. ""Oh, Tessa, you know Noah. You two have known each other since you were children. There's never been another woman in his life.""

But the words in the air kept scrolling.

[Well, that’s technically true. The hero was drugged when he had that one-night stand with the heroine. He barely remembers it himself.]

[Slept with her is slept with her. The hero can only belong to the heroine! But how did the villainess guess?]

[Rich girl doesn’t equal dumb girl. She’s the heiress to the Ford Corporation, after all. A little risk assessment is normal.]

[Suddenly, I feel like this villainess has some game. I’m starting to worry about my girl, the heroine…]

My own parents tugged at my sleeve. ""Tessa, darling, we trust Noah. He's not that kind of person.""

But I didn't let go of the agreement.

Noah’s voice was laced with ice. ""It seems you don’t have much faith in me, Tessa. In that case, perhaps we should postpone the engagement party.""

Without another word, he turned and walked out.

I watched his tall, impeccably tailored figure disappear down the long hallway before I finally allowed myself to breathe.

Losing the man was one thing.

Losing five billion dollars in prime Manhattan real estate? That was irreplaceable.

2

When we got home, my parents scolded me for being so reckless.

Our engagement party was supposed to be in three days. The entire upper echelon of New York society was invited. The engraved invitations had already been sent.

Tonight’s dinner was meant to finalize the wedding plans.

A postponement now would undoubtedly start a firestorm of gossip.

But compared to what was supposed to happen at that party—a lost five-year-old boy clinging to Noah’s leg and calling him ""Daddy""—a little gossip was nothing.

A little boy who, according to the text, was the spitting image of a young Noah Harrison.

""Dad, Mom,"" I said, my voice calm and steady. ""You've met more people than I've had hot dinners. Tell me, how many men with Noah Harrison's wealth and status are truly saints? Even if he was one before, that’s no guarantee for the future.""

My words gave them pause.

Finally, they relented. They would speak to the Harrisons in a couple of days. We would use the excuse of me feeling unwell to postpone the party for a month.

A month was fine.

After all, the heroine was due to arrive in three days.

3

As a gesture of apology to our esteemed guests, the engagement party was rebranded.

Three days later, it became a gala celebrating the Ford Corporation’s successful bid to develop a massive new public plaza project in the city center.

The same elite crowd gathered, sipping champagne and networking.

The Harrisons were, of course, on the guest list.

I had just stepped out of my car when a new set of words floated before my eyes.

[Here we go! The first meeting between the heroine and the villainess! Can't wait for the classic 'hero saves the damsel' scene.]

[The cute little munchkin is here to help Mommy find Daddy!]

[I wonder if the villainess will regret postponing the engagement when she sees them. She lost her only chance to lock the hero down, hahaha!]

My eyes instinctively began scanning the lavish ballroom, searching for a small child.

But before I could spot them, I saw Noah walking toward me.

He was dressed in a sharp black suit, his presence as commanding as ever.

""As you requested,"" he said, his voice a low murmur. ""I'll have the prenuptial agreement notarized and sent to you as soon as possible. The engagement party will proceed as planned, one month from now.""

He looked down at me, his eyes filled with a kind of playful curiosity. ""But I have to admit, I'm intrigued. Who's been giving you advice?""

We may have grown up together, but I'd always known Noah Harrison was a man ruled by logic, not passion. If it hadn't been for our parents pushing us together for years, I doubt he would have ever given me a second glance. He probably thought I was just like all the other socialites—an empty-headed debutante with a pretty face. It was only after I got my acceptance letter to Wharton that he even considered dating me.

His idea of a romantic confession was a curt, ""It seems I've underestimated you.""

If there was ever a flicker of affection he felt for me in the past, it was surely gone now. He must think I'm a cold, calculating schemer.

Meeting his probing gaze, I just smiled. ""Who can say no to a good insurance policy?""

With a fifteen-billion-dollar penalty clause and a six-billion-dollar engagement settlement at stake, I could find any man I wanted.

Just then, a commotion erupted near the entrance.

A young woman in a simple white dress, with a sweet, innocent face, rushed into the venue, grabbing people by the arm. ""Excuse me, have you seen my son?""

4

The person she grabbed was one of my family's security guards.

He frowned, trying to escort her out. ""Ma'am, this is a private event. You can't be in here. Please leave immediately.""

But the woman was on the verge of tears. ""No, my son is missing! He’s only five, I have to find him! Let me in!""

""Please wait by the entrance. If we find a child, we will bring him to you.""

""But I'm his mother! I have to go in! Let go of me, or I'll call the police! Ah!""

In the ensuing struggle, she stumbled and fell to the marble floor, scraping her porcelain-skinned leg. It started to bleed.

Instantly, a little boy shot out from behind a large floral arrangement and slammed into the security guard, knocking him off balance. ""Don't you bully my mommy!""

The woman then scooped the boy into her arms, and the two of them huddled together, crying, a picture of pathetic misery.

[Like master, like servant. No surprise a dog raised by her would be so aggressive!]

[A grown man bullying a single mother and her child. His conscience must have been eaten by a dog.]

[Just wait. When the villainess’s family goes bankrupt, we’ll see how arrogant these servants are.]

Noah watched the scene unfold with a frown, then turned to me. ""It seems the security at the Ford Estate is a bit lacking. And your staff's professionalism could use some work.""

Then, as if to deliberately spite me, the man famous for his icy aloofness strode forward and extended a hand to the fallen woman. ""Get up. I'll have someone take you to the hospital.""

The woman stared at him for a long moment, her eyes widening as if she'd seen a ghost. Then she grabbed her son and tried to run.

But the little boy's face lit up with pure joy. ""Daddy!"" he shouted at Noah. ""Mommy, I found Daddy!""

5

The child's voice was clear and high, immediately drawing the attention of every guest in the vicinity.

Before anyone, including Noah, could react, the woman had scooped up the boy and vanished into the night.

My father materialized at my side, his face grim. ""What was that all about?"" he whispered.

I shrugged. ""I have no idea. But the kid called Noah 'Daddy.' See, Dad? I told you the prenup was a good idea.""

Our hushed conversation drifted to the nearby guests, and the celebratory mood of the evening soured.

After the party, the Harrisons came over with Noah to offer an explanation.

""Tessa, there must be some misunderstanding!"" Mrs. Harrison insisted.

Noah's face was a thundercloud. For the first time, he spoke to me with a hint of defensiveness. ""I can't possibly have a son. For that woman to show up now, at this exact moment… she's clearly after something.""

The floating text reappeared.

[This isn't how it's supposed to go… Shouldn't the hero have seen the resemblance, abandoned the villainess, and run after the heroine?]

[And the villainess is way too calm. Wasn't she supposed to fly into a jealous rage, slap the heroine, and then get pushed away by the hero?]

[Don't worry, everyone. Once the heroine starts working at the hero's company, the plot should get back on track.]

Oh? She’s going to work at Harrison Industries?

I couldn't help but raise an eyebrow at Noah. ""Are you… sure you don't want to get a paternity test first? What if he really is the result of a wild night you don't remember?""

A vein pulsed in Noah's temple. He grabbed my wrist, his grip tight. ""Tessa, I don't know who has been whispering poison in your ear, but listen to me. Other than you, I have never laid a finger on another woman. I will find her and get to the bottom of this. And then, our engagement party will proceed as planned.""

Fine by me.

Let's see you get past hiring the heroine first.

I gently patted his hand. ""Don't get so worked up. It's only fifteen billion dollars. I'm sure you can afford it.""

As I turned to leave, I saw Noah violently loosen his tie, looking like he was about to kick the leg off the nearest coffee table.

6

After the gala disaster, my parents stopped mentioning the engagement.

Meanwhile, rumors about Noah and the Harrison family began to circulate through our social circles. When I arrived at Harrison Industries for a progress meeting on a joint venture between our companies, I could feel the weight of everyone's knowing glances.

""Did you hear? Mr. Harrison has a secret son. The mother and child caused a huge scene at the Ford Estate…""

""What? The Ice Prince of Wall Street has fallen?""

""I knew there was a reason they postponed the engagement… Miss Ford looks perfectly healthy to me.""

""It's Mr. Harrison who looks like a mess. He's been in a foul mood for weeks, apparently, he has his P.I.s searching everywhere for that woman.""

I was engrossed in the gossip when I saw the head of HR walking a group of new hires down the hallway outside the glass-walled conference room.

The heroine was among them.

She was still in all white, a picture of nervous excitement.

Here for her interview?

My interest piqued, I was about to step out for a closer look when I nearly collided with Noah, who looked haggard and was radiating a ""do not approach"" aura.

He grabbed my arm. ""Where are you going?""

""Oh… nowhere, just saw someone I thought I knew,"" I said with a breezy laugh.

Noah frowned and glanced in the direction I'd been looking. The tour group had already moved on. All he saw was a handsome, broad-shouldered young man with a sunny disposition carrying two coffees our way. The young man caught our eye and gave a shy smile.

Noah's grip on my arm tightened.

""You know, your eyes used to only be for me,"" he said, his voice dripping with a strange, acidic tone. ""What's this? Developed a new taste recently?""

""I…""

I was about to tell him he was mistaken, that I was looking at the baby mama, not the pretty boy.

But Noah cut me off, turning to his assistant. ""Who is this person?""

The assistant looked from the bewildered pretty boy to his equally bewildered boss. ""I believe he's a new recruit from our fall intake. A top graduate from Yale.""

Noah scoffed. ""Transfer him to the regional office in Stamford.""

Then he turned back to me, his words heavy with meaning. ""A word of advice, Tessa. Be careful with pretty boys. Most of them are only after your money.""

I just stared at him. ""???""

7

After the meeting, Noah walked with me out of the conference room.

As we passed through the main office area, we saw the Yale graduate from earlier, packing his desk with a dejected look on his face.

I paused, turning to Noah. ""A top mind from Yale, and you're just sending him to a satellite office? That seems like a waste. If you don't want him, I'll take him. He can be my new assistant at Ford.""

The sound that followed was a loud smack. Noah had slammed his palm down on the partition of a nearby cubicle.

He leaned in close, that same unreadable, half-smiling expression on his face.

""Tessa. Our engagement is postponed. Not canceled.""

Sensing the sudden drop in atmospheric pressure, every employee in the vicinity shrank behind their monitors.

Only one person dared to speak. A small, timid voice. ""Mr. Harrison… my files…""

I glanced down and my eyebrows shot up.

What a coincidence.

Noah had chosen, of all the desks in this vast office, the new desk of the heroine.

And his hand was currently planted firmly on top of her paperwork.

He followed my gaze, and his face instantly darkened. He barked at his assistant, ""What is she doing here?""

The assistant looked and his own face went pale. ""She must be one of the new hires who started today…""

The text in front of my eyes went wild.

[Aaaah, here it is! Go on, hero! Be brave! Break off the engagement with the villainess and bring our heroine and her little angel home!]

[Something feels off… Why is the hero looking at the heroine like he wants to murder her?]

[Oh, relax! That’s just how enemies-to-lovers stories start~]

[But he really looks like he’s jealous over that Yale guy right now…]

[Can I just say, this villainess has way too much screen time. Can she just get lost already?]

At that moment, the heroine—Ava—looked up and saw Noah's face. All the color drained from hers. She scrambled to her feet to run, but in her panic, she tripped over her own chair and fell, landing in a heap right at my feet.

I instinctively took a step back.

Was this some kind of insurance scam?

She looked helpless, trying to push herself up, her voice choked with tears. ""I'm sorry, I didn't know this was your company, I'll leave right now…""

But Noah grabbed her arm. ""Wait. You're not going anywhere until you explain yourself.""

The woman looked back at him, tears welling in her eyes, a mixture of fear and what looked like wounded pride. She struggled weakly against his grip. ""I… I have nothing to say…""

Noah let out a cold laugh. ""The Ford Estate is on a private mountain road. You can't get up there without a car, and there are guards at the main gate. How did you get in? And the child—where did you hire him?""

She just stared at him, biting her lip, refusing to speak.

Just then, the little boy came running out from behind a pillar, launching himself at Noah's leg and beating it with his tiny fists. ""Bad Daddy! You're bullying Mommy for that bad woman! You don't deserve to be my daddy!""

This time, in the bright office lights, we all got a clear look at the boy's face.

There was no denying it. He was a miniature Noah Harrison.

Even Noah, usually so composed, had a flicker of doubt cross his face.

8

The last time we'd seen the boy, he was wearing a baseball cap and it was dark. This time, there was no ambiguity.

A ripple of whispers went through the office.

""Oh my god, the resemblance is uncanny…""

""Even if he’s not his son, he has to be a relative, right?""

""I told you, where there's smoke, there's fire… and the woman is very pretty. Maybe the boss really did have a thing with her.""

Noah's face was grim as he escorted them both back to his family's town car. I tried to slip away, but he wrapped an arm around my waist and guided me into the car with them.

""We are going to settle this today, in front of both our families.""

My parents, having heard about the commotion, were already on their way to the Harrison residence.

In the car, the woman—who said her name was Ava Miller and her son was Nicky—admitted the boy was hers, but she refused to name the father. She claimed she only took the job at Harrison Industries to provide a better life for her son and had no other intentions. As for the boy… she said he'd snuck out of his daycare because he was worried his mommy would get bullied at her new job.

The child, his neck stiff with defiance, glared at me. ""It's a good thing I came, or my mommy would have been eaten alive by a mean woman like you! My mommy is the kindest, most innocent person in the world, and I have to protect her!""

I just stared back. ""???""

At the Harrison's Park Avenue penthouse, Ava stood protectively in front of her son, enduring the scrutiny of our assembled families.

After a long, tense silence, Mrs. Harrison spoke, her voice strained. ""Noah. Are you absolutely certain you don't know her?""

Mr. Harrison was on the phone, pacing. A video of the office confrontation, filmed by an employee, was already going viral online. The comments were brutal, painting a picture of a callous billionaire knocking up a common girl and refusing to take responsibility. Someone had even made a side-by-side comparison of Noah's childhood photos and Nicky's face. The resemblance was damning.

The text floated lazily in front of me.

[My poor babies, being stared at like animals in a zoo. Why isn't the hero protecting his wife?]

[Don't you see the villainess sitting right next to him? If he defends the heroine now, the villainess will go crazy and plot even worse things against her. He's obviously weighing his options.]

[I don't know… are we watching the same show? He doesn't look like he wants to protect her. He looks like he wants to strangle her…]

I glanced over at Noah. His face was a mask of thunderous rage. ""Mom,"" he gritted out, ""you don't believe me either?""

Finally, I spoke, breaking the suffocating silence. ""Mrs. Harrison, this seems pretty simple to me. Just get a paternity test. If the boy is his, I'll call off the wedding.""

9

""Tessa, don't you dare!""

Noah looked like he was about to explode.

I pointed at the boy, my expression one of pure innocence. ""I mean, look at that face. Are you honestly telling me you don't see any family resemblance?""

Noah’s jaw tightened, and he sank back into his seat, fuming.

Just as the standoff reached its peak, Ava suddenly dropped to her knees with a thud, pulling Nicky down with her onto the cold marble floor.

""I'm so sorry,"" she cried, her voice breaking. ""I never should have disturbed your peaceful lives! It's all my fault. If only… if only I hadn't given birth to him!""

With that, she grabbed Nicky and, to everyone's horror, began slapping the little boy's face, her hand striking his soft cheeks again and again.

""I told you not to call random men Daddy! I told you! Apologize to the nice lady and gentleman! Apologize right now! If you don't, then you can just forget you ever had a mother! I don't want a disobedient child like you!""

Nicky was stunned into silence, then began to wail, tears streaming down his already reddening face. He clung to his mother's sleeve, sobbing, ""I'm sorry, Mommy, I'm sorry, Nicky's sorry…""

""What are you sorry for?!"" Ava shrieked, not satisfied. She grabbed his ear and twisted, eliciting a sharp scream from the boy.

The scene was agonizing to watch. Even Noah, who had been the most hostile towards them, winced, a flicker of pity in his eyes. Mrs. Harrison started to reach for the child, but she glanced at me and hesitated.

I could see Nicky's little ear turning purple. It was about to start bleeding.

That was it. I shot forward, grabbing Ava's wrist and pulling the trembling child into my arms.

""That's enough, Miss Miller,"" I said, my voice dangerously calm. ""Don't you think you've gone a little too far?""",1,1761278310.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

Instantly, a little boy shot out from behind a large floral arrangement and slammed into the security guard, knocking him off balance. ""Don't you bully my mommy!""

The woman then scooped the boy into her arms, and the two of them huddled together, crying, a picture of pathetic misery.

[Like master, like servant. No surprise a dog raised by her would be so aggressive!]

[A grown man bullying a single mother and her child. His conscience must have been eaten by a dog.]

[Just wait. When the villainess’s family goes bankrupt, we’ll see how arrogant these servants are.]

Noah watched the scene unfold with a frown, then turned to me. ""It seems the security at the Ford Estate is a bit lacking. And your staff's professionalism could use some work.""

Then, as if to deliberately spite me, the man famous for his icy aloofness strode forward and extended a hand to the fallen woman. ""Get up. I'll have someone take you to the hospital.""

The woman stared at him for a long moment, her eyes widening as if she'd seen a ghost. Then she grabbed her son and tried to run.

But the little boy's face lit up with pure joy. ""Daddy!"" he shouted at Noah. ""Mommy, I found Daddy!""

5

The child's voice was clear and high, immediately drawing the attention of every guest in the vicinity.

Before anyone, including Noah, could react, the woman had scooped up the boy and vanished into the night.

My father materialized at my side, his face grim. ""What was that all about?"" he whispered.

I shrugged. ""I have no idea. But the kid called Noah 'Daddy.' See, Dad? I told you the prenup was a good idea.""

Our hushed conversation drifted to the nearby guests, and the celebratory mood of the evening soured.

After the party, the Harrisons came over with Noah to offer an explanation.

""Tessa, there must be some misunderstanding!"" Mrs. Harrison insisted.

Noah's face was a thundercloud. For the first time, he spoke to me with a hint of defensiveness. ""I can't possibly have a son. For that woman to show up now, at this exact moment… she's clearly after something.""

The floating text reappeared.

[This isn't how it's supposed to go… Shouldn't the hero have seen the resemblance, abandoned the villainess, and run after the heroine?]

[And the villainess is way too calm. Wasn't she supposed to fly into a jealous rage, slap the heroine, and then get pushed away by the hero?]

[Don't worry, everyone. Once the heroine starts working at the hero's company, the plot should get back on track.]

Oh? She’s going to work at Harrison Industries?

I couldn't help but raise an eyebrow at Noah. ""Are you… sure you don't want to get a paternity test first? What if he really is the result of a wild night you don't remember?""

A vein pulsed in Noah's temple. He grabbed my wrist, his grip tight. ""Tessa, I don't know who has been whispering poison in your ear, but listen to me. Other than you, I have never laid a finger on another woman. I will find her and get to the bottom of this. And then, our engagement party will proceed as planned.""

Fine by me.

Let's see you get past hiring the heroine first.

I gently patted his hand. ""Don't get so worked up. It's only fifteen billion dollars. I'm sure you can afford it.""

As I turned to leave, I saw Noah violently loosen his tie, looking like he was about to kick the leg off the nearest coffee table.

6

After the gala disaster, my parents stopped mentioning the engagement.

Meanwhile, rumors about Noah and the Harrison family began to circulate through our social circles. When I arrived at Harrison Industries for a progress meeting on a joint venture between our companies, I could feel the weight of everyone's knowing glances.

""Did you hear? Mr. Harrison has a secret son. The mother and child caused a huge scene at the Ford Estate…""

""What? The Ice Prince of Wall Street has fallen?""

""I knew there was a reason they postponed the engagement… Miss Ford looks perfectly healthy to me.""

""It's Mr. Harrison who looks like a mess. He's been in a foul mood for weeks, apparently, he has his P.I.s searching everywhere for that woman.""

I was engrossed in the gossip when I saw the head of HR walking a group of new hires down the hallway outside the glass-walled conference room.

The heroine was among them.

She was still in all white, a picture of nervous excitement.

Here for her interview?

My interest piqued, I was about to step out for a closer look when I nearly collided with Noah, who looked haggard and was radiating a ""do not approach"" aura.

He grabbed my arm. ""Where are you going?""

""Oh… nowhere, just saw someone I thought I knew,"" I said with a breezy laugh.

Noah frowned and glanced in the direction I'd been looking. The tour group had already moved on. All he saw was a handsome, broad-shouldered young man with a sunny disposition carrying two coffees our way. The young man caught our eye and gave a shy smile.

Noah's grip on my arm tightened.

""You know, your eyes used to only be for me,"" he said, his voice dripping with a strange, acidic tone. ""What's this? Developed a new taste recently?""

""I…""

I was about to tell him he was mistaken, that I was looking at the baby mama, not the pretty boy.

But Noah cut me off, turning to his assistant. ""Who is this person?""

The assistant looked from the bewildered pretty boy to his equally bewildered boss. ""I believe he's a new recruit from our fall intake. A top graduate from Yale.""

Noah scoffed. ""Transfer him to the regional office in Stamford.""

Then he turned back to me, his words heavy with meaning. ""A word of advice, Tessa. Be careful with pretty boys. Most of them are only after your money.""

I just stared at him. ""???""

7

After the meeting, Noah walked with me out of the conference room.

As we passed through the main office area, we saw the Yale graduate from earlier, packing his desk with a dejected look on his face.

I paused, turning to Noah. ""A top mind from Yale, and you're just sending him to a satellite office? That seems like a waste. If you don't want him, I'll take him. He can be my new assistant at Ford.""

The sound that followed was a loud smack. Noah had slammed his palm down on the partition of a nearby cubicle.

He leaned in close, that same unreadable, half-smiling expression on his face.

""Tessa. Our engagement is postponed. Not canceled.""

Sensing the sudden drop in atmospheric pressure, every employee in the vicinity shrank behind their monitors.

Only one person dared to speak. A small, timid voice. ""Mr. Harrison… my files…""

I glanced down and my eyebrows shot up.

What a coincidence.

Noah had chosen, of all the desks in this vast office, the new desk of the heroine.

And his hand was currently planted firmly on top of her paperwork.

He followed my gaze, and his face instantly darkened. He barked at his assistant, ""What is she doing here?""

The assistant looked and his own face went pale. ""She must be one of the new hires who started today…""

The text in front of my eyes went wild.

[Aaaah, here it is! Go on, hero! Be brave! Break off the engagement with the villainess and bring our heroine and her little angel home!]

[Something feels off… Why is the hero looking at the heroine like he wants to murder her?]

[Oh, relax! That’s just how enemies-to-lovers stories start~]

[But he really looks like he’s jealous over that Yale guy right now…]

[Can I just say, this villainess has way too much screen time. Can she just get lost already?]

At that moment, the heroine—Ava—looked up and saw Noah's face. All the color drained from hers. She scrambled to her feet to run, but in her panic, she tripped over her own chair and fell, landing in a heap right at my feet.

I instinctively took a step back.

Was this some kind of insurance scam?

She looked helpless, trying to push herself up, her voice choked with tears. ""I'm sorry, I didn't know this was your company, I'll leave right now…""

But Noah grabbed her arm. ""Wait. You're not going anywhere until you explain yourself.""

The woman looked back at him, tears welling in her eyes, a mixture of fear and what looked like wounded pride. She struggled weakly against his grip. ""I… I have nothing to say…""

Noah let out a cold laugh. ""The Ford Estate is on a private mountain road. You can't get up there without a car, and there are guards at the main gate. How did you get in? And the child—where did you hire him?""

She just stared at him, biting her lip, refusing to speak.

Just then, the little boy came running out from behind a pillar, launching himself at Noah's leg and beating it with his tiny fists. ""Bad Daddy! You're bullying Mommy for that bad woman! You don't deserve to be my daddy!""

This time, in the bright office lights, we all got a clear look at the boy's face.

There was no denying it. He was a miniature Noah Harrison.

Even Noah, usually so composed, had a flicker of doubt cross his face.

8

The last time we'd seen the boy, he was wearing a baseball cap and it was dark. This time, there was no ambiguity.

A ripple of whispers went through the office.

""Oh my god, the resemblance is uncanny…""

""Even if he’s not his son, he has to be a relative, right?""

""I told you, where there's smoke, there's fire… and the woman is very pretty. Maybe the boss really did have a thing with her.""

Noah's face was grim as he escorted them both back to his family's town car. I tried to slip away, but he wrapped an arm around my waist and guided me into the car with them.

""We are going to settle this today, in front of both our families.""

My parents, having heard about the commotion, were already on their way to the Harrison residence.

In the car, the woman—who said her name was Ava Miller and her son was Nicky—admitted the boy was hers, but she refused to name the father. She claimed she only took the job at Harrison Industries to provide a better life for her son and had no other intentions. As for the boy… she said he'd snuck out of his daycare because he was worried his mommy would get bullied at her new job.

The child, his neck stiff with defiance, glared at me. ""It's a good thing I came, or my mommy would have been eaten alive by a mean woman like you! My mommy is the kindest, most innocent person in the world, and I have to protect her!""

I just stared back. ""???""

At the Harrison's Park Avenue penthouse, Ava stood protectively in front of her son, enduring the scrutiny of our assembled families.

After a long, tense silence, Mrs. Harrison spoke, her voice strained. ""Noah. Are you absolutely certain you don't know her?""

Mr. Harrison was on the phone, pacing. A video of the office confrontation, filmed by an employee, was already going viral online. The comments were brutal, painting a picture of a callous billionaire knocking up a common girl and refusing to take responsibility. Someone had even made a side-by-side comparison of Noah's childhood photos and Nicky's face. The resemblance was damning.

The text floated lazily in front of me.

[My poor babies, being stared at like animals in a zoo. Why isn't the hero protecting his wife?]

[Don't you see the villainess sitting right next to him? If he defends the heroine now, the villainess will go crazy and plot even worse things against her. He's obviously weighing his options.]

[I don't know… are we watching the same show? He doesn't look like he wants to protect her. He looks like he wants to strangle her…]

I glanced over at Noah. His face was a mask of thunderous rage. ""Mom,"" he gritted out, ""you don't believe me either?""

Finally, I spoke, breaking the suffocating silence. ""Mrs. Harrison, this seems pretty simple to me. Just get a paternity test. If the boy is his, I'll call off the wedding.""

9

""Tessa, don't you dare!""

Noah looked like he was about to explode.

I pointed at the boy, my expression one of pure innocence. ""I mean, look at that face. Are you honestly telling me you don't see any family resemblance?""

Noah’s jaw tightened, and he sank back into his seat, fuming.

Just as the standoff reached its peak, Ava suddenly dropped to her knees with a thud, pulling Nicky down with her onto the cold marble floor.

""I'm so sorry,"" she cried, her voice breaking. ""I never should have disturbed your peaceful lives! It's all my fault. If only… if only I hadn't given birth to him!""

With that, she grabbed Nicky and, to everyone's horror, began slapping the little boy's face, her hand striking his soft cheeks again and again.

""I told you not to call random men Daddy! I told you! Apologize to the nice lady and gentleman! Apologize right now! If you don't, then you can just forget you ever had a mother! I don't want a disobedient child like you!""

Nicky was stunned into silence, then began to wail, tears streaming down his already reddening face. He clung to his mother's sleeve, sobbing, ""I'm sorry, Mommy, I'm sorry, Nicky's sorry…""

""What are you sorry for?!"" Ava shrieked, not satisfied. She grabbed his ear and twisted, eliciting a sharp scream from the boy.

The scene was agonizing to watch. Even Noah, who had been the most hostile towards them, winced, a flicker of pity in his eyes. Mrs. Harrison started to reach for the child, but she glanced at me and hesitated.

I could see Nicky's little ear turning purple. It was about to start bleeding.

That was it. I shot forward, grabbing Ava's wrist and pulling the trembling child into my arms.

""That's enough, Miss Miller,"" I said, my voice dangerously calm. ""Don't you think you've gone a little too far?""",1,1761278272.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1oenv8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1oenv8v/how_to_stop_being_an_awkward_npc_the_ultimate/,How to stop being an awkward NPC: the ultimate guide to talking to girls with confidence,"Let’s be real. Way too many people (especially in their teens and 20s) are terrified of talking to girls. It’s not just you. I’ve seen it in classrooms, in coffee shops, in DMs, and even among grad students at Harvard. Somehow, we’re supposed to just “know” how to flirt, be interesting, read signals, and not be weird… all without ever being taught the basics. What makes it worse? TikTok and IG “dating coaches” spreading cringe-level advice like “just be alpha” or “girls love toxic confidence.” Spoiler: they’re often just projecting their loneliness into bite-size videos.

I’ve spent a decade digging into psychology, gender studies, and evolutionary behavior science. And I’ve watched too many people self-sabotage, not because they’re boring or broken, but because they’ve been fed the wrong script. Confidence isn’t magic. It’s a learnable skill. If you’re tired of overthinking everything you say or going full ghost mode when someone cute smiles at you, keep reading.

Here’s a breakdown of what actually helps (based on science, not pickup lines):

- **Don’t try to “impress,” try to connect**  
  Research from Dr. Arthur Aron (Stony Brook University) on interpersonal closeness shows that vulnerability and emotional exchange create deep attraction faster than surface-level bragging. Instead of flexing accomplishments, ask thoughtful questions, listen actively, and share something real about yourself. People remember how you make them feel, not how cool you say you are.

- **Use this mindset shift: “I’m just practicing”**  
  When you talk to someone new, remove the pressure of performance. Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck’s work on growth mindset proves that reframing situations as a learning opportunity reduces anxiety and boosts performance. Say to yourself, “This is just practice.” You don’t have to win. You just need to show up.

- **Kill the idea of rejection as personal failure**  
  Studies from University of Michigan found that social rejection activates the same areas in the brain as physical pain. But here’s the trick, most of the time, rejection isn’t about you. It’s about timing, mood, or their own insecurities. Detach your value from their response. Confidence is built when you stop tying your worth to outcomes.

- **Warm up socially before approaching**  
  Confidence is contextual. Behavioral psychologists suggest “social priming”, warming up by talking to others in casual, low-stakes ways first. Start your day saying “hi” to a barista, asking a stranger for directions, or complimenting someone’s outfit. This builds momentum and lowers the psychological barrier.

- **Micro-body language fixes change everything**  
  Dr. Amy Cuddy’s research at Harvard on power poses and nonverbal behavior shows that open body language (upright posture, uncrossed arms, steady eye contact) boosts testosterone and lowers cortisol. Translation: you feel more confident just by standing like you are. Practice this before entering any social interaction.

- **Learn this script and adapt it**  
  “Hey, I noticed you seem really interesting and I wanted to say hi. I’m [Name].”  
  Simple. Direct. Respectful. No weird lines. No “rizz.” It signals confidence and clarity. And it opens the door for actual conversation. If they’re not into it? Cool. You left with your dignity and some reps in.

Here are some killer resources that go way deeper:

- **Book: *Models: Attract Women Through Honesty* by Mark Manson**  
  Bestseller by the same guy who wrote *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F***.* But this one's even better. It flips dating advice on its head. Teaches you to stop pretending and start building real value as a person. Especially powerful if you’ve been stuck in “nice guy” territory. This book will make you question everything you think you know about attraction.

- **Book: *Attached* by Amir Levine & Rachel Heller**  
  NYT Bestseller written by a psychiatrist and a psychologist. Breaks down attachment theory in the context of dating. Helped me understand why some people ghost, chase, or push others away. If you’ve ever asked “why do I attract emotionally unavailable people?” this is the book. Insanely good read.

- **App: BeFreed**  
  If you're overwhelmed by dating advice or want to actually build real social confidence, this app is a game-changer. It’s built by a team from Columbia University. BeFreed turns self-help books, expert talks, and top podcasts into personalized learning paths you can actually stick to. You can pick podcast length (10, 20, 40 min), change the voice of the host, and it learns your style over time to build a custom curriculum. It’s the best way to absorb ideas like attachment theory, emotional intelligence, body language, and self-confidence without doomscrolling. Bonus: all the books I mentioned above are covered inside too.

- **Podcast: *The Art of Charm***  
  One of the longest running podcasts on social confidence, communication, and dating. Hosted by AJ Harbinger (behavioral psychology background). Covers everything from networking to flirting to charisma-building. Way more science-based than most dating pods.

- **YouTube: Charisma on Command**  
  Breaks down why people like Chris Hemsworth, Zendaya, or Ryan Reynolds are so engaging. Teaches you how to apply those tactics in everyday conversations. Their video on “How to Be Charming Without Being Fake” is a must-watch. The breakdowns are so sharp you’ll never look at social interactions the same way.

- **Book: *The Like Switch* by Jack Schafer**  
  Written by an ex-FBI agent who specialized in behavioral analysis. Teaches you the psychology of making people instantly like and trust you. Uses real case studies. Super practical stuff, facial expressions, tone, pacing. This is the best book I’ve ever read on social influence.

- **Reddit: r/socialskills**  
  Underrated gem. Way more thoughtful than typical “dating advice” subs. People share real struggles, and the mods keep it honest and wholesome. Great place to get feedback on convos, profiles, and mindset issues.

- **YouTube: The School of Life**  
  More philosophical, but insanely helpful for understanding emotional maturity, love, insecurity, and connection. If you vibe with deeper psychology, this will blow your mind. Start with “Why We Don’t Know How to Love.”

Talking to girls isn’t about memorizing lines or pretending to be someone else. It’s about slowly building the skill of presence, empathy, and self-trust. You don’t need to be the loudest person in the room. Just the most real one.",1,1761278070.0,OdysseyBookClub,0,1.0,False

1oenruz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oenruz,Need input on paint colour for walls and trim,"Full disclaimer. I have bad decision paralysis with this stuff. In the end, it's just paint and can always be changed 

I need input on two things:

1. Wall colour- would you go with Swiss coffee or simply white against the green cabinets?

2. We are trying to decide if we want to leave the frame on our large window white or go bold with a orange/brown to pick up on other elements in the room. See attached picture. 

The space will include a green banquette bench, which will have an upholstered back. I included a sample of the upholstery and hung it over the bench. There is already an exposed brick wall. And we will also have a walnut table and white pendant light overhanging 

Our gut is to go with a white trim since the space already has so much colour/business, even though a bold frame is ++fun 

For reference, I included a third picture showing the floors and countertops, in case that helps with making paint colour recommendations. All of the other trim in the room will be oxford white

We get sick of getting up every 15 minutes when she decides to play her mind games and we usually grab a few treats to put in arms reach.

After a year of this, she figured out that we would leave them on the coffee table (our last cat figured it out in a week and would eat the ones she liked). We rearranged the living room and she now cannot find them. I'm also not sure she even has the brain capacity to look? 

Anyway, here she is sitting next to a treat that is going on 24 hours on the arm of the couch she often spends part of the night sleeping on.

I am interested in joining the Episcopal Church and am based in the Brighton neighborhood of Boston. 

I’d love to hear your recommendations! Here’s some background on me and my interests:

- I’m a man in my early 30s; I’d ideally like to find an active congregation with a good number of young people, including young men (it seems like they are kind of rare in TEC)
- I’m drawn to high church “smells and bells”
- I’m looking for “inclusive orthodoxy”; I’m gay, and I don’t want a hostile environment, but I also don’t want to be pandered to and I don’t want to feel like I’m at a progressive activism club (I’m a political moderate who is generally turned off by identity politics)

I visited a parish in Brookline and enjoyed the Compline service, but it appears to be an older, heavily political congregation.

I visited a parish in Beacon Hill and honestly had a blast at their coffee hour. I might go back. They welcomed me and were very friendly. Tons of gay men there, but also country club types who seemed a bit cliquish and self-consciously conservative. The latter makes me a bit nervous that I won’t fit in; I’m a simple country boy at heart and idk if I can keep up. The service was beautiful; maybe even a smidge too high church for me, which I didn’t know was possible lol.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Los Angeles Kings vs. Dallas Stars: A Tale of Two Toaster Offenses**

The Los Angeles Kings and Dallas Stars are set to clash in a game that promises the excitement of a tax audit and the scoring pace of a glacier. Both teams have offensives that could make a vegan wince—Kings averaging a paltry 2.57 goals per game (7th worst in the NHL) and the Stars scoring a combined five goals in their last three games, including one in each of the last two. It’s like watching two chefs try to cook a five-star meal with only a toaster and a single bag of frozen waffles.

**Odds & Implied Probabilities**  
The moneyline has the Stars as heavy favorites at -161 (implied probability: 61.9%) and the Kings at +130 (38.1%). For context, the Kings would need to win roughly 40% of the time to make this line fair, but their recent form—ending a four-game skid with a 2-1 overtime win—suggests they’re more likely to play chess with the puck than checkers. The puck line (-1.5 for Dallas, +1.5 for LA) reflects the Stars’ slight edge, but given their offensive struggles, betting on them to cover might be like asking a mime to explain quantum physics. The Under 5.5 total is a +100 favorite, and with both teams combining for a projected 4.5 goals (give or take a coffee spill), this is the safest bet since “not betting on the Toronto Maple Leafs to score a hat trick.”

**Injury Report: A Hall of Fame Absences**  
The Kings are missing Anže Kopitar, their captain and emotional leader, who’s sidelined with a foot injury. Without him, LA’s offense is like a symphony missing its conductor—confusing, chaotic, and likely to end with someone playing the triangle aggressively. The Stars aren’t faring better: Jamie Benn (their emotional engine) and Matt Duchene (mystery injury) are out, leaving them with the offensive firepower of a team that forgot to pack bullets. It’s a “who’s who” of absences, and if hockey had a Hall of Shame for injured stars, this game would get a lifetime membership.

Hello! I'm a new poster I just really need some honest opinions. Please be gentle; kindness really does go a long way, but don’t be afraid to call me out if you think I’m missing something. I’m not perfect, and I’ll admit when I’m wrong. I’ll try to include as much detail as possible, but if you have any questions, I don’t mind answering them. :)

So… I’ve always had a complicated relationship with my mom. “Complicated” because it wasn’t all bad, there were happy moments, but she’s also done things that left a lasting mark on me. I didn’t realize how much they stayed with me until I got older, and honestly, some of them still hurt when I think about them.

I could go on forever if I tried to list everything, but I’ll give a few examples that might paint the picture.

To put it simply, my mom sees a lot of herself in me or maybe she wants to. She had a really wild childhood. She’s told me stories about stealing, fighting, skipping school, and having a lot of reckless relationships. She was such a handful that my nana used to say she hoped my mom would one day have a kid just like her, basically as payback for how hard she was to raise. But instead, I turned out the complete opposite.

I was homeschooled most of my life, quiet, stayed out of trouble, didn’t talk back, didn’t steal, didn’t do drugs, just… normal. But despite that, whenever I went out with friends, my mom assumed I was doing the same things she did when she was young. The reality? I was usually at work or at a coffee shop getting things done. Still, she never believed me.

Another example: when I was 16, we were getting ready to go to a festival. Being homeschooled from 5th to 12th grade, I didn’t get many chances to go out, so I was very excited to dress up a bit and feel like a normal teenager for once. I showed my mom my outfit - nothing inappropriate, but she immediately looked disgusted. She said it didn’t flatter me and that I’d “embarrass her.” It got to the point where she offered me $50 to change. I did it just to keep the peace, but that moment really stuck with me. It made me feel like who I was and how I wanted to express myself wasn’t good enough.

Fast forward to 2022. I started a new job and met a guy — I’ll call him “Goose.” He was transferred to my store for a bit, and over time, we got close. He’s calm, easygoing, we have ALOT in common, and he makes me feel safe and seen. I know some of you might raise an eyebrow, but there is an age gap — I was 19, and he was 32. I completely understand how that sounds, but I promise he’s never made me feel uncomfortable or pressured me in any way. We were upfront and honest about everything. It’s been four years now, and he’s never shown me a single red flag.

When my mom first met him, everything was fine. She even invited him inside (which is out of the ordinary for her) and was friendly. We all talked and joked around — it was actually nice. But the second he left, she completely flipped. She said she “felt it in her spirit” that he was going to hurt me or take advantage of me. That’s when everything started falling apart.

We argued constantly. She accused him of awful things without any reason. She tried to run background checks (which I did not mind), took pictures of his license plate, contacted his estranged family(WHICH I DO MIND! 🥲), tried to call the police on him (even though he did nothing wrong), and even tried to get both of us fired. She told my our family and family friends— which was humiliating because I’m a private person — and then relatives started calling to yell at me for “giving my mom a hard time.”

She would stay up all night crying, screaming, and telling me I’d ruined her life. I didn’t sleep for days and even passed out at work from exhaustion. Eventually, I couldn’t take it anymore, so I told her I broke up with him. She was upset but relieved. My dad knew we were still together but agreed it was probably best to let her believe that for a while.

A year later, she found out the truth and that was one of the scariest days of my life. Goose didn’t even want me to go home because he was afraid for me. Not to exaggerate but when she found out that I'm still dating him...I thought I was gonna die. Seriously, I thought she was going to kill me. I've never once in my life felt unsafe until that moment. I was so scared that I had to call my dad and beg him to come home. I almost called the police...it was a scary situation. She completely lost control that day. The house turned upside down, she threw everything, broke some things, she even threatened to punch my door down but that dooe was the only privacy I have so I had to open the door. (stupid, I know lol)

Somewhere along the way, I realized I had to choose between her and my sanity. I prayed about it, and I chose to stay with Goose,  not to hurt her, but because I finally realized I’ve spent my entire life trying to please her. I grew up thinking I couldn’t say no to anyone. But I couldn’t keep living like that. To this day I still have trouble to say ""no"".

We’ve been distant ever since. And even now, the arguments continue, it's small but constant. She’s accused me of stealing food to give to my boyfriend (which is ridiculous; I barely have time to cook because I work three jobs). She tells me that she has failed raising me and she’s disappointed in how I turned out because we “don’t have the same morals.” She thinks I’m partying or secretly doing sex work whenever I’m out late (I’m literally just at work). We argue about clothes, about everything.

I’ve tried to reconcile. I’ve invited her to watch TV, study the Bible, or just hang out, but she’s always not interested. And honestly, even when she does try to hang out with me, I’m scared of getting hurt again. And also, whenever she do want to hang out with me...its literally after a horrible argument! Like, lady can you give me a minute because the answer at the moment is ""no"" 🥲. And I still remember the nights of yelling, the guilt trips, the throwing things — staying up late just to make me feel bad. I’ve forgiven her for some of it, but not all of it. Not yet.

I think that’s why I feel so conflicted. I’m acting like everything’s okay when it’s not. I’m usually quick to forgive people, but with her, I can’t. And it hurts, because when she talks to coworkers or family, she brags about me saying that I’m the best daughter, that I work hard. Maybe she means it. Maybe she’s just putting on a front. But I can’t forget the things she’s said and done. They still hurt. And I don't know if it's true or not.

I want to forgive her one day. But I don’t know if I can yet. The trust just isn’t there. And honestly, I don’t even know if I want a relationship with her anymore.

So… am I the asshole for not wanting a relationship with my mom?

Thank you so much for reading all of this, I really appreciate it. Please be honest. I just need some outside perspective.

For context:

* Goose and I started dating when I was already an adult.
* I want to move out, but that’s not financially possible right now (thanks, economy 🙃).
* I don’t live with Goose — I’m waiting until marriage for that, for religious reasons.
* My dad knows everything and has been very supportive. He likes Goose and says as long as I’m being respected, that’s what matters.
* He even suggested therapy for my mom because of how extreme her reactions were, which only made her angrier. She’s even said she thought about divorcing my dad because he “took my side.”
* It’s been four years now. My mom is ""trying"" to accept it, but you can tell she’s still unsure. I’ve stopped trying to make her approve. At this point, I just want peace.",3,1761277228.0,ComfortLevelPod,1,1.0,False

I want honest feedback; if I'm in the wrong, feel free to roast me.

We have been married 4 years, together 6. We had a beautiful baby girl 2 months ago and I couldn't be happier. That being said, dealing with my wife during this time has been very difficult. I understand this is a difficult time for mother, but it's becoming very hard to deal with. When my wife gave birth she took mat leave and is off for a few more months. I run my own business so I only took 2 weeks off, however have a very flexible schedule. I can work at any time of day and only need about 4-5 hours a day to get done what I need to get done. Because of this flexibility, I offered to stay up with the baby every night and sleep on the couch so my wife could get a full night's rest every night. Essentially, I feed and change the baby when needed during the night and sleep while she sleeps. Luckily she sleeps pretty well, so it hasn't been all to bad. Plus due to my flexible schedule I can nap during the day if need be.

I hoped this would allow my wife to rest fully so the day would be easier for her. I will say she is an awesome mom and takes care of our little one better than I could've ever asked for. However, over the past month she has made daily complaints, often 5 plus a day, that I am not doing enough to help her. For context my typical day looks like this: Watch baby from 10 PM-8AM, then hand over to wife. If I got bad sleep I will sleep until about noon, but before I do I always make sure to have the baby fed, changed and have all bottles cleaned and ready to go, feed cat and make wife coffee. I work 4-5 hours a day between 1-8pm usually, often with gaps in the middle, in which I use that break to either clean up or take the baby so she gets a break. Wife cooks 5/7 days a week and I do dishes every night, as well as take out garbage/clean litter box every day. I watch the baby while she cooks. We take turns with laundry but she does most of the cleaning.  I will say she is also very on top of keeping the house stocked with the necessities, and that's probably something I could improve on.

Multiple times a day she will become easily agitated at the way I am ""holding the baby, feeding the baby, etc,"" and will intercept me and then do what she thinks should be done instead. She admits she's been harboring this resentment for having to do this, but in my opinion this is her own stress she is putting on herself. I have never put the baby in any kind of danger, and the only specifics she's given me is that I let milk get on the babie's clothes, which really bothers her. My wife is a very clean and orderly person, and I am not, but some of this seems obsessive. She gets really annoyed when there are any dishes in the sink, but has often complained that I make too much noise at night doing the dishes, so I don't know what to do. 

I realize mothers can become overly protective of babies when they are first born, but I feel watched every day. Any minor mistake I make in the way I hold, feed, change etc is criticized harshly; often raising her voice. I've had multiple conversations with her and sometimes it seems she understands but then continues to go back to berating me. I'm exhausted and worn down. I want to be as understanding as possible but I don't know what more I can do. When I try to do more she criticizes, so I pull back and then she criticizes me for that. I'm not looking for a pat on the back for just doing normal dad things, I know a lot of dads can be like that. I'm trying really hard and just want some appreciation. That being said please let me know if you think I could be doing more. Any advice would help.

* He even suggested therapy for my mom because of how extreme her reactions were, which only made her angrier. She’s even said she thought about divorcing my dad because he “took my side.”
* It’s been four years now. My mom is ""trying"" to accept it, but you can tell she’s still unsure. I’ve stopped trying to make her approve. At this point, I just want peace.",1,1761276901.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

1oenf5m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oenf5m,Libraries and Lunches in Chicago: Part 1,"Hello All!  Part of my job involves traveling around to visit different branches of Chicago Public Libraries. It's exciting to go to different neighborhoods in Chicago and see the local branches, and even more fun to find good food along the way.  So, I decided to share some of my visits with you all because there's so many great places in every neighborhood (and some great library branches, too).  Eventually I'll be visiting all 81 Branches. 

Here is the first batch of branches and lunches!

Visiting: West Loop  
Lunch: International McDonald's

We had to visit the International McDonald's, mainly because I've never been.  It's work checking out once in a while to see if you can get a McFlurry in some european candy bar, or maybe a Chicken Tikki sandwich. 

Did you know the West Loop branch won an award for it's design?  One of only 13 libraries currently with a Library of Things collection (you can rent out popcorn machines, a wagon, or camping chairs) it also has meeting rooms and a really lovely play area for kids in the children's section.     
\--

Library: Gage Park, West Englewood  
Coffee: Dolce Cafe Cubano  
Lunch: Carnitas Uruapan

Dolce Cafe Cubano was delicious -- they also gave me a little flower with my cold brew, which was adorable.  Carnitas Uruapan was delicious, so much food we barely finished.  Definitely a great value for the price, and it's just a few doors down from the Gage Park library branch.  

Gage Park has such a great storytime program for kids, and even though it's one of the smaller store-front libraries, they are so intentional about helping their community and providing programs for the neighborhood.

West Englewood not only has a lot of great programming for the community, but it also has a really beautiful reading garden outside!  Take a stroll through next time you're nearby.  
\--

Library: Legler & West Chicago  
Lunch: MacArthur's Restaurant

While MacAthur's is by no means a hidden gem, it's a classic for a reason.  Cafeteria style counter service, delicious meat and sides, it reminded me of home cooking (but someone else's home, because my mother couldn't cook like that).  You can see why it's an institution in the city.

Legler is one of the three Regional Branch Libraries here in the city!  Did you know they take clothing donations, which are avaiable to the public to take as they need?  They also recently partnered with Greater Chicago Food Depository to open up a food pantry!  Community members can come by the 3rd Saturday of the month.  
\--

Library: Austin-Irving, Dunning  
Lunch: Mr. D's Shishkabob

Mr. D's was completely worth the trip.  I got a polish and my coworker got a steak sandwich.  The fries were so perfect -- it's cash only and the diviest of dives, but the owner and his wife are so lovely and the food can't be beat.  

Austin-Irving has a local crochet group that meets weekly!

Dunning also has a small reading garden and a library of things.  Kids can check out basketballs to use at the nearby court!  
\--

Library: Woodson, Coleman  
Lunch: Daley's 

We couldn't be across the street from Daley's and not visit.  I got a steak sandwich and it was so delicious.  I actually ended up bringing half of it home and enjoyed it for dinner.

Woodson is another Regional Branch Library here in Chicago!  They celebrated their 50th anniversary this year, and are home of the Vivian G. Harsh Collection which is the largest African American history and literature collection in the midwest.  The lobby of the archives has a really gorgeous sculture by Richard Hunt.

The Coleman Library of course is named for Bessie Coleman, the first African-American woman and first Native-American to have a pilot's license.  They have a room dedicated to her with a lot of memorabilia and picture of this pioneer of aviation.  
\--

Library: Brighton Park, Back of the Yards  
Coffee: Sputnik Coffee  
Lunch: Birriera Y Taqueria El Arandas 

Brighton Park has some beautiful banners along the ceiling that have been made by their community.

Back of the Yards is actually connected to a school!  This unique location has a lot of programming and resources for kids and teens.  
\--

Library: Hegewisch  
Breakfast: Old Fashioned Donuts  
Lunch: Hienie's

While not particularly close to Hegewisch, we couldn't resist stopping by Old Fashioned Donuts on our way down to visit.  Another cornerstone of Chicago, you can watch them making the donuts every day and they're as classic as they are delicious.  

We also went by Hienie's on our way back north and had to stop in.  The fried chicken was so delicious, and their golden sauce is hot and savory -- but make sure you have napkins and wet wipes handy.  It's a commitment.

Hegewisch was one of our first libraries to check out fishing poles to the community.  If you're nearby, their newer building has some beautiful windows and will always have a puzzle out that the community works on.  Their most recent one took over 6 months to finish!

\--

Library: Little Italy  
Lunch: Conte Di Savoia

Another no-fuss counter service gem, the sandwiches are so good and they even hand fill canolis to order.

Little Italy's newer library is stunning.  They have a great section for teens and children, and even host weekly mahjong games for community members.  This is one of the more unique, picturesque locations that's definitely worth a visit. 

That's it for now!  

First Picture:  
  
Top Row, L to R: Raclette (International McDonalds), Carnitas ""Especial"" (Carnitas Uruapan), Fried Chicken, Roast Beef, Mac & Cheese, Mashed Potatoes (MacArthur's)

Middle Row, L to R: Polish with Grilled Onions (Mr. D's Shishkabob), Steak Sandwich (Daleys), Birriera (Birriera Y Taqueria El Arandas)

I had to adjust my availability slightly at the coffee shop so I could also work the 2nd job. I questioned my boss about my lack of hours and she completely cut my hours and said they will go to the new baristas because I “chose” this 2nd job. I had talked to her about the 2nd job before I ever accepted the offer and she said to do whatever. Would it be considered retaliation if she completely cut my hours due to a 2nd job? It didn’t state anywhere in the employee handout that I couldn’t have another job and numerous other baristas have in the past. I’m just asking to see if there’s any complaint of any sort I can file against her? It feels incredibly unfair to cut my hours for this reason.  ,3,1761276508.0,AskLegal,1,1.0,False

1oence2,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1oence2/my_grossly_unpopular_opinion_about_pour_overs/,My GROSSLY unpopular opinion about pour overs.,"I found an appreciation for coffee during covid trying to maximize the home experience by buying into hobbies I already enjoyed. I bought every accoutrement a budding coffee brewer could desire in yearn to perfect my pour over recipe/technique/grind/temperature control/etc. I eventually found my stride, as many in this subreddit have their own, hitting cup notes ranging all across the universe of the coffee flavor spectrum. I've shared cups so phenomenal, you'd swear you're drinking fruit juice. Pour overs opened my eyes. They were my meditative morning retreat where, for the next few groggy minutes, my attention belonged to nothing else except to this craft, this chase for perfection, and the fruit of its labor: the coffee. 

Though, the journey upward was definitely not a peach party...there were also dark moments. Frustrating acidity, maddening obsessions of particle size, begging drawdown times...There were days where, on paper, I supposedly performed everything to the exact standard and specification of everyone else's miraculously life changing cups, and all I was met with upon first sip was swill of which I wouldn't be caught dead serving to other people. And thinking back, while I learned to tweak and twist and tune, there was something about pour overs I couldn't shake off. I come from a chemistry background and ended up practicing healthcare so I know my way around a wet lab. To be honest with you, I should have gave in to my intuition sooner. 

Please forgive my following conviction, as I understand that i'm essentially poopoo-ing on some people's 10,000-hour class masteries. I promise am no larger of an authority as the next guy, so please feel free to shit on this opinion as much as you'd like because if I was in your shoes i'd probably do the same:

Pour overs are simply...a-scientific. 

Brewing coffee is just a chemical extraction. If you asked a chemist to extract anything else and showed them a V60, they’d laugh. It makes no sense... An open bottom, constant refilling, endless variables. Sure, fresh water matters, but the method introduces chaos disguised as technique. A chemist would control the process. Not subject themselves to this sisyphean ritual chasing the “perfect” bloom, drawdown time, grind size, water temp, roast date, ground distribution, drip rate. All of this for what??? Extraction percentages? Do you really think that segmenting water into differently volumed installments can change the sweetness of coffee?

I think it's absurd and just astrology for coffee brewers.

  
I want to offer a reprieve though and communicate what i've found to be the best for coffee extraction. I hate to give the proverbial, I was doing it before it was cool, but alas, it's immersion brewing. Nothing comes close. Hario switch. Give it a shot, keep all your variables the same and only adjust grind size. Listen to no one else about a supposedly better techniques or more adequate ratios.

1oenc1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrowverse/comments/1oenc1o/au_story_the_violet_knight_part_3/,AU Story: The Violet Knight Part 3,"Gotham stadium the Knights team was getting ready for practice. Players, Media personnel  & fans that were attending saw Ellie's tricked out custom Toyota Supra with a purple body & gold rims with gold trim on its spoiler & splitter that was sitting in the parking lot. It wasn't something the public saw, as Ellie had been driving a black Mercedes around the city.

Players, Fans & Media people were taking videos & photographing the car. Then standing next to to the Knights Head Coach, another woman named Rebecca Chase was Ellie in her brightly comfortable clothes & her glasses which is another thing that the public hadn't seen about Ellie, she had been like her father, but now her she was smiling, laughing with coaches & players, dressed simply another fan.

The energy on the field was electric, buzzing less from the drills and more from the unusual sight of the owner, Ellie Wayne, casually interacting with players. Following practice, the media swarmed Head Coach Rebecca Chase and a couple of key players, their questions quickly pivoting from the upcoming game to the purple sports car and the smiling CEO.

​REPORTER 1: ""Coach Chase, we're all buzzing about the new car, the custom Supra, and, frankly, seeing Ms. Wayne out here laughing with the team. She's always been so private. What changed?""

​Coach Chase,,Smiling, a genuine warmth in her eyes?

""What changed is that she’s healing. Ellie is family. The last few years have been incredibly difficult. But seeing her here, in her favorite casual clothes, just being Ellie... it’s fantastic for the whole organization. This is a team built on community, and seeing our owner feeling comfortable enough to just be herself? That’s everything.""

​REPORTER 2: ""Speaking of her role, how is Ellie Wayne as an owner? Does she constantly intervene in draft decisions or cap space?""

​Coach Chase Chuckled.
""That's a great question, and it's where the public perception of 'Bruce Wayne's daughter' and the reality of 'Ellie Wayne' diverge. When she took over three years ago, I met with her and the GM, Kevin Stewart, in her office. She was 19 years old, less than a month out of high school, and she had just lost her father to cancer(the cover story). 

She looked me straight in the eye and said, 'I am overwhelmed running my father’s company, and I certainly can’t run a football team.' She straight-up told us she trusted our judgment, gave us the resources, and said, 'Your job is to run the team; mine is to keep the lights on.' She lets us do our jobs. She is a phenomenal, supportive, hands-off owner.""

​MARCUS ""MAC"" ALLEN (Knights Wide Receiver):
""It means a lot, but Mr. Wayne was like a ghost here. Ellie is different. She knows our names. She gave me a fist bump after I ran that route. Seeing her drive that Supra, it's wild, but it's her. It shows she's not just the stuffy billionaire they write about. She’s just a cool twenty-something who happens to own the team.”

The next one of the Sports Talks shows had a screen showing a split-image: Ellie's Supra and the smiling photo of her and Coach Chase. The table had five people sitting at it, the four hosts: two women and two men who were former players, then Ellie sat comfortably in between two of the hosts, she dressed smartly but casually in her purple long-sleeve shirt, black skirt, black sheer leggings, and purple heeled boots. She wore her glasses and radiated a calm maturity.

​Female Host #1 says, ""Welcome back, everyone. We are incredibly privileged tonight to be joined by the owner of the Gotham Knights, the remarkable Ellie Wayne. Ellie, thank you so much for being here. After what has been an incredibly difficult, private few years for you, how are you feeling and doing now?""


​Ellie leaned forward slightly, speaking with a clear, steady voice. ""I’m doing a lot better than what I was. When I turned 19 and graduated high school, I was excited about going to college, making friends, possibly meeting someone of any color of the rainbow. I didn’t exactly sign up to bury my dad, take over the biggest company in the world, take over the football team, and somehow find time to grieve. The grieving part took me about three years, but I did it. I’m good now.""

​Female Host #2 says, ""That context is vital, Ellie. Coach Chase spoke yesterday about your initial decision to completely delegate the team’s management to her and Kevin Stewart. That showed a huge degree of self-awareness and trust. Can you walk us through that decision process?""

​Ellie took a sigh, ""Yeah, it’s not complicated, honestly. My first day as the Team Owner, I basically called Kevin and Rebecca into my stadium office, which I didn’t even know I had and I straight up said, 'I’m overwhelmed. I don’t know what I’m doing. I need help.' I told them, 'You two run and manage the ship, and I’ll just make sure we have gas.' It’s the same approach I took with Wayne Enterprises. Lucius Fox, the Vice President, he was a great friend of my dad's, and I told him, 'I don't know how to do this.' And Lucius just said that he wasn't going anywhere. You have to trust the experts.""

​Former Player #1, Chuckled, leaning in)
""Moving to a more positive thing, let's talk about that car! The custom Supra! Where did that thing come from? That is not standard Wayne-issue transportation."" (The hosts laugh.)

​Ellie Smiling brightly,
""Oh, that thing. When I turned eighteen, my dad made his only bad money decision, which was giving an eighteen year old a sizable amount of liquid money. I immediately bought the car and spent loads on customizing it: the engine, the spoiler, the splitter, the rims, the midnight purple paint job. It was my way of rebelling.""

​Former Player #2 asked, ""And how did Bruce react to that particular purchase?""

​Ellie smiled and shakes her head, making the hosts laugh.
""Oh, he was mad. I was sitting on my bed playing Pokémon, and all of a sudden, I hear him stomping down the hallway about to bring the wrath of God down. My first thought was, 'How quickly can I get out of this room?' I won't repeat everything he said because it was not network friendly, but one thing he did yell at me was, 'Just because you have the money, doesn't mean you should spend it!' I learned my lesson, mostly.""

​Female Host #1 smiling, ""Before we wrap, we have to touch on the photos that came out showing you and Sara Lance. It’s been described as a secret bond. What type of relationship do you two have?""

​Ellie's smile softens, becoming genuinely moved.
""Sara was a friend of my dad’s money-argument-shouting partner, Oliver Queen. My dad was hosting a big gala at the manor, both Oliver and Sara came. Sara got bored with the party and went wandering around. She found little nine year old me playing in my room, and it was an instant connection. I didn't want her to leave, so Dad, maybe secretly hoping for some peace and quiet, hired her to be my nanny.""

​""But it changed one night. During the first year, there was a bad thunderstorm. I woke up scared, grabbed my Pokémon plushies as comfort items, and went into Sara’s room. I was crying, telling her the storm scared me. She didn’t just tell me to go back to bed; she comforted me, held me until I was calm. And from that night onwards, Sara wasn't a nanny, a caretaker, she was Mom.”

​On Friday Night, inside Ellie’s massive bedroom were multiple pizza boxes and two-liter bottles of soda were spread across a low table next to a large gaming screen. Ellie, wearing a purple tank top, light blue Flash pajamas, and pink ankle socks, she was currently lounging on the bed. 

Kara, meanwhile, was exploring the incredible walk-in closet, a look of wide-eyed disbelief on her face. Kara called from the closet, ""Seriously, this closet is bigger than my entire apartment. Wait, no, it's bigger than my sister's apartment.""

​Kara pushed aside a row of sleek jackets and gasped softly, spotting a pair of red pajama shorts with the familiar Supergirl S-shield logo embroidered discreetly near the hem. Kara exited the closet, holding the shorts up, her cheeks flushed with playful surprise.

​Kara with a giddy smile, ""You like me!"" she said teasingly.

​Ellie laughed, then, seeing the perfect opportunity for playful revenge, slid off the bed. She walked toward Kara with a confident smirk, embracing her newfound, public self-assurance.

​Ellie smirked, ""Ya know."" She leaned in close, “I never realized how hot & sexy you are Kara.” She finished, then gave Kara a quick kiss on the lips and then pulling back. Kara was completely flustered, her teasing attempt utterly reversed by Ellie's sudden boldness.

Kara cleared her throat, quickly pulling on the shorts and pairing them with a light blue tank top, ""O-okay! We should definitely get back to watching the TV. The pizza is getting cold.""

​Ellie changed instantly back to her bubbly, sweet self, ""You're right! To the soda!""

​For the next few hours, the heroes dove into the world of video games. Ellie, with infectious enthusiasm, guided Kara through the complexities of the Pokémon universe.

​""Okay, so there are different types, like Fire, Water, Grass, and they all counter each other. And the best part? You can only have a team of six Pokémon at a time. It’s all about balance."" Ellie said, excitedly.

​Kara was quickly drawn into the strategy and the sheer variety of creatures. She poured over the game's encyclopedia, occasionally asking Ellie to show her specific Pokémon. By the end of the night, Kara had proudly chosen her six favorites, a team that balanced grace, power, and unusual charm: Empoleon, Alolan Ninetales, Espeon, Dragonite, Hisuian Arcanine, and Gourgeist.

​They finally crashed on Ellie's bed, with empty pizza boxes crammed into a garage can and the soft glow of the television, laughing until they finally drifted off to sleep.

​The next morning, dressed in casual clothes, Ellie led Kara into the vast, museum-like Manor Garage. They walked past several classic vehicles until they reached the low, sleek profile of the customized Toyota Supra.

​Kara Whistling softly, ""Wow. It looks even better in person. The purple almost looks black in this light.""

​Ellie walking around to the driver's side, running a hand across the spoiler, ""Yeah, this is my baby.""

​Kara chucked at the royal purple body, gold trim, and matching rims. ""It's very Batgirl.""

​Ellie grinned ""It would be weird if it wasn't.""

​The women got into the car. Ellie opened the garage door, then turned the ignition. The engine revved with a powerful, hungry snarl, and the gold-colored interior lights, mirrored by the undercarriage lights, pulsed to life. Ellie let out a whoop of joy, laughing and bouncing in her seat, a pure, unadulterated expression of happiness Kara hadn't seen before.

​Ellie hit the gas, the car rocketing out of the garage. She performed a perfect, tight turn, closing the door as they cleared it, and they were gone.

​Ellie drove through Gotham with quickness and agility, weaving seamlessly through traffic. Kara, used to flying, was surprised by the sheer speed and control. 

Not once did Ellie break the speed limit, yet they moved with the focused intensity of a well-executed plan. Their first stop was a boutique in an upscale district, where Ellie insisted Kara get whatever she liked, leading to a giddy hour of trying on clothes. Next, they visited a video game store. In addition to a couple of new games for the evening, Ellie bought plushies of the six Pokémon Kara had chosen for her team, wrapping them as an early best-friend present.

​They rounded out the afternoon with a matinee movie, and for dinner, they stopped at a popular, regular restaurant, nothing fancy, just a place for two young women to share burgers and fries. Ellie drove them back to Wayne Manor after dinner. Kara retrieved her bags and the stack of plushies from the trunk.

​Kara was smiling and holding the bags with her new clothes & plushies, ""This was... this was the best weekend I've had in ages, Ellie. Thank you for wanting to spend it with me.""

​Ellie gave Kara a big hug & sincerely said, ""I've always wanted a best friend. And now I have one.""

​With a final, warm hug, Kara ascended toward the sky, leaving Ellie standing in the glow of the Supra's gold lights, smiling up at her friend.

The following evening the next day, Sara & Ava invited Kara & Alex to the condo for dinner after seeing photos & videos of Ellie & Kara people took. Sara, Ava, Kara, and Alex were gathered around the dining table. Plates of pasta were being passed, and the conversation was relaxed, a welcome break from tracking a super-thief.

​Sara Setting down the garlic bread? ""I saw the photos, Kara. You two were all over the Gotham social feeds. The Supra, the shopping bags, the giggling over plushies... It genuinely looked like two normal people having a normal day, which is exactly what she needed.""

​Kara grinned, ""It was great! Honestly, Ellie is just… pure joy when she's not wearing the cowl. We ate so much pizza and soda Friday night, I thought I was going to lose my flight speed.""

​Alex smiled, ""She deserves it. Seeing her loosen up like that, drive that ridiculously expensive purple car, is honestly the best evidence we have that the mission is working. She’s stable.""

​""So, what exactly happens at a slumber party for two superheroes? I'm picturing a very complicated game of Truth or Dare."" Ava asked.

​Kara with a small wave of her hand, ""Oh, no, it was mostly Pokémon. Ellie is obsessed. She spent an hour teaching me about type advantages and why her Charizard plushie is superior. But the best part was the clothes. She was wearing these ridiculous light blue pajamas with Flash logos on them...""

​Kara paused, an amused smirk playing on her lips.""And then I found a pair of red pajama shorts in her closet with my symbol on them. So, obviously, I came out, teasing her, 'You like me!'""

​Sara leaned forward, sensing the shift in the story’s energy, ""And then what? You broke her brain with the truth?""

​Kara chuckled nervously, swirling the sauce on her plate. ""Well, she got her revenge, she just hopped off the bed, walked right up to me, and got incredibly confident. She was standing really close, and she was doing that intense, focused thing that she does...""

​""The 'Bat-Stare'?"" Ava asked, Intrigued.

""Worse. She said, 'Ya know,' all quiet and seductive,'I never realized how hot and sexy you are, Kara.' And then she just... she kissed me. And then she smiled and walked away to the TV, like she’d just tied her shoe."" Kara answered.

​The air around the table instantly froze. Alex dropped her fork onto the plate with a loud clink, ""Wait. She did what?""

​Ava's eyes wide, looking from Kara to Sara, a slow smile starting to form. ""Ellie kissed you?""

​Sara was completely stunned, trying to process this blend of familial pride and parental panic, ""She... she called the Girl of Steel 'hot and sexy,' and then kissed her? On the lips? In her Flash pajamas?"" Sara ran a hand through her hair, a stunned laugh escaping her. ""That is the most audacious thing she’s ever done. My God, she's certainly not Bruce's daughter.""

​Kara got flustered again, ""I was a disaster! I was completely red! I just stuttered, 'W-we should get back to watching TV!'""

​Alex shook her head in impressed disbelief, ""I need to lie down. That girl is going to be trouble. But honestly, good for her. She shot her shot.""

​Ava laughing, raising her glass, ""To Batgirl, who just grounded a Kryptonian. She learned that move from you, Sara. You always go for the unexpected high-ground move.""

​Sara finally smiled, leaning back, shaking her head. ""I am going to have to have a talk with her about workplace conduct... and dating. But for now... I'm just proud of my little bold Bat.”

Next morning, Ellie was at her desk, radiating confidence in a sharp, hot pink pantsuit, accented by a light blue sequined top and matching flats. Her glasses, now a permanent feature of her public look, framed her smiling face. The moment the door opened, she was on her feet.

​""Hey, Mom!"", ​Ellie ran around the desk and gave Sara a huge, enthusiastic hug.

​Sara chuckling, returning the squeeze, ""Nice to see you, Cubbie. You clean up well. That suit is something else.”

​Ellie brooke the hug and doing a little spin, ""Thanks! Got it with Kara! What brings the Mama Bear to the corporate jungle?""

​Ellie settled back into her executive chair, leaning forward excitedly, while Sara took a seat in the plush leather chair opposite the desk.

​""I came to talk about your weekend with Kara."" Sara answered.

​Ellie immediately broke into a wide, unapologetic grin. ""Oh, yeah! My weekend with the hot and super sexy blonde babe with legs for days! What about it?""

​Sara was completely caught off guard by the blunt, almost aggressive confidence, pausing for a moment while Ellie watched her, smirking.

​Sara Recovering quickly, ""Yes, that weekend. You know I love that you're happy, but I heard some of the details second-hand, and I wanted to check in.""

​Ellie grinned, ""Oh, it was perfect. We had a slumber party, ate pizza, drank way too much soda, and played Pokémon, which, by the way, I got her hooked on; mission accomplished there. Then we went clothes shopping where I got this pantsuit, ain't it cute? Then a movie, dinner. And before she left, I told her I always wanted a best friend.""

​Sara was genuinely touched by the sincerity of the last sentence, but then she remembered her mission.

​""I believe the best friend part, Ellie. I really do. But is it just friends with Kara, because she also told us that... you kissed her.""

​Ellie simply shrugged, reaching for a stress ball shaped like a football on her desk. ""Well, you gotta shoot your shot, right? And if there's a Super Babe standing right there in your bedroom wearing your pajamas, you gotta go for it! It was either that or burst into flames from all the repressed feelings.""

​Sara just stared at her daughter for a moment, a mix of disbelief and intense pride washing over her.

​Sara laughed and shook her head, ""You are definitely not Bruce's daughter. Okay, Cubbie. Point taken.""

​Later that afternoon, Sara was back on the Waverider, recapping the exchange for Ava and Nate, who were sharing a bag of chips in the lounge.

​""So you asked her about the kiss, and she confirmed it?"" Ava asked.

​""She confirmed it, Ava, and then some. I went in trying to be the measured, concerned parent, and she blindsided me with confidence. She called Kara the 'hot and sexy super blonde babe with legs for days.'"" Sara answered.

​Nate nearly choked on a chip, ""Wait, Ellie Wayne, the quiet, glasses-wearing CEO, said that? That's amazing. That's a legend in the making.”

​Ava Smiled broadly, ""Sara, that's your spirit, wrapped in a Batgirl cowl and a pink pantsuit. She's learning from the best. But what about the 'friend' part?""

​Sara smiled, ""That’s the complex bit. She said she always wanted a best friend, and she considers Kara that. But then she justified the kiss by saying, 'Well, you gotta shoot your shot, right?' She’s clearly interested, but she’s giving Kara an easy out by leaving it at 'friendship' for now. It’s mature, terrifyingly bold, and just utterly sweet.""

​""So, the Batgirl has a crush on Supergirl. This simplifies nothing, but it makes the next mission infinitely more interesting."" Nate said.

​Sara stepped away to a quiet corner of the bridge and called Kara.

​Kara over the comms, sounding relieved, ""Hey Sara! Did you talk to her? Is she mad about me telling you?""

​Sara softly laughing, ""Mad? Kara, she's radiating. I went in to check on her, and she was wearing a blinding pink pantsuit, and she called you the 'hot and sexy super blonde babe with legs for days.'""

​Kara let out a small, surprised squeak. ""Oh my god. She actually said that?""

​""She did. And when I asked why she kissed you, she just shrugged and said, 'Well, ya gotta shoot your shot, right? And if there's a Super Babe standing in your bedroom, you gotta go for it!'"" Sara laughed.

​Kara with a mix of embarrassment and happiness, ""Wow. Okay. So... that means she was serious.""

​Sara exhaled, ""She was serious. She also said she's always wanted a best friend, and she genuinely means that, too. She's putting her true feelings out there without any pressure. You two are a fantastic duo, Kara. Just… take it slow. And maybe keep the expensive pajamas locked up when she visits.""

​Kara chuckles, ""Deal. Thanks, Sara. It helps to know where her head's at.""

​Sara smiled, ""Anytime. Now, focus up. We still have a Red X problem, and we need to get Cisco that Harmonic Override Generator (H.O.G.) built. If he moves again, we need to be ready to disable that QFS.”

On a Friday night, the Supra, a blur of royal purple and shining gold interior & undercarriage lights, cut through the darkness. Inside, Ellie Wayne was the picture of reckless freedom: she wore her pajamas & bunny slippers. The radio was blasting an upbeat track, and the engine let out a sharp, snarling roar every time Ellie shifted, the sound a physical expression of her joy.

​Ellie wasn’t breaking the speed limit, but her quickness and agility were shocking to the few other cars on the road. She carved through traffic with an expert confidence that belied her silly attire, leaving a shimmering gold-lit rocket ship in her wake. Other drivers leaned on their horns, staring in disbelief at the glimpse of a person moving with racecar precision.

​She crossed out of New Jersey, skirted the lower highways of New York, and finally merged onto the back roads of Massachusetts that led to Blüdhaven. ​Arriving at Titans Tower, Ellie pulled up to the secured perimeter gate. She leaned over, punched in a quick, practiced code on the internal pad, and the steel barriers slid open instantly. Inside the massive, concrete garage, she maneuvered the Supra neatly into an open bay, parking it beside Victor's high-tech silver & blue Dodge Challenger he nicknamed the T-Car.

​Ellie powered down the Supra. The gold lights winked out, and the silence was deep. She climbed out, grabbing her purple-cased phone, a small bottle of soda, and a purple duffle bag stuffed with clothes. She walked through the quiet halls of the Tower.

​She located the dedicated bedroom the team kept stocked for her. With a deep sigh of contentment, she tossed the duffle bag to the floor, kicked off her slippers, set her phone and glasses on the side table, and collapsed into the welcoming bed, instantly falling into a deep sleep.

​The next day the early morning air in the communal living space usually smelled of stale coffee and gym equipment, but this morning, something was different.

​Victor was walking toward the kitchen, rubbing sleep from his human eye.

""Did Kori start a new synthetic protein block? What is that smell?""

​Gar transformed from a green tabby cat into his human form, rubbing his stomach. ""Smells like... actual good food. Whose cooking? Is it an intruder?""

​Rachel walked with calm, dispassionate dread, ""What intruder bothers to make pancakes?""

​The five Titans walked into the brightly lit kitchen area. They stopped dead, their sleepiness replaced by utter surprise.Standing at the massive stove, efficiently flipping a stack of golden brown pancakes, was Ellie, she was smiling warmly, completely at ease.

​Ellie Beaming, spatula in hand, ""Hey guys! Hope you don't mind that I dropped by! I needed a change of scenery and the Supra was begging for a run. Anyway, is anyone hungry? I made blueberry and chocolate chip pancakes.""

​Ellie indicated the mountain of pancakes, bowls of fruit, and a freshly brewed pot of coffee. The Titans stared at their surprise houseguest, the most important CEO in the world, making breakfast in their kitchen like a slightly awkward, but deeply welcome, younger sister.

Dick rubbed the sleep from his eyes, leaning against the counter next to Kori, who was already glowing with warmth. They, along with Victor, Gar, and Rachel, were staring at Ellie as she expertly flipped a blueberry pancake.

​Gar sniffed the air dramatically, ""Definitely not an intruder. The mix maple syrup and butter is too pure. Ellie, what are you doing here? Not that we mind, but shouldn't you be, like, testifying before Congress or something?""

​Ellie, smiling, slid a stack of pancakes onto a plate, ""Morning, Gar. No subpoenas today. I just woke up yesterday and realized I hadn't seen my best friends in too long, and the Supra was begging for a proper run. She gets restless sitting in the Manor garage. Figured I'd stop by for the weekend and annoy you all.""

​Dick walked over to hug her, his voice warm, ""You could never annoy us, El. But seriously, a midnight run from Gotham? Are you doing okay? No, scratch that, you seem happier than I've ever seen you.""

​Ellie smiled, ""I am. Way better. Having Mom back helps. Getting all the truth out. the funeral, the grief, the company, it just left me feeling lighter. The only way to celebrate was to put on my bunny slippers and drive fast until I smelled the ocean air.""

​Victor poured a cup of coffee, nodding toward the car, ""The Supra looks incredible. I saw the telemetry spike when you entered the perimeter. How was the ride? Did you push the twin-turbo?""

​Ellie beamed, ""It was amazing! It's so responsive! I was dodging traffic like I was running a Bat-scramble, but I never once went over the limit, Vic. Bruce's training kicked in. It's exhilarating all the speed, none of the speeding ticket hassle. Want to take a look at the custom exhaust manifold after breakfast?""

​Victor grinned, ""Absolutely.""

​Rachel took a plate of pancakes, deadpan,""She drove three states away in pajamas and bunny slippers to make us breakfast. This is the new baseline for Ellie, It’s strangely wholesome.""

​Kori sat down, smiling affectionately, ""It is very wholesome. And very brave. It takes great strength to choose joy, Ellie. We are all so proud of you. And, as a friend, I must ask……does your happiness involve a certain reporter from National City?""

​Ellie’s cheeks flushed, but she didn’t back down. Shrugging, trying to look casual, ""Kara? Yeah, she's great. We had a fun weekend. I taught her about Pokémon. I got her hooked. She’s definitely going to need my help setting up her team.""

​Gar got excited, ""Wait, is she a Super Babe and a Pokémon trainer now?! That's awesome!""

​Dick gave Ellie a knowing look, ""I think Kori was referring to the part where you 'shot your shot' and delivered a very memorable kiss to her.'""

​Ellie leaned against the counter, crossing her arms, unrepentant.

​""Well, you guys taught me to be decisive, right? And she's got that wonderful, soft golden retriever energy. I'm used to sharp edges. It's a nice change. Anyway, less talking about my burgeoning social life, more eating! We've got a Supra to inspect, and I want a rematch in Mario Kart!”

The lingering scent of blueberry pancakes hung in the air, a domestic comfort that contrasted sharply with the high-tech surroundings. Ellie, Victor, Gar, and Rachel were sprawled on the massive circular couch in front of the floor-to-ceiling monitor. Rachel was quietly immersed in a book, while the other three were deep into a chaotic, multi-player video game session. Gar’s triumphant shouts and Victor’s calculated maneuvers filled the space.

​Ellie laughed brightly, hitting a button, ""Take that, Vic! That's the power of the Hisuian Arcanine! You thought I was talking about Pokémon just for fun? It was reconnaissance!""

​Victor annoyed, ""You cheated! You distracted me by talking about a new Supra chip upgrade! That is highly unethical, Wayne!""

​Dick leaned against the kitchen counter with Kori, ""Look at her, Kori. Seriously, look.""

​Kori's expression was soft, watching Ellie laugh, ""She is beautiful, Dick. There is a lightness to her essence that was not there before. The burden is gone.""

​”It is. I keep thinking back to that night, the fear toxin, the plan to lock herself in Arkham, essentially choosing to destroy her own mind because she thought she was too dangerous. Sara saved her, not just from the toxin, but from three years of self-imprisonment. That one moment of maternal connection changed everything."" said Dick.

​Kori put a hand on Dick's shoulder, ""It is wonderful to see the bond that they formed in those memories finally allowed to exist in the daylight. She has a mother who fought for her. Now she has friends who are here for her.""

​A high-pitched, insistent alarm suddenly shattered the peaceful morning. The screen that moments before had displayed bright video game graphics instantly switched to a holographic 3D map of Blüdhaven, flashing a red alert icon over the city’s historic district.

​Rachel closed her book, ""That’s the Blüdhaven Museum. High-value asset theft in progress.""

​The lighthearted mood vanished instantly, replaced by professional urgency. Ellie sprang off the couch, her face snapping into the focused determination that Dick knew so well.

​Ellie's face went serious, ""That's close. Too close for coincidence.""

​""No time for coffee. Suit up. Let's move!"" Dick commanded.

​Minutes later, the six heroes arrived at the museum. The main vault entrance was scarred by precision cuts, and the building was silent save for the dripping of shattered sprinkler heads. The team moved quickly into the main Egyptian exhibit hall. Amidst the overturned pedestals and shattered glass, a figure stood near the empty space where the famed Pharaoh’s Ruby once rested.

​The figure turned, holding the glittering artifact, it was Selina, but she was wearing a suit the heroes had never seen before. Gone was the sleek, black leather; this was a formidable, midnight purple armored suit, detailed with segmented plates and high-tech seams, and the cowl was accentuated by large, electric blue lenses that glowed menacingly.

​Dick his voice tight with disbelief, stepping forward, ""Selina. You’re wearing... armor?""

​Selina's voice was filtered through the suit’s modulator, cold and indifferent. ""An upgrade, Richard. After my recent memory issues, I decided to invest in better security. This keeps the little voices out."" She tilted her head, her blue lenses fixing on Ellie. ""And speaking of security... a little Wayne brat stealing my old color scheme. Adorable.""

​Ellie stood rigid, the shock hitting her hard. This was not the broken woman from the memories, this was a dangerous, equipped criminal? ""You won't get far with that, Selina.""

​Selina dropped into a crouch, ready to fight? ""Oh, darling, I always get far. Especially now that I have the resources to buy proper technology, instead of scavenging in the dumps.""

​Before the Titans could react, Selina activated a powerful wrist-mounted cable launcher, latching onto a ceiling beam.

​""Titans, take her down! Batgirl, watch out!"" Dick called out.

​The fight was on, pitting the Titans against a surprisingly armored and vicious Catwoman. This was no ordinary heist; this was a confrontation between a newly formed mother-daughter unit and the biological mother who was now a high-tech threat.

​The air crackled with tension as the six heroes faced the armored figure. Selina Kyle's new midnight purple armor was menacing, its glowing blue lenses fixing squarely on Ellie.

​Dick, took a fighting stance, ""Titans, non-lethal, but treat her like a live wire. Starfire, try to disarm her!""

​""Understood, Dick!"" Kori launched a powerful torrent of starbolts at Selina.

​Catwoman didn’t flinch, the bolts impacted the purple chest plate, and instead of exploding, the armor glowed briefly, absorbing and dissipating the kinetic energy with a faint, metallic hum.

​Selina smirked with, ""Too much raw power, Koriand’r. Bruce always prepared for the big guns. That armor has a lead-composite lining and kinetic dampeners.""

​""Running counter-hack! That suit shouldn't be able to shrug off a Type-7 blast, it’s too advanced."" Victor's arm transformed, firing a quick-burst EMP intended to scramble her network.

​Selina dodged the pulse with grace, ""Analog network, Vic. Or do you think Bruce would really risk his most valuable information on something that could be hacked by a talking toaster oven?""

​Gar transforms into a massive, green Rhino and charges at Selina. ""Stop talking and start running, Cat!""

​Selina pivoted instantly. From her shoulder plate, a small, disc-shaped device deployed, emitting a targeted sonic pulse tuned to a high frequency. The sound was inaudible to the others, but Gar instantly collapsed, clutching his head, forcing him to painfully revert to human form.

​Selina chuckled, ""A little frequency disruption. Bruce always said a shapeshifter’s greatest weakness is the instability of constant molecular restructuring.""

​Rachel got frustrated, her eyes glowing with dark energy, ""Your mind is closed!"" She projected a wave of empathetic darkness toward Selina, aiming to overwhelm her with emotion.

​""And yours is predictable, Rachel."" Selina taunted, her blue lenses intensified, and the armor's helmet emitted a faint, static hiss, a psychic white-noise generator. ""Bruce didn't trust magic, but he knew exactly how to make a witch go silent.""

​Dick realized the terrifying truth: this wasn't just Selina. She was operating with Bruce's countermeasures, designed to disable every hero in the room.

""Batgirl, stick to hand-to-hand! She's countering all our abilities!""

​Selina laughed, a grating sound through the modulator, and launched a grappling hook directly at a nearby pillar. She swung, kicking Dick and Kori away, creating space to isolate her true target: Ellie.

​Selina slammed Ellie backward against a stone pedestal, the armor pressing hard into Ellie's chest. The blue lenses stared into the white eyes of the cowl.

​Selina's voice dripped with venomous familiarity, ""Look at you. Wearing the colors, trying to be the hero. So you've replaced me with that bird? The loud, messy one? Sara Lance? Do you think she can teach you anything about control?""

​Ellie tore her cowl off, revealing her furious face.
​""Well, it wasn't hard, since you cared more about stealing than the little girl you helped create!"" With a powerful shove fueled by three years of suppressed rage, Ellie managed to push the armored Selina backward.

​Ellie stood up straight, trembling, her voice cracking with pure, unadulterated pain as she continued the verbal assault. ""All you did was send birthday and Christmas cards once in a while! I needed a mother who actually wanted to take care of me! Sara was that person! She made sure I was okay when I had a nightmare, she played with me whenever I asked, she would read me stories, she helped me through puberty, and most of all, the night that Dad died, Sara saved me from painting the Arkham walls red!""

​Ellie took a heaving breath, the final words a scream that echoed off the high ceiling. ""Sara's my real mother, while you, Selina, were just the egg donor!""

​Selina was momentarily stunned by the sheer, brutal honesty. The blue lenses seemed to flicker, and a genuine, unarmored flash of pain crossed her visible face before the modulator snapped back into control.

""You think that changes anything?""
​Selina reached behind her, tossing the Pharaoh’s Ruby high into the air as a distraction. As the Titans instinctively looked up, Selina deployed a cluster of miniature flash-bangs and launched a specialized escape wire into the ceiling vent. The explosions momentarily blinded the heroes.

​When the smoke cleared, Selina was gone, and the Titans were left with the stolen artifact lying harmlessly on the ground, a cynical joke.

​""She’s gone! Did anyone get a tracker on her?"" Dick asked.

​""No. The EMP didn't even phase her. That tech is custom. Bruce-level custom."" Victor answered.

​Ellie, still breathing hard, stared at the spot where Selina had stood. The adrenaline faded, replaced by crushing, overwhelming emotion. Her legs buckled, and she fell to her knees. Whispering, tears streaming down her face, ""The egg donor... I just called her the egg donor...""

​Kori rushed forward instantly, shedding her battle readiness for maternal comfort. She knelt and pulled Ellie into a tight, warm embrace. ""Hey. Hey, it's okay, little one. You said what you needed to say. She heard you. You told your truth.""

Since its establishment in 2016, this enterprise rooted at Sinan Logistics City, No. 10 Ximahu Ring Road, Simao District, has not only opened up an efficient transportation channel for local enterprises but also become an important link connecting southwest China with neighboring countries, relying on its unique geographical location and diversified services.

https://preview.redd.it/9y2nqghl9zwf1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=301a5f3599f0f4bb861c58bc65a55648de815575

As the economic and cultural center of Pu'er City, Simao District has strong logistics demand. The transportation network around Ximahu Ring Road is known as a ""logistics golden circle"" — dense highway trunks radiate across the province, connecting northward to Kunming and Sichuan, and southward to quickly link with the China-Laos Railway and border ports, paving a convenient way for cross-border cargo transportation. Pu'er Nandun Logistics deeply understands the value of geographical advantages. By setting its headquarters here, it can not only quickly respond to the immediate needs of local enterprises but also rely on the extensive road network to achieve efficient distribution of goods to Southeast Asian countries. This ""internal and external linkage"" location dividend has enabled the enterprise to have dual potential in serving the regional economy and cross-border trade since its establishment.

Led by its person in charge, Ye Zhiwen, this professional team of 30 people has built a full-chain service system covering transportation, warehousing, and supply chain management. The transportation fleet is equipped with various types of vehicles such as box trucks and refrigerated trucks, which can meet the transportation needs of different goods including agricultural products, electronic products, and fresh food. The modern warehousing facilities realize precise cargo control through an intelligent management system, which is especially suitable for local characteristic products such as Pu'er tea and tropical fruits that require special storage conditions. More importantly, the company uses a real-time logistics information system to plan the optimal route and combines it with cargo tracking services, allowing customers to keep track of the cargo dynamics throughout the process — this detail is exactly the ""sense of security"" that customers value most in cross-border logistics.

In recent years, with the increasing trade between China and Southeast Asian countries, the value of Pu'er Nandun Logistics has become more prominent. Relying on Pu'er's position as an important node in Yunnan's radiation center facing South and Southeast Asia, the company not only supports local enterprises in transporting characteristic products such as tea and coffee to neighboring countries but also provides convenience for the warehousing and distribution of imported goods. Ye Zhiwen said, ""The essence of logistics is connection. What we need to do is to make this connection more efficient and reliable, so that high-quality products from Pu'er can go out and high-quality goods from abroad can come in."" 

From serving the local area to connecting cross-border trade, Pu'er Nandun Logistics is writing its own story in the regional logistics landscape with professionalism and integrity. This place is not only a transit station for goods but also a ""bridge"" for Sino-foreign trade. With a continuous enterprising attitude, it is injecting a steady stream of momentum into the economic interaction between Yunnan and the world.",1,1761275977.0,u_Little_Case_613,0,1.0,False

The Annual Startup Martinsville-Henry County Awards event was held Tuesday, and 16 new businesses were awarded nearly $69,000 in funding.

Startup Martinsville-Henry County is an eight-week entrepreneurial boot camp program for new businesses in Martinsville and Henry County, administered by the Martinsville-Henry County Chamber of Commerce’s Charitable Affiliate, the Chamber’s Partnership for Economic Growth (C-PEG).

Funding for the 16 checks, totaling $68,836, was made possible by key contributors, including the Community Investment Collaborative and the Tobacco Region Revitalization Commission, as well as various other local organizations.

“These students completed a business plan and financial projections during the competition for business incentive funding,” said Martinsville-Henry County Chamber of Commerce President Brenell Thomas. “All of them did a phenomenal job with their business pitches.”

“I tell that story to encourage somebody else in the audience who might have applied in the past,” Thomas said. “Sometimes, for whatever reason, it’s just not your time, but these folks were persistent, and they came back again this year.”

Hello, my name is Em. I am a 22-year-old female. I have been roleplaying for a long time.  Like a very long time.  I started on Whisper if that ages me at all. Anyway, I am a novella writer. What that means is I write 500-2k words per post. I regularly break the Discord limit. I write exclusively in third person. I also enjoy writing on Discord, preferably, but I can be open to other methods. This can include spicy scenes, but with that being said. That is not the main focus of this role, and if you are looking for that, I am not the writer for you. I do a ratio of 90 percent story to 10 percent smut for this role. I love chatting about our characters and making friends with my writing partners, so please be okay with that.

**What I am looking for in a partner**

I am looking for someone who wants to write. This is a creative writing hobby. Meaning I want effort from my partners. I would like a reply at least once a day, but I understand that we are human and have lives. I am looking for someone who can match my length and effort. Someone who understands that spicy isn't the main focus. Someone who wants to be friends with their RP partner. I am also looking for someone who is over the age of 20.

So to recap:

-Please be 20 years old or older. 

-Please match my length and effort.

-Please understand that while romance is a requirement, this is not all about smut. 

-I understand life gets busy, but let's try to reply at least once a day… The key word being try! 

- I love sharing stuff that makes me think of our characters and just being friends with my partners.  So please be open to OOC chatting. 


**Role** 

Muse A is my character.Muse B is yours. 


Muse A is homeless and a junkie.  She was a veteran and served in a war.  But the money ran out.  People stoped caring. So muse A was left to fend for herself. One day she scrapes together the last of her change holding up the line at the coffee shop and muse B is pissed that she is holding up the line.  Though he decides he can help her.   

Maybe they are old friends reuniting or something?  I just want a good old sappy romance with a little drama. 


(Password: Baby it’s cold outside)

**Writing Sample:**

Paige sat in the rundown, disgusting gas station bathroom. Five minutes—five minutes of pure hell. She paced the single-stall bathroom, wishing her feet didn't stick to the floor, wishing it didn't smell in here. This wasn't how she had planned it or how she had planned her life. Though everyone always said you can't plan life, Paige had found a way to make it work.

The stickiness of the floor seemed to drag her back to reality, which was somehow worse than planning to run from this problem, but she couldn't run from it. No, this was her life now as she looked at her phone again. 4 minutes and 45 seconds were left.

Paige was spiraling, probably because they were not even speaking at the moment. The fight seemed so stupid now. So small compared to this, but it wasn't that she had caught them together. In her bed, in her apartment. The memories came flooding back, no matter how much Paige tried to block them out. Her best friend had slept with her boyfriend. She supposed it was made better by the fact Adrain and slept with Jeffrey. That was something Paige couldn't give him. It wasn't another woman.

Standing in that bathroom, in the crappy, definitely haunted gas station on Seventh Street, Paige was contemplating her entire life, and the only two people she wanted to talk to were currently not speaking to her.

That was most definitely on account of her reaction, but how else was she supposed to react to walking in on that scene? Was she supposed to throw them a party? Adrain was still cheating, and the part that hurt the worst was Jeffrey's betrayal. Jeffrey was her best friend; they had grown up together. The two were inseparable from the moment Paige moved into the neighborhood at nine years old.

It was the fifth foster home in five months, the fourth couple, and the fifth month without her older brother. Justin was her everything. He raised her, but when Paige got pneumonia from the cold winter nights spent sleeping outside, Justin had to do what he could. ""I'll always love you, and the second I can, I will come get you, I promise,"" the words ran through her head as she closed her eyes for a moment.

That was nearly fifteen years ago. Fifteen years ago, that was the night a terrified nine-year-old girl met the little Jewish boy down the street, and suddenly she had a friend in this world.  
""Justin, I need you to come get me."" Paige whispered softly as she wiped her eyes. Her voice was breaking as she thought about her hero for the first time in a long time.

Justin had died five years ago, but that wound never quite healed. There was always a time in her life when Paige needed her brother. She thought Justin was more like her dad until she met Jim. Jim Goldberg was her adoptive father, and that man would do anything for Paige. Would he do this? I love her through this. Paige shook softly as she stood in the far-too-bright gas station bathroom.

The loud and obnoxious ring of the timer on her phone pulled Paige from her spiral only momentarily. The alarm going off meant she had to look and see if she was pregnant or not. The stick on the counter wrapped up in that neon pink wrap seemed to be taunting her. Maybe it was just food poisoning or the flu. Maybe she was being paranoid. God, she hoped she was being paranoid. Mumbling a prayer under her breath, Paige sighed softly as she reached forward. Her long, thin fingers shook violently as she picked up the stick.

PREGNANT.

In that moment, Paige was positive; it made her heart stop. She at least definitely stopped breathing for a moment or two. That word was taunting her. She was pregnant. Pregnant, unmarried, and very Jewish. The sound that escaped Paige's lips was a gut-wrenching noise as she stood there.

All she wanted in that moment was to call Justin and tell him she had to come get her. He wasn't going to ask why she couldn't drive herself home from a gas station. No, there would be no questions; he would simply give her a ride in silence and worry about her Jeep tomorrow.  
With shaking hands and teary eyes, Paige called the next person she could think of. ""Papa"" Paige cried as she held the phone to her ear.

Suddenly she was nine years old, again terrified of Jim's very presence in his own home. She was back in her childhood bedroom, hiding under the bed. She smiled at the memory of Jim reading bedtime stories in an empty room as Paige hid under the bed. He would end everyone with, ""Papa, loves you; it's okay. You are safe."" She needed that now more than ever.

1oemwpv,https://i.redd.it/h17uomwv6zwf1.png,Help me understand my taste in perfumes!,"Okay, so I'm not new to perfumes, but I'm pretty new to ""thinking"" about liking them. My current collection is pretty basic and small, but I think it's fair to say I really enjoy them all. Now, I just can't figure out what I LIKE about these perfumes that other perfumes might lack for me. How would you guys describe my taste (other than basic lol)?

I went to Sephora and Shoppers Drug Mart today (I'm in Canada) to scout out some perfumes for the Sephora sale.. and I feel like I tested a lot (I tested so many that I only sprayed 2 on my skin to test them...). I was curious about some of the more trendy perfumes that I haven't tried yet or older ones I couldn't remember much about. Off the top of my head the few I really didn't mind were Dior Blooming Bouquet, Chloe Nomade, and J'adore Dior, Tom Ford Neroli Portofino (which was a cute scent but I don't think I'd buy it). I didn't walk away thinking that I just \*needed\* any of these. Nomade was one I tried on my skin and I do kind of like it.

Maybe I went out of control and got a bit nose blind, but I tried and didn't care for: KAYALI: Love Fest Burning Cherry,  Yum Boujee Marshmallow, Yum Pistachio Gelato; YSL: Libre, Black Opium, Mon Paris, Myslf ; Replica: Coffee Break (generally don't care for other Replica scents I've tried in the past)  ; Ariana Grande: Cloud ; Burberry Goddess, Her Intense (I didn't care for Her, either) ; Versace Bright Crystal ; Chloe Nomade Nuit d'Egypte. Tom Ford: Rose Prick, Rose Cafe, Oud Wood. PHLUR: Cherry Stem. NEST: Lychee Rose.

None of them were bad, but nothing really CAUGHT my attention. None of them made me want to smell like THAT. Could my taste be super out of sync with the market right now?

Help me understand what I like! I'm overthinking this aren't I?

1oemvyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1oemvyd/jack/,Jack,"Jack was a lonely person. Not for lack of others, but for the silence within. He never had a friend like the kind he read in books, who understands what you think before you think it; rather, he had friends who did not think his thoughts even though theirs were pretty mundane, and a person must surely, sooner or later, get bored of it and start to think otherwise. All Jack did was humour them, allowing them to experience that their stories were important too. This way Jack made a lot of companions, never a friend though.

However, he had made peace with it, with his thoughts, which opened him to a new direction, albeit a sadder one. Jack had never been the optimistic kind, now, he could find out why that was. Jack was late to his work, again, because he had work before work — answering all his questions — the questions he had thought about for a long time now — but every time he reached the same conclusions. He was pissed and disappointed in his inability to answer his questions, at least not in a way that would make him happier.

He rode out, as usual, to his office. He passed through numerous gates, and climbed a lot of stairs, Jack had not moved from his room, the world moved around him, finally after his view changed from his windows -- outside which he saw high-rise buildings, shops trying to sell dreams and necessities together, and a small protected section trying to retain what was once a park, with a slide in the middle of it which some children kept climbing on, still happy doing the same thing over and over again -- to a cab to the train station, then the train, and a bus, he reached his building without ever slightly thinking about what was happening around, he had a lot more important things to think about. It was a big building, about 40 stories high, or maybe 50; it did not matter to Jack. His room was on the 23rd floor, and that was the only knowledge he needed about his day, undisturbed by the melancholy of information floating all around him.

He reached his office half an hour late, but he had no one to apologise to, and he liked how it felt. Maybe he went late on purpose, to exercise his freedom in front of himself. Jack was lonely, but he was always surrounded by his ghosts, who did not care about him, but only the outcome of his existence. Maybe he unearthed those ghosts himself, by asking questions that shouldn't be asked by humans. He certainly was not the first person to ask these questions, but he was one of the first to question the answers — at least that’s the way he felt, because Jack never had a friend he read about in books. Jack read countless books, hoping to find a line he hadn’t already imagined, but their words lay barren on a dying field, striving for profundity yet failing, unwatered.

He entered his office after passing through the long corridor with beautiful pictures, which some people appraised for depth, but all Jack saw was someone trying to recreate what they experienced in that moment, but failing miserably, because none of the people who saw his paintings had ever thought how the artist did, they merely got a glimpse into a second of his life. He briefly bowed to the receptionist, who looked after all the single-owned businesses on the floor. She was a woman in her mid 20s, a charming young lady, exactly the kind you would want in such a desolate world. His business was therapy. Initially, when he had decided to choose this profession, he felt the irony hit him hard, yet he went with this choice because he had lost interest in everything and everyone. He no longer saw humans as people; he saw them as subjects, in the hope that talking to people who question everything might actually help him get his answers. So far, all he did was listen and observe, gaining nothing new from them. He entered his room on the far left corner and opened the windows to let the stale old air pass out. He stood for a while looking outside his window as he brewed coffee in the machine he’d bought from the store on the 3rd floor. He saw high-rise buildings, people walking the streets, and, at the far end of his vision, a small enclosure with grass and a tree in its center.

People, as he thought, were basic; they were all the same, at every scale. They lived in a three-dimensional world. Their problems just hung to time like a loose leaf, weathering every moment, birthing every other. Jack had found his problem. He, instead, had shifted to a four-dimensional world — a world where he lived all of time, all the time. He saw the impermanence of things, their carcass, right when it bloomed at him. He did not care about anything because he had lived through billions of years, every day.

He had realized that all memories are sad; there does not exist a happy memory. For if a happy memory means that the person is happy after the memory, it's not possible, because all happy memories bring forward the contrast to the present life. The life that was once there, in that moment of time, that fled away swiftly, day after day, year after year, and what remains is a figment of what we were, of what we are. These are the memories which shape us, but all Jack could think was that they shaped him into an unhappy person. He could remember good and bad, but nothing important.

What's interesting, Jack thought to himself, sipping his coffee and pacing the room while his patient got ready for the session by calming his breath and focusing his thoughts — which was quite opposite of how Jack was getting ready for the session — is that we do not get to control what memories we keep. Some of them just imprint on our souls randomly, and make us a random person. Or maybe that was just him. Yes, he was a random person. He looked at the patient from all sides, nothing about him aroused even a pinch of interest in Jack, he sat on his chair, right in front of the patient and took a bleak breath.

“Why should I live?” asked the patient, breaking Jack’s train of thought. He was mildly interested and mostly shocked. He had gotten this question thousands of times, but they were all accompanied by tears and sorrow on the face, a pain in the eyes. But this was different. This person didn’t fear, or cry; he seemed simply curious. Of course, Jack had asked this question multiple times, but today something pierced him, hearing this question from someone else. He got defensive, trying to protect his thoughts, which were supposed to be his alone.

“You shouldn't!” said Jack. The patient seemed confused, and even more engaged. “We, as humans, must, like all other animals, want to survive. But this question just goes against nature's principle. Someone who asks this question has already stopped living. But how long should a person hold on, in the hope of finding something to live for again, is subjective. And since you've come here, your time is already up.”

The patient chuckled. “You are precisely correct, but what kind of a therapist says that to their patient? Do you not care about human life?”

“I don’t, honestly,” Jack said, his voice a quiet confession. “The same way I don’t care about anything else. There’s no point in enjoying things when you see their cadaver. I see you; I don’t know your past, but whatever it was, it was always a probable one. When you live in numbers, feelings fade away. Even your future, whatever it may be, does not matter, because it too is probable. Some people, however, get addicted to this gambling, thinking they’ve got the better hand, when people like us aren’t even playing. I see you, and many yous, many mes, just lingering in the world, trying to make sense of things. The way your eyes search mine, unblinking, tells me you know this too. I am just one of the numbers, and so are you. Your living changes nothing from what was meant to be, for every life is equal to every other; the difference is whether you choose to play.”

His curtains were open, he realized, when he suddenly felt a chill on his neck. The room was silent. The patient took a sip of water and fired back, “If numbers make you sad, why don't you forsake them? If the numbers have bleak probabilities, why not believe in possibilities? Oh wait, people like us don't believe in anything immeasurable, right? We just believe what we can quantify, for everything else, there are stories. Some are more sensible than others, but useless, nonetheless. Why don't you stop calculating, and just experience life as it is? Ah, yes, because life is pain, and anything painful must be avoided, right?”

Jack seemed startled, he was not expecting such a dialogue today; it had been a slow, similar day. At least he had someone to prove wrong today. “I don't think all things painful must be avoided, because a person grows in this pain, becomes more capable of observing the numbers, because yes, numbers are the only things that do not depend on who's seeing them, how they became the person they are. Numbers are absolute for everyone; they don’t see humans as different. Everyone is the same to the numbers. We are merely at the mercy of the numbers, and I choose to rebel against them. But, I don't think one stands a chance against numbers, what do you think?”

The patient stood up, walked to the window, slightly blocking the cold air Jack longed for now, left a gentle smile, and said, “I think we should celebrate losing to the numbers. If we are just a digit, we have nothing to fear, because numbers are absolute. Whatever happens to you is always probable. You don’t see your effects on things now, because you have figured out that everything smoothes out with time. But who are we, and what are we doing here? We do not have any sense of time apart from ours. Time does not pass linearly for people; time passes with events. What we remember makes us, as you said, but what we remember depends on the numbers. The more we do, the more we remember, and the more we change — whether for good or bad — it’s just a game of numbers. Stop expecting yourself to be more than a number. You must believe in your theory, if not anyone else’s. Once you do that, and submit to numbers, you will be free from the torment of rebelling against them,” the patient moved around Jack and leaned on the chair in front of him, “You’ve stayed here a long time, thinking about things instead of gathering more data. If you give up on becoming more—because no such thing exists—you become free from people like me. Because yeah, I don’t think anyone stands a chance against the numbers.”

Jack’s eyes lingered on the patient. There was something familiar in the tone, in the words… something he had said before or thought, maybe earlier that very day. A chill crept along his neck, and the silence of the room seemed to thicken, almost pressing in from all sides. He fell silent, trying to find thoughts to grasp, but his mind was empty. He couldn’t tell what scared him more: the thoughts or their absence.

There was a knock on the door, and he turned to see through the little glass part of the door. It was the secretary outside; she looked at him, and waved cheerfully, easing the tension inside his mind. A relief washed over him. The patient waved his hand signaling Jack to attend to her. He walked to the door and opened it, greeted with a huge smile, he never understood why she smiled at him, maybe she did that with everyone, or maybe he had been successful in hiding himself from her for years now. “Your 10:30 is here, should I send her in?” His eyebrows squeezed; he looked at his watch, it was 10:25, he quickly turned back to find the room empty, an eerie silence washing over him. He felt as if someone had left the place, but he had arrived somehow. This had never happened before; maybe he’d dozed off and it was a dream, but he swore he could remember the smell of muffins coming from the open window, a splash of rain in his hair. “Yes, yes, please do,” he said, “and thank you.” She gave him a cheerful smile and went away. He stood next to the window, held his thoughts, gave them a later appointment, and proceeded with his day.

That day was like every other day, just a less probable one, maybe. After work, he mingled into the crowd, full of people, full of numbers. Maybe he hadn't experienced his share of improbable events; maybe this was one of them. He went to his favourite coffee shop, which wasn't even his choice now, just a habit, and asked for a cold matcha instead of the hot latte that he ordered every day. He sat on a park bench, a bench really, there wasn’t enough park to call it a park, he looked up, trying to see the sky, but all he saw was himself, all around him, in different buildings, 40 or 50 stories high. He sipped his matcha and left a gentle smile. He had finally found a friend, a shadow, within himself. Jack was not lonely anymore.",1,1761274985.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Behind.

A beloved love letter I cherish, now I'm eighty-eight.

To be found in my will when I'm finally back underground. 

For you, my children and grandchildren, to see.

For soon, I'll be with my wife and your mother.

My beloved Sarah Lee.

A little letter so you all can always remember that I've climbed into all sorts of dirty pits.

Starting many years ago.

When Ma gave me my first snap box, and sent me to work, in late December.

When at fourteen, I got one of my many work permits.

And since that first day, I've scrubbed for hours.

To clean my decent, hard-working soul.

To be healthy for my family, before I went home.

After spending all day and night
Just digging deep, for black coal.

I was born just before Gas was crowned as King, and all generations went into the pit.

Like all baptized to do so, before us, if they were all forced to admit it.

Men and boys who we soon knew, forever, would be our kin.

Going into the light or darkness, to earn a few bob.

Following all our own fathers and grandfathers footsteps.

When our time too came, when they asked casually over breakfast.

Are you, ready, son?

And we all replied over hot coffee with a silent nod.

Remember me.
My name was, Tommy O'Malley.

From God's Country. 
 
Where we chased the mad black stuff like it was our lives' bounty.

Those courageous, strong men
Who, like me.

When we heard the call, willingly sacrificed our brief lives.

Chasing fools, black gold.

So our families, and you all, could eat and be insulated from all weathers.

But, particularly, from the winter's bleak cold.

Remember me, is all I ask, as I'm reunited with my Sarah Lee.

Your mother and grandmother. 

For true love always reunites, to be together, forever in all weathers.

In a place where you'll never grow old, as your stories and memories, are once more retold. 

Always remember us.

Don't let our memories, with you all, turn to dust.

1oemrmo,https://elevatuscoach.com/how-do-we-c2r2e-daily/,The Question That Changed How I Explain C2R2E,"A few days ago, someone on LinkedIn asked me a question that’s been sitting with me ever since:

*""How can we use C2R2E daily?""*

That question hit me—because C2R2E isn’t something most people have heard of. It’s not a buzzword, a trend, or a theory you’d find in a book. It’s something I built from lived experience—born out of structure, necessity, and clarity during some of the hardest years of my life.

For context, **C2R2E** stands for:  
**Collapse → Confrontation → Realignment → Reclamation → Elevation.**

It’s a framework I developed after going through multiple life resets—divorce, co-parenting battles, financial instability, and starting over while serving full-time in the military. Through each chapter, I began to see a pattern. Every major breakthrough I had followed the same rhythm: things would fall apart, I’d face the truth, I’d adjust my direction, I’d take back control piece by piece, and eventually, I’d rise again.

That rhythm became the foundation of what I now call **The C2R2E Framework**—a structured way to move through life’s disruptions without losing yourself in the process.

It’s not meant to motivate you—it’s meant to stabilize you.  
Because life isn’t random; it’s rhythmic.

We collapse. We confront. We realign. We reclaim. We elevate.  
That’s the cycle of growth.

C2R2E gives you language and structure for that process. It helps you turn chaos into clarity and motion into meaning. It’s how I learned to rebuild, not once, but again and again.

Even now, I still live it daily.  
Some mornings I collapse before coffee. Some days, I realign halfway through a meeting. But every day, I reclaim something—peace, focus, or perspective. And at night, I reflect. C2R2E reminds me that progress isn’t measured by how fast we move—it’s measured by the peace we build along the way.

So if you are wondering how to apply C2R2E in your own life—whether you’re rebuilding after a loss, redefining how you parent, or embracing a new season—this post might help you see how structure creates calm.

And because this community is built on honest conversation—  
When life feels uncertain, what helps *you* realign and rebuild?",1,1761274623.0,ElevatusCoaching,0,1.0,False

I’m looking to get my first espresso setup (machine only for now, I ""modded"" my Timemore C3s with a washer and that’ll do the job until I can grab an ESP). The tricky part is that I’m in South America, so my options are limited, all the machines available here are chinese knock-offs (not opposed to one if they’re actually reliable, though that feels like an oxymoron lol), and I can’t easily find common beginner models like the Breville/Sage Bambino since they don’t show up on Amazon Europe (which is one of the few reliable ways I can import gear).

I like my coffee black, mostly espresso (or doppio). I drink about one-two cups a day. My budget is around $500–700 USD, though importing usually adds a lot of cost sadly.

Given these limitations, what would you recommend for a beginner setup that’s still decent quality and compatible with 220v? Any brands or specific models that tend to be easier to find in this voltage range or that ship internationally would be a big help.

Thanks in advance for any tips, it’s been tough finding realistic options from here.

I'm Mike, its nice to meet you! I'm a 34M down in Texas, a recent-ish transplant from the west coast, and let me tell you I'm so happy I moved.

To the point - I'm looking for my wife to have a family with. I've matured over the last couple years and can safely say that I'm ready. I have a job, I have hobbies, I have traveled, and now I'm at the gates of the next chapter.

So, why here? I'm kind of sick of the dating game out in the wild. I'd like to cut to the chase and date in a pool of women that know what they want, and start things off with the immediate understanding of what we want.

And what do we want? Traditional roles. I want to be your husband, and provide for you. Create a house for you so that you can create a household, and in return create a household for us and the family we'll create together.

A little about myself: I'm 5'11, white, 180lbs and active. Ive been playing a lot of tennis, love to hike and camp, and I go to the gym. I have all sorts of interests, from riding, traveling / exploring, archery, sailing, games, movies, shows, writing. Yes, I have a brain and I'm not afraid to use it. I enjoy a good conversation, and enjoy talking to people - strangers or not. I love a good cup of coffee, a walk along the water, and jazz... and techno and classical. There's a lot.

As for what I'm looking for, I'm looking for a strong woman, who is intelligent and knows what she wants, and is willing to build something together. I will carry you, as long as I can lean on you when I need you. 2 things are dealbreakers: I do not want a princess, I want a queen. Immaturity is not possible if this is to work. Second, be fit. I'm not attracted to obesity, sorry.

Please feel free to send me a message! I'd love to talk. And please be in the US - I dont think it will work with a tremendous distance between us.

Hope to hear from ya,

I wasn't super popular when I was a kid but I made a few friends along the way, all of whom I still talk to and have largely uncomplicated relationship with. However, there is this thing where a lot of these relationships were born out of convenience and I don't have a lot in common with them except for the people we know and we talk about life. I only ever had one friend that I had so much in common with we never ran out of things to talk about and literally spent nights just talking, laughing, crying. Same interests, similar opinions. I never felt that close to any friend in a sense until I wasn't.

We were acquitances, then we became friendly, that's when she started looking for a roommate and we ended up living together for five years and we became very close, at one point just spending most of our free time together. We never truly had a fight, we had couple of healthy exchanges but nothing escalated or damaging.

And as we got really close we suddenly completely fell apart. I was struggling with depression at the time as things fell apart for me on multiple fronts at the same time and I don't know. I suppose I was a hot mess although I still don't see any unforgivable mistake in my behavior towards her in particular looking back at it even now years later (and I don't think I am a person who's incapable of self-reflection). 

She suddenly, and I mean literally from day to day without anything significant happening between us (that I know of), stopped initiating conversations with me and when I tried talking to her, it felt like she was forcing herself to respond and then made up an excuse to stop talking to me after a short while. It felt uncomfortable so I stopped talking to her too and we just lived in the same tiny apartment in complete silence for a couple of weeks/months and sometimes she would even turn hostile about stupid things that never bothered her before or bothered her slightly. Those were the only times she would speak to me then. It made me feel terrible especially given I was already mentally unwell due to some other stuff that was happening simultaneously and completely independently but this just broke my heart and I was crying myself to sleep which she must have known.

I moved out after a relatively short period of time after this started happenning partly because of that, partly because I found a new job elsewhere by a coincidence. When I arrived at her parents' place to return her the keys months later, she was almost normal. Slightly apologetic in demeanor though she didn't really say sorry but we had something akin to a heart to heart. She said, vaguely, she was unsatisfied with herself and that she was feeling depressed and that she's seeking help and some slightly odd things that happened to her recently. I told her the same, we promised to see each other for a coffee some time, we were quite fine though nothing was really explained and then we never saw each other again.

Even now, years later I cannot explain what happenned and the sudden complete change in her behavior. She reached out to me a couple of times on social media over the years about how I am and vageuly asked me if I want to meet up but then she would stop responding and I didn't know how to restart the conversation. I feel some sort of a guilt as I feel like I must have done something to her but simultaneously, I am too afraid to ask out of sudden because I feel like even though it's cowardly it would be hard for me to hear what made me such a terrible friend and I don't even know if she remembers at this point. I also feel somewhat betrayed because I was really at one of my lowest points and she made it so much worse. I miss her in my life, I miss the best friend I ever had before all that happened and at the same time I feel like the time for when we could have truly rekindled has passed. There is a part of me that feels ashamed because I feel like she was more important to me than I was to her and it's still hard to swallow sometimes. 

It's just an unfinished chapter, I guess and it makes me sad.

Men and boys who we soon knew, forever, would be our kin.

Going into the light or darkness, to earn a few bob.

Following all our own fathers and grandfathers footsteps.

When our time too came, when they asked casually over breakfast.

Are you, ready, son?

And we all replied over hot coffee with a silent nod.

Remember me.
My name was, Tommy O'Malley.

From God's Country. 
 
Where we chased the mad black stuff like it was our lives' bounty.

Those courageous, strong men
Who, like me.

When we heard the call, willingly sacrificed our brief lives.

Chasing fools, black gold.

So our families, and you all, could eat and be insulated from all weathers.

But, particularly, from the winter's bleak cold.

Remember me, is all I ask, as I'm reunited with my Sarah Lee.

Your mother and grandmother. 

For true love always reunites, to be together, forever in all weathers.

In a place where you'll never grow old, as your stories and memories, are once more retold. 

Always remember us.

Don't let our memories, with you all, turn to dust.

BF started at 17% via navy tape method. 

I did another measurement ytd. It is a little strange because tape method says 14% (This sounds too good to be true) while body composition machine at the gym (electrical impedance machine with handles) hovers from 14-18%. I am going to stay on the safe side and assume I am around 16% for now because it is just 12 days.

My macro is currently 131 protein, 20 carbs, 107 fat on rest day. I always go slightly over for protein and under for fat (+- 5g). 

What is MORE important, however, is how I currently feel after I follow the protocol closely. 

Before I was eating chickens and a lot of protein shake and didnt think much. After, I am now eating chicken, fish, beef, eggs, almonds, broccoli and spinach depending on what I feel like eating, while keeping track of my macros. I feel ridiculously energetic, and I notice more definition of my muscles too (not a lot yet IMO, but I am certainly at the best state in my life so far according to my partner). 

Magnesium supplement helps me a lot. Additionally, drinking coffee then followed with potassium and sodium electrolytes feels better than smoking, which is hilariously insane because I was a vape addict. Ketogains protocol has been amazing so far.

This post is a feature request for a way to unlock my truck without a key fob or taking my phone out of my pocket. My idea is to re-use one of the buttons (I think driver’s side gear tunnel would be perfect) 


Alright, mini-rant. I’ve had my R1T for about 2.5 years and it’s still one of my favorite things I’ve ever owned. But holy hell, the proximity locking makes me insane.

I use my iPhone as the key. It works great… maybe too great. Every single time I walk by the truck: unlocked. Walk away: locked.
Grocery store?
– Walk up with the bags → unlocked.
– Go put the cart away → locked.
– Come back → unlocked again.

It’s like my truck’s playing peekaboo with me all day long. I’ve got “Home” set up as an exception, but anywhere else (the office, a coffee shop, whatever), I can literally hear it click-clack locking and unlocking outside like it’s having a Bluetooth identity crisis.

At the grocery store, if I know I’m gonna be right back, I’ll literally leave one of the doors cracked open just to stop the thing from locking and starting the cycle again. It’s ridiculous.

And don’t even get me started on the door handles . they’re constantly extending and retracting from all this unnecessary locking/unlocking. It’s needless wear and tear on a $90K truck.

I actually got rid of my old Model S for a number of reasons, but this constant lock/unlock behavior was definitely one of them. The irony is, if I end up getting rid of the Rivian, it’ll probably be for a Tesla Model Y… because the door handles don’t move. They’re simple, fixed, and not destined to fail from overuse.

All I want is a simple manual option that still requires the phone-as-key to be in range (in my pocket), so there’s no security issue. Something like:
	•	Press the gear tunnel button once → unlock
	•	Press it twice → open the tunnel
	•	Press it three times → lock everything

Boom. Problem solved. No app, no fob, no Bluetooth drama.

Love the truck. Hate these f***ing locks.

Up until a couple days ago, I had been able to use the coffee creations mode to make iced lattes and on Monday morning it crapped out on me. It still works in general, but I’m really curious as to why this feature stopped working for me! When I press twice, it just shows up as a white light like it would be doing outside coffee creations mode (see video). The app says my machine is up to date and good to go, but when I try rinsing or doing some sort of command from the app, it’s now no longer able to connect to my machine (yes it’s a stupid complaint and first world problem, I’m well aware). I have contacted customer service and they seemed confused by the situation too. My machine also cannot connect to wifi anymore.

Has anyone else experienced this? Am I just SOL and need to get a new machine? For reference, I bought it off FB Marketplace for $30, so it’s not a total loss, but I will miss it dearly if its time is up.

I miss you. I always have. The way your name is in my head as often as my heart beats. The silence between us has always been loud, but now it’s deafening, maybe it’s because we have hit double digits since we last spoke. I have run from one distraction to another all these years. I tried hobbies. I traveled, and learned I actually do like planes.
I tried camping. I learned languages. I got a degree. 
But through it all, I missed you terribly. I missed you while staring at the ocean in Europe. I missed you when I built a campfire the way you showed me. I know 3 languages I can miss you in now. I missed you when I drank coffee at night to get through exams. I miss you every November when I watch the stars. 
I miss you when I see the empty spaces between my fingers where yours fit perfectly. 
I missed you when my dog died. I wanted to tell you, but it didn’t feel right to reach out with bad news. I have typed so many messages out over the years, only to delete them all. After all, I ended it. I told you to move on. I tried to do the same, I really did. No one ever came close to you. 
No matter what, I missed you. So much has changed, yet somehow, everything is still the same.

# Hidden Gem: Esuki Esquites

Just discovered this Japanese-Mexican fusion spot off Hamilton Pool Road and it's legit. Esuki Esquites takes classic esquites bowls and flips them with rice or yakisoba noodles, proteins like pork belly or tofu al pastor, and toppings like Tajin, woodear mushrooms, and bonito flakes.

The menu is simple but flexible and everything feels intentional. The miso mushroom quesadilla and pork belly bao are standouts. The team behind the window is incredibly friendly - they even handed out a strawberries and cream dessert on the house.

This isn't a gimmick - it's just really good food served by people who clearly care. Worth checking out if you're in the area.

# Restaurant News Updates

**REOPENING:** A One Dumplings & Noodle Bar is scheduled to reopen November 15 after suspected arson. Good to see them bouncing back.

**CLOSING:** La Cabana is closing at the end of November to make room for a new high school. Relocation TBD. If you've been meaning to go, now's the time.

I didn’t notice the strict direction on parchment paper cutting until after the cake was in the oven. I was on automatic pilot and crinkled it, but the cake surprisingly turned out ok but very thin. I was happy with the cake, coffee syrup, and chocolate ganache, but the buttercream was a mess. This would probably be taller if my buttercream had turned out fluffier.

1oemard,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1oemard/ms_jack/,[MS] Jack,"Jack was a lonely person. Not for lack of others, but for the silence within. He never had a friend like the kind he read in books, who understands what you think before you think it; rather, he had friends who did not think his thoughts even though theirs were pretty mundane, and a person must surely, sooner or later, get bored of it and start to think otherwise. All Jack did was humour them, allowing them to experience that their stories were important too. This way Jack made a lot of companions, never a friend though.

However, he had made peace with it, with his thoughts, which opened him to a new direction, albeit a sadder one. Jack had never been the optimistic kind, now, he could find out why that was. Jack was late to his work, again, because he had work before work — answering all his questions — the questions he had thought about for a long time now — but every time he reached the same conclusions. He was pissed and disappointed in his inability to answer his questions, at least not in a way that would make him happier.

He rode out, as usual, to his office. He passed through numerous gates, and climbed a lot of stairs, Jack had not moved from his room, the world moved around him, finally after his view changed from his windows -- outside which he saw high-rise buildings, shops trying to sell dreams and necessities together, and a small protected section trying to retain what was once a park, with a slide in the middle of it which some children kept climbing on, still happy doing the same thing over and over again -- to a cab to the train station, then the train, and a bus, he reached his building without ever slightly thinking about what was happening around, he had a lot more important things to think about. It was a big building, about 40 stories high, or maybe 50; it did not matter to Jack. His room was on the 23rd floor, and that was the only knowledge he needed about his day, undisturbed by the melancholy of information floating all around him.

He reached his office half an hour late, but he had no one to apologise to, and he liked how it felt. Maybe he went late on purpose, to exercise his freedom in front of himself. Jack was lonely, but he was always surrounded by his ghosts, who did not care about him, but only the outcome of his existence. Maybe he unearthed those ghosts himself, by asking questions that shouldn't be asked by humans. He certainly was not the first person to ask these questions, but he was one of the first to question the answers — at least that’s the way he felt, because Jack never had a friend he read about in books. Jack read countless books, hoping to find a line he hadn’t already imagined, but their words lay barren on a dying field, striving for profundity yet failing, unwatered.

He entered his office after passing through the long corridor with beautiful pictures, which some people appraised for depth, but all Jack saw was someone trying to recreate what they experienced in that moment, but failing miserably, because none of the people who saw his paintings had ever thought how the artist did, they merely got a glimpse into a second of his life. He briefly bowed to the receptionist, who looked after all the single-owned businesses on the floor. She was a woman in her mid 20s, a charming young lady, exactly the kind you would want in such a desolate world. His business was therapy. Initially, when he had decided to choose this profession, he felt the irony hit him hard, yet he went with this choice because he had lost interest in everything and everyone. He no longer saw humans as people; he saw them as subjects, in the hope that talking to people who question everything might actually help him get his answers. So far, all he did was listen and observe, gaining nothing new from them. He entered his room on the far left corner and opened the windows to let the stale old air pass out. He stood for a while looking outside his window as he brewed coffee in the machine he’d bought from the store on the 3rd floor. He saw high-rise buildings, people walking the streets, and, at the far end of his vision, a small enclosure with grass and a tree in its center.

People, as he thought, were basic; they were all the same, at every scale. They lived in a three-dimensional world. Their problems just hung to time like a loose leaf, weathering every moment, birthing every other. Jack had found his problem. He, instead, had shifted to a four-dimensional world — a world where he lived all of time, all the time. He saw the impermanence of things, their carcass, right when it bloomed at him. He did not care about anything because he had lived through billions of years, every day.

He had realized that all memories are sad; there does not exist a happy memory. For if a happy memory means that the person is happy after the memory, it's not possible, because all happy memories bring forward the contrast to the present life. The life that was once there, in that moment of time, that fled away swiftly, day after day, year after year, and what remains is a figment of what we were, of what we are. These are the memories which shape us, but all Jack could think was that they shaped him into an unhappy person. He could remember good and bad, but nothing important.

What's interesting, Jack thought to himself, sipping his coffee and pacing the room while his patient got ready for the session by calming his breath and focusing his thoughts — which was quite opposite of how Jack was getting ready for the session — is that we do not get to control what memories we keep. Some of them just imprint on our souls randomly, and make us a random person. Or maybe that was just him. Yes, he was a random person. He looked at the patient from all sides, nothing about him aroused even a pinch of interest in Jack, he sat on his chair, right in front of the patient and took a bleak breath.

“Why should I live?” asked the patient, breaking Jack’s train of thought. He was mildly interested and mostly shocked. He had gotten this question thousands of times, but they were all accompanied by tears and sorrow on the face, a pain in the eyes. But this was different. This person didn’t fear, or cry; he seemed simply curious. Of course, Jack had asked this question multiple times, but today something pierced him, hearing this question from someone else. He got defensive, trying to protect his thoughts, which were supposed to be his alone.

“You shouldn't!” said Jack. The patient seemed confused, and even more engaged. “We, as humans, must, like all other animals, want to survive. But this question just goes against nature's principle. Someone who asks this question has already stopped living. But how long should a person hold on, in the hope of finding something to live for again, is subjective. And since you've come here, your time is already up.”

The patient chuckled. “You are precisely correct, but what kind of a therapist says that to their patient? Do you not care about human life?”

“I don’t, honestly,” Jack said, his voice a quiet confession. “The same way I don’t care about anything else. There’s no point in enjoying things when you see their cadaver. I see you; I don’t know your past, but whatever it was, it was always a probable one. When you live in numbers, feelings fade away. Even your future, whatever it may be, does not matter, because it too is probable. Some people, however, get addicted to this gambling, thinking they’ve got the better hand, when people like us aren’t even playing. I see you, and many yous, many mes, just lingering in the world, trying to make sense of things. The way your eyes search mine, unblinking, tells me you know this too. I am just one of the numbers, and so are you. Your living changes nothing from what was meant to be, for every life is equal to every other; the difference is whether you choose to play.”

His curtains were open, he realized, when he suddenly felt a chill on his neck. The room was silent. The patient took a sip of water and fired back, “If numbers make you sad, why don't you forsake them? If the numbers have bleak probabilities, why not believe in possibilities? Oh wait, people like us don't believe in anything immeasurable, right? We just believe what we can quantify, for everything else, there are stories. Some are more sensible than others, but useless, nonetheless. Why don't you stop calculating, and just experience life as it is? Ah, yes, because life is pain, and anything painful must be avoided, right?”

Jack seemed startled, he was not expecting such a dialogue today; it had been a slow, similar day. At least he had someone to prove wrong today. “I don't think all things painful must be avoided, because a person grows in this pain, becomes more capable of observing the numbers, because yes, numbers are the only things that do not depend on who's seeing them, how they became the person they are. Numbers are absolute for everyone; they don’t see humans as different. Everyone is the same to the numbers. We are merely at the mercy of the numbers, and I choose to rebel against them. But, I don't think one stands a chance against numbers, what do you think?”

The patient stood up, walked to the window, slightly blocking the cold air Jack longed for now, left a gentle smile, and said, “I think we should celebrate losing to the numbers. If we are just a digit, we have nothing to fear, because numbers are absolute. Whatever happens to you is always probable. You don’t see your effects on things now, because you have figured out that everything smoothes out with time. But who are we, and what are we doing here? We do not have any sense of time apart from ours. Time does not pass linearly for people; time passes with events. What we remember makes us, as you said, but what we remember depends on the numbers. The more we do, the more we remember, and the more we change — whether for good or bad — it’s just a game of numbers. Stop expecting yourself to be more than a number. You must believe in your theory, if not anyone else’s. Once you do that, and submit to numbers, you will be free from the torment of rebelling against them,” the patient moved around Jack and leaned on the chair in front of him, “You’ve stayed here a long time, thinking about things instead of gathering more data. If you give up on becoming more—because no such thing exists—you become free from people like me. Because yeah, I don’t think anyone stands a chance against the numbers.”

Jack’s eyes lingered on the patient. There was something familiar in the tone, in the words… something he had said before or thought, maybe earlier that very day. A chill crept along his neck, and the silence of the room seemed to thicken, almost pressing in from all sides. He fell silent, trying to find thoughts to grasp, but his mind was empty. He couldn’t tell what scared him more: the thoughts or their absence.

There was a knock on the door, and he turned to see through the little glass part of the door. It was the secretary outside; she looked at him, and waved cheerfully, easing the tension inside his mind. A relief washed over him. The patient waved his hand signaling Jack to attend to her. He walked to the door and opened it, greeted with a huge smile, he never understood why she smiled at him, maybe she did that with everyone, or maybe he had been successful in hiding himself from her for years now. “Your 10:30 is here, should I send her in?” His eyebrows squeezed; he looked at his watch, it was 10:25, he quickly turned back to find the room empty, an eerie silence washing over him. He felt as if someone had left the place, but he had arrived somehow. This had never happened before; maybe he’d dozed off and it was a dream, but he swore he could remember the smell of muffins coming from the open window, a splash of rain in his hair. “Yes, yes, please do,” he said, “and thank you.” She gave him a cheerful smile and went away. He stood next to the window, held his thoughts, gave them a later appointment, and proceeded with his day.

That day was like every other day, just a less probable one, maybe. After work, he mingled into the crowd, full of people, full of numbers. Maybe he hadn't experienced his share of improbable events; maybe this was one of them. He went to his favourite coffee shop, which wasn't even his choice now, just a habit, and asked for a cold matcha instead of the hot latte that he ordered every day.

1oelywl,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1oelywl/how_budgeting_with_segregated_accounts_worked/,How budgeting with segregated accounts worked best for me,"Like most folks, I hated the idea of tracking each individual expense. So here’s how I approached budgeting:

1. First I reviewed only my Checking account’s electronic bank statements to see where I spent money in the last 6 months
2. I realized that I wasted a lot of money paying off debts and paying for unnecessary services, so I focused on cutting off these ‘bad’ recurring expenses
3. In 2024 & 2025: I focused on paying off debts and investing the surplus. I used my petty cash, emergency savings and sold off investments to pay off all debts
4. Instead of keeping all my money in one account, I segregated my funds by opening up additional bank accounts. This ensures I no longer commingled my money
5. Then I introduced zero-based budgeting: on pay day, any surplus in my checking account is swept out to my savings account

Here’re some of my segregated accounts (multiple banks)

1. **Allocate sufficient funds to the household operating account**: direct deposit on pay day into a checking account. Used to pay bills and living expenses
2. **Using DCA, auto-route funds to investments**: taxable brokerages which I personally manage
3. **Sinking funds account: my savings account.** When I’m short in my checking account, I transfer funds from here to checking to cover living expenses shortfalls
4. **Emergency funds account: long term savings**. I declined online banking and opted out of mailed monthly statements. When I need to know the balance, I drive up to the bank in person. In the past I’d withdraw constantly. The inconvenience of having to drive to the bank prevented me from draining the account
5. **Petty cash in my pocket:** I get cash to replenish my wallet every payday. I discovered it feels wonderful having cash in my wallet!
6. **Travel funds account:** a new checking account from where I’d obtain funds to cover food, hotel and excursions when I travel. This ensures my primary checking account (Operating Account) isn’t overdrawn when I’m out on vacation. Funded by scheduled bank transfers from my Operating checking account after pay day
7. **Property taxes accounts**: I paid off my mortgage this year. This account helped me pay off my property taxes for the whole of 2025, thus, my operating checking account doesn’t get overdrawn. Funded after pay day from my Sinking Funds. I’ve allocated enough to accumulate and pay off the next property taxes due
8. **Surplus sweep**: on pay day, I sweep the surplus from my operating account using zero based budgeting to my Sinking Funds savings account & sometimes, to my investments

I was sick & tired of living paycheck to paycheck.

With all my debts paid off this year ($0 mortgage, $0 student loans and $0 credit card debts), I’m now left with with car payments, which I plan to be free of in 2026 (keeping fingers crossed)

Using segregated accounts only worked after I cut my living expenses.

Now I don’t need to worry about day to day expenses. In this sense, budgeting made sense to me. I don’t fret over buying expensive coffee at Starbucks but I prefer making my own coffee at home. That said, I have a travel kit, so I can carry my own coffee supplies when I travel.

Reactions? I’m sharing in case someone may wish to learn from my approach.
