1qvnfvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightlossJourney/comments/1qvnfvd/unpopular_opinion_most_people_drink_green_tea_in/,Unpopular opinion: most people drink green tea in a way that makes it useless,"I used to think green tea was just hot green water with marketing.
Everyone around me drinks it like a magic fat-burner and then complains “green tea doesn’t work”.
So I tested green tea properly for a few weeks — and what I realized is uncomfortable.
Here’s the harsh truth:
Green tea isn’t useless.
Most people just consume it completely wrong.
Common mistakes I see everywhere:
Pouring boiling water on the leaves (kills the good compounds)
Drinking it with meals and expecting fat loss
Adding sugar/honey and calling it “healthy”
Drinking 4–5 cups and then blaming caffeine anxiety on “stress”
What actually changed when I fixed it:
Better mental focus (not jittery like coffee)
Less cravings in the afternoon
Digestion felt lighter
Mild fat loss effect (very mild — not magic)
No gym. No calorie counting. Same routine.
The part people won’t like:
If you’re eating junk all day and drinking green tea for damage control — it’s not science, it’s self-deception.
Green tea is a support, not a shortcut.
So now I’m curious:
Is green tea just placebo with caffeine?
Or are expectations totally unrealistic?

1qvnfj6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qvnfj6,O que acontece quando um microbiologista planta café? Mágica 🧙 🪄 (Receita com Hario Switch),"**Sobre o produtor**

Além de fã de Harry Potter, o produtor Derio Garcia é um ex-microbiologista, considerado um dos produtores de café mais inovadores da Colômbia.

Sua técnica envolve a criação de culturas de fermentação próprias e exclusivas, utilizando diferentes leveduras e frutas.

**Sobre a variedade e processamento desse café**

Esse café da rara variedade Ombligon (nome derivado da palavra “umbigo”, devido ao formato de sua cereja), passa por esse processo:

\- Cerejas passadas do ponto são removidas por flutuação.

\- Em seguida, é feito o processo de oxidação de 36 horas. 

\- As cerejas são despolpadas e colocadas em recipientes selados, com um substrato de melancia (feito a partir de polpa de melancia fermentada por 3 dias com leveduras) e a levedura Saccharomyces cerevisiae (utilizada em diversas indústrias, como a vinícola e a de panificação).

\- As cerejas fermentam nessa solução por 48 horas, ou até atingirem um pH médio de 3,5. 

\- Após a fermentação, as cerejas são lavadas e secas por doze dias.

**Minha receita** 

Minha primeira receita foi feita com a Switch, que comecei a experimentar essa semana! Por ser um café processado, pensei que imersão seria uma boa escolha.

Usei a receita do vencedor do World Brewers Cup de 2024, o austríaco Martin Wolfl, que peguei em um site recomendado por um chapa aqui do sub (o link do site é banido aqui no Reddit por algum motivo, mas lá vc encontra várias receitas para Switch - vc encontra a página no perfil do criador do site: https://www.reddit.com/user/syahadatadhiprabowo/).

A receita inclui bloom com a válvula aberta, seguido de um pequeno despejo e rápida imersão (válvula fechada), finalizando com um último despejo com a válvula aberta. Coloquei o print da receita aqui nas imagens do post. Usei água a 88c esperando funk, mas talvez nem precisasse.

**O que achei desse café**

Sinceramente, eu adorei! 

O resultado foi um café de baixo-médio corpo, dulçor baixo, acidez presente, e muitos aromas e sabores de melancia e melão. Os sabores são óbvios, inconfundíveis e meio artificiais - lembrando muito aqueles chicletes de melão de lojas japonesas, e aquele picolé japonês de melão Melona (eu adoro esses chicletes e o picolé kkkk). Sinceramente, cheira mais melão do que a própria fruta! E no bom sentido! Hahaha

Além dos aromas de melão e melancia, em segundo plano existe um frescor herbal que a torrefação diz lembrar pepino e menta. E eu concordo, lembra muito aquelas águas infusionadas com pepino (acho que é pouco comum aqui no Brasil, mas já fiz e tomei muitas vezes e fica muito bom, especialmente com limão). Inclusive, lembrei de tomar uma soda italiana uns bons anos atrás, que era feita com xarope de pepino e xarope de melancia… esse café vai no mesmíssimo sentido!

Pode soar estranho, pois é estranho mesmo hahaha. Mas no bom sentido! 

**Comentários finais**

Eu gostei desse café e nada foi desagradável, mas já estou pensando em melhorias pra próxima receita. Quero extrair mais corpo, incrementar dulçor e diminuir a acidez. Para isso, vou manter a receita e método, ajustando a água para maior dulçor e menor acidez (mais alcalinidade; menos cálcio e mais magnésio), e acho que vou subir a temperatura pra 90c.

E aproveitando para falar um pouco mais de cofermentados… Sou purista, não adoro fermentados etc., mas é impossível não gostar desses cafés co-fermentados, quando são bem feitos. 

Quebrei meu preconceito com esse tipo de processamento primeiro com os cafés do Reizão da King (Goiânia), especialmente o Cocadinha e o Danoninho (deliciosos!). Muitos cafés da King são cofermentados e são sensacionais, trazendo mais vida, aroma e sabor para a xícara… é uma forma de complementar o sensorial que muitas vezes falta nos cafés brasileiros.

Minha segunda experiência foi no passado, quando provei um colombiano da Black&White, cofermentado com pêssego e maracujá. Tem review dele aqui no sub, e se não me engano foi o primeiro ou segundo post feito aqui no sub! Também achei delicioso e, por acaso, quem me deu uma desse desse colombiano foi o Reizão! Vou retribuir presente e deixar uma dose desse café pra ele no fds!

Enfim, perdi o preconceito mesmo com os cofermentados. São cafés que até pessoas com paladar infantil devem gostar 🤣

E por aí, o que você acha desses métodos? Já provou? Tem algum preferido?",1,1770208632.0,CafeEspecialBR,0,1.0,False

I went to the tarot session because I felt stuck with my life. Nothing dramatic, just a steady discomfort I couldn’t shake. The room behind the shop was small, and the woman barely looked at me before laying out the cards. She didn’t try to build suspense or act mystical. She spoke like she was telling me about the weather. She said someone new was coming.

Someone who would change everything. She said I had to be ready, like it wasn’t optional. I left without knowing how to take it. For the rest of the week, her words stayed in my head even though I didn’t believe in that stuff. After a few days the feeling became annoying. I tried to go on with my routine, but every time I entered a café, walked down the street, or checked my phone, I felt like I was supposed to be waiting for something.

A sense of pressure built up, not urgent, just steady and irritating. On the seventh day, I decided to forget about it and went for coffee. I sat down, trying to relax for once. That was when a man approached my table. He said his name was Ian. He asked to sit because the place was crowded, and I let him. At first he acted normal. Casual questions, light conversation, nothing strange. But he watched me too closely, like every detail mattered. I tried to ignore it. The tarot reading popped into my mind, pushing me to keep talking. The longer we spoke, the more obvious his focus on me became.

He leaned forward every time I answered something, like he needed to store it permanently. When he asked me out, I hesitated. Without the tarot reading, I probably would’ve said no. But the pressure of the prediction made me accept.

He smiled in a way that didn’t match the situation. Something in my stomach tightened, but I ignored it. The day of the date arrived, and the tension built inside me before I even left my apartment. Not a panic—just a heavy discomfort that made everything slower. But I pushed myself out the door anyway.

At the restaurant Ian greeted me like we had known each other for years. He talked endlessly, barely letting me speak. The whole time his eyes stayed on my face, almost unblinking. The discomfort in my chest grew steadily, a pressure that made it hard to sit still. Before the food arrived, he said we should leave. I told him I preferred staying. His smile vanished for a second, replaced with a controlled irritation that he forced back almost instantly. He pushed again, and this time his tone was firm, expecting me to follow.

By the time we finished dinner, I knew I didn’t want to go anywhere with him. But when we stepped outside, he walked close to me, too close, guiding my steps without touching me. My breathing tightened. I told him again that I was going home. He didn’t react to my words at all. The tension spiked when he gestured toward his car with an expression that wasn’t a smile anymore. It was something colder, practiced.

My body tensed even before his hand touched me. When I hesitated, he grabbed my wrist. His grip wasn’t violent. It was controlled, precise, like he was used to handling people. I tried to pull away, but he held me firmly and told me not to make things complicated. My pulse jumped. He pushed me into the car before I could shout or reach for anyone. My head hit the seat, the door slammed, and the locks clicked.

The sound made my stomach twist. I tried the handle even though I knew it was useless. He drove in silence, calm, focused, confident. That terrified me more than anything. Someone who panics might make a mistake. Someone who stays calm has done it before. When we arrived at his house, he dragged me inside without rushing, like he had all the time in the world. He locked the door, turned toward me, and said the words that froze me in place: I’m not letting you leave.

The room he kept me in was ready long before he met me. Metal bolts, a thin mattress, chains, hooks. He didn’t hesitate to explain everything. He talked casually about the women he used to bring home and kill. He said he planned to kill me too, but once he saw me up close, he wanted something different. The tension became part of daily life. It built every time I heard his steps. Every time he opened the door. Every time he sat in front of me and talked for hours about things I didn’t want to hear. He forced routines on me. Eating schedules. Sleeping hours. Tasks. Punishments. When he hurt me physically, he didn’t shout or enjoy dramatic reactions.

He watched me with quiet focus, as if studying how much I could take. Sometimes he left me in the dark for days. Sometimes he dragged me out to clean or cook. Sometimes he said nothing at all, which was worse because I didn’t know what was coming next. Months passed, then years. The world outside faded. My mind shrank into the small space he allowed me to have. The tension never stopped—it just changed shape. At some point his presence became the only stable thing left. The silence when he was gone felt heavier than the pain when he was there. One night he admitted he almost killed me on the first day. He said keeping me alive was more interesting.

He said he liked how I behaved. He said I belonged in the house. I didn’t argue. I didn’t have anything left inside me strong enough to argue. He kept killing other women. He didn’t hide that. Sometimes he made me listen. Sometimes he made me clean. He said he never got tired of watching people fail to escape. He told me I never failed the way they did. The police came after almost four years. The crash of the door shook the whole house. I didn’t know if it was real. For a moment I thought Ian planned it as some kind of test. The panic rose so fast I couldn’t breathe. When officers burst into the room, the lights felt too bright. They pulled me out, wrapped me in a blanket, and told me everything was going to be alright. I was safe now. They dragged me through the hallway.

Every corner of the house felt unfamiliar, like I had forgotten how doors were supposed to look. When they opened the front door, I froze. Ian was on the ground outside, pinned by two officers. He wasn’t fighting. He wasn’t scared. He just stared at me with the same calm expression he always had. My body leaned forward without meaning to. An officer blocked me, telling me to keep moving, but I couldn’t take my eyes off Ian.

When they lifted him up and pushed him into the car, the pressure in my chest became almost painful. At the hospital, a doctor tried to explain why I kept asking where Ian was. I barely answered him, but he kept talking. He mentioned how long-term captivity affects the brain. He said my reactions were common. He finally used a term that made everything go quiet for a moment. He said it was Stockholm syndrome. I didn’t say anything. The word didn’t make the tension go away. It only made me feel even more pulled in two different directions.

They released me after a few weeks. Everyone talked about recovery and rebuilding, but none of it felt real. The outside world was too open, too unpredictable. Nights were the worst. The silence didn’t sound right. It wasn’t the silence I was used to. I read about Ian’s trial. They listed everything he did to the others. Names, dates, evidence. It didn’t push him away from my mind. It only made the pressure in my chest return stronger, like something unfinished. After a few days I asked when I could visit him. The staff acted uncomfortable, but I insisted. I didn’t bother explaining.

I didn’t know how to explain it. When I finally sat in front of him behind the glass, he smiled like nothing had changed. My chest tightened instantly. The room felt strangely familiar. Predictable. Safe in a way that terrified me. And I sorta liked that. And to think that all started that day. I hated her for all I went through, but that Tarot woman was right about everything. I should be thankful.

1qvnbv6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qvnbv6,Quick Guide to Wonju,"Wonju is a captivating city that perfectly blends modern architecture with dramatic natural scenery, making it an ideal getaway just a short KTX ride from Seoul. 

The most iconic attraction is Sogumsan Grand Valley, where you can experience a heart-pounding walk across a massive 100m-high suspension bridge. For those seeking even more adrenaline, the ""Ul-leong Bridge"" offers a dizzying view through its glass floors, looking directly down at the rugged cliffs and river below. The valley typically operates from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM (last entry around 3:30 PM), and because it is a popular spot, booking your tickets in advance online is highly recommended to avoid long queues.

After your adventure, be sure to stop by the vibrant ""Salt Bread (Sogeum-ppang)"" cafe street located right at the valley's entrance. These cafes are famous for taking the classic salt bread to the next level, offering unique variations like sweet potato, corn, and even aromatic truffle. It’s the perfect place to refuel with a coffee and a warm, buttery snack before heading to your next stop.

To truly immerse yourself in Wonju’s nature, I highly recommend staying at one of its premier glamping sites. Wonju is a favorite destination for glamping because of its clear night skies, offering spectacular stargazing opportunities away from the city lights. Most sites provide a luxury camping experience where everything is prepared for you—comfortable beds, heating, and private BBQ facilities for a quintessential Korean grilled dinner.

I've attached maps of a cafe famous for its snowy landscapes and some of the best glamping spots, so please check them out for more details.

I was drafting notes to ensure our pet is getting proper nutrition. A week ago we had an incident where he started eating some moldy trash and that made me want to learn ***everything*** to avoid another expensive visit to bother the local vets

*If I missed something, or if I got something wrong, please share with me. I don't have a vet degree, I just got time and some old books to work from...*

Below is a little list from my personal notes to show all somethings to keep away from your dogs. I had some more good ones about bathing the dog but I will just list the food ones I drafted for our man of the house..

**Chocolate** \- has ***theobromine*** which has traces of caffeine, which dogs cannot metabolize properly. Causes vomiting, tremors, seizures, heart failure, and can be fatal..

**Grapes** Toxic to dogs in any amount. Can cause sudden kidney failure(this one was a surprise to me and my wife..) **Applies to raisins too!**

**Onions** contains a composition that damages red blood cells, leading to anemic issues. Toxic raw, cooked, or powdered..(once again..)

**Garlic** Same risk as onions but more concentrated. Can cause anemia and stomach irritation for the dog.

**Xylitol (artificial sugars get called that)** Triggers rapid insulin release(like when we eat a lot of candy for example) causing dangerous drops in blood sugar and potential liver failure.

**Coffee and caffeine** Stimulates the nervous system excessively. Leads to restlessness, rapid heart rates, tremor, seizures, and even death..

**Macadamia nuts** Cause weakness, vomiting, tremors, and fever. Effects appear within hours

**Cooked bones** Can splinter and cause choking, intestinal blockages, or internal organ punctures to the animal

**Raw bread dough (yeast in general)** Expands in the stomach causing bloat and pain. Fermentation produces alcohol, leading to alcohol poisoning for the animal

**Avocado** Contains persin, which can cause vomiting and diarrhea. The seed ball also has a choking risk for smaller dogs

**Fat trimmings and greasy foods** Can trigger pancreatitis, a painful and life threatening condition

**Moldy or spoiled foods** Can contain toxins that cause tremors, seizures and brain damage to the dog.

**Corn cobs** Not digestible. Can cause intestinal blockages requiring surgery

**Raw potatoes**  they contain a kit if solanine which is toxic and can cause diarrhea, vomits and brain problems. In small amounts cooked and unseasoned should be fine, but I wouldnt risk it.

I mean… how is it my fault I don’t have one? All the guys in my area are either senior citizens or already dating, and if there single they don’t hesitate to tell me that black girls are “fucking ugly” and that if I was white that I’d already have a boyfriend. Which is most likely true, because all the white girls in my city are all in relationships yet there’s me still not even able to get a stupid date.

I told myself I’d wait until my dad passes to get rid of myself, but it feels like the sooner the better. I’m constantly harassed and bullied all because I’m black in a predominantly white and Hispanic town, and I’m tired of it.

Anytime I’ve asked anyone for advice they always say the same stupid things “put yourself out there” I do, I’m in multiple clubs, I go to the library every weekend as well as coffee shops, “love comes when your not looking for it” it obviously doesn’t unless your white or lucky “your not missing out on anything” “your young you have time” yet you’ve haven’t been single for more than a few months since high school, so how exactly are you going to tell me what exactly I am or am not missing out on?

Now don’t get me wrong the race of everyone for me doesn’t matter we’re all people, yet everyone my age in my town makes everything about race and it’s so fucking frustrating.

I’ve never been someone valentine and I never will be, I hate the stupid holiday. Everyone said it’s easier for women, yet here I am. and it’s slowly at away at me since high school and I’d rather just do it now. I prayed to go the last few months to just take me away, and he isn’t. So I’ll have to do it for him. Maybe I’ll even attempt to bleach my skin that way I fit in when I’m gone.

God always gives good things to horrible people, but will allow those who won’t even attempt to harm others physically or with their words nothing but suffrage. Does he understand the he drives people to want to d13? We’re supposed to pray to him, yet when asked for guidance to the right path he won’t even budge or show a sign. Yet horrible people will pray to have a good life and have a family later on yet they’re granted it. What a fucking losing game god has created.

And all the dumb posts about relationships on apps, are always men asking about sex and when they should start having it, why there partner won’t have it as much as they want to, or how they have premature ejaculation. Like holy fuck just…

If i don’t get rid of myself then I’m either subject to forever to be chronically single or a fucking body men use but label as a “relationship”. It’s just always sex sex sex with them, I just want to be gone already.

I intend to do it later tonight after I get home from work, I’ll walk home today instead of driving. And I’ll just walk the hiking path and do it there.

And honestly I don’t expect anyone to comment on this, no one ever does. Every time I’ve posted on her while everyone else is getting the whole “don’t do it” and motivating comments mine are always overlooked. Not even strangers want to try and help me, shows that I’m not meant to be here.",2,1770208120.0,depression,0,1.0,False

I wokeup early and took a walke through coffee plantations, spent mt time with a peaceful river then visited a couple of waterfalls and viewpoints. The trails were easy and the air was fresh and it felt like a proper break from city and office life without having to rush between places.

What I enjoyed most was the calm perfect for solo travel. I could slow down to take photos and sit by the water and just enjoy nature without feeling crowded or pressured by any of strict schedule.

If you want a full experience of nature filled, relaxing one day or more escape in Karnataka, this route works really well and it’s the kind of experience highlighted in places like RiverMist Resorts at the end of many travel packages.",1,1770207923.0,u_Key-Badger5677,0,1.0,False
1qvn5zh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anti_Opus_Dei/comments/1qvn5zh/opus_deis_sneaky_tactics_and_lies_to_fool_its/,Opus Dei's sneaky tactics and lies to fool its members and the bishops,"The history of Opus Dei is literally its history of avoiding accountability by bishops and operating as a law unto itself. In this process, the prelature has become adept at a number of sneaky tactics - effectively lies - to give the impression to the church of being above board and to discredit opponents, especially ex-members. I am sure I know less than 1% of these tactics but here goes with some of them, gleaned from my knowledge of Opus Dei both in and out of the organisation.

**Lie 1: members have always had access to the Statutes of Opus Dei**

The Statutes of Opus Dei date from 1982 when the prelature was established by the pope. I was in Opus Dei between 1995 and 2004. I never received a copy nor heard of anyone else receiving one. I heard from one ex that they asked the director of the centre where they lived for a copy when they were in but this request was refused as irregular.

Now, actually, the Statutes were always available in centres but no one told us or if they did, it was casually in passing, in a way that wouldn't have sunk in as meaningful or helped us to enquire about them. I learnt last year that they were available in an annex of this book [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Canonical-Fernando-Fuenmayor-Gomez-iglesias-Hardcover/dp/B01182V8AE](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Canonical-Fernando-Fuenmayor-Gomez-iglesias-Hardcover/dp/B01182V8AE) ""The Canonical Path of Opus Dei"". This glossy hardback picture book was on the coffee tables of the main lounge of all the centres of Opus Dei I lived in. This lounge would probably have been used for entertaining any visiting clerics or others. I never really thought about why it was there when I was in Opus Dei.

I suspect that Opus Dei leaders, when challenged, would be able to construct a clever narrative that the members of Opus Dei have always had easy access to the statutes because they were in this book and have a clear recollection of discussing this book in some get-togethers with members at some point when there was an orchestrated, triumphant conversation on Opus Dei's path to becoming a prelature. 

No doubt also, some selected parts of the Statutes were explained in the set of oral talks for new members when we joined. In my time, there was never any access to the outline documents used by leaders for these talks nor any handouts given to me. Throughout my time in Opus Dei, I did not receive a single document evidencing my supposed membership of Opus Dei, my obligations to the prelature and its obligations to me. 

**Lie 2: members can understand the Statutes of Opus Dei**

The statutes of Opus Dei were written in church Latin and not available in English until May 2022 - see the official Opus Dei website [https://opusdei.org/en/article/statutes-of-opus-dei-eng/](https://opusdei.org/en/article/statutes-of-opus-dei-eng/)

So I have to concede that they are easily available in English now, but I still wonder if Opus Dei leaders draw them to the attention of members.

As for the period up to 2022, I defy even a cardinal to make sense of the turgid, complex, degree-level Latin, never mind an ordinary lay member of Opus Dei. But if challenged, the prelature could say - we teach Latin to all members on annual courses and in the ""centre of studies"" to celibate members, which is true. But the level of Latin I learnt there is lower than GCSE school Latin (I got an ""A"" in 1986). I was the only English layman who had even this minimal level of Latin. And we were not taught Latin to understand the Statutes. The Statutes were never mentioned. The only purpose I think for learning Latin for celibates was to understand the mass in Latin.

Note also that the article says that it is ""*an unofficial English translation of the official* [*Latin text*](https://opusdei.org/en-uk/article/statutes-of-opus-dei/) *revised by Fr Paul Hayward.""* Fr Paul is a numerary priest of Opus Dei from England. If he and Opus Dei's official website cannot come up with an official translation, then no one can. Of course, leaving the translation unofficial could give OD extra wiggle room when challenged on the interpretation of the original Latin.

If Opus Dei members really knew their own statutes, they might start to work out the areas in which obedience is demanded of them but which are not authorised under the statutes e.g. celibates handing over their salaries. They might then be able to compare the statutes with canon law and notice some huge inconsistencies e.g. prelatures in canon law (canon 296) consist only of clergy while in the statutes, the prelature of Opus Dei consists of clergy and lay people.

**Lie 3: everyone knows that Opus Dei defers to bishops in areas of universal canon law**

Lie 3 underpins a bigger lie, which the prelature and the bishops have constantly parroted, namely that Opus Dei is exclusively under the authority of the pope and so the bishops can do nothing to hold Opus Dei to account for its endless litany of abuses.

If one could have understood the Latin text of the statutes before 2022, then one might have exhaustingly reached almost the end, from section 171 onwards, in which this deference to bishops is set out.  Universal canon law covers things like the ban on the ""induced manifestations of conscience"" and restricting confessors in canon 630, which Opus Dei have always flouted egregiously, even to this day.

This section of the statutes is arguably well placed to be hidden in plain sight, a long exhausting way in, but not quite at the end if you had skimmed quickly to the end.

The prelature submitted a copy of the Latin statutes to the archives of each diocese and so can semi-plausibly say that bishops, with their obviously mighty command of legal and church Latin (!), have always had access to them. I even have a copy of a letter from Fr James Pereiro, a numerary priest then in Oxford, around 25 years ago, to the archbishop of Birmingham who had queried with him the relations between bishops and Opus Dei. Fr James referred to the copy of the statutes in the diocesan archive without actually giving any detail to the archbishop. There was no further correspondence. Nice one.

**Lie 4: members of Opus Dei have access to bishops and diocesan priests**

Occasionally, I may have seen a diocesan priest being given a tour of a centre that I lived in but always with a priest of Opus Dei and I had no meaningful conversation with any.

As for bishops, I never heard of any visit but I have seen accounts of them since I left. What I suspect is that I was at work at the time and not told about such visits or they didn't happen in my time at any given centre. Obviously, as a clearly troubled member of Opus Dei, my mere presence could have alerted the bishop to my troubles and been embarrassing for the prelature.

But of course, the Opus Dei leaders can say now that they invited bishops into the homes of celibate members of Opus Dei on request or at regular intervals.

**Lie 5: Opus Dei has an internal court of ecclesiastical abuses**

This article from a priest of Opus Dei, the media officer in Belgium, Fr Stéphane Seminckx notes the existence of this tribunal at footnote 4 (English translation from French below):

[http://www.belgicatho.be/archive/2019/01/14/opus-dei-focolari-legionnaires-du-christ-des-sectes-dans-l-e-6120702.html](http://www.belgicatho.be/archive/2019/01/14/opus-dei-focolari-legionnaires-du-christ-des-sectes-dans-l-e-6120702.html)

*""\[4\] The Prelature of Opus Dei has a tribunal, like other similar institutions of the Church (dioceses, etc.). Among other powers, this tribunal guarantees the rights of the faithful of the Prelature against possible abuses of authority. As is customary in such cases, the appeals body of this tribunal is not composed of judges who are members of Opus Dei; in this instance, it is the appeals tribunal of the Vicariate of Rome.""*

I don't know when this tribunal was set up. But I certainly never heard the slightest mention of it in my time, which post-dated the establishment of the prelature by 13 years. I checked with two current numeraries. One had heard a vague mention of it but not how to apply to it. His complaints to the prelature were not even acknowledged, never mind referred to this tribunal. The other numerary is a prestigious academic lawyer but he had not heard of this tribunal either.

There is no mention of this tribunal anywhere on the official [opusdei.org](http://opusdei.org) website or when I Googled.

It's likely that this tribunal exists only in the creative minds of Opus Dei press officers under pressure to sound like Opus Dei follows church law and practice. Of course, if someone really insisted on filing a complaint with that court and went public, I would expect the prelature to rustle up a procedure and judges, as if they had always existed.

**Looking for corroboration?**

If you want corroboration of any of the above, feel free to go to r/opusdeiexposed \- an English-speaking forum for exes of Opus Dei - and ask in a post. If you're then brave, ask current members of Opus Dei what they know about these things. Let us know here in the comments how you get on!

1qvn460,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheapfaremart/comments/1qvn460/valentines_day_travel_tips_for_us_travelers/,Valentine’s Day Travel Tips for US Travelers ❤️,"Valentine’s Day trips in the US can be great—or unnecessarily expensive and stressful if you don’t plan smart. Whether you’re flying cross-country or doing a short getaway, these tips can save you money and frustration.

**1. Avoid Flying on February 14 (If Possible)**

In the US, flight prices and hotel rates spike right around Feb 14.

Better days to travel:

* Feb 12–13 (Friday/Saturday)
* Feb 15–16 (Sunday/Monday)

Same experience, fewer crowds, lower prices.

**2. Skip the “Instagram” Cities**

Places like NYC, Vegas, Miami, and Napa are packed and overpriced during Valentine’s week.

Good US alternatives:

* Smaller coastal towns (Oregon, Carolinas, Gulf Coast)
* National park gateways
* Mountain cabins or lake towns
* Quiet Southwest or desert destinations

Less traffic = better trip.

**3. Book Experiences Early (Hotels Can Wait)**

In the US, Valentine’s activities sell out faster than rooms.

Book early:

* Spa appointments
* Wine tastings
* Scenic tours
* Shows or cruises

Hotels usually have more last-minute flexibility than experiences.

**4. Avoid Valentine’s Day Restaurant Traps**

Most US restaurants push expensive prix-fixe menus on Feb 14.

Smarter options:

* Valentine’s lunch instead of dinner
* Eat out on Feb 13 or Feb 15
* Order takeout from a great local spot
* Cook together (especially in Airbnbs)

Cheaper, quieter, and usually better food.

5. US Airport Tips for Couples

Travel stress can kill the vibe fast.

Helpful tips:

* Don’t sit middle seats unless necessary
* Download movies/podcasts before flying
* Pack snacks (airport food lines are brutal)
* Carry-on only if possible

Waiting at baggage claim is not romantic.

**6. Solo Travelers: This Is a Great Time to Go**

If you’re traveling solo in the US:

* Prices drop right after Feb 14
* Airports are calmer
* Destinations feel more relaxed

Valentine’s travel isn’t just for couples.

**7. Keep It Simple**

You don’t need big plans.

Small things work:

* Sunrise or sunset walk
* Coffee run together
* Road trip playlists
* Phone-free time

Low expectations = better memories.

**8. Plan One “No-Agenda” Day**

US trips often get overpacked.

Leave one day open to:

* Wander
* Nap
* Explore casually
* Do nothing

Those days usually end up being the best part.

**Final Thought**

For US travelers, Valentine’s Day trips are best when you avoid peak days, avoid crowds, and keep plans flexible. Romance comes from being relaxed—not rushing between reservations.

1qvn2cg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qvn2cg,Pictures of a set of the Zenphos Press editions of CoAAoD,"As promised here’s some pictures of the books that manifested Ex Nihilo on my coffee table! (Well were delivered by Amazon after being Printed in Japan if I cleave strictly to the truth). Cost wise, they’re not cheap. It’s one thing to defend them as “hey not too bad with inflation taken into consideration” and another thing to put your virtual hand into your digital pocket to pay for a set in meat space. Quality is good, and the writing is Hugh, but even so “I feel heart pain” to use a colloquialism common in Singapore.

The books are bigger in terms of frontage but slimmer in the spine than the Corgi editions, and the covers and art look nice. Put together there is a pleasant flow of the titles, Hugh’s name and logo(with one exception that I’ll get to in a bit -good news first).the artwork has a nice effect where it sort of bleeds into the spine(looks like an inverted mirror image) before it softens, and the colour flows to the back, giving a cool effect. (I will need to organise them to fit the spectrum of visible light on my shelf, but there are no numbers so ok). While we’re on the spines the bad, book six has the title from the front with one “W” and it mildly breaks my OCD as it looks offset, I’ve let the publisher know. You might want to hold off on buying this one until it’s fixed.

Inside paper quality is good, much better than Corgi’s but while it looks really nice(even compared to Colin Smythe’s editions) thought it deist feel quite so good as the hardback edition which used much nicer paper than Corgi(kind of explains why there were only four of them).

There are three forewords and one afterword from three people Jeremy, Stuart and some guy called Adrian… They all share a love and regard for Hugh’s work, so this is a nice addition. And there is at least one new illustration from Steve Crisp. These are nearly as closely related to the action they illustrate as are the covers, or maybe even closer. I’ll leave you to set the metrics, parameters and dimensions on that last sentence(especially for sparing the blushes of those traitors to the King who prefer the US covers) .

Ironically, I don’t know if I’ll actually read them in  anger, as I kind of know what happens… but I’m sure that I’ll dip into them and they’ll look good on the shelf, probably between the bongo drum and the Kurobuta stuffed animal/soft toy, this last dependent  on which version of English you have a subscription for… ",2,1770207559.0,hughcook,0,1.0,False
1qvn1ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_2Hot4Handling/comments/1qvn1ig/breaking/,Breaking,"David woke up in a big empty bed. It was night and there was misery.
He couldn’t remember when it started, but ever since, he couldn’t get a full night of sleep. Taking a sip of water from his bedside mug, he tried to get this meaningless dream out of his mind. The same dream of this strange room. An old wooden cabin, empty except this shiny golden cage in the dead center of it. David shook his head and turned on the little light on his nightstand. As he ran his hand all the way through his ruffled hair, it was barely long enough to cover the birthmark at the stem of his head, a sharp pain ran through his body. Confused, he quickly jerked his arm away from his body. His eyes immediately started examining his hand. He had discovered that little rash at the tip of his pointer finger days ago. Back then he thought he got in contact with something he was allergic to. But instead of getting better with time, that rash seemed to worsen for no apparent reason.

A deep breath ran through David’s chest. There is no reason in worrying about something so small and absurd, he thought. The hours till he gets ready for work, he spent on the phone to distract himself. After all, why should a weird dream ruin his whole day?

In a dark wooden cabin, a golden cage was shaking lightly.

---

David woke up in a big empty bed. It was night and there was misery.

The light sting in the back of his head woke him up. He must have kept scratching it unknowingly while he was sleeping. The sharp burning sensation was keeping him from going back to sleep, so he decided to stay up for a while. After turning on the light and doing his morning stretches, David looked at himself in the mirror. His eyes immediately went to his arm. The little rash that started at his fingertips now took over his entire lower arm. With shock, he blinked forcefully and rapidly as if he wanted to check if he was truly awake. Maybe he really should have a doctor look at this. He could feel a light tremble in his hands; was it the lack of sleep? As he was reaching for his mug, still filled with old coffee from yesterday, it slipped out of his grasp and shattered on the floor. While he bent down to pick up the shards of ceramics, his glimpse fell back towards the mirror. David couldn’t really tell, but the birthmark at the base of his skull became a festering scab.

In a dark wooden cabin, a hand reaches through the golden bars.

---

A loud scream tore through the silence. David jerked up out of his dream. Was he awake? Did he sleep at all? With a clumsy swing, David hit the lamp on his nightstand and brought some light into the darkness. While getting out of bed, a sharp gasp escapes his throat. His whole body was sore and in pain. Suddenly, his eyes were pulled in towards his pillow. It was drenched in blood, some very old, some new. Panic consumed David’s mind. He didn’t know what was going on. Unbelievingly, he ran his shaky fingers through his hair. Without any resistance, tufts of hair stuck in his grasp. David didn’t have to look into the mirror; his bloodshot eyes could clearly see how his skin seems to very slowly peel off of his flesh. He couldn’t go to work. He couldn’t see a doctor. All he could think about was that damn cabin. He could see it in front of his eyes at every moment; staring down on that cage.

The sun arose slowly as David made his way into the woods near his house. Why did it have to be him? With every step, his head hurt more and more. Like something is scratching the inner walls of his skull. The deeper he got into the woods, the closer he felt. He could feel it. The ground was vibrating and he could hear a firm low humming through the trees. David is pushing himself. Every step, agony. In his inner eyes he could see it clearly. The gashes in the lock, the teeth marks, the rust building on the cage. He just couldn’t bare it anymore. He needed to find it.

David couldn’t tell how long it took. Hours? Days? Time felt like it was absent. The moment he felt the most lost, he finally found it. Deep inside the dark woods he found a glade. A big empty patch where not even grass was growing. The old wooden cabin, the planks rotting away just like his weak body. He circles around the house, trying to find a window or an entrance. Nothing but a big locked door. As he tries to open the door, his body gave up. Convulsing, throwing up blood, he pushes himself to the very end. He hammers his fist against the wood, pushes his whole body against it. His panting breaths turned into desperate cries as his nails try to claw themselves into the door till his fingertips left bloody streams. Screaming desperately for help, he bashed his head against the door. Pleading for release from his misery and pain as he heard the damp breaking of a lock. Fear and pain consumed him as he throws himself against the door one last time. And it went dark.

1qvn1gm,https://i.redd.it/izy2151pzghg1.jpeg,How wrong was her during Wells run?,"I'm gonna sum it for those who don't know.

In the run of Amazing Spider-Man 2022 by Zeb Wells, Mary Jane and Peter were kidnapped by Rabin, who traps them in another dimension with giant monsters that Peter can't defeat.

In that apocalyptic world, they meet Paul Rabin, the son of Rabin, the only survivor of that earth after everyone else got killed by the monsters.

He takes them to his place and Peter starts to build a device to bring them back but they get attacked and MJ, who is manipulated by Paul, uses the device on Peter and say she'll wait for him.

Returned to his world, Peter finds out that a week in that dimension is not even an hour in his, so he rushes to F4 and asks for help buy Johnny and Ben (Reed and Sue weren't aviable at the moment) tell him to wait Captain America's arrival to interrogate him about the crater made nearby him, despite Peter told them about the time dilatation.

He fights F4 and Cap and stole tech from the to build another device with Norman Osborne's help. 

It takes a month, meanwhile MJ is mad at Paul for conving her to send Peter back and punches him when he tells her to move. It takes a whole month just to talk to him. A year later, MJ and Paul meets two children and MJ decides to take them with her and she and Paul adopt the kids as their parents.

During another year, MJ falls into desperation and thinks Peter will never come back and starts proving feelings for Paul. In the end they two become partners.

2 years later (for MJ) Peter comes back and rescue her and her new family and she tells him she won't leave them.

Peter then left the city for 6 months and keeps calling MJ at the point she snaps and says to stop calling her.

Another time, at the Hellfire Gala, MJ is kidnapped by Moira-X and is threated with a cyber-hand masked as a necklace. During the Gala she meets Peter and is happy to see him and the two of them start chatting until Moira orders MJ to follow the plan. Peter and Wolverine rescue her but she's deeply traumatized and wants to go back to her kids buy Peter stops her and asks for a coffee. When she explains she can't because of Paul, he asks if she loves Paul so much to exclud him from her life and she snaps and tells him it's about responsability.

Time passes and Rabin comes back to sacrifice MJ but fails and die. He reveals the kids where chains made to bind with MJ, alluding to a possible influence/ mind control.

After this, she starts to be happier with Peter around and slowly reconnects to him and breaks up with Paul after realising she never loved him.

One of Marvel editors, Jordan White, affirms the relationship with Paul was made by trauma bonding due to the apocalyptic world and the kids. When removed, the relationship has no more basis where to stand and she ends it with no remorse.

Keep also in mind the whole 'MJ trapped in another dimension' came much later the beginning of the run. At the beginning, we only have the phone calling, the gala and another couple of moments where she's angry at Peter, but so was everyone else, Captain America, Fantastic Four, May, Miles and so on, because it was hinted Peter did something so awful that EVERYONE hated him.

On the Spider-sub there're fans divided about her behavior and if she cheated or not on Peter.

Personally, I don't think she cheated because she didn't even know she was in a relationship at that time, let's add gaslighting (by Paul who kept telling her Peter wouldn't come back), eternal influence/brainwashing (the fake kids) and trauma bonding (4 years in an apocalyptic world) and it doesn't sound as an affair. Especially because it's very similar to Cast Away in a sense.

1qvn1cg,https://i.redd.it/8d6cfsslzghg1.jpeg,A Child of Two Worlds,"Good morning! In honor of our recent frosty, snowy weather—

It’s 4AM and I’m standing on a dock. Harborside lights illuminate the crystal-clear water, where I can see small bait fish flit about, while a crab scuttles to hide in the shadows. At that moment, I am less interested in marine life than I am the depth of the water. I know we need at least a half-tide to make it over the creeping sandbars that continually infiltrate the channel. Many a morning was spent peering into the depths, awaiting the moment when we could depart.

My Dad was a commercial sea scallop fisherman. His boat was a thirty-foot long wooden dragger, built in 1931. She was a modest working vessel, with the well-worn, slightly dingy look that typified most fishing boats. A symphony of aromas accompanied her wherever she went: a pungent mixture of old fish, diesel exhaust, and paint. Her pilot house was outfitted with a compass, fathometer, VHF radio, and wind-up clock. Down below and forward, an old-fashioned cast iron stove, fold-down table/pantry, and a berth made for a cozy little cabin. A large coffee can served as the head (toilet) for anyone who did not wish to make their deposit over the gun’ale.

I accompanied Dad on these outings whenever possible. As a kid raised in a semi-famous “Sea Captain Town”, it was almost impossible to avoid at least some familiarity with the nautical world, but my childhood was well-steeped in it. And I was hooked from the start. I loved everything to do with boats and being on the water. Dad usually fished alone unless accompanied by a family member or friend, so when I was first invited to go out scalloping at age eight (after pleading to be allowed to go for some time), I was thrilled. The hours were long, but as a “day boat” that returned to harbor by nightfall, the trips were less onerous than those of bigger offshore boats.

We left as soon as the tide permitted and I made bacon and eggs for our breakfast while we steamed to the grounds. The stove was probably intended to be fueled with wood, but as I recall, we most often used cans of ethanol gel for cooking. The stovetop had a clamp system called fiddles that kept pots and pans from suddenly levitating or taking flight across the cabin while we were underway. The fiddles also allowed the cook to use both hands when tending food, and sometimes, to brace against the carnival ride-like motion of the boat.

Later, fortified by a hearty breakfast and still plunging along, we washed the dishes. The plates and silverware were washed in the shucking box, but most of our dinnerware had holes in it, so the skillet, ironstone coffee mugs, and spatula had a line run through the holes and after being tied-off, were thrown over the side to be scrubbed as we forged ahead to our destination. Following a period of being subjected to a saltwater-and-sand scouring, we hauled back on the rope, and the sparkling-clean items were dried and stowed.

Sea scalloping involves towing a drag across the ocean floor in strategic areas. With luck, you will have found a few good scallop beds, and if you’re careful not to overfish them, you can alternate between these beds indefinitely. After the drag comes up, its contents are dumped onto the deck and the pile is culled for scallops, which are then shucked while the drag is returned to the water. This cycle of drag down/drag up goes on all day, but we must stop in time to steam back to the harbor to catch the evening tide.

Days worked on the water are unlike any day on land. It is almost as though you have been transported to another world. Time moves at its own speed, measured by the cadence of the waves, and the duration of each tow along the seafloor. On pleasant days, the breeze whispers softly in rigging and the moist salt air refreshes the skin. That said, there were many bitter cold days when the biting wind caused what we called “wind burn” and I envied my father his beard!

I was scalloping with Dad on a winter’s day when the snow began to fall fast and thick. The seas were relatively calm, but it was quite cold. As mentioned before, Dad had a full beard, and it was coated with frost, his mustache edged with icicles. The snow stuck to us as we worked, until we more closely resembled a pair of Yetis than a couple of humans. I may have been twelve or thirteen years old at the time, but I still vividly recall how thoroughly chilled I was, especially considering it was difficult to do that kind of work while wearing gloves. I knew Dad had to be cold as well.

“Dad,” I said, having had an epiphany, “Do you want a cup of hot chocolate?”

He answered with a decisive affirmative, so I was down below in a flash to boil water. These days, when I make hot chocolate, I cook it on the stovetop from individual ingredients. (Recipe below.) This was just instant cocoa, but the ironstone mugs made wonderful hand-warmers, and it felt so luxurious to sip the piping-hot beverage as I thawed my fingers. There’s a great sense of camaraderie that comes from standing together on a gently heaving deck, listening to the engine labor as the boat leads the drag on yet another pass, silently enjoying a simple cup of cocoa. The drag would be hauled up shortly, but this few minutes’ respite was priceless as snow swirled around us; no one else was in sight – we were just two people on a little boat as it plowed across a vast expanse of green water.

Some part of me will always be a fisherman’s daughter: the kid who drew pictures of fishing boats in art class, while the other kids drew horses, cars, and houses; the kid who went to school with dried scallop guts and blood on my oil skins (raincoat).

I haven’t worked in the fishing industry for many years now, but it was an important part of my upbringing, and it made my living for some decades. I am past the point in life where I would want to return to that occupation, but I still wax nostalgic on occasion for the smell of the ocean and freedom of riding the waves. I hope I have passed on this affinity to my children, who were exposed the ocean and boats literally from the time they were babies.

It was my fate that I should be drawn to two very different worlds: the call of the sea and the grounding effect of living a terrestrial life. And I harbor a deep and abiding love for both.

Commercial fishing and working in boat yards have also influenced my writing, especially as it pertains to my current book series. Not only because I worked almost exclusively with men, but because of the insights gained from working with men who labored in one of the most physical and dangerous occupations known. Surely, our early ancestors would have shared at least some of their views on the pursuit of prey (whether fish, fowl, or mammal) and the risks involved with the less-than certain lifestyle and empathized with the discomforts that come with exposure to the elements, no matter what form they may take. All such challenges are timeless.

I hope all is well in your corner of the world! 🌞

1qvn0as,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qvn0as/i_38m_am_struggling_with_my_emotionally_immature/,I (38M) am struggling with my emotionally immature girlfriend (31F) and our imbalanced relationship,"My gf (31W) and i (38M) are living together in a shared flat with two others. We met each other when i moved in there. We're ""officially"" together for maybe half a year now, but we had something going on since mid 2024. In some aspects we match so good, in others we are so very different.   
  
I'm an introverted, very rational, special interest type of guy, organized and with a little helper syndrome. I am very solution-oriented. I need routine and balance in my life and harmony around me, and my friends would say i'm a little autistic in some ways. I can be emotionally ""dry"", meaning in arguments or when reacting to emotional behavior i'm just very rational when i'm expected to be empathetic (not because i don't want to but because i'm bad at it and i think it doesn't lead to a solution). I know that can come across as rude, but it's never meant like that. 

My gf is outgoing, empathetic, emotional, people-pleasing, chaotic, a bit blue-eyed and always has something going on. She also has very prominent ADHD traits (poor time management, chaos, forgetful, hyperfocus, impulsive, constantly missing deadlines, needs body doubling or special treatment to get anything important done, constantly receiving reminders/warnings for late payments, it takes ages to find motivation to start with something, problems depending on each other are piling up, etc..), anxiety and insecurity issues and what i would describe as emotional immaturity. 

We are both sex-positive and have both had some experience with previous toxic/emotionally exhausting relationships. 

So, most of the time her emotional state is only stable until our next argument and these arguments and little fights happen almost every day and often come out of nowhere. Very small arguments can turn into a whole mess in an instant, one word or sentence can make her super angry and/or ruminate about it for hours and lose herself in insignificant details or specific wording. It gets much worse when she's around her period and she has PMS symptoms every month. Her reactions often feel very disproportionate to the situation, it's less about what happened and more about what it triggered inside her. 

She's defensive, she finds it hard to accept criticism without reacting. The gentlest, most carefully worded feedback can get mixed up in her mind and lead to anger or tears and when she starts defending or explaining herself, she's in such an intense state that is often overwhelming and makes me unable to find words and properly explain my point of view. She can ""out-talk"" me easily. Arguing with her exhausts me and drains my energy quickly, sometimes to the point where i need to tell her i'm sorry i can't talk any more about this and/or i have to leave the room because her agitated behavior is making me uncomfortable and prevents me from collecting my thoughts. 

She has a hard time owning her mistakes, instead she will often find an excuse or reframe the whole thing a bit so it looks like it's not that bad. More than once i found myself feeling like i am being manipulated into feeling guilt or bad about myself, and having to give her the affection she wants in that moment when i actually don't want to give in to her. 

She is blue-eyed in a sense that she's a bit gullible, extremely open-hearted and bad at understanding how her behavior is being received by others, expecially men. For example, she doesn't understand that the way she communicates with people can mislead them into thinking her being emotionally or sexually interested in them, leading to surprising situations and misunderstandings. She is sending the wrong signals without being aware of it. 

  
She is very afraid that she might not be diagnosed with ADHD which to her would mean that she's just stupid, lazy and a failure. Which she is obviously not. 



I often feel a significant imbalance in our relationship, regarding how much effort and commitment we put into it. I feel like i put more effort into it and not getting it back in a way that it feels satisfying or balanced. Sometimes i feel not prioritized enough, for example when we're spending time together she just needs to do this little thing real quick which delays everything or she has to call/text someone who had a bad situation or needs emotional support, or when we have loosely planned something in the evening and then something comes up and she needs to be there for another person or she hyperfocuses into a thing and we can't have our time together. And most of the time these things can't wait and she could never thell the people involved that she can't right now because that would make her feel like she would abandon them and she fears that they would be mad at her. 

She says her love language is empathy and listening and physical touch and so on. She also said that if i don't need a lot of empathy and active listening then it's kind of bad luck but that's how it is, like she can only provide this in particular and no real other forms of caring or showing love. I mean sure, that's maybe where we don't match, but what about all the other effort, the little things that make a relationship nice, that you just want to do to your partner? Me buying something she wants/needs when i go for groceries and bringing her little snacks, me making coffee cause she mostly sleeps in, me cleaning up stuff she forgot was there, me doing a lot of things that i would expect her to be able to do by herself but she can't do or can't do properly or just forgets. That leads to me feeling like i have to drag her behind me instead of us walking side by side in this relationship and i feel like i'm much more ready to commit to a serious, same-level relationship than she is. Which is strange because she was the one who needed me to go forward and say let's do this, let's have an exclusive, monogamous relationship (we were monogamous the whole time before, since we met and started to have sex, i think she just needed that to feel emotionally safe). 

She is also bad at making decisions, on that note. What to watch, which food to order, how we do this, when we do that, ... Then sometimes when i decide, i sense that she doesn't like it and ask her why she didn't just say the other thing that i assured her i would be fine with, and then the next argument starts because of...?? 

When i met her and got to know her a bit, it was weird at first because it felt like sometimes she acted like a teenager. This also leads to moments where i feel like i am a parent having to look after her or care about her and do grown up stuff for her. She often manages to get what she wants and i feel like she knows how to make me feel bad, not that she would use it against me big time, but i can't shake off that feeling completely. She says that she's not doing it on purpose and i think maybe that's just how she is, it comes natural to her. I do want to care about her, but as a partner on the same level, with the same responsibilities, not as a parent or a guardian or something like that. 

She is also very playful and sometimes i feel like she wants to test me, how far she can go until i snap (which never really happens cause i'm a very calm guy and even if she needs me to get angry and snap i wouldn't want to give her that and it's unnatural for me). She also said more than once that she kind of ""needs"" the drama and the arguments, which i can understand from a certain perspective. I think she needs the intensity to feel herself in a way, and she desperately wants to feel loved because she didn't get the love and care she needed as a child and teen. I have no expertise in psychology, i just feel like one of the biggest reasons for all of this is that she didn't have a proper father figure when she needed it most in the various stages of her growing up. And that may have lead to her being emotionally stuck somewhere in her late teen years.   
  
Her father wasn't really there for her, he left her family when she was about 2 years old and there's almost no contact. Her mother was struggling with money and raising her kids on her own for some time. She then had another child with another guy who became a father-like figure for my gf throughout her teenage years, but they also had their issues and she also has no real contact to him. She basically doesn't have and never had a constant and stable father figure in her life. 

She had a psychiatrist appointment recently which devastated her because they didn't tell her what she wanted to hear (her words!), meaning that she wanted the psychiatrist to reassure her about the ADHD or at least have a strong opinion about it. In a few days she has an appointment with a psychologist (which i think is better because i think right now needs to seriously talk to somebody about ALL of this), and i hope very much that she can start therapy soon because the way we're leading this relationship is REALLY exhausting and makes me unhappy and sad. 



I want to tell her all of this because i deeply care about her and want to help her, and also because i think she needs to talk about this with her psychologist. 

But i fear she might turn my concern and support against me and feel attacked and have a breakdown. ",1,1770207384.0,relationship_advice,12,0.6,False

For context, I’ve lived on the border of the two states my entire life, with my years split roughly in half between the two states. I currently live in MA. 

I think we easily ignore the fact that all of the states in NE share a wealth of similarity with each other, much greater than any perceived differences. We all love iced coffee! We all love seafood! (For the most part, sorry Vermont we love you) We all love Boston sports teams!

I do live in Mass now, but as someone raised in NH and with tons of family there, I’ve never heard anyone hate on Mass like that. There’s dumb assholes everywhere. NH has its problems, we’re all well aware.

Please though, don’t ignore that even though we struggle with conservatism locally, NH has voted blue in the last 6 presidential elections. Also, the whole libertarian thing has its drawbacks, but it also means that alongside all the guns and lack of taxes, people \*are\* in support of personal freedoms. This isn’t to say there isn’t homophobia or racism, but there is certainly a maintained respect for self expression.

Anyways, I just wanted to say something because reading all that hate yesterday made me sad. So I’m asking you guys to share things you appreciate about NH and share positive thoughts. Please don’t go into the comments just to hate. In a time where a cabal of pedophiles is breathing down the necks of \*everyone\* in the USA, we need to direct our anger at the federal government, not across state lines.

I'll describe as much as I can with what happened earlier from the moment I arrived in the clinic to the time I left because I'm just confused as ever at this point.

---

It took a while for me to update kasi I made a decision not to do anything about it (despite your advices to take her for a coffee) for ethical reasons, and I don't want to her to be in a bad position (client - doctor). Besides, she has been looking after my skin since last year. And really did an awesome job so I dont want to lose her as my doctor just yet.

I settled with that thought but what happened earlier totally pulled the rug under my feet. Hence, I am back here to ask for your opinion. I just have no one to share it with because I'm barely out of the closet.

So kanina yung appointment ako, I went there late na. I was the last patient and she waited for me so I brought some pastries. She didn't expect the pastries, and she was delighted to accept them. I wasn't saying anything but then she told me, out of nowhere: ""Alam mo, lagi kitang iniisip."" 

It caught me offguard, and what I said in return was: ""Talaga? Bakit?"" Di siya nag respond doon, then I followed her to her office. 

I sat on the patient bed tapos she stood in front of me to check my skin. Nakahawak siya sa chin ko and she gently moved my head left and right, to get a good look on the progress of my last procedure. All the while I was holding my breath because of our proximity. I was avoiding her eyes until I dared myself to meet them.

And tangina what a mistake.

I think she noticed na nag blush ako. I knew that she saw my reaction kasi naginit tenga at pisngi ko but she didn't say anything but she just smiled tapos she let go of my face, told me about our next procedure, what's happening, going to happen, etc.,

Anyway, noong tapos na siya and she asked me kung may questions ako, I pulled the trigger and asked what I wanted to know. I asked her: ""Wala, but I have an off-topic question."" She waited for me so kinonfirm ko na, ""You told me you're single diba?""

Nag nod siya then I asked teasingly na, ""Are you normally this friendly towards your clients?""

She didnt expect my question judging by the look of surprise sa face nya at di siya nakasagot. So inadd ko na lang to soften it, ""kasi if not, I think you're flirting with me. Don't get me wrong I like the attention. I enjoy our banter."" My intention was to make it playful, at the same time sort of call her out, but it landed seriously than what I intended.

Nag apologize siya and I stopped her and told her not to apologize kasi there's nothing to apologize kasi it's okay. Then she said na ""I really enjoy your company and I feel comfortable with you"" which I think is the reason why she was being friendly. But what does that mean????? Going back, during that time she lost the overly friendliness that she have for me, and became careful. Basta may shift of energy.

She lingered for a moment, yung parang may sasabihin pa kasi akala ko may i-add pa siya, but then she said she'll just be outside. So ayon she stepped out of the room to give me some time for myself. I honestly didn't want to go out kasi I was thinking if I was just overanalyzing her actions and I reacted too fast.

Noong lumabas ako nasa front desk siya may sinusulat tapos if I will exit dadaanan ko siya kasi isa lang naman ang daanan, so noong nasa tapat na nya ako, she offered to walk me hangang sa door ng clinic.

When we got out, she asked me if I'm okay. I nodded at ngumiti like how I used to para lang to take off the awkwardness and to assure her. I said, ""Yes, I'm good."" Tinanong ko siya if she is okay, nag nod lang siya tapos nagsabi na ako na, ""Ingat ka, Doc. See you next time."" Ang response nya is, ""See you, <my name>."" What I found odd is that she said my name for the first time kasi she usually calls me ma'am.

May ibig sabihin ba yon? Jesus. Are we (women) that confounding? Or ako ba ang may mali na suddenly little things mean something? Am I going crazy? 😂

I don't know what will happen sa mga susunod naming session. In hindsight, I regret speaking too soon and saying too much. Sana I played it cool muna kasi I don't even know if she's into women. If you ask me, there's really no trace in action, vibe, and appearance on her end. I don't think she knows that I am into women because I also don't give that energy. But she knows that I am single. My gay radar is not as good.

Anyway, what worries me now is that I don't know if this will change the dynamic between us.

I have never pursued women before, so I don't know what to make of our interactions. I just want to understand what it all meant without having to confront her again or anytime soon.

I have to admit that I like her. Even a lot at this point. But I also like her as my derma, respects her work, and I don't want to stop whatever we are working on together.

I can be blasé until my business with her is done. I'm used to keeping a stoic façade, but I have to admit that having her around me will challenge my resolve. Sa totoo lang this stresses the shit out of me. Haha, huhu.",5,1770207225.0,MayConfessionAko,2,1.0,False

i became homeless 8 days ago and i’ve been getting by in nicetown-tioga, philadelphia. every morning i can get a free coffee with water and a croissant from the local supermarket, which honestly helps keep me moving through the day. i saved up a bit of money and managed to get a discounted gym membership that i’m hoping i can keep paying monthly. it’s 24/7, so i go at quiet hours. i can shower there, drink water, and even work out a little, which helps me feel human again. my main goal right now is to keep that membership and stay on my feet.

things were going a bit better, but yesterday i used fentanyl one time with a good friend named john who i met out here. it gave me a really calm, quiet feeling. i know that stuff can be dangerous, so i’m trying to keep everything in moderation and not spiral. i really want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.

do you guys have any tips, resources, or advice for someone in my position? anything that helped you or someone you know would mean a lot. thanks for reading.",3,1770207038.0,homeless,2,1.0,False

1qvmuqq,https://i.redd.it/plchseg1yghg1.jpeg,I tried to “fix my life” for 24 hours. Here’s what went wrong.,"So I officially announced to myself that yesterday was “the day everything changes.”

New mindset. New discipline. New me.

I even wrote a to-do list.

Big mistake. That’s how the universe knew I was joking.

Morning:

Alarm rang. I stared at it like it personally offended me.

Snoozed it so many times it started to feel like cardio.

Healthy breakfast plan:

Oatmeal, fruits, water.

Reality: iced coffee and vibes.

Gym plan:

“I’ll go after I mentally prepare.”

Still preparing. Mentally. Since yesterday.

Work plan:

Open laptop → check email → somehow end up watching random videos about people fixing cabins in the forest.

At some point I realized:

I didn’t fix my life…

I just observed it very closely.

But good news — I didn’t completely fail.

I learned something important:

✨ Tomorrow is a very powerful day.

I start everything tomorrow.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

[\\""2026 is the YEAR!\\""  A two cup of coffee morning!](https://reddit.com/link/1qvmskv/video/f1d3nsyxxghg1/player)

# The Whole Chessboard is Moving...

For months Mark Smith has been telegraphing the same thing with zero ambiguity: **“2026 is the year.”** And now you can see why. Dual-ramp execution is underway, equipment is already on site, the **February ScAl alloy validation with Lockheed + DoD** is imminent, and the **March DFS** is being engineered for the people who actually matter — financiers, offtakers, strategic partners, and government-linked capital.

Then just recently the White House + EXIM dropped **Project Vault** — and this is the part people are going to underestimate at first. This is not a grant program. This is a **Strategic Critical Minerals Reserve** with **$11B from EXIM** and **$1.67B in seed capital** from industrial giants like **GM, Stellantis, Boeing, Corning, GE Vernova, and Google**, with \*\*\***Traxys (Who already has under contract 10% of NioCorps Scandium produciton) is** in the middle helping make the mechanism work. That’s basically the U.S. creating a “buyer + storage + liquidity engine” for domestic minerals — the exact thing banks need before they sign off on major project finance.

And the policy hammer is right behind it: Mark directly tied this to **Section 232** and the **January 14th Presidential Proclamation** — meaning the government is now openly preparing to fight price manipulation, import dependency, and foreign dominance over processed critical minerals. That’s not politics. That’s **market structure. It’s the U.S. saying: “We are done losing supply chains.”**

# So here’s the real setup from now through mid-2026: the March 2026 DFS lands → the serious offtakes/JV talks get upgraded → anchor capital tightens → Mid 2026 EXIM FID is completed → While Project Vault might just be the “demand floor” behind the whole story.

# By the time Elk Creek is producing in 2029, the question won’t be “can NioCorp sell?” — it’ll be “who gets what’s left?” Because the supply won’t be marketed… it just might all be reserved???💥

**When Choice Becomes Paralysis: Local Woman's Mysterious Condition Baffles Doctors**

**By Rebecca Torres | November 15, 2024**

Jennifer Walsh stands in front of her closet every morning at 6:15 AM. She's been standing there for forty-three minutes now, staring at the same six shirts she's owned for years. Her hand reaches for the blue one. Stops. Reaches for the gray. Stops. Her breathing gets faster. Her chest tightens. She can't choose.

By 7:00 AM, her husband Michael finds her on the bedroom floor, sobbing, still in her pajamas. He chooses the blue shirt. Helps her dress like she's a child. The relief on her face is immediate.

This happens every single day.

""Eighteen months ago, Jen was a marketing director,"" Michael tells me in their Elora home, his voice worn thin from exhaustion. ""She managed a team of twelve. Made decisions worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Now she can't decide what to have for breakfast.""

Jennifer is twenty-eight years old. She has no history of mental illness, no childhood trauma, no obvious neurological damage. But since May of last year, her ability to make even the most basic decisions has simply vanished, and no doctor has been able to tell her why.

""It started small,"" Jennifer says, her voice barely above a whisper. She sits exactly where Michael positioned her on the couch, hands folded in her lap. ""I'd stand in the grocery store for twenty minutes trying to choose between two brands of pasta. I thought I was just stressed from work. But it kept getting worse.""

The progression was relentless. Within six months, she couldn't choose which route to drive to work. Couldn't decide whether to attend meetings. Couldn't select items from a menu. Her job performance deteriorated until she was placed on medical leave. That leave became permanent in May when she missed three weeks straight—not because she was physically ill, but because each morning she couldn't decide whether to go in.

""People don't understand what this feels like,"" Jennifer says, and for the first time her voice rises slightly, frustration breaking through. ""It's not indecision like normal people experience. It's not 'should I get the chicken or the fish.' It's like my brain hits a wall. Like the part of me that makes choices just... stops existing. And the anxiety that comes with it—"" She stops. Swallows hard. ""I've tried to kill myself twice because I couldn't bear it anymore.""

Michael's jaw tightens. He reaches over, takes her hand. For the past six months, he's made every single decision in their household. What they eat. When they sleep. What Jennifer wears. Where she sits. How she spends every hour of her day.

""I know how it sounds,"" he says, meeting my eyes. ""Like I'm controlling her. Like this is abuse. But if I don't make these decisions, she just freezes. She'll stand in one spot for hours if I don't tell her what to do next. This is the only way we've found for her to survive.""

The medical community has no answers. Jennifer has been to seven different specialists. She's had MRIs, CT scans, comprehensive bloodwork, genetic testing, psychiatric evaluations. She's been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, treatment-resistant depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and—most dismissively—conversion disorder, the modern term for what doctors used to call hysteria.

""Three different psychiatrists told me it was psychological,"" Jennifer says, anger creeping into her voice now. ""That I was subconsciously seeking attention or trying to avoid responsibility. They put me on every medication you can imagine. SSRIs made it worse. Benzodiazepines did nothing. Antipsychotics made me feel like a zombie but didn't touch the core problem.""

Dr. Lisa Holmes, a neurologist at Elora Medical Center, is one of the few physicians who believed something else was happening.

""When Jennifer came to me, I'd already seen two other patients with remarkably similar presentations,"" Dr. Holmes tells me in her office, pulling up brain scans on her computer. ""Young women, no psychiatric history, progressive inability to make autonomous decisions, no response to conventional treatment. The pattern was too specific to be coincidental.""

She shows me Jennifer's fMRI scans during decision-making tasks. The images are striking—while most of Jennifer's brain shows normal activity, her prefrontal cortex, the region responsible for executive function and decision-making, goes almost dark when presented with choices.

""It's not that she's anxious about deciding,"" Dr. Holmes explains. ""It's that the neural pathway for autonomous decision-making appears to be fundamentally impaired. We can see it shut down in real-time.""

But seeing the problem doesn't mean understanding it. Dr. Holmes has consulted with neurology departments across the country. She's sent Jennifer's scans to specialists at major research hospitals. No one has a diagnosis that fits.

""The specificity is what's so puzzling,"" Dr. Holmes says. ""Jennifer can answer questions. Her memory is intact. Her cognitive function is completely normal in every other domain. It's just this one thing—the ability to make choices—that's failed.""

What makes Jennifer's case even more troubling is that she's not alone—and the numbers appear to be growing.

Dr. Holmes has now identified six patients in Elora with similar symptoms. A twenty-two-year-old college student who had to drop out because she couldn't choose classes or decide whether to attend lectures. A thirty-five-year-old accountant who lost custody of her children after child protective services determined she couldn't make basic parenting decisions. A nineteen-year-old working at a coffee shop who attempted suicide after standing frozen in front of the drink menu for so long her manager called an ambulance.

""I started reaching out quietly to colleagues in other cities,"" Dr. Holmes says. ""I'm hearing about cases in the Pacific Northwest. Reports from the Southeast. Scattered sightings in the Midwest. It's not an epidemic yet, but there's something happening that we don't understand.""

Jennifer found others through social media. A Reddit group called r/DecisionParalysis has grown from a handful of members in January to over two hundred women describing strikingly similar experiences. They share stories of worsening symptoms, doctors who don't believe them, families who think they're faking, and a medical system with no answers to offer.

""Reading those posts was the first time I didn't feel crazy,"" Jennifer says. ""All these women describing exactly what I'm going through. One woman in Oregon said she stands in her shower every morning unable to decide whether to use shampoo first or body wash. Another woman in a suburb outside Atlanta said she lost her job as a teacher because she couldn't decide which lesson to teach. It's all the same pattern.""

The online community has become both support system and informal research network. Women document their symptoms, track progression, share which treatments failed. Some report that having someone else make all their decisions provides relief from the paralysis. Others describe family members who've grown frustrated and left. Several mention suicide attempts.

""What scares me is how many of them have been dismissed by doctors,"" Jennifer says. ""Told it's anxiety. Told to try harder. Told they're attention-seeking. But we're not making this up. Something is wrong with us and nobody knows what.""

There may be hope on the horizon. Dr. Holmes mentions that Arden Research Hospital announced a study last month investigating what they're tentatively calling ""autonomic decision paralysis."" The research team is actively recruiting patients and has received funding to conduct comprehensive neurological, genetic, and biochemical analysis.

""They're taking this seriously,"" Dr. Holmes says. ""They think there might be a common underlying pathology. Something neurological we haven't identified yet.""

But studies take time. Analysis takes time. For Jennifer and the growing number of women experiencing these symptoms, time feels like a luxury they don't have.

Jennifer hasn't worked in six months. Their savings are depleted from medical bills that insurance largely refused to cover, deeming most testing ""experimental"" or ""not medically necessary."" Michael has taken on a second job. Their friends have stopped calling—too many canceled plans because Jennifer couldn't decide whether to go out. Her parents live across the country and don't really understand what's happening to their daughter.

""I just want my life back,"" Jennifer says. She's looking at her hands, fingers twisted together. ""I want to be able to choose what shirt to wear. To decide what to eat for lunch. To make simple decisions without my brain shutting down completely. Is that too much to ask?""

She looks up at me, and her eyes are desperate in a way that makes my chest tighten.

""Sometimes I think dying would be easier than living like this.""

Michael's hand tightens on hers. He makes every decision in her life now. When she eats. Where she sits. What she wears. To anyone watching from outside, it looks like control. It looks like abuse.

But Jennifer says it's the only thing keeping her alive.

""Without Michael, I'd just freeze,"" she says. ""I'd stand in one spot until I collapsed. Or I'd try again to kill myself and maybe this time I'd succeed. He's keeping me functional. That's not abuse. That's love.""

The question no one can answer yet is: what happens when love isn't enough?

I hope this is ok to post here. I recently finished my firsts scratch build, a trench cutaway I've sized to fit in my lightbox so I can take some more interesting photos of my miniatures.

It consists entirely of: Cardboard, coffee stirrers, glue, insulation cut offs, wood filler, glue, paint and a teeny bit of green stuff.

Putting it all together was a load of fun, I feel like I've learned a tonne and even if I don't do much terrain going forward, the lessons learned will still be useful for baseing in every other miniature I do.

But I want to do more. I'm thinking a few more lightbox inserts at least, a fantasy dungeon/sewer and a sci-fi megacity alley would give me a few small scale projects to tip away at and from there maybe some ""real"" terrain or some dungeon tiles...

I think I've been bitten by the bug 😅

1qvmkuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1qvmkuj/im_part_choctaw/,I’m part Choctaw,"Well my King, it went like this. My wife was out of town and I decided I’d do a solo trip for therapeutic reasons. This time the goal was to get rid of the anger and stress that had been causing it. I’ve never had a bad trip before.

I always do lemon tek after using my coffee grinder and I weighed out 5G. It took a long time to set in, not 15”, nor 30”, but around 2 hours and then holy Lord God.

I put in my earbuds and laid down on the couch with my usual playlist that is a psychedelic therapy one. It begins with this chill dude called Rahm Doss or something like that talking and then Papadosio starts playing in the background. Real nice. Then I change it up. I’m part Choctaw so I tend to trip hard when I listen to flute or drums. I pulled up some good Choctaw music.

When the drums start my visuals always begin. I see them with my eyes closed. Little guys doing this dance. Digital type dudes. Green and red, getting their groove on. Then after time has passed I move onto more tunes I like. Usually jam bands. I was dancing and having fun visuals. Some weird shit. I call my pal because now I start to have some with my eyes open. I look at the sky and it’s a matrix. The words and keypad on my phone are 3d and coming at me.

It’s cool and I go back inside. It’s probably 1 or 2 in the morning. I lay back on the couch listening to my favorite music list when Molly Tuttle comes on doing her version of White Rabbit and that’s when shit went sideways and got dark. There was like a mist everywhere. And it was like the fiddle was making this bizarre sound. It was coming at me with its sound waves. The fiddle was inter-dimensional. Pretty soon I was hearing voices in my head like a schizophrenic and seeing demon or scary like faces in my mind so I couldn’t close my eyes. I felt like I had 3 minds in me, my mind, an evil being’s mind trying take over mine, and an insane mind that might become me permanently.

I was afraid I’d be freaked out permanently. I looked for some Xanax to stop the trip, but I realized later I accidentally took my dog’s trazadone which didn’t do shit. Finally at 3am I gave in and woke up my neighbors. He is a retired cop. He even was on the drug task force, lol, he’s a good guy though. He really is. He came over. He hugged me and told me to calm down it’d be ok. He insisted on taking me to the ER.

All I wanted was to be with someone, anyone, but neither he nor his wife could stay up with me, but the very attractive young nurses at the ER could and they thought I was fucking hilarious.

To make matters worse and funnier, when they got me back there I said I needed to pee, but the main nurse wouldn’t let me walk down to the restroom nor hold the urinal to myself. She said she was going to hold “it” for me. In my head I’m secretly happy about having a woman hold my dick, but I was worried about shrinkage. I had no chance to “chub it up”  as we say in the man kingdom. What I said though was this: “you’re gonna hold it? That would be cheating on my wife wouldn’t it”. She said she would call my wife if that would make me feel better to which I replied “oh no, let’s not tell her about this”. Then all of them gathered around, seriously, and watched me pee in the urinal jug while she held it. Then she thought I was done and started pulling it away right when I shot out the final blow of piss, but she screamed as my urine got on her. She was like “you peed on me I thought you were done!” and I said “you yanked it away and almost cut me. Don’t cut off a couple inches, my wife is happy with the 6 she’s getting now”. That got an explosion of laughter from my audience and I slept for hours after that.

I can’t remember their faces. Do they remember mine I wonder? It’s not a big city. People know each other around here. Did I have shrinkage like George Costanza after swimming in cold water? Do they think I have a small dick or know I’m just average? Do they know it’s about the motion in the ocean? If I see 3 blonde nurses in that hospital look at me and giggle in the future will I know they’re the ones? Should I tell them it was cold and they shrink like a frightened turtle?

We got the ""gentle reminder"" email about being ""mindful of the office budget"" and how the pantry is getting a ""workout."" I’m sorry, what? Most of us have maybe two coffees a day and a couple of biscuits. It’s not like we’re filling a truck and loading up for the week. Apparently, having a handful of snacks is now ""replacing meals.""

Where does the micromanagement end? Next week, she'll probably start rationing the toilet paper. ""Hey team, just a reminder that some extra toilet paper is for emergencies only, please consider bringing your own tissues from home to help the budget stretch!"" Where does it end? Do I need to start paying for the electricity and water bills too?

**""But at least you HAVE a pantry!""**

I already know what some of you are going to say. I can hear the comments now: ""You’re so lucky! My office doesn't even have water!"" or ""Be grateful, a pantry is a luxury!""

Honestly? That’s such a slave mentality. This isn't a ""perk"" anymore when it’s used as a tool for micromanagement. It’s the illusion of a cool startup culture while they literally count the crumbs on your desk. Using an Rs 60 bag of snacks to guilt-trip a team of 7 people who are probably working 9-hour days is just insulting.

If your ""office budget"" is so fragile that a bag of Haldiram’s is going to sink the company, maybe we have bigger problems than my mid-day snack habit.

It’s just exhausting. You try to build something great, and you get treated like a school kid who took too many cookies from the jar.

They sat in the Kitchen eating pizza and drinking beer as the drone livestream was about to link up. Peter put it on pause.

“Bet?”

“About what?”

“What we will see. I will guess a slightly more advanced society than the capital and the palace. Maybe even firearms. And only humans, probably hiding.”

“So you think they are hiding?” She asked as she grabbed another slice.

“mmhmm. Probably hid and waited for rescue. Might even have the pods hidden away, not even knowing what they are. They must be completely drained of energy, or the satellite would have found them.”

“Okay, I’ll go the other way then. I….. I think they have made themselves into gods and rulers. Small empire. It's like four continents from that capital; he probably didn’t even know of them, or he did, and he thought I was one of them. Come to think of it, they did treat me well once I got to that Harmen room.”

“So you say they took over, and I say they hide.  What does the winner get?” He asked, and she grinned.

“The winner gets to decide what VR game we are going to play during the trip back. I upgraded Peppermints VR with the one from Darkwood.” She winked.

He reached over the table and offered his hand. “Deal!” 

They shook on it, and he reconnected, and they saw an island with tall cliffs, a green-and-blue forest covering most of it, except for a few jagged mountains in the middle.  He looked at the data, and it showed the island was 600 km2, most of it a high plateau. There were large cave systems in all the jagged mountains, and a population of 1532.

“Wait, what? 1500? What are they rabbits?” Peter said, looking at the scans.

“How many went down there? “Kiko checked the files and covered her mouth in shock.  278 passengers successfully launched. Oh my..  What are we talking about? Two or three generations? They really got busy. I tell you, this planet just makes you want to... You know.”

She giggled, and he shook his head. “Still, 1500 is not an empire, and if they joined with somebody, then they might be the majority.”

They looked at the screen as something large and blue glided into view. It looked like an ancient wooden ship attached to a giant blue hot air balloon.

“What the?” They both looked at each other and then back to the screen, then zoomed in on the ship, where they saw humans walking on the deck.  They wore full-body suits and had masks hanging around their necks. It looked more like it was for decoration than practical use. Though everybody had similar masks.

“Well, they are not an empire and are hiding, but not the way I would thought.” 

""Yeah, that is not hiding.” She replied.

“But it's not an empire either.” He countered as he sipped his beer.

“Don’t be so sure, they are probably pretending to be gods so others will bow down to them,” she said. He sighed as he looked at the screen and saw two more ships emerge from a cave inside the mountain. The drone then flew over the mountain and sent a pulse through it to search for a cave system.

They stared as the giant cave system revealed itself; these humans had hollowed out most of the mountain, creating a vast city.  The forest also hid several buildings.  The drone moved around the mountain until it found what appeared to be a docking area for the airships. They could see two other big ships being worked on as well as a few smaller ones. They had harpoons attached to the sides of the ships. 

 “Wow, that is weird. We definitely need to visit that place when we get back here.” Peter said, and Kiko just smiled, got up, walked around the table, and sat down on his lap.

“Yes, we do, and I would say I won.”

Peter met her eyes; he could not help wanting more of this woman, and she knew it.

“Yes, you did. Be gentle to me.”

She laughed. “Gentle? You think we are going to have fun on the way home? We are going to use the VR to practice killing the count. After we dump the intel and the hags, I want to take him and the whole damn organization out. He got some of my friends killed. And then I’m going after that asshole Kilroy Martinez and his crew, then it's my dad, and after that… “she kissed him passionately. “We are going back here to get my ring and make kids, or maybe we have kids already by then.”

He looked up at her, then stood up with her still wrapped around him.

“Oh my!”

“Strap in!” He looked over at Kiko, who dropped content into the seat with her morning coffee cup.

He brought up the information the AI and scan had provided. “Okay, we are at sector N7, South-West region, there is a hyperlane fifteen days from us, and from there a three-week ride to the Maginor Hub. That’s a Nalos hub; we should be safe there.”

“Damn, we are twelve thousand light-years from Sanctuary. That’s months trip home.”

Peter nodded as he plotted the course. “Well, we have a full tank and lots to do. You have to change the name of Peppermint. And we need to hire a new crew if we are going to use the ship, or we sell it and get ourselves a smaller one.”

“Sell Peppermint? Hell no! We are getting a crew.”” She looked at the star map as the system's official name came up: Inanna 6.

“What about Inanna?”

“Inanna? Sure… that’s funny… “ He looked at the information that popped up. “Unstable star and rouge Wormhole. Unsuitable for settlement or mining; approach at your own peril. … that’s why nobody approach it. not worth the risk if ever a trip there can result in getting tossed around the galaxy or a sun that will explode at a moment's notice.”

“Unstable sun? oh shit..”  She looked at him, and he chuckled as he pulled up the scans. A quite stable sun.

“I think that’s perhaps some sort of shield or tech we didn’t pick up on, or we are inside it. Now let’s go home.”

“We are coming back, right?” She said as he activated the hyperdrive, the stars became long, glowing lines against the black background.

 “Of course, I have to get you that ring.”

RC is teasing a PP 5167R Aquanaut in rose gold with a claimed 131g weight while keeping the case at 40mm × 8.2mm (they say it lines up with publicly available gen specs).

Their whole angle is basically:  
“The hard part isn’t making it heavy — it’s making it heavy *and* thin while still wearing balanced.”

What they’re claiming:

* Tungsten weighting (hard to machine, high tool wear, tight tolerances)
* Weight isn’t just “more metal” — it’s an internal weight distribution layout to control center of gravity, so it doesn’t feel lopsided / “droopy” on wrist
* Supposedly a high scrap rate to get the combo of heavy + thin + comfortable

Other details mentioned:

* Sapphire with AR coating + emphasis on proper sealing
* Dial color tuned through multiple samples to hit a coffee-brown tone
* “Gen-like” tropical composite rubber strap + RG-style folding clasp with crisp action / clean engravings

Questions for the sub:

* What do you think about this launch — real engineering upgrade or just marketing?
* Anyone have experience with RC’s recent weighted builds? 
* Do you think 131g in an 8.2mm case is realistic, or does it sound sketchy?
* If you were choosing a 5167R rep today, would RC even be on your shortlist vs other makers?

I’ve been working on a solo project called FlashBoss. It’s a RPG-style flashcard program that I've gamified as much as I can, without it being on the nose (CLI/Terminal style).



My aim is to make quality education cheap and accessible. 



When this launches, the price will be very low (coffee money), but before I release it to the wider public, I want to give keys to the Esperanto community first to see if it works for you. 



The Tool:



Distraction-free interface.

Keyboard-only navigation. (Designed ideally for Numberpad)

Designed for rapid-fire reviews.

How to get a key:

I’m managing this manually to keep things personal. Please send me a PM (Private Message) briefly mentioning why you’re interested or how you currently study. I’ll reply with a Steam Key.



You can check out the project page here: [https://odiin2024.github.io/flashboss-site/](https://odiin2024.github.io/flashboss-site/)

  
Error reports will be followed up. The game will be updated for free.

1qvmavb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qvmavb,I stopped trying to be productive at night—and my work finally got better.,"For years, I treated nights like a second workday. Coffee at 9 PM. Tabs everywhere. Guilt louder than my keyboard.

Then one night, I didn’t optimize anything. I just… let the night be quiet.

No to-do list. No “one more task.” I dimmed the lights, closed half the tabs, and wrote exactly one paragraph—slowly. It wasn’t impressive. It was honest.

Something strange happened over the next week:

	•	My mornings got sharper.

	•	My ideas felt cleaner.

	•	I stopped fighting the clock and started listening to it.

Turns out, night isn’t for grinding—it’s for digesting. For letting the noise settle so tomorrow can start clean.

I still work late sometimes. But now I ask one question first:

“Am I creating—or just avoiding rest?”

If it’s the second, I shut the laptop.

TL;DR: Treating night as recovery instead of a productivity contest made my work (and brain) noticeably better.

Everything felt heavier than it should’ve. Simple stuff took more effort and I kept telling myself I needed motivation or a better routine or to get serious again.

What I didn’t connect for a long time was how my mornings were setting the tone. I’d wake up and grab my phone without thinking. Notifications, random posts, stuff I didn’t even care about yet. Nothing dramatic but by the time I got out of bed my head already felt full. Like I’d started the day responding instead of waking up.

At some point I stopped scrolling in the morning almost by accident. Not as a challenge or a rule. I just left my phone in another room one night and didn’t bother grabbing it right away when I woke up. I made coffee, stared out the window for a bit, got ready slowly.

And the weird thing was… the day felt different. Not amazing Not productive in some intense way but just less tense. Like I wasn’t starting the day already behind.

After a few days of that, I noticed I wasn’t as exhausted by noon. Starting work didn’t feel like such a fight. I still procrastinated but it didn’t feel as desperate. My brain wasn’t fried before the day even started.

That helped my burnout more than any motivation hack I tried. Not because it fixed everything, but because it stopped me from draining myself first thing in the morning.

I still scroll I’m not anti-phone or anything. But mornings without it made me realize how much energy I was losing before I even did anything.

Turns out I didn’t need more motivation. I just needed to stop flooding my brain the moment I woke up.

oh my gosh, *what the heck!?!* that was so cute you guys 🥹

maybe I'm just extra emotional today or something, but I legit teared up and had a few tears fall when playing this new fishing side quest with Rania and her mom, Sigry. It was so adorable and heartwarming, and it felt so nostalgic; like the feeling I got playing this quest was the exact same feeling when I started playing sso all those years ago! I love that <3 (oh, and the newer fishing mechanic *slaps*!).

Plus we got a cute new top :3 I love clothing rewards lol (oh! the shillings, the player xp, *and* the horse xp is awesome as well! but esp thank you to sso for the around 400xp for our character! woohoo!)

But yeah! This quest for some reason made me incredibly emotional? Like everything from Sigry starting out cold and stressed out then warming up, to Sigry and Rania sharing memories together, to them talking towards the end about how self-care is important... *\*squeals\** and even getting our picture taken (and we get to see a little bit of us actually having our character speak lol) and then having ***us*** take a picture of them together was a cute finish as well.

I loved every bit of it!

While I'm not a daughter nor do I have a mom, especially one like Sigry, it made me yearn for the feeling of family and love and togetherness, especially for that bond between a parent and (adult) child. Today's quest had me longing and nostalgic for an experience I've never had nor will I ever have. And there's a bit melancholy in that too, tbh. I wish I could have an experience like this, as this and many other pieces of media go to show that spending quality time as an adult child with your parent is so incredibly important and unique. Like we really don't have all the time in the world, so it's important to cherish those you love. And with sso and its emphasis and messaging on friendship, sisterhood, and femininity; it's all the more important to appreciate that love and bond between a mother and daughter\*\* 🥺🥹

I dunno... Am I crazy? Does anyone else understand what I'm trying to say?  


Now, besides all the sappy stuff, lol (kudos if ya made it this far!), I thought it was cool! I liked how we went to different fishing areas and our character seemed to have an actual relationship and connection with Rania and her mom! (instead of just meeting some npc and doing a fetch quest for them for some reason)  
It honestly didn't feel too short or anything! Nor did it feel too long. It felt like it was a good length for a short side quest. Kudos sso :) I thought the line right before gathering the bugs was hilarious, ""I'll take care of the bait. I'm a pro at tasks like this."" like doesn't that sum up the majority of what we do on Jorvik? lmao. I also enjoyed that after we collected the bugs for bait, we had the option to instantly teleport to the Wildwoods so we didn't have to run there or trailer or anything. Is this a newer thing? I can't remember if there's ever been another time like that before where we had the option to teleport to the next part of a quest when it was in a different location.  


So, what are your thoughts? Do you think I'm being a bit silly for getting emotional? Did you enjoy the quest? How did it make you feel? Do you think the reward(s) are suitable for what the quest entailed and how long it was? Did you enjoy the length? Or was it too long or too short? Did you have a favorite part or memorable part you enjoyed? Any portion you didn't like all that much?

I'm also glad Dundull wasn't forgotten! I'm still hoping that maybe one day they'll add a champ to the Mistfall or Wildwoods areas, fingers crossed haha.

We live in a hustle-obsessed, filter-heavy world where “health” often gets reduced to green smoothies, 5 AM workouts, and $200 supplements. Scroll TikTok or IG and you’ll find shiny influencers telling you to “just be THAT girl/guy” without explaining what actual long-term well-being looks like. The issue? Most viral health hacks are unsustainable or straight-up misinformation, especially for people juggling work, family, and mental bandwidth.

This post is a reality check. No fluff, no elitist advice. Just solid habits that are *actually* sustainable and backed by legit research. Sourced from cognitive science, medical journals, podcasts like Andrew Huberman’s Lab, and books like James Clear’s *Atomic Habits* or Dr. Rangan Chatterjee’s *Feel Better in 5*. These eight habits look deceptively simple. But they compound. And they’re life-changing when done consistently.

Here’s the good stuff:

- Walk daily without your phone  
  Just 20–30 minutes of walking improves creativity, memory, and emotional regulation. A 2018 Stanford study showed that walking boosts divergent thinking by up to 60%. It’s not “just a walk” — it resets your nervous system. Neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman calls it ""non-sleep deep rest for your brain."" Bonus points if it's in nature.

- Go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day (yes, even weekends)  
  The American Academy of Sleep Medicine emphasizes *regularity* over duration. Sleep inconsistency messes with your circadian rhythm, impacting hormones, weight, and cognition. Even small irregularities increase depressive symptoms, per a 2020 Harvard study.

- Eat the same 3-4 healthy meals on rotation  
  Decision fatigue is real. Simplifying your meals reduces stress around food, helps with portion control, and boosts micronutrient consistency. Dr. Rangan Chatterjee advises “meal templates” to help clients stay healthy without being obsessive.

- Sit in silence for 10 minutes, no journaling, no music, just you  
  We’re overstimulated 24/7. This is mental detox. Research from JAMA Psychiatry (2022) showed that mindfulness practices reduce anxiety as effectively as medication. No need to “meditate” — just sit.

- Cut caffeine after 1 PM  
  Caffeine has a half-life of ~5-6 hours. Even if you fall asleep, late-day coffee disrupts sleep quality. According to a study published in the *Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine*, consuming caffeine 6 hours before bed reduced total sleep time by over an hour.

- Have a wind-down ritual you don't skip  
  Signal your brain that the day is done. Whether it’s hot tea, reading, or stretching, the ritual matters more than what it is. Sleep researcher Dr. Matthew Walker emphasizes consistency over perfection in his book *Why We Sleep*.

- Read real books every day, even just 10 pages  
  Deep reading improves focus, empathy, and neural elasticity. A study from the University of Sussex found that reading lowers stress by 68%, beating out music or walking. Audiobooks and screen skimming don’t give the same cognitive benefits.

- Keep a “done” list, not just a to-do list  
  We’re wired to chase the next task, but rarely pause to appreciate what we’ve done. Behavioral scientists like BJ Fogg suggest “celebrating small wins” to reinforce positive habits. A done list helps track progress and boost self-worth.

These aren’t sexy, viral 30-day challenge habits. But they’re the stuff people with good energy, healthy bodies, and clear minds do daily. None require apps, willpower, or going monk-mode. Just a bit of structure.

I’ve spent the last 48 hours adding the features you asked for (Brand filters, PWA, and faster sync).","Honestly, I'm still in a bit of disbelief.

Two days ago, I posted about a small fuel price tracker I built to navigate the new government scheme. Since then, it’s been an absolute whirlwind.

**The ""Holy Crap"" Stats:**

* **130,000+ of you** jumped on the site in 24 hours.
* Cloudflare processed over **5.15M requests**.
* I've somehow hit **#1 on Google** for ""Fuel Finder"".

I've been reading every single comment, email and DM, and I’ve spent the last two nights (and way too much coffee) pushing the updates you wanted:

1. **Brand Filtering:** You can finally filter by Shell, BP, Tesco, etc. I know how important loyalty points and fuel cards are, so this was priority #1.
2. **Map Styling:** Improved the map tiles so they actually load on mobile without killing your data plan (and added a cleaner look so you can actually see the prices).
3. **The 15-Minute ""Secret Sauce"":** I’ve tuned the background sync. While the official scheme allows for 30-minute lags, my engine is now hitting the feeds and cleaning the data every 15 minutes.
4. **PWA Support:** You can now ""Add to Home Screen"" so it acts like a proper app without the App Store faff.

I’m just one dev with a £60 server budget, so seeing 4,700 people register for accounts has been wild. I've even added a small ""PRO"" tier for £1.99 just to keep the lights on and the servers from melting, but the main map will always be free and ad-free!

**Quick question for the community:** I’m currently tracking **7,868 active stations**. Is your local ""hidden gem"" garage showing up yet? If not, I really hope the Government is helping to get these Indie garages signed up.

Thanks for helping me turn a weekend project into something that's actually helping people beat the ""motorway tax"" at the pump.

1qvluh1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qvluh1,Powdered Jelly Donut (Jeni's),"**Jeni's review No. 9:** The recent Bridgerton flavor — Queen Charlotte Sponge Cake — nicked the same raspberry-rose jam that’s the star of Jeni’s Powdered Jelly Donut. It’s certainly good enough to use twice. In the Bridgerton pint, it accents a light almond base. It’s even better here, set against the rich vanilla custard. I want twice as much of it, but that speaks to the quality. And for those who, like me, worry about floral flavors, no need to fear: Like a boyfriend who forgot Valentine’s Day, there’s no actual rose to be found here.

**Does the flavor match the name?:** Sort of … not really. The raspberry does remind you of a good jelly doughnut, and the base is reminiscent of a pastry cream for a Boston Cream filled treat. But the doughnut pieces aren’t recognizable to me as such. They act as more of an enjoyable textural element. Like many Jeni’s baked mix-ins, they need to be a bit bigger so they stand out. Also, why Powdered, which doesn’t really translate to frozen dessert? Why not Raspberry?

**What I liked:** Texture-wise, this base may be my favorite from Jeni’s — it’s a similar custard to the one they used in holiday Panettonne and a few other flavors (while most Jeni’s bases are egg-free). Even though it’s not advertised as cheesecake, the small amount of cream cheese Jeni’s uses in most bases really comes through here and there’s an alluring tanginess that mixes with a bit of vanilla and salt. If you told me this was raspberry cheesecake ice cream, I’d have just as much reason to believe you as Jelly Donut.

**What could be better:** In addition to bigger mix-ins, I wanted more of the advertised brown sugar and nutmeg notes. 

**How it compares:** I had the Coffee and Doughnuts flavor recently from Sloan’s that featured Krispy Kremes. It showed you could do doughnuts successfully in ice cream. It had some small bits, but also a couple of large pieces that were chewy and delicious against the coffee. I wish Jeni would follow suit.

**Possible pairing:** Compare jam swirls with Queen Charlotte Sponge Cake or custard bases with Boston Cream Pie.

**Final thought:** While these doughnuts would never pass muster with a cop, I’ll give them a pass because overall this is one of Jeni’s most craveable flavors.

WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is expected to unveil its grandest plan yet to rebuild [supply chains of critical minerals](https://apnews.com/article/rare-earths-trump-tariffs-china-trade-war-effd6a7ec64b5830df9d3c76ab9b607a) needed for everything from jet engines to smartphones, likely through purchase agreements with partners on top of creating a $12 billion [U.S. strategic reserve](https://apnews.com/article/trump-rare-earths-china-tariffs-reserve-8238230f2bd740af3d2668e1b56155b0) to help [counter China's dominance](https://apnews.com/article/trade-minerals-rare-china-trump-5f7c9b9360cfb3cce702649e0c568a0e).

Vice President JD Vance is set to deliver a keynote address Wednesday at a meeting that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is hosting with officials from several dozen European, Asian and African nations. The U.S. is expected to sign deals on supply chain logistics, though details have not yet been revealed. Rubio met Tuesday with foreign ministers from South Korea and India to discuss critical minerals mining and processing.

The meeting and expected agreements will come just two days after [President Donald Trump](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump) announced “Project Vault,” or a stockpile of critical minerals to be funded with a $10 billion loan from the U.S. Export and Import Bank and nearly $1.67 billion in private capital.

The Trump administration is making such bold moves after China, which controls 70% of the world’s rare earths mining and 90% of the processing, choked off the flow of the elements in response to [Trump’s tariff war](https://apnews.com/article/china-united-states-tariffs-trump-trade-3a1cb2941aa7387f25befe86fbe1f1c0). The two superpowers are in a one-year truce after Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping [met in October](https://apnews.com/article/trump-xi-trade-tiktok-tariffs-semiconductors-7934c7772af030ba246ba200adf7bf8b) and agreed to [pull back on high tariffs](https://apnews.com/article/trump-xi-china-trade-war-4c19a752c97828246c08f60f0dc54c79) and stepped up rare earth restrictions.

But China’s limits remain tighter than they were before Trump took office.

“We don’t want to ever go through what we went through a year ago,” Trump said on Monday when announcing Project Vault.

Other countries might join with the Trump administration in buying up critical minerals and taking other steps to spur industry development because the trade war revealed how vulnerable Western counties are to China, said Pini Althaus, who founded [Oklahoma rare earth miner USA Rare Earth](https://apnews.com/article/usa-rare-earth-trump-commerce-4c012d70ad172f12d9e3aca24508e766) in 2019.

“They’re looking at setting up sort of a buyers’ club, if you will,” said Althaus, who now is working to develop new mines in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan as CEO of Cove Capital. “The key producers and key consumers of critical minerals will sort of get together and work on pricing structures, floor pricing and other things.”

The government last week also made its fourth direct investment in an American critical minerals producer when it extended $1.6 billion to USA Rare Earth in exchange for stock and a repayment agreement.

Seeking government funding these days is like meeting with private equity investors because officials are scrutinizing companies to ensure anyone they invest in can deliver, Althaus said. And the government is demanding terms designed to generate a return for taxpayers as loans are repaid and stock prices increase, he said.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Export-Import Bank's board this week approved the $10 billion loan — the largest in its history — to help finance the setup of the U.S. Strategic Critical Minerals Reserve. It is tasked with ensuring access to critical minerals and related products for manufacturers, including battery maker Clarios, energy equipment manufacturer GE Vernova, digital storage company Western Digital and aerospace giant Boeing, according to the policy bank.

Bank President and Chairman John Jovanovic told CNBC that the project creates a public-private partnership formula that “is uniquely suited and puts America's best foot forward.”

""What it does is it creates a scenario where there are no free riders. Everybody pitches in to solve this huge problem,” he said.

Manufacturers, which benefit the most from the reserve, are making a long-term financial commitment, Jovanovic said, while the government loan spurs private investments.

The stockpile strategy may help spark a “more organic” pricing model that excludes China, which has used its dominance to flood the market with lower-priced products to squeeze out competitors, said Wade Senti, president of the U.S. permanent magnet company AML.

The Trump administration also has injected public money directly into the sector. The Pentagon has [shelled out](https://apnews.com/article/rare-earths-critical-minerals-trump-china-tariffs-edf8ff79ec97d7245f64afa9f9ac713a) nearly $5 billion over the past year to help ensure its access to the materials after the trade war laid bare just how beholden the U.S. is to China.

A bipartisan group of lawmakers last month proposed creating a new agency with $2.5 billion to spur production of rare earths and the other [critical minerals](https://apnews.com/article/rare-earths-trump-tariffs-china-trade-war-effd6a7ec64b5830df9d3c76ab9b607a). The lawmakers applauded the steps by the Trump administration.

“It’s a clear sign that there is bipartisan support for securing a robust domestic supply of critical minerals that both reduces our reliance on China and stabilizes the market,” Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Todd Young, R-Ind., said in a joint statement Tuesday.

Building up a stockpile will help American companies weather future rare earth supply disruptions, but that will likely be a long-term effort because the materials are still scarce right now with China's restrictions, said David Abraham, a rare earths expert who has followed the industry for decades and wrote the book “The Elements of Power.”

The Trump administration has focused on reinvigorating critical minerals production, but Abraham said it's also important to encourage development of manufacturing that will use them. He noted that Trump’s decisions to [cut incentives for electric vehicles](https://apnews.com/article/climate-trump-electric-vehicles-pollution-standards-ae3a35faa376630e494765175aee2c28) and wind turbines have undercut demand for these elements in America.

**Summary**

* **50-plus countries from Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin America expected at meeting**
* **China's chokehold on critical minerals allows it to control supply chains**
* **US and partners weighing measures to boost minerals production**

WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The United States will host more than 50 countries on Wednesday for talks aimed at boosting their access to critical minerals, in a bid to loosen China's grip over vital industrial inputs that has allowed it to control global supply chains.

The gathering comes after President Donald Trump on Monday launched a strategic stockpile of critical minerals, called [Project Vault](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-launches-12-billion-minerals-stockpile-counter-china-bloomberg-news-2026-02-02/), backed by $10 billion in seed funding from the U.S. Export-Import Bank and $2 billion in private funding.

China has [wielded its chokehold](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-bans-exports-gallium-germanium-antimony-us-2024-12-03/) on the processing of many minerals as geo-economic leverage, at times curbing exports and suppressing prices and undercutting other countries' ability to diversify sources of the materials used to make semiconductors, electric vehicles and advanced weapons.

South Korea, India, Thailand, Japan, Germany, Australia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo are among countries attending the Washington meeting, though the U.S. has not released a full list.

Beijing's expanded export controls on rare earths last year caused [production delays and shutdowns](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/some-european-auto-supplier-plants-shut-down-after-chinas-rare-earth-curbs-2025-06-04/) for auto manufacturers in Europe and the U.S., and a China-generated [glut of lithium](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/albemarle-ceo-says-math-doesnt-work-us-lithium-refinery-project-2025-05-01/) has stalled plans to expand production in the U.S.

Such dependencies have unnerved Washington and its partners, which nonetheless have struggled for years to implement policies to stand up durable domestic mining and processing alternatives for lithium, nickel, rare earths and other critical minerals.

China's leverage was on full display in October when Trump [agreed to trim tariffs](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/looming-trump-xi-meeting-revives-hope-us-china-trade-truce-2025-10-29/) on the country in exchange for Beijing's pledge to hold off on stricter restrictions on rare earths exports.

The talks underscore a broader U.S. push to work with partners to counter China's dominance over critical minerals by coordinating policy tools at a time when Trump has angered allies with his sweeping ""America First"" tariff policies.

Washington and its partners are weighing measures that include aligning trade and investment incentives, encouraging new mining and processing capacity outside China, and exploring market interventions such as price floors, strategic stockpiles and export restrictions to reduce Beijing's leverage over supply chains vital to advanced manufacturing and national security.

""I think this is a recognition by the United States that it must act in concert with others to reduce its vulnerability in areas where China has supply dominance,"" said Scott Kennedy, who leads the Chinese business and economics program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

# INCENTIVES

U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said on Tuesday that 11 more countries would be named to a critical minerals [trade club](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/some-30-countries-want-join-critical-minerals-club-us-interior-secretary-burgum-2026-02-03/) this week, joining the U.S., Australia, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Thailand. He said 20 more countries showed ""strong interest"" in joining the coalition.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance will deliver remarks at the meeting of ministers from across Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America, which according to the State Department, aims to ""advance collective efforts to strengthen and diversify critical minerals supply chains.""

""China has long played an important and constructive role in keeping the global industrial and supply chains of critical minerals safe and stable and is willing to continue to make active efforts in this regard,"" China's embassy in Washington told Reuters when asked about the meeting.

Industry experts say countries must find the right balance of incentives to boost investment in critical minerals production.

Those could include deploying newly created Section 232 tariffs in coordination with allies to establish industry-wide price floors for specific materials.

The Trump administration last year struck a price-floor agreement with rare earths producer MP Materials, but Reuters has reported the administration may now be [moving away](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-moves-away-critical-mineral-price-floors-sources-say-2026-01-28/) from company-specific deals in favor of a broader, international approach.

Washington's Group of Seven partners and the European Union have [considered price floors, opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-hosts-countries-talks-weaken-chinas-grip-critical-minerals-2026-02-04/nMT1ALTL6N3VA0GS1) to promote rare earth production, as well as taxes on some Chinese exports to incentivize investment.

Australia, which has been positioning itself as a critical minerals alternative to China, has also said it would establish a strategic reserve of minerals, expected to be ready by the second half of 2026.

Canberra is also considering [setting a price floor](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-says-us-price-floor-backdown-wont-derail-its-critical-minerals-2026-01-30/) to support local critical minerals projects.

""The reality is that none of us have tested these tools in this context. So, we're looking to see which will be most effective. Most likely it will be a bit of a menu of tools ... I don't think there's going to be a one silver bullet,"" one meeting participant told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

# Feb. 3rd, 2026~EU to offer US critical minerals partnership to check China

[EU to offer US critical minerals partnership to check China - MINING.COM](https://www.mining.com/web/eu-to-offer-us-critical-minerals-partnership-to-check-china/)

[Gardar province, Greenland. Credit: Wikipedia](https://preview.redd.it/ul4czhaujghg1.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbaefa9399c6be1ff00a5c9ca7574bd9bb458af7)

The European Union will pitch the US on a critical minerals partnership to curb China’s influence, looking to shape the Trump administration’s push to strike global agreements this week.

The EU is prepared to sign a memorandum of understanding with the US to develop a “Strategic Partnership Roadmap” within three months, according to people familiar with the matter.

The partnership aims to jointly find ways to source critical minerals, which are needed for most modern technologies, without relying on China. Both the US and EU have become tethered to abundant, cheap Chinese minerals, giving Beijing leverage over their supply chains.

The proposal offers several ways to reduce this dependence, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.

Both sides are aiming to conclude the negotiations within the next 30 days, according to a separate draft statement that the US and the European Commission, the EU executive’s arm, are expected to release on Wednesday and seen by *Bloomberg News*.

The memorandum suggests the EU and US explore joint critical mineral projects and price-support mechanisms. It also recommends ways to shield both markets from an oversupply of outside minerals and other forms of market manipulation. Meanwhile, the proposal says the two sides should build secure supply chains between each other.

Notably, the EU proposal also insists both sides respect each other’s territorial integrity, the people added. The US-EU relationship nearly ruptured in recent weeks after President Donald Trump signaled plans to buy Greenland, a territory of EU-member Denmark.

The EU proposal comes as the US is preparing to convene dozens of foreign ministers and senior officials from allied countries on Wednesday to pursue agreements to cut reliance on Chinese critical minerals.

According to a draft statement, the EU, the US and other partners intend to explore a plurilateral trade initiative with like-minded nations on trade in critical minerals.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the draft statement on Tuesday.

“Such a plurilateral trade initiative could include exploring the development of coordinated trade policies and mechanisms, such as border-adjusted price floors, standards-based markets, price gap subsidies, or offtake agreements,” the draft statement said. The draft statement could still change before its scheduled release on Wednesday.

Numerous US administrations have made similar pushes on critical minerals over the years, trying out several different strategies with little success.

The commission called the talks “vital to diversify our supplies away from any single country,” without commenting on the bloc’s proposal or the draft statement.

The issue is a top priority for Washington after Beijing [imposed export restrictions last year](https://www.mining.com/web/china-pauses-rare-earths-exports-curbs-targeting-us-entities/) on so-called rare earths. The constraints were delayed in October as part of a deal between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, but American officials are now determined to make quick progress on the matter.

In particular, the US is pushing countries to agree on a pricing mechanism to help insulate rare-earth mineral refiners and extractors from cheaper Chinese exports that could undercut supplies mined and refined in the west.

As part of this push, the US pressed some EU member states to sign bilateral deals. In response, the commission asked the bloc’s countries to stick together, and EU capitals gave the commission a mandate to negotiate an agreement.

Officials have expressed skepticism, however, that a substantive deal could be finalized quickly enough.

Still, the EU’s offer shows the talks remain on track. And it reveals the two sides may find common ground.

For instance, the people said the EU’s memorandum notes the possibility of stockpiling critical minerals, which is also a Trump focus. The US president on Monday launched [a $12 billion critical mineral stockpile](https://www.mining.com/trump-plans-12b-minerals-vault-to-cut-china-reliance/) to help protect manufacturers from sudden supply shortages.

The key pillars of the proposal the EU has drafted and is prepared to sign, according to the people, are:

* Cooperating to secure supply chains and cut dependencies, including by developing premium markets internationally and working together to withstand any disruptions;
* Deepening industrial and economic integration, including through joint projects;
* Exempting each other from export restrictions pertaining to critical raw minerals;
* Collaborating on research and innovation along the entire value chain;
* Exchanging information, including on supply chains and identifying risks, as well as working together to bring more transparency to the market. Measures to prevent disruptions could include stockpiling or the creation of a EU-US response group;
* Cooperation on export restrictions applied to third countries.

In today’s battlespace, seconds matter, particularly as operations increasingly rely on multiple platforms and forces acting in unison.

Precision intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) are no longer sequential activities, but integrated functions executed in parallel, where split-second decisions depend on trusted data moving instantly and reliably between platforms.

Lockheed Martin recently advanced this new reality with the inaugural flight demonstration of the Sniper^(®) Networked Targeting Pod (NTP) on two F-16 aircraft. With the support of Aeronautics and 5G.MIL^(®), this event marked a pivotal step in transforming a proven targeting sensor into a battlespace connector.

The flight event validated the real-time flow of targeting data between two upgraded Sniper pods and, simultaneously, onward to a ground station. This capability allows airborne and ground teams to operate from a shared, continuously updated tactical picture, supporting coordinated action effectively shrinking the kill chain to seconds.

**Speed, Shared Awareness and Split-Second Decisions**

As operational complexity increases, decision advantage depends on how quickly and accurately information can be shared across mission partners. Sniper NTP enables the rapid exchange of reliable targeting data that supports situational awareness, increased precision and simultaneous execution across platforms.

The key to this capability is the pod’s ability to network through mobile ad hoc network (MANET) radios and secure datalinks, allowing platforms to exchange sensor information directly and automatically re-establish connectivity if links are interrupted. By networking targeting data across platforms and domains, Sniper NTP allows pilots, ground and maritime teams to work in concert, acting on information in real time. This integrated approach reduces latency, enhances target tracking and supports informed decision making.

**The Networked Evolution of a Proven Sensor**

Building on the combat-proven Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod, Sniper NTP evolves the world's most widely used and trusted electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) targeting sensor into a networked node. By combining reliable sensing with secure, high-speed connectivity, the pod supports coordinated operations across domains while enabling platforms to share trusted data without requiring changes to the aircraft.

This first flight demonstration represents a foundational step toward the future of networked targeting, where precision, speed and connectivity converge to meet the demands of emerging threats.

# IMHO: This Isn’t Hype Anymore — NioCorp, Lockheed, DoD, EXIM & Project Vault Are Converging

Lockheed Martin quietly dropped something major: the first real multi-aircraft networking demo of the **Sniper Networked Targeting Pod (NTP)** — turning a targeting pod into a **real-time battlespace connector**, sharing data between F-16s and ground stations in near-real time. This isn’t just another sensor upgrade… it’s a shift toward **distributed, networked warfare**, where pods become **edge-computing nodes** and kill chains compress from minutes to seconds. And if you’ve been tracking the materials supply chain behind Lockheed’s targeting systems, the pattern forming here is getting impossible to ignore.

Because here’s the part most people miss: **IBC was already in this world a decade ago.** Back in 2015, IBC was supplying precision alloy components tied to Lockheed’s sensor and pod ecosystem — the same ecosystem that Sniper NTP is now upgrading into a next-generation networking architecture. **That matters because Sniper NTP isn’t just software — it’s hardware, thermal stability, stiffness, weight reduction, survivability, manufacturability… all the stuff that lives downstream of advanced alloys and specialty metals!!**

Now fast-forward to **Oct 23, 2025** — and the Pentagon basically confirms what serious investors already suspected: NioCorp and Lockheed Skunk Works are working together on a **scandium-based defense technology**, funded via **Title III of the Defense Production Act**. That’s not a casual “research partnership.” That’s the U.S. government saying: **we are funding the domestic scandium mine-to-master-alloy supply chain** because it matters to warfighter capability. Mark Smith even spelled out the core point: when NioCorp comes online producing \~100 tonnes/year scandium oxide, the U.S. goes from foreign dependence to domestic control — and that becomes a defense and commercial game changer.

[For 30 years, every aerospace, EV, and defense prime has said the same two things about scandium: “We can’t design Sc-Al alloys without a reliable U.S. supply,” and “We can’t build supply without committed alloy demand.” That deadlock froze the entire U.S. scandium industry — until now. NioCorp didn’t just talk it to death, it broke the loop by moving downstream into Sc-Al alloys, FEA-IP Revolutionary production methods, and real platforms meant to make actual stuff. And this is where Ecclestone’s take collapses under its own weight: hand-waving about “no market” while ignoring that markets don’t exist until someone builds the ecosystem is intellectual laziness, not analysis. NioCorp isn’t waiting for permission — it’s doing the one thing critics never model: committing capital, partners, and engineering to force demand into existence. That’s not hype — that’s how industries are born. Like TITANIUM in the 1950's!](https://reddit.com/link/1qvlu4n/video/jf12qcuvmghg1/player)

Now we hit the current fuse: **February 2026.** Mark has already telegraphed that a **ScAl alloy platform/component reveal** is coming this month involving Lockheed, DoD, NAMA, and the industrial stack. And that’s where the Sniper NTP timing gets *very* interesting. Lockheed just demonstrated a major upgrade to its targeting pod architecture — and simultaneously, the Pentagon-funded scandium alloy program with NioCorp is approaching a reveal window. That’s not proof the Sniper pod itself is the scandium target… but it *is* strong evidence that Lockheed is moving in a coordinated way: **systems modernization + advanced materials + domestic supply chain hardening**, all at the same time.

Meanwhile, NioCorp isn’t just sitting around waiting for “someday.” They’ve begun ramp initiation — **equipment mobilization is on site now**, dual-ramp progression is underway, and the project is moving like a company that already knows the next step is financing, not exploration. And the next major milestone is the **March DFS**, which is specifically designed for financiers and offtakers — meaning this is where the story stops being “we have a deposit” and becomes “here is the bankable, engineered, finance-ready industrial system.” That DFS is the bridge between speculation and contract.

[DUAL RAMP DIG EQUIPMENT IS ON SITE : https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/NIOCORP\_MINE\/comments\/1quq4jj\/niocorp\_5\_pics\_from\_2226\_at\_the\_mine\_site\_cridet\/](https://preview.redd.it/a5lf3yt4pghg1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=37aaef75bf1dc7d2a81b74465d30d25e7f5f1aad)

**Now add the nuclear-grade macro catalyst:** **Project Vault.** Trump’s $12B critical minerals stockpile initiative isn’t symbolic — it’s a bankability weapon. A federal-aligned buyer of last resort, paired with EXIM lending power, is exactly the kind of structure that can take a long-life, multi-mineral U.S. asset like Elk Creek from “great on paper” to “financeable at scale.” Project Vault isn’t about spot prices — it’s about locking in domestic supply so the U.S. doesn’t get strangled by China in a crisis. And guess what Elk Creek is? A DFARS-aligned, fully domestic source of **niobium, scandium, titanium, and REEs** — the exact kind of “strategic infrastructure” Vault was made for.

And today — **Feb 4, 2026** — the U.S. is hosting the inaugural **Critical Minerals Ministerial** with delegations from 50+ nations in Washington. That’s not random. That’s the diplomatic layer being built around the financing and industrial layer. These are the rooms where supply chains are carved up: offtake frameworks, allied processing agreements, strategic stockpile pathways, and cross-border industrial coordination. And Mark Smith has been unambiguous: **“2026 is the year.”** Not as hype — as a sequencing statement. February ScAl validation. March DFS. Mid-2026 EXIM FID. Then construction and ramp to production by 2029.

**So when people ask “what’s going on with all these catalysts?” — IMHO\~here’s the answer: everything is converging at once.** Lockheed modernizing systems. Pentagon funding ScAl development. NioCorp mobilizing execution. DFS imminent. EXIM in the room. Project Vault announced. Ministerial happening today. And NioCorp’s team already in D.C. where the financing and allocation conversations are happening. The market is still treating NioCorp like a junior miner — but the U.S. government is now treating critical minerals like oil in the 1970s.

https://reddit.com/link/1qvlu4n/video/9vo1iqiknghg1/player

**Mark Smith has been unambiguous —** **“2026 is the year.”** Not a hope, not a slogan, but a sequencing statement backed by actions already underway: ramp initiation, Washington D.C. meetings with EXIM, the February ScAl alloy validation with Lockheed and the DoD, the March DFS designed for financiers and offtakers, and a mid-2026 EXIM FID. Smith has repeatedly emphasized that Elk Creek isn’t being built for headlines or subsidies, but to deliver fully domestic, DFARS-compliant critical minerals at scale — and that timeline converges in 2026. And now with **Project Vault officially launched**, the U.S. hosting a **50+ nation Critical Minerals Ministerial**, and Lockheed simultaneously pushing next-gen systems like Sniper NTP, the backdrop has shifted from “interesting” to **strategic urgency**. This is the year execution replaces speculation, when discussions turn contractual, and when NioCorp transitions from “future supply” to strategic reality-

**NioCorp isn’t waiting for policy anymore… policy is being written around NioCorp — and they’re already near the rooms where it’s all happening.** 💥

fyi Palantir is the company helping out ICE in the USA, just so you know what you're avoiding.

THE OLIVE GOODNESS: 🫒🫒🫒  
They have the fancy chilled deli type stuff - there's a whole cornucopia of green olives, mixed olives, some kinda combo fandango with fetta, sundried tomatoes - there's a lot going on, but not a huge amount, so if that's your thang, get on it. There's also jars of always fresh kalamata olives which could be a good pantry staple - whack in the fridge after you open. I'm fond of a black hummus with kalamata olives, beluga lentils, black tahini, lemon juice - it's a nice change from beigeville with hummus.

On your way out - have a gander at the shelf behind those lovely staff ringing up your order. If you're lucky, you'll see very fancy tall bottles of greenish yellow extra virgin olive oil.  
$10 each, super luxe, would make an excellent housewarming/thanks for having us/foodie gift, or just celebrate your fine self and get both like I did. Salads, marinades, airfried roast potatoes have never been more delicious.  
There's two types.

1. truffle
2. lemon myrtle + pepper flavoured.

Behind the counter, there's also truffle dust. I'm so intrigued, but have no idea what I'd do with it, considering I still have a massive jar of truffle pate from 2025 to get through - but if you haven't truffled before, you could do much worse. Get some barilla pasta, some grated parmesan/parmigano/whatever you fancy in the chiller section, and sprinkle some of the truffle dust/truffle olive oil over.  
My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

Hummus: large amounts. The tubs of tahini hummus I've had before, and it's great - creamy, whipped (which is cheating a little because they're charging you for air, but I'm cool with light and fluffy). There's also bulk things in bags. Having a party? Take it home, whack it in a fancy bowl, garnish, no one will be the wiser.

[They sell this stuff at woolies for $95 a kilo.](https://www.woolworths.com.au/shop/productdetails/104173/fromager-d-affinois-double-cream-cheese)  
The Daff is still there, but it's not the wheels, but the cute lil' boxes that you could buy in bulk, throw them in the freezer as they are, and drag 'em out the morning of the afternoon that you're gonna go crazy with the cheeseboard to end all cheeseboards with your creamy crack, the olives, and whatever else floats yr boat.

They have the cute lil' boxes for around $2 - they come in red and blue, if you eat cheese, do not leave without them. I worded up someone last week - OMG if you haven't had this, you gotta try it - and they walked out with 4. Happy to make you happy.  
The gorgonzola is still there too if you're into The Stinkies.

Do let us know what you get, and give it a rating out of 5 stars, or the number of ambulances required to carry you away after digesting a kilo or so of the Creamy Crack.

EGGS: yes, they're selling eggs, free range.

FROZENS:  
Sweet potato fries from birdseye - I think they're still there? If so, score. I'd imagine they're like the ones from The Good Lord aka Lord Of The Fries, only a half the price for about triple the amount that you'd get from Lord.  
cauliflower rice and or the cauliflower/brocc combo,  
steamfresh frozen cubed carrot with peas and corn. combine the two in an airfryer in ratios that float yr boat, then add sesame oil, soy sauce + chili crisp for a decent serve of veg.

There's a new thing of vegan samosas - bought + tried, and it's more pulses (lentils? chickpeas?) than veg, but I'm cool with that. Heavily spiced, but in a good way. A trek to your freezer/airfryer if you can't be bothered trekking to Flora opposite flinders st station for a dosa.

Massive amounts of mini potato cakes/scallops/whatever you call them.  
Tempura veg - comes in boxes with pumpkin, potato, maybe sweet potato and something else? I forget, but it's fun to grab a box, airfry as a snack, or combine with something else (samosa?) for a meal.  
Fish: battered, salmon, heck knows what, but it's worth a look.  
The frozen Nissin pork flavoured noodles are back! Small amounts, get in quick smart if that's your thing.

PIZZA: DR Oetker - I think choice magazine did a taste test of frozen pizzas, and this brand came out on top. There's a salami version with a more puffed/foccacia like base than the usual crispy crust.

MEAT: There's much. There's fresh dog food in the chiller - I think it was beef'n'beetroot? Something weird, but if you have a voracious hound, you're in luck.  
So much bacon. If you're a bacon and egg fiend, lap of luxury and cholesterol, my friend :)  
There's also 2kg bags of sliced salami. Massive...sausages? sausage shaped things? I'm vegetarian, so I just sort of clock what it is without looking too closely.  
There's ham hocks/things. If cheese'n'ham is your idea of flavourtown, now is your Time To Shine, because there is much of both.  
There's large amounts of frozen duck if duck pancakes are your idea of a Good Time.

They have a stack of single serve icecreams, along with tubs of various sweet things that kill you slowly (a tradie put me onto Yuka - it's a app that tells you the shitty things in your food, and that's why he makes his own icecream - because everything has weird shit ™ in it).

I am hesitant to talk about this, because it could be gone before you get there - but I spied custard tarts - the kind you get at fancy cafes - in the freezer section of Footscray on monday, along with aforementioned last month and previously loved by a customer: the custard waffles, also found in the freezer section. It's a gamble. Go play in the freezer section and see what you can score in the Grand Casino of life.

LIBATIONS:  
capi grapefruit: it's gone from flemington 😭  
The raspberry flavoured Sodaly = 3 litres for $5 ✅🤗  
Flemington have their window crammed with canned coffee drinks, if that's yr thang. There's also Illy Instant for a song - $4? I'm no coffee snob, so I love stuff like that for a change in flavour, also handy for making iced coffee, flavouring cakes/baked goods/substantial pasta sauce/whatever.

Lime cordial - comes in a fancy glass bottle, 40% lime juice. You could use it as a marinade with the appropriate additions of soy sauce, ginger, garlic, chilli etc, as the sweet is already there. Tofu etc never got so lucky or delicious after in bath in that + airfry (for the unitiated, cube/slice/tear to get good surface area before marinading/frying - I wouldn't do a whole block...)

If there's something in particular that you've tried and loved that's in stock, tell us about it.

PASTA: No lack of pasta sauce. (this is a repeat of previous - nothing new here ⬇️)  
Rana: It's half price compared to supermarkets (I think it was IGA that I checked...) so feel free to splurge. Buyer beware that Rana is notorious for being Not Quite Right - it's not the fault of CBM, but of the food chain - because it's pasta, warehousing folk before CBM might leave it out, assuming it's dry pasta. Nope. It needs to be housed in a chiller. Do carefully check packs before you buy, and get a receipt. Anything dodgy gets a refund, and CBM have always been great for refunds on the rare occasions that I've needed them.

Barilla is in, so get your fine self a box or 3 of that. For the gluten free fiends, they have that, and I tried it, it was only $1 a box, and...I won't be buying it again. Even if my gut hates gluten, my tastebuds hate gluten free pasta that is just gluggy and wrong, and it can be done right, just not that stuff. Don't take my word for it, feel free to give it a go, worst case scenario it's a great addition to the compost heap.

WARNING/AVOID:  
PSA: do check use by - as in, yep, you really should be eating it before that date, and you can risk a few days after (I have coconut yoghurt that's still fine a few days after use by). Be particularly careful with anything in the chiller/freezer - sometimes, there's stuff with todays date on it, and you don't realise until you get it home. Do your due diligence, or have a bevy of starving flatmates - your choice.

LARGE JARS OF GREEN OLIVES = NOPE. Do not get these. Olives should be able to be pitted by slamming a knife on them - like you do with crushing garlic. Those ones don't. Mine also had ones that were rotting with black marks inside. Those massive jars also need to be chilled after opening. Are. You. Kidding. Me. Not worth it, IMHO.

EVENT:  
There's a super cool barber shop (1 street behind CBM?) in footscray that is going to have a wall turned into a gallery complete with opening sponsored by CBM. This is your opportunity to support art, community and with any luck, a metric fuckton of cheese consumption.  
Toni Gedjo, at 164 Barkly St. Opening happening on Friday 6th Feb 6-9pm.

1qvlqhu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qvlqhu,I built a quiz that guesses when your globe/map was made based on geopolitical questions,"Hey everyone!

I've been working on a side project called Date My Globe ([https://datemyglobe.online](https://datemyglobe.online)) - an interactive quiz that helps you figure out when a globe or historical map was produced.

**HOW IT WORKS**

The app asks you yes/no questions about what's shown on your globe:

\- Is Germany shown as divided (East/West)?

\- Does the USSR exist on your globe?

\- Is Zimbabwe shown as Rhodesia?

Based on your answers, it uses a binary search algorithm to narrow down the date range until it can pinpoint when your globe was likely made. Usually takes about 8-15 questions to get a precise result.

**WHY I BUILT THIS**

I've always been fascinated by old globes and maps at flea markets, antique shops, or my grandparents' house. The question ""when was this made?"" is surprisingly hard to answer without knowing specific geopolitical events. This tool automates that detective work.

**FEATURES**

\- 150+ historical facts covering major geopolitical changes (1800-present)

\- Supports 8 languages (EN, PL, DE, ES, FR, IT, HI, ZH)

\- Works on mobile and desktop

\- No account required, completely free

\- Privacy-friendly (no tracking beyond basic analytics)

**EARLY DEVELOPMENT NOTICE**

This is still in early testing phase! There will likely be bugs, missing facts, or incorrect dates. Some things I'm aware of:

\- Some translations may be incomplete or awkward

\- The algorithm might ask redundant questions occasionally

\- Not all historical border changes are covered yet

**I'D LOVE YOUR FEEDBACK!**

\- Did it correctly date your globe/map?

\- Any historical facts that should be added?

\- Bugs or weird behavior?

\- UI/UX improvements?

Feel free to comment here or reach out. I'm actively developing this and every piece of feedback helps!

\---

**TL;DR:** Free web app that asks you questions about your globe/map and tells you when it was made. Still in beta, looking for testers and feedback. Yes, background color was made by AI.

I love how your hair dances to the beat of the cold breeze; how your smile seems to illuminate even the darkest of depths; how we danced till our knees gave out. Even after many winters that your hair has turned to snow, how both our teeth may not fill our smiles, or how our knees can’t even support us properly when walking. I still love the same things about you.



It is a new day today, the sun kissing my face, the aroma of the hot cup of coffee in my hands, the sounds of children playing outside and the sounds of the hand of the towering grandfather clock in our living room.



How fast the time flies, Spring has already arrived, but I’d still prefer the cold breeze of winter if I still have your warmth.

I’m a pre-seed stage fintech startup founder traveling and working remotely and will be in Vienna soon. 

I have a weekend trip planned, but I’m thinking of coming in a bit earlier on feb 12/13 (Thursday + Friday). I was planning on working out of a coffee shop those days but wanted to shoot my shot in here to see if anyone is open to my working out of their office space (craving some founder interaction ya know?)

For a bit of context: Im running a fintech company out of Atlanta and am a Techstars SF alum. I interacted a bit with the Vienna startup up scene back when I was doing an exchange semester at WU a few years ago. Sadly didn’t keep in touch with most of the Vienna folks I met, so trying my luck here.

Would love to borrow a desk, Wi-Fi, and good startup energy. Happy to buy coffee, swap founder stories, jam on ideas, or quietly get work done and stay out of the way.

If you’re a founder or part of a small team and wouldn’t mind a temporary desk-mate for a day or two, I’d love to connect. Comment or DM works!",4,1770203226.0,Startups_EU,0,0.84,False

Chapter 1 

Chapter 1 

Three years. Three years I watched my husband pack his bags and fly his entire family-mom, dad, siblings, the whole damn circus-to Australia 

for New Year’s. 

Me? I got the same line every single time. 

“Flights are expensive, Genevieve. Someone’s gotta stay and watch the house.” 

So I did. Like an idiot. For three years straight. 

But this year? This year, I didn’t argue. Didn’t cry. Didn’t even blink. 

I just smiled real sweet, waved them off at the door, and waited. 

The second their car turned the corner, I was on the phone with my realtor. 

“List it. Today.” 

Two weeks later, my darling husband came home from his little family vacay, dragging his suitcase up the driveway like he owned the place. 

Spoiler alert: he didn’t. 

He froze at the front door. 

New locks. Two massive dudes sitting on my couch, feet up, looking real comfortable. 

Then came the calls. The texts. The voicemails. Frantic. 

I let him sweat for a minute. Then I sent one text back: 

“House? SOLD. Marriage? OVER. You and your precious family can figure out where to crash together. Good luck with that!” 

Ronan Prescott stood the last suitcase up by the front door. 

“Genevieve,” he said, “it’s the same deal as last year.” 

I stopped wiping the coffee table. 

And just stared at him. 

I looked at his mom, Sharon, and his dad, Robert, hovering behind him. 

I looked at his sister, Tiffany, and her husband, Kevin. 

And their kid, Gabriel, clutching his parents’ hands. 

The whole squad. All six of them. 

They were heading to Australia. 

For the third year in a row.

For the New Year’s break. 

“Flights are insane right now, and honestly, you’d just be bored anyway,” Ronan said, the words falling off his tongue like a practiced script. 

“Besides, someone’s gotta watch the place,” Sharon chimed in, not even bothering to look at me while she dug through her purse. 

“Yeah, Genevieve, we’ll be back before you know it!” Tiffany added with that fake-ass innocent smile. 

Same lines for three years. 

Not a single word changed. 

Year one, I cried my eyes out. 

Year two, I screamed my head off. 

But this year? 

I just smiled. 

“Fine,” I said. 

One word. That’s it. 

Ronan blinked, totally caught off guard by how chill I was being. 

He’d probably spent all morning rehearsing his excuses. 

Ready to shut down my questions, my tears, and my “hysterical” outbursts. 

Now, he had nothing to fight against. 

A flicker of awkwardness crossed his face. 

“Well… okay then. Take care of things here. Call if you need anything.” 

“Mhm.” 

“You need some cash?” 

“I’m good.” 

“Alright. We’re heading out.” 

He grabbed the handle of his suitcase. 

The whole clan swarmed out the door. 

The front door slammed shut with a heavy thud. 

The world finally went quiet. 

Sharon’s cheap perfume was still lingering in the air. 

A few half-finished glasses of water were still sweating on the table.

Chapter 1 

I stood there, taking it all in. 

For a long, long time. 

Then, I pulled out my phone. 

And found a contact I’d saved a week ago. 

“Sal, it’s Genevieve. You ready?” 

The background noise on his end was loud. 

“Genevieve! Hey! You finally making the move?” 

“I’m in,” I said. 

“The house. List it. Now.” 

“You got it! I’ll bring some buyers over ASAP. I’m gonna get you a killer price, I promise!” 

“Don’t bother with the top price.” 

I walked to the window and watched the airport shuttle pull away from the curb. 

“Sal, I want this done fast. Like, yesterday fast.” 

“List it ten percent below market value for an all-cash deal.” 

The line went dead silent for a second. 

“Whoa, you sure? That’s a massive chunk of change you’re leaving on the table.” 

“I’m positive.” 

“Sell it. Now.” 

I hung up. 

Tossed the phone onto the cushions. 

And walked into the bedroom. 

I opened the closet and pulled out my own suitcase. 

The same red one I’d rolled in here with three years ago. 

Now, it was leaving with me. 

I’m done with this house, 

And I’m damn sure done with this “husband.” 

They love doing everything together as a family? 

Fine. I’ll give them exactly what they want.

Chapter 1 

I folded my clothes, one by one, and packed them away. 

I took my time. 

It felt like a ritual. 

A final goodbye to three years of being a doormat. 

I didn’t have much. 

Everything I cared about fit into one bag. 

Finally, I reached into the back of the nightstand and pulled out a leather folder. 

The deed to the house. 

Only my name was on it. 

The one bit of leverage my parents made sure I had. 

I tucked it into my jacket pocket. 

Zipped the suitcase shut. 

I stood up and took one last look around. 

I chose those curtains. I picked those sheets. 

Our wedding photo was still staring back at me from the wall. 

Ronan looked so “tender” in that shot. 

And I looked so “happy.” 

What a joke! 

I walked over, ripped the frame off the wall. 

And slammed it onto the floor. 

The glass shattered into a million pieces. 

That was the most satisfying sound I’d heard in this house in three years! 

I grabbed my bag and walked out. 

I didn’t look back. 

My phone buzzed. 

It was Sal. 

“Genevieve, I’m downstairs. I’ve got two serious buyers with me. Both all-cash, ready to close.”

Just released **Kinded v0.5.0**, a derive macro that generates data-free ""kind"" enums from your enums.

  
Release notes: [https://github.com/greyblake/kinded/releases/tag/v0.5.0](https://github.com/greyblake/kinded/releases/tag/v0.5.0)

**Example:**

      use kinded::Kinded;
    
      // Derive implementation of DrinkKind
      #[derive(Kinded)]
      enum Drink {
          Mate,
          Coffee(String),
          Tea { variety: String },
      }
    
      let drink = Drink::Coffee(""Espresso"".into());
      assert_eq!(drink.kind(), DrinkKind::Coffee);

**What's new in v0.5.0**

* `kind()` is now const fn
* `skip_derive` to opt out of default traits
* `attrs` to pass through attributes (e.g., for serde)

**How is it different from strum / enum-kind?**

The key difference is that Kinded provides a [Kinded trait](https://docs.rs/kinded/latest/kinded/trait.Kinded.html), allowing you to build generic abstractions.

I've been struggling with procrastination and time blindness for as long as I can remember. One day, I decided I would try to build a routine that actually sticks. MyFocus.Zone was born as a solution to my problem. It helped me break task paralysis and maintain better focus.

My ritual is as follows:

* start the day, drink 2 coffee cups, scroll socials, and plan the day for 25 minutes. 
* open the app
* get hit with a visual ambience
* put on brain.fm music or background sounds from the app
* start easy to build momentum: 3 x 10 min sessions
* extend to 1 hour sessions

The app itself has a bunch of different mechanisms built in to keep me aware throughout the day: 5 sec checkins, overtime screen, etc. 

Now I'm opening it up to see if it can help other people too.

It's not magic. Just an opinionated way of working.

I was prescribed Pristiq at the end of December last year, around a couple of weeks before I went into break from college.

The very first time I took it (50mg), I had such a quick, intense anxiety reaction to it I thought it had to had some kind of weird interaction with the antibiotic I took that day, or maybe it was the cup of coffee I had that morning that made it worse, but now I think that was just Pristiq doing its thing.

I almost missed an important class that morning because I was convinced something was really wrong. My face was tingly, my hands were sweating, my heart was pounding, and I felt so bad I cried my eyes out and asked my poor boyfriend to come down from school to my house and back because I was scared something bad would happen if I went on my own.

A doctor told me to hold off on Pristiq while I took my antibiotics, in the rare, unlikely chance that my intense reaction had something to do with taking both at the same time. I went on vacation while on the antibiotic, so I decided not to take it on vacation and held off on Pristiq for a couple of weeks.

Once I began taking it again, I didn't have any super strong reactions to it, until I forgot to take it.

I didn't research Pristiq much before getting on it and I'm not sure but I don't think I'd ever taken an SNRI before, so my experiences with forgetting to take my medication or even to just flat out not want take it for a day for whatever reason were pretty unremarkable.

I usually take my birth control in the morning, so taking Pristiq at the same time helped me not to forget to take it. But since I was on a break from BC, and wasn't waking up early for class, I forgot to take Pristiq for a couple of days.

The day I remembered to take it again, I had a cup of coffee and went to the gym and felt woozy once I began exercising, like my blood pressure had dropped. I had to keep sighing and taking deep breaths the whole time I was there. I tried to keep the exercises light, but in the end I couldn't do much at all. After that my chest hurt a bit for the rest of the night, which is a nightmare for someone who began taking Pristiq partially for health anxiety.

Then, a couple of weeks after that, I had an unusual morning and forgot to take both my medication until the afternoon, and was only home to take it around 9PM. I read that if it wasn't past around 12h after the time you usually take it, that it was best to take Pristiq instead of missing it. That night, about 8h later, I had the worst physical symptoms yet.

I had a bouncy leg and a headache throughout the night after I took it, but I was in a noisy place so I chalked it up to that. Then I woke up in the middle of the night with my heart pounding and had bad diarrhea out of nowhere. I felt once again like my blood pressure had dropped and had that fainty feeling you get when it happens. I was hyperventilating, holding my boyfriend's hand scared I was going to pass out on the toilet. I had to ask my mom for help because I couldn't calm down, let alone go back to sleep at all.

I haven't forgotten to take Pristiq since, God forbid I do. I'm still getting weird symptoms sometimes, but much less so when I'm taking it consistently. It does definitely work when I don't forget about it, but if I do, I'll have the worse anxiety of my life.",1,1770202158.0,Pristiq,0,1.0,False

I’ve recently started a Bookstagram and wanted to share what I’m doing here, because it’s a bit more than just pretty book photos.

I post about:

	•	📚 what I’m reading (reviews, current reads, cosy bookish content)

	•	☕️ coffee & slow moments

	•	🐾 pets (more on that below!)

	•	💛 small acts of kindness in the community

Alongside the Bookstagram, I’m also looking at doing book & coffee kindness parcels - leaving sealed books and coffee sachets in safe public spots for people to take, as a way of spreading a little comfort and raising awareness for MND charity. It’s very much a “no pressure, take if you need it” kind of thing.

✨ Pet Highlight Feature ✨

I’ve also started a pet highlight on my page because let’s be honest - pets + books = elite content.

If you’d like your pet featured, you can submit:

	•	A photo of your pet

	•	Their name

Dogs, cats, chaos goblins - all welcome.

I’m really trying to build a genuine, cosy, supportive bookish space. If you love books, coffee, kindness, or just enjoy seeing other people’s pets on your feed, you’d be very welcome.

If this sounds like your vibe, I’d love to have you 💛

**Two new themes**:  This took way more work than expected. What started as ""eh ill just change some colors"" turned into me redesigning every single component twice.

1. Desk theme - the entire app becomes a physical desk. Quick capture is a sticky note. Active notes are paper cards. The sidebar is a filing cabinet. inbox items are colored sticky notes. The editor uses a handwriting-style font on lined paper. It looks like what your desk would look like if you were an organized person (so, aspirational for me)
2. Terminal theme - everything is remapped to CLI conventions. Even the cursor is a block cursor. 

Both themes carry through to every modal, the editor, lifecycle views. You can switch between them in settings - few more elements will still need the repaint which I will ship as soon as we finish with some of the other core features (More themes coming too!)

**Menu bar tray icon**: Quick capture and daily notes are now accessible from the macOS menu bar. Click the icon, capture a thought, never open the main app. this was a small addition but ive been using it constantly. My shower thoughts now have a 3 second path from brain to inbox. Dangerous.

Seriously though, its super useful and you can summon it from any app with Ctrl + Shift + N too! 

Other stuff that shipped:

  \- Inline image previews in the editor - paste a markdown image and it renders inline

  \- YouTube and iframe embeds for trusted domains

  \- Clickable bare URLs (auto-link detection)

  \- Keyboard shortcuts for headings (Cmd+1-6), lists, and checklists

  \- Per-tab undo history - switch tabs, come back, your undo stack is still there. Revolutionary technology, I know.

  \- Delete buttons on dashboard cards (active notes and inbox)

  \- Vault switcher dropdown with recent vaults

  \- What's New modal so you can see whats changed after updates

  \- A bunch of cursor/selection fixes in the editor that were driving me crazy. Seven commits to fix double-click word selection. Seven...

**Whats in progress:**

Working on a proper task management system - pulling tasks out of notes into their own first-class entities with due dates, priorities, and a dedicated view. Early days but the database schema is laid out. More on this soon.

**Numbers:**

Test coverage went from 168 to 296 tests. Not glamorous but the app is way more stable for it.

Been hesitant to post on bigger subs because I dont want to come across as spammy - so for now this is where the updates live. If you know anyone who'd want to try it, send them over. I'm open to DM, discord, wherever for any feedback :) - oh also, I added a feedback box inside the app too - so if you want to cuss at me anonymously, you can!

I didn't have the urge to drink, but I did have an appointment for red light therapy. Spending $30 bucks on that seemed like a deal compared to the $60-$100+ I'd have normally spent on booze. It was nice...warm, soothing, restful. I didn't come out of the experience changed forever, but I did sleep like rock, until 12:51am.

I had the most vivid dream, that woke me up very uneasy and apprehensive as a result. First, apparently there is an anti-christ child, and cheese is his trigger. My dream self thought that was freaking ridiculous and there was no way in hell I was abstaining from \*cheese\* for the rest of my life. (Note: my dream self did not question why this kid existed in my life at all).

So, dream me ate cheese sticks and only the cheese topping of a pizza for days. For some inexplicable reason, I thought I could hide the evidence under piles of dirt. Meaning...pizza crusts covered in dirt just seemed totally logical to me. Obviously, intelligence was foresaken in the pursuit of delicious cheese rewards. (This tracks in real life too).

Anyway....using dirt to hide my sins didn't work. Somehow this evil kid was triggered by my cheese eating events and \*literally\* let loose the dogs of hell....which we're mostly rat terriers. I woke up in a tense sweat about a second before any of the dog actually got to dream me.

I really didn't get back to sleep after that. I finally just got up at 4am to shower and get ready for the day. I'll have early coffee and ponder the metaphor my subconscious gave me before work today.
