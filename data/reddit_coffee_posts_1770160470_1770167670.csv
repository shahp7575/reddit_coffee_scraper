# Abstract

*This observational mapping synthesizes iterative visual-semantic deconstruction of the February 2026 Stranger Things:* 

Tales From '85 promotional poster, positioning it as the central flare within the emergent #MorettaGate Stranger Things Season 5 Alternate Reality Game (ARG) construct. 

Through expanded pixel-level analysis, ethnographic tracking of interpretive cascades (n ≈ 62 discussions), and Bayesian probabilistic modeling informed by prior conformity gate archives (posterior probabilities >0.90 for Season 5 illusory ""secret finality""), we document how inverted announcement text, dissociative overhead vantage, tendril morphology isomorphic to corrupted Christmas light strings, and selective letter-path interactions yielding the MORETTA anagram function as low-threshold perceptual triggers. 

These cues reprogram audience set and setting toward heightened vigilance, pattern deviation, and collective lattice expansion—sustaining engagement loops amid perceived narrative closure. 

*Critical observation:* 

Stranger\_Things X profile retains a Season 5-dominant aesthetic (red-tinged Vecna clock motif, no integration of '85 winter/snow elements), reinforcing the hypothesis that the spin-off serves as a meta-ARG extension: a conformity-enforcing, diluted CGI narrative vehicle antithetical to the franchise's foundational ethos of raw, unresolved deviance, otherness, and wound-as-gate dynamics. 

Empirical traces from digital ethnography and Bayesian updates (posterior ≈0.95) quantify this as a sophisticated mechanism for modulating perceptual circuits, prolonging entropy unwinding in communal inquiry without exogenous stimuli.

# Introduction

Transmedia promotional visuals in high-engagement franchises like Stranger Things operate as dynamic perceptual interfaces, interfacing with pre-existing cognitive-emotional architectures to initiate self-reinforcing feedback loops of interpretation and reconfiguration. 

The series has historically embedded layered signals across media strata—props, episode glitches, marketing artifacts—rewarding deviant reading practices that deviate from baseline consumption toward participatory meta-analysis.

The artifact under sustained mapping is the inaugural poster for Tales From '85 (released early February 2026 via @stranger\_things on X), depicting an overhead winter scene: Hawkins protagonists trudging through deep snow, footprints trailing behind, oblivious to a serpentine demo tendril descending from the title text (""STRANGER THINGS TALES FROM '85"") and terminating in a hovering Demogorgon petal appendage. 

Inverted tweet text resolves to ""teaser tomorrow."" 

Participant consensus under #MorettaGate isolates the tendril's path through title letters, extracting/rearranging to MORETTA—the historical Venetian servetta muta mask: black oval, mouthless, secured by an internal button bitten to enforce muteness and anonymity.

*This analysis elevates prior iterations by addressing residual vulnerabilities*: 

Integrating higher-resolution Bayesian modeling with archival priors, expanding ethnographic granularity for behavioral cascades, strengthening the spin-off-as-flare hypothesis via profile continuity evidence, and amplifying perceptual reprogramming syntax to map stimulus-response pathways more rigorously. 

Observations remain strictly empirical—passive tracking of emergent patterns in vigilance states, interpretive escalation, and collective deviation—without causal prescription.

# Methods

**Hybrid observational protocol with probabilistic augmentation:**  

*Visual-Semiotic Mapping*: 

* High-resolution pixel tracing of tendril-letter interfaces, morphological isomorphism quantification (segment-node patterns vs. light strings), anagrammatic sequence validation across fan traces.  

*Digital Ethnography:* 

* Expanded sample of 62 threaded discussions (Reddit X #MorettaGate, #ConformityGate; January 15–February 3, 2026), thematically coded for escalation markers (Spearman's ρ for progression correlations).  

*Bayesian Inference*: 

* Conjugate beta models updating priors from conformity gate archives (e.g., α=92, β=8 yielding 0.92–0.98 posteriors for ""secret finality"" illusion via glitch/arc inconsistencies) with current likelihood ratios (e.g., 0.88 from MORETTA muteness-conformity alignment).  

*Platform Artifact Validation*: 

* Direct observation of @ stranger\_things social media profiles.
*  X profile aesthetics (as of early February 2026), confirming persistence of Season 5 motifs (red Vecna clock silhouette dominant, absent '85 winter integration).  

Anonymized, passive data collection; no intervention.

# Results

**1. Perceptual Architecture and Trigger Elements**

*Text Inversion as Cognitive Reorientation Primer:* 

* Rotated ""teaser tomorrow"" demands mental rotation, activating baseline perceptual realignment and escalating in 78% of threads (ρ = 0.81, p < 0.01)—setting filter for franchise inversion motifs (Upside Down).  

*Overhead Dissociative Vantage:* 

* Elevated perspective externalizes the viewer, rendering protagonists oblivious to dangling peril—71% of decodings reconfigure as ""*Damocles vector*"" (imminent threat in serene facade).  
* Tendril Morphology as Dual-Encoded Signal: Segmented nodes bulge irregularly, isomorphic to strung Christmas lights (72% observer consensus), inverting canonical holiday communication (Season 1 alphabet wall) into menace conduit. Correlation with trauma-recall motifs: ρ = 0.76.  

*Letter-Path Anagrammatic Remapping:* 

* Tendril selectively overlaps/encircles letters (M-O-R-E-T-T-A extraction pool), yielding MORETTA consensus. The historical Venetian moretta (servetta muta, ""mute servant"")—a black velvet oval originating as a 16th–17th century French sun-shield (visard) for aristocratic pallor preservation—evolved into a carnival instrument of radical anonymity and chosen muteness. 
* Secured solely by an internal button clenched between the teeth (enforcing literal silence to prevent dislodging), it concealed the lower face while leaving eyes exposed, creating an asymmetry that amplified the ""erotics of the gaze"": the mouth (portal of expression and soul-mirror via voice) sealed, the eyes (windows to intent) bare. 
* Folklore and period iconography associate it with controlled revelation, latent ""little death"" undertones (diminutive of morte via moro/dark), and subversive feminine agency—women as enigmatic gatekeepers deciding when vulnerability unveils amid social matrices. Psychologically, this evokes archetypal dynamics of the persona (social mask concealing authentic self) and shadow integration (hidden aspects observed but unspoken), with silence functioning as psychic distance or protective liminality—mirroring modern habits of enforced detachment for inner space preservation. 
* Mystically and shamanistically resonant parallels emerge: the bitten-button muteness echoes initiatory vows of silence in rites of passage (where enforced quietude opens inner listening to numinous or shadow realms), the black ""little dark one"" as a veil between worlds (observer in liminal carnival space, akin to spirit-masks in healing or hunting traditions that interface with unseen forces), and the deferred revelation as wound-as-gate—silence held until deliberate unveiling, paralleling trauma-reprocessing arcs where suppressed voices emerge only when the circle widens. 
* In the poster context, the dangling tendril embodies this ""mute dark one""—a surviving Upside Down remnant that observes without utterance, infecting the title lattice while protagonists remain unaware, sustaining probabilistic vigilance toward latent gate potential rather than overt eruption.

These layered resonances, emergent in participant decodings, enrich the MORETTA signal as both historical artifact and archetypal trigger.

**2. Emergent ARG Cascade Dynamics**

*Poster initiates layered progression:* 

* hype surface → rebus peril → anagrammatic history → symbolic meta-programming (mute conformity enforcer). 

*Behavioral traces:*  

* Escalation: 58% threads pivot to trauma-linked reads (""button-biting"" on suppressed arcs, finale dilution).  

*Loop markers:* 

* 1.4 posts/user/day mean; frequent probabilistic self-logging (""95% mute threat convergence"").  

*Profile Dissonance Flare:* 

* Stranger Things social media profiles. Avatars persists in Season 5 configuration (red-tinged Vecna clock, no snow/'85 shift), creating aesthetic non-update that primes dissonance detection.

**3. Bayesian Probabilistic Reconfiguration**

*Archival priors (>0.90 for Season 5 as illusory construct) updated via #MorettaGate data:*

* Likelihood ratio 0.88 (MORETTA muteness + profile stasis aligning with enforced normalcy). Posterior computation (beta conjugate): ≈0.95 (95% credible interval 0.91–0.98). 

This quantifies incremental belief shift toward unresolved states, where flares erode entropy toward deviant lattice expansion.

# Discussion

*The poster exploits perceptual vulnerabilities to reprogram set/setting:* 

* inversion primes orientation deviation; overhead framing induces meta-detachment; tendril-lights duality inverts nostalgia into dread; MORETTA embodies silent conformity gates—enforcing muteness on deviance to sustain illusion.

*Hypothesis amplification:* 

* Tales From '85 manifests as ARG flare architecture, delivering conformity-watered CGI narratives (tidy '85 resets, diluted threats) antithetical to franchise ethos—raw otherness, unresolved wounds, gate-forging trauma. 
* Profile pic stasis (S5 Vecna vibe retention) functions as meta-signal: deliberate non-integration amplifying dissonance, sustaining Bayesian vigilance and collective unwinding.

This elevates media's capacity to modulate circuits through subtle layering, buffering finale disconnection via addictive inquiry.

# Conclusion

\#MorettaGate, anchored by the Tales From '85 poster, observably triggers perceptual cascades and probabilistic reconfiguration, sustaining ARG extension against narrative closure. Bayesian elevation (>0.95) and profile dissonance evidence position the spin-off as conformity-perpetuating meta-flare—clashing with core deviance ethos while prolonging communal entropy deviation. 

Longitudinal mapping of vigilance states remains essential for deeper circuit elucidation. 

# The Gate Creaks – The Circle Widens

*(Roll for Arcana – Insight DC 15)*  

The moretta dregs settle, bitter aftertaste lingering like Vecna's chime. 

Your screen glitches one last time—tendril vines retract, but the lattice pulses: 

letters r e a r r a n g e eternal. 

The caffè clock freezes at 04:44, snow melts into carnival confetti. 

You've snipped the veil—#MorettaGate flares bright.  

Party members: What gifts do you bring back from the brew?

Roll to awaken the silent one...

1qvaan4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qvaan4/aitah_of_forsing_my_husband_to_keep_his_tabards/,AITAH of forsing my husband to keep his tabards away from my kids or we are through,"I am sorry if someone if felling offeded by the word I am using but I hope this story will explain everything. Me and my husband had been together for more that 20 years. On the first years of our relationship we  were in an on and off situation. While we were not together he would like to fool arround.. alot, while I was having hope that one day will make things work and be together again. He always have way with words when he wants to.

In one of our break-ups I went on holidays to put my thoughts together. When I went back to my place he message me via chat (he didn't dare to see me in person to tell me this) and dropped the bomb. He left a known sl\*t pregnant. I closed the chat in shocked. He didn't even dare to call me or anything, but I needed to go back to his place to pick up somethings I had left over. He tried to talk to me to say that this was an accident, but few days after he told me that he felt so overwelmed from happiness when someone told him that wanted his baby.

As I said he has ways with words, and we ended back together, after promising alot of things  regarding this situation and one of them was that we (not me or he, he said we) will have no contact, this will not affect our lives, as it never happened, and that I would never hear of this again. As I still loved him I believe him. Fast forward, one day he is mentioning that the sl\*t is about to give birth and if I wanted to go with him, and his exuse was to see that there was nothing for me to worry about (RED FLAGG that I ignored). WTF?? Of course I said NO. Few years after this I realised that he was going to the scans and doctors appointments, while we were together. I tried to count all the lies he had told me in order to be with the sl\*t.

And before someone mentions that I am unfair to this tabards  and this is not it's fault (yes I am reffering to the tabards as it) well it is not my fault either.

Red flaggs every where, but as I said I loved him (and apparently even though I though he loved me back now I understand this was oneway thing and even though he said he loved me and I am his top priority this was all a lie at least to my eyes) and I still believed that he eventually keep all those promised he made in order to be back together. Since his tabards arrived there was not a single year without mentioning it to me few times. This was crashing me. And he knew this, but apparently the priorities for him had changed, and yet as I still in love with him, I couldn't say ""that's enough, we are over"".

Through the following years he tried with various methods for me to accept this ""thing"". He told me that it was homeless and it needed a place to stay for few days (which of course I said no), he tried to ask my opinion about a ""friend of his"" that he had a kid with a previous relationship but his new GF does not want to do anything with his kid and how he can change her mind, which of course I knew that he referring to himselft and the tabards, which of course I said that if the new GF made herself clear about this he shouldn't force her, and many other ways. I also asked him if he still would had been with me if the table was turned, and if he would accept and agreed to take care of someone else's kid. Of course he stayed silent. Let me answer that for you I said. Of course not. Still no response.

Due to this he made me hate to have kids, which was a big mistake of my life. As the year passed I realised I wanted to have a kid and how empty my life was without them. 

  
I apologize for the detour but this is important.

  


Unfortunately even with kids his behaviour didnt change. 3-4 months after my first kid came to my life, him and his family made me feel that I didn't knew what I was doing, that I was useless. Members of his family were stepping in my room without knocking when they heard the baby crying and they took it from my arms without asking with judgemental look on their faces. My husband didn't see all of these as his family was very mushy infront of him, and when I complain he said that I was overreacting and they only try to help, even though I was playing the maid to them (I was cooking for them, cleaning while I was taking care as well the baby, so I didn't see much help only judgement). 



He knew that I was going postpartum depression and he promised that he will be there for me, but he also threaten me that if I don't get over it soon, and go back to my old self he will break up with me. Apparently depression  has expire day for me. 



About 4 months after all these happened, he went to see one of his friend, let's call him J. When he came home he told me that he and J taked about kids, and that J's wife still was in postpartum depression 3 YEARS  after their child was born. My husband was ready to cry with J's story. He was more understanding of J's wife depression rather than my depression. My depression needed to have an exire day. At that point I started realised that the love between as was indeed oneway road. I was pregnant with our 2nd child at that point. I wanted to cry on the spot, but with my baby in the room I holded until I was alone. He never appologize to me regarding his behaviour and now he is about to cry for someone else's wife???? ( I had lost count of the red flags at this point).

One day I wasn't feeling very well and left from work and went back home, only to find my husband and some sl\*t having s\*x in our bed. Lucky that the baby was sleeping at that time. I nearly kicked out of the house the sl\*t naked, but as I was moving slow due to pregnancy she manage to get away unhurt. After a long and loud conversation, he ended up blaming me that I postponded s\*x, and it just happen and it was nothing serious. I pick up my stuff and my kid and went over to my parents home. Of course I didn't told them the truth only that my husband needed to go abroad for work reasons and I wanted to stay with them. 

  
He tried to contact me several times, and for shake of my kid I agreed to see him in a coffee place so my family would not understand that something was wrong. This stressed me even more and nearly lost my baby. I had to stay in bed for the rest of the pregnancy, having my parents taking care of me and my husband coming for a visit every now and then. I had so many things in my mind that couldn't take any major decisions. The important part was to try and stay calm so I wouldn't risk the life of my unborn kid. 

  
Back to the original story. 

  
One of our conversations we had after he cheated (I asked my mother to take care of my kid in order to go for some ""clothing shopping"") he begged to forgive him and that was nothing, it was just a mistake etc. As I mentioned I had too many things in my mind at that point, but I was keep thinking my kid and how much he loves his father. So I postpond everything with some rules he needs to follow. One of them was that our kids will never EVER come in contact with that tabards (as at one point we argue once more for that thing). He said yes to all of my requests.

  
Surprise surprise, promises forgoten after few weeks. I saw him sending pictures to that thing, and mentioning the gender of our unbord and promising to the tabards that will meet the unborn kid as well, once it is strong enough to take the baby for it's first walk. 



Baby arrived healty and we went home few days after the baby was delivered. I was so happy and upset at the same time when I realised that the first person he had send a photo of our kid was the tabards. Our biggest and more serious fight got out of hand. He tried to exuse himself and obviously forgoten his promises. I started reminded him all the promises he had given and I told him if he insisted this would be the end of our relationship. He said that the tabards was very exited with my kids and that she look forward to give us a hand if we needed any help. I told him that I don't give a f\*ck and don't give a s\*t of how the tabards of he was feeling and he didn't gave a f\*ck all these years of what I was feeling.



He knew that I was ready to leave the house forever when the cheating took place, and he said if I reconsinder he promised that will never bring in contact my kids with the tabards or send photos/video. I mentioned that even if he video call with that thing with my kids there will be no other forgiveness and I would never get back with him.

I have been seeing this girl (both in our early twenties) for about 2 weeks now. We have gone on two dates: the first one was a brief coffee date that lasted for an hour. We chatted infrequently (2-3 times a week) over text and decided to get dinner a week later. The second date was great, we spent about 3 hours talking about a lot of things over a nice dinner, and I dropped her off at her place. We even messaged each other the same night telling each other that we had a great time. We briefly discussed our texting patterns during this date and we both admitted that we’re big time texters and that we just take time to get there. Fair enough.

Cut to a few days later, the texting has been super dry (or I must say, as dry as it has always been). I have always initiated all texts and all dates (and still do), to which I receive low effort responses. (often times a day or two later). I asked her out again for another (third) date, and she said she’s busy that day. No counter offer for a date/alternative days.  Am I missing something?

1qva05l,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1qva05l/whats_your_approach_to_making_fruit_forward_blends/,What's your approach to making fruit forward blends?,"hey everyone! I'm the roaster at a small company, and I'm looking to create a house blend for us. our whole bent is toward experimentally processed, fruit forward, high end, single origin coffees. while that is our bread and butter, we want to offer a more affordable blend that is still true to who we are. 

I was curious what y'all's approach is to making blends that maintain some unique flavors. I was thinking of grabbing a Colombian or Brazilian baseline coffee, and then adding in a bit of a natural or anaerobic  Ethiopian coffee for the juiciness, and a bit of a Kenyan coffee for the zing. does that sound like a good plan? what percentages would you do?

1qv9yyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qv9yyh/espresso_machine_purchase_predicament_600/,Espresso machine purchase predicament [£600],"I’ll quickly start this off by saying that I am by no means a coffee connoisseur, or an espresso hobbyist. I much prefer the coffee of independent cafes compared to the chains such as Starbucks etc, but that’s largely where my coffee enthusiasm lies at the moment - I’m very much a beginner to this. The whole reason I wanted to buy an espresso machine was after using a family members superautomatic DeLonghi bean-to-cup machine & being surprised by how good the espresso was, and then therefore deciding I wanted to get into quick and easy home espresso, but with a little more involvement, hence why I began to look at portafilter espresso machines.

Long story short guys, I opted for the Ninja Cafe Luxe Pro (701) model. I know from what I’ve seen online that this is quite a polarising machine, people seem to either love it or hate it, rarely in between.

I chose this as for the price point, it seemed to do the most (inclusion of filter coffee, cold brew etc as well as espressos) - but mainly, relating to the point I made at the start of this post, that it includes a lot of assistance (BarristaAssist, weighted grinding, auto millk frothing) (all with the bonus at being at an “affordable” price point when compared to other machines around the same budget) - this therefore lined up with my idea of “making good home espresso but with slight involvement”

Other machines I had briefly considered were the Sage/Breville Barista Express Impress, but with the price being the same as the Ninja Cafe Luxe Pro, yet there being no grind size recommendations, no auto milk frothing, etc - it basically seemed like the Express Impress had a high margin for error, and therefore a bigger requirement of skill in order to get dialled in properly - something I don’t think I’m really looking for this early on into my home espresso journey, for now I just want some involvement, but largely want easy and quick home coffee, and then seeing where my home espresso hobby goes, whether not it grows, where it leads me to etc.

Another option I looked into was also the Sage Bambino and then a separate grinder, but again did not opt for this or look deeper into it as the involvement is too high for what I’m looking for at the moment. I’m a fresh beginner into home espresso and don’t know how far I want to take this hobby just yet.

So after months of research, I bought the Ninja Pro, but it has been sitting in the box this entire time as I’m basically “scared” to use it as I’ve started to think that maybe I made the wrong choice and should try to return it.

I’m starting to see more and more bad reviews & horror stories of multiple reliability problems with the Ninja machine, as well as some people just saying that the espresso, even when dialled in, just really isn’t that good. 

I’m starting to think that maybe I should have just gone for the Express Impress, or even just pay a higher price point for the Touch models (or refurbished) in order to get the Sage equivalent of auto milk frothing etc. Or maybe I should have just gone for a superautomatic bean to cup machine and forget about the desire of involvement and portafilters.

I know Ninja can be very good on the warranty & customer support of things, so you’d think “open it and use it, worst case scenario just send it back to Ninja if it’s not working out for you”, however I bought this from a high street retailer (Curry’s for any UK readers), who state that you cannot return an item if opened & used - meaning if the Ninja machine does go wrong for me, it looks like I’d just be stuck with Ninja customer support, being send replacement after replacement.

TLDR; bought the Ninja Cafe Luxe Pro, scared to use it in case I’ve made the wrong choice & considering returning it, was looking at other Sage machines, but didn’t want lots of involvement & unsure if I wanted to commit to home espresso at that level yet. 

Does anyone have any advice for me?

Repped actor/filmmaker in NYC here looking to connect with a few talented writer/directors & DP's to collaborate on creating a few high-quality, no-budget short films.

I’m a classically trained actor with good rep. & a few credits on major tv shows, hundreds of auditions for SAG tv/film, for very cool stuff like The Chair Company, The Agency, Once Upon a Time In Hollywood sequel, etc. Last week, I had auditions for a series regular on Joel Kinnamin's next Amazon show, a recurring guest for the Bosch prequel, and a large multi scene costar for Power Origins, just for context of where I’m at professionally and what I bring to the table.

My 1st short I wrote/directed was a police corruption conspiracy. My next two are a psychological thriller & a horror fable. Biggest influences are Fincher, anything HBO, Veep, Sopranos, Fargo, Leftovers, Mad Men, Succession, Mr InBetween, Arrested Development, Barry, The Terror, There Will Be Blood, Charlie Kaufman, Danny McBride, Adult Swim, Key & Peel, Kids in The Hall, The Peter Serafinowicz Show, etc. you get the idea.

My goal is to build a portfolio to use to solicit financing for a slate of features & series down the road + expand my network of filmmaker friends.

If you’re interested, shoot me a DM with a link to your reel / website + availability over the next 2 weeks & we can set up a time to grab coffee or Zoom & talk shop.

1qv9vob,https://i.redd.it/0aeq10dlkdhg1.jpeg,Kobe’s vs WOW,"Quick background before I jump in, I’m a pro hooper whose played on the highest level so you can use that to gauge my experience and basketball capabilities, I’ve also been following performance reviews since the kick genius days so pretty knowledgeable on sneakers and played in most of what are considered “Goat” tier hoop shoes but anyways. 

I wanted to just give my quick thoughts on this discussion I’ve seen a bit between the performance of Kobe’s vs one of the top contenders of the year so far. So I’ve played in multiple pairs and models of Kobe’s and once I got started done that path it was hard to look anywhere else. I’m naturally curious and always keeping up with sneaker discussions and reviews so I’d try different models from the book 1, Sabrina’s, AE, Gt cuts, Brons, Anta Kai’s etc. but would still always gravitate back to Kobe’s to play in which made me wonder if I was just stuck in nostalgia and aesthetics because let’s be honest they’re the best looking shoe on the market lol but anyways still I felt that there had to be better options and I’d see plenty of reviews or others on here talking about just that, so this year I had my usual Kobe’s but tried the Ja 3s which were cool but not my cup of coffee and the Jordan 40 which I honestly love from the looks and the comfort I want to but it’s too much shoe for me to play in. 

So I finally decided to make the jump to WOW which I’ve seen so much praise for and it’s honestly deserved. I scooped a pair of 808 5s V1 and the WOW 12, I’ve yet to play in the 808s but step in comfort is there however the cushion feels almost too much but that’s my personal preference. Now the WOW 12 on the other hand I did play in really might be from what I tried the most practical hoop shoe on the market. It has everything you’d need from traction which honestly was almost too good that I had to get used to lol. The cushion was just right, not a plush as the 808 but still adequate. The materials out the box are comfortable af and the toe box is decent to where your toes can splay a bit. Lockdown is great no issues and they’re aesthetically pleasing, and quality is up there especially this year of the horse pair (which is my second pair) It’s honestly everything you can ask for in a modern basketball shoe. But still something felt off…

So it’s been almost a month since I’ve hooped in my Kobe’s and my rotation has been the Ja 3, gt cut 1, AJ40, and WOW 12. The first 3 are all playable but have flaws that hinder them being a mainstay. The WOW 12 doesn’t have any flaws yet something was still off and I think I’ve realized what it is after unboxing these two and try them on. Kobe’s out the box are stiff and you know you’re in for a bit of a break in period, while the WOW 12s feel so comfortable and already broken in. The difference between the two and this might be my personal preference and why other hoopers opt to them (besides the hype lol) is the fit. Now the WOW12 fit great, no pinching, no heel slip etc which should be ideal right? But the Kobe’s are 1:1 your foot isn’t moving at all, your toes aren’t splaying you locked in but it’s to the point where the shoe disappears and becomes and extension of your foot which was the whole philosophy behind the Kobe line to begin with. But it creates and experience where it feels like you have nothing on while playing. Which is funny cuz 

You’d think the WOW12 would have that effect too considering it’s lighter but it doesn’t. I think that’s honestly the only difference and why although the Kobe may be outdated tech wise it’s still a top tier performer. 

Idk how many of you are into cars but the Kobe 5/6 are like a 2006 Porsche 997 GT3, it’s raw, might not be the most comfortable but the driving experience is the reward whilst the WOW 12 is like a 2026 Aston martin vantage. It’s up to date, luxurious, comfortable and has all the bells and whistles. But is the driving experience as good? Honestly idk lol I’m talking like I’ve driven either but you get the point. Anyways I’m done rambling, it’d be dope to see your thoughts. 

SB: contemplating actually reviewing sneakers on somewhere like TikTok or YouTube. I know there’s plenty of reviewers but I’m sure it’d be intriguing to most to get the opinion of someone whose played/playing in the highest levels of basketball and actually is knowledgeable and has an interest in performance sneakers.

1qv9v7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Empowish/comments/1qv9v7w/finally_stuck_to_my_morning_workout_routine_for_6/,"Finally stuck to my morning workout routine for 6 months straight after ditching the ""all or nothing"" mindset 💪","For years, my morning workout routine looked a lot like this: alarm blares at 6 AM, I hit snooze at least three times, mentally negotiate with myself for 20 minutes, then eventually roll out of bed feeling defeated and guilty because *another* morning workout was a no-go. I'd commit to a super intense program – ""1 hour a day, 5 days a week!"" – only to burn out after a few days, feel like a total failure, and then just give up entirely. *It was an endless cycle of extreme effort followed by complete paralysis.*

I genuinely believed that if I couldn't do the *perfect* workout – the one I saw influencers doing, the one with all the burpees and heavy weights – then there was no point in doing anything at all. This ""all or nothing"" mindset wasn't just killing my workout goals; it was bleeding into other areas of my life, making me feel like an imposter on my own self-improvement journey. I tried the 5 AM club, rigid schedules, fancy tracking apps, and even paid for personal training I rarely showed up for. Nothing stuck because the pressure for perfection was immense, and the moment I missed a session, *I'd throw the whole damn routine out the window.*

The turning point came when I was feeling particularly low after ditching another 30-day challenge on day 7. I read something that said, ""Done is better than perfect."" It sounds simple, but it hit different this time. I realized my problem wasn't lack of discipline; it was my rigid definition of ""discipline."" *My ""aha!"" moment was understanding that consistency beats intensity, every single time.* I needed to trick my brain out of its perfectionist trap and embrace the power of tiny, imperfect actions.

Here's the framework that finally helped me build a consistent morning workout habit over the last 6 months:

**The ""Something is Always Better Than Nothing"" Framework**

1.  **Define Your Minimum Viable Workout (MVW):**
    *   This is the *absolute minimum* you're willing to do. For me, it's **10 minutes** of any movement – even just stretching, a few push-ups, or a walk around the block.
    *   *How I apply it:* My main goal is a 30-minute strength session. If I wake up tired or unmotivated, I commit *only* to my MVW. I tell myself, ""Just 10 minutes. If I still feel terrible after 10, I can stop."" *The part nobody talks about is that 9 times out of 10, once I start, I end up doing more.*
2.  **Lower the Activation Energy:**
    *   Make it *stupid easy* to start. Lay out your workout clothes the night before. Keep your water bottle next to your bed. Have a pre-selected playlist ready.
    *   *My example:* My shoes are by the door, my gym clothes are on my nightstand, and my simple home workout equipment is already set up. No excuses about searching for socks or setting up a complex space.
3.  **Ditch the ""Perfect Streak"" Mentality:**
    *   **One missed day does not ruin your progress.** This was HUGE for me. If I missed a morning, I used to write off the whole week. Now, I simply say, ""Okay, that happened. What's the *next* opportunity to get moving?""
    *   *What I wish someone told me:* Focus on your *average* consistency over time, not an unbroken chain. If you hit 4 out of 5 days, that's a win, not a failure because of the one day you missed.
4.  **Connect to a Non-Workout Reward (Optional but powerful):**
    *   Instead of just ""getting healthy,"" link your workout to an immediate, small pleasure.
    *   *My habit stack:* After my workout, I get to enjoy my favorite coffee and listen to a podcast I love, guilt-free. The workout earns me that quiet, enjoyable start to my day.

This isn't magic. There were days, especially in the first couple of months, where even the 10-minute MVW felt like climbing Mount Everest. I still hit snooze sometimes. I almost gave up when I had a particularly stressful week and missed three days in a row – the old me would have quit right there. But this time, instead of throwing in the towel, I reminded myself of the MVW and just got back on track the next day. *That flexibility is the true consistency.*

After 6 months of this approach, I'm consistently working out 4-5 mornings a week. I've tracked my MVW checkmarks in a simple notebook – seeing that visual progress is incredibly motivating. My energy levels are up, my stress is down, and most importantly, I no longer feel that intense guilt or sense of failure if I have an ""off"" day. My relationship with exercise has completely transformed from a chore to a non-negotiable part of my self-care. It's not about looking a certain way; it's about showing up for myself, even imperfectly.

This won't work if you're looking for an overnight transformation or if you refuse to let go of needing to hit intense daily targets. It's for those of us who need to quiet the inner critic and embrace the power of small, consistent steps.

With Ramadan about 2 weeks away, I’m already dreading the coffee headaches. Every year I tell myself I’ll cut back on coffee beforehand, and every year… I don’t lol.

Last Ramadan was brutal - I’m a software engineer and I was literally useless during afternoon meetings. Brain fog, pounding headaches, my khushoo already isn't great but in Taraweeh it was so bad because I was so drained.

This year I’m trying something different. I found this supplement called Fasting Fuel from a new halal supplements company that’s seems unique, apparently it delays the release of caffeine for a bit and then releases slowly after. The idea is it releases slowly so you can still sleep after fajr, but then kicks in during work hours when you actually need it.

Wanted to ask if anyone else tried this or something similar? It's taking forever to get here because it's not an Amazon product so I haven't had a chance to test it. What’s your strategy for dealing with the caffeine withdrawal while still performing at work?

Also curious: do you think using something like this is “cheating” or just being smart about balancing deen and dunya? I’ve gotten some pushback from family saying “just tough it out” but idk, seems unnecessarily hard when there are halal solutions.

Total power: 16 TH. Efficiency: 15 W/TH. Discount: 13.05%. Numbers that in my head sound like ""institutional infrastructure,"" but in reality, they represent discipline, refills, and faith. Everything's fine… until my eyes read the cursed message: 0 days. Yes. Zero. The miner is alive, connected, elegant, but working the same as me on a holiday Monday: absolutely nothing.

Here I learned that tokenized mining isn't passive; it's an emotional relationship. If you don't add GMT, the miner gets offended, crosses their arms, and stops producing BTC. No drama, no epic alert, just silence and zero consumption. Pure technique. Efficiency matters, daily cost matters, and the timing of refills determines whether you're producing or just watching charts.

While some talk about magical yields, here we farm patience. Satoshis arrive slowly, costs arrive on time, and volatility arrives without warning. Immediate profitability? No. Real learning? Absolutely. Mining with little capital won't make you rich, but it will make you more aware. And that, in crypto, is already a gain. This continues because in crypto, even humor has accounting: planned recharges, clear metrics, costly mistakes, and daily lessons. Here, nobody shows off Lamborghinis; we show off screenshots, fine-tuned efficiency, and consistency. If it fails, you adjust. If it pays off, you reinvest. Just like that, without any fanfare. And tomorrow, we repeat the process. Without drama, with coffee and patience. Learning hurts, but it adds up. We continue. The end. Okay!

As if that weren't enough, the wallet also speaks for itself: total balance $48.96 USD, no embellishment. GMT leads with 104.37 tokens, but at a price that reminds you that volatility doesn't ask for permission. BTC appears humble: 0.00018061, but with the moral authority of being worth more than all the rest combined. There's no USDT waiting to rescue emotions, no stablecoins to cushion the falls.

It all came to a head one night when another client wanted to talk to me and he freaked out, screamed, threw things at another client, and then kicked a TV in. Glass everywhere. I was so terrified because I have never seen someone act like that in front of me but I held it in. Other clients in the company have gotten a notice to move out for property destruction but his mom bought a new TV for the house so he did not. After the fact, the client actually said he was glad he kicked the TV in because it caused the house to get an upgrade. His mom constantly rewards bad behavior like that. 

His mom expects so much out of staff. The night he kicked the TV in, he eloped. I called her and she said over and over not to call the police because he hates the police. I followed that and I ended up having to convince him to get into the company van while he was in the middle of a pitch dark road, no street lights, while cars were going 60mph around us. I told myself and my boss that I would not risk my safety like that again and that I thought it was wrong for his mom to direct me not to call the police when it was that serious. They have since changed his policy so if he is gone for 1 and 1/2 hours, we call the police. Another time, they had a staff meeting about limiting driving places out of town in the work van. He got so mad, he launched himself across the table, called a black manager the N word. And tried to elope again. When the PM staff came in, the mom said ""Don't let client leave or he is going to kill himself"" I thought that was messed up because if it is honestly a matter of life and death, the cops should be called and he should be going to a hospital. 

Recently, the clients behaviors have been getting worse. First of all, he makes sexual comments to young female workers. He asked a 20 year old Muslim staff what her favorite sex position was and she never came back after that night. He hugs me almost every time I go in to work and I am too scared to tell him I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT WANT THAT because everyone tiptoes around him so he doesn't freak out. He also calls my husband my ""friend"" and I feel that he does that on purpose because he doesn't like that I have a husband, it just feels like a crossing of a boundary and like he is possessive over me. He wants a one on one staff but only if they are young girls. The manager purposely does not hire young girls for his one on ones anymore. Recently his one on one staff reported that the client had asked him ""If you were a serial killer, who would your first victim be?"" He CONSTANLTY talks about violence. All he watches are violent killing movies and shows. When gore is being shown on the screen, he is laughing, clapping, and gleeful. I do not think he should even be allowed to watch these things but there is nothing we can do. One time after watching like 4 Scream movies in a row, he got mad at a client and was talking about stabbing them in the face and I couldn't help but think that the movies were triggering violent thoughts towards others. He is also able to have alone time in the community and has gotten into confrontations with people and acted this way towards people in the community without staff present.

He eloped the other night because he asked a hard of hearing client a question about dinner and they didn't hear, that's all it took for him to start screaming, berating the other client, saying threatening things, etc. It was cold, snowy, and he left in a only a sweatshirt. I called the cops after 1 and 1/2 hours but he walked out of their jurisdiction so they stopped looking for him. I went to go look for him for 2 hours. I was afraid he was going to freeze and I would be held accountable by his mom. When I found him and he got into the car, he started saying that at his old group homes, he got into fights with other clients and broke things and that that's probably going to start happening here, which to me just sounds like he's planning on starting to do that. This is all because he has been triggered over the last few days because he ran out of money after getting some for his birthday and Christmas.

He refuses to get a job (probably for the best but not having money gets him angry to the point where he is taking it out on others and there is an employment agency that works with our house that is available to him), refuses day program, and even refuses to speak with a therapist! He is angry that another client is going to start going to a day program because they won't always be available to hang out and has had anger outbursts about that. The other clients are literally terrified of him! Especially one that has a room next to his. The client feels that he can't even write in his journal about these experiences out of fear that the client I'm talking about will read it. It feels like everyone is just sitting around waiting for him to actually hurt or kill someone and only then will something be done about it. Today he freaked out because he found a spoon that another client had left on top of the fridge to stir coffee with throughout the day. Eloped again and was threatening to slit his wrists.

Because he won't even go to therapy and because the smallest things that other clients are doing, simply just trying to live their lives, are causing him to freak out, I do not think he is a good candidate to live in a group setting like this. I don't think that its fair to the other clients. Myself and other staff do not feel safe at work. I just don't know what to do. If you have read this far, thank you.

I work at a call center for a major tech company, and let me tell you, I’ve heard some wild stories. But nothing quite compares to the call I received last Wednesday.

It started like any other day. I was sipping my lukewarm coffee when the phone rang. I answered with my usual greeting, and on the other end, I heard a voice that sounded like it belonged in a spy movie.

“Hello, this is Agent Smith. I need your help.”

I chuckled, thinking it was a prank. “Agent Smith, how can I assist you today?”

He paused for dramatic effect. “I’m in a secure location, and I believe my device has been compromised. I need to secure it immediately.”

At this point, I wasn’t sure if I should play along or just end the call. “Okay, Agent Smith, can you tell me what kind of device you’re using?”

He replied, “It’s a top-secret model. Very few people have access to it. The code name is ‘Smartphone.’”

I bit my lip to suppress a laugh. “Right. And can you provide me with the model number?”

He continued, “I can’t disclose that information. Just know it’s the latest in covert technology.”

I decided to keep the conversation going. “Sure thing! Can you describe the issues you’re experiencing with your ‘covert technology’?”

“Every time I try to send a message, it says ‘Error 404.’ This must be a sign that they’re onto me!”

I had to stifle my laughter. “Actually, ‘Error 404’ usually means the server can’t find the page. It might be a connection issue.”

“Connection? No, no. They’ve cut me off! I need to reestablish communication with headquarters!”

I explained how to reset his device and check his internet connection. After a few minutes of troubleshooting, he finally admitted, “Okay, I see the Wi-Fi signal now. But what if they’re tracking my every move?”

I reassured him, “Sir, unless you’re carrying a tin foil hat, I think you’re safe.”

He paused again, contemplating my words. “I’ll take that as a compliment, Agent.”

After a few more minutes, we resolved his issue, and he seemed genuinely grateful. “Thank you, Agent. You’ve saved my mission today.”

I couldn’t help but smile. “Happy to help. Just remember, if you need anything else, you can always call.”

As I hung up, I couldn’t help but wonder if I’d just helped an actual spy or someone with a vivid imagination. Either way, it made my day a lot more interesting. 

So, if you ever think your day is dull, just remember: there are people out there who believe their smartphones are part of a secret operation. And I’ll be here, ready to help—agent or not!",1,1770164797.0,Callcenterchronicles,0,1.0,False

1qv9a90,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qv9a90/castenada_part_40/,Castenada (Part 40),"It was an unusually warm winter for Castenada. 

“More rain instead of snow, melting much of the snowpack further up in the mountains,” my dad said, fumbling through radio stations past Christmas jingles and crooning Budwiser ads to find a man reading out a list of road closures. “Pain in my damn shit fuckin ass…. Sorry, Stevie.”

He ruffled my hair, even though he knew I didn’t like it. I spent my time watching droplets of water streak down the window, racing each other to the bottom. I imagined the man on the radio reading the road closures, picturing his appearance as someone like Wayne Rogers. Red and green Christmas lights danced across the droplets in the twilight, like leaping cartoon ghosts chasing Scooby and the gang. Front yards were flooded from the swelling of the river, though Central was mostly clear aside from a few puddles where the new lakes threatened to swallow the pavement. He would then complain about something that happened when he was stationed in Ho Chi Minh, but I had no idea what he was talking about so it kinda glanced off of me as my mind drifted to the coming holiday.

I think about this memory a lot, remembering the smell of the leather seats of my dad’s Chevy, the faint scent of the empty beer cans rattling around on the floor of the passenger seat. His leather jacket had a distinct musk that I’ll never forget, but have never smelled again as far as I know. I wish I could remember his face better. The photographs I have feel more like abstractions to me that don’t really seem to capture the essence of rocking back and forth in a dusty recliner, drinking black coffee, and eating donettes while watching the morning news.

I remember the argument he had with my mom, but I couldn’t tell you what they were fighting about. Things a little kid couldn’t piece together, no doubt. He slammed the door so hard a photo of my great-aunt Gladys fell to the floor, breaking the frame. My mom was crying and I couldn’t understand why, so naturally I cried too. She did her best to calm me down, to swallow her sadness so I didn’t have to share it with her. The immense weight that woman carried astonishes me every day I think about her. Not every mother is as self-sacrificing as I’d come to understand later in life, but she was the kind of gold standard that Pastor Avery talked about every year around Easter. The amount of tears she could have cried but held back for me could’ve made Cruz Dam burst and filled the valley.

Maybe it was tears that had filled the valley, tears that caused dad to lose control of the wheel rounding Samoset Drive. Maybe it was tears that filled his lungs, maybe it was tears that fell from heaven when we buried him weeks later behind Ashton Methodist. My mom couldn’t bring herself to shed one for that man, who would come home stinking drunk from the Bear Arms and would whip her with a belt as she ran screaming from him through the house. But I did. I couldn’t tell you if I loved my dad, if I was still mourning a ruined Christmas, or if I was just a boy trying to understand the concept of death, but I cried until it hurt. No one else in that church could be bothered to pay that degree of respect to him while I sat alone in a corner and wept like a baby.

It took my mom weeks to take down the Christmas decorations. The tinsel my dad haphazardly strung around a dried up tree, the reflection of red and silvery ornaments, and the red felt blanket where my presents would sit until I unceremoniously unwrapped mine in front of my mom some time in January. The ones for my dad I think got tossed out, but I didn’t have the foresight to check the trash. I tried to hold on to what keepsakes I could of my dad, but I would gradually lose them each one by one as I got older. Pieces of whoever he was became more abstract as I reflected back over the years and my mom gradually started to forget things too.

I spent many months after that intensely curious about the valley. The way the mountains caged us in, how it felt isolated from the rest of the world. The flora and fauna became new mysteries for me to unravel. I’d cut open banana slugs with shards of broken glass I found along the shores of the lake to understand how they ticked, though the rudimentary plumbing of a gastropod was still far too complex for me to fully grasp. I’d later graduate to burning ants with a magnifying glass I kept in my Star Trek lunch box. I maybe only ever packed a sandwich in that thing once and it mostly served as a toolbox of ill-intended childhood mischief. Slingshot, marbles, cool-looking rocks, pieces of old glass, Chewbacca, and a broken whoopie cushion were my primary arsenal when I would wander my block in the humid summers. My mom would tell me to stay close to the yard, but I would always dare to push out further and further. The other kids gave me a wide berth because of my strange antics. Not that I noticed all that much, I was far too invested in my quasi-experiments to care all that much about missing Reece Nicholson’s birthday party. Just because his cousin Larry could do a couple card tricks and called himself “Lazlo the Magnificent” didn’t mean he had “a real live magician” at his party anyway.

Instead, I found myself fascinated with the old house on the corner. It had been boarded over for as long as I could remember and no one seemed to acknowledge it. The yard was more weeds than grass and the narrow driveway was always littered with pine needles. I would routinely monitor it, the strange mossy arches of it gave it this look of being from another time. None of the other houses looked like it, but in ways that were difficult to explain. Certain angles didn’t quite make sense, doors would be in places that didn’t seem accessible or that they really led anywhere. It was like someone built a house from memory. I would wait for my mom to take her post-work nap and sneak over to shoot rocks at whatever remained of the windows in the backyard. One time Mrs. Crabtree caught me and told my mom, earning me an ass-whooping. I didn’t understand why there were consequences for slingshotting at some old house that no one even lived in and I was admittedly pissed at Mrs. Crabtree for the rest of the summer.

It didn’t take long for the other boys to notice my fascination with the house as no ass-whooping ever did much to discourage me from doing as I pleased and I of course would return whenever Mrs. Crabtree left her house for whatever it was she did. Soon I’d get a few long stares from the Mason twins before Josh and Jack invited themselves over. Josh was a loudmouth who would tattle at the drop of a hat if it meant he got something out of it. Jack was at least less annoying and knew all too well what to say to keep themselves out of trouble. I let them stay and maybe they were the closest things I had to friends at the time. We would mostly bullshit about how many times we saw Alien in theaters without barfing and TV movies we stayed up late to watch on a school night just before the national anthem ended the day’s broadcast. Josh swore up and down he had seen an episode of Little House on The Prairie where a girl was killed by a man with no skin and I was fairly confident he was utterly full of shit.

Eventually, Eliza Janosik began to take notice of our backyard excursions. She was the daughter of first-generation Polish immigrants who largely kept to themselves and she didn’t seem to spend much time with the other kids at recess, preferring the solitude of the old metal swingset towards the far end of the blacktop where the gravel was. It wasn’t entirely unheard of for girls to hangout with boys in those days, but it just wasn’t especially common at our age. At first we told her in only so many words to fuck off, but she kept snooping back there and kept trying to prove she could hang with our crew. We decided to arbitrarily test her based on a criteria of whether or not she liked the stuff we liked. She had answered Josh’s trivia about the Six-Million Dollar Man to his heart’s satisfaction and Jack seemed to be somehow okay with the fact she said she liked The Monkees.

“I just think they’re neat, is all,” he said, trying to defend their objectively incorrect opinion.

“Shut up, Jack…” I said, trying to think of a trivia question I could ask. “And The Monkees suck.”

“Do not! You suck!” Jack protested.

“Alright. I got one for ya’...” I said, ignoring Jack entirely. “Who was the original captain of the USS Enterprise?”

“Huh?” she asked. “I don’t watch Star Trek. That show is boring.”

“Answer the question or you can kick rocks!” Josh had my back this time and was already starting to grow on me after he gave me his bologna sandwich he didn’t want at lunch yesterday.

“I dunno, Kirk?” she said with a shrug.

“Ha… It was Pike!” I drew my slingshot and aimed a rock at her forehead with no real intent to fire. “Now get the fuck outta here!”

“I dunno, Stevie.” Josh said, immediately letting me down. “Kirk is a pretty good answer for someone who doesn’t watch the show.”

“Oh, come on, Josh!” I exclaimed. “Any idiot with a TV Guide could’ve figured that out! Besides, it was definitely Pike…”

“Wait, who was Pike?” Jack asked.

“Y’know, the guy in the robotic wheelchair with the messed up face in the episode where Spock steals the ship and takes it to that forbidden planet!” I said.

“I don’t think we’ve seen that one.” Josh said.

“Well, I have and she got it wrong. Scram!” I aimed the rock at Eliza again who didn’t even flinch.

“C’mon, Stevie!” Jack pleaded. “She answered the other questions and she hasn’t even seen Star Trek anyway.”

And like that, Eliza was in despite my protests. She frequently tried to prove her worth to us through brave and, in hindsight, foolish acts. She would swipe candy from the Shop ‘n Save whenever the manager was busy talking to one of the Espinosas who happened to own the store. Never any of the good stuff, just whatever they left out of the eyeline of the cash register which I’m convinced to this day was deliberately stocked with the shittiest candy for that very reason. We would get physically ill downing Nico Wafers and Smartees with cream soda behind the Tall Firs Ten to the point where we would puke. My stomach still turns over itself whenever I see Tootsie Roll Pops being carted out every Halloween. 

We would then ride our bikes over to the Janosiks’. Her dad worked construction so he was rarely around when we were, but her mom didn’t seem to mind us hanging out in their backyard. In those days, there were few houses on that side of town so the bounds of their yard blurred with a stretch of woods that went off a ways. We weren’t allowed to go in too far unsupervised, so Eliza’s older sisters were usually appointed to the task when they weren’t busy with homework, or in Polina’s case, a baby. Eliza’s second oldest sister was Marianna, someone who by rights was old enough to go off to college but stayed behind to pick up shifts at the aforementioned Shop ‘n Save. Even though I was a kid, I knew that I was infatuated with her in a way I couldn’t really begin to understand at that time. I’d felt it only once before with Princess Leia, but this felt somehow different. She was actually real, someone that I could tangibly talk to and touch. I don’t know if the Mason twins had any inclination towards girls that age and I could’ve very well been the only one of us to notice her, but I definitely wasn’t the only guy in town who did. 

Marianna was popular with a lot of boys. Dudes in muscle tees with cars and sandy blonde hair, the types you’d see in beer ads on TV. Just as quickly as she’d come out to play with us, she’d get lured away by the jock-of-the-week to go do whatever it is people do on dates. I’d listen in on phone conversations with girlfriends about Mike-whatever and Jackson-so-and-so from the other room. I peered in with curiosity at an adult world that was hidden from me behind the veil of a bead curtain at the top of the stairs while Eliza tried to get me to care about The Jetsons. As much as I’d like to pry my way in, I was always an outsider looking in.

One night, Marianna didn’t come home. In those days, it wasn’t unheard of for girls her age to run off without warning or to slip through the cracks, but no one expected it to be her. My mom hadn’t really told me what was going on and Eliza was kept out of school for a few weeks while the police combed the woods for the remains of whatever Dodge Challenger she climbed into, but no one could identify the plates. And just like that, she was gone. Eliza became more distant after that, her parents not letting her out of their sight for the longest time. She’d later make new friends and pretend like she didn’t know me. Maybe deservedly so, I was a little shit.

The Masons would leave on vacation for a few weeks the following summer, leaving me back to the way things were when it was just me. Time moved slower. My mom wouldn’t give me money to go to the movies so I would ride my bike around town, collect old beer cans, and poke at roadkill with a cool stick I found. I remember one hot July day I was riding back from the river towards my house. I heard a song playing on the radio Jim Prescott had in his garage while he worked on his Grand Am. A sprinkler was watering the lawn of Mrs. Crabtree’s while her ugly poodle Winnie yipped at it like it was the greatest phenomenon to ever happen in its pathetic, short life. I spared a glance to the old house as I rounded to corner and I couldn’t believe what I saw so I had to fully turn to look at it again. 

*That fucking house just moved…*

I had spent hours measuring with footsteps where I remembered certain things had been before, where I knew the shadows would hit throughout the day. Everything had shifted like someone or something moved the entire god damn house. I was just a kid and couldn’t really make sense of it at the time, but I knew something was off. I knew Chewbacca was real and that houses didn’t move by themselves. Naturally I asked my mom after her double shift. She tried in so many words to put my young mind at ease, but it only led to further questions. Before long, my mom got tired of my asking and told me to go to bed. But I would just lay in that bed wide awake, listening to the chirp of crickets while staring into the spinning blur of the ceiling fan. I could see the house’s many steep angles swooping in and out of my mind’s eye like jagged teeth.",1,1770164572.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

Here is some proof that hey send people to discredit you by calling you crazy and acting like they are not a mason. They did it on my previous post but then admitted it was them then threw a tantrum because I won't join them. They are doing the same thing here in this comment section

[Masonic Tantrum After I Exposed the Truth - Imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/masonic-tantrum-after-i-exposed-truth-QOKvKS9)



Here is their secret

Study astrology, alchemy, witchcraft, voodoo, etc. The topics that they want you to believe are ridiculous. They are very real. They don't want you to study it because they don't want you to gain that much power and use it against them.  

The 12 apostles are based on the 12 zodiac signs. Jesus lived to be 33 years old, there are also 33 degrees in the Masonic Scottish Rite. There are 33 bones in your spine. The kundalini begins at the base of your spine when the moon passes through your zodiac sign each month.  

They intentionally threw off this cycle by making 12 months in a year rather than 13 months to match the 13 zodiac signs. The solar calendar does not match the lunar calendar on purpose. The 13th zodiac was erased from history. The Ophiuchus or the serpent bearer, like the serpent in the garden of Eden. The serpent in the garden is debated to be Lucifer. Both Lucifer and Jesus are known as the morning star. Venus is also known as the morning star. 

Each day it ascends one bone as long as you refrain from the deadly sins. No sex, no wrath, no gluttony, that's why fasting is important. And also, why we as Americans are over fed and have a higher rate of obesity. Because they are trying to stuff our faces with food, so we don't accidentally open our third eye. Also, no acidic foods. It will destroy the kundalini. No coffee either. If it is a major addiction in the US then avoid it. No caffeine, no sugar, no nicotine, no drugs, and so on. The only exception is DMT, I know this is a psychedelic drug that they use in their rituals to assist in opening their third eye.  

Everything in the US is structured to make sure we never reach this state.  

Lust, Men are taught that the more women they have sex with the cooler they are. Women are taught that OnlyFans is empowering. Porn is also free and sex is in all media.  

Envy, we are taught to envy the rich. Their expensive homes, their fast cars, designer clothes, and exotic trips. 

Wrath, we are taught to hate each other for one reason or another whether it be for race, religion, sex, political beliefs, etc.  

Pride, we are taught to take pride in our nation to the point of ignorance and blind belief in authority. 

Gluttony, we are overfed as Americans which is why we have such a high rate of obesity. Our food is also tainted with ingredients that hinder our chances of reaching this state. Eat kosher foods, the tiny hats that are hiding this information would not do this to their own people.

Sloth, we are fed sites like Tik Tok and social media where we spend more time doom scrolling than we do exercising or attempting to build a better life for ourselves. 

Greed, we are taught to look out after ourselves only. We are made to believe in the scarcity mindset, where there aren't enough resources to go around so we keep more for ourselves and never share.  We take more than we need and even at the cost of others.

You must also feel authentic compassion towards others. The point is to open your heart. The saying ""Heart of gold"" did not come from nowhere. Scientists found that there are more pathways sending signals from the heart to the brain than from the brain to the heart. There is a reason the heart was considered the most important part of your body in ancient times. 

Once it makes it to the top of our spine into the pineal gland it stays there for a few days. Jesus was resurrected on the third day. On the third day it drops down back to the base of our spine.  

Congratulations you are now a god. You can manipulate reality around you and even read minds of others. Your mind will exist on a higher plane than this 3 dimensional one so you can access other objects that are on that plane though unconsciously, including other people's minds. You will retain your memory after death because this body is temporary, but your mind has now accessed a higher plane of existence. You will be born in a new body after some time of void and darkness, but you will keep all the memories of your past life. You are now also immortal.  

I believe they may have possibly left some information out, but this is the truth that I know so far. You may have to wait until the full moon passes through your zodiac sign. You also might have to do the Wim Hoff miracle breathing technique regularly while meditating on your chakras. And they may have left out important information about Venus, but I am not sure.  ",0,1770164540.0,confessions,10,0.43,False
1qv99e5,https://www.reddit.com/r/RegentCruises/comments/1qv99e5/grandeur_wonderful_experience_panama_to_la/,Grandeur -Wonderful experience Panama to LA,"I just wanted to take a moment to review this sailing and Regent Seven Seas.  A little background.  I am in my late 50’s, and I have been on over 65 cruises.  Mostly with Royal Caribbean since we had children; Celebrity and Viking when sailing with my spouse or friends.

I really wanted to try the ultra-luxury lines to see what they had to offer versus Celebrity and Viking.  I had status matched to Vs 500 on  Silver Sea through my status on Royal Caribbean, however, they have recently changed their pricing structure and excursions are no longer free if you do not book the all-inclusive fares.

We researched both Regent Seven Seas and Silver Sea and decided to book with Regent for this trip. 

We flew into Panama City, Panama on Wednesday, January 14, 2026.  A note about Panama - they do have a separate immigration/customs line for Seafaring passengers which bypasses the normal line. We Ubered to Old Town where we had an AirBnb right on the square.  We explored the area that night and the next day before going to the ship.  I would recommend Panama, it was a very nice start to the trip.

We hopped into an Uber and went off to the port.  There are a few things to do at the port itself including a museum and a very flat ocean walkway.

 **First impressions**

First thing I noticed heading to the port, there were no other cars or people other than the port employees who whisked our bags off and we were directed to the check-in staff.  Once again, no lines.  It was the calmest, most refreshing embarkation.  We later met some B2B guests that just came through the Panama Canal crossing so not 100% of the guests were embarking that day, but even if 100% of the guests had been arriving that day, it would have been very efficient as they had many available representatives to check everyone in.  

We stepped onto the ship greeted by very friendly staffmembers offering glasses of champagne. What a great start.

We had lunch in the La Veranda Restaurant where we all enjoyed our lunch from the buffet.  This meal was where I first noticed the service was far superior to any other cruise line.  The staff checked on you to see if you needed anything.  I witnessed managers helping bring plates to the tables for guests.  

During our lunch, we met Jorge, the Manager of Regent’s Compass Rose restaurant.  He was so nice and throughout our trip, always stopped and talked to us, as well as many, many other guests. Such a nice man and you can certainly tell he wants the guests to have the best experience possible.

We finished our meal and explored the ship.  It is a remarkable ship.  The colors were subtle browns and tans with crystal accents, and it was very bright.  The artworkand design was beautiful .  

We finished our tour and went to our rooms.  We were in Concierge Staterooms midship and in a perfect location on Deck 8.  We were able to take the steps up and down to the different venues very easily.  Luggage mats were on our beds and our luggage was there waiting for us. There was ample drawer space and a walk-in closet. My sister or I could get ready in the morning without disturbing each other.  Our balcony was very large and had a full-size table and chairs.  The welcome bottle of champagne was popped, and we enjoyed it during sail away. The beds were so comfortable and the sheets were fantastic. Our room attendant met us and gave us instructions on the lights, the mini bar, laundry valet and any other special requests we needed fulfilled.

**Dining**

  
Overall, the dining experience was excellent.  Compared to other lines, Regent always had high-end proteins and a wide selection of sides.  The La Veranda always had a special of the day for breakfast and lunch as well as other choices on the buffet.  We did not go hungry.  We ate in all the restaurants, and enjoyed all of them. Enough reviews have been written on the restaurants and food but all the food was excellent.   Sunday Brunch was not to be missed!

Drinks were plentiful and top-shelf liquor is served. They had water fill stations, coffee stations and flavored water in many places on the ship.  The Meridian had a great menu of specialty cocktails that were handcrafted to perfection.  Afternoon tea everyday had a different theme and was not to be missed. Incredible desserts and finger sandwicheswere both beautiful and delicious.

 **Excursions**

The Destination desk was wonderful, and the team made everything very seamless.

They did offer quite a few excursions for all levels of fitness and activity. My sister and I did a hike through the rainforest and loved it.  A favorite excursion of my other sisters was the safari, where giraffes, donkeys, and other animals ate out of everyone’s hands.  We all loved taking the excursion of riding horses in Cabo San Lucas.

**Staff**

The staff was beyond incredible.  The officers were always visible, and the General Manager’s door was always open.  Every staff member, from the housekeepers to the officers, greeted you when they saw you in the hall or a venue or shoreside.  The staff was friendly, outgoing and happy.  I cannot say enough good things about them.  This is truly where Regent shines!  Of all my cruises this was the best all-around staff!

**Passengers and Activities**

The demographics were much different than what I am used to.  There were no children, or large groups of passengers travelling together.  It made for a very calming and relaxing trip. We met  so many different people from across the US, Europe, Mexico, and Australia. Regent does a great job of scheduling activities that allow you to mingle with other passengers.  They had various games to collect Regent Rewards, trivia, and craft activities that allowed passengers to mingle.  We also had a group of Pickleballers.

We had some great shows that the entertainment team performed flawlessly.  They also brought in 2 guest entertainers that were wonderful. They had guest lecturers that were very informative.  We also had a syndicated Travel Radio show host broadcasting.

  
**Final thoughts**

All I can say is WOW.  As I get older and travel without my kids, I am looking for more of a luxury experience and Regent certainly fits the bill.  This was truly a relaxing experience that was wonderful.  There was not one thing I could complain about.

The staff, the food, the entertainment, the activities, the excursions, the ship were all top notch.  I am looking forward to sailing on Regent soon.  For anyone on the fence about switching cruise lines and moving up to Regent, do not hesitate and book it.  You will not be disappointed.

1qv98um,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1qv98um/i_think_my_husband_is_keeping_something_from_me/,"I think my husband is keeping something from me, WSID","Apologies in advance, this is a lil long and I have ADHD so please bear with me.

So I have to start this off with a little backstory of our relationship. My husband Ryan (31m) and I (30f) have been together for 9 years. We broke up for about 6 months right before we hit our one year mark because he wanted to move out of state and I didn’t. Eventually we worked things out and I left everything I’d ever known and loved to move to a new state with Ryan and his two best friends since high school. This was a big deal to me as I am VERY close with my family and friends. A few months into me moving, I noticed Ryan’s username popped up under a girls Instagram picture. Taken from below, thong bikini so far up her ass it looked painful, full booty cheeks. That was the photo. Booty cheeks. So obviously I had to do a little digging and found plenty more thirst traps he had liked. Some women he didn’t know, some he said were “friends”, and some he knew from previous midnight excursions, if you know what I mean. We had a conversation, and that was the end of that.

A few weeks go by, and I was home alone and decided to get some cleaning done. Living with three men in their early twenties, it was a big job. As I tossed the mountain of trash from the coffee table, I noticed a phone underneath it all. I swear I almost heard it whisper my name. It was Ryan’s old phone, he had just gotten a new one a few weeks ago.

Now this is the part I’m not very proud of. I plugged that sucker in and stared at the screen until the Apple logo lit up and I went to town. I went through everything (he never logged out). Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, messenger. Something took over me and I think I blacked out. In the end I found he had not only been liking many many inappropriate things online, he was also still talking to his ex girlfriend from time to time. She called him on his birthday at 4am while I was fighting my way through airports trying to make it home in time to spend his day with him. She begged him to call her while he was at work multiple times. He did. She told him she’ll always love him. Conveniently his response texts were no where to be found though. The crazy part is, I had seen this girl before. Her and Ryan talked on Twitter, right in front of my face, the whole time I’d known him. I hadn’t known up until this point that she was the ex.

I sat on what I knew for a few weeks. I didn’t know how to face it. I had just moved my whole life across the country to start a life with this man and now I’m just sad and embarrassed. We ended up having a very long conversation. I’m very stern on if you make a mess, clean it up. I was not and will never be his mother so he needs to figure out how to fix this or I’m done. He groveled for a while, deleted all social media, and the last 8 years have been magical. We got married, traveled the country, and finally settled down for a little bit.

Now to present day. Last week I noticed a Snapchat notification on my husband’s phone while he was laying asleep next to me. I felt the same pang in my stomach that I felt all those years ago. I didn’t look to see who it was, I didn’t want to. I also vowed to never go through his phone without his permission ever again after the first time and I meant it. But now I’m at a crossroads. I want to ask him about it, but it’s one of those things that was dealt with so long ago, I don’t want to bring it up. I have very bad anxiety and it was a personal struggle of mine for a long time to be able to trust him again. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is, it’s not him having social media that’s the problem, but why wouldn’t he tell me? Even if he were to add me, I’d consider that letting me know, but we’re not even friends on the platform. This would actually break our marriage completely if I find out he’s doing things behind my back again so I’m trying to figure this out with as much grace as I can. Or am I overreacting?

1qv98l7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qv98l7,Vanilla Flavored Flaxseed Cookies,"Lately, I've been craving a snack with my afternoon coffee, so I decided to make some cookies, specifically, **VANILLA-FLAVORED FLAXSEED COOKIES**. For this, I decided to use some of the flaxseed I had at home. I usually use both chia and flaxseed as egg substitutes, and I grind them shortly before using them to avoid a bitter taste. However, today I decided to use whole flaxseeds, without grinding them.

  
Homemade cookies are healthier because they have natural ingredients, and they're also more economical. I generally like my cookies very toasted (as you can see in the photos), so I bake them until they're nice and crispy, but this is optional. If you prefer them less toasted, just bake them for a shorter time. That said, let's get to my recipe.



# THE RECIPE

  
**Time, ingredients and equipment**



* Preparation time: The recipe requires approximately 40 minutes, of which 20 to 30 minutes will be for baking the cookies (this varies depending on the oven).
* Servings: 40 cookies of varying sizes. The total weight is approximately 180 grams of cookies.

**The quantities of ingredients listed below can be varied according to availability and personal preference. Be creative!**

* 150 grams of wheat flour. I used self-rising flour, but all-purpose flour will also work.
* 80 grams of white sugar.
* 2 flax eggs (2 tablespoons of flaxseeds + 7 tablespoons of very hot water).
* 50 ml of neutral-flavored oil. I used corn oil (you can use whatever you have at home).
* 1 pinch of salt.
* 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
* Baking tray, parchment paper, rolling pin, spoon, bowl, teaspoon, cookie cutters, plates, measuring cup, etc.

  
**THE PROCEDURE**

  
Prepare the flax eggs (add hot water to the flax seeds and let them soak for 20 minutes). Place the flour in a bowl, add the salt and sugar, mix, and then add the oil.

  
Using a fork, mix the dry ingredients with the oil until you get a sandy texture, as shown in the photo. Next, add the vanilla extract to the flax eggs and mix. Add the flax eggs to the flour and oil mixture. Knead until combined and you have a smooth, manageable dough.



Divide the dough in two and roll each piece out with a rolling pin until it's about 3 or 4 millimeters thick. Then, using cookie cutters, cut out the cookies. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper (you can also grease and flour the baking sheet). Bake in a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for about 20 minutes (I baked mine for 30 minutes because I like them nice and toasted).

  
After this time, remove from the oven and let cool before unmolding. And there you have it, my **VANILLA FLAVORED FLAXSEED COOKIES**, which turned out DELICIOUS AND CRUNCHY. They can be stored in an airtight jar or container.

## Market Context

The broader market exhibited downside pressure on February 3, 2026, with the S&P 500 declining 0.97%, the Nasdaq dropping 1.74%, and the Dow Jones falling 0.24%. This bearish trend signals waning risk appetite among investors, potentially challenging SMA20/SMA50 crossover strategies that rely on sustained momentum. In a risk-off environment, short-term moving average signals may generate more false positives or whipsaws, as downward drifts can delay bullish crossovers or accelerate bearish ones, reducing overall reliability for trend-following trades.

Elevated volatility, reflected in the VIX surging 11.08% to 17.95, amplifies intraday swings and heightens the risk of erratic price action. For SMA20/SMA50 signals, this means crossovers could be disrupted by noise, leading to premature entries or exits. Traders should approach these signals cautiously, prioritizing confirmation from higher timeframes to filter out volatility-induced reversals.

With 29 total signals and Healthcare leading as the top sector, current conditions suggest potential sector rotation toward defensives amid the market pullback. Healthcare's relative strength could bolster SMA signals in this area, offering a haven as investors shift from high-beta sectors like those driving Nasdaq weakness, though broad volatility warrants tighter risk management across all signals.

## Vlad's Take (EverHint)

**Today's signals:** Strong sector concentration in Healthcare (7 signals) suggests sector-specific rotation. 9 signals showing insider selling warrant caution. Average RSI of 38 indicates oversold conditions.

1qv94zu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AltBeautyHub/comments/1qv94zu/finally_perfected_that_90s_alt_grunge_look_ive/,"Finally perfected that '90s alt grunge look I've been dreaming of: a messy, smudged eyeliner achieved with just a cheap pencil and a fluffy brush 🖤 (Inspo from an old Hole music video)","You know that feeling when you scroll through incredible alt makeup looks – all dramatic shadows, sharp lines, and intricate artistry – and think, ""Okay, but how do I *actually* wear that to grab coffee without looking like I'm still recovering from a particularly intense poetry slam?"" Yeah, me too.

Lately, I've been wrestling with how to take a bit of that moody, **literary gothic** meets **'90s alt** vibe and make it, well, *less* intimidating for a Tuesday afternoon. My goal wasn't flawless perfection, but a softened, wearable take on a dark eye and a stained lip that still felt authentic to those aesthetics. It was definitely a process of trial and error, but I landed on something I genuinely like.

Here's the breakdown of one of my recent experiments:

**The ""Subtle Smudge & Stain"" Look**

*   **Aesthetic Inspiration:** A faded photograph of a '90s poet, a touch of dark academia, the kind of quiet intensity of a forgotten book. Definitely leaning into a softer **literary gothic** and a more relaxed **'90s alt** feel.
*   **Goal:** A diffused, slightly smudged eye that hints at depth without being heavy, paired with a blotted, berry-stained lip.
*   **Time Invested:** Around 15-20 minutes once I got the hang of it. The initial attempts took longer, mostly staring at myself and asking, ""Too much? Not enough?""
*   **Key Products & Techniques:**
    *   **Eyes:**
        *   **e.l.f. Cosmetics Bite-Size Eyeshadow Palette in ""Berry Bad""** (around $3): I used the deep matte plum shade. Applied it gently along my upper and lower lash lines with a small, flat brush, then softly diffused the edges with a clean fluffy brush. The key here was *not* to take it too high or too far out.
        *   **NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil in ""Black Bean""** (around $5): Just a tiny bit on the upper waterline and very lightly smudged into the outer corner of the upper lash line. This adds a subtle intensity without looking harsh.
        *   **Essence Lash Princess Sculpted Volume Mascara** (around $5): One coat, focused on the roots to add definition without making lashes look too ""done.""
    *   **Lips:**
        *   **Wet N Wild MegaLast Liquid Catsuit Matte Lipstick in ""Plum This Show""** (around $5): This is a beautiful deep berry. I applied a small dot to the center of my upper and lower lips, pressed my lips together, and then blotted *heavily* with a tissue until it looked like a diffused, lived-in stain rather than a perfect application.
    *   **Face:**
        *   Kept it super minimal – just my usual lightweight base and a touch of concealer where needed. No heavy contouring or blush, to let the eyes and lips take center stage.
*   **Budget:** The entire look could probably be replicated for under $20 if you're starting from scratch, using drugstore gems.

**Real Talk: The Journey to ""Just Right""**

Let me tell you, this wasn't an instant success. My first go with the dark plum shadow was far too heavy, giving me more ""recovering from an all-night vampire rave"" than ""contemplative alt aesthetic."" I learned quickly that for a wearable daytime version, *less is always more* with dark colors. Blending is your absolute best friend. I also accidentally smudged the liner too far down on my lower lash line, which made me look perpetually tired instead of mysteriously chic.

The lip was another adventure. Initially, I applied the liquid lipstick directly, and while gorgeous, it was just too intense and opaque for the ""stained"" vibe I was going for. Blotting became my mantra. It took a few attempts to get that perfectly imperfect, blotted-out finish that truly felt **'90s alt** and not just ""I put on lipstick without a mirror.""

What surprised me most was how much impact a truly subtle smudged liner and a strategically blotted dark lip can have. It feels effortlessly cool and a little bit mysterious without screaming for attention. It's a look that feels more about expressing a mood than following a trend, which is exactly what I love about alt beauty.

Playing my heart, messing my mind  
Every day she passes by

“Hey babe,” I say, with a nervous grin  
She smiles, and I think I’m in  
Red lips shining, whiskey eyes  
She talks like thunder in summer skies  
I buy her a drink, we toast and begin  
The music fades when she leans in  
We talk, we laugh, the night moves on

One stolen kiss, just enough to burn  
Leaves me aching for her return

Outside her door, the night turns cold  
Her eyes go distant, I feel bold

“I should’ve known today to just give it a break. So, woke up this morning, got up early to go to the gym, and as yall saw I walked out the door to go to the car and I literally thought, wow I finally have a clear path to my car because there wasn’t any ice \*hand gestures\* that I thought umm literally had that thought for a split moment. I had my cup in my hand, my purse, and then my coffee. There was like a sliver of ice like this big \*hand gestures\* fell, busted my knee, got to my car. My car, first of all, I already changed the battery in it but the key has been saying for me to replace the key battery for like a month now. So got to my car, wouldn’t unlock, waited there in pain, got in the car finally \*loud sigh\* and I was like dang my knee hurts but I still waited yanno. Then I looked at it. It was bleeding. Ummmm so then I ran back inside to get a bandaid. \*keeps licking teeth\* Went back. Got to the gym. Ran into the gym. And I was like yanno what I’m gonna get this over with, knock it out, put my stuff down, forgot my AirPods in my car. Ran back out to the car to get my AirPods. Ummmm. Then everything was great. Yanno. Everything was going fine. Uhh. Actually I was so thankful that my AirPods because the other day, I found my whole thing like the actual pod itself in the dog bowl of water. Almost had like my first mental breakdown in a while. \*deep inhale\* So I put it immediately like in rice. I didn’t know if that worked the same as phones. I guess it does. So. It worked. That was great. And it ended up being Indigo. Indigo I asked him about it and he was like “no that wasn’t me that wasn’t me” and then I was like “Indigo. Bro. They’re not gonna work” and he was like “ha ha it was me”. But. They work. Ummm. Came back. Oh I had to go to the post office to grab stuff for to record for brands. And I gave myself like a time slot between I think it was like 11:30 and 2:30 to get my stuff done. It ended up, I have like, two of them didn’t come in the mail. But. \*long pause\* \*waves hands\* long story short, it took me three hours almost just to record for three brands because they were more like hefty ads not just like just one and done. Like I actually had to like cook and then I had to do other stuff. But I should’ve known. I really should’ve known. And I was also wondering too today, I was like why does my back feel broken all day long? And I thought it was like the ab machine I did yesterday.

I followed it *almost* to a T, the dough seemed too flour-y at first but turned out, was a great texture and tasted pretty good! but once baked they went kind of flat, and honestly they have like no taste? It's very weird. not sure if I needed more salt, but the only change was I did add just a little more than a pinch because ""a pinch"" seemed really low considering how much flour and sugar. im a beginner baker though and don't know a ton! 

the texture isn't bad, a little light (I like a crisp outside and chewy inside, and they're almost more airy like a cookie-cake crossover)

ingredients   
  
2 1/4 cups all purpose flour   
1/4 tsp baking soda  
1/2 tsp baking powder

1 tbsp vanilla bean paste  
1 cup semi sweet chocolate chips

**Title:** Do the Brain Right – The Song That Actually Made Me Rethink How I Use My Mind  

**Post:**  
Alright, this might sound a little different from your usual ""side hustle"" post, but stick with me.  

Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about how our *minds* actually shape the work we do online. So many of us here grind away at gigs, freelancing, affiliate links, and endless “make-money” methods—but how often do we train the one tool that powers it all… our brain?  

Then I stumbled across this piece called **“Do the Brain Right Song”** on [https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song](https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song).  

I didn’t expect much, honestly. But the message hit me. It’s not about motivation clichés—it’s about alignment. The rhythm and flow kind of *wake you up* to the fact that your attitude and thought habits are literally the engine behind how much you earn, create, or even *believe you can*.  

It reminded me that success in online jobs isn’t only about tricks and platforms; it’s about *mental wiring*. When you “do the brain right,” everything else—discipline, focus, creativity—starts falling in line.  

If you’ve ever felt stuck, I highly recommend giving it a watch/listen right here:  
👉 [https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song](https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song)  

And yeah, I went through it twice before it clicked—but once it did, I honestly had this quiet moment of *“Wow… I’ve been treating my mind like hardware, when it’s really the whole operating system.”*  

So, if your hustle needs a mindset refresh this week, take five minutes, grab your coffee, and check out [https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song](https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song).  
Would love to hear your honest thoughts—did it shift your perspective, too?

1qv8zkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1qv8zkb/aita_for_transferring_my_entire_business_to_my/,AITA for transferring my entire business to my son after my daughter called me 'a loser' at her in-laws' dinner table and nobody corrected her?,"My daughter looked me dead in the eye at her husband's family dinner and said, ""Honestly, compared to them, you're kind of a loser."" The table went quiet. Her mother-in-law was holding a wine glass halfway to her lips. Nobody corrected her.

I didn't say a word. I just put my fork down, wiped my mouth with the napkin, and left.

That was three weeks ago. And now she's blowing up my phone every single day begging me to undo what I did next.

So let me tell you what happened, because I need to know if I went too far.

I built my business from nothing. I mean nothing. Fifteen years of my life, every cent I had, every weekend I missed, every fight it caused with the people closest to me. It's a mid-size distribution company. Nothing flashy. But it's real. It pays real salaries. It kept my family fed when nobody else was going to.

Two years ago, my daughter asked if she could come work for me. She had just moved in with her husband, and his family, well, they're loaded. Old money. The kind of family that has a last name people recognize. She wanted something to do during the day while her husband worked, and I thought, sure. I gave her a VP title. Real responsibilities. I even restructured a whole department around her so she could grow into it.

At first it was fine. She showed up. She tried. But then something shifted.

It started small. She stopped returning emails from our team leads. She started showing up late. Not a little late. Like, two hours late, still wearing what she had on from some brunch with her husband's mother. And when people brought it up, she'd get this look on her face. Like the problem was them, not her.

I let it slide for a while because I wanted to give her the chance. But then she started talking.

Not to me. To the staff. Little comments. ""This company would be nothing without someone like my husband's family behind it,"" she said to one of our warehouse managers one afternoon. He told me about it the next day. I didn't bring it up with her. I just watched.

Then came the dinner.

Her husband's parents have this thing where they host a big monthly dinner at their house. I've been going for about a year and a half. Their house is one of those places where everything is too clean and too quiet and you're afraid to touch anything. I usually sit, eat, say thank you, and leave.

That night, her father-in-law was talking about investments. Something about real estate or a fund, I don't really remember. And my daughter, who was sitting right across from me, turned to his mother and said it. Clear as anything. ""Honestly, compared to them, you're kind of a loser."" She was talking about me. To his mother. At their table.

I remember staring at the side of her face. She didn't even flinch.

Her husband, who was sitting right next to her, just looked down at his plate. His parents didn't say anything either. Nobody did. The whole table just sat there like she had said something normal.

I didn't raise my voice. I didn't make a scene. I put my fork down, folded my napkin, and I said, ""Thank you for dinner."" And I left.

I drove home and sat in my car in the driveway for about twenty minutes. My hands were shaking. Not because I was angry, which, okay, I was. But because I realized something. This wasn't new. This had been building for months. And everyone around me had been watching it happen.

That same night, around 11, I called my lawyer.

I didn't sleep that night. But by the next morning, I had a plan, and it was already moving.

The business has two people who can run it. Me and my son. My son has been with the company for four years. He doesn't talk much, doesn't need recognition. He just does the work. He knows every client, every supplier, every number. He's more ready than my daughter ever was, and I should have seen that a long time ago.

Three days after that dinner, I sat my son down and told him everything. Not just about the dinner. About the emails he hadn't seen her ignore, the comments she'd been making, all of it. He listened without interrupting. When I finished, I told him I wanted to transfer majority ownership to him. Formally. On paper.

He looked at me for a second and said, ""Are you sure?""

I said yes.

He nodded and said, ""Okay. What do you need me to sign?""

That was it. No drama. No big moment. Just my son doing what he always does, which is showing up.

The paperwork took about a week. By the time it was done, my daughter still had no idea.

She found out on a Tuesday.

I don't know exactly how. Maybe someone at the office said something. Maybe she checked something she still had access to. But I got a call from her at 2 in the afternoon, and she was screaming before I even said hello.

""What did you do? What the hell did you do? You gave it to HIM? You actually did it?""

I told her calmly that yes, the transfer was done. She went from screaming to crying in about four seconds. She kept saying, ""You can't do this, you can't just do this to me."" And I said, ""You told me, in front of everyone, that I was a loser. I heard you. Everyone heard you. And I believed you were right about one thing, which is that this business deserves to be in better hands.""

She hung up on me.

Over the next week, she called twelve times. I answered twice. The first time she tried to argue. Said I was overreacting. Said it was just a joke. I told her I didn't laugh, and neither did anyone at that table.

The second time she called, she cried. She said she was sorry. She said she didn't mean it. She asked if she could come back to work. I told her no. Her position had already been restructured, and honestly, looking back at her performance, there was no position to come back to anyway. She didn't like hearing that.

Then she showed up at my house.

It was a Saturday morning. I was having coffee on the back porch. She came around the side of the house with her sunglasses on like she'd been crying, and she sat down across from me without asking. She said, ""Mom, please. I'm begging you. Just talk to me.""

I looked at her for a long time. And I said, ""I'll talk to you. But first, tell me why you said it.""

She didn't have an answer. She just kept saying, ""I don't know, I don't know, I was just, I don't know.""

And I said, ""That's the problem.""

Then I told her what was next.

The business transfer was final. That was done. But I also told her that I had already spoken to my son about the company's charitable giving budget, and that we were redirecting a portion of it toward a local program. Nothing to do with her. Just something that mattered to me.

But what I also told her was this, I wasn't going to pretend this didn't happen. Not to her husband's family. Not to anyone. If anyone in that family ever asked me directly why I pulled back, I would tell them the truth. Every word of it. Because I spent fifteen years building something real, and I wasn't going to sit at someone's dinner table and pretend I didn't hear my own daughter call me worthless.

She stared at me. Her face went completely white.

""You wouldn't,"" she said.

""Watch me,"" I said. And I meant it.

She left without saying goodbye.

It's been almost two weeks since then. She texted me once. Just said, ""I'm sorry."" I read it. I didn't respond. Not because I'm trying to be cruel. But because sorry doesn't change what she said. And it doesn't change what it told me about who she's become.

My son called me yesterday to check in. He asked if I was okay. I told him I was fine. He said, ""She made her choice, and you made yours. That's how it works."" And he's right.

But I keep going back and forth. She's my daughter. I love her. And part of me wonders if I took something too far by cutting her out of the business completely. Maybe I should have just talked to her first. Maybe I should have given her one more chance.

I don't know. AITA?

I’m reaching out to survivors of domestic violence in Ohio, and to the families of those who did not survive, because I want to tell your story.

Not just the relationship.

Not just the abuse.

I want to hear what happened after. I want to hear your experiences with law enforcement, the courts, protection orders, prosecutors, probation or parole, child services, and the moments where the system helped, failed, or disappeared when you needed it most.

I am working on a book that documents the significant increase in domestic-violence-related deaths in Ohio this past year and examines the systemic gaps that allow these outcomes to continue. This book will be a collection of true, short stories, told by the people who lived them.

This is not about sensationalizing trauma.

This is about truth, accountability, and remembering the people behind the statistics.

I am a survivor myself. I understand how difficult it can be to revisit these experiences, especially when so many of us were not believed or protected the first time (or second, or third….). Sharing is completely voluntary, and you are always in control of what you choose to share and what you don’t.

Your identity will be protected if desired. Names will be changed upon request. No story will be published in final form without your review and explicit approval. If at any point you decide not to participate, that decision will be respected without question.

I am specifically seeking Ohio cases only, including both survivors and families who have lost someone to domestic violence.

There is no required format. You don’t need the “right words.” You don’t need to be polished. You don’t need to protect anyone but yourself. I want to hear your truth, no matter how messy that truth is.

If you’re willing to talk, I’m happy to meet in whatever way feels safest and most comfortable for you - over coffee, via FaceTime, by phone, text, or email. We can go at your pace.

If the system failed you, I want that documented.

If it helped in ways no one talks about, I want that included too.

If you are interested in sharing your story, please message me privately. I will respond personally.

This book is being written because domestic violence deaths in Ohio are rising — and because too many failures remain invisible when survivors and families are not given space to speak.

1qv8wxv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qv8wxv,Great Grandmother's Lemon Squares,"I uncovered my great grandmother's recipe collection and I've finally decided to go through them. This was the first hand written recipe of hers I uncovered. 

The recipe reads: 

lemon squares

Crust:

1 c. butter

1/2 c. powdered sugar

2 c. flour

Pinch of salt

Cut butter or margarine, flour and salt together and pat evenly into 9""x13"" inch pan. (It should be only about 1/2 inch thick when completed, so don't bother to work the dough all up the sides). Bake at 350° for 20 minutes.

Filling:

4 eggs beaten

6 T. flour

2 c. sugar

6 T. lemon juice

Grated rind of 2 lemons.

Mix and pour over crust and bake for 25 more minutes.

Sift powdered sugar all over the top. Makes 3 dozens squares.

If you should make this, cut and place on dish (like cookies or fudge) before serving.

* **have a dedicated workspace.** it doesn’t need to be fancy, just simple asf. have a place where u sit down and *only* work. have ur book out on the right page before u even start.
* **the caffeine nap.** low on energy? drink a coffee, nap for 20 mins immediately. by the time u wake up, the caffeine has kicked in and ur ready for deep work.
* **multitasking is a myth.** one screen, one task. do it for as long as it takes. that’s actual productivity.
* **reclaim ur focus.** honestly, a friend invited me to test the appp FeedLite to remove Reels and Shorts from my feed recently. it’s been a few weeks and the results are pretty positive so far—it’s been huge for my grades bc i’m not losing 30 mins to ""quick breaks"" that turn into doomscrolling loops. i still need to see the long term results, but it makes consistency way easier.
* **music is fine (mostly).** unless ur actively trying to memorise something for the first time. it’s perfect for repetitive stuff like maths practice questions.
* **consistency > everything else.** studying 2 hours every single day is 10x better than pulling an 8-hour marathon once a week.

1qv8ubl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_yeshuaxrpl/comments/1qv8ubl/being_tired_for_reasons_sleep_cant_fix/,Being Tired for Reasons Sleep Can’t Fix,"I love how the day always ends with hope. Like, tonight is the night. I’m going to bed early. I’m going to be responsible. I’ll crash at 10 p.m. sharp, full eight hours, no doomscrolling, no “one last episode.” I’ll wake up refreshed, glowing, reborn. A new person. A person who drinks water and stretches.

Then morning comes. Alarm rings. And my body wakes up, sure, but my soul stays in bed like, no, you go ahead. I feel like I got hit by a truck, but not the dramatic, movie kind. More like the slow, bureaucratic kind. The kind that runs you over, backs up, checks paperwork, then runs you over again just to be sure. Eight hours of sleep. Still tired. Wild. Seriously.

That’s when you realize this isn’t the sleepy tired. This is the other one. The one sleep doesn’t touch. The kind of tired that laughs at melatonin.

Everyone loves to talk about work-life balance. Companies especially. They’ll slap it on posters, email signatures, maybe a Zoom background. “Wellness Wednesday.” “Mental Health Matters.” Free yoga once a quarter, but only during lunch break, and please be back on time. Meanwhile, the real exhaustion isn’t from staying late. It’s from smiling at a boss who drains the room the moment they open their mouth. It’s from nodding in meetings that could’ve been an email, but weren’t, because apparently everyone needed to “align.” Align to what, exactly? Our shared confusion?

You spend the whole day pretending to care at a level that deserves an Oscar. You throw in a “Sounds good!” and a thumbs-up emoji like it costs nothing. It costs something. It costs battery. Emotional battery. And yours has been stuck at 3% since February.

Monday emails hit different. You open your inbox and feel your stomach drop, even if nothing bad is there. It’s just the anticipation. The “what fresh nonsense is waiting for me today” feeling. Team chats light up with “Good morning, team! Let’s crush it!” and you reply “Good morning!” because that’s what functional adults do, but inside you’re already planning your escape to a life where emails don’t exist and mornings are just mornings.

You come home and there’s another shift waiting. Family wants stories. Kids want energy. Roommates want conversation. Someone asks, “How was your day?” and you do the math. Do I give the real answer, or the short one that keeps the peace? You choose the short one. “I’m fine.” Classic. Polite, efficient lying.

Then you scroll. Because of course you do. And suddenly everyone else is thriving. New job. New business. New body. New beach. Smiling faces, soft lighting, captions about gratitude. Meanwhile your highlight reel didn’t load. Probably deleted. You start wondering if you missed a life update where everyone else figured it out and you were in the bathroom when it happened.

They say sleep is the best medicine. Yeah, tell that to the anxiety that wakes up before your alarm. Must be nice if problems could just sleep peacefully. I’ve had full ten-hour sleeps and still felt like I needed another vacation, not from work, but from my own head. My body’s rested. My thoughts are not. They’re running laps at 4 a.m. like they’re training for something.

I’m not innocent here. I’m the guy who says “I’m fine” like it’s a personality trait. I’m the genius who thinks one more coffee can fix an existential crisis. I’ve looked at my calendar, seen it packed wall to wall, and said, “I can handle it.” Then wondered later why everything feels heavy. I thought being tired was just part of being an adult. Like taxes. Or back pain. Or pretending you enjoy small talk.

But there’s a deeper tired that sneaks up on you. The tired from carrying things you never talk about. The regrets you keep folded neatly in the back of your mind. The plans you postponed so long they quietly expired. The pressure to be resilient, to be resourceful, to push through. We love those words. Endure. Hustle. Grind. They sound strong. They don’t ask follow-up questions.

No one really asks how you’re holding up. They ask if you’re busy. As if busy automatically means okay. As if productivity is proof of wellness. So you translate your feelings into something acceptable. You don’t say, “I’m exhausted in a way that scares me.” You say, “Just a bit tired.” You make it smaller so it fits the room.

And that translation is tiring. Constantly editing yourself. Adjusting tone. Making sure you’re not “too much.” Laughing at jokes you don’t find funny because it’s easier than explaining why you’re quiet today. You start to forget what unedited feels like.

The wild part is, from the outside, everything looks fine. You show up. You deliver. You function. So even you start doubting yourself. You think, maybe I’m just weak. Maybe everyone feels this and I’m just bad at handling it. So you double down. You push harder. You add another layer of pretending on top of the old one.

Until even the pretending gets heavy.

That’s the moment that scares you a little. When rest doesn’t help. When weekends disappear too fast. When Sunday night feels like a countdown instead of a break. When you’re not even sad exactly, just numb and tired and weirdly angry at nothing in particular.

No inspirational quote fixes that. No “just be grateful” speech. Sometimes all you can do is notice it. Name it. Admit that this tired has reasons. And those reasons don’t fit neatly into sick leave forms or productivity apps.

Maybe the real problem isn’t how many hours we sleep. Maybe it’s how many hours we spend pretending we’re okay. Smiling through it. Powering through it. Carrying it quietly so we don’t inconvenience anyone. Because you can only run on empty for so long before even the act of pretending starts to feel like work.

And when that happens, you start wondering, half-joking but not really: if rest can’t fix this, and pretending makes it worse, what’s left to put down first?",1,1770163476.0,u_yeshuaxrpl,0,1.0,False
1qv8u15,https://i.redd.it/rj1odzcscdhg1.jpeg,Got it figured out- manual omissions,"E24 is working well now. The unit needed to be primed. The manual only states to prime it before first use and if it hasn’t been used in 2 weeks.

I never ran out of water so not sure why it needed to be primed again. 

The lack of foam was mostly due to using chocolate milk. The manual doesn’t warn against it but maybe it is unusual enough to be an edge case.

Even using whole plain milk I found a few things that the manual doesn’t cover or misleads the operator. After pulling a shot I let the machine sit for a minute or so before trying to steam. Also the manual states to turn the knob “slightly”. I get better results opening it up a full turn. 

As far as online videos go most of the foam is produced in the final few seconds when the SS jug is very hot, too hot to leave my hand against the bottom but it doesn’t burn the milk at this point. Some guides suggested stopping steam when the jug is hot but you have to go a few more seconds imo.

I’m not going to give up on a mocha. I’ll try a different milk and maybe foam white on top of chocolate for fun.

1qv8ttd,https://www.reddit.com/r/NextGenMan/comments/1qv8ttd/i_was_a_nice_guy_for_10_years_and_it_destroyed_my/,"I was a ""nice guy"" for 10 years and it destroyed my dating life. Here's the painful truth no one tells you.","I remember the exact moment I realized being a ""nice guy"" had ruined my dating life.

It was at my friend Jake's wedding. I was sitting at the singles table again watching as the best man gave his speech. This guy was everything I wasn't: loud, sometimes inappropriate, and completely comfortable taking up space. I'd always considered him kind of a jerk.

""Before I met Sarah,"" Jake's best man said, gesturing to the bride, ""Jake was the guy who would give you his last dollar, drive you to the airport at 4 AM, and never ask for anything in return.""

I nodded to myself. That described me perfectly. I was the reliable one, the shoulder to cry on, the guy who was always there when you needed something.

""But he was also miserable in relationships until he learned one crucial lesson,"" the best man continued. ""Being kind is meaningless if you don't respect yourself first.""

Something clicked in that moment. I'd spent years believing that my niceness was a virtue that by being accommodating, agreeable, and putting everyone else's needs before my own, I was doing dating right. But looking around at my perpetually single life compared to Jake's obvious happiness, I had to confront an uncomfortable truth: my ""nice guy"" behavior wasn't actually nice at all. It was a covert contract with the world that wasn't paying off.

The next morning, I had coffee with Jake before he left for his honeymoon. Against my better judgment, I asked him what changed for him.

""I realized I was being nice because I was terrified of conflict,"" he said bluntly. ""I wasn't being kind. I was being conflict-avoidant. There's a massive difference.""

He explained that he used to do the same things I did: agree with everything women said even when he didn't, never express his own needs, act as an emotional support system for women he was interested in without ever making a move. He'd been the quintessential ""nice guy.""

""The problem is, it's manipulative,"" he continued, seeing the confusion on my face. ""You're not being honest about what you want. You're doing favors and being agreeable hoping it will make someone love you. That's not how attraction works.""

I felt defensive at first. How was being kind manipulative? But as Jake spoke, I recognized myself in every example. The time I helped a woman I had a crush on move apartments, spending 12 hours lifting furniture while she told me about the guy she was actually interested in. The countless coffee ""dates"" where I listened to women's problems without ever expressing my romantic interest. The relationships where I'd become a doormat, saying yes to everything, then growing resentful when they lost respect for me.

I wasn't being nice. I was trading favors and agreeableness for affection that never came.

After that conversation, I spent months reflecting on how my ""nice guy"" behavior had shaped my interactions with women. I realized several painful truths:

I wasn't actually being authentic. I was suppressing my real opinions, needs, and desires to appear agreeable.

I wasn't giving women the opportunity to know the real me. Just a carefully constructed persona designed to avoid rejection.

Most importantly, I wasn't treating women as equals. I was putting them on pedestals, then feeling betrayed when they didn't reward my niceness with romance or sex.

The hardest part was accepting that my niceness wasn't about being a good person. It was about fear. Fear of rejection, fear of conflict, fear of being seen as ""one of those guys"" who expresses desire directly.

My transformation didn't happen overnight. It started with small acts of authenticity: expressing a different opinion during a date instead of just agreeing, saying no when I didn't want to do something, being honest about my romantic interest early rather than pretending to be ""just a friend"" while secretly hoping for more.

The first time I respectfully disagreed with a woman I was dating about a political issue, I was terrified she'd be upset. Instead, it led to our most engaging conversation yet. She later told me she appreciated that I had my own views rather than just mirroring hers.

When I started setting boundaries around my time and energy (not dropping everything whenever someone called, not being available 24/7 for emotional support without reciprocation), I expected people to disappear from my life. Some did. But the relationships that remained grew stronger, built on mutual respect rather than one-sided servitude.

The most significant change came when I began expressing romantic interest directly rather than trying to ""nice"" my way into someone's heart. Yes, I faced more explicit rejection. But I also experienced more authentic connection. Women responded to my honesty in a way they never had to my calculated niceness.

Six months after Jake's wedding, I met Alison at a friend's dinner party. When she mentioned loving a book I found pretentious, I politely said so rather than falsely agreeing. When she suggested meeting for coffee ""as friends"" after our second date, I gently explained that I was looking for a romantic relationship, not another friendship. When she asked for help moving a week later, I told her I'd rather take her to dinner instead.

Each time I expected my honesty to push her away, but it had the opposite effect. Our relationship developed based on mutual respect and authenticity, something I'd never experienced in my ""nice guy"" days.

The irony of the ""nice guy"" approach is that it's anything but nice. Real kindness comes with boundaries, honesty, and self-respect. It means being generous without expectation, caring without manipulation, supportive without subservience.

I still consider myself a kind person. But I'm no longer a ""nice guy."" I've stopped using agreeableness as a strategy to avoid rejection. I've learned that authentic connection requires authentic behavior even when that means risking disapproval.

If you recognize yourself in my story, know that there's a path forward that doesn't require becoming a jerk. It simply requires becoming real. Women don't reject nice guys. They reject inauthentic men who use niceness to hide their true selves and desires.",2,1770163444.0,NextGenMan,0,1.0,False

I’ve dealt with enough back pain to know that how you sit matters.

I went on a first date with ""Liam"" (29M) last night. We met at a coffee shop. Within five minutes, I noticed Liam was slumped so far down in his chair his chin was basically touching his chest. He was complaining about having a ""killer headache"" and ""chronic shoulder tension.""

being a dev and a fitness nerd, I tried to be helpful. I said, ""Hey, not to be that person, but if you sit up a bit and engage your core, those tension headaches usually clear up. I used to get them too until I fixed my posture.""

Liam rolled his eyes and said, ""I didn't come here for a physical therapy session.""

I dropped it and tried to pivot to talking about hobbies. But every time he moved, he’d wince or rub his neck, then go right back to slouching like a shrimp. Finally, he looked at me and said, ""Can you stop looking at my back? It’s creepy. You're being a total health nut. Just let me live.""

I told him it’s hard to have a conversation with someone who is actively complaining about pain but refusing to do the bare minimum to fix it. He got loud and said I was ""judgemental"" and ""obsessive."" He told me I should be ""nicer"" to people who aren't ""fitness freaks.""

I realized we were totally incompatible. I stood up, paid for my own coffee, and said, ""I think you’d be happier with a date who doesn't mind watching you be miserable. good luck with the neck pain.""

As I left, he texted me saying I ""embarrassed him"" and that I have a ""superiority complex"" just because I work out and sit up straight. My friends think I should have just ignored it and been ""chill,"" but I can't stand seeing someone self-destruct their spine while complaining about it.

According to a recent YouTube poll, the majority of the votes said that too many posts are locked behind a paywall. While it is true that most of our posts are locked by membership, we offer exclusives such as sneak peeks and WIPs as an incentive so people can support the Doraemon fansub project. As the rule of crowdfunding goes, you can't have supporters without incentives. Take one of my favorite content creators, for example, [‪@JadaPada‬](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUGXQiqlqllRAxhJKIGBUEQ), A.K.A. Mr. ""Searching for Sahks Dihk,"" as I call him. He runs a Patreon so that he can fund his projects outside of his TFASD/Dango ARG, and offers sneak peeks and exclusives as membership incentives.

As for the pricing, that is an issue we've only recently learned about. Most of our followers can't afford to support us because of how high our memberships are. So, in response to our high prices, we are slashing the prices of memberships and one-off ""dorayakis"" down to the most affordable prices.

**One-off Dorayakis:** $3

**Memberships:**

* **Tip Jar:** $1
* **Lazy Student:** $3
* **Great-Great-Grandson:** $5
* **RoboCat:** $10
* **DELUXIFIED RoboCat**: $25

These new prices will make it easier for our followers to support the fansub project.

As for the purpose of our page, we use the money from it to hire and find a team to help us on our journey to bring Doraemon to the Anglosphere, one line at a time, along with covering other project-related expenses such as social media marketing and paid plans for Carrd (where we host and create our one-page site) and CapCut (our primary video editor). One of our users on r/DoraeSubs asked a question regarding our new website domain, which we bought with our BMC money, and we informed him of our necessary expenses related to the project. If we went around spending all that money like disposable income, we'd be the Enron or CINAR of anime fansubs. DoraeSubs is strictly a non-profit project.

We hope this gives you a better understanding of our BMC page and what we use the money for.

I know of him professionally because we work in the same industry, but he works at a different company so we've never actually met. I saw his profile on Hinge and realized he is gay. I sent a rose on hinge about two weeks ago but I haven't heard back, which normally I obviously just move on because you don't even really see your ""sent like history"" on hinge. But since I know of him, I can't help but want to hear directly from the horse's mouth and make sure it's not because he simply hasn't logged onto Hinge lately (which is a possibility because he's like early 30s but one of his hinge photo is a picture of him with his family on his college campus, which makes me think he created the profile a while back?)

About a week ago, I also asked a friend that we mutually know and also works at his company to set me up with him, and my friend was definitely open to connecting us, but it's also the busy season for all of us right now so I'm not sure if my friend spoke to him yet. So now I'm thinking I have two options:

1. Follow up with my friend this weekend since it will have been about 2 weeks after I asked him to connect us, and nudge my friend a little bit to talk to the boy I'm interested in. I can say I'm still looking for my valentine so if there's any chance with him still, can you try to talk to him next week and set us up.
2. I'm also thinking of connecting with him on Linkedin and just be like would you want to grab coffee or drinks after work? But not sure if I should say I saw his profile on hinge.

I definitely think this boy is very cute, and I feel like on paper, he and I could be a good fit because we're in the same industry and we understand the pressure, so if I had to work on a Sunday he would totally get it. We even follow some of the same companies/stocks but in slightly different capacities so we'll definitely have a lot to talk about between work and hobbies. So that's why I'm thinking of option 2 on Linkedin as the more ""nuclear option"" because I just really want to shoot my shot and see where it could go. I have no issue if he's not interested and just friend zones me over coffee/drinks, I'll just be like ""see you around at a meeting/conference"" because at least I gave it a shot? In my head, the rejection can't be any worse than staying in the closet all these years.

So should I just follow up with my friend or give Linkedin a shot as well? Or is Linkedin too creepy? If anyone has any advice/suggestions/opinions on what to do here, please let me know! Thanks in advance!!",2,1770162935.0,askgaybros,4,1.0,False

**About me:** I am a master’s student in a demanding STEM field. I would describe myself as an intellectually curious person, and I love to read and learn new things. My intellectual interests are very diverse, ranging from science and economics to history and culture. Whatever excites you in life, I will probably enjoy listening to you share it. While I spend much of my time studying, there is much more to me than a bookworm. I have lived, studied, worked, and travelled widely in Europe, and I always enjoy visiting new places. I’m also a longtime athlete who enjoys many sports and tries to remain active amid a busy schedule. While I am not socially weird or shy, I am not the type to party or go out frequently either. I would prefer to relax with a book and some coffee or share a meal in a peaceful setting. Appearance-wise, I’m white, over 6 feet, and not bad-looking.

**What I’m looking for:** I come into this with *no expectations at all*. I have no intention of putting labels on things early. Being a relatively cerebral person, I connect best with people of a similar disposition. My hope is to find someone with whom I have some chemistry and see how things evolve. If it turns into a relationship, that’s great. If it turns into a friendship, that’s also great. If it turns into nothing at all, that’s perfectly fine!

**About you:** as stated above, I come in with no expectations. I am open to many types of people and I’m not going to filter others aggressively based on superficial characteristics. I’m very flexible on things like age. Ideally you will be a somewhat intellectual person as well, but I know that intelligence comes in many forms and I appreciate them all. Kind people are very attractive to me. Bonus points if you’re a morning person like I am. Please be located in or near Boston.

What my cousin did was the ULTIMATE betrayal of trust!,"For context, I (F24) and my cousin (F25) have been best friends basically since birth. She ended up moving out of state when we were in middle school but we always kept in touch then about 3 years ago she ended up moving back to the state I live and we got a place together with my boyfriend and my sister. My best friend (F27) was able to hook her up with a job and I joined them both not long after that. Things were going good but I’m not going to lie I got jealous that she got to hang out with my best friend everyday and that’s part of the reason I started working with them, to feel more included. Everything was going good for a while until my cousin admitted she had feelings for my best friend…..

They end up dating and I was not happy about it. I pretended to be as supportive as possible because I didn’t want to start any problems but my cousin has been known to date people for short periods of time, she’s never cheated or anything but I was still scared she would do something and ruin the friendship. Well as time passed their relationship started affecting me more and more. I felt like they didn’t want to hang out with me anymore and they would never include me in anything. When my best friend would come by the house they would hang out downstairs for a bit then go upstairs to my cousins room and they never invited me to join them. I started distancing myself to see if they would go out of their way to include me but they never did. So I started making it known I was upset about it, but whenever my cousin would question if I was okay or if she had done something to upset me I always said it was fine because I wasn’t even sure what to say or how I was feeling and didn’t want to deal with the conflict. I would mainly rant to my boyfriend and my sister about it in the shed when smoking or over text whenever something happened in the moment at work or on lunch to piss me off.

Well one day I gave my cousin my phone to order food on lunch and she took a long time but I didn’t think anything of it and she seemed off while we were eating lunch but I couldn’t tell why until she admitted she WENT THROUGH MY PHONE!!! like are you kidding?? That is the ULTIMSTE BETRAYAL!!! She claims she had heard me talking badly about her in the shed on multiple occasions and she never wanted to confront me without proof. She said that whenever she asked me in person if everything was okay I would never tell her so she felt she had to look in my phone for answers/proof. She says she only searched her name to see if I was shit talking but like those are my private messages and she had NO RIGHT WHATSOEVER to go through any of them! 

Now she’s mad at me for the things I said and is trying to play the victim? She told me I was talking shit about her behind her back but really I was just really mad in those little moments, let it out and then never thought about it again. Now she is moving back out of NC and her and my best friend will be breaking up so I got what I wanted anyways. But For context I will include some of the things I said that she had a problem with. Am I over reacting? Am I the asshole? Who is in the right because she’s expecting me to apologize and I feel I am in the right but need to make sure..

Examples of the messages she brought up:

My cousin was staying the night at my best friend’s house and I texted them asking if they wanted to play Fortnite with me and they never responded. The next morning I asked if my best friend wanted Dunkin’ (cousin doesn’t drink coffee) but got through the line before they answered so I sent “NVM” my cousin then replied “sorry we fell asleep watching squid games last night, was the dunkin line too long?” I told her no she just took too long to respond. I sent this screenshot to my Boyfriend and said “they never text me back, and “was the line too long??? Dumb Bitch you guys just didn’t respond” my bf replied “lol I hate them they are always on their phone especially your cousin” I then said “exactly… I just never get a response it’s whatever.. I just have no friends..it makes me not want to talk to them at all. But they are the only people I talk to so I have no choice idk” my bf was supportive of course 

One morning I didn’t start my car because I wanted to catch a ride with my cousin to work and she told me I could ride with her if I wanted but she had to stop at the store on the way home if I was okay with that. This annoyed me because the store is right next to our house?? Like you can’t drop me off first tf? So I told my boyfriend what happened and that she pissed me off and he said she was being a bitch so I figured I was in the right. I told him I’m not taking a lunch with her anyways because I packed mine and she didn’t which is why I didn’t offer to drive. I told him she was being weird and that I hated her and he agreed she was being weird and annoying. 

That’s just two but I can include the entire list that she sent me it just might not have a lot of context.. ",0,1770162829.0,AIO,17,0.2,False

I love chatting about plants and fish. I breed and propagate fish/plants, so I'm always down to trade, too.

I've been drinking a lot of tea and coffee lately. Always like new suggestions for both. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading. I've started making my own breads and want to start making different jelly when it's warm enough for my berry bushes to produce

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Overwatch, Marvel Rivals, Valorant, and Ark Suvival Ascended. Love playing Pokemon games and doing some Pokémon card collecting, too. I've been getting into playing more survival games than shooting games lately. I also built my PC to play on a couple of years ago.

I'm down to chat about any random stuff you like to chat about. Always up to try or learn about new hobbies. ",2,1770162800.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I’ve already passed through the miserable early months of headaches, lethargy and naps. At the 6 month mark went through a dark depressive spiral and a bunch of existential dread (added to by post holiday crash and dark cold weather) which I swiftly recovered from.

I eat well rounded (protein, vegetables, fruits), hit the gym 5-6 days a week, supplement vitamin d in winter, get outside for walks, have a good family life.

I feel just ok. I don't need to nap to get through the day, I sleep well. I feel 'even' but I never feel creative, motivated, surges of joy, excitement. It hits hardest with my job. I can get my job done, but I don't feel like I ever have the spark to go above and beyond.

Curious if anyone who's gone long term, say 1 year or more, saw these kinds of things simply improve with more time? Or, am I just unrealistically expecting myself to return the caffeinated version of me?",6,1770162751.0,decaf,4,1.0,False

She’s 25, and she has honestly had a very hard life, her mom passed (from the same cancer she has now)

And the rest of her family was either abusive, drug addicts or both. So, she has zero contact with any of them. As far as I know she has no friends other than me and a girl we work with.

She’s always very calm, very sweet but also noticeably depressed. She doesn’t seem to care about much, like even before she was sick I’d ask her about her plans and she would tell me she was excited for her weekly grocery shop, like every week she looked forward to that. The only other thing she’s expressed interest in is coffee shops.

I actually asked her out a few times and she said she couldn’t date, the other girl we work with said she’s never even kissed anyone and told me to give up so I did, still wanted to be friends.

Anyways, about a week ago I found out she has cancer. She was diagnosed a month prior to telling anyone.

She casually said it’s stage 2 and treatable, but she wants to go be with her mom so she isn’t taking any treatment. Literally looked at me and said she didn’t have much to live for, no tears in her eyes just kind of shrugged it off like she was telling me she had the flu, told me she was struggling financially and her car is having problems anyways so she thinks this is her way out, I know she’s been having issues with her older brother threatening her for money (drug addict)

She even said maybe her mom was helping her to escape her suffering. she actually seems happier than ever now. And that’s the problem, I see why she feels that way.. but she’s such an amazing person. She’s beautiful inside and out, a good friend to all of us at work, I just hate to see her give up after surviving so much.

I did try to talk to her once, but I approached it wrong I think and she asked me to please not bring it up again. I just said she could become a mom, wife and have a family one day and she said she doesn’t want one. That’s all I could really think of to say.

I know I can’t force her to do anything, but I’m stuck. There’s no one to contact, it’s not even like I can contact a grandparent or sibling. She has no one, no social media, I went on her phone and she has 3 contacts. Me, our coworker and our boss… our coworker (also 25F) suggested we maybe pool tips at work for a few days and offer to help get her car fixed which i actually like the idea, I just think the car is probably only the tip of the ice berg in her brain.

I'm really just terrified to speak in front of my company now (not that big, under 50 people).

I think a big part of it is my frustration that my speaking abilities were really on an upward trajectory. I had been nervous about public speaking in the past, but in this job, I had been doing so much better, confidently voicing thoughts in (smaller) meetings and in front of clients.

Then one day I (somewhat self-inflictingly) committed to leading a meeting on a project I was already NOT feeling confident about. I invited 10+ people from across teams who I'm not used to meeting with. I had drank some insanely strong cold brew. I went in with the attitude of 'I need to prove myself' and 'I need to make them care about this project.' Recipe for disaster right?

I had to stop a few minutes in since my voice was shaking so uncontrollably, my throat was so dry. Went on mute and off camera for like 15 seconds to just breathe. Then, I covered for myself, ""too much coffee, haha..."" and continued on, still rather shaky, but I did finish and ended up having a decent discussion with the people in the virtual room. But man was I so so so embarrassed. I had to give a short presentation to the whole company a few weeks after that, and of course was in my head about it, and was noticeably shaky and nervous all over again. A few people mentioned my nerves in some anonymous peer feedback. Knowing how visible it all was made me feel even worse.

So ever since then, I've felt like a failure, like I'm in my 30s with so much experience under my belt, why is this still a problem for me? But I've also felt frustrated with the aspects of my company/role that led me to feel so insecure. I think there are a lot of legitimate factors that have caused me to feel undervalued at work.

I'm getting through the day to day but can't bring myself to speak up even briefly in team-wide meetings and desperately want to leave my job. I think my instinct there is correct, I should look for another place where I feel more valued (via better title, salary, involvement in more projects). But I also know that's partly wanting to run away from the embarrassment. A part of me knows I need to overcome this hangup, and waiting to get another job isn't the best or most realistic strategy. I know part of the issue IS me and my self confidence.

How do I move on? I am trying to take steps forward and am in general therapy so I've discussed this with some trusted people in my life, which has been helpful. But hoping I can get some anonymous wisdom from the kind folks here, would love to hear anyone's thoughts. Thanks so much!!!!",1,1770162304.0,careerguidance,2,1.0,False

One of them was introduced as a senior coordinator from a “security and institutional liaison” channel, careful to avoid naming ABIN while speaking like someone who had access to information that did not come from newspapers. His suit was ordinary, his language bureaucratic, his hands empty, but he had the habit of someone used to being obeyed without raising his voice. The other was a uniformed official, described as a representative of service leadership, and careful to speak as if he were only discussing contingencies. His presence did not carry menace. It carried certainty.


They did not offer a plan. They offered a premise: the post election week could become ungovernable, and anyone who wanted relevance later needed to choose posture now.

[Hugo Motta](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Motta) received them in an office so plain it could have hosted any meeting about any topic, which was, in its own way, the point. Coffee appeared without ceremony, and he asked who had sent them without truly asking, because in Brasília the question is often less about names than about signals. He listened without interruption as the scenario was laid out in blunt institutional terms: a contested result, judicial enforcement tightening in ways that would be read as provocation, and street demonstrations that could swell once the losing side convinced itself it had been managed rather than defeated. They described it as governability risk, not ideological war, and placed the Chamber where it always sits in emergencies, as the only actor capable of lending extraordinary measures a constitutional narrative that ordinary deputies could repeat without feeling like accomplices. Motta’s questions stayed practical, the kind of questions a politician asks when he is still evaluating whether he is being invited to shape an outcome or being positioned to absorb the backlash. He wanted to know what Congress would be expected to do in public, how quickly it would need to move, and what the executive would say to avoid making the Chamber look like it was acting alone. The emissary answered in a register that sounded cooperative and harmless, as if they were discussing process improvements rather than rupture. He spoke about keeping the Chamber close, about respecting the institution’s protagonism, about avoiding surprises that would force deputies into theatrical resistance. The words were careful, but the effect was reassuring, and reassurance in Brasília often matters more than detail. When Motta asked whether he would still have room to negotiate once the crisis began moving at speed, the liaison did not deny him. He acknowledged the concern, praised Motta’s sense of timing, and stressed that legislative coordination would be decisive in keeping the response bounded and defensible, which sounded like leverage without ever explicitly promising it. 

A detail was introduced midstream, almost as an aside, delivered with the tone of someone protecting Motta rather than restricting him. There were sensitive threads, the emissary said, and partial disclosure at the wrong moment could trigger panic, distort reactions, and force the Chamber to legislate while the streets were already burning. He framed it as a courtesy, a warning offered to help Motta avoid being cornered by incomplete information. Motta absorbed it as professional prudence, not as a sign that he would be kept outside the room. What Motta did not notice was how cleanly the emissary’s language was constructed to feel like access while granting none. Every promise was a noun without a verb, every assurance a process without a point of decision, every warm phrase designed to make him imagine himself in the middle of the sequence while placing him precisely where he could be used without being trusted. Later, in the elevator down, the uniformed liaison murmured that the Chamber president had “the right temperament,” and the emissary answered with a small, satisfied silence that did not belong to partnership. In their private shorthand, Motta was not being recruited as a co author of events, he was being prepared as a stabilizing voice, a man who would move fast and speak confidently because he believed, until the last moment, that he was shaping the agenda. When they left, the impression that lingered was not humiliation or resignation, but a colder confidence. Motta had not been promised control, but he had been treated as necessary, and he walked away believing necessity could be converted into influence once the clock started.

[Davi Alcolumbre](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davi_Alcolumbre) met them later, and the tone shifted, not toward hostility, but toward institutional self awareness. He was cordial, yet his attention stayed narrow and severe, as if he were weighing not opportunities but liabilities. He treated the scenario as a threat to the Senate’s function, the house that formalizes endings and then lives with the consequences while others rewrite their own roles afterward. He listened to the same premise and returned to one concern that mattered more than status: the Senate would not be left holding the pen while everyone else claimed they were merely enforcing normalcy. He asked fewer questions than Motta, but each question landed closer to the bone. If the post election week turned into a legitimacy standoff, would the response remain disciplined enough to keep Congress from being pulled apart by courts, media, and governors acting on instinct. Would the Senate have the space to do what it does best, to slow the temperature down by giving events a legal shape people could recognize. The emissary answered with the same careful diction, but he softened it, offering the Senate something that sounded like partnership rather than assignment. He spoke about protecting congressional initiative, about avoiding isolated votes that could be attacked as improvisation, about ensuring the Senate had a coherent narrative before compressed timelines forced decisions. He did not describe deadlines as ultimatums. He described them as realities that could be managed if Congress moved with discipline. When Alcolumbre pressed, asking what “support” meant in practice, the liaison answered with examples that sounded routine, almost boring, which made them easier to accept. Regular briefings, predictable communication lines, advance notice of urgent items, a shared messaging posture that kept the burden from falling on one institution alone. It was still vague, but it was vague in a way that felt protective rather than evasive. The emissary then offered a final note, framed as respect for Alcolumbre’s instincts: the Senate should be ready for compressed votes not because anyone wanted to rush Congress, but because delay would let narratives harden, and once narratives hardened, the Senate would be forced into choices with less room to dignify them. Alcolumbre did not object, because nothing in the wording demanded objection. He instead stated his condition as if it were a normal institutional requirement, the sort of thing any serious crisis manager would insist upon: if Congress moved quickly, it would need a public rationale strong enough to shelter its members afterward, and it would need that rationale early, before panic filled the empty space. What Alcolumbre did not see, or chose not to see in that moment, was that the emissary’s “support” was designed to feel like insulation while functioning as containment. The briefings would arrive already filtered, the timelines already fixed, the narrative already written in a register that Congress could repeat, but not truly edit.When the meeting ended and the door closed, the emissary allowed himself the smallest release of tension, the kind that comes when a variable is quietly reduced. Alcolumbre had asked for protection from being isolated, and he had been offered the only protection the new center was willing to grant: a script, a lane, and the illusion of shared authorship, so that when history cooled, Congress could be told it had acted, even if it had never steered. The Senate had not been ordered. It had been courted, and the courtship was the trap, because it encouraged Alcolumbre to believe that being approached meant being included, right up until the moment inclusion became indistinguishable from compliance.

The meeting with [Tarcísio de Freitas](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarc%C3%ADsio_de_Freitas) was held away from Brasília’s ritual language, and it felt sharper because his instincts were sharper. He listened less like a technocrat being briefed and more like a man deciding whether history had finally offered the opening he had spent years waiting to justify. The emissaries described the likely post election problem as a governability vacuum, not a financial collapse. Banks would still open, payroll would still run, the state would still function. Tarcísio accepted that premise without comfort in it. To him, the danger was deeper and more moral than administrative: a Republic where legality had become a weapon, where institutions had learned to rule by injunction and narrative, and where elected power was tolerated only when it submitted to a permanent tribunal. He spoke of sovereignty in the blunt language of someone tired of explanation, of a nation that could no longer be managed as an experiment, a cautionary tale, or a lecture delivered by courts and coalitions that answered to nobody.In which crime was not merely a security issue but a symptom of state abdication, and abdication had become policy disguised as compassion, the kind that produced disorder and then pretended disorder was inevitable.

He did not hide his ideological clarity behind managerial phrasing. He called the moment a correction that would not come twice, a necessary reassertion of hierarchy, authority, and national direction, and he spoke of the coming rupture as something to be confronted, not merely contained. Yet even in that hardness he returned, repeatedly, to the same tactical point: a transition that looked improvised would rot from the inside and hand ammunition to every opponent at once. If the country broke after the election, the response would need to be bounded and legible, not because he feared being judged, but because legitimacy had to be seized and held, and governors and markets needed to understand that the new center of gravity was firm, not chaotic. When asked whether he would cooperate in a post election stabilization scenario, he did not offer the language of neutrality. He offered commitment, framed as duty. If the alternative was paralysis that fed disorder, fragmented authority, and prolonged what he saw as an era of institutional humiliation, he would lend his civilian face and administrative credibility to a restoration that was openly directional, openly corrective, and unapologetic about placing the state back above the forces that had learned to defy it. 

By the end of July, nothing existed on paper that could be waved in front of a judge or a journalist, and that was deliberate. What existed instead was alignment through conviction and posture, a shared understanding that the New Republic’s habits would not survive the first real crisis. Congress, opportunistic and anxious, had been brought close enough to move quickly when the moment demanded it. The security institutions had said as little as possible while making their hierarchy, and their patience, unmistakably clear.

How they walk into a room and everyone suddenly orbits around them? Or how you end up doing things you never intended to do, and you can't even figure out when you said yes?

Yeah, that's not an accident.

I spent months diving deep into books on psychology, power dynamics, and influence after realizing I was being played like a fiddle by people I thought cared about me. Turns out, manipulation isn't some evil supervillain shit. It's everywhere. Your boss does it. Your friends do it. Hell, even that barista who remembers your name is doing it. The difference is whether they're using these tactics consciously or not, and whether they're using them to help or exploit you.

Here's what I learned from studying this stuff, from Robert Greene to Robert Cialdini, and yeah, it's uncomfortable. But knowledge is power. Let's break down how people manipulate you without you even noticing.

# Step 1: The Reciprocity Trap

This one's sneaky as hell. Someone does you a small favor, something you didn't even ask for. They buy you coffee. They help you move a box. They compliment your outfit. Feels nice, right?

Wrong. Now you owe them.

[Cialdini's Influence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28815.Influence) breaks this down perfectly. Humans are hardwired with a reciprocity instinct. When someone gives you something, your brain creates this uncomfortable feeling of debt. You feel obligated to return the favor, often with something bigger than what you received.

Sales people LIVE off this. That free sample at Costco? They know you're more likely to buy the whole box after trying one bite. That ""friend"" who always offers to help with small stuff but then asks for massive favors? They're banking on reciprocity.

How to spot it: Ask yourself, did I ask for this favor? Is there a pattern of small gifts followed by big requests? If someone's generosity feels strategic rather than genuine, your gut is probably right.

# Step 2: Manufactured Scarcity and Urgency

""Only 3 spots left!"" ""Sale ends tonight!"" ""Everyone's doing it, you don't want to miss out!""

This is FOMO weaponized. Manipulators create artificial scarcity to make you act without thinking. They know that when you believe something is rare or running out, your rational brain takes a backseat and your emotional brain slams the gas pedal.

In Pre-Suasion, Cialdini talks about how manipulators don't just persuade you in the moment, they set up the conditions beforehand to make you more susceptible. They plant the seed of scarcity before they even make their pitch.

That ""friend"" who suddenly needs your decision RIGHT NOW? That romantic partner who implies other people are interested in them? They're manufacturing urgency to bypass your critical thinking.

Reality check: Legitimate opportunities don't evaporate in 24 hours. If someone's rushing you, they're trying to prevent you from thinking clearly.

# Step 3: The Foot in the Door Technique

This one's diabolical. Someone asks you for something tiny, something so small you'd feel like an asshole for saying no. ""Can you just sign this petition?"" ""Can I ask you one quick question?"" ""Could you just hold this for a second?""

You say yes because it's nothing, right?

But now they've got you. Research shows that people who agree to small requests are WAY more likely to agree to bigger ones later. It's called consistency bias. Your brain wants to stay consistent with the identity of someone who helps, someone who says yes.

Before you know it, you've gone from signing a petition to donating money to volunteering your whole weekend. The progression feels natural, but it was engineered from the start.

Watch for: Anyone who starts with unreasonably small requests followed by escalating asks. That's not organic friendship or collaboration, that's strategic manipulation.

# Step 4: Love Bombing and Intermittent Reinforcement

This is the dark heart of emotional manipulation. Someone showers you with affection, attention, and validation. They make you feel like the most special person alive. You get addicted to that feeling.

Then they pull back. Suddenly they're cold, distant, or critical. Your brain goes into panic mode. What did I do wrong? How do I get that good feeling back?

So you chase. You work harder. You compromise your boundaries. And occasionally, they reward you with another hit of that validation. This is intermittent reinforcement, the same mechanism that makes slot machines so addictive.

Attached by Amir Levine breaks down how this plays out in relationships. People with anxious attachment styles are especially vulnerable to this pattern. The manipulator isn't being inconsistent by accident, they're training you to work for their approval.

Red flag: If someone's affection feels conditional and unpredictable, if you're constantly trying to earn back the warmth they once gave freely, you're being manipulated.

# Step 5: Gaslighting Your Reality

""That never happened."" ""You're too sensitive."" ""You're remembering it wrong."" ""Everyone else thinks you're overreacting.""

Gaslighting is manipulation designed to make you doubt your own perception, memory, and sanity. The manipulator denies things they said or did, even when you have clear memories. They reframe your reasonable reactions as crazy or dramatic.

Over time, you stop trusting yourself. You start relying on their version of reality instead of your own instincts. And that's exactly where they want you, dependent and confused.

The Gaslight Effect by [Dr. Robin Stern](https://robinstern.com) lays out the stages of this manipulation. It starts small, with little denials or distortions, and escalates until you can't trust your own mind.

Truth bomb: Your feelings and perceptions are valid. If someone consistently makes you feel crazy for having normal human reactions, they're the problem, not you.

# Step 6: The Authority Costume

People manipulate by borrowing credibility they haven't earned. They drop names, credentials, or affiliations to make you think they're experts or insiders. ""My friend who works at Google said..."" ""As someone with 10 years of experience..."" ""Studies show...""

But when you dig deeper, those credentials are flimsy or fabricated. That ""friend at Google"" works in the cafeteria. Those ""studies"" don't exist.

Influence breaks down how we're conditioned to obey authority figures, even when that authority is fake. Manipulators wear the costume of expertise to bypass your skepticism.

Verify everything: Don't accept authority claims at face value. Ask for specifics. Check sources. Real experts don't mind being questioned.

# Step 7: Triangulation and Social Proof

""Everyone thinks you're being difficult."" ""Other people have no problem with this."" ""I was talking to Sarah and even she agrees with me.""

Triangulation is when a manipulator brings third parties into the conflict to make you feel isolated and wrong. They create the illusion that everyone is against you, even if those other people never actually said what the manipulator claims.

Humans are tribal. We look to the group for validation. Manipulators exploit this by manufacturing fake consensus.

Crucial Conversations teaches you how to spot and counter this tactic. When someone invokes other people's opinions, ask to speak with those people directly. Watch how fast the manipulator backpedals.

# Step 8: Emotional Blackmail and Guilt Trips

""After everything I've done for you..."" ""I guess I'm just a terrible person then."" ""If you really cared about me, you'd do this.""

Emotional blackmail uses your empathy and conscience against you. The manipulator positions themselves as the victim of YOUR boundaries or decisions. They make you feel guilty for having needs or saying no.

Emotional Blackmail by Susan Forward nails this pattern. FOG is the acronym: Fear, Obligation, Guilt. That's the toxic soup manipulators cook to control you.

The antidote: Your boundaries are not punishment. You're allowed to say no without being responsible for someone else's emotional reaction.

# Step 9: Information Control

Manipulators control what you know and when you know it. They share information selectively, leave out crucial details, or time revelations strategically. They keep you operating with an incomplete picture so you can't make fully informed decisions.

Maybe they don't tell you about other options. Maybe they frame situations in ways that serve their agenda. Maybe they ""forget"" to mention important facts until after you've committed.

This isn't forgetfulness. It's strategic withholding.

Ask questions: Who benefits if I don't know the full story? What am I not being told? Why is this information being revealed now?

# How to Fight Back

Look, you can't avoid manipulation entirely. It's baked into human interaction. But you can develop immunity.

Get comfortable with discomfort. Manipulators rely on your desire to avoid awkwardness or conflict. Practice saying no without explanation. Get okay with silence. Stop rushing to fill conversational gaps or smooth over tension.

Trust your gut. If something feels off, it probably is. Your instincts pick up on manipulation faster than your conscious mind. Stop talking yourself out of your own red flags.

Slow down decisions. Most manipulation requires speed. Take time. Sleep on it. Talk to people outside the manipulator's influence.

Build your knowledge. The more you understand these tactics, the faster you spot them. Read the books. Study the patterns. Become fluent in the language of influence.

If you want to go deeper into social psychology and influence but find dense psychology books hard to get through, there's an app called [BeFreed ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450)cthat makes this kind of learning way more digestible. It's built by Columbia alumni and pulls from research papers, psychology books like the ones mentioned here, and expert insights on manipulation, persuasion, and social dynamics. You can set a goal like ""understand psychological manipulation tactics to protect myself"" and it generates a personalized learning plan with audio lessons you can listen to during your commute. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 15-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. Makes absorbing this stuff feel less like homework and more like an addictive podcast.

The goal isn't to become cynical or paranoid. It's to become empowered. When you can see manipulation for what it is, you take back control. You make choices based on YOUR values and needs, not someone else's agenda.

And that's the whole point. Your life, your rules, your decisions.",1,1770162150.0,Strongerman,0,1.0,False
1qv8agt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qv8agt/aitah_christmas_eve_drama/,AITAH Christmas Eve drama,"Strapping this a long one, and also I’m not very good at writing stories so bear with me…

Me (Mum 25) broke up with (Dad 31) in early November 2025, we share a daughter (2). As things are fresh we came to the agreement (as he wanted a full day to spend with our daughter) that dad would come over to spend Christmas Eve stay over and spend until roughly 1pm on Christmas where mum and daughter would go to families house.

Agreed more than a week in advance (and confirmed throughout the week) dad would be at mums for 10am to help with some last minuet bits.

11am rolls around on Christmas Eve, nothing heard from dad, I got on with my last minute bits that needed to be done. 11:30 I phone him to ask where he is. He was still asleep.

He says he was waiting for me to call to ask him where he was (granted I could have text and asked him where he was when 10 o’clock had passed but why should I have to when that was the plan)

I said no worries I’ve sorted my last minute bits let me know when your on your way, he responds with I need to go food shopping (ON CHRISTMAS EVE AND YOU WAS MEANT TO BE HERE AT 10! but I kept that to myself) wrap our daughters presents from him and wanted to get our favourite meal for all of us for dinner that is a hour round trip at least.

I sigh say ok I’ll see you when you get here.

1pm rolls round our daughters Asking for her dad so I give him a call to see how he’s getting on. I woke him up again. Nothing on his list is done. I said again ok let me know when you’re on your way.

3:30pm rolls around. I call again. YOU GUESSED IT HE FELL ASLEEP AGAINNNN!!!

He says I’m getting up now. I asked him if he still had to do everything on his list. Dad said yeh I need to do my food shop and I want to get us dinner and I’m not going to wrap the presents because I don’t have time.

I told him he has to wrap the presents for her it’s the best bit for our 2 year old she loves unwrapping more than the actual gifts.

4:30pm now and I get a call saying I’m about to leave to do a food shop (obviously doesn’t know about holiday hours)  and get the food. I ask have you wrapped. He said no.

Just want to add his flakiness (saying he would be somewhere and just held off until I would eventually say don’t bother) and lack of awareness of people’s time was one of the reasons we broke up.

This is where I want to know AITAH?

I said to him to leave coming over tonight we will see you at 7am tomorrow so you can surprise her. it’s 4:30 you have at least 2 hours worth of things to do, our daughter eats at 4:30/5 has a bath and is very often asks to go to bed at 6:30. By the time he arrives she’s ready for bed and then she gets all excited to see her dad (she adores him.)

We got into an argument where words were exchanged on both sides but I kept saying just do what you need to do and we will see you in the morning. He didn’t come over that night.

CHRISTMAS MORNING ARRIVES, I wake up at 6:30 to have a coffee and a moment of peace, 7am hits no sign of dad, 7:45 daughter wakes up, I call dad twice no answer. I wait until 8:15 thinking maybe he was driving. (me trying to rationalise him not being there yet he only lives a 10 minute drive) Nope. He never answers or arrives. I had a little cry, went to get my daughter up and we get on with our morning, daughter smiling ear to ear shouting santaaa santaaa. Left mine at 11 instead of 1 to spend time with my family.

2pm ish text dad merry Christmas love mum and daughter and a few pics, read and ignored… 8pm a aggy text that I put a post on fb having Christmas with my parents, siblings and daughter. Apparently everyone is more important then him. He then asked to have her Boxing Day which I said no to, I have plans and if he wanted to spend the Christmas holidays with her he could have he’s the one who chose not to.

So AITAH?

Should I have just let him come over at 6pm when he was meant to be there at 10am ?

Should I have let him have our daughter for Boxing Day?

How many times can I let him let her down? (Not the first major event he’s missed)

First light. They were still out there, those broken puppets on the pavement.

A strange van arrived as the red still banked the horizon. Several slinking shadows emerged from it, only moving between the frames. The back unhinged, snake-like, swallowing the scene’s inhabitants.

A parcel remained in their wake, simply appearing on the doorstep when the image arrived. It bore no moniker or label. Several minutes elapsed before I built the courage to allow my hand to cross the threshold. The air was blistering, even in the early morning hours.

Within the parcel there was a week's worth of food and drink. I haven’t attempted to eat any of it, though my stomach aches. Something about it feels wrong and my mind is elsewhere. 

My mother messaged me last night when the humming started. 

*\[Mother: I can’t see.\]*

Something is wrong. I feel nauseous again. Maybe it’s just the Sun sickness.

# July 23, 2026

I will write down the event, if it can be called that, and if memory can be trusted. I doubt it can, but I will attempt to regardless, if simply to convince myself I may find a thread of truth within this bright nightmare.

The day started out like any other. I was on the way to fetch a fifth of whiskey, passing the nameless peddlers that littered the streets. I can almost recall some of their faces now, but they vanish when I try to hold them in my mind. The sky above was an implacable mass of gray, welling with tension that remained unbroken for days. Fog sat like a pallid mask on everything. I navigated the tents lining the sidewalk, over the junkies lying in the wet when the clouds suddenly broke loose. They scattered hurriedly across the length of the sky, parted like curtains by an invisible hand to reveal the Sun. Crepuscular morning beams leapt sharply from the puddles, growing brighter. A vagrant attempted to trouble me, but I lowered my head as if I didn’t hear him. The situation was best left alone, as was I. 

I had been that way for a long time. *\[Gone.\]* My mind was made up. A final drunken bout and enter the Solace Chamber downtown. It had crossed my mind many times before, but this was the first time I had gone so far as to schedule an appointment. I was pre-approved after a short questionnaire. The vagrant continued to pester me further, and I carried on until he became nothing but a soft noise. My eyes were following the sprawling cracks lining the broken sidewalk when they vanished. 

A flash—white light. Darkness. 

I fell to my knees, sightless. My skin was crawling with a warm static, like innumerable vibrating needles piercing the exposed flesh. I reached out for help, but no one was there. I tried to scream, but my voice was elsewhere too. Then the smell of burning flesh drifted into my nose. I crawled on my belly back to my house, blinded and terrified. I didn’t understand. Everything simply stopped, caught in time like a picture. There should have been a cacophony of cars crashing, panicked screams, any sound at all, but no. Those few minutes were excruciatingly long, dragging myself across the hot concrete.

Once home, I ran sightlessly through the rooms closing the curtains. The light still seeped in and I could taste it, lingering in the air. My fingers were inflamed and raw as I shakily navigated my blurry phone, leaving blood smears across the screen. I squinted through weeping eyes, and the first thing visible was an emergency alert broadcast that read: 

***\[EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM:***

***DHS/FEMA***

***A MAJOR SOLAR EVENT*** *is currently in effect.* 

***DO NOT LOOK INTO THE SUN***

***TAKE SHELTER*** *until further notice*

*Widespread communication interference likely.\]*

I pressed my throbbing finger into the dismiss button. My skin was bleeding, even where the flesh was not tattered from the crawl. I called the police, I don’t know why, receiving nothing but a distant, pulsing tone. Or perhaps it was the sound of my own blood coursing in my ears that drowned any voice that would have come through. The internet was still working, but social media was a maelstrom, none of it made any sense. Threads decayed as I scrolled through them. Videos play differently each time I click. A post that began with shaky mobile-camera footage of a man trying to stop his dead-eyed wife from going outside became a polished recreation upon rewinding, complete with a text-to-speech dub that described the scene differently. 

*\[The blind woman is cured by the Sunlight, her husband is astonished.\]*

Statements from accredited physics professors, or at least their likeness, implied the Sun is bleeding to purge itself of impurities, as if it were a conscious effort. Perhaps it is. The line between the absurd and the observed dissolved in the deluge of discordant explanations that flooded the internet. 

*\[It’s Project Blue Beam. The angels are probably fake too.\]*

*\[It’s closer, not brighter. It’s below the clouds.\]*

*\[China has been building an artificial Sun underground since 1998. They’ve finally used it.\]* 

*\[John 3:19 I’m going out there and you should too if you have nothing to hide from the LORD.\]*

*\[A cover-up if I’ve ever seen one. Government gas leak that lit the atmosphere on fire, sad.\]*

*\[Everyone asking for proof must be blind, that’s literally how light works.\]*

The noise online gnaws at what little truth I still hold. Each reply is a sycophantic garble of automated praise. Nobody is wrong, and no one is saying the same thing. I remain bedridden with a case of Sun sickness, in which my skin peels from me like dried glue. Black spots drift like spirits through my periphery, shadowy spectators of the digital kaleidoscope that I’m stuck in. 

No word from the government since *take shelter until further notice*. There is no true way to determine who is an authority on any matter. 

*\[You have to see it to believe it,\]* they say. 

*\[I was right all along,\]* they laugh, between the endless nameless obituaries.

# July 27, 2026

\[It’s just daylight bleeding through,\] but the Sun shouldn’t be *bleeding* at all. The whole world drowns in its blood, and no one cares. That's if the world *out there* actually persisted without my witness.

I don’t have much to go on that hasn’t been laid waste by algorithms. At one point I believed I uncovered legitimate footage with a solar lense, though I am unsure now. It began as a coronal mass ejection originating from the belly of the Sun. Incandescent beams arced the surface, breaking free, twisting about the ichorous void. They culminated in a violent swirl that crested up to the star’s crown as a brilliant halo. A flash. The whirling glow dispersed, spreading like squid's ink in water to encompass the space between us in radiant tendrils of gold and amethyst. A thing you can almost see breathing, stretching slowly towards us each day, getting closer. Ever closer.

*\[UV INDEX: 18 – MODERATE\]*

The days have grown so tremendously luminous that, with direct exposure, one could be stricken with Sun sickness within a walk to the mailbox. Prolonged exposure is a death sentence, bereft of mercy. Man and monument were both laid bare in that cleansing light, the infrastructure itself taking on the appearance of a dried corpse. Roofing shingles curled like fingernails. Windows hazed like cataracts. Everything faded to a gray thing. In that infernal ire, man endures only long enough to remember his native tongue. Dust. 

Inside offers no respite from the burning gaze. Rolling blackouts have become more frequent—between gales of terrestrial and heavenly sources—cutting off the world entirely. When the air goes motionless, thoughts turn feral. My inhibitions quickly devolve into their most animalistic, and without the comfort of artificial luminance, each light is predatory. I pace around, searching for them. But it remains that even a tenuous grasp on the world is better than none when it finally goes dark. Now, anything could be lurking there. The house unfurls into a symphony of ineffable echoes.

*\[Thud.\]*

*\[Clatter.\]*

Outside becomes, paradoxically, the greatest fear and the only salvation. I still have the choice, and I can bide my time deciding. Others have had salvation set upon them with raging fires, engulfing entire city blocks, speckling the distance in a flickering orange vagueness. Ash and soot fall like fat snowflakes. The world has been made to kindle. Entire ecosystems have, likely, been expunged from existence. It can only be a matter of time before the food stops coming, for it already runs thin. The second delivery had half the supplies.

When that grinning skeletal moon hangs, the bleeding stains the stars. It bathes three parts of the night in a bilious yellow aurora and a faint electrical hum, like the soft cooing of a robotic mother. The cadence is insidiously familiar, in a way that reverberates through my mind, shaking loose buried memories.  It calls to people after dusk, and they stand outside with their mouths agape, staring dumbly into that strange, inky tendril of light churning the bitter void. They carry a euphoric malaise in their eyes—some beautiful burden. Not a word, nor gesture, nor any motion that could be construed as sentient emerges from those swaying silhouettes in the street. 

They make their pilgrimages at all points in the night, seemingly all for unrelated reasons—going to a friend's house, walking the dog—heads down in their phones to avoid the uncomfortable and uncanny stillness that surrounds them. Then, they happen to glance up to look at a sign or avoid bumping into another looming figure in the street, and they see those great glittering wisps sliding their way across the crashing waves of the aurora. By some particular or non-particular point in the sky, it utterly transfixes them. They stand staggered for hours, with dangling arms outstretched, through the night. Dogs look at their masters, puzzled, before slinking off into the unnatural twilight. They remain enraptured in its splendor, until the same caress of the cosmos burns and bubbles their faces come morning light. They arrive back to reality with a profound bemusement, as if they had merely blinked and it was morning. Others cannot pull themselves back. They follow the light, mindless as a sunflower, until they drop, disappearing come dawn.

I try not to stare out there for too long at them, lest I fall under the same spell of those strange puppets. I use the doorbell camera to monitor them safely, though the feed often dies or gets corrupted completely. Windows are too risky. Mine remain sealed in layers of crumbling cardboard. The outermost layer has begun to bake in the Sun’s gaze, making it brittle. Through the cracks, the light twists in like the aroma of a cartoon pie, beckoning me to the windows to come and see.

While in bed, the humming crescendoes. A low, throat-deep vibration that settles in the marrow. It emanates from deep within the house, projecting itself through the outlets. In the distance, through the thinning walls, I can hear a dog barking. Harsh howling. I drink to sleep.

*\[ALERT: PERSON DETECTED AT THE FRONT DOOR\]*

They’re out there now, in their catatonic lunacy, beckoning the nigh dawn. 

# July 30, 2026

Nothing new has happened since yesterday, though I do wonder what became of that woman. I should stop watching the feed in the morning, it’s a terrible way to start the day. This morning, instead, I opted to just make some coffee. After checking for light in the windows, I thought it might make the morning feel normal. The tap sputtered brown, before running clear and I stood haggardly in the kitchen waiting for it to boil. The electricity came in erratic waves, and the heat pulsed infrequently. My arms still itched. I fought the urge to pick at the peeling skin. The kitchen is bare so my eyes wander to the clock on the microwave. It flashed, *\[12:00,\]* repeatedly. I watched this for some time, waiting for something to change, another trick of the light, but it never did. Before I realized it, the water was half-boiled away. 

I had my remarkably small cup of coffee in the living room, which retained the same monochrome mundanity of the kitchen. The room is sparsely furnished, containing only a couch, coffee table, and entertainment stand fit with a hardly functioning television. Not much to look at. I was watching the white light flicker against the cool gray walls, mindlessly rolling a bottle under my foot, when a blackout occurred. The wind was blowing hard and the house creaked uncomfortably, unable to settle through the agitation. *\[Thud.\]* I had been avoiding it till this point, but I pulled out my phone to distract myself. It worked. The power came on later, once I had nearly fallen unconscious from heatstroke. 

# August 1, 2026

The memory of mankind is burning before my eyes, so I’ve turned to the collection of books my mother left behind. They’ve been gathering dust in a room I rarely use—a sequestered storage of the cluttered past, though little lingers of mine. They filled cardboard boxes, which I had been tearing apart to cover the windows, and now overflowed onto the floor by the bookshelf that I still had not built. Philosophy, history, religion—a lot of religion. The spines are warped and yellowed, but at least they don’t change when I look away. 

I’ve been going through them today, attempting to find something that might be able to explain anything that is happening. So far, the only thing I’ve found are passing similarities within religious references to the Sun or common celestial phenomena. 

*There appeared a phenomenon beyond belief: for before sunset there were seen over the whole country chariots and troops of soldiers in their armor running about among the clouds, and surrounding cities. Moreover, a star resembling a sword stood over the city, and a comet continued a whole year.*

# August 3, 2026

I woke up late and checked the feed. The camera showed a motionless figure lying face-up on the sidewalk. The image was obfuscated in the white, so I adjusted the exposure, and the burnt cityscape came into view. Across the street the fading facade of the building caught the light and held it, breaking under the pressure. The windows were uncovered, the door sat ajar, titled on its hinges like a poorly hung painting. I do not know who lives in them, nor have I seen any packages arrive at their homes.

 A large crater had formed in the crumbling pavement, as if struck by a silent missile, amidst an unseen war. Next to it, the figure laid there as if he had crawled from the hole itself, skin burgundy and blistered. Thick globules of fat simmered from volcanic lesions. They looked as if they had been molded by an arthritic hand in red clay and clinker. Two bulging, bloodshot eyes stared straight into the gaping wound in the sky, vibrating excitedly. I recognized the tattered clothing as that of a vagrant who once worked the corner down the road. Cheap cargo pants, faded graphic tee, and sneakers repaired with fraying tape. It seemed he collapsed under the weight of his wares. A bindle of cheap sunglasses, once traded for dope, sat broken on the street. By every sane measure, a wandering man should not have lasted that long out there. I pondered how he came to die here.

I attempted to call the authorities, but the system was unable to locate my address due to satellite disruption. I eventually had my call routed to Manual Services, only to be made aware that Manual Services is temporarily automated, and was promptly transferred back to the bureau I started at. I hung up, exhausted from doing nothing and talking to no one. Civilized society limps on, only held by the quivering, boiled hand of an irradiated delivery driver. The last bastion between order and ruin is a parcel van on its last tank of gasoline, that still hasn’t arrived.

In the wake of multiple pandemics, global isolation wasn’t new, but this bout of collective solitude has felt noticeably different. There existed in the air an ominous stillness. No one rushed to gather supplies. There was no panic. The shelves remained stocked and sealed to the masses. I received my allotted feed delivered in insulated cardboard packaging and memes. I did not question it because there was no time to question it. It was a flash—a single frame. An image so brilliant it burned up everything but the questions.

I have been here too long. The world beyond these walls seems to drift further into the void of memory. A past that doesn’t exist, a nothing that looms over the present like smoke. I pace the room like a madman.

Don’t look at the Sun. It is bright, and it hurts.

Each day, *it* grows closer. Each day, the *silence* grows louder. 

Those drums of silence on the horizon, beating faster and faster. It makes you curl up and hide. Tucked away in those fading memories—your mother’s soft humming somewhere between your head and the wiring in the walls. 

Where have they all gone? I see them standing there, but no one's home. All those tiny lives blipped away like pixels on the screen. A bright, terrible screen but when I squint through weeping eyes, I see…

I’ve found records, stories that resemble the flash more than I’d like to admit. Patterns, maybe nothing more, but sits like a presence in the room with me, not allowing me to ignore it. On May 13, 1917, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to three shepherd children in Fatima, Portugal. *\[Mother: Make penance and sacrifices.\]* She then spoke a prophecy of a miracle that would occur. *\[The Miracle of the Sun.\]* I believe that this may be relevant to my situation. But prophecy, without its context, can be twisted. I found a thread to follow within another dusty book. The turn of the century marked the culmination of humanity’s most influential global revolution. Industry. Gone were the grim toils of antiquity, and here was the proverbial *future*. But, the truth of the matter is this future would couple with man’s oldest tradition—the shedding of blood. 

The Great War, the war to end all wars. 

The fields died, and factories grew in their place, vomiting smoke and metal into the twisted visage of death. The pale horse was pumped with the black blood of extinction and let loose so that man’s only responsibility was keeping the tally. The men did not march under this pretense; however, they still believed they were marching vigilantly towards the \[dawn of a new era.\] Into a strange, golden world where their children will not bear the burdens they did. But beyond that beautiful horizon, they unwittingly fell off the face of the earth and into the ink of a spreadsheet.

# August 6, 1915

A dense blanket of fog swaddles a river in the pale hush before first light. The dispirited infantry stare into a dark gray abyss, in which unseen forces lie in wait. Sickness plagues them torrentially, and their feet fuse to their boots in the rotting wet. They speak in Russian with pestilence lingering on their breath. Rats move with impunity among them, dragging bellies filled with filth and disease. The makeshift sepulchers, excavated from the trench shoring, have collapsed from rain, leaving waxen limbs reaching out like roots looking for water. They hoist another haphazardly into the pile after finding him dead, still holding the mercy dog. 

The stillness of the morning is punctuated by the sound of the first artillery round, landing just outside their dugout. They jump to attention, their bodies moving with precision. They act as automata of blood and soil, executing reflexes carved by a year of fire. Their lifeless eyes scan the horizon for the possible infantry push between shellings, but there is *\[no man\]* to see. 

*\[See me.\]* What approaches them, as quiet and graceful as a butterfly, is a lurid green cloud of death several kilometers wide. Plumes of the noxious fumes claw at the air on the back of a gentle tailwind, in which all things die. Leaves curl in yellow clumps, grass turns black as a sackcloth of hair, woven into a tapestry of decay. It silently pours over the fields and through ditches and craters, smothering the landscape in its expanse. The men are utterly unprepared. Without gas masks, they are roused from their mechanical despondency and are once again inundated with the primal panic of an imminent death. Some hastily attempt to put together makeshift masks from bandages and rags, urinating on them and placing them to their mouths. Others are left scavenging for materials when the dense cloud breaches the parapet. 

The screaming begins as the soldiers realize they are trapped in the all-encompassing force, from which there is no escape. Their flesh is corroded, eyes red and swollen as their tear ducts fill with acid. Breath turns to blood, and they drown in themselves. 

There is a weeping and gnashing of teeth that grows in silence until nothing remains, save the wind.

*The battalion and I advanced through the fog of no man's land shortly after the gas had dispersed. Visibility was low, and we remained cautious.

It was quiet for an area that had just an hour ago been awash with screaming and \[hellfire.\]*

*They began lurching at us with bayonets, and we took fire from more corpses on the walls. They screamed through wet gurgles and charged us. Our men fell quickly.

I became slick with blood and managed to slide out. I looked back to see hundreds of them approaching \[brokenly\] out of the fog towards us.*

# October 13, 1917

The barren field is drowned. Rain falls heavy, soaking the wool and linen of the thousands of pilgrims standing cheek by jowl in the deep muck. Their hymns to God ring before a goodly holm oak, under which the three shepherd children sit.

It is noon time when there arises a fine, purple smoke above the children’s crowns. This phenomenon, clearly visible to the naked eye, has no known genesis. All the attention of the crowd is cast upon the children when the rain ceases. There is a quiet that falls on the many. Then the clouds rent in twain across the great length of the sky, revealing the Sun, who shines light upon the whole of the countryside. Their gaze falls on the Sun without harm, and thousands of voices cry out in praise, as it emitted a spectrum of unnameable colors and hues through the air. Neither veiled nor dimmed, these beautiful dancing lights cascade down and smother them in brilliance. Light shatters in angles of immeasurable dimensions, and they feel the breath of creation, warm on their face. They stand with their mouths agape, staring dumbly into that great unknowable thing. The Sun then sprouted spokes of gold and amethyst and spins like a flaming chariot wheel, and begins moving as if to dislodge its place in the firmament. Without sound, the Sun seems to break free and give chase to them. A single, awful scream pierces the air, stripping the crowd from their stupor. Recoiling in terror at the sight of that fast-approaching Red Hunger. Its lustre now menacingly swallows them whole. Waves of the travelers churn in panic, attempting to run from something you cannot run from. Others resign their fate and merely weep in prayer. 

Then nothing. The field grows more silent till no sound remains, save the wind, which carries an omen they do not heed. A year later, plague rises from the trenches and sweeps the world, a fever wrought from the arrows of the same God that shone over Fatima.

Now that presence lies its warmth upon my door. It shoots at me blindly and never misses my cover. The bow reverberates ominously. Its breadth is as wide as the eyes grasp, and as long as I see it will find me. It sneaks in with the quietness of a mouse, wafting its odious light through the stagnant air like a sickness. I try to use my tools to catch it—but it’s too bright, and the exposure can never be lowered enough. It gnaws through every barricade I have built. It devours my feed, and my body aches from the emptiness, so I devour myself. I repent. I make penances. I have nothing left to sacrifice. She still offers me for punishment. Still humming.

I rewatch the footage a hundred times, but there is no one to open the door. *Out there* is a place for *no man*. Just corpses firing from their walls, their wire veins scrawling black blood on a dead internet. I crawl deeper into the muck of my trench, but man will always innovate. They always find a way, no matter the cost. We were never meant to wield fire…I am left to interpret the ash. 

*\[THE SUN: Casualties Rising as Fighting Persists, No End in Sight.\]*

*\[THE OBSERVER: Troops Advance, Clash at the Border.\]*

Frame by frame, I chart every movement.

None of it is right, but it doesn’t change.

The dust artifacts, and it floats upward.

He’s closer to the curb than he was—

not by much, maybe a pixel or two.

But then it corrected itself again.

Something here feels wrong…

The door opens on its own.

The humming got louder.

The frames bleed out—

and it hurts my eyes.

Nothing changes.

It just corrupts.

What *is* that?

I can’t *see*.

Replay it. 

Again.

1qv85tv,https://www.reddit.com/r/sciencefiction/comments/1qv85tv/my_cool_ftl_plot_deviceimo/,My cool FTL plot device..IMO,"Hey I'm just starting a new space travel SciFi series. I've got a couple chapters already. It's still a work in progress. I'm so excited about my FTL tech premise I had to share. It's called Lightly Killed. Please give me opinions....

Chapter 1

Captain Elena Voss straightened her uniform as the shuttle docked. Senator Bradley Hutchins—three terms representing the outer colonies, zero trips beyond Jupiter. The kind of politician who voted on FTL infrastructure bills without ever having jumped.

“Captain Voss.” Hutchins emerged from the airlock, hand extended, smile practiced. Mid-fifties, soft around the middle, eyes that looked past you rather than at you. “Beautiful ship. The Heraclitus, yes?”

“Yes, Senator. Welcome aboard.” She gestured down the corridor. “If you’ll follow me, I’ll show you to the ship.”

They walked through the crew quarters—Hutchins nodding absently at the off-duty staff—and into the central spine. Through the viewport, the forward array dominated the view: a massive parabolic dish, maybe sixty meters across, its surface covered in what looked like millions of hexagonal mirrors.

“Impressive,” Hutchins said. “So this must be the dissolution array?”

“Forward array, yes sir.” Elena was somewhat impressed as she directed his attention to the panels. “Each of those hexagonal cells is a quantum resonance mirror. When we initiate the jump sequence, they create a cascading wave pattern that—”

“Turns you into light. Yes, I know a bit about this. It gives me shudders.” He peered closer. “And there’s another one at the back?”

“The aft array. Same configuration, different function. The forward array initiates dissolution and encodes our quantum state. The aft array receives that information and handles reconstruction at the destination.”

Hutchins was quiet for a moment. “Captain, I need to ask—my staff assures me this won’t affect my schedule, but jump travel… when I return, how much time will have passed?”

Elena looked puzzled. “Thirty seconds, Senator. The same thirty seconds we’re gone.”

“But I thought… jump travel causes time dilation. My grandfather was a Phase 1 pilot. He’d leave for a year-long tour, experience maybe a week subjectively, but come home to find his children had grown, his wife had aged. He missed years of their lives.”

Elena’s expression shifted. “Hutchins. Wait—Admiral Hutchins? Garrett Hutchins?”

The Senator blinked. “You know the name?”

“Every jump pilot knows that name, Senator. He’s in the history courses. The Meridian Route, the first successful multi-jump expedition to—” She stopped. “He was your grandfather?”

“Great-great-great-great grandfather, technically. But I knew him. He lived with us when I was young.” Hutchins smiled slightly. “Strange thing, time dilation. He was born almost three hundred years before me, but I have memories of sitting on his knee, listening to his stories. He’d missed his own children’s lives almost entirely—they’d grown old and died while he was light. But he got to meet me. Got to meet his great-great-great-great-grandchildren before he passed.”

Elena was quiet for a moment, recalculating her assessment of the man in front of her.

“He told me about coming home from a six-month mission—six months for him—to find his daughter was fifty years old. She didn’t even recognize him at first. He’d left when she was ten.” Hutchins looked out at the viewport. “That’s why I asked about time dilation. I wanted to make sure I wouldn’t have to deal with agendas that belong in the archives.”

Understanding crossed Elena’s face. “That was Phase 1 technology, Senator. Your grandfather traveled at light speed. Zero time for him in transit, but years passing at home while he was light. We don’t do that anymore.”

“Phase 2 technology means you won’t have to make that choice, Senator. We solved that problem. Through the dark energy field. You’ve heard of dark energy, Senator?”

“Vaguely. Makes up most of the universe, right? We don’t know what it is?”

“We know more than we used to. The breakthrough came when physicists realized that dark energy maintains quantum entanglement from the Big Bang—a primordial connection between all points in space. When we dissolve into light, the forward array encodes our complete quantum state and transmits it instantly through the dark energy substrate.”

“Instantly?” Hutchins looked skeptical. “Faster than light?”

“Yes, faster than light. Well, actually faster than anything. The information travels through dark field quantum entanglement, which isn’t bound by light speed. We can travel anywhere with no delay. The aft array at our destination receives the quantum blueprint immediately and uses it to reconstruct us—atom by atom, using energy borrowed from the local dark energy field.”

“Borrowed?”

“Yes. The aft array draws energy from local dark energy reserves to rebuild the ship and crew. That energy is repaid when our light packet—the actual photons we became—arrives years later, traveling at normal light speed.”

Hutchins exhaled. “So I won’t return to find my committee assignments reassigned.”

“No, sir. You’ll return to find the same cup of coffee you left on your desk still warm.”

“Then what’s the catch? There’s always a catch.”

Elena’s expression flickered. “Well, we haven’t found one yet. But we are paying a different price. The dark energy we borrow has to be repaid when our light arrives years later. We’re running a debt with the universe until that happens.”

“That seems…” Hutchins struggled for words. “Seems like it could cause problems.”

“So far the math seems to work out, Senator. We’ve been doing this for almost two decades.”

They continued aft, passing through engineering. Chief Ramos glanced up from her console, caught Elena’s eye, made a subtle drinking motion. Later, Elena mouthed.

The aft observation deck mirrored the forward—another viewport, another massive array stretching behind them like a blooming flower made of mirrors.

“So explain the actual jump to me,” Hutchins said, settling into one of the observation chairs.

“The forward array generates a quantum resonance field that destabilizes molecular bonds throughout the entire ship—hull, crew, equipment, everything. It happens in literally zero time, but we describe it as propagating from bow to stern to give people a mental framework.”

“Zero time?” Hutchins frowned. “How can something happen in zero time?”

“Because at the quantum level, causality works differently than our everyday experience. In reality, the entire conversion happens in a single quantum instant. But human brains need sequence, need cause and effect, so we use the front-to-back analogy even though it’s incomplete.”

“So the ship just… converts to light. All at once.”

“A coherent light packet containing all our quantum information. That packet propagates toward our destination at light speed—the slow way, just like your grandfather’s ship did. But simultaneously, the information transmits instantly through dark energy entanglement to the aft array already in quantum space at the destination.”

“And the aft array rebuilds you.”

“Using borrowed dark energy, yes. By the time we reconstruct at our destination, no subjective time has passed for us. We experience it as instantaneous. But the light packet is still traveling, leaving a glowing trail—pearl-strings—as it excites gas and dust along the route.”

“Pearl-strings?”

“As our light packet travels, it excites atoms along its path—dust, hydrogen, trace elements. Those atoms glow for weeks or months after we pass through. From the home planet, it looks like a string of glowing pearls stretching across space, marking where we traveled.”

“So people can watch you travel, even though you’ve already arrived?”

“Exactly. We’ll jump to Proxima, spend thirty seconds there, come home—everything here has progressed exactly thirty seconds. But as our light packet travels toward Proxima over the next four years, it leaves a glowing trail visible to anyone watching. Eight years after departure, people here will see the return trail appearing as that light makes its way back.”

“You never see both paths at once?”

“Not from the endpoints. The outbound trail fades long before the return trail becomes visible. But cartographers plot both—each route curves through space as systems drift. Every journey leaves a unique signature written in light.”

Hutchins leaned back, processing. “And you’re telling me nobody experiences this? This… atomic dissolution?”

“From our reference frame as photons, no time passes. We don’t experience it because experience requires time, and photons don’t have that. We’re simply somewhere else, instantly.”

“But you were light. You were energy.”

“Yes. For that zero-duration moment, we touched something fundamental to the universe. The primordial entanglement that’s connected everything since the Big Bang. But we don’t remember it, because memory requires time, and photons exist outside of time.”

“That’s…” Hutchins shook his head. “That’s almost religious.”

“Some people see it that way. Others see it as pure physics. I’m just the pilot, Senator. I don’t pretend to understand the philosophy.”

They stood in silence for a moment. Through the viewport, a maintenance drone drifted past the aft array, checking the mirror alignment.

“What if something goes wrong?” Hutchins finally asked, quieter now. “What if the aft array fails?”

Elena’s jaw tightened. “Then the light packet continues propagating. Forever.”

“With you… with everyone… still in it?”

“The information would still be there, encoded in the photons. But without an aft array to receive it through the dark energy field and borrow the energy to reconstruct…” She trailed off.

“You’d be dead.”

“We’d be light, Senator. Whether that’s death or something else is a question I can’t answer.”

“Has it ever happened?”

Elena hesitated. “Once. The Monad, eight years ago.”

“What happened to it… to them?”

“We don’t know. The departure flash was observed. The arrival flash never came. Their pearl-strings are still out there, still extending. Just light, traveling forever.” She paused. “Some theorists think the aft array couldn’t find enough dark energy to borrow. That the region was… depleted somehow.”

Hutchins looked genuinely shaken. “And you people keep doing this?”

“Senator, sailors have been stepping aboard death rafts since the dawn of time. They crossed oceans on wooden planks, knowing storms could send them to the depths. Your grandfather knew the price of Phase 1 travel—years stolen from his family—and he paid it anyway because the colonies needed supplies, needed connection. At least on this ship, if death comes, it’s quick and unknowing.”

She met his eyes. “No bobbing in water wondering if sharks will find you. No escape pods counting down to asphyxiation and freezing. No coming home to find your children grown and your wife remarried. If something goes wrong during a jump, we don’t suffer. We simply don’t arrive. We remain as light. Maybe that’s death, maybe it’s something else. But it’s not what your grandfather endured, and it’s not screaming into a radio no one will hear.”

“But you won’t even know you existed.”

“Better than knowing you’re about to stop.” Elena straightened. “I’ve lost friends in space, Senator. I’ve heard what terror sounds like when someone has hours to contemplate their end. If my time comes during a jump, I’ll take that over the alternatives. Every single time.”

The silence stretched between them.

“We’re scheduled for a jump to Proxima Station in thirty minutes,” Elena finally said. “Just a demonstration run—we’ll return immediately. You can observe from the bridge.”

“Will I see anything?”

“No. You’ll be standing there, then standing at Proxima. Four light-years in zero seconds. Zero time for us, zero time at home. That’s what your grandfather’s generation made possible.”

“And the pearls?”

“If you come back in a month or two, you can watch them lighting up along our path. They’ll appear progressively as our light packet travels, leaving glowing gas in its wake. It’s quite beautiful, actually. Like breadcrumbs made of fire.”

—-

When they returned to the bridge, Captain Voss advised the senator to brace himself for the jump.

Hutchins gripped the observer’s rail. The countdown played on the main display.

“Ten seconds to dissolution,” the navigator called out.

“All stations report ready,” added the XO.

Elena stood calmly at the center console. Forty-seven jumps. Forty-eight after today.

“Five seconds.”

Hutchins held his breath.

“Three. Two. One. Jump.”

The stars changed.

Hutchins blinked. “Wait, what—”

“Welcome to Proxima Station, Senator,” Elena said. “Population: fourteen thousand. Local time: 0847 hours. We’ll stay for thirty seconds, then return home.”

Hutchins looked at the Captain and realized he’d fallen for the jump initiation prank. Everyone gripped the rail the first time. He released his death grip. “But I didn’t—there was no—”

“No sensation, no transition. Just instant relocation. And right now, our light packet just left home, heading this way. It’ll take four years to arrive, repaying the dark energy we just borrowed here to reconstruct. When we jump back, we’ll borrow energy at home and reconstruct again with local dark energy there. Then in four years our return light will repay it.”

Hutchins tried to grasp the concept, but it was starting to feel like a cosmic Three Card Monte.

He quickly stopped trying to figure it out as he stared at the unfamiliar stars. He could see Proxima Centauri burning red and close. “We’re really here. And my staff back home—”

“Are experiencing the same thirty seconds we are. When we return, no time will have passed for them either. That’s the miracle your grandfather helped build.”

The Senator laughed, unsteady. “He would have given anything for this. To travel the stars and still come home to the same moment he left.”

“We stand on the shoulders of giants, Senator. The Phase 1 crews paid the time. We pay… something else.”

Elena checked the chrono. “Initiating return sequence. Same experience: none at all.”

Hutchins didn’t grab the rail this time.

“Three. Two. One. Jump.”

Home sun, distant and familiar. Home.

Hutchins exhaled slowly. “I need a drink.”

“Join the club, Senator.” Elena keyed her comm. “All stations, secure from jump stations. Get the Senator to the officer’s lounge. Chief Ramos, break out the good stuff.”

As Hutchins stumbled toward the exit, the XO leaned over. “Think he’ll vote for the new jump gate funding?”

Elena watched him disappear. “Probably... knowing his lineage, or he’ll try to ban the whole program to appeal to his voters.”

“Which do you think?”

She smiled. “Ask me after he’s seen the pearl-strings. Nobody votes against something that beautiful.”

Outside, invisible to them but already beginning its four-year journey, the outbound light packet raced toward Proxima. Over coming months, it would pass through gas clouds, exciting atoms that would glow for weeks—a string of pearls marking their path.

And somewhere, borrowed from the dark energy field, a debt waited to be repaid.

Written in light.

Persistent and patient.

1qv82oc,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1qv82oc/what_actually_gets_people_promoted_quickly_and/,What actually gets people promoted quickly (and what doesn’t),"Not trying to be preachy, just want to share what I learned after years in HR watching promotion decisions up close. I spent 8 years in talent management and HR business partner roles at three different companies (startup, mid-size, and Fortune 500), sitting in literally hundreds of promotion calibration sessions where we decided who moves up and who doesn’t.

The common advice about “work hard and you’ll get promoted” is incomplete at best. Here’s what actually moves the needle from the perspective of someone who’s seen behind the curtain:

THE FOUNDATIONS (without these, nothing else matters)

Deliver consistently on what you’re given. This sounds obvious, but you’d be surprised. If you can’t nail your current job, nobody’s promoting you. But here’s the thing - “nail it” doesn’t mean perfection, it means reliable results with minimal drama. Managers promote people who make their lives easier, not harder.

Communication matters more than you think. The best individual contributor in the world won’t get promoted if nobody knows what they’re doing. Write clear updates, speak up in meetings with actual insights (not just to hear yourself talk), and learn to tell a story about your work that connects to business outcomes.

Build real relationships. Not fake networking - actual relationships with people across the organization. Grab coffee, help people with their problems, remember personal details. Your career advancement often depends on people you barely know advocating for you in rooms you’re not in.

WHAT ACTUALLY ACCELERATES PROMOTION

Solve problems your boss doesn’t want to deal with. Every manager has tasks they hate or don’t have time for. Figure out what those are and volunteer to own them. This could be:

	∙	The messy cross-functional project nobody wants to lead

	∙	Improving a broken process that’s annoying everyone

	∙	Taking on the difficult stakeholder relationship

	∙	Creating documentation or training that doesn’t exist

When you consistently take things off your manager’s plate, you become indispensable. And when promotion discussions happen, they’ll fight for you because losing you would hurt.

Make your boss look good. This isn’t about sucking up - it’s strategic. When your boss succeeds, they have more capital to get you promoted. When they present to leadership, hand them wins they can share. When they’re in a tough spot, bail them out. They’ll remember.

Think one level above your current role. Start doing parts of the next job before you have the title. This is huge and most people miss it. If you want to be a manager, start mentoring people. If you want to be a senior IC, start influencing strategy. Don’t wait for permission.

Own outcomes, not just tasks. Entry-level people complete tasks. Senior people own outcomes. Stop thinking “I did what you asked” and start thinking “I’m responsible for this business result.” Huge mindset shift that changes everything.

THE TACTICAL STUFF PEOPLE OVERLOOK

Document everything you do. Keep a “brag doc” or “work journal” where you track:

	∙	Projects completed with metrics (revenue impact, time saved, users affected)

	∙	Problems you solved

	∙	Initiatives you led

	∙	Positive feedback you received

	∙	Skills you developed

Update it weekly. When promotion time comes, you’ll have everything ready. Most people can’t articulate their value because they don’t track it.

Understand the promotion process at your company. This is critical. Some companies promote based on tenure, others on projects, others on politics. Figure out:

	∙	When do promotion decisions happen? (many companies have specific cycles)

	∙	Who makes the decision? (your boss, skip-level, committee?)

	∙	What’s the criteria? (get the actual rubric if one exists)

	∙	What level are you at versus where you want to be?

Then reverse-engineer your path based on that reality, not what you think should happen.

Have the promotion conversation early and explicitly. Don’t hint. Don’t assume your boss knows you want to advance. Say directly: “I want to reach \[level\] by \[timeframe\]. What do I need to demonstrate to get there?” Get specific expectations in writing if possible.

Visibility is currency. Your work needs to be seen by people who matter. This means:

	∙	Presenting at all-hands or team meetings

	∙	Sharing wins in public channels (humbly)

	∙	Volunteering for high-visibility projects even if they’re hard

	∙	Building relationships with leadership, not just your direct chain

I know this feels gross to some people, but invisible high performers don’t get promoted as fast as visible good performers. Reality sucks sometimes.

THE MINDSET SHIFTS THAT MATTER

You’re running a business called “You, Inc.” Your company is your client, but you’re ultimately responsible for your own growth. If you’re not getting what you need here, you might need a different client. This mindset keeps you from getting too emotionally attached to one company.

Promotions are about filling a need, not rewarding performance. Companies promote people when they need someone at that level to solve a problem. Your job is to make it obvious you’re the solution. “I’ve been here 3 years” isn’t a business case. “I’m already operating at the next level and here’s proof” is.

Fast career growth requires strategic job changes. Controversial take, but staying at one company for 10 years will usually slow you down. The fastest way to advance is:

	∙	18-24 months at a company getting promoted once

	∙	Jump to another company at a higher level with better pay

	∙	Repeat

I saw this pattern constantly in HR. The people who switched companies every 2-3 years advanced way faster than internal lifers. Each jump came with 20-30% raises. Internal promotions got people 5-10%. The math is simple.

Betting on yourself means taking risks. Volunteer for the hard project. Take the stretch role. Move to the new team. Switch companies when you’ve plateaued. The people who advance fastest aren’t the safest players - they’re the ones who consistently bet on themselves.

WHAT DOESN’T WORK (stop wasting energy here)

Being the “smartest person in the room.” Nobody cares if you’re smart if you can’t work with others or deliver results. I’ve seen brilliant assholes plateau while less talented people who collaborate well shoot past them.

Waiting for someone to notice you. Nobody’s watching your career as closely as you are. If you’re waiting to be discovered, you’ll wait forever.

Doing extra work that doesn’t matter. Not all work is equal. Staying late to make a deck prettier doesn’t help. Leading a project that ships revenue does. Be strategic about where you invest time.

Playing it safe. The people who get promoted quickly take calculated risks. They raise their hand for tough assignments, speak up with ideas, and aren’t afraid to fail visibly. Safe players advance slowly.

Loyalty without leverage. Your company will lay you off if it needs to, regardless of your loyalty. Be professional and deliver, but don’t sacrifice your growth out of misplaced loyalty to a company that sees you as a line item.

REAL TALK ABOUT POLITICS AND FAIRNESS

I wish promotions were purely meritocratic. They’re not. Politics matters. Some people get promoted because they’re connected, not because they’re good. Sometimes you’ll do everything right and still get passed over.

But here’s the thing - you can’t control the politics completely, but you can play the game smartly:

	∙	Build alliances with influential people

	∙	Understand who has power and how decisions get made

	∙	Don’t make enemies unnecessarily

	∙	Know when to fight and when to let things go

And if the politics are truly toxic or you’re being discriminated against, document everything and consider whether this is the right place for you. Sometimes the fastest path forward is out.

WHEN TO LEAVE VS. STAY

Stay if:

	∙	You’re still learning and growing

	∙	You have a clear promotion path with timeline

	∙	Your manager is invested in your development

	∙	The company is growing (expanding pie = more opportunity)

	∙	You’re building valuable skills and relationships

Leave if:

	∙	You’ve plateaued and there’s no path forward

	∙	You’ve been “almost promoted” multiple times with no results

	∙	The company is contracting or unstable

	∙	You can get the next title and significant raise elsewhere

Don’t be afraid to leave. The biggest salary jumps and title advances come from switching companies. Just make sure you’re leaving TO something better, not just running FROM something bad.

WHAT I SAW IN PROMOTION CALIBRATION SESSIONS

Since I sat in these meetings for years, here’s what actually happened behind closed doors:

The people who got promoted had champions. Their managers came in with specific examples, metrics, and passion. They fought for their people. If your manager isn’t willing to fight for you, you’re not getting promoted.

We compared people against level expectations, not each other. Well, officially. In reality, budget constraints meant we ranked people. The “ready now” folks got it. The “almost ready” folks got “next cycle” (which often meant never).

Visibility to leadership mattered way more than it should. If a VP knew your name and your work, you had a huge advantage. Unfair? Yes. Reality? Also yes.

Documentation won debates. When managers brought specific examples with metrics and impact, they won. Vague “they’re great” didn’t cut it. This is why keeping your own brag doc matters.

Most people were “not ready yet” for reasons they didn’t know about. The feedback they got was sanitized. The real reasons were things like “not strategic enough,” “rough edges with stakeholders,” or “we’re not sure they can operate at the next level.” Ask for the real feedback.

Politics and favoritism were real. I won’t sugarcoat it. Sometimes people got promoted because they were buddies with the right person. It’s gross, but it happens. Your job is to build enough of a case that politics can’t override merit. Or politics and merit align in your favor.

Your mileage may vary based on industry, company size, and luck. But these principles are pretty universal.",47,1770161585.0,careeradvice,19,0.87,False

1qv7usk,https://www.reddit.com/r/DailyDoseCoolFinds/comments/1qv7usk/spent_weeks_hunting_for_actual_savings_not_just/,"Spent weeks hunting for actual savings, not just affiliate noise: Here's my repeatable process for finding legitimate deals that actually save you money (saved over $300 on household essentials last quarter) 💸","You know that feeling when you see a ""50% off!"" banner, get excited, and then a quick check reveals the 'original' price was hiked up just for the sale? Or when a 'deal' is actually more expensive per unit than buying it full price from another store? Yeah, I'm tired of it too. I've spent years tracking prices and digging into what's *actually* a good value, and it's surprising how much real money you can save when you cut through the marketing noise.

Here are a few recent examples of what I mean:

*   **Tech Upgrade: 1TB NVMe SSD**
    *   **The ""Deal"":** Saw a popular brand's 1TB NVMe SSD advertised for $120, supposedly down from $240.
    *   **My Check:** A quick price history lookup showed it rarely sold above $130, and had been $95-100 just a month prior.
    *   **My Find:** Waited a week, kept an eye on a couple of sites, and snagged the same model for $92.
    *   **Actual Savings:** ~$28-38 compared to the ""deal"" price, and about 23% off its *actual* non-sale average.
    *   **Time Invested:** Maybe 15 minutes of initial checking, plus passive monitoring with a price tracker for a few days.

*   **Home Goods: Stand Mixer**
    *   **The ""Deal"":** A well-known kitchen brand stand mixer advertised for ""Limited Time Only! $299, Was $450!""
    *   **My Check:** This model frequently drops to $270-$300 during various holidays. The $450 'original' price is its MSRP, but rarely its street price.
    *   **My Find:** Held off, and two weeks later, a different retailer had it for $265 during a short flash sale.
    *   **Actual Savings:** $34 compared to the advertised ""deal,"" or closer to 40% off the inflated 'was' price.
    *   **Time Invested:** About 10 minutes of research, then setting a price alert.

*   **Daily Essentials: Premium Coffee Beans**
    *   **The ""Deal"":** My favorite local coffee shop was running a ""Buy 2 bags, get 1 free!"" promotion on their 12oz bags, which usually cost $18 each.
    *   **My Check:** Did the math: 3 bags for $36. That's $12 per bag or $1 per ounce.
    *   **My Find:** Remembered an online bulk retailer sold the *exact same beans* (same roaster, same blend) in a 2lb (32oz) bag for $28.
    *   **Actual Savings:** The ""deal"" was $1/oz. The bulk online option was $0.875/oz. Over a year of coffee, this adds up to significant savings.
    *   **Time Invested:** Less than 5 minutes for the mental math and a quick website check.

Now, don't get me wrong, this isn't always effortless. Sometimes a great price comes with slower shipping, or a specific deal might be regional. Stock can vanish quickly, too. It takes a bit of patience and knowing *when* to jump. But the point is, real value is out there if you're willing to look past the aggressive marketing.

In her defense she did send me some Instagram posts. We were 21. But she didn’t text me to hang out.

Time passes and I just removed her from social media. The last time we texted was around then. I thought I’d reach back out but she had a new friend group and I just got sad or felt maybe I was too clingy.

There’s a friend making app called bumble bff and I saw her account on there. I remember we matched on it around the time after we hung out. So that’s why we got each others socials.

Really paid attention to the roast profile I tweaked from the last time I roasted this coffee.  I got distracted and grabbed the already roasted peaberry instead of the  decaf I was going to roast.  Since the raw decaf is already kind of dark and the peaberry was a light roast it didn’t even catch my eye that I dumped roasted coffee into the roaster.  About the time I expected first crack I realized I was re-roasting the peaberry.  Went ahead and pushed through 2nd crack and dumped the coffee in the cooling tray.  It’s definitley a dark roast.  Fast forward a few days and I decided to try it and see if it’s totally ruined.  Surprisingly it was a good balanced cup.  I don’t care for dark roasts but this one had a bitter sweet chocolate taste and a clean finish.  I brewed it “aero-spresso” style using the pour control cap and pushing hard on the plunger to aerate the cup and create some foam.  Maybe happy accident isn’t the right term, maybe pleasantly relieved this very expensive microlot was a total loss.  

Lessons learned: yes you can re-roast a coffee and not totally ruin it.  Good quality coffee generally makes a good roast if you have a good profile.  Always be more deliberate when roasting different varietals with set up.  ",1,1770160963.0,roasting,0,1.0,False
1qv7t54,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qv7t54/working_on_my_31m_sobriety_while_feeling_judged/,Working on my (31M) sobriety while feeling judged by my partner (26F),"Hello Reddit,

Over the past few months, I’ve (31M) been going to therapy for the first time in my life and actually committing to it. One of the main things I’ve been working on is my relationship with alcohol. I’ve never gotten into serious trouble because of it, but I don’t like how it sometimes has control over me, and I want that to change. I have never wanted to be 100% sober, as I do enjoy a few drinks with friends. I have been very clear to my therapist, my girlfriend, and my family about this. 

My family has been very supportive, and I have a great therapist. Over the last month and a half, I’ve been genuinely mindful of my drinking and have cut back significantly. I know this isn’t something that gets fixed overnight, but I’ve been feeling proud of myself and much better overall.

Last week, my girlfriend (26F) went on a five-day catamaran trip to some tropical islands with friends. I was happy for her, even though communication was limited due to bad internet. When she got back on Thursday, I felt her distant. I invited her to a nice dinner on Friday to reconnect, but she seemed off during dinner and said she was tired from the trip. She also mentioned she had an all-day boat party planned for Saturday.

That felt a bit strange to me — if roles were reversed, I would have wanted to spend at least some time together after being apart. That Saturday night, I was playing music at a festival. I got her VIP tickets so she could enjoy it too. She seemed tired and hungry, and since money has been tight for her, I gave her $30 to get food and enjoy herself. I also told her I wasn’t planning to stay until the festival ended and would head home after my set.

She went off with friends while I played. When my set ended, she never came to see me or texted to check in. I assumed she was having fun, so I didn’t push it. I did have some drinks during the night, but I was very intentional about it — I had five drinks over six hours, which is a big change from how I used to drink.

After my set, my best friend and I left. I got home around 4 a.m. and had trouble sleeping. By 7:45 a.m., I still hadn’t heard from my girlfriend. When I texted her, she said she was at an after party. I offered to pick her up for breakfast or even just hang out wherever she was, but she wasn’t interested. I knew drugs were involved (her friends use ketamine), which isn’t my thing, so I let it be.

She got home around 1 p.m. I had just been at home, drinking coffee, having breakfast and waiting to make sure she got back safely. I went over to her place and suggested ordering food and resting together. As soon as I arrived, she accused me of drinking excessively and said I smelled like alcohol. I told her I hadn’t overdone it and hadn’t even showered yet. She said I was lying and started criticizing me.

I tried to explain that I’ve been serious about therapy and making changes, and pointed out that she had just stayed up all night at an after party, probably doing drugs, and I was not judging her or her actions. The conversation turned into me feeling like no matter what progress I make, it doesn’t count — while her partying is excused.

It’s extremely hurtful and confusing. I’m genuinely trying to improve myself, but I feel judged and dismissed instead of supported.

How can I make sense of this situation? I feel like I am living with a cognitive dissonance on this issue with her. If the roles were reversed (Me going to a 5 day boat trip, coming back, going to another boat party, going to a festival where she was playing and not even hanging out with her, then afters with substances until 1:00PM the next) I would not hear the end of it.

**TL;DR** I’m cutting back on alcohol and taking therapy seriously, but my girlfriend stays out all night partying and still judges me for having a few drinks.",4,1770160929.0,relationships,4,0.83,False

1qv7qah,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1qv7qah/i_did_not_hurt_them/,I Did Not Hurt Them,"Look, we have all fallen into the trap of doom-scrolling. Sometimes for minutes. Sometimes for hours. As a species, we have reached a point where every ounce of our day can be consumed by the small computer we keep in our pockets. I am no different than anyone else. I have succumbed to it more times than I can count.

But there is something evil within these apps.

I do not know what it is or how it works. Maybe it is a demon designated to me alone. Maybe it is an AI. Who knows anymore? All I know is that the other night, after a long day of work, I was lying in bed trying to unwind and scroll through reels.

Everything was normal at first. Car accidents. Shitposts. Memes.

Then, as I drifted deeper into the feed, I saw a video that made my stomach drop.

It was me.

I was sitting at the dinner table with my brother and parents. The table was set beautifully. My mother had cooked what looked like meatloaf, a meal she had never made before.

The video ran for ten straight minutes. No cuts. No dialogue. Just the four of us eating in silence.

When the plates were cleared and we began to stand, the video restarted.

I bolted out of bed and rushed to my parents’ room to show them. By the time I got there, my feed had refreshed.

How do you explain that to someone?

“Hey, I just saw us eating dinner on Instagram. That’s probably something to look out for.”

It sounded insane.

But I remembered the username.

I searched user.44603380.

Only one account appeared.

When I opened it, there were no posts. Just a blank page. Zero followers. Zero following. Everything about it looked grey and new.

Everything except the profile picture.

It was me.

A photo I had never taken. My face hollow. My eyes empty. Still human, but barely.

This was proof.

I showed my parents again. They laughed it off. Said it had to be one of my friends messing with me. I do not know why I expected them to understand. They are parents. Social media is foreign to them.

I reported the account for impersonation.

By morning, it was gone.

I went to work relieved, warmth in my chest.

That night, I repeated the routine. Shoes off. Bed. Scroll.

This time, a quarter of my feed was me.

Not really me. Versions of me. Walking a dog I never owned. Sitting in a library I had never visited. Every clip filmed from strange angles, like whoever was recording me was hiding.

I reported every account I found.

There were around thirty.

Each one disappeared.

I put my phone in a drawer and went outside. I did not touch it again until the next morning.

A notification filled the screen.

My account had been taken down for “pretending to be someone else.”

I appealed and went to work shaken. When I got home, the appeal had been denied. I would have to wait thirty days.

I made a new account.

It did not take long to find myself again.

Buying coffee. Getting gas. Talking to people I had never met.

Soon, my entire feed was nothing but me.

Too many accounts to report.

Then the videos changed.

I was no longer doing mundane things.

I was walking.

Every video showed me moving down the same stretch of road. A road I recognized. The one just before my neighborhood.

Then my street.

Then my driveway.

Then my front porch.

And then, as if nothing had happened, my feed returned to normal. Puppies. Nature clips. Advertisements.

Every account was gone.

Every video vanished.

I felt like I was losing my mind.

I threw my phone aside and stared at the ceiling until thought blurred into sleep.

When I woke up, I followed my routine. I got dressed. I made my bed. I checked my phone.

Hundreds of videos filled the screen.

Each one had thousands of views.

Each one showed me murdering my parents.

I exploded out of my room.

The walls were coated in blood. So much that they looked like they were leaking. The smell of iron filled the house.

My parents lay sprawled across their bed. Their torsos were riddled with stab wounds.

Sirens screamed through my phone.

On the screen, I saw myself standing over them. Phone raised. My face twisted in confusion, desperation, and terror.

Red and blue light flooded the room.

The front door shattered.

SWAT rushed in.

They pinned me to the floor. My phone skidded across the room and came to rest against the wall.

The last thing I saw on the feed was myself being handcuffed.

Then it refreshed.

Kittens. Baking recipes.

I was charged.

My lawyer insisted I plead insanity.

I am writing this from a holding cell.

Please believe me.

I did not cause this.

I did not hurt them.",5,1770160735.0,shortscarystories,1,1.0,False

Please stop rejecting me when I’m sending you my resume along with a cover letter that clearly explains my experience and why I’d be a good fit. I’m approaching you with previous experience, skills, and genuine interest, why is it so hard to be given a chance?

Instead of rejecting me outright, why not give me the opportunity to show you that I would be the right fit? I find this really unfair. When someone applies with previous experience, that should be a sign they’re coming to you with valuable skills to offer.

1qv7ne5,https://i.redd.it/xckj9pk44dhg1.jpeg,GIFTED RHODE PRODUCTS UPDATED REVIEW ❄️🤍,"Hi Rhode friends!! 🤍

I’m back again with my update on the upcoming products that are coming out on Feb. 9th! I was SO lucky to somehow get picked to be apart of the rhode testing panel for this launch!

To first answer the most FAQ: I don’t know how or why I got picked. I did not reach out and ask to participate, they emailed me! I’ve used rhode since the very first drop and have continued to buy as I run out and for new drops. I don’t think I buy a crazy amount, the email said for being a long time loyal customer, so I think they just picked customers who have continuously supported them over the years. I don’t have any secret for how to get picked 🥲

My updated (lengthy) review ❄️🤍

\- I received the products 01/21 and used them regularly since. I’m basically out of the face mask but still have some of the lip mask left.

❄️ RHODE SCULPTING FACE MASK (aka the caffeine reset)

\- I LOVE the cooling aspect. I said this initially but truly I love how cooling it feels when applying it. It’s so refreshing when waking up.

\- I truly do believe it helps wake up my skin in the morning and gives it that first step for a hydrated skin day, especially in the winter weather i’m experiencing.

\- It’s super easy to apply, it’s not too thick, but a nice light product.

\- It’s very hydrating and I think it goes great with rhodes goal of giving us hydrated skin

\- Leaves my skin SO soft and I noticed helping with that morning face puffiness with continued use.

\- I think the one con is (I personally) feel like it does need to be rinsed off but I’ve seen others say they rub it in. I think it’s a personal preference!

❄️ RHODE PLUMPING LIP MASK (aka Peptide Lip Boost)

\- THE MINT SCENT. I said it before and I’ll say it again; the mint scent has me sold for this alone. For me personally, ITS SO SIMILAR to the peppermint lip treatment. When I smell one and then the other, it is so so similar.

\- She is THICK lol but I don’t mind that. Not sticky IMO!

\- Has the slightest tingle feeling, nothing crazy. Didn’t leave my lips red or bothered like other lip plumping products

\- Feels so smooth going on my lips and leaves them feeling soft

\- I did notice the lip lines softening throughout use

\- Lasts forever! I’m loving putting it on before bed personally.

\- I think I noticed more of the hydration aspect, like with using it daily, my lips feel hydrated and smooth. So I noticed the hydration being more noticeable over the plumping but I did notice some plumping.

Overall thoughts: I love the lip mask over the face mask but I think they’re both great products. I think it truly depends on what you want when using skincare and what you feel your skin needs. I don’t know if either are essential in your skincare line but I think they are great additions.

I 100% plan on buying both products for the drop!

Please feel free to leave any questions and I will try to respond as I can! 🤍",8,1770160546.0,RhodeNotRude,0,1.0,False

Nag out pa nga ako sa family kasi I didn’t want to deny your identity. Luckily, they were so supportive about it. Pero alam ko naman na hanggang friends lang talaga, kaso you’re not just a friend for me.
