1owp0i3,https://www.reddit.com/r/specialeducation/comments/1owp0i3/inclusion_student_to_functional_student/,Inclusion student to functional student,"I work in a high school functional  classroom and I focus on work based learning and  my students are awesome. I’m also stretched so thin, I asked another FSC teacher to co teach with me because we have 1 aide between the both of us.

My principal and department head has decided transition an inclusion student to certificate track (okay fine) but then put them in my functional classroom for 4 periods of the day because 1 the mom wants him in 1 class and 2 because he has anxiety transition to his classes. This is not the best LRE, there is no data, and no one talked to me or my coteacher about 4 periods. They said he might be in 1 of my classes where I run a coffee cart 1st period for my teachers to teach him work skills. 

We have another work based learning class for the inclusion students and my department head bi he can’t be in there because “he just can’t” ,”he is better for your class because it’s easier and your just functional” .
Ummmm, my students work very hard in the community and my program is great that other schools are touring it asking for pointers .

I’m stretched so thin, Im so irritated that I have to revamp my entire schedule/curriculum for a student that  isn’t in his true LRE. “Well when he doesn’t show up for your class, you will need to find him”, how can I do that when my aide is at a job site, my coteacher is teaching and I’m at a job site… just soo irritated.",1,1763101201.0,specialeducation,0,1.0,False

I’m trying really hard to better my health and I absolutely have done so to a degree but I feel I could be better about it. 

I come into Starbucks every morning about 5 days a week. I love chit chatting with the employees and catching up and I like drinking my shaken espresso to wake me up. I realize just getting nothing or just a black coffee would be the best but realistically I can’t imagine giving up every single single thing I enjoy so I’m just thinking of ways to make it less calorie and sugar dense. 

I really like the oat milk but looking at that website it seems as tho oatmilk isn’t a good option for cutting back on sugar or calories. I’m not lactose intolerant but I do prefer to do a non dairy milk in my coffee. I’m not sure if you all use the same brands of milks or not but when oat milk was out of stock at my local shop one day I did almond milk instead and didn’t like it for some reason and I usually like almond milk. So correct me if I’m wrong but seems like the next best option would be coconut milk right? Since I don’t want a dairy milk. 

My current order has been a venti blonde oatmilk shaken espresso with 4 pumps caramel brulee, 2 pumps pecan. 

I’m thinking of switching to venti blonde coconut milk shaken espresso with 3 pumps caramel brulee and 2 pecan. According to the website that calorie checks your drink it would go from like 240 to 168 just by switching to coconut milk and doing 1 less caramel brulee pump. But I’m curious if the coconut milk works well in a shaken espresso? Any thoughts or suggestions? Thank you all. ",1,1763100818.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

# Courtney Sullivan awoke with the startling realization that she had been given a second chance—she was twenty-five once more.

Memories of her previous life flooded back: married to Tobias Monroe, a commanding CEO in New York’s ruthless business world, and living under the same roof with him and her mother, Greta Sullivan. Everyone around her had envied her marriage, whispering about how fortunate she was to have secured Tobias’s name and status. Yet Courtney alone harbored the bitter truth of her existence—a life steeped in loneliness and despair.

For years, she had battled a deep, suffocating depression, all while Tobias’s attention remained cold and distant. The neglect gnawed at her spirit until one unbearable night, overwhelmed by pain, she had locked herself inside the kitchen, turned on the gas, and let the darkness consume her. The root of all her anguish was clear: Tobias’s heart belonged to someone else—Jocelyn Campbell.

Courtney’s brow tightened as she recalled the inevitable meeting scheduled for today. She had anticipated Jocelyn’s request to see her and had already prepared the divorce papers, ready to sever the ties that once bound her.

The café where they were to meet was Tobias’s preferred refuge. Courtney could never erase the memories of him slipping away there to rendezvous with Jocelyn in secret. One fateful day, curiosity and heartbreak drove her to follow him. When she confronted him with the truth, his response was a harsh slap and a chilling declaration: “Whatever happens between us is none of your business.”

She had curled up in a corner of that very café, tears streaming down her face for hours, just twenty-five then as she was now. Only now did the full weight of reality settle on her—after all the years she had devoted herself to Tobias, he had never truly loved her. She had been nothing more than a convenient illusion.

This time, Courtney resolved, she would live for no one but herself.

With a determined frown, she pushed open the café door. The rich, comforting scent of freshly brewed coffee enveloped her, and her eyes immediately found Jocelyn seated quietly in the corner. Without hesitation, Courtney took the seat opposite her.

Jocelyn’s expression was cool and unyielding as she spoke first, “Toby loves me. Do yourself a favor—let him go.”

Courtney slid the divorce papers across the table toward Jocelyn. “Fine. I’ll let him go. But you have to make sure he signs these. Once the cooling-off period ends, I’m gone.”

Surprise flickered in Jocelyn’s eyes—she hadn’t expected Courtney to relinquish the title of Mrs. Monroe so readily. But Courtney’s calm gaze held steady as she continued, “Now that I know where his heart truly lies, I’ll step aside. Just get him to sign the papers. After that, whatever happens between you two won’t concern me.”

She took a deliberate sip of coffee, savoring the moment. This time, she would no longer be the fool—deceived, discarded, and broken.

Jocelyn’s brows knitted in suspicion as her fingers traced the rim of her cup. She glared, voice sharp with challenge. “What do you really want?”

“I want nothing,” Courtney replied steadily, meeting Jocelyn’s stare without flinching, a quiet sense of release washing over her. Then, rising from her chair, she turned and walked out.

The bustling noise of the café—the murmur of conversations, the clinking of cups—grated against her nerves as she stepped into the street. Jocelyn, sensing Courtney’s resolve, called after her, “You’ve made your choice. I’ll never give Toby back to you.”

Courtney didn’t even look back.

Jocelyn hurried out as well, pulling out her phone and dialing Tobias’s number. He answered almost instantly.

“Toby, can you come pick me up? I’m at Caffe Reggio.”

Just a traffic light away, Courtney stood watching, a faint, sharp smile curving her lips. In her past life, she had called Tobias countless times, but he never once answered. Now, as soon as the light turned green, he appeared at the café’s entrance.

She turned to see him framed by the window—tall, broad-shouldered, impeccably dressed in a tailored black suit. He handed Jocelyn a cake, leaning close to whisper something as he pointed to the extra blueberries—their shared secret, Jocelyn’s favorite.

Despite her resolve to let go, Courtney’s heart still twisted painfully in her chest.",1,1763100771.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

Sniper positioned three stories up, balcony to the right--two armed guards argue in the alley below. 

Eric hangs from the fire escape, gripping his custom Serenity Model VII. 

As he adjusts his grip, cybernetic fingers shimmer, a tell-tale sign of the optical camo he hopes the sniper won't spot. 

Towering skeletons glitch as they dance in the hazy neon air. 

Black parade floats decorated with white and red skulls blast up-beat music from above. 

Radio static crackles in his ear. ""Parades starting. Everyone's in position. Ready on your go, Eric."" 

Eric slides down the rusted ladder, his armored legs grinding out a shower of sparks. 

He hits the alley in a crunch of broken glass and slides shoulder-first behind a concrete barrier. 

The two guards--kitted out in basic security armor--still argue ten yards ahead.

""Your mother is--"" The butt of the taller guard's rifle cracks against the back of the shorter guard's helmet. ""What the fuck--""

The tall guard lifts a fist. ""Shut the fuck up--someone's here."" 

He brings his weapon to his shoulder, visor shining bright red from the parade above.

Eric doesn't wait--three shots to the taller guard with his silenced pistol. Two to the chest one to the head. 

The smaller guard nearly drops his rifle as he stumbles behind a dumpster.

Eric coils his enhanced legs, servos whirl as he retrieves the nano-filament knife from the holster on his chest--its edge glowing pale blue in the dark alley--and launches himself towards the dumpster. 

The world streaks in a smear of color; he lands, sliding behind the small guard. 

The small guard yelps as Eric locks his arm around his neck. 

He plunges the nano-filament blade deep into the guard's chest and twists with his pneumatic wrist, just to make sure. 

Eric wrenches the blade free in a spray of blood, letting the body thump to the ground.

Static crackles in his ear. ""Stop showing off, Eric. Miller's almost ready for his speech!"" 

The light on the small guard's radio flashes green against his armor. 

""Hostile spotted. Thirty-fourth street alley. Friendlies down, requesting back-up."" 

Eric flexes his fingers, dark green armor spotted with blood glitches as it stares back at him.

*Fuck.* 

A bullet snaps beside Eric's head, hitting the concrete wall behind--the sniper's scope glints from the balcony--he dives into the dumpster. 

Something slimy coats his fingers, he presses them against his temple. ""Mallory--armors acting up again. Where's Miller?""

Two more shots dent the inside of the can. 

The radio pops. ""You get what you pay for."" She sighs. ""Miller's approaching the elevator on the ground floor - five minutes, Eric.""

Eric pulls the pin from a smoke grenade and tosses it out of the bin--orange smoke explodes into the alley. 

He coils his legs and leaps into the orange haze, breaking into a sprint. 

His enhanced optics cut through, spotting a manhole cover which he tears from the ground effortlessly. 

Crossing his arms, he steps into the rancid pit, landing with a splash. 

Chunky brown water flows by his boots. The smell of piss and burnt shit smacks him in the face.

He presses two fingers to his temple. ""Any way out of this shit-hole?"" 

Mallory statics in his ear. ""Blueprint says forward then right at the second exit. And Eric--you're not stepping one foot into our apartment until you've showered."" She chuckles. 

Eric wipes at the toilet paper sticking to his leg. ""Noted.”

Filthy water laps at his boots as he wades through the sewers. 

He nears the second opening, something splashes in the water up ahead. 

He pushes himself against the wall, Serenity held close to his chest. 

He peeks around the corner, his enhanced vision targeting movement. 

Four green squares scurry towards his position--he readies the pistol.

Four large rats squeak as they run past Eric's legs--his shoulders relax. 

The radio cracks. ""Boss, we dealt with that sniper. Reinforcements surrounding the mayor as we speak."" 

Eric runs a knuckle across the scruff on his chin. ""Heard, Viper. Spot any gaps?"" 

Viper hums. ""Above. With the sniper gone, we can get the drop on him."" 

Eric fidgets with the pistol's hammer. ""They'll spot you. I'll approach from underneath. Keep your head down until I give the signal."" 

Viper clicks his tongue. ""Always gotta be the hero.""

Eric smashes through a steel grate with a kick and pulls himself through. 

The small room flashes with red lights, a thin ladder reaches up next to him. 

He holsters his pistol and yanks himself up the rungs--each step echoing in the tight corridor. 

At the top, a maintenance hatch blocks the exit. He pushes it with his forearm, opening it just enough to see.

Large servers wail in the dark room, as if mourning their life of servitude--a maintenance worker sips coffee at his desk, staring at lines of code flashing down the monitor. 

The door creaks open and an aggravated woman speaks. ""Why isn't the camera feed fixed yet? It's been out for three minutes, get your ass in gear!"" She slams the door behind. 

The worker sighs, muttering under his breath. ""You don't pay me enough is why, bitch."" He clacks at the keyboard, head hanging low.

Eric slowly pushes on the hatch. It squeaks. 

The worker snaps his head towards the noise. 

Eric smacks his pistol against the tiled floor. ""Say a word and your boss will be the least of your problems."" 

He pulls himself through and confronts the worker, who's now holding his palms up. ""I just work here man--no need to get violent."" 

Eric slams the butt of his pistol into the desk. ""Cameras stay off. I know who you are now--"" Eric lifts the name tag from the workers shirt with Serenity's barrel. ""--Martin."" 

A key-card labeled Server Room lies beside the keyboard. 

Eric snatches it and holds it to Martin's face. ""Will this access the podium?"" 

Martin's voice cracks. ""Y-yes, there's another server upstairs. The higher-ups use it for personal storage, I always thought it was a waste of resources, but they don't--"" 

Eric clears his throat. ""Thank you, Martin. Be good.""

The marble halls are mostly empty.

A robot whirls along, polishing the floors while Martin's angry boss huffs and puffs in her chair, watching cat videos on her monitor.

Cameras hang from the ceiling, a red light flickers on and off beneath. 

The elevator dings and the doors open.

Two sharply dressed business-men stroll past. ""Did you see Alice's ass today? I would love to--"" 

Eric slips by and catches the door with his hand. 

He taps the key-card against the black screen--*access granted*--and presses the twenty-fifth floor. 

The elevator hums to life, calming music starts playing.

Eric taps his finger on his holster to the beat. 

Static crunches in his ear. ""I hope you're enjoying the ride, because Miller's about to take the stage,"" Mallory says flatly. 

Eric presses his temple. ""You know my nerves start acting up right about now, let me have this."" 

Viper butts in. ""We've been waiting on your ass for nearly five minutes. Let's get this shit rolling,"" he hisses. 

Eric rolls his eyes. ""This isn't the first time we straddled the clock, let's just--"" 

The elevator stops at the twenty-third floor. Eric grips Serenity.

A young woman plods into the elevator, head hunched to the ground. 

She sighs and without looking at Eric. ""You ever have one of those days?"" 

Eric hides Serenity beside his thigh. ""Hmm? Oh, yeah. Totally."" 

She kicks the elevator door. ""What is wrong with men!?"" 

She snaps her head towards Eric. ""I mean, no offense, but... ugh."" 

The elevator dings at the twenty-fourth floor. 

""Anyways, sorry about that--"" She freezes for a moment. ""--you really stink, by the way. "" 

She pinches her nose as she walks into the office. 

Eric scratches the back of his head as the doors close.

The elevator opens to rain cascading down the bustling veranda, Eric wedges himself into the corner beside the door. 

News crews are held back behind velvet ropes as security keeps them at arm's length. 

The mayor stands atop the podium, holding an umbrella above his head, and he speaks into the microphone. 

""Welcome to our humble Day of the Dead celebration!."" 

The crowd's cheers are deafening.

""Such a warm reception despite our rainy evening!"" He folds the umbrella and tucks in under his armpit. 

""We remember the necessary sacrifices for the well-being of the R-K Sector's financial engine.""

Mallory chimes in. ""What a prick."" 

Mayor Miller checks his gold watch. 

""Now, let's raise a toast to their... contributions."" 

Miller raises a short glass of brown liquid. 

""I raise this glass with hope in my heart, that all of you will fulfill your purpose, for the greater good of our cities financial future."" 

He takes a sip. 

Eric presses his temple. 

""Now, Viper!"" 

Glass shatters from the mayor's hand, he stumbles backward from the podium. 

The crowd's gasps turn into screams as Miller's security forms a human shield, Viper's rounds sparking against their armor.

Eric is already moving. 

He dives behind a pillar as one of the guard's heads explodes; another fires blindly across the chasm. 

Eric lines up his shot, and the second guard crumples, a round between his shoulders.

Miller screams. ""Get these fucking insects away from me!""

A guard flicks his wrists, large blades shoot out from his forearms. 

He lunges, a silver arc aimed at Eric's face.

Eric pivots, the wristblades shaving past his chin, and in the same motion retrieves his nano-filament blade, plunging it deep into the guard's thigh. 

The guard twists, thrusting his other arm forward. 

The blade bites deep into Eric's shoulder before he can dodge. 

Eric rips his knife free and jumps back, his palm coated in slippery, warm blood. 

Eric smirks through the pain. ""Not bad for corpo-trash.""

The guard says nothing, standing as though he hadn't just had a blade six inches into his thigh, his eyes glow an eerie red.

Eric scowls. ""Fucking puppet.""

A well-placed sniper shot tears the arm from the puppet's socket. Sparks and blue blood spurt rhythmically from the wound.

Eric lunges while the puppet is off-balance, driving his blade upwards into its chin. 

The knife skitters off the hard exoskeleton.  
With a roar, he digs his boots in and shoves--the nano-filament steel sinks to the hilt. 

The puppet flounders as Eric wrenches the blade free.

Eric leans onto his knees, breathing hard. ""I hate... puppets.""

Miller has his foot on a dead guard's back, pulling at the rifle buried beneath. 

He spots Eric and pulls frantically until his grip gives out, sending him falling to the floor.

Eric kneels next to Miller. ""Don't worry. You won't die--yet."" 

Eric smiles, then smacks the butt of his blade into the back of Miller's head.

Eric presses his temple. 

""Target secured. Let's move.""

Would it be weird to message him on FB?,"Hi all, I (29F) recently went to one of my first local meetup group events and met this guy (?M) who I thought was really cute and really cool. I'm fairly introverted and was very drowsy at the start of the event so when he first introduced himself to my mini-group, a friend of mine and another girl we just met, I wasn't in full swing to be social. But after some coffee and shedding my introvertedness while going through an antique shop (as part of the event) and saw he was buying old hammers. A friend struck up conversation with him and when he was talking about being a blacksmith, I perked up. I already thought he was cute but is also into blacksmithing? That's pretty cool. As a fantasy/medieval nerd I started asking lots of questions, was super interested in what he does and we chatted for a bit. 

We got separated as it was time to go to the next meetup spot for lunch. As my little group was walking to the next spot, without him, a friend commented about how she thought she was witnessing the start of a romance from the interaction in the antique shop. That got me feeling pretty good and struck up conversation again with him. Somehow we got separated again and I was with my friends getting lunch and tried to be casual, uncertain about how to get him to join without being desperate. Eventually I didn't see him after a while and was pretty disappointed I didn't get to connect with him more. I'm pretty shy and I am definitely not ready to ask a guy for his number because I don't want to come off desperate. I also just got out of a long term relationship about 4 months ago and this was the first guy I actually felt a connection. I wasn't sure if it's too soon or what.

I didn't know I could connect with him after the event via the app I used for the event. My friend who had been there told me to try to chat with him on the app. I can't do it because it seems like he has the messaging feature off. He was easy to find in FB and now I'm all nervous about maybe messaging him there. I dunno if it'd be weird so I am asking here. Should I just shoot my shot? What should I say? Maybe he wasn't actually interested in me because he didn't ask for my number. Any suggestions would be great",1,1763100144.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1owolsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/FatFIREIndia/comments/1owolsp/father_wants_to_buy_a_coffee_plantation/,Father wants to buy a coffee plantation,"39M here — based in the US but slowly transitioning back to India to manage our family’s real-estate portfolio.

My dad (76M) has suddenly developed a strong interest in buying a coffee plantation after spending years vacationing in Coorg/Chikmagalur. I’ve tried talking him out of it, but he seems genuinely excited… so I figured if he’s serious, I should at least understand what it would take to make this viable instead of just a passion purchase.

He isn’t looking at this from a pure ROI angle — he assumes the land itself will appreciate — but I’ve spent ~15 years in tech + finance, so I’m wired to think about how to turn it into a business rather than a vanity project.

So I have a few questions for folks who’ve actually done this or know the industry:

1. How does one even go about buying a coffee plantation?
Is it just like buying any agricultural land, or are there specific due-diligence items (yields, shade trees, labor availability, soil quality, water rights, certificates, etc.) that first-timers usually miss?

2. What’s the ideal land size to operate a meaningful plantation?
For someone who wants a mix of hobby + actual output, what’s the minimum viable acreage? And what does land cost these days in the Karnataka coffee belt?

3. What sort of upfront investment (beyond land) does a buyer need to plan for?
Staff, upkeep, processing equipment, irrigation, pest control, etc. — what does that realistically come to?

4. What’s the expected ROI if done sensibly?
I’m trying to understand if this can at least be a cash-neutral or modestly cash-positive asset, even if not a high-yield investment.

5. If we don’t want to build a brand or go D2C, is there a reliable B2B market?
Can we just sell raw coffee (cherry/green beans) to established buyers or cooperatives? Is that a stable channel or a hit-or-miss market?

My dad is thinking of putting around ₹10 crore into this — partly as an investment, partly as his retirement “quiet life” dream setup. He’s a recently retired surgeon and would love a serene base away from the city.

If anyone here has experience with plantations, agri-investing, or specifically the Coorg/Chikmagalur region, I’d love to hear:
What should we know? What are the hidden risks? And does this make sense at all?

I (31m) went on a date with this girl (22f). We got coffee, had lunch. She seemed ok. She's extremely attractive. Like way attractive. Probably more attractive than me. (I'm probably middle ground. Idk) We talked about a lot of things. We have similar hobbies. Great texter. A lot of laughs. Not a fan of her politics, but whatever. She says she's monogamous. Wants to hang out regularly.

Things were getting interesting, so we headed back to my place. Took off our clothes. Got together naked. No sex. Just contact.

Midway through she asks me how many girls I've been with (sex). I tell her the exact number. (17 throughout my entire life.) I ask her how many guys she's been with... She's 22... She tells me a number WELL OVER 30 (I'm not gonna say it, but if you added like 20-25 to the 30, you're not that much over.) So... Let's do some math. At 22... Let's just say 30 (a fucking lie but let's lower the number for a sec to see if it makes it any better). 30 men since 18 is 30/4 = 7.4 per year. IT'S A WAY BIGGER FACTOR THOUGH. The real numbers and math come out like twice that. I'm trying to be nice.

Guys. Pretend you're dating a girl and she tells you she fucks 7 to 8 dudes a year since turning 18.

Edit: I should add the real point I guess. She was begging me to do it with her no condom. I feel like that may a sign of some serious immaturity going on, yet I also wonder if that's just normal.

How do you feel? What do you do? Is it good? Is it bad? Do you keep dating her? What's the conversation like? How bothered or not bothered are you? I need advice seriously.",1,1763099681.0,whatdoIdo,10,0.57,False
1owokdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropshipping/comments/1owokdi/i_was_checking_my_ads_40_times_a_day_and_tanking/,I was checking my ads 40 times a day and tanking my ROAS. One stupid rule fixed everything.,"For four months straight, I was that guy. Refreshing Ads Manager between customers at Coles. Checking it in my car before starting the engine. Rolling over in bed at 2am to see if my numbers changed.

My ROAS bounced between 1.2 and 2.3 like a drunk metronome. Then I forced myself to check once daily. Three weeks later: 3.4 ROAS.

March to May 2025: Maximum chaos mode

Revenue was anywhere from $8K to $12K monthly, but daily? Complete lottery. $600 one day, $140 the next. Zero pattern I could see.

Obviously my solution was to stare at the dashboard harder. Check between every task at work. Refresh during my smoke breaks. Last thing before sleep, first thing when my alarm went off.

9am: ROAS sitting at 2.1, looking decent.

11am: Refresh. Now it's 1.4.

Instant panic. ""It's dying. I have to fix this right now.""

So I'd mess with it. Pause the set. Copy it. Bump the budget down. Fiddle with targeting. Swap in a different creative. Turn it back on.

3pm: ROAS is 0.8.

Congratulations, I just murdered my own ad. But could I stop myself from checking again in an hour? Absolutely not.

The delusional part? I thought I was being a ""hands-on founder."" Like if I monitored it closely enough, I could bend the algorithm to my will through sheer anxiety and button-clicking.

Spoiler: That's not how any of this works.

April 17th: Rock bottom in a Coles parking lot

Worst week I'd had. Burned $890 on ads. Made $1,200 in sales. ROAS of 1.3, actively eating my savings from my day job.

Sitting in my car after shift, phone in hand, refreshing the page for maybe the fortieth time. My hands were actually trembling.

That's when it clicked: I'm not building a business. I'm just performing anxiety in public.

So I made one rule. The only rule that's actually moved the needle on growth.

The rule: 7pm only

Check Ads Manager once per day. 7pm. That's the whole rule.

No emergency checks. No ""I'll just peek real quick."" No phone refreshes while I'm supposed to be working.

What I actually do at 7pm:

Make coffee. Open the manager. Review the last 24 hours.

Three questions, that's it:

1. Any ad set spend $50+ with ROAS under 1.5? Kill it immediately. No second chances, no ""let's give it another day.""

2. Any ad set spend $80+ with ROAS over 2.8? Duplicate it, scale budget up 50%. Don't overthink it.

3. Less than 3 ad sets running? Prep 5-8 new creatives to launch tomorrow.

Takes maybe 15 minutes. Then I close it and don't think about ads until 7pm the next day.

The first week was psychological warfare

Days 1-3 were genuinely rough. I kept reaching for my phone out of pure muscle memory. Had to delete the Facebook app entirely because I couldn't trust myself not to check mobile.

Convinced myself my ads were crashing while I sat there doing nothing. The anxiety was worse than before, honestly.

But I held the line. 7pm only.

What actually happened:

Week 1: ROAS stayed at 1.8. Literally the same as my previous average. But I wasn't spiraling. Wasn't making panic edits at 11am based on three hours of data. Just answered the three questions and closed the app.

Week 2: Numbers started moving. 2.1, then 2.4, then 2.6. When I found a winner, I'd scale it and then just... leave it alone for 24 hours. Not checking on it six times to ""make sure it's still working.""

Week 3: Hit 3.4 ROAS. Revenue jumped from $12K to $21K that month. Same spend, same products. Only variable that changed: I stopped interfering every few hours.

Why this actually works

Facebook's algorithm needs time to do its thing. When you check at 9am and see 1.2 ROAS, that's not the final score. By evening it might be 2.8. But if you panicked at 9am and paused everything, you just killed a winner before it could prove itself.

I was my own worst enemy. Killing ads that needed a few more hours to convert.

Checking once daily means you're making decisions on 24-hour data sets instead of random 3-hour snapshots. Turns out that matters a lot.

Also killed my anxiety completely. Check at 7pm, make my decisions, close the app, go do literally anything else with my evening. Stopped living in that stupid dashboard.

My $50 days turned into $400 days. ROAS became predictable instead of a slot machine. The emotional rollercoaster just... stopped.

Current status: $203K monthly, still checking once daily

Most people think more monitoring equals more control. It doesn't. It means more panic and more decisions based on incomplete information.

Best thing I ever did for my ROAS was stop watching it every hour.",1,1763099632.0,dropshipping,0,1.0,False

I've always lived in really dense cities and as an adult have had fairly cozy 1-bedroom apartments, and as a child lived in a townhouse in my home city so I'm used to have a smaller footprint than the average person in my country (I'm American), but I never thought about deliberately choosing to live in a smaller space until this year.

There are so many different types of tiny homes out there from condos, to discrete standalone structures, to mobile homes. I'm curious what most-attracts you all to the Tiny Home lifestyle. Is it increased affordability, minimalism, coziness, or something else?

For me personally, it's about using my home as an intentional space only for sleeping, cooking, relaxing, and the occasional very small gathering. I plan to continue to always live in cities so I want my home to be just enough for my private life, but not something that slowly becomes the primary hangout for my friends, the primary place that I have coffee on a weekend morning, or the primary place I drink socially. I love the concept of a tiny home that leaves just enough space for my wife and I to have privacy, peace, and intimacy but not make it easy to configure it to act as a substitute for things we already have access to in our community.",1,1763099552.0,TinyHouses,1,1.0,False

The first time I had only seen her at a meeting and we didn’t speak, the second time we spoke to each other just a little bit, and the third time was at a training event where we did have a few conversations (it was a 5-6 hour event). At the end of the event, I asked if she was free the following weekend. She said she thinks she might be but wasn’t sure and asked why. I followed up by saying I wanted to see if she’d want to go on a coffee date on Saturday. She said she’s pretty sure she’s busy, and that was that. This was maybe 2 weeks ago now?

So yesterday I see her at the weekly meeting we do and all is well, didn’t really speak much but I lead the meeting so my presence was there you know. Later after the meeting, she posted on a discord channel asking for input on a graphic she was making. I messaged her on signal and gave her some information, and we started going back and forth about that, then some ideas for the groups Instagram, the the history of the group and how she’s impressed by us, then political stuff, then about running for office, which brought up our ages and how my birthday just passed and hers is coming up, and that we’re really close in age.

Obviously not much has happened here, but we’ve been talking back and forth over two days now and it’s been fun. When I asked her out and she politely said no, I thought about how I should’ve mentioned maybe a different time, but figured she would’ve if she was interested anyways. My wonder is if things continue on like this for a while and the conversations become more personal and frequent, can/should I ask her out again at some point, or was that my one chance and I should just wait for her initiation if anything does happen?",1,1763099251.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

Since childhood I've had frequent headaches and migraines. When I was younger I used to get zigzags and shaky vision before migraines, but the migraines mostly went away around age 11 - 12. 

I've continued to have near daily headaches in the same spot: right side towards the back of my head. When they happen, I feel an urge to clench my jaw. Lying down and taking ibuprofen usually helps, but the headache will sometimes return after I'm upright for a while. 

My physicals and bloodwork in the past have been normal, except for a mild omega-3 deficiency. My doctor usually recommends more exercise. I stay well hydrated (around 64oz a day) and mostly drink water, tea, and coffee. 

**Lifestyle factors:**
• Daily THC vaping (hash rosin/cartridges) for around 2 years but currently tapering down. 
• Several hours of computer use per day.
• Diet is mixed. I cook a healthy breakfast daily but eat unhealthy foods a few times a week.
• History of depression and anxiety. 
• Had covid a few months ago for the first time.

**New symptoms:**
• Uncomfortable tingling sensations on the left side of my head along with usual headaches. 
• Brief flashes of smell in my right nostril only (smells like dust + metal).
• These episodes are followed by a drop in mood, light-headedness, and feeling warmer than usual.
• These sensations come and go but my anxiety has increased which makes it hard to sleep. 

**Questions:**
1. Could these symptoms be related to anxiety/depression or withdrawal from reducing THC use? 

2. Are the smell sensations and tingling signs of a more serious issue?

1owo7z5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HerbalMedicine/comments/1owo7z5/how_tulsi_grounds_my_winter_days/,How Tulsi Grounds My Winter Days,"I’ve been using Tulsi (Holy Basil) in my daily routine for quite some time, and it’s become one of those things that feels good on every level. Now that winter has settled in, it feels even more grounding. It’s not just a cup of tea; it’s warmth, calm, and ritual all in one.

**Balancing Ritual**  
As the mornings get colder, starting the day with a steaming mug of Tulsi tea feels like a quiet reset. It doesn’t give that sharp caffeine buzz like coffee but instead helps the body and mind find their natural rhythm. On cozy winter evenings, I’ll often make another cup to unwind. There’s something about that earthy, herbal aroma that makes the season feel a little softer and more balanced.

**Stress + Mental Clarity**  
Tulsi is an adaptogen, meaning it helps the body adapt to stress rather than just covering it up. Over time, I’ve noticed I’m calmer, less reactive, and more focused, even when things get hectic. During the darker months, when the pace slows and energy dips, Tulsi feels like gentle support, helping me stay clear-headed and steady.

**Spiritual Side**  
If you’ve ever been around Tulsi plants in India, you know there’s something sacred about them. People tend to them with care, pray near them, and treat them almost like a member of the family. Keeping a Tulsi plant on my windowsill through the winter brings a little life and warmth indoors. Drinking the tea before meditation helps me settle in faster, especially on those still, quiet nights when the world outside feels hushed under the cold.

**How I use it:**

* Morning Tulsi tea to start chilly days feeling balanced
* Evening Tulsi infusion to relax and unwind
* A Tulsi plant on the windowsill to bring calm, green energy inside
* Tulsi oil in a diffuser during meditation for extra warmth and grounding

**Bottom line:** Tulsi isn’t about quick fixes. It’s about finding rhythm and peace through the season. In winter, it becomes more than just tea; it’s comfort, balance, and a small daily ritual that helps me stay centered when everything outside feels cold and still.

\----

If Morel held any ill will toward Luke after he suggested breeding and slaughtering her friends, no indication of ire was shown. The pair ate a simple breakfast of oatmeal with nuts, fruit, and coffee. Morel added several spoonfuls of honey to her tumbler of the black ichor, whereas Luke stuck to tried and true black.

  
The most remarkable thing about the breakfast was Luke learning more about Morel’s species. Not only were they large, but the square-cube law was displayed in full effect. Because of her size being thrice what Luke’s was, she ate nearly nine times what he did.

  
Over the course of only a few minutes, Morel had inhaled several pounds of nuts, fruit, and other snacks. With a rough calculation in his head, Luke estimated that Morel had taken in well over five thousand calories in a single setting.  

  
A feat that would have made Luke look like a glutton. But for her, she happily hummed and kicked her legs while eating, looking like a kid happily having been served a pint of ice cream. 

  
To Luke's dismay, there was no meat on the table or in the fridge for use. The closest approximation was soy bean patties, shaped like burgers, but in no way mimicking the genuine article. The cruel mockery of beef was white, spongy, and smelled like saltwater.

  
That Morel stocked such things came as no surprise to Luke, following Morel's passionate display the previous evening. Luke would have to either adapt to her food needs or start going to the dinner in town for his precious beef fix. 

  
After breakfast, the day rolled on. First on the docket was Morel showing Luke the feeding process for her little rabbits. It was an amazing display of training and care. Luke did not know what was possible for rabbits.

  
They had stepped out into the cool morning air, the shimmering dawn welcoming them. Dew glistened in the sun's gaze. Birds chirped and flittered across the sky. A gemstone example of the majesty of the Tobacco Root Range.

  
For a brief moment, as they stepped out onto the porch, it was as if all of Terra—no, all of the Sol system was still asleep, leaving only them to witness this splendor.

  
Morel wore similar practical clothes to those she had worn yesterday, tight jeans, and a bright blue button-up that still could not contain her bountiful bosom; the buttons screamed as they herculeanly held back the floodgates of her chest.

  
Luke, on the other hand, looked as if a thrift shop exploded on him. He wore shorts that extended down to his shins and a t-shirt that had halfway fallen off his body.

  
As he assumed the massive garments were more like a dress. The fluttering tapestry offered him little in the way of warmth. He shivered slightly throughout the explanation of the rabbit’s morning routine.

  
They walked around the fencing near the house, ensuring there was no damage to the border. Morel explained she was doing so because there had been animals breaking in and trying to eat her bunnies. The interloper had yet to succeed at devouring her friends, but she also had yet to catch the animal for relocation.

  
As she showed him the cage traps that had been failing her, Luke knew her plans' shortcomings at a glance. The trap was way too small to snare anything larger than a mouse. Especially if that fox who looked longingly at the rabbit cages the previous evening was the culprit. Even if that little omen of ill tidings was not the perpetrator, getting a larger cage would help. 

  
He noted that in his mind, it was another tool to buy for the farm. 

  
Once the perimeter was secured, Morel opened the cage for the rabbits. Each little fuzz ball was already seated in a neat line for her to release them upon the front yard. With a turn of a key and the creak of hinges, the small balls of deadly cuteness were released upon the mortal coil.

  
The half dozen rabbits swarmed Morel. She knelt to meet their jubilation. They jumped and patted her thighs. Each begged with small chirps to be the next one that Morel swept up in her arms.

  
The tall alien woman snuggled up to each rabbit in no particular order. She would set one down, say the next one's name in soft utterances of love and care, asking if they slept well before picking them up.

  
Morel spoke to each as if it were a person, with its own personality, hopes, and dreams.

  
It did not take long for the rabbits to notice Luke, but they gave him a wide berth as he placed food in each of their bowls, piling Timothy grass in each named bowl. The swarm of ravenous bunnies quickly attacked the bright pastel bowls, gorging on their breakfast like locusts.



“Don’t worry, they will get used to you,” Morel assured, resting her large hand on Luke’s shoulder, both watching the rabbits devour the grass.

  
“If they do, they do,” Luke shrugged.

  
“Well, I think you will love Button,” Morel said.

  
“Why is that?” Luke raised a brow, scanning the rabbits to identify Button based on the bowls, but couldn't make out the names past their fuzzy rumps.

  
“He reminds me of you,” Morel said, gesturing to a white and black rabbit at the far end of the line, already having finished his meal.

  
As the rabbit pattered closer, Luke watched and wondered what exactly about the creature reminded Morel of him. The little beast hopped up beside them. Nuzzled her hoof for a moment, then off he went to the far side of the yard, toward a waiting berry bush; fresh white buds were just beginning to bloom, and held the little creature's full attention.

  
“I don’t get it,” Luke said.

  
“He is very independent,” Morel teased, lightly bumping him with her hip in a playful manner, causing him to stumble and start falling to the ground. 

  
Morel's hand shot out and grabbed his flank, keeping him from falling. Her massive frame loomed over him. The light of the morning sun caused a halo to form within her golden hair; heat rolled off her body, causing him to sweat.

  
A smile grew on her plush lips as Luke began to blush from the proximity. “A lot like someone who has been taking and rereading his notes all morning.”

  
Luke’s face flushed cherry red, and he looked away from Morel, unable to withstand the intensity of her green eyes. But even while averting his eyes, he could still see them, feel them watching him intently, plucking apart every motion he made.

  
He scrambled away after his heart fluttered, escaping Morel's grasp like she was a burning fire. Warm feelings, like the ones he just kicked away, were not acceptable. He needed to keep his distance from not just Morel, but all women. They were nothing but trouble and would only cause him more heartache.

  
Morel stood up and chuckled. “Are you alright, sug? If I didn’t know better, I would think you had just fallen into an ant nest.”

  
“I’m fine. But can I borrow one of the cars?” Luke blurted out, trying to find his way out of whatever that situation was growing to be. “I still have to go get stuff for my tests and go pick out some new clothes.”

  
“Oh, alright. Lemme finish with the bunnies, and we can go get your stuff,” Morel said, turning around and starting across the yard to retrieve Button.”

  
“No!” Luke said, in an almost commanding tone, one that was far more harsh-sounding than he intended. “I can get all that I need faster without you.”

  
Morel looked over her shoulder in confusion, tilting her head. “What? But I can pay for that stuff. You are helping me after all.”

  
“It’s fine, I’d rather just head into town myself,” Luke replied.

  
There was a moment of silence in the air. Morel’s ears drooped slightly as she nodded. “You can use one of the old worker trucks. Keys are in their lodge, the beater is out back.”

  
Luke rushed away from Morel, like he was fleeing a burning building. He clutched at the oversized shorts he was wearing, and did not care that the t-shirt had slipped halfway down his arm, exposing half of his pale chest and back through the neck hole.

  
He quickly located the keys and the aforementioned truck and drove away from Golden fields and back toward Grey Rock. He looked into the rearview mirror as he crested the hill and saw Morel watching him, a look of bafflement and unease falling over her beautiful, soft features. 

  
He sighed and realized how insane he must have just looked from her point of view. The interaction they just had was friendly, and he ran away from her like she was getting ready to shoot him. 

  
But having such a close relationship was something Luke could not afford, especially rebounding right off a three-year relationship and a betrayal that could still cost him his freedom. 





The small bell over the door chimed; the sharp sound pulled the shopkeeper's attention from the television to the disheveled man stumbling in through the door. Sweat rolled off his brow and clung to his short black hair, along with whatever he had that passed for a wardrobe.

  
But Jose would certainly call none of those rags clothes. A loose shirt in a garish pink, with a faded teddy bear logo, and a pair of shorts that were so long he half thought them to be britches.

  
The only thing this strange boy was wearing that could even be considered proper clothing was his dress shoes. At least those were proper leather, but clearly not made for the rough life the people in Grey Rock were accustomed to.

  
The man took in a deep breath, shaking off the horrible midday heat as he looked around the store. Taking the stacks of jeans, workwear, and boots against the walls. He looked up at the cowboy hats and shook his head, seemingly disappointed by the offerings.

  
“Welcome, friend. Can I help yah find anything?” Jose asked.

  
“Yeah, I need some new clothes,” Luke said, stepping in through the door and finally closing the door, preserving the AC. “Full wardrobe, actually.”

  
“Full? Like shoes, trousers, and all?” Jose asked. 

  
“Yeah,” The man said, stepping up and leaning on the counter. “And if you don't mind, keep it simple.” 

  
Jose looked the man up and down, judging him, assessing Luke as little more than a broke vagabond. Jose let out a single huff, making his belief of how broke Luke was known, even before his following words were uttered. 

  
“This shop ain’t some charity. You can hike to Father Kars, if you need that,” Jose rolled his eyes and pointed to the door. 

  
In an annoyed response, Luke produced a chit slip and slapped it on the table. The prime, pristine ten-thousand note was worth more than any man's word. That was as much money as most men made within half a year, but this stranger could just toss it about. 

  
That did not mean he was a stranger, odd city-folk displaced, and certainly no vagabond. No, he was a valued customer. 

  
“Well, if yah wanna put it that way. Mi casa es su casa,” Jose smiled gesturing wide. “Let me get you fixed up, my friend.” 

  
Luke made no argument as the man selected a wardrobe for him. Jose had initially tried to get Luke's opinion on clothes, but found that to be a lost cause. Luke was clearly an academic. A man who cared not for fashion.

   
All Luke gave credence to was practicality, cost, and durability. Jose was fine with such a customer. His shop specialized in outfitting farmers and their hands. Practical, yet stylish, was the name of the game. Even if Luke did not care about how he looked, Jose would only send customers away looking stylish.

  
Jose did offer more, fine clothes, suits, and the like. However, his selection was sparse and did not offer the vast array of haberdasheries found on Mars or in more populated areas of Earth; as such, Luke accepted the wardrobe change Jose offered. 

  
Luke tapped his fresh cowboy boots on the deck, adjusting them with each thrap. He stepped out of this fitting room as a new man. Luke strode forth from the room. He was clad in denim and wool.

  
He wore denim bottoms and a wool top that clung to his lean, muscular body. A massive blank belt buckle shimmered, but would soon be dull. Jose selected plain buckles for Luke, assuming the city-boy would not care for detailed regalia. 

  
The button-up was simple, but it served its purpose, namely making Luke look like half a man, not some patchwork hobo. Luke initially leaned toward white, but was dissuaded from that color once Jose forced grey plaid upon him. Jose insisted that grey would be better, as it shows less dirt, is a thicker material, and was on sale. Luke especially liked that final detail. 

  
To tie it all together, and as a bit of goodwill, Jose gave Luke a good hat. It was not entirely out of goodwill. The black cattleman's cut hat was a rough fit for Luke. Another man had contracted Jose to make it, but the stranger had never returned for it; so the brand-new hat had been hanging behind the counter for nearly a year. 

  
Giving such a fine hat a home was better than it collecting dust. Giving Luke such a gift would hopefully have him return to the shop for future attire. 

  
“You look amazing, mi amigo,” Jose praised, adjusting the hat so it sat properly atop Luke's head. 

  
“It’s a bit different,” Luke said, looking himself up and down in the mirror.

  
“Ah, but the ladies will be all over you,” Jose replied, intertwining his fingers and jokingly fluttering his eyes. 

  
“Hopefully not,” Luke shrugged, walking over to the counter, his fresh boots clicking with command on the floor. “Set me up with another ten pairs of tops and bottoms. Oh, and a second set of boots,” 

  
“I can do that, amigo. But you know to break each set, right?” Jose asked while collecting a few shirts in a variety of colors and pairs of identical jeans. 

  
“No, I’m new to this,” Luke said, gesturing around the store. 

  
Jose did his best not to roll his eyes. That Luke had no idea what he was doing was plain as day. Asking that question was more of a warning to the outsider, not a genuine question. 

  
“Fair. So, just make sure to wear only one pair of boots for a week or two, let them stretch and mold to your feet. Then start cycling them.”

  
“I can do that,” Luke assured, paying for his new clothes. 

  
“Perfection,” Jose smiled. “So, where to now?” 

  
“I gotta go pick up some kit from the farming store,” Luke replied. “Just some basic soil testers.” 

  
“Well, if you are doing that. I gotta guess you are out of Golden Fields and are…Lucas?.” Jose asked

  
“It’s Luke. And what makes you assume that?” 

  
“It’s a small town, and Hank told everyone about you this morning at the dinner. Damn near everyone in town knows who you are.” Jose replied, gesturing widely around in a grand storyteller action. “The lone man from a far-off land, coming to aid the local beauty in saving her farm. It’s like an old western.”

  
“Didn’t most of those involve gunmen, not academics?” Luke retorted.

  
“Eh, probably, but history likes to rhyme. You might not be a gunman, but that doesn’t mean you ain’t just who Morel needs. And if what Hank was rambling about, your eyes certainly were lingering on that tomboyish beauty,” Jose chuckled, knowing very well how Luke seemed embarrassed by the idea from Hank's story. 

  
“I am doing no such thing,” Luke protested, “I’m just here to do a job.”

  
“Eh, whatever you say, amigo,” Jose shrugged as Luke took up his bags and started for the door. “Oi, don’t forget to come to the barbecue on Sunday. Morel never misses it.”

  
If Luke had heard about the event, Jose could not know. The chime of the bell had long gone silent by the time he finished the sentence. Leaving Jose all alone in the leather and wood-scented store. 

  
“Strange lad,” Jose muttered to himself, returning his attention to the television, the news cycle about to start up yet again.

1owo5o2,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1owo5o2/thoughts_on_inserting_moments_that_dont_affect/,Thoughts on inserting moments that don't affect the plot?,"Like the title says, what do people think about an author inserting moments between characters that have absolutely no value to the plot? For example, in a short story I wrote, there is a moment where a man goes for a handshake, but the other man is holding a mug of coffee and can't reciprocate. It turns into an awkward fist bump, and the MC is embarrassed.

The story is a short horror story about deer drowning in a man's pond, and the failed handshake does nothing for the plot, but does tell the reader about the two characters personalities based on the interaction. While it's fun to learn about the characters and their personality, the plot of the story wouldn't change if they were different people.

I've always thought that if something was fun to read then that, within reason, doesn't need to be important to the plot, but I wanted to hear some other opinions. While the story wouldn't be weaker if I cut it, I don't think it would have been necessarily stronger without it. ",2,1763098249.0,writing,6,0.63,False
1owo5o0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1owo5o0/i_made_a_deal_in_a_diner/,I made a deal in a diner,"   Something about a greasy old diner in a small town had a way of bringing me back down to earth. Maybe it was the ambience of the sizzling food in the kitchen combined with the clatter of plates on dilapidated tables. Perhaps it was the scent of warm coffee paired with the kind of burger you could never find anywhere else. Nothing fancy or even that good. Just warm and greasy enough to be comfortable. Maybe it was childhood memories of eating with my family at places not so different from this one. Whatever it was, there I sat, wishing I could sit in this cozy little vestige of Americana forever, or at least until my life got started, cuz it seemed like I couldn’t start it on my own.

   I grew up in a small town like this. I left for college, got a music degree, and found a job in retail. I’ve been trying for a few years to make music my job, specifically as a pianist. I’ve done some session work, toured with a couple local artists, but never found anything that seemed to stick, and for the most part have felt sort of lost ever since graduating. Now I was on my to a neighboring city to see about a job as a music teacher. It wasn’t exactly what I envisioned for myself. Then again what did I think I’d really be doing with a music degree? Featuring on a Taylor Swift top ten hit? Composing the soundtrack for Star Wars XXII? This though, seems like pretty realistic work for me. At least I could put my degree to good use. Still, it felt like I wasted so much time just for a measly teaching gig. I’d give about anything for a shot at something more real.

   I stared out the window while I waited for my food, watching the storm clouds gather over the small town. Before long the rain started to fall. The sound of the downpour matched the sizzling in the kitchen. It was almost enough to make me nod off. I heard the bell of the door ring, followed by footsteps approaching.

   “Scuse me sir,” said an upbeat voice behind me, “Mind if I sit here?”

   I looked up and saw a tall lanky man. It was an odd request considering that there were plenty of seats available, although all the window seats were taken by larger crowds. I figured I’d humor him. “Feel free,” I told him. He sat across from me and picked up a menu. 

   “Whaddya say?” He asked, “The burger, or the chicken fried steak?”

   “I couldn’t tell you. This my first stop here. But I ordered the cheeseburger anyway.”

   “The fried steak then,” he said folding the menu back up. “Oh waitress!” He called.

   “Ready to order hun?” said a voice behind me, only it didn’t belong to the waitress. In fact it was the same voice as that of the man in front of me. I looked up and saw the same tall, lanky man. Only instead of the suit the man in front of me wore, he was in the waitress’s outfit. I looked the man, then at the “waitress”, then back again. The man gave his order and his double left. I stared at the man dumbfounded, gesturing behind me, my mouth not finding the words to speak. So the man spoke for me.

   “I know right?” He smirked, “I really do pull off that skirt.”

   I looked around the whole restaurant. My jaw fell to the floor when I saw that every patron now had the same face as the man in front of me. “Who are you?” I finally asked.

   “My buddies call me Stan.” He extended a hand. “Are we buddies Martin?”

   “How do you-“, I cut myself off, it wasn’t as important as my next question. “Where do you come from?”

   “Down south,” he shrugged, “I’m not too popular in the Bible Belt though, so here I am.” His coffee was brought out and his took a sip of it and smiled. “I’ve been around a bit, but tell me Martin, why does no coffee compare to a diner cup with milk and sugar?”

   “What do you mean down south?” I asked, almost hoping he wouldn’t answer.

   “Oh Martin,” he raised an eyebrow. “Now don’t go and act all coy with me, I think you know.”

   I had an idea or two of what he was implying, but even after seeing all that I had just now, I needed a little more confirmation. Or I would if I wanted to hear this psycho out. Instead I ran to the door, but when I opened it, rather than a rainy street, I saw something that will haunt my dreams and my waking hour for years to come. An endless ashen landscape. A dark haze hung low, so that I couldn’t see the sky, assuming there was one. I heard a terrible sound in the distance. Voices. It sounded like thousands of voices shrieking and weeping simultaneously. I let the glass door close. The window still showed the rainy street side. That was more confirmation than I wanted. 

   “Sir, please don’t leave the restaurant until your check’s been paid,” said waitress Stan.

   I walked back to my table. Stan was slicing into his fried steak. “Yep,” he said, “I say y’all folks up north complain about global warming too much. I mean I’ve lived in heat you would not believe. And I got no a/c.”

   “Well what do you want with me?”

   “Not a lot really. I just thought I might be able to help you out a little.”

   “What with?”

   “What with? What do you think dipshit? You’re on your way to interview for a prestigious position teaching the grateful youth the art of music making all for an incredibly rewarding salary I’m sure. Or maybe you want more out of life.”

   “Of course I want more, and sure I’ve been floundering in my field for years, but I’m sure once I have some stability, I can find something a little more rewarding.”

   “Well I’m sure a driven focused young man such as yourself will have no problem finding that big break. But then again…” He looked at the door as the bell rang again. I watched as someone that wasn’t Stan walked in. He seemed familiar somehow. He was old, probably in his eighties. The way he spoke to the server sounded so close to home. It was me. He, or I, droned on about finally being close to retiring from teaching. 

   I turned back to Stan. “I know what you’re doing, but that doesn’t have to be me.”

   “No of course you’re right it doesn’t. But it is certainly possible. Probable even. Once you get into a bland but comfortable rut, it can be extremely difficult to escape it. It can be difficult to even want to. Do you want to want that life, Martin?”

   “No,” I relented, “I don’t. I really don’t. But that doesn’t mean I’d want to sell myself.”

   Stan laughed, “Martin, Martin, Martin! That’s not what I’m asking for no, no, no!”

   “Then what do you want?”

   “A shard.”

   “What?”

   “Just that. A small shard of a soul. So small you wouldn’t even notice it’s gone.”

   “And what would I get in exchange?”

   “Several years. Several years of success in whatever endeavor you pursue. You want to produce the next big hit? It’s yours. Play your own songs before grand crowds? You can. Still wanna teach? You can at the most prestigious universities, instead of babysitting inattentive brats. Whatever you set your mind to, success will come.”

   “At when the time is up, what then? Back to retail?”

   “Not necessarily. Your fate is entirely in your hands after that. Maybe you’ll be able to maintain your fortune, or achieve even greater heights, who knows Martin?”

   “All that just for a shard of myself?”

   “So minute you’d never miss it.”

   I thought about it. But not for long. After all, maybe I could make it in the limelight. If not, at least I’ll have gotten a taste of it. That’ll be enough for me.

   “Okay,” I said. “I’ll take it.”

   Stan smiled widely. “Well then, there’s only one thing left to do.”

   He grabbed a knife and gestured toward my hand. I opened it to him. I expected a slice at my palm, but he only pricked my index finger. He let a single drop of my blood fall into his hands.

   “Well Martin,” he began as he stood up, “It’s been a pleasure doing business with you.” He moved to the door and said one more thing before he left, “If you’re ever in need of assistance again, I’ll be sure to drop by.”

   He left. The real waitress returned with my order. It was odd, having the most bizarre experience of my life, then biting into a very ordinary burger at a very ordinary diner. Why’d I even choose to eat at a dusty old diner anyway?",5,1763098249.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1owo1sy,https://www.reddit.com/r/techiesgonemad/comments/1owo1sy/what_is_ctr_manipulation_in_seo/,What is CTR Manipulation in SEO?,"**Q: What is CTR Manipulation in SEO?**

Alright, let’s break it down like we’re chatting over coffee. CTR manipulation is basically *faking* how many people click on your website when it shows up in Google search results. You’re trying to trick Google into thinking, “Wow, everyone loves this result!” so it pushes your site higher in rankings.

CTR itself is super simple:  
**CTR = (Clicks ÷ Times your link was shown) × 100**  
If your site shows up 100 times and 10 people click it, that’s a 10% CTR. Google *loves* high CTRs — it assumes the result is helpful or interesting.

But here’s where manipulation comes in: instead of earning real clicks, some people **fake them**. They use shady tricks like:

* Paying random people on the internet (through sites like Microworkers) to search for specific keywords and click their link.
* Running bots or scripts that pretend to be real users searching and clicking.
* Using tons of different IPs (via VPNs or proxies) so it doesn’t look suspicious.
* Even asking friends or employees to search and click (yes, that still counts as manipulation).

The whole point? Make Google think your result is *so good* that it deserves to rank #1.

But here’s the truth: **Google hates this**. It’s against their rules — considered deceptive and spammy. If they catch you (and they often do), you can get:

* A **manual penalty** — your site disappears from search.
* An **algorithmic slap** — rankings tank overnight.
* Wasted money on fake clicks that don’t convert.

The smart (and safe) way? Actually *earn* better clicks:

* Write titles that make people go “I NEED to click that!” (think curiosity, numbers, urgency).
* Make your meta description sound like a mini ad — clear benefit, call to action.
* Add star ratings, FAQs, or prices using schema markup so your result stands out.
* Test different headlines like you would with ads.

Bottom line: CTR manipulation is like cheating on a test. Might work short-term, but when you get caught? Game over. Real wins come from making your result genuinely click-worthy.",1,1763097885.0,techiesgonemad,2,1.0,False

When *Maria* lost her front tooth after an unexpected accident, she felt her confidence vanish along with it. She stopped smiling in photos, avoided conversations, and even hesitated to meet friends for coffee. But everything changed when she discovered [**Dental Implants in Hicksville**](https://www.drphildds.com/dental-implants/) — a permanent, natural-looking solution that didn’t just replace her tooth but revived her confidence and joy.

Her story is one shared by countless others who have found a second chance at smiling, laughing, and living freely again through the artistry and precision of implant dentistry.

**Why Choose Dental Implants in Hicksville?**

Dental implants are the gold standard for tooth replacement. Unlike dentures or bridges, they don’t just sit on your gums — they integrate with your jawbone, creating a secure, lifelong foundation for new teeth.

Here’s why more patients in Hicksville are choosing implants:

* 🦷 **Natural Look & Feel:** Implants mimic real teeth in both function and appearance.
* 💪 **Durability:** With proper care, implants can last a lifetime.
* 😁 **Confidence Boost:** No more slipping dentures or hiding your smile.
* 🍎 **Better Oral Health:** They preserve bone density and prevent jaw deterioration.

At [**Dr. Philip M. Tornatore, DDS**](https://www.drphildds.com/)**,** patients receive personalized implant care tailored to their unique needs. With years of expertise in restorative and cosmetic dentistry, Dr. Tornatore’s practice combines advanced technology with compassionate service — because every smile deserves expert attention and genuine care.

**The Dental Implant Process: Step by Step**

1. **Consultation and Evaluation** Your journey begins with a detailed assessment, including X-rays and a smile analysis to determine candidacy.
2. **Implant Placement** The titanium post — acting as your tooth’s new root — is gently inserted into your jawbone.
3. **Healing and Integration** Over the next few months, your bone naturally bonds with the implant in a process called *osseointegration*.
4. **Crown Placement** Finally, a custom-designed crown is attached, completing your new, natural-looking tooth.

Each step is handled with precision and care, ensuring your comfort and satisfaction from consultation to completion.

**A Real-Life Smile Transformation**

When *James*, a local teacher, came in with several missing molars, eating and speaking had become a daily struggle. “I used to cover my mouth when I laughed,” he shared. After receiving [**Dental Implants in Hicksville**](https://www.drphildds.com/dental-implants-in-nassau-county-restoring-your-smile-with-dr-phil-dds/), his transformation was remarkable — not only in his smile but in his entire demeanor. He regained his confidence, started smiling freely again, and even said, “It feels like I’ve got my life back.”

That’s the true power of a well-crafted implant — it doesn’t just fill a space in your mouth; it fills a void in your spirit.

**FAQs About Dental Implants**

**1. Are dental implants painful?**  
Most patients report minimal discomfort. The procedure is performed under local anesthesia, and recovery is typically smooth.

**2. How long do dental implants last?**  
With proper care and regular check-ups, implants can last 25 years or even a lifetime.

**3. Can anyone get dental implants?**  
Most adults in good health with sufficient bone density are eligible candidates.

**4. How do I care for my implants?**  
Just like natural teeth — brush, floss, and schedule regular cleanings.

**5. How long does the full process take?**  
From consultation to final placement, it may take several months, depending on healing and customization.

**A Smile That Lasts a Lifetime**

Whether it’s one tooth or several, the right dental implant can change everything — your comfort, your confidence, and the way you connect with others. At Dr. Philip M. Tornatore, DDS, every smile restoration is a blend of science, precision, and heart.

I moved back to my home state last month and have been living at my rents place where they have a Aiden fellow which has obviously been awesome. 

Ive been slowly moving into my new apartment and have been thinking about what type of coffee maker to get with Black Friday deals are around the corner. I do have a pourover but I get up at 5 am for work a lot and simply hitting a button in the morning is much easier than doing the whole pourover process when I’m trying to get out the door.

With that said I’ve been looking at the oxo and simply brew coffee maker, and less so (due to price) but also the ratio 6 and mocha master. I don’t need anything crazy but the Aiden fellow has spoiled me a little.

I also need a grinder and am thinking of grabbing a secondhand burr grinder (cuisinart and oxo show up on Facebook around me a lot). 

Whats your guys’ suggestions for a solid cup of joe where I can wake up, press the button, small volume batch (2-3 cups), to put immediately into a to go cup. I don’t need any type of customization or anything like that the simpler the better tbh. If I want to mess around on a lazy Sunday morning I’ve got the pourover to experiment with.

Thanks for any insight!

I watched as someone that wasn’t Stan walked in. He seemed familiar somehow. He was old, probably in his eighties. The way he spoke to the server sounded so close to home. It was me. He, or I, droned on about finally being close to retiring from teaching. 

   I turned back to Stan. “I know what you’re doing, but that doesn’t have to be me.”

   “No of course you’re right it doesn’t. But it is certainly possible. Probable even. Once you get into a bland but comfortable rut, it can be extremely difficult to escape it. It can be difficult to even want to. Do you want to want that life, Martin?”

   “No,” I relented, “I don’t. I really don’t. But that doesn’t mean I’d want to sell myself.”

   Stan laughed, “Martin, Martin, Martin! That’s not what I’m asking for no, no, no!”

   “Then what do you want?”

   “A shard.”

   “What?”

   “Just that. A small shard of a soul. So small you wouldn’t even notice it’s gone.”

   “And what would I get in exchange?”

   “Several years. Several years of success in whatever endeavor you pursue. You want to produce the next big hit? It’s yours. Play your own songs before grand crowds? You can. Still wanna teach? You can at the most prestigious universities, instead of babysitting inattentive brats. Whatever you set your mind to, success will come.”

   “At when the time is up, what then? Back to retail?”

   “Not necessarily. Your fate is entirely in your hands after that. Maybe you’ll be able to maintain your fortune, or achieve even greater heights, who knows Martin?”

   “All that just for a shard of myself?”

   “So minute you’d never miss it.”

   I thought about it. But not for long. After all, maybe I could make it in the limelight. If not, at least I’ll have gotten a taste of it. That’ll be enough for me.

   “Okay,” I said. “I’ll take it.”

   Stan smiled widely. “Well then, there’s only one thing left to do.”

   He grabbed a knife and gestured toward my hand. I opened it to him. I expected a slice at my palm, but he only pricked my index finger. He let a single drop of my blood fall into his hands.

   “Well Martin,” he began as he stood up, “It’s been a pleasure doing business with you.” He moved to the door and said one more thing before he left, “If you’re ever in need of assistance again, I’ll be sure to drop by.”

   He left. The real waitress returned with my order. It was odd, having the most bizarre experience of my life, then biting into a very ordinary burger at a very ordinary diner. Why’d I even choose to eat at a dusty old diner anyway?",2,1763097286.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

This sub is such a cool resource. There’s so much knowledge here. Thank you to everyone who is so helpful to us beginners.

I recently made my first very bad cup. Here’s the set up. Help me please!

Dune Presidio Decaf Hario Switch 03 with hario filter 95C water CC recipe 18g in 288g out 1zpresso X-Ultra at 2.3

andddd lots of stalling (brew took almost 5 minutes most of that wasthe final drawdown phase.)

The cup was very bitter and had a chalky lingering mouthfeel.

I feel like this coffee produces way more fines? Could that be true? It’s pretty dark compared to everything I’ve roasted. Also, I feel like I’m pouring really high because the switch 03 is so tall. Would a mellow drip help? How do you avoid stalling with such a big brewer?

To give a little context I (28 M) and my gf (26 F) have been dating for 7 months. We are both recovering addicts and alcoholics. I have 10 years clean and she was just about to hit 5 months clean. The first 2 months of the relationship I know most people will ask why I chose to stay. But I believed that everyone deserves to have someone fully choose them and we bonded very fast. Though it was filled with constant relapses and 2am drives to pick her up from questionable areas. And a lot of trauma that I don’t feel is right to dump here. 

 I decided that it was best if we got a fresh start and talked to her about moving cities. Where we moved to a new city a month and a half ago, neither one of us know anyone. Honestly hoping for an easy life away from the addiction and the trigger areas. Well I got a basement suite and have been stressing myself out like crazy to provide and make sure that everything is catered to her. She is treated like an absolute princess, breakfast in bed every morning with coffee, dinner lunch snacks all home cooked. I even plan and make every day filled so she doesn’t get bored. Now she does make me very happy and she does do things around the place. Laundry and cleaning and such so Its pretty even. 

 Yesterday she decided to order alcohol, And relapsed. Not to get too detailed on that portion as I choose to leave that in the past. However I decided I was done and wasn’t going to be living looking over my shoulder making sure she was perfectly fine 100% of the time. I couldn’t trust her anymore. The lies and the deceit, the hurt and the pain I’ve been put through. I got her a one way bus right back to the city we moved from, to stay with her sister. Even though I know she might not stay sober. My hope is that she will find a reason to be sober for herself and not put it all on me that she stays sober. But I feel like I’m the asshole for not just putting up with it and giving her another grace, instead sending her back into the vipers den to face it alone. Am I the asshole? Or did I make a fair decision on sending her back? I am wracked with guilt and my heart is aching over this decision. Thank you

1ownrqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ownrqs/neon_puppets/,Neon Puppets,"Sniper positioned three stories up, balcony to the right--two armed guards argue in the alley below. 

Eric hangs from the fire escape, gripping his custom Serenity Model VII. 

As he adjusts his grip, cybernetic fingers shimmer, a tell-tale sign of the optical camo he hopes the sniper won't spot. 

Towering skeletons glitch as they dance in the hazy neon air. 

Black parade floats decorated with white and red skulls blast up-beat music from above. 

Radio static crackles in his ear. ""Parades starting. Everyone's in position. Ready on your go, Eric."" 

Eric slides down the rusted ladder, his armored legs grinding out a shower of sparks. 

He hits the alley in a crunch of broken glass and slides shoulder-first behind a concrete barrier. 

The two guards--kitted out in basic security armor--still argue ten yards ahead.

""Your mother is--"" The butt of the taller guard's rifle cracks against the back of the shorter guard's helmet. ""What the fuck--""

The tall guard lifts a fist. ""Shut the fuck up--someone's here."" 

He brings his weapon to his shoulder, visor shining bright red from the parade above.

Eric doesn't wait--three shots to the taller guard with his silenced pistol. Two to the chest one to the head. 

The smaller guard nearly drops his rifle as he stumbles behind a dumpster.

Eric coils his enhanced legs, servos whirl as he retrieves the nano-filament knife from the holster on his chest--its edge glowing pale blue in the dark alley--and launches himself towards the dumpster. 

The world streaks in a smear of color; he lands, sliding behind the small guard. 

The small guard yelps as Eric locks his arm around his neck. 

He plunges the nano-filament blade deep into the guard's chest and twists with his pneumatic wrist, just to make sure. 

Eric wrenches the blade free in a spray of blood, letting the body thump to the ground.

Static crackles in his ear. ""Stop showing off, Eric. Miller's almost ready for his speech!"" 

The light on the small guard's radio flashes green against his armor. 

""Hostile spotted. Thirty-fourth street alley. Friendlies down, requesting back-up."" 

Eric flexes his fingers, dark green armor spotted with blood glitches as it stares back at him.

*Fuck.* 

A bullet snaps beside Eric's head, hitting the concrete wall behind--the sniper's scope glints from the balcony--he dives into the dumpster. 

Something slimy coats his fingers, he presses them against his temple. ""Mallory--armors acting up again. Where's Miller?""

Two more shots dent the inside of the can. 

The radio pops. ""You get what you pay for."" She sighs. ""Miller's approaching the elevator on the ground floor - five minutes, Eric.""

Eric pulls the pin from a smoke grenade and tosses it out of the bin--orange smoke explodes into the alley. 

He coils his legs and leaps into the orange haze, breaking into a sprint. 

His enhanced optics cut through, spotting a manhole cover which he tears from the ground effortlessly. 

Crossing his arms, he steps into the rancid pit, landing with a splash. 

Chunky brown water flows by his boots. The smell of piss and burnt shit smacks him in the face.

He presses two fingers to his temple. ""Any way out of this shit-hole?"" 

Mallory statics in his ear. ""Blueprint says forward then right at the second exit. And Eric--you're not stepping one foot into our apartment until you've showered."" She chuckles. 

Eric wipes at the toilet paper sticking to his leg. ""Noted.”

Filthy water laps at his boots as he wades through the sewers. 

He nears the second opening, something splashes in the water up ahead. 

He pushes himself against the wall, Serenity held close to his chest. 

He peeks around the corner, his enhanced vision targeting movement. 

Four green squares scurry towards his position--he readies the pistol.

Four large rats squeak as they run past Eric's legs--his shoulders relax. 

The radio cracks. ""Boss, we dealt with that sniper. Reinforcements surrounding the mayor as we speak."" 

Eric runs a knuckle across the scruff on his chin. ""Heard, Viper. Spot any gaps?"" 

Viper hums. ""Above. With the sniper gone, we can get the drop on him."" 

Eric fidgets with the pistol's hammer. ""They'll spot you. I'll approach from underneath. Keep your head down until I give the signal."" 

Viper clicks his tongue. ""Always gotta be the hero.""

Eric smashes through a steel grate with a kick and pulls himself through. 

The small room flashes with red lights, a thin ladder reaches up next to him. 

He holsters his pistol and yanks himself up the rungs--each step echoing in the tight corridor. 

At the top, a maintenance hatch blocks the exit. He pushes it with his forearm, opening it just enough to see.

Large servers wail in the dark room, as if mourning their life of servitude--a maintenance worker sips coffee at his desk, staring at lines of code flashing down the monitor. 

The door creaks open and an aggravated woman speaks. ""Why isn't the camera feed fixed yet? It's been out for three minutes, get your ass in gear!"" She slams the door behind. 

The worker sighs, muttering under his breath. ""You don't pay me enough is why, bitch."" He clacks at the keyboard, head hanging low.

Eric slowly pushes on the hatch. It squeaks. 

The worker snaps his head towards the noise. 

Eric smacks his pistol against the tiled floor. ""Say a word and your boss will be the least of your problems."" 

He pulls himself through and confronts the worker, who's now holding his palms up. ""I just work here man--no need to get violent."" 

Eric slams the butt of his pistol into the desk. ""Cameras stay off. I know who you are now--"" Eric lifts the name tag from the workers shirt with Serenity's barrel. ""--Martin."" 

A key-card labeled Server Room lies beside the keyboard. 

Eric snatches it and holds it to Martin's face. ""Will this access the podium?"" 

Martin's voice cracks. ""Y-yes, there's another server upstairs. The higher-ups use it for personal storage, I always thought it was a waste of resources, but they don't--"" 

Eric clears his throat. ""Thank you, Martin. Be good.""

The marble halls are mostly empty.

A robot whirls along, polishing the floors while Martin's angry boss huffs and puffs in her chair, watching cat videos on her monitor.

Cameras hang from the ceiling, a red light flickers on and off beneath. 

The elevator dings and the doors open.

Two sharply dressed business-men stroll past. ""Did you see Alice's ass today? I would love to--"" 

Eric slips by and catches the door with his hand. 

He taps the key-card against the black screen--*access granted*--and presses the twenty-fifth floor. 

The elevator hums to life, calming music starts playing.

Eric taps his finger on his holster to the beat. 

Static crunches in his ear. ""I hope you're enjoying the ride, because Miller's about to take the stage,"" Mallory says flatly. 

Eric presses his temple. ""You know my nerves start acting up right about now, let me have this."" 

Viper butts in. ""We've been waiting on your ass for nearly five minutes. Let's get this shit rolling,"" he hisses. 

Eric rolls his eyes. ""This isn't the first time we straddled the clock, let's just--"" 

The elevator stops at the twenty-third floor. Eric grips Serenity.

A young woman plods into the elevator, head hunched to the ground. 

She sighs and without looking at Eric. ""You ever have one of those days?"" 

Eric hides Serenity beside his thigh. ""Hmm? Oh, yeah. Totally."" 

She kicks the elevator door. ""What is wrong with men!?"" 

She snaps her head towards Eric. ""I mean, no offense, but... ugh."" 

The elevator dings at the twenty-fourth floor. 

""Anyways, sorry about that--"" She freezes for a moment. ""--you really stink, by the way. "" 

She pinches her nose as she walks into the office. 

Eric scratches the back of his head as the doors close.

The elevator opens to rain cascading down the bustling veranda, Eric wedges himself into the corner beside the door. 

News crews are held back behind velvet ropes as security keeps them at arm's length. 

The mayor stands atop the podium, holding an umbrella above his head, and he speaks into the microphone. 

""Welcome to our humble Day of the Dead celebration!."" 

The crowd's cheers are deafening.

""Such a warm reception despite our rainy evening!"" He folds the umbrella and tucks in under his armpit. 

""We remember the necessary sacrifices for the well-being of the R-K Sector's financial engine.""

Mallory chimes in. ""What a prick."" 

Mayor Miller checks his gold watch. 

""Now, let's raise a toast to their... contributions."" 

Miller raises a short glass of brown liquid. 

""I raise this glass with hope in my heart, that all of you will fulfill your purpose, for the greater good of our cities financial future."" 

He takes a sip. 

Eric presses his temple. 

""Now, Viper!"" 

Glass shatters from the mayor's hand, he stumbles backward from the podium. 

The crowd's gasps turn into screams as Miller's security forms a human shield, Viper's rounds sparking against their armor.

Eric is already moving. 

He dives behind a pillar as one of the guard's heads explodes; another fires blindly across the chasm. 

Eric lines up his shot, and the second guard crumples, a round between his shoulders.

Miller screams. ""Get these fucking insects away from me!""

A guard flicks his wrists, large blades shoot out from his forearms. 

He lunges, a silver arc aimed at Eric's face.

Eric pivots, the wristblades shaving past his chin, and in the same motion retrieves his nano-filament blade, plunging it deep into the guard's thigh. 

The guard twists, thrusting his other arm forward. 

The blade bites deep into Eric's shoulder before he can dodge. 

Eric rips his knife free and jumps back, his palm coated in slippery, warm blood. 

Eric smirks through the pain. ""Not bad for corpo-trash.""

The guard says nothing, standing as though he hadn't just had a blade six inches into his thigh, his eyes glow an eerie red.

Eric scowls. ""Fucking puppet.""

A well-placed sniper shot tears the arm from the puppet's socket. Sparks and blue blood spurt rhythmically from the wound.

Eric lunges while the puppet is off-balance, driving his blade upwards into its chin. 

The knife skitters off the hard exoskeleton.  
With a roar, he digs his boots in and shoves--the nano-filament steel sinks to the hilt. 

The puppet flounders as Eric wrenches the blade free.

Eric leans onto his knees, breathing hard. ""I hate... puppets.""

Miller has his foot on a dead guard's back, pulling at the rifle buried beneath. 

He spots Eric and pulls frantically until his grip gives out, sending him falling to the floor.

Eric kneels next to Miller. ""Don't worry. You won't die--yet."" 

Eric smiles, then smacks the butt of his blade into the back of Miller's head.

Eric presses his temple. 

""Target secured. Let's move.""",4,1763096980.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Most morning I place an online order at a coffee shop that is on my way to work, and stop and pick it up. I pull up to the coffee shop, and at first park in a handicap parking spot (subtle foreshadowing). I notice the sign that is on the building in front of the spot saying it was a handicap spot. I pull out and park in a spot 3 spots away that does not have a sign in front of it. I get out of my car grab my order, and as I’m walking to my car the lady walking by says something along the lines of “handicap spot, you’re disgusting”. My first reaction was…she’s kidding. I thought she saw that I originally parked in a handicap spot, and pulled out of it to park in the spot I’m in now and she was joking with me. But no. I was in a handicap spot. There wasn’t a sign in front of the spot I was in, but there was the handicap logo painted on the actual spot itself that I completely missed. Once I realized what I did I tell this lady that I’m so sorry and it was an accident and I didn’t realize the spots over here were also handicap spots. But that wasn’t enough for her. She starts screaming at me telling me I’m disgusting and I should be ashamed of myself. After a little bit of back and forth of her screaming at me and me trying to tell her it was an accident, I start getting mad because who tf does this lady think she is. I made an honest mistake. I realized I messed up and apologized and explained to her what happen, and she continued to belittle the fck out of me. So now I’m telling this chick she’s fcking crazy and to get over herself, and I get in my car and drive away AS SHES STILL SCREAMING AT ME. She also was repeating my plate numbers, so idk what she’s planning on doing with that information or if she was just trying to act scary. 

I’d also like to add I’m very obviously very pregnant, and this WOMAN is screaming telling me what a disgusting POS I am for an accident that I was actively apologizing for. I am not the kind of person who would ever purposefully take a handicap parking spot. I stand there and wait for a stall to be open if the only one not taken is the handicap one in bathrooms. But regardless, yes even though I know I messed up and IATAH for parking in a handicap spot even if it was an accident, did I deserve to be told I’m disgusting and should be ashamed of myself over an honest mistake? Idk if it’s because I’m 7 months pregnant and already an emotional baby, but this interaction is really messing with me and I can’t get over it. ",1,1763096376.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

**A man wakes at 2:15 a.m. expecting nothing more than a quick trip to the bathroom, only to discover, minutes later, that more than two hours have vanished without a trace. What unfolded next, from warm drinks to motion lights flaring in the heavy fog, left him questioning whether something had entered his home… or whether** ***he*** **had left it.**



""This is not a UFO sighting, but it's so strange that this is the only place I could think to share it. Early one morning, something happened that left me feeling uneasy.



That night, I fell asleep on the couch. My wife asked if I wanted to get up and go to bed, but I preferred to stay on the sofa with just a blanket. Sometimes, if I get up from where I'm sleeping, I can't go back to sleep, so I decided to stay put.



I woke up on the couch in a dark room and realized I needed to use the bathroom. My daughter's bathroom is no more than six feet from the sofa, down the hallway. I got up and, on my way there, glanced at the oven clock to check the time. It was 2:15.



Usually, when I get up at this time, it's because my 6-year-old daughter has had a bad dream and jumps into our bed, which prompts me to get up and go to another room. After using the bathroom, which only takes a couple of minutes, I walked to the kitchen and grabbed a Mountain Dew from the fridge. However, I noticed my neck was killing me; I had what I'd describe as a crick, and it hurt quite a bit. So, I returned to the couch, set the soda on the floor in front of me, and rubbed my neck for a moment.



I reached down to grab the Mountain Dew, took a sip, and was surprised to find it warm. I thought something might be wrong with the fridge. It was strange because I remembered it being cold when I took it out. Just then, I felt the urge to use the bathroom again, and I was confused since I had just used it a moment ago. Then, I realized my neck felt much better; it still hurt, but not nearly as much as before.



I keep my laptop on the coffee table, so I reached over to wake it up from sleep mode. This is when I freaked out, the clock read 4:23 a.m. 



I looked over at the oven clock, and it said 4:24 a.m.



All of this happened in less than six minutes. I started to feel very uneasy and a little scared. I glanced out the door next to the couch and looked across the backyard. I noticed that the motion lights down by the barn, approximately 400 yards away, were on.



We rarely see those lights come on; they are triggered by movement. My anxiety increased when I noticed that the door was unlocked and not fully closed.



I can't describe how I felt at that moment, but I ran to my daughter's bedroom and found she was not there. I dashed to our bedroom and turned on the light. Both my wife and daughter were asleep in bed.



I returned to the family room, walked over, and locked the door. I looked towards the barn, and the light was still on. I couldn't see anything; it was just heavy fog. I felt a strange sense of unease. I wasn’t sure if I thought something was at the barn or if I was freaked out by what had just happened. I sat back down on the couch and spent the next five hours wondering how that could have possibly happened.



I still don't know how. Maybe it was a case of hypnagogia, but I don't think so; I never closed my eyes. Whatever happened during those two hours remains a mystery. One moment it was around two o'clock, and the next it was four o'clock, just like that. I have no history of sleepwalking or any other sleep disorder. I was very much awake. I’m trying to figure out how to record from my webcam to my laptop, as I plan to sleep on the couch again tonight to see if anything happens or if I might sleepwalk.



If it happens, it would be the first time. Usually, my body is in so much pain when I get up that I can't fall back asleep. I have severe back problems. I have to classify this as something unusual; “abduction” is the only label I can think of, but I want to make it clear that I'm not claiming to have been abducted.



One point I forgot to mention is that I had both of my Schipperkes sleeping on the back of the couch with me. If someone had come in, the dogs would have certainly alerted me. My wife said that when she went to bed, all the doors were locked tight."" J



**NOTE: This report resembles a textbook example of a missing-time incident, complicated by domestic environmental anomalies that should not coexist. The witness experiences a sudden temporal jump from 2:15 a.m. to 4:23 a.m. despite recalling continuous awareness, no sleep, no blackout, no grogginess, and no known sleep disorders. The details that support** ***external*** **interference rather than internal sleep disruption are striking: a cold drink becoming warm, a painful neck crick that partially resolves without explanation, motion-activated barn lights shining in heavy fog, and a previously locked door now ajar and unlocked. These are classic hallmarks found in abduction and close-contact literature, particularly the combination of unexplained time displacement, bodily discomfort, and environmental disturbances upon return.**



**The presence of two typically alert dogs that remained quiet complicates the picture, suggesting either that nothing physical entered the home or that the witness** ***himself*** **was moved without triggering canine response. The fog combined with the triggered motion sensors adds a physical-world anomaly often reported by witnesses who feel 'returned' immediately before or after perceived contact events. Yet the witness remains careful not to claim abduction, which lends credibility to their account. He is grounded, cautious, and disturbed, not eager to sensationalize. The entire sequence presents strong indicators of a controlled time-alteration event, forced dissociation, or a brief out-of-phase displacement that mimics known abduction signatures but could also fit advanced ultraterrestrial incursions or rare hypnopompic distortions.**



**The locked-door change and external motion light activation, paired with the internal time jump, are the two strongest non-psychological data points. Whatever took place, it was not a simple lapse in awareness; the environment changed** ***around*** **him. Lon**

Or could it be a milk allergy or something?,"I've always loved dairy and consumed plenty of it my whole life. About 15 years ago, I realized I had become lactose intolerant. I started taking the pills and drinking the Lactaid milk. At first, that worked, but over time, it helped less and less. Today, I take at least 1 pill (9,000) for every ""dose"" of dairy that I'm consuming. For example, 1 pill per slice of cheese, or if I have a tiny bit of cream in my coffee. 3 if I'm having a couple of slices of pizza. 4+ if I'm having Taco Bell. Etc. Tonight I had 3 large slices of pizza, and I took 4 pills. As soon as I finished, I was running to the bathroom. And that's usually how it is lol. But if I don't take any pills, the symptoms are much worse.

1ownetz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ownetz,Just passed the PMP! Thank you!,"Got laid off and have been unemployed for a year now as I am taking career break, so I figured I might as well use my time to upskill before looking for a new job. I decided to go for the PMP since it compliments my background as a Project Leader. I started studying in early September using AR’s Udemy course. It took me about 2 months to finish because I kept taking breaks, sometimes a whole week between study sessions. The course itself is great, but I’ll admit, I was just being lazy, disinterested and dragging myself through it (definitely a *me* problem, not AR’s fault). I also had trouble focusing, so I ended up watching parts of it at 1.75x–2x speed just to get through faster.

  
**RESOURCES**

* AR's 35 Units Udemy Course 
* [AR’s updated mindset video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u0rO-YQr9c) (I skipped the ones from the course since this is the updated version)
* [DM’s fast track video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUOJ_yEeyuc)
* third3rock's Cheat Sheet > Notes
* Standard Study Hall (2 Full mocks 2x each, all mini quizzes and 70% of practice questions)



**STUDY APPROACH**

I started with the mindset and fast track videos, then did about half the mini quizzes. After that, I tried my first full mock and got 73%. Finished the rest of the mini quizzes, took the second full mock with 65% score. I took the full mocks in the morning (my target exam time) to practice time management and mental stamina. Every time I missed something, I reviewed it and used ChatGPT to explain concepts more clearly because some SH explanations were kinda ""lazy"" or confusing.

After finishing the full mocks, I started checking available exam slots. Unfortunately, there weren’t many options that gave me enough time to study more while not being too far as I am having this anxiety problem. I ended up booking the exam for literally the day after my first psychological consultation. Thought it would mess with my head, but honestly, it had the opposite effect. I left that appointment feeling like a giant weight had been lifted. I actually slept well (after days of crap sleep), and on exam day, I was surprisingly calm and confident which was the total opposite of how I felt while studying and taking SH mocks. I retook both full mocks once more before the exam, which only gave me a +2% improvement.

  
**EXAM EXPERIENCE**

As for the actual PMP exam, I found it slightly *easier* than the SH mocks. The questions were shorter and about 70% of them were agile/hybrid. I had 1 graph question, maybe 6 multi-selects, 2 computations, and 1 drag-and-drop. I flagged quite a few (6, 12, 8 per section) whenever I got stuck between two “best” answers. I took the breaks, did some light jogging and jumping jacks around the testing center, and ate a couple of bananas to keep my energy up. I kept finishing each 60-question section with a ton of time left, which actually freaked me out a bit. I was like, “Am I missing something? Why is this going so smoothly?” But in the end, I finished the whole thing with 90 minutes to spare and got AT/T/AT. Treated myself to a quiet little coffee celebration in the corner afterwards.

It doesn't help that I'm blind and can't see the product photos. So, I'm hoping for some recommendations...

\* reliable brand that's been around

\* TKL or full-size with spacing around function keys, arrow cluster, and 6-pack (that's the part I can't tell)

\* no software, no keys I won't be able to use without software. This is for office use

\* lots of key travel

\* I really like blues; on the other hand, I have an IKBC with gray switches that just feel like a membrane keyboard that's sticking. ""Creamy"" is not a sound, but I'm open to whatever's going on in the market these days.

\* multi-device bluetooth (mac, pc, iphone)

\* USB-C as well



So.... a K8, I guess. But it looks to me like KeyChron is selling out all their stock. The K8's design also begged to have a death by liquid, which I knew on day 1 would be how it ended.

I've used Windows most of my life, and using Linux Mint is the best thing I've ever done, but I have a slightly annoying problem with my PC that I haven't been able to solve. While using the PC, I may be browsing, typing, using the keyboard, or using the mouse, and the screen turns off. It's as if it turns off after a period of inactivity, but I'm actually actively using my PC, and the only way to turn the screen back on is to move the mouse or click. After I turn on the screen by moving the mouse or clicking, it does not happen again for several minutes or hours; there is no specific pattern of minutes or hours for it to happen again. It should be noted that I have the power management and screen saver options disabled, which are:

Power management

Turn off the display after a period of inactivity of: Never

Suspend after a period of inactivity of: Never

When on battery power, dim the display when inactive: Off

Screen saver

Delay before screen saver starts: Never

Even with these options turned off, the problem still persists. I have all the updates installed, and I have searched for information on the Linux Mint forum, Google, and Reddit, but I haven't found anyone else with this same problem, which led me to make this post.

My previous job was my first ever big-girl job, and it was amazing. I had great mentors and it was a very positive environment. I only ever got positive feedback, and I got along super well with my team. In my new role, I immediately felt like the odd one out. My whole team often goes for coffee runs or lunches and don't invite me. I also get so much negative feedback that some days I have to go sit outside and cry it out because it feels like I can't do anything right. There are no compliment sandwiches, and I'm a sensitive person. 

A big part of my motivation to get work done in my previous role was that I cared a lot of about my team - now I feel like my team hates me, and I'm struggling to find motivation. I can see my performance going downhill, but I'm in such a dark place that it's hard to fix it (though I'm doing my best). The worst part is that objectively the work SHOULD be easy work - I feel like I'm just totally out of steam. Some days I've been coming in 10-15 minutes late because I'm dreading going to work, and I know my manager has noticed.

I recently had a tense conversation with my manager about my performance, and I'm convinced that I'm going to be let go before the end of my probation. Has anyone else ever been in a similar situation? And if I'm fired, how can I come back from it emotionally? I had so much faith in my abilities before this, and now I'm questioning everything. Is this job just a bad fit, or is it me?",2,1763094310.0,careeradvice,1,1.0,False

I felt great for the first two weeks and I was super excited. Then all the problems started to come on. It started with major brain fog, dizziness, major anxiety, and a weird taste in my mouth. I started to think of anything that I started doing new and sure enough it was the AG1. I’ve stopped for the past 3 days and I feel like I am having withdrawal symptoms. Again with the brain fog, stomach problems, and feeling of dizziness. I couldn’t have a coffee anymore without major anxiety coming in. I’ve stopped and I am waiting to feel better.

I’m sick and fucking tired of being the rock, the safe place, the caregiver, provider. You always act as if I DONT HAVE TRAUMA TOO. LIKE MY SHIT IN MY HEAD DOESNT MATTER. You just continue on, forever downwards on the slope, while I always reassure you, I always take care of the rest. 

I’ve realized that I’ve been shoved into this weird fucking cycle of life with you and accepted that this was all NORMAL. ITS NOT FUCKING NORMAL. IT HASN’T BEEN NORMAL, EVER. 

The amount of control you’ve managed to gain, while I’ve been asleep at the wheel, accepting your rules, while ignoring your FUCKING SHITTY FUCKING BEHAVIOR absolutely sickens me. I’m so fucking tired. 

You fucking blindsided me, and I’ve told myself multiple times over the past few years with each small recollection of the many fucking things you’ve put me through, all of the weird ass rules that I’ve just accepted because I FUCKING LOVE YOU, I’ve told myself, “I’m waking up”. I’m not just waking up anymore. I’m awake, and having my fucking coffee. You sit there, day after fucking day, and blame it on whatever else is going on but you never once ever give one thought outside of yourself to YOUR OWN SHITTY FUCKING ACTIONS AND BEHAVIORS. You NEVER take responsibility for any of it. 

You never act like you give a real shit about me at all. I’m just your comfort, your provider, your “I’ll fix it” person, your punching bag, your stress ball, your shoulder to cry on, someone who never complained about your bullshit. Someone who you conditioned to keep my mouth fucking shut. No one achieved that until you came along. I never allowed that kind of power over me, but because I FUCKING LOVE YOU, I let you drive me into silence. I allowed you to steamroll my own feelings, shut my mouth time after time after time. 

YOU ARE LOSING ME AND YOU WONT GIVE A FUCK UNTIL IM GONE. And yet, I’ve been emotionally abandoned by you for years, it’s ME who feels like a piece of shit for contemplating leaving. Jesus FUCKING Christ, I cannot believe the absolute mind fuckery you’ve afflicted me with. 

FUCK. FUUUUUUUUUUCK. IM FUCKING AWAKE, AND YOU ARE LOSING ME BECAUSE YOU REFUSE TO FUCKING LISTEN TO ME, THAT I ACTUALLY MATTER AND I EXIST BESIDES WHENEVER YOU DECIDE TO SHOW ME SOME ATTENTION. FUCK. ",17,1763094118.0,screamintothevoid,0,1.0,False
