1gzaa2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMagnusArchives/comments/1gzaa2i/insomnia_the_buried_and_the_spiral/,"Insomnia, the buried, and the spiral","Maybe this belongs on r/statementbegins but I more am looking for anyone else who feels similarly?

It‚Äôs 5am where I live and I haven‚Äôt gone to sleep yet. For no reason in particular, I accidentally pulled my first all nighter. I‚Äôm usually asleep before midnight, and I have class in 5 hours. 

It‚Äôs weird staying up this late without having intended to do so. The early hours of the morning seem to do something to the mind- more that once I could have sworn the lamp in the corner of my room was looking at me. And the sound of the tag on my robe crinkling sounded like a door rattling in another room. 

I live alone, and I know there is nobody here but my sleep schedule has been absolutely fucked this weekend. On Friday, I went to a club and was out until 4:30 am, and then I slept until noon. On Saturday, I took sleep meds and slept for a full 12 hours. 

I‚Äôve realized that sleep deprivation and the feeling of all of this missed time just piling up feels like the buried. I know the longer I stay awake, the worse it will be. But I just keep digging myself deeper into a hole of exhaustion. 

I wonder if this gives some credibility to that one statement about insomnia? I can‚Äôt remember which one but it‚Äôs where the statement giver sees the billboard for coffee and who would stay up for days at a time testing the limits of the body. I don‚Äôt remember which fear it‚Äôs originally coded as, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the spiral and/or buried are included. ",1,1732507673.0,TheMagnusArchives,0,1.0,False
1gza9qi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xcaret/comments/1gza9qi/overpriced_chaos_a_honeymoon_disaster_at_hotel/,Overpriced Chaos: A Honeymoon Disaster at Hotel Xcaret Mexico,"In mid-November 2024, my wife and I returned to Hotel Xcaret Mexico for our honeymoon, hoping to recreate the magic of our incredible experience at Hotel Xcaret Arte in 2023. Unfortunately, our stay this time was filled with frustrations, disorganization, and disappointment.

  
**Day 1:**

We arrived around 10:00 AM, knowing our room wouldn‚Äôt be ready yet. At check-in in Casa Fuego, the resort‚Äôs ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù adult-only section, we received our bracelets and were told to explore the property while we waited. However, no one offered to take our luggage, leaving us to carry our bags as we navigated the resort.

We decided to have breakfast at Mercado de la Merced, but it was a chaotic experience. The wait time for a table was nearly 30 minutes, and while the food was fine, the bathrooms were a complete disaster. Most of the restrooms were filthy, and the only clean one I found had a broken lock, which was uncomfortable and frustrating.

As it began pouring rain, we ran to the Fuego restaurant, one of the few open spaces offering shelter, where we spent time over coffee and tea. At 1:00 PM, we returned to the Casa Fuego lobby to ask if they could take our bags so we could explore without worrying about them. While the staff finally took our luggage, they didn‚Äôt provide a claim ticket, which would later prove to be a problem.

At 3:00 PM, we came back to the lobby for check-in. Even though we were first in line, we were inexplicably the last to be assisted, finally receiving our room key at 3:20 PM. When we arrived at our room, our luggage wasn‚Äôt there. My wife spent nearly an hour tracking it down, as no one seemed to know where it was.

To make matters worse, our room didn‚Äôt live up to expectations. The furniture was worn and outdated, the bathroom ceiling looked like it might collapse, one of the bedside outlets didn‚Äôt work, and the lights flickered. There was no acknowledgment of our honeymoon‚Äîno card, no decoration, nothing to make the occasion feel special.

The day ended with dinner at Teatro del Rio, where we enjoyed the show and appreciated the small dessert with ‚ÄúFeliz Luna de Miel‚Äù written on it. Unfortunately, this was the only gesture recognizing our honeymoon during the entire stay.



**Day 2:**

We woke up to loud music coming from the neighboring room, realizing how paper-thin the walls were. Later at the rooftop pool, another guest blasted music on a wireless speaker, disrupting the atmosphere. Staff didn‚Äôt intervene in either situation, showing a lack of enforcement of basic rules.

We also noticed children wandering around Casa Fuego, despite it being marketed as an adult-only section. The doors separating Casa Fuego from the rest of the resort weren‚Äôt working, and staff didn‚Äôt seem to care about maintaining the area‚Äôs exclusivity.

Adding to our frustration, people were smoking throughout the property, disregarding the designated smoking areas, and again, staff failed to address this. After breakfast, we went to Xcaret Park, which we generally enjoy, but this time it felt more focused on upselling activities. Many of these involved animal interactions, which raised ethical concerns. The staff‚Äôs claims about releasing dolphins into the wild felt insincere and left us uneasy.



**Day 3:**

Our morning was disrupted by a screaming child running through Casa Fuego‚Äîyet another sign that the adult-only claim wasn‚Äôt enforced. Later, construction noise outside our room ruined any attempt at relaxation.

At night, we attended the Xcaret M√©xico Espectacular show, where we witnessed more upsetting animal mistreatment. Two dogs were part of the performance, and they looked terrified the entire time. It was heartbreaking and completely took away from any enjoyment of the show. For a resort that markets itself as eco-conscious, this display of animal exploitation was disappointing and hypocritical.



**Day 4:**

After brunch we eager to leave. What should have been a romantic honeymoon turned into a stressful and underwhelming experience.

\--

While there were some positives, like the live music, poolside food, and the boat shuttle to the park, these small bright spots were overshadowed by poor management and lack of organization. The resort was hosting multiple weddings during our stay, and it was clear the staff was overwhelmed and unprepared to handle the number of guests.

Overall, Hotel Xcaret Mexico failed to deliver on its promises of exclusivity and relaxation. For the price we paid, we expected much more. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this resort, especially for anyone celebrating a special occasion. Save yourself the hassle and choose a place that genuinely values its guests.",2,1732507642.0,Xcaret,0,1.0,False

However, looking at Black Friday sales, I am considering getting a Galaxy Tab S9 or something like that, as a secondary device, so that I can move away from my desk and work somewhere else (coffee shop, kitchen, visiting parents, whatever). I've never used Termux nor any of the coding solutions available on Android systems. Would they be decent enough that I would enjoy having the option to move my work from my desktop to that tablet? I am open to alternative recomendations, but I know I like my Samsung phone and, while I'm open to any other android suggestions, I am relatively familiar with the use you can get out of the DeX environment.

I know the obvious answer is to get an old laptop, but I honestly just don't want that. I had a surface and I used it a lot, but I want something even lighter- and I want something I could ACTUALLY pick up without the keyboard and use for other practical purpuses during my day.

Tl;dr: has anybody used a tablet for the CS courses? Would it work well to use as a secondary device? Does Termux do the job well? Other Android apps or resources that would get the job done?",1,1732507553.0,SNHU,1,1.0,False

When was the last time you could call yourself the nerdiest kid on your block (and it be true)?

The answer, of course is this week! Sign up now for EPL's annual adult-only capstone spelldown in which many will fall & only one will rise while out spelling them all. Verbally exemplify your linguistic prowess as you vowel & consonant your way towards the ultimate bragging right & simultaneously become the epitome nerd, your stark white socks pulled triumphantly high as you march before us mere mortals who chose to silently watch from afar rather than risk our egos (ehrm... professional dignity) in the onslaught that was. If you're so inclined, tuck that pencil behind a lobe & don your sturdy horn-rimmed glasses before signing up for this time-honoured tradition! It's FREE, for both competitors & their audience.

**5 cool events this week**:

* The Bee
* Lights Up! (Fort Sask) 
* Free Admission @ AGA
* Lite Up The Nite (Morinville) 
* The Salvation Army's Festival of Carols

# The Bee

When was the last time you could call yourself the nerdiest kid on your block (and it be true)? When did your peers last dote you & pay homage to your brainy brawn, thanks in due part to an interstellar performance of wit & wary where you fought hard and came through scathed yet victorious? The answer, of course is this week! Sign up now for EPL's annual adult-only capstone spelldown in which many will fall & only one will rise while out spelling them all. Verbally exemplify your linguistic prowess as you vowel & consonant your way towards the ultimate bragging right & simultaneously become the epitome nerd, your stark white socks pulled triumphantly high as you march before us mere mortals who chose to silently watch from afar rather than risk our egos (ehrm... professional dignity) in the onslaught that was. If you're so inclined, tuck that pencil behind a lobe & don your sturdy horn-rimmed glasses before signing up for this time-honoured tradition! It's FREE, for both competitors & their audience. 

# Lights Up! 

If that daunting task doesn't suit you well, unwind instead this week in Fort Saskatchewan at the annual Light's Up mini-festival. This FREE event features several light shows, a caricature artist, live music, carolers, face painting, a petting zoo, fire pits & so much more. Of course, this event wouldn't be what it is without the light-up, so get on down & grab yourself a cookie/hot chocolate, partake in the festivities, hang with your neighbours & enjoy the spectacular arrangements. 

# Free Admission @ AGA 

Whether you're looking for a fantastic date night idea or a hearty injection of culture on a budget, I've got you covered. This Thursday evening only from 4-7pm, head down to the Art Gallery of Alberta to see what's on display. Though there is no specific event on this particular evening, admission is FREE meaning you get to make your own event! Check out some cubism before hitting up Made By Marcus? Check.

They met at a party and hit it off immediately, feeling amazing chemistry. They have gotten pretty serious very quickly. Introducing into one another's social circles, meeting the family, and generally being together all the time. 

We met up for coffee today, and while he was catching me up on his life and this new relationship, he said some things that have me seriously concerned. 

As the saying goes, when you have on rose coloured glasses all the red flags just look like flags. 

When they started dating, she let Jeff know that she already had a boyfriend who she lived with, but was planning on breaking up with; it has been 4.5 months, she is still living with this guy and hasn't broken up with him. Jeff sites her having trouble doing this because she suffers with BPD, and has been in this previous relationship for 3 years. Rhi's boyfriend does not know about Jeff, she is cheating on him. 

Rhi has introduced Jeff to her parents, but only as a friend who she is ""hanging out with"". Jeff has bought he multiple extravagant gifts, from the sounds of it he pays for a lot of things for her.

He is bothered by being ""the other woman"" and doe not feel good about the current situation. I encouraged him to put his foot down.

""She needs to either shit or get off the pot, and decide if she's breaking up with him. Right now she's having her cake and eating it too, you and her boyfriend are both being taken advantage of"" 

When I said this, he got really quiet and shut down. The rest of our visit was quite short, and at the end he made a comment ""guess you won't be wanting to meet Rhi anytime soon""

While my language was a bit informal, I think it was something he needed to hear. 

I think this relationship is doomed, but I won't tell him that. He's an adult and can make his own decisions, I'll be there to support him. I don't know how he can trust someone when their relationship started with such deception. ",3,1732507005.0,AITAH,4,0.8,False

I'm an atheist and wear apparel that makes it obvious. 

To the young Christian lady that approached me at the coffee shop today. 

Thanks for asking about my apparel and thoughts on belief. I know neither of us convinced each other to convert (or de-convert) but I applaud you for asking.

Asking questions and doing research is what led me to being out as an atheist.

right now im offering a 475 (possibly lower) rent, 225 less than what they are currently offering (699)

the rooms are furnished with a full size bed, dresser and desk, as well as a sofa, coffee table and tv in the living room. they also have their own pool, gym, and other recreational areas.

might be a bit far from campus, but it is a 20 min bus drive with their own bus system (7am-7pm), so it shouldn't be that much of an issue. plus, meijer is really close to it (abt 20 min walk), so groceries shouldn't be an issue

1gza1tz,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/1gza1tz/friend_constantly_hops_from_mlm_to_mlm/,Friend constantly hops from MLM to MLM,"So I have a friend, well call her ""R"", 28F, with a child who is on the spectrum (relevant because this adds a lot of stress to her life and negatively affects her mental health, things she regularly posts about on FB). She has a boyfriend, she doesn't work and as far as I know her boyfriend doesn't either. So money will be tight.

As the title says, she hops from MLM to MLM. The latest one is Farmasi.
As soon as she announced it, I groaned. For years I've seen her posting about this MLM, that product that works miracles, this deal, that offer, etc. She always stops doing it at some point, not sure why (probably not a good enough pay out), but then months later she's doing another one and raving about THEIR products just like she was the last one.
It drives me nuts. She's just made a post saying the Farmasi package will be delivered soon, and I'm bracing for impact of the posts.

I kinda wanna say something to her. I did comment on her ""it arrives soon!"" post saving ""Another one? üò≥"", but may delete it as it was a knee-jerk reaction that was perhaps inappropriate. I'm just tired of the ""My child is so difficult, this is what they did today that made my life hell and worsened my mental health"" (birth control and meds reminder posts, I call them), and ""This product will build you a car whilst making you the best coffee you've ever tasted with exactly 37,492 grains of sugar in it!"" (The typical ""this is a miracle product!"" type  MLM posts/""Reviews"")

But I also don't want to unfriend her. We've known each other since 16 or so, been there for each other during tough times - some of which we've both experienced but separately, have similar interests that we do occasionally speak about, and I know me unfriending her would hurt her feelings, as I've had someone close unfriend and block me out of the blue before too (I now know it was because she started dating my ex). Regardless of what she posts, I'd never want to hurt her feelings.
I also know that me saying something about her doing yet another MLM might also offend her.

I know you can somehow limit the posts you see from a person, but then I also will miss out on posts that I may genuinely want to see such as those that pertain to our mutual hobbies.",3,1732506895.0,antiMLM,1,1.0,False

In the world of digital payments, where swipes and taps dominate, one quiet champion has been reshaping generosity in a way that‚Äôs as innovative as it is exciting. Ladies, gentlemen, and crypto enthusiasts, let me introduce you to the **Bitcoin donate button**‚Äîthe ultimate tool to fuel altruism in the blockchain era.

If you‚Äôve been searching for a way to supercharge your fundraising game or add a sprinkle of futuristic flair to your donation efforts, the **Bitcoin donate button generator** has got your back. So, grab your coffee (or crypto-themed energy drink) and let‚Äôs dive into why this digital marvel is shaking up the donation landscape.

# What Is the Bitcoin Donate Button, and Why Should You Care?

Let‚Äôs start with the basics. The **Bitcoin donate button** is a sleek, customizable widget that you can embed on your website to accept Bitcoin donations effortlessly. Imagine a ‚Äúdonate‚Äù button but cooler, techier, and oh-so-modern.

With the help of the **Bitcoin donate button generator**, even tech novices can set up a donation mechanism faster than it takes Bitcoin to complete a single block confirmation. (That‚Äôs pretty fast, in case you‚Äôre wondering.) It‚Äôs intuitive, versatile, and the perfect way to show the world you‚Äôre not just keeping up with the times‚Äîyou‚Äôre ahead of them.

# Why Traditional Donations Are So 2020

Let‚Äôs face it: traditional donation methods are clunky. Bank transfers involve paperwork (ew), credit card payments come with hefty fees (yikes), and cash? Well, let‚Äôs hope you have a wheelbarrow for those pennies.

Enter the Bitcoin donate button‚Äîa no-fuss solution to modern giving.

1. **No Intermediaries**: Traditional platforms skim a percentage off your donations. With Bitcoin, it‚Äôs peer-to-peer. That means more of your supporter‚Äôs contributions go directly to your cause.
2. **Borderless Giving**: Whether your donor is in Tokyo or Timbuktu, Bitcoin donations flow seamlessly across borders. No currency conversions, no bank delays.
3. **Privacy Perks**: For those who value discretion, Bitcoin offers a way to give without sharing sensitive banking details.

Simply put, the **Bitcoin donate button generator** makes setting up modern donations feel like a breeze‚Äîand leaves outdated methods eating dust.

# How to Use the Bitcoin Donate Button Generator Like a Pro

So, how does this magical tool work? I‚Äôm glad you asked! Head over to [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/donate-button/](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/donate-button/) and let the magic unfold.

Here‚Äôs the lowdown:

1. **Generate Your Button**: Use the **Bitcoin donate button generator** to create a button that matches your style. Customize the text, colors, and even add some pizzazz with animation.
2. **Integrate It**: Copy the provided code and paste it into your website. Voila! Your Bitcoin donate button is live and ready for action.
3. **Share the Love**: Promote your new button on social media, email campaigns, and anywhere your supporters hang out.

It‚Äôs that simple. You don‚Äôt need a degree in computer science‚Äîjust a cause and a sprinkle of enthusiasm.

# Who Can Benefit from a Bitcoin Donate Button?

Let‚Äôs play a quick game: Do you fall into one of these categories?

* **Nonprofits** looking to expand their donation base globally.
* **Content Creators** tired of relying on ad revenue.
* **Open-Source Developers** seeking community support.
* **Environmentalists**, **Artists**, or even **Alien Enthusiasts** with a cause to fund.

If you nodded along to any of these, congratulations‚Äîyou‚Äôre the perfect candidate for the **Bitcoin donate button generator**.

# Why Bitcoin Donations Are the Future

Let‚Äôs pause for a moment and talk about why Bitcoin is so well-suited for donations.

1. **Decentralization**: Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt bow to banks, governments, or middlemen. It‚Äôs the people‚Äôs currency, making it ideal for grassroots causes and independent creators.
2. **Transparency**: Every Bitcoin transaction is recorded on the blockchain. This creates a transparent ledger that donors can verify, building trust like never before.
3. **Global Adoption**: Bitcoin isn‚Äôt just for tech bros anymore. Grandma‚Äôs knitting club is mining crypto (probably), and your donors are likely familiar with Bitcoin too.

Adding a **Bitcoin donate button** is like putting up a ‚ÄúWe Accept Bitcoin‚Äù sign in the digital realm‚Äîit‚Äôs an invitation for forward-thinkers to support your mission.

# The Fun Side of Bitcoin Donations

Who says donating can‚Äôt be fun? The **Bitcoin donate button generator** doesn‚Äôt just create functionality; it creates excitement. Picture this:

* Your donors receive notifications of their contributions in Bitcoin. üéâ
* You get to watch the donations roll in like it‚Äôs Christmas morning‚Äîbut with satoshis.
* Your website suddenly looks 100% cooler with a futuristic Bitcoin donate button.

It‚Äôs not just about raising funds; it‚Äôs about creating a memorable experience for your supporters.

# Frequently Asked Questions About Bitcoin Donate Buttons

**Q: Is Bitcoin volatile?**  
A: Sure, Bitcoin‚Äôs value can make a roller coaster look tame. But donations are about supporting a cause, not playing the stock market. Many platforms allow you to convert Bitcoin into fiat currency instantly.

**Q: Do I need to be a crypto expert?**  
A: Absolutely not. The **Bitcoin donate button generator** makes it foolproof. If you can copy-paste, you can do this.

When we argue(which we really try not to do), he doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me and if he is talking to me, he‚Äôs cold and mean. He doesn‚Äôt sympathize that he‚Äôs just made me sad, he‚Äôs more annoyed if anything that I‚Äôm so ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù when all I want to do is make sure we don‚Äôt go to sleep upset at each other. So I push him to talk to me but it just makes things worse because he‚Äôs so angry/bothered already. And he says prophet Muhammad (pbuh) says to not speak when you‚Äôre angry and this is why (hence why he doesn‚Äôt like to talk to me when he‚Äôs mad). I understand this but at some point I‚Äôm just conflicted, why would he rather not talk about it and would prefer to go to bed upset? I just don‚Äôt get it. His patience is running thin for me because I bother him when he wants to just play video games because I want to call him and talk on the phone but weekends are his ‚Äúdays‚Äù to game. Today, we were supposed to start a show together because I‚Äôve been asking since last weekend to do something with him since we don‚Äôt do anything but talk or text when we are able to communicate. I asked him if we could watch the show earlier in the day and he told me no, we can watch later tonight. We in fact did not watch, we ended up arguing because when I got home around 4 pm after running errands and he was still video gaming, I had told him ‚ÄúI‚Äôm home now, just waiting on you‚Äù and he said ‚Äúokay you pick the show and we‚Äôll watch later‚Äù, two hours pass and he‚Äôs still gaming so I start calling him to tell him ‚Äúenough please, can we start watching‚Äù and he gets frustrated and doesn‚Äôt respond for another 30 minutes when I finally call him, he‚Äôs in bed saying he doesn‚Äôt wanna watch and he just wants to talk because it‚Äôs already so late. When earlier I told him that was exactly what was gonna happen. He finally agreed to watch the show but my laptop was glitching and I told him I‚Äôd call him in a quick second to reset the call to fix my laptop and I think he took that opportunity to get off the call because apparently his mom had called him in that moment and he had left his phone in his room. At that point I wasn‚Äôt aware his mom was calling him, I truly thought he was ignoring me because he didn‚Äôt want to watch so I was spam calling him. He finally picked up and was so upset I was spam calling him and now we‚Äôre not talking. I told him you won, you didn‚Äôt have to watch the show and now he‚Äôs sound asleep. I‚Äôm so upset because I truly just want to spend some quality time with him since we can‚Äôt in person as we‚Äôre long distance. He‚Äôs three hours ahead of me. Sometimes I feel like we‚Äôre not meant to be, as much as I love him and he claims to love me and we‚Äôre trying to make this as halal as possible with our families involved. I was already so embarrassed when we were finally going to watch the show, I didn‚Äôt even want to watch at that point because I basically had to beg, but I was so excited to spend time with him that I sucked up my pride. And before we were going to start watching the show he said in a joking way, ‚Äúif you want to catch my attention, why don‚Äôt you start getting into stuff I like?‚Äù And I said ‚Äúsuch as? Video games?? Soccer?? Why don‚Äôt you try stuff I like?‚Äù And he said ‚Äúwhat? Coffee and yapping?‚Äù

It has been 2 years since I‚Äôve gone on a date. I graduated from a school where most people were male (about 65%) and dating was atrociously difficult for many reasons. Regardless, I got a few good conversations that led to women saying they want to meet for coffee, etc. As soon as we get to the date, no show, ‚ÄúI was at work‚Äù, or completely ghosted. This has ruined my feelings towards anyone offering me friendship or kindness, and it really, really sucks. This happened 3 times at the end of college. Enter graduating and after going on dating apps, I‚Äôve found there is no difference, if not worse

One time a girl said she wanted to come play volleyball with me and her friends. No-show. She texted me after saying she wants to get lunch. No show ‚ÄúI‚Äôm out of town right now‚Äù, and that night I locked eyes with her at the bar. Her friend standing right next to me. F*ck that hurt. 

Tonight I got stood up at a local bar after moving across the country. Does anyone value conviction anymore?

I, M23 am not an ugly dude. Yeah, I don‚Äôt have the veneer-white perfect smile or the look of that one guy from fight club, but I sit a little over 5‚Äô10, 170lbs, and a mere 12% body fat (thanks gym scale). I‚Äôve got a full-time job that I love, an apartment roof over my head, and things have been going my way. I‚Äôm blessed but emotionally I have given up on dating, and feel like I will never be loved by anyone except my mother and brother. 

Idk what to do. I feel like posting a photo on here and having people rate me 1-10 on looks alone. Other things about me like hobbies, passions‚Ä¶ people just don‚Äôt care anymore. Sorry for the rant but I‚Äôve felt pretty down. 8x might be a record‚Ä¶",1,1732506426.0,self,0,1.0,False

I got bumped up to 36mg which also didn't seem to do very much besides kill my appetite, and I did find work a little less tedious, but nothing life changing. 

Finally, I got bumped up to 54mg which turned me into an emotionless zombie, but did improve my productivity and focus because nothing excited me enough to distract me. It developed into a depression that was bad enough that I would get asked if I was alright at least once a day because I wasnt reacting to anything. I knew it was the medication, because it I didn't take it on the weekends, I felt like myself again and as soon as I took it again on Monday morning, I could feel the dark cloud descend within an hour or so, and my personality would disappear again.

I stopped drinking coffee to see if that was reacting with the medication, and I do feel much better without the coffee but when I was due to renew my prescription, I told my doctor about the depression in the hopes that we could maybe try something else. 

Instead, he prescribed me 18mg ""3 times a day"" and told me to ""experiment"". I asked him what he meant and whether I should take two in the morning and one at lunch or all three in the morning and he again told me to work it out in my experiment. Am I overreacting by thinking that's... at the very least, quite lazy medical practice?? What should I do with this medication????? ",1,1732506243.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

I've always wanted to experience romantic love. I worry that the people out there who are in the dating pool aren't really interested in romance anymore, that they got to experience a romantic love earlier in life and have grown out of that. It makes sense to want something more practical in your 30s, but ideally I would like something both practical and romantic. 

I know a lot of people are looking to have kids and are factoring that into looking for a partner, and since I don't want kids that's not something I keep in mind when dating. 

Honestly most of my dates have felt like job interviews. Maybe it's because they are coffee or dinner? I am thinking I am going to start planning for walks in the park for first dates so they don't feel so stiff.

Maybe I am just insecure? I know thinking about being someone's second choice, after they got to date someone they loved and it didn't work out, makes me sad. I'm probably asking too much and need to get over myself. ",2,1732506241.0,LesbianActually,0,1.0,False

So I asked my (newish) friend if he‚Äôd ever thought about us being more than friends. He replied that he was flattered but that his life is a shit show and he‚Äôs not really in a position to offer anything to anyone else rn. I was bummed but understood. 

I guess since then I‚Äôve been struggling with how to act towards him and then how to take care of myself. I‚Äôve tried to act as normal as possible like nothing happened but I can‚Äôt help but think maybe something shifted. 

It might sound dumb but he used to always be the first one to like and comment on all my stories and I‚Äôve noticed a significant dropoff there. 

Last weekend I messaged him because I was going to be in his neighborhood so I said if he wanted to go for a walk/get a coffee or something that could be nice. 

He ended up already having plans but overall his response was positive; he showed interest in what i was doing and told me about what he‚Äôd been up to. He was at an event that he thought i‚Äôd be into and said we should check it out sometime together. 

I guess now I feel that the ball is in his court and I‚Äôve been trying to just move on mentally and focus on other things which has been going well. I actually muted his stories just to give myself some space but hope it hasn‚Äôt come across as passive aggressive or something.

Now that everything seems 100% back to normal this year, and more and more activities and events and occurring, I find myself meeting more and more people. I‚Äôve reconnected with friends I haven‚Äôt seen since HS or uni, and I‚Äôm meeting their friends as well.

Sometimes I randomly meet a guy friend of a friend and they end up asking me out, planning dates multiple weeks in a row.

I like this person as a friend, yet I‚Äôm not a 100% sure if I wanna be in a relationship with them, so I feel bad since they‚Äôre always looking for ways to ask me out and treat me to coffee or a meal. 

How do I not feel guilty about them paying for my meals? To be fair sometimes I insist on paying for my share of the activity (if we do golf for example), but the guys ALWAYS insist on paying for the movie tickets and the food. I should also add that I am Chinese by ethnicity and I live in Southeast Asia so guys paying for meals is the norm / standard. 

My friends are always telling me it‚Äôs no big deal, just enjoy the attention, and go with the flow even if you‚Äôre not 100% sure if you like the guy‚Äîthat‚Äôs just the normal part of dating, and that I should start my ‚Äúdating‚Äù era.

1gz9g70,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/1gz9g70/delusions_paranoia_false_accusations/,Delusions? Paranoia? False accusations?,"I posted a couple of months ago when my mother (86) had a stroke. Since then, she‚Äôs gone through rehab, has made huge progress and is now back home. She is largely functional & independent during the day. Until recently, she has been fully cognizant. Always aware of date, year, world news and events going on around us, fluent in both the languages we speak, etc.

Things changed a few days ago when she started exhibiting some of the traits my grandmother (her mother) did at her age. Also post stroke. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs connected to a stroke or not? I was accused of stealing ridiculous items when I was in her home taking care of her (Maxwell House coffee & laundry detergent) before I left.

I do not live nearby and left a few weeks after she got home from rehab. My sister is there to take care of her and my sister is out to solely inherit what my mother has. Which isn‚Äôt a huge amount but a house & small inheritance. For 20+ years, my mother has had a joint bank account with me, which she had set up so that I could pay her bills if the need ever arose. I got an email alert that they closed it yesterday so I am completely shut out. I used to be a co-executor of my mother‚Äôs will but I‚Äôm sure she has executed another will in the last few days too.

I‚Äôm at a loss as to what to do. There is no way my mother is doing this in a fully cognizant way. She hated when her mother did this & I‚Äôve heard her complain about it for 30 years, but now she‚Äôs become her mother. My sister is taking advantage to obtain any assets for her.

Do I just let it go? My sister doesn‚Äôt have her best interest at heart but is there taking care of her so should I just let her manipulate to get whatever assets? But I hate to have things end this way because it‚Äôs not fair, and - before the brain changes - my mother has been a WONDERFUL mother who I am blessed to have, love very much, and hate to see her last days/months/years be like this. But I can‚Äôt be there every day like my sister can so maybe I should just let it go?

I‚Äôm rambling a bit here, I realize, I‚Äôm just really at a loss. Any thoughts appreciated.

1gz9fvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesia/comments/1gz9fvg/a_thread_about_relationships/,A Thread About Relationships,"I‚Äôve been lurking here for a long time, and every now and then, I see some questions about relationship advice that make me feel sorry for the person asking. It‚Äôs clear that many are overthinking things and making dating way more complicated than it needs to be. So, I wanted to share some advice on how to approach dating with realistic expectations. Hopefully, this helps some of you avoid unnecessary confusion and heartbreak.

You meet a girl. Maybe she‚Äôs in your class, a mutual friend, a match on a dating app, or someone you‚Äôve met online. After a few small conversations and following her on social media, you tell yourself, ""I think I‚Äôm in love with her."" Stop right there. You‚Äôre not in love with her, you‚Äôre in love with the idea of her that your mind has created based on limited interactions and assumptions. The truth is, you don‚Äôt really know her yet. What you‚Äôre experiencing is just an image you‚Äôve built in your head. Instead of focusing on ways to make her interested in you or changing yourself to match her supposed ideal, your goal should be to get to know the real person she is. Don‚Äôt waste time trying to fit into her idea of the perfect partner. Focus on whether she‚Äôs actually the person you think she is, or if your assumptions are way off.

The key is to move things forward quickly. Waiting too long before meeting up will only build more expectations, and not always in a positive way. Find a shared interest, something you both enjoy, and use that as an excuse to suggest a low-pressure meetup. Keep it simple, like a casual coffee, and save the deeper conversations for when you‚Äôre actually together in person. If she‚Äôs hesitant or turns you down, don‚Äôt take it personally, try again later. If she doesn‚Äôt offer any alternative plans or turns you down multiple times, stop contacting her and move on. If she agrees to meet, great! Start with something public, like a coffee shop, where you both can leave if it‚Äôs not going well. You don‚Äôt want to lock yourselves into something like a movie date where you can‚Äôt talk. If the date goes well, suggest a second meetup, preferably with an activity or something fun to do together. Avoid making the first date too serious.

After the date, keep it casual. Let her know you had a good time and would like to see her again, but then focus on living your life. Don‚Äôt linger on texting or trying to read into things too much. If she ghosts you, doesn‚Äôt respond, or just isn‚Äôt showing interest, don‚Äôt waste your time. No answer is still an answer, and it‚Äôs your cue to stop chasing. Move on, continue improving yourself, and when the time is right, you‚Äôll be ready to meet someone else. If things don‚Äôt work out, thank her for the time you spent together, then move forward. 

If she‚Äôs genuinely interested in you, she will make it easy. There will be no guessing game. The signs will be clear, and when it‚Äôs time to talk about exclusivity, you‚Äôll know it. And you‚Äôll know the answer already. If she‚Äôs not reciprocating or things don‚Äôt feel right, don‚Äôt hold on too long hoping for something to change. The right connection is built on mutual interest, and if it‚Äôs there, it won‚Äôt be hard to see.",7,1732504885.0,indonesia,0,1.0,False

1gz9dfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/reactivedogs/comments/1gz9dfz/hoa_letter/,HOA Letter ,"So, here‚Äôs the email I sent an hour ago to the HOA in my condominium complex. I am nervous, but need all feedback, good, bad, and ugly. How do I protect my dog? How do I protect myself? 

Copied verbatim with names changed and some additional notes for Reddit. 

Tonight, there was a situation where my dogs and I were finishing our dog walk, and a small group of people were waiting outside of my condo.  The situation quickly devolved to them approaching my dogs, berating me with insults, and creating a lot of stress.

Information:
1.  I am training my shelter puppy.  He has come such a long way in such a short time.  He does pull, whine, and jump.  Neither of my dogs have harmed any living being to my knowledge or during my care.  I have zero reason to believe either animal has any aggressive tendencies.   We walk with this puppy on a Martingale collar and gentle lead to support positive behavior.  He is attached to a leash that is attached to a belt to ensure that he is never loose, even if he pulls.  
Reddit - I've owned these two shelter dogs for maybe 6-7 months.  They had zero manners, and unfortunately one of them is super reactive on a leash.  He's pretty damn good now, with the exception of some whining.  Tonight, it was back at ground zero.  I think it was my stress and the entire situation that caused the regression.  Feel free to tear me apart for how I handled it.  
2.  The woman, SnootyFace, has a pitbull that has lunged, barked loudly, and bared its teeth at me when I am alone, my two dogs that I had when I moved in that have since passed away, and my two dogs that I have now.  He is on a regular leash and collar from what I've seen, though when I see him the moment is usually stressful and as I am attempting to create distance between us for my own safety and that of my pets.
Reddit - She has a reactive dog too.  So she gets it....right?  right?  
3.  I do not know why, but SnootyFace has behaved with hostility towards me in the past.  I actually texted her about it, because I didn't know why she went from cloyingly sweet to saying rude things so quickly.  This happened within the first ~6 months to a year of me buying my property.  She denied it, denied an invitation to meet for coffee and discuss it, and hasn't spoken to me until tonight when she yelled at me.  I have noticed that people who are in her little group have behaved with hostility towards me via not saying hi back and looking at me and laughing.  I believe that this may provide context to the situation.  

Events:
1.  I am walking with my dogs and the setup detailed above when I see SnootyFace, OlderLady, and CreepyGuy, plus a few others waiting next to my condo.  
2.  I stop and we all look at one another in silence.  It is an entire group of people glaring me down in silence in the dark as my puppy starts whining, and the anxiety of figuring out how to handle the situation when feeling so physically intimidated was so incredibly anxiety-inducing.
3.  I shorten the leash and pull my dogs off to the side to let them pass, as they are not moving.  I put my dogs in a sit.
4.  OlderLady and CreepyGuy walk past with their little dogs.  My dogs are jumping and whining.
5.  Their dogs are lunging on their leashing barking as they pass us.  
6.  OlderLady begins yelling at me, calling me a jerk.  
7.  I said, ""Yeah, you are.""  My voice was not raised.  Her head snapped and she made a nasty face at me, continuing to yell at me.
Reddit - I was in the wrong here, and I know it.  I shouldn't have said anything.  But, THE AUDACITY!  Like, logical people who live happy lives DO NOT want to fight in public!  Why yell?  Why do that?  
8.  CreepyGuy began yelling, and the two kept yelling at me until they were roughly 40-50 feet away.
- Sidenote for Reddit:  CreepyGuy used to literally wait outside of my condo for me and ""bump"" into me when I first moved in.  He used to say weird, sexual things all the time (He once told me 50 Shades of Grey was the most basic ish ever) and it was a whole thing.  I finally let him know I wasn't interested and it didn't exactly go over with him well.  He's best buds with SnootyFace.  I'm CERTAIN that they've had little bitch fests about me over it.  And SnootyFace glares me down with such hatred when I see her out.  If I start speaking to someone in our complex, sure enough, SnootyFace is suddenly out walking her dogs with them and that person no longer speaks to me.  
9.  I put my dogs in a sit again, and start to peek to see whether the others went in a different direction or are also going to pass.  My goal is to continue my walk.
10.  SnootyFace comes with her pitbull and yells, ""Are you serious!"" at me as her dog is jumping in the air, snarling, and lunging at my dogs.  I pull my dogs, who are jumping, back.
Reddit - I love pitbulls and that's not really the point of me saying this part.  He is a BIG BOY and could easily shred my two babies, who are about 50 pounds each, a golden retriever, and the other is a collie cross.  
11.  After she passed, I hightailed it straight into my condo and cried.  I could not continue to walk and felt both afraid and set up. 

I feel so targeted and unsafe.  I am shaking as I write this, and I am genuinely afraid of future similar moments, them targeting me through the HOA, and living in a hostile living environment.  I feel like I did everything in my control to de-escalate the situation in a civil manner, and was just completely assaulted.  I am not used to living in unsafe environments and don't understand the unwarranted aggression.  I am a creature of habit and really easy to avoid as a direct result.  I walk my dogs at the same times every day, which makes me feel almost suspicious that they were waiting for me right outside my condo.  

My next steps are:

1.  Sending this email to you to create a paper trail and inform you of my side of the situation.  I'd be shocked if SnootyFace or OlderLady didn't say something to you, considering the last HOA meeting I was at, SnootyFace was having a fit about somebody else.  This seems to be her style.  
2.  Contacting a lawyer to begin a file to further protect my safety when engaging in the common grounds in relation to my property.
Reddit - This is a total joke...I'm a school teacher and worried about affording food right now.  No lawyers unless they take hugs as payment.  
3.  From this night onward, the length of the leash will be shortened to 4 feet or less to further protect my dogs.  Both dogs will be on gentle leaders and martingale collars to further discourage pulling.  Every day they get their training, and this will continue.  
4.  Continuing documenting my dog walks for our safety via video/audio.  
5.  Any further aggression will result in my calling of the police to support legal consequences

I am not even sure what to ask for from the HOA.  If you have any advice, I am very much open.  I appreciate you and apologize for the length of this email.  

- For Reddit:  

Welp?  What do you think?  Do you know anything about my rights, how to protect my dogs, dog walking equipment/training ideas... really anything.  Please tear me to shreds if I'm totally in the wrong, but will you please also include a better way of handling things?  I am at a total loss.

The Alterra board is pleased to announce to shareholders the discovery that the Degasi crew is on an economically convenient route for the establishment of the phase gate. By using 4546B as a gravitational sling shot location we will be able to potentially test new scanning technology, secure a large insurance payout and potentially acquire more shares in the Degasi mining company per their third party rescue clause. 

As we are excited to announce this to share holders the general crew will not be informed to avoid bad crew morale if the scanner returns no signs of life. 

However to potentially improve worker satisfaction, and help the Degasi survivors acclimatize to civilized work environment again certain 4546B themed, HR approved phasings have been recommended based on known survival conditions on the planet.

Instead of: Whatever floats your boat. 
Consider: Whatever ballasts your Seamoth (tm)

I‚Äôm starving / My body‚Äôs bioreactor is empty 

You look tired/ Haha *you* look like you could use some coffee (tm)

Up shits creek without a paddle / Far from base with no seaglide 

After meetings encourage workers to come up with their fun water themed phrases so that making a natural space for the potential Degasi assets can be more natural and less forced. This can result in higher Degasi satisfaction scores and less HR workload but it‚Äôs also: FUN

Spent the last two days bed rotting and wanting to die, and today I'm up and dancing and cleaning the house and doing all the things. I'm so over these mood swings. For those interested: I'm 48, history of anxiety and depression, currently in perimenopause. Have been on lexapro for years, tried TMS, acute noise senstivity, shithouse cognitive skills, brilliant hyperfocus on stuff I enjoy and a history of job hopping. You know the drill.

I don't recall any major red flags when I was younger, although professionals may say otherwise.

Not because of the grief (I'm good at that part), but because I have ceased to be able to focus on anything remotely uninteresting or complicated. When people talk, I mostly hear ""words words words, words?' and absorb nothing. I seriously thought I was getting dementia, but then I heard about how menopause can exacerbate symptoms of ADHD.

1gz943w,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1gz943w/what_is_the_best_coffee_machine/,What Is The Best Coffee Machine?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been on quite a journey lately, testing out different coffee machines to find the perfect one for my daily caffeine fix. After months of research and hands-on experience, I thought I'd share my findings with you all.

Let me tell you, making the perfect cup of coffee at home isn't just about saving money (though that's a huge plus). It's about creating that perfect morning ritual and getting exactly what you want, every single time.

I've found that the best coffee machine really depends on your specific needs. If you're like me and need your coffee ASAP in the morning, you might want an automatic drip machine with a timer. But if you're into playing barista and crafting those fancy drinks, an espresso machine might be your thing.

Speaking of which, I recently discovered this amazing collection of coffee machines that cater to different preferences and budgets: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine. They've got everything from simple drip makers to fancy espresso machines.

Here's what I've learned makes a coffee machine truly great:
- Brewing temperature control (this is crucial for flavor)
- Easy cleaning (because who has time for complicated maintenance?)
- Durability (it should last more than just a few months)
- Customization options (sometimes you want it strong, sometimes not so much)
- Water filtration (trust me, it makes a difference)

One thing that really surprised me was how much the grinder matters. If you're serious about your coffee, look for machines with built-in grinders. Fresh grounds make a world of difference!

For those who are overwhelmed by all the options (I totally get it), I'd suggest checking out this curated list: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine. It helped me narrow down my choices based on my needs and budget.

Pro tip: Whatever machine you choose, always consider the cleanup process. I learned this the hard way with my first machine - spent more time cleaning it than actually enjoying my coffee!

Also, think about counter space. Some of these machines look compact in photos but turn out to be huge in real life. Made that mistake once, won't do it again!

I've found that investing in a good coffee machine actually saves money in the long run. Those daily coffee shop runs really add up! Plus, there's something satisfying about mastering the art of making your perfect cup at home.

Remember, the best coffee machine is the one that fits YOUR lifestyle. Whether you're a simple drip coffee person or an aspiring home barista, there's something out there for everyone.

What's your experience with coffee machines? Would love to hear your thoughts and recommendations in the comments!",1,1732503842.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

For context I'm 36 Trans mtf, the person I was talking to is 35/36 m. We use to be ""friends"" in 5th or 6th grade and it was short lived after he and another boy starting bullying me and I  moved to another state. I moved back my junior year of high school and never associated with the kids from my old neighborhood or got real close with people at school including him. I chose to be a loner and focus on graduating since I had nothing in common with the others.

We had just sort of mutually reconnected and found each other on a dating app within the last couple of months. We  had had a couple run ins over the years but no actual talking. He had also sent a friend request on Facebook a couple years after graduation, but I didn't accept it after remembering the bullying. 

Since I am Trans, I always make it clear to people that I am for those who may be interested. I am also clear that I am only looking for conversation, meeting for coffee and nothing sexual or romantic. I know the irony. 

On the app I made the mistake of thinking we could be adults and I said ""hello"" and he replied. We talked for a minute and he told me about the people from the old neighborhood and some kids from school. I honestly told him that I didn't remember the people he mentioned or others from school. I also don't talk to people from my past including family for obvious reasons. He was not understanding of my reasons for cutting them loose and the reasons for wanting to forget my past childhood. 
 
I came clean about me being Trans and hiding it since childhood and little things that I've done but nothing in depth other than the typical teenage angst and partying and how it got old after turning 21 for me. I also made it clear of my intention for conversation only and how if anything becomes sexual I will shut it down right away with him and other users. 

He for the most part brought up the past a lot and sounded depressed through his messages. He eventually went quiet for a little bit and I out of curiosity checked on him. He replied with short replies, so I kept my distance. 

I replied this weekend after finding out another user was pretending to be me and sharing private information and my address. This user, i turned down after our first coffee meet due to bad vibes and him being overly sexual. I asked if he had dealt with the catfish user and if some of my information was shared with him. I even apologized if that user had made him feel uncomfortable or made nasty remarks or asked for adult pictures. Luckily nothing was shared so I thought I was in a safe situation. I kept apologizing for the other user.

Today, I said hello and tried to smooth over the situation with asking how his weekend was and if he had plans for Thanksgiving. I mistakenly asked if he was ""hosting "" family or friends and made a bad joke and asked if he got ""rowdy"" at holiday dinners. He went into a deep rant over the use and definition of both words. I agreed it was poor word choice and said repeatedly I should not have asked those questions. 

He never dropped his rants and I kept saying I should not asked and wanted to drop the conversation. Nothing seemed to cool it down until I mentioned it was better we quit communicating. He agreed. 

I made a honest comment about not talking to people from my past because of this reason. 

His last text is "" should have used different words""

 Then when I  was in Jr High, he told my sisters and I that he no longer believed In the church. He still goes to church because  he says ""Its a good family activity"" but I frankly think it's  to appease my mother. I remember hearing her scream at him about our family falling apart (me and none of my sisters being active, he also was struggling with drinking) because he had lost his faith, and that he had so many blessings before.

 This would happen when it seemed like he actually voiced his opinion and so i think he learned to just not talk about his side of things. Ive also tried to voice my opinions about the church to her and it always end in her yelling and crying.

I dont think my dad has fully deconstructed mormonism because he still considers him culturely mormon and likes the community (It makes sense him being a straight white man, It serves him somewhat). I also think he can't fully deconstruct unless he divorced my mom, I dont think that  would ever happen.

 She's alot more chill now after I've  moved out. My sister's aren't forced to go to church. I was made to go until I was 18. Only one does to help in nursery as they are the nursery teachers.

Told me I took advantage of him, even though I never asked him for ANYTHING... and I always bought our coffees and gave him a playstation 5 for christmas (side note he didn't give me anything). He claimed I was infatuated.. but i just considered him a good friend - I've given up on finding love. but i thought he was my best friend and told him as such.  He used to call me sis.. and love.... he told me to ""stop thinking it's all about me"" but I've never thought anything was about me.  told me 'we're friendly but not friends' even though I thought of him as a brother. and I told him as such previously. I have the message telling me to meet him at barnes and noble so we could talk.. and the message he sent me saying he had an emergency and couldn't.. and he wouldn't reschedule.  I kept those horrible messages.. because I thought maybe they'd help me to get over it.  This was from late June.  And the last thing I ever heard from him was late August.. everyone always tells me just to.. get over it. forget him.   but my mind is literally not letting me.  I think of him everywhere.  At work, where we met... where we always had our breaks together during good times.   At home, watching twitch when someone plays terraria (which we played together a couple times) the whole reason I got my gaming computer was so I could play games with him.  why am i like this.  why is this the way it is?  I know he was outright cruel.  and I want to believe it's not my fault.  Everyone tells me it's not my fault...  All I did was message him... he didn't even respond most the time.  But then I think back on the good days when we'd message eachother every day and we'd have coffee together in the morning and the time before when we'd work together and talk to eachother and break together.. and... I've never had a friend i was that close to before....  and then he just... stabs me in the back.  he treated me like I'm a monster.  what's wrong with me.  I'm in therapy but it's just not helping.  I was telling a coworker this morning that if he did one thing... it was to teach me I couldn't trust anyone. I don't even want friends anymore.  i wish I could talk to him one more time... i just want to understand why.  what changed... what did i do wrong...?  am i really that bad a person?  i tried so hard... i miss his hugs and how it always felt like.. all those broken parts were being squeezed back together every time he'd give me a hug and tell me things would be ok.  i miss him so much. 

How do you keep going when you just.. dont' see a point.  I waited 42 years to find a friend.. a person I thought was a REAL friend.. and just like that it's over.. I don't want to keep going.  i don't see a point.. I'm all alone.  nobody wants me. nobody needs me.  and my best is never good enough.. why bother.",1,1732503084.0,autism,1,1.0,False

im attempting to mimic the look of using, coffee and rough bit of wood.

im trying to get the brush to pool when you stop moving  
and get darker as it pools or you move slower.  
sort of like a burn tool but also a water colour brush.   
one example is doing zig zags and having target rounder corners similar to how the gel pen brush behaves on the ends of the stroke.

I‚Äôve been playing with it for days, the image bellow is as close as I‚Äôve gotten with some unexpected properties, the neon colours happen if you move fast and light, the thickness increases with pressure but so does the darkness. Bellow is two colours a blue and orange I want the slower lighter lines to be less opaque and more water colour, with faster scratching to loose ink, but become thinner.   
Slower=thicker  
faster=thinner

thats been an annoying on to figure out, as I can do the opposite but I don‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt invert it. That and the pooling When stopped And touching.

I am tired. I love you so much. But today, I am tired of fighting my family. It was your mistake, your lie, it's yours to fix. I am not capable of fighting this alone. I need you here with me.

When we met 3 years ago on a 27th, you said: I am gonna see you again.

I laughed and said good night.

A year later, on a 27th again, you were flying to my country to visit me. We both fell in love. Like a movie story saying goodbye and crying. I was thinking about you all the time. Every time my phone would light up I'd be excited by the thought of you messaging me.

There we go, it's a 27th, and we're seeing each other again.

Between flights overseas, long facetime calls, summers spent together and all of the roadtrips, I realized I was the luckiest girl ever, I found you, by accident on a 27th. I found a best friend, a travel partner, a lover, a let's run and have coffee kind of person, a seize the day kind of guy, a never look back just do your best person. I found you. You were my person. You still are. This is why it's sad. You are my soulmate and we went wrong.

How did we go wrong,? I was your number one fan. I believed so hard in you. I still do. but when you lied about your life I broke into a thousand pieces.

I am sorry. Sorry for me, for you and him. I am sorry he doesn't get to have a father. I understand he was a mistake. You should've told me. You should've tried to open up to me. To talk to me about it. I would've understand it. I actually understand it, I believe everything you say. I understand why you didn't tell me, why you weren't ready. I understand how the past was traumatic to you and how I was a breath of fresh air as you say. I hear you and I see all the efforts you are doing every day. I believe when you say you regret not telling me.

I am still sad. Sad because I love you. I love you because it's stronger than me. It's pulling me towards you everyday.

I may be delusional, crazy and blindly in love with you, I might not be seeing clearly right now, but family is right. Why should I be the one moving abroad when it was your lie. It's your turn to come here and fix it, to show them, to tell them how much you love me and you don't want to lose me. Do it for me.

Come live here with me. Please do. We will show them together how we're each other person and that no matter what happens we don't give up on us. We can finally be together and stop day dreaming of this life. We can have it.

I don't want to give up on us. I think it's only fair if you do the move now. I want my family to know that I am safe with you. Then wherever you want to go, I'll follow you. We'll see the world together like we always said. We'll do all of the roadtrips we planned. and go to Asia for the first time together. Get that Dalmatian dog, and see all the coastline of your country.

It's soon the 27th again, I'm going to you one more time. I'll make sure I'll lean in for a forehead kiss. I'll lay on you and listen to your heartbeats for a little longer. I'll cherish the morning kiss and the coffee you always make me. I'll hug you a little harder and longer. I'll smell you t-shirt a bit more. I won't complain when you'll play in my hair and mess it. I'll take it all in, one more time. I am scared it will be the last time.

If you truly love me, like you always tell me ""you're my greatest love, or my biggest heartbreak"" then you will move here for a bit. Because if you wanted to be with me, you would.

Then, I'll be yours.

ily forever xx

1gz8rkc,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1gz8rkc/patience_is_key_kendu_inu_is_here_for_the_longterm/,"Patience is Key, Kendu Inu is here for the long-term.","It's been said from the start, Kendu Inu was created to be a multi cycle project.  The price action that we are witnessing now for the project is crucial for creating a proper distribution of tokens so that long term growth is achievable.  Consider it an opportunity of a lifetime to be able to enter a project as established and committed as Kendu at these levels.  Here's a very brief look into the ecosystem if you are not familiar.

**Facts**

* We are the cusp of having 15K holders
* Kendu is almost 10 months old
* We rank top 10% in subreddit size
* We have an NFT platform that is still yet to be fully deployed
* Kendu is on ETH but will bridge to SOL (and most likely other chains such as BASE)
* Coinbase Wallet featured Kendu in their advertisement (every other coin featured in the same advert is now listed on Coinbase)
* We have Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu jewelry, Kendu merch, and much more.
* We have had several articles written about us in Shib Magazine
* Kendu Miazaki (dev of Kendu) is going to be speaking at Shibcon about Kendu
* We hit an ATH of 280M back in June before the bullrun even started
* We have the best organic community in the space, bar none

Why is all of this relevant?  I'm sure many of you have seen Bitcoin rise to historic levels these past few weeks, which according to past cycles, marks the start of the ""bullrun"".  Right now, it is likely that we will see Bitcoin continue to rise above 100K and dominate the crypto market.  Once Bitcoin dominance falls off, we will then see the true Altcoin season begin and with how things have turned out, it's highly likely this bullrun will be massive.

We are still in the prestages of a full fledged parabolic memecoin season and now is the perfect time to enter projects like Kendu who have firmly established themselves in the space and are entering the late stages of a major retracement phase.  Now is not the time to chase green candles, it's the time to accumulate dips and get in on established projects BEFORE they explode; that is if you want to make actual life-changing money this bullrun.

There is a rising figure in the crypto space that goes by MustStopMurad and I feel what he says will ring even more true when this cycle ends.

""You are NOT investing in Memes. You are investing in PEOPLE. The Key is to find Communities that have:  
\- Inspired people hustling daily  
\- 6+ months old  
\- Survived multiple large drops  
\- Holder Count growing every month  
\- $20 Billion+ Target  
\- Great Distribution + Diamondhands""

Kendu Inu checks all these boxes and has grown to be the prime example of what it means to be a proper memecoin built to take full advantage of not only this cycle but future cycles as well.

Join the community and see first hand the dedication and grind we have no matter what the price action looks like.  Paper hands will waver, but true chads will be here until the end.

1gz8qfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/somalifood/?rdt=35701,"Somali traditional coffee ""Bun"" ","The Somali tradition of ""Bun"" coffee is a unique and flavorful preparation of coffee that is widely enjoyed across the country. Bun refers to the traditional Somali coffee, which is typically made from freshly ground Arabica beans, sometimes sourced from local farms. The coffee is often roasted with butter (ghee or clarified butter) and sometimes infused with spices such as cardamom, cinnamon, or cloves.

Key Aspects of Somali Bun Coffee:

1. Roasting in Butter: The coffee beans are roasted in clarified butter (ghee), which adds a rich, creamy flavor to the coffee and enhances its smooth texture. The use of butter in the roasting process is a distinctive feature of Somali coffee and gives it a unique taste compared to other coffee traditions.


2. Spices: Many variations of Bun include spices like cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves, which are added to the roasted beans to impart a warm, aromatic fragrance and complex flavor profile.


3. Serving: In Somalia, coffee is traditionally served in small cups, often accompanied by dates or sweets. It is a significant part of Somali social life, especially during gatherings and special occasions. The coffee is typically brewed strong and is enjoyed for its deep, rich flavor.



Cultural Significance:

Bun is more than just a beverage in Somalia‚Äîit is a symbol of hospitality and a central part of social gatherings. It is often served when guests visit, and preparing coffee in this traditional way is considered a sign of respect and a way to honor the guest. It also plays an important role in the cultural identity of the Somali people.

Similarities to Other Traditions:

The practice of roasting coffee with butter is similar to other regional traditions, such as in Ethiopia, where coffee is often roasted in a similar manner and served with butter. However, Somali Bun is distinct in its use of ghee and the specific mix of spices that reflect local flavors.

For those interested in recreating this rich and flavorful coffee at home, the key is to use high-quality Arabica beans, clarified butter, and a mix of spices (if desired). It's a beverage deeply tied to the Somali way of life, offering a window into Somali culture and hospitality.

Very bland and flat compared to the other beans.,"Hey caffeinated folks, I just ordered from Dak for the first time and made a big order of 8 different beans to get free international shipping. About half are weird processing, half ""normal"" beans.

After 2 weeks rest I've started to crack them open. The ones I've tried so far have mostly had really loud and clear flavor notes and aromas - Coco Bongo in particular is giving me exactly what's written on the bag and it's pretty crazy.

When I tried to brew Milky Cake though, it gave me... nothing. No distinctive aroma before or after grind, or during brewing. After brewing, the cup was bland and flat with mild acidity, and a very generic, slightly vegetal light roast coffee flavor. Nothing spicy, cakey, or unique whatsoever.

Brew is a typical 4:6 V60 recipe, ground on a ZP6 at around 5.0, 93C 1:16 ratio, TWW.  

I've read that you need to rest it longer (3 weeks at least), but it's crazy to me that these flavors would develop in one more week where there are literally none present at 2.

Not gonna lie, it was devastating for me. What killed me was when I went into the apartment we used to share (with his permission) to get some of my things and saw a note on the coffee table that made it obvious that he was already seeing someone else. I actually had a bad emotional breakdown in front of him because it was so painful to be so quickly replaced and I felt like I had never meant anything to him. 

About three days later he did ask me to come over and we talked about what would be important for us to improve the relationship and actually got back together. I asked him if he had slept with this woman as this was sort of important to me, which he denied. According to him it was just a date. This was about three weeks ago.

So I was staying with him in ""our"" shared apartment since then where most of my things still were (I had only gotten essentials out before as I have no car) and I went to look for something in a kitchen drawer. In there, I found the pack of condoms that we had bought together when I decided to get off birth control about a year prior, but never ended up using as he didn't like condoms. Well .. the pack was open and only 4 out of 10 condoms were left. I asked him about it, and he said he used them for himself. He didn't explain this further and having just gotten back together, I decided not to pry. 

The thought wouldn't leave me though and I started wondering if he still texts her or sees her. My gut feeling was heavily triggered. I felt uncomfortable in the apartment knowing she had been there and not really knowing if they had had sex in our bed, on our couch etc. So on Friday night, I decided I have to bring this up if I want to move forward in a healthy way and was seeking reassurance. I was waiting in our/his apartment for him to come home after work. I texted him that this woman was still heavy on my mind and what had been going on with them, and that I was worried he might still be in touch with her or see her and that i don't see a way how he used to condoms himself, but he denied the first two questions, didn't say anything about the third, and got annoyed with me for asking this yet again. At the same time I noticed he took an unusually long time to come home. It takes 10, 15 minutes with lots of traffic to drive from work to home, but it took him 50. When he came back, I actually apologized to him for making him upset and he was distant the rest of the evening. 

Saturday was normal. Oh Sunday morning, today, my gut feeling was spinning out of control and I did something I usually never do, but he obviously wouldn't give me the truth. For the first time in my life I decided to check his phone while he was in the shower. 

And there it was. not only was he still in touch with her, those 40 minutes detour? He went to see her. According to the messages, he wanted to bring her back her ""toys"" she had left at his place. She asked ""in the parking lot same time as always?"" It was pretty clear that he massively underrepresented whatever they had by saying he ""had a date"". The messages were extremely sexual. On the day we had gotten back together, he texted her that he wanted to take a step back from their relationship and find himself. He didn't mention me. But he kept texting with her regardless, including her sending photos of body parts, and some BDSM style photos which he liked with a red heart emoji. I wanted to throw up.

I knocked on the bathroom door and when he opened I threw his phone in his face and called him a liar and a cheater. He seemed unphased, continued doing his hair. I left, and he texted me that we should have never gotten back together and was only because I had begged him to. It was a mistake because it will always end up like this. He says when we got back together he deleted the apps and her chat (which... No? You didn't?) and then I go and pull ""this shit"". He said he never cheated.  He said I can't be mad and judge him for what he did when we were separated, completely ignoring the fact that he actually saw her in person at the very moment I texted him that I was worried if he was still in touch with her. He didn't even say sorry. He just didn't care. 

Now it's 3 am where I live and I haven't eaten all day but had 3 drinks and can't sleep. I guess he texted her right back that he had found himself and was ready to boink his brains out with her. I didn't want to cry and I was doing alright until now. I wish I could just sleep and never wake up. How can you be so wrong about the man you thought was the love of your life? It hurts so much and I don't know how to make it stop.

I‚Äôd like to ask you about pain I developed after getting a cavity filled 5 days ago. Prior to the filling I wasn‚Äôt feeling any pain. My doctor said the cavity was pretty deep and we needed to monitor how it evolved.

Right after the procedure and after the anesthesia faded y started feeling intense pain, around a 6 out of 10 that decreased the next day. Day two and day three were very similar, in the intensity of pain, being a 2 out of 10. But today the pain intensified and has been consistently a 4 out of 10.

The pain doesn‚Äôt feel localized in the molar that was filled, but in the general area and weirdly enough it feels mirrored in the directly inferior molar. 

Temperature sensitivity has been high, sensitivity to touch has been moderate. I‚Äôve avoided all crunchy foods, and chewing on the side that the filling was done, but I‚Äôve been brushing and flossing as usual without any discomfort. 

Thanks for reading! Have a good one.

And then there‚Äôs the whole LOR thing. When people say, ‚ÄúI have strong LORs,‚Äù are we talking about:

1. The person writing it is a big shot (like, Professor McFancyPants from Ivy League U)?

Everything in the house has to be clean and tidy in a specific way. I am not a big person when it comes to change. The biggest change that I've gone through recently is getting bangs and that took MONTHS of convincing to do. My mom got rid of the old recliner in our family room, our coffee table in our living room, and our dining table in our kitchen and replaced them all with either newer or smaller versions that she likes more. When doing this she has completely rearranged our house, this has flowed into my room and I like my room messy because then she wont come in here. It overwhelms her so she hates being near my room. She decided that she was going to take a ton of my sisters old stuff that she left before moving out and arrange it in my room. When my sister moved out she asked me if I wanted anything and I told her no. I hate halloween and my sosters favorite holiday is halloween, so I don't want any of her decor. Something that is my genuine solitude for hard times is baking. I love baking. I also have really really bad knees (at 17) and go to physical therapy 3 days a week and visit my orthopedic doctor once a month (this is important). In this surge that my mom had, she took all of our spices from the cabinet above our stove (I cant reach that without a stool, that i have to get on my knees to climb) and put them in our pantry, well she made room for this by putting my baking stuff in the cabinet above the stove. I know you may be thinking, ""this is perfect, you have your own cabinet"" except I am a 5'6 girl in a house made for 6'3-6'5 people. I need to climb a lot to get up there and I havent been able to recently because of my knees. I havent been having a good day today and this tipped my boat over and I locked myself in my room and started crying. Not to mention, every piece of clothing that I had in my room was on the floor because my mom didny want to ""step over baskets"" to put my sisters decor in the farthest corner of my room from my door.",1,1732501872.0,TrueOffMyChest,5,0.67,False

You find him getting changed and he tries to lie for protection,"Nia realized in high school that as a male omega, he was at the bottom of the food chain in terms of treatment. Even female omegas were treated better than he was, all it took for him to realize it was ruthless bullying that persisted until he switched to online classes, graduating from the protection of a computer screen. So, as soon as he graduated, Nia threw away his gender identity in favor of a front that he felt kept him safe. He lived his public life as a woman and private life as a man, and this method kept him safe. It worked, no one knew. At least until you walked in on him changing his shirt after spilling coffee all over it. Panicked, Nia knew he needed to throw you off his trail, to keep his secret safe, but would he be able to? Would you buy it? He could only hope.

Wanted to ask if you know of any local roaster that sell smaller bags (preferably in the 50-100g range). I've tried a few e.g. Primal Brew (love the Kenya Kiambu), Coffellera, and Sibs.

Been looking to try to explore more international and local single-origin coffee but I find it hard to commit to buying 250g bags since I like cycling through multiple bags within a week (also, I've had some pretty unsatisfying experiences with some local roasters) so I'm just looking for recommendations.

I don't live in the metro so I can't regularly visit specialty cafes/roasters often to try their offerings.

Since we were having fun I suggested we move to the bar next door for a drink and he accepted. We had a great conversation, had a drink each and he ordered some charcuterie. Since our date was at 4, I figured I would make plans with my bestie since her husband was out of town and let him know beforehand. I left our date at around 7 and we agreed to keep texting and make plans to see each other again. During our date I mentioned that we were going out to a restaurant with my gf and maybe a bar afterwards. Later that evening while I was out I noticed he texted me on Hinge to tell me he had a great time and giving me his phone number and asking me to text me (we hadn't exchanged phone numbers beforehand). I was about to text him back to say I had a great time as well and couldn't wait to see him again, but I kept getting interrupted by my friend and ended up forgetting about it (I have mild ADHD and I can get overwhelmed and forgetful). The next day (so today) I wake up with a hangover (we had lots of fun last night and ended up going dancing) so I woke up at noon. My first thought when I woke up was to text him so I go on the app and I was shocked to see he had unmatched me and I didn't save his number.
