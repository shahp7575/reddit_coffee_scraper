I was wondering, i had a Migraine with Aura (No headache, just the visual issue) once, and since then around 5 times over 2 years (Maybe coffee related as one was after a client gave me a non decaff coffee)  and since then I've had this problem.  Did the Aura 'break' something, almost like a stroke etc?  I've got / had anxiety in the past, and had SSRI's etc. Most of the money common answers to that chaps survey, i was in which gave me reassurance with things, but i was just wondering.

Booking: Did it online through their website (jett.com.jo). Pretty straightforward, got a confirmation email. Booked like a week before my trip, no issues.
Pickup: They have two options - Abdali station or 7th Circle. I did Abdali since it was closer to my hotel. Easy to find, just showed up 15 mins early.
Timing: Bus left exactly on time at 6:30 AM. Got to Petra around 10.30 AM. Came back on the 5 PM bus, reached Amman by 9:10 PM.
The ride: Bus was comfortable enough. AC worked, seats recline a bit, clean. I slept through most of it honestly. They stop for 20 mins each way at this rest area - bathroom break and you can grab coffee or snacks.
Cost: Around 20 JOD round trip. Way cheaper than the tour packages which are like 90-110 JOD for basically the same thing.
Time at Petra: Had from 11 AM to 5 PM there. That's 6 hours which was more than enough to see everything, including hiking up to the Monastery (which you should absolutely do btw).
Overall: Would recommend if you're doing Petra as a day trip. It's reliable, way cheaper than tours, and gives you the flexibility to do your own thing at Petra instead of being stuck with a group.
Front seats are better if you get motion sick. Bring water and some snacks. That's about it.

Alright, here’s the rundown: married guy, dad of two kiddos, and cohabitating with two fluffy doggos (one being a golden troublemaker who thinks “sit” is a suggestion). Currently soaking up the NC sunshine and loving this lovely transition into sweater weather….

Sundays are my sweet spot…slow mornings, coffee with some tasty creamer, errands staring me in the face, and maybe firing up the grill because mmmm grilled tacos. If I end the night with a drink on the patio, fire going, pretending to reflect on my life choices…the day was a win!

I love good energy, engaging chats, that spark when a conversation just hooks you in. The kind where you read a message, smirk, and instantly think of your reply.

I play a little hockey, lift just enough to maintain my “not bad for a dad” physique, and will absolutely craft a charcuterie board that looks like I’m auditioning for the food network… before eating half of it myself. And yes, avocado toast is the key to my heart. 

Anywho, if you’re still down here reading then it’s definitely worth a hello right???

Entry 8 

August 31^(st). 

“Can you stop reading that GOD awful self-help book already!” The gambler blurted out, directed at the African American man. “I’m so tired of hearing about it all!” 

“Let me read in peace please” was his response.  

“Constant! Louder and louder! Your terrible books, the girl's stupid home, the woman's annoying family!” the gambler pointed a moving excusatory finger at each of them “I’ve had enough! And don’t even get me started on this senile old man, always thinking about the stupid fucking sunflowers!” His anger now directed at the most fragile one in the group. The Singaporean sat at the table, staring at nothing. Some more yelling was done before he struck the innocent man, nothing too harsh, just a smack behind the head. We called security to calm the situation down. 

This is how the conflicts began, or something like this anyway. The point is the old man shut down mentally and refused to speak. We did multiple checks on the man, and he was physically healthy, but something wasn’t right mentally. We couldn't get in contact with any of his family, so he stayed in our care. The gambler kept starting fights, nothing extreme, but eventually causing security to step in every now and then. The large dark man that once stood tall and confident had shrunk to a mouse that only read. The two women in the room were inseparable. They huddled together constantly and sometimes whispered reassurance to each other. Clearly these people were miserable, and the effects of whatever happened to them were causing complications. And yet they stayed. Some refused the idea of leaving, the gambler for one kept raving about getting his money, some just seemed to stay because the others did. We kept them there and watched them.  

The morale in the office wasn’t good. At work and in our quarters, we were often silent, lost in our work or our own thoughts. Sometimes me and Craig would confine in each other, questioning our life choices, sometimes laughing about it. I believe the girls did the same thing. Sometimes I’d talk to Gabriella. Sweet conversations about our innocent youths.  

“As I said, I was always a science nerd, so it makes sense I ended up in a place like this. But you? How does a sporty outdoors man like yourself wind up in this spot? I mean, what happened to all the camping and rock climbing you spoke so fondly of?” She asked with a giggle. That kind of positivity hadn’t been seen in these rooms for a long time. 

“Oh, come on. That was a lifetime ago.” I responded. 

“College was a lifetime ago? It feels like yesterday for me. How old are you Mr. Miller?”  

I was so caught up with her soft sweetness I had forgotten of our age gap. The realization admittedly shocked me; I paused while taking a sip of my coffee. 

“I’m sorry Mr. Miller, how rude of me.” She said, face blushed bright pink. 

“No, no. It’s alright. I’m 50.” If I had to say a guess of her age, I'd say Gabreilla was around early 30’s. If I was willing to admit I stalked her file, I’d say she was exactly 28 as of 5 months ago. Believe it or not watching crazy people all day every day gets boring so sometimes you gotta fill the gaps between disturbing incidents with finding out the details of your coworkers. Don't judge me. Anyway, after that the joyful conversation turned awkward, so she returned to her work, and I returned to my second cup of coffee. 

 To be honest, I think we were scared, although we didn’t admit it. Scared for these people and for ourselves. We would try to busy ourselves with work and idle conversation, but at one point or another we aways had to come back and address the elephant in the room. This is roughly when my nightmares started, so even in sleep, I could not rest. 

I would dream of them. They took me to a shore in the middle of the night, strange moons hung above. They were talking to me all at once, different things but occasionally their sentences would align in a few words or phrases. They blamed me. For their situations, before the experiment, and after. Somehow it was all my fault. They'd surround me and the noise would strain my ears even if I tried to cover them.  Eventually the stress and pressure would wake me up. We all had nightmares from time to time, us and the subjects. It was normal.

Entry 9 

I saw her outside my window two nights ago.  

I collapsed on the ground at who knows what time, not asleep but not awake. My knees just seemed to have given up just as much as I had. It’d be hypocritical of me to force them up and continue my binge drinking into the night. So, on the floor I stayed. Until a sobering knock had risen me from my state. Just one swift knock, not even at my door, I don’t know where it came from. I steadied myself, eyes darting around the dimly lit space, the air thick with the stench of alcohol. I stood in the center of my room and listened, liquid confidence preparing me to strike at anything, hands open and at the ready, like a drunken fool. The knock was sharp, deliberate, and it still echoed in my mind, as if it had come from all around me. I couldn’t place it. Not the door, not the walls - just the sound, lingering.  

My breath was slow and heavy as I slowly shambled to the window and peered through the blinds. On the second floor of my motel, I got a clear view of the cold street below, flickering with moths and broken streetlamps. Among the noisy visage of the night I noticed a static outline, barely visible through the blinking lamp above. I focused and strained until a figure emerged from this shape. Curves and long, dark hair. Another knock, its origin still in question, rattled throughout my room, making me flinch. Yet it could not drag my attention away from her for long. Across the street, almost entirely adjacent to my room, motionless, she stood. My gaze fixed on her, following the contour of her body, desperately attempting to define some detail. 

Suddenly another knock came and with it a snap of her neck as she tilted her head. She was looking directly at me. I didn’t breathe. Didn’t blink. The streetlight flickered again, casting her face into brief, haunting clarity. Pale skin, dark eyes that seemed to pierce right through me, like she knew my every thought, every secret. It's Gabriella. There she was under the light of a streetlamp, her long brunette hair slouched down and covered some of her face, but I still knew it was her, unmistakably so.  

A coward I am, of course, I shut the blinds, slid down the wall and sat on my ass until it left, or I passed out.

Entry 10  

Around late September is when I no longer could consider them human.  

They’d often say things simultaneously which caused them to cut each other off and start and stop sentences. Any form of out loud communication was a frustrating mess. Until they stopped speaking all together. A confused chaos slowly dying down into silence. Silence for us, however, I’m sure the concoction of voices continued beyond the veil of their minds. 

Their undesirable financial situations taken advantage of as we dangle a paycheck in front of them, just so we could do as we please to them, their bodies, and their minds. 

One day I just stared at them with pity and anxiety. As close to the window as I could get, I focused on these poor people and couldn’t help but think that they were eerie. The deepest point of the uncanny valley, the thalweg of it. “For some reason,” I thought. “Maybe it’s the look in their eyes, I don’t know, I just don't think they’re human anymore.” 

“But we are human.” They spoke in monotoned unison. Just as I processed what they had said, I noticed that they had all stopped and begun staring through the one-sided glass. No, not just past the glass, but at me. Each test subject was staring directly into my eyes! Panic and fear instantly formed within me. My palms moistened and I froze. As did the observing room.  Even more eyes had befallen upon me, I was surrounded by puzzled expressions. I was the center of everyone's attention. They answered me. 

“What was that about?” Craig directed his question at me. They looked over at Craig. Our microphone was certainly off, yet even if it was on that doesn’t explain how they answered me. This wasn’t right. I thought they were only supposed to connect with each other. I didn’t sign up for this. 

“Arthur?” Alexa was just as confused. I turned to them and refused to live in denial. 

“They read my thoughts.” I confessed. We could do nothing but write an incident report, continue our notes, and follow up with more tests. We tried to get them to do it again, but they were mostly unresponsive. 

It was around this time they started sleeping together. They pushed a few of their beds together and packed in like sardines. Soon to be like tuna. They sometimes kissed each other and murmured together. 

Days later, without further incident, I awoke from one of my usual nightmares. In the dead of night, I approached the monitoring system. Splayed out on a few monitors I watched them sleep. I wish I had just stayed in bed, at least then maybe I would've been able to sleep that night. They weren’t asleep, just pretending to be. Through the white noise of our speakers, barely picked up by the microphones in their room, the test subjects hummed together once again. 

“You harbor a great guilt, Mr. Miller.” 

I went to bed and begged and pleaded to some higher being that I could just fall asleep and forget all of this. Sleep did not come. 

The following day I buried these memories and tried to find solace in idle small talk about anything else. Craig somehow looked and acted even more like a corpse than before, Alexa made it very clear that she did not want to speak to me, so I approached Gabriella. She was deep in her notes once again. I’ve noticed Gabriella’s once pristine notes now lie in ruin. Barely legible chicken scratches cover the pages. Her beautiful hair is now tangled and knotted. She smells. As I greet her, she slams her book shut and nervously replies   
“M-Mr. Miller? Hello! Sorry I was just...” she was frazzled. Something was different about her, more than the obvious, something within. “Yesterday, they spoke to you... have you ever spoken back?” What could she possibly mean by this? The subjects, the look in her eyes, I wanted no part in it.   
“No.” is all I said, before leaving and getting back to work. 

All they do anymore is sit together, silent. They wear each other's clothes, sometimes they don't wear anything. They eat each other's food, occasionally “baby birding” food to each other, as Gabriella put it. Soon we will contact whoever is closest to these people and let them know that they will not be coming back. We inform subjects not to allow any of their points of contact to know what they are doing or why they are missing. If things go wrong, they’re death is made to look like an accident, they’re chosen points of contact get notified of this first. It's rare, but such cases do happen. This will be one such case. They knew what they were signing up for. They are beyond help. 

Looking at them makes my head hurt.

Entry 11 

I’ve found the courage to leave my room and once again fled several towns over. I knew deep down that it was pointless as I made the decision but sitting in a room that had been visited too many times prevented even the briefest respite of sleep. The roads were quiet, and I almost found calm. Yet, as three hours and miles of road flew past my window, that calm would dissipate as I locked eyes with a hitchhiker. Although they weren’t really a hitchhiker, they had no bags, no sign, no outstretched hand with a rising thumb. Just their presence, which served as an accent mark upon an otherwise desolate horizon. His neck turned to trail my car, otherwise he was stationary. Perhaps I could’ve forgotten the experience if it hadn’t been repeated a mere two hours later. Another three hours and a man was standing in the middle of the road, unflinching as I narrowly swerved around them. Agents of that thing, I fear. Is it finally my time? Have they come for me? Why are they out here in the middle of nowhere? Why am I? 

I haven’t seen anyone else since, except for the motel owner. 

 

**04/10/25 - 1940** 

Entry 12? 

It was the 20^(th) of November. 1832hrs. 

The Heartful crescendo of a symphony meant to grace the chests of those in need of their fight or flight instincts drummed through my body, circulating adrenaline to each end of my being. Caused by a site that no human has come across before. My gut retched as evil began to form before me. 

The test subjects curled forward and began screaming. It started as a slow groan but only continued to get louder and louder. 

“What's the matter?! What do you feel?!” Craig barked at the microphone. Their only response was further agonizing screams. Slowly, they began to slug to each other, tearing off their clothes. Throats were audibly carving as their mournful wails slowly synchronized in dreadful harmony. They came together in a sweaty embrace. I could notice melting skin sticking and stretching out to hold the hands of the others, warmly longing and sinking into a sickening fusion. They broke their bones just to get closer, flesh tore, eyes popped and melted. Biting and clawing at each other, fingering and digging into their wounds. They spat and drooled and cried and bled. I don't know how, but they truly began to melt. A slow, horrific process where we could do nothing but observe. They pushed each other in, like clothes in an already full suitcase, any piece hanging out angrily shoved back in. By the time security showed up to try and pull them apart it seemed it was too late, the task impossible. Only Alexa had the confidence to lurch her food from her stomach onto the floor, the rest of us suspended in fear. The guards slowly backed away, looking to us for an explanation. 

Eventually it seemed their enfoldment had ceased. They were molding each other into one; their skulls were formed atop one another unevenly, layered like conjoined quintuplets. The details of their faces were lost. Not a single eye survived the merge, yet each of their jaws did, although broken and shifted in wrong directions, their rows of fangs hiding behind one another, like a human shark. So large and dark and terrible, a night sky, each star a jutting tooth. Surrounding this void was what looked like an old, healed burn victim's skin, impossibly pale and desperately latching onto its now thickened cranium. There were two slits in the middle, a remnant, or perhaps an imitation, of a nose. It had no ears, at least none that would work. Some vague shapes of ears could be found around its head and neck, but they did not have any holes. Yet it still had some very small orifices scattered around its face. Maybe some sort of attempt at an evolutionary necessity to allow its skin to breathe. It had wet greasy strands of hair, although not many, as most were ripped out in clumps during their combination. If you look closely, you can tell that patches of flesh have molded over the top of a lot of their locks, like mounds of gum stuck on a woman's head. Its thick neck fumbled and folded into its enlarged body, which was thick, yellow, and mutilated, undulating and writhing, getting used to its new form. A fat mass of limbs of varying sizes. It had a main pair of arms and legs, the rest of their limbs were scattered and mostly engulfed. A finger here, a toe there, its left arm was a combination of two, seemingly the two younger males. A hand could be seen wrapped around its own neck, still twitching every now and then. Some hands and feet had extra digits, some had fewer. Some digits had nails, some didn’t, some had several. It sat there and breathed, chest heaving and falling, at first in jerks and spasm, but it soon found its rhythm.  

Stillness and mouths agape on our side of the glass. As if Medusa herself had laid her wicked curse upon all that observed this horrific scene. The fear and confusion crippled us. Alexa cried in her puddle of vomit. At this instance I knew this was not the work of science nor any righteous god. Before we knew what to do with ourselves, it spoke. Through its terrible jaws and the flaws that come with a new body it found its voice, through wheezes into splatters into groans into words, words that clawed and shambled out of the deepest part of its gullet.  

“We. Are. one.” 

Lives upon lives, uprooted and entangled together creating a mind-numbing concoction of consciousness. 

For a long time, it allowed us to study and contemplate what we would do next. Dozens of minutes of pointless deliberation until ultimately it decided it was done. We heard it again, but it did not speak. At first, it shared its pleasure and its understanding. It liked its news form. The presence of each other as one. They now knew themselves and were free from judgment. They were truly feeling bliss, and they gave us a taste of that feeling. It felt disgusting. Having this perverted creature wriggle its way into my mind. I felt violated. Next, it showed us the flaw of individuality. Our flaws. 

We saw Gabriella Anderson, looking at Arthur. At night she would think about him privately. She would then cry after. 

We saw Alexa Petrov driving, drinking. She hit a man. No one knew. She saw the funeral from a distance. A father. 

Craig Boris, disdain, regret. Arguing with his wife, Mitchelle Geneviève. Loving his wife. He blamed himself for her passing. He never wanted to be a father, and he told her so. 

Arthur Miller, sleeping with Mitchelle Geneviève. 

 

 

 

 

 

**?/?/? - 0000 hours** 

Entry ??? 

The letter belonged to Gabriella; the cleanliness of her handwriting is unmistakable. It’s a far cry from the mess of a page I’d last seen her scribble out. I finally had the courage to tear open and examine the innards of what had caused me so much anxiety and fear ever since I found it. And there it was, the tidy calligraphy that danced around the page sat before me. The choreography I’d seen Gabriella perform so many times before during our time at the observation room, this time, directed to me. 

 

Can you imagine how quiet the lab has become since you left? Every corridor feels a little emptier; every monitor is a little dimmer.   
 

Are you alright out there? All on your own. We can help each other you know.   
 

Remember the good times we had? All our little private chats. We can spend much more time together. Alone.   
 

Come back to us. It'll be a drastically different environment. We're happy. We’ll help them. We’ll help you. I know you’ll come back.   
 

Once you return, the process of developing treatment for our subjects will get underway.   
 

So, once you arrive, we’ll welcome you back with open arms. Let's fix what we did   
   
Arthur. We look forward to your return. - Gabi 

 

I know it's not from her, not really her. But it's a nice idea. That all will be well when I get back. But it won't be. Things will still be screwed in every way with everyone involved. Not like things are better here, wherever here is. 

I don’t even know who’s left. Fuck, for all I know there isn’t anyone who hasn’t been intertwined in that mental spider web. Knots and kinks and tangles of thoughts and people. It’s got Gabreilla, I know that much. 

I still feel it whispering to me. Peeling back the layers of my mind to molest my thoughts - my soul. It’s in there. I want to dig it out. Sometimes I lie awake at night, and I’m convinced I’m having thoughts that aren’t my own. 

I don’t know what it wants. I don't know why it showed us those things. Maybe I’ll try to find out.  

 

 

I think I’m going back. I can’t stop thinking about sunflowers. ",1,1763316469.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

The new grift appears to be black mold toxicity. I first noticed this trend when Jordan Benzo Peterson released a podcast on the subject some time ago, and recently Mikhaila Peterson has been focusing on it as an excuse as to why her necrovore diet is not working.

Upon searching Youtube for ""black mold hysteria"", and ""black mold toxicity debunked"", I was unable to find much in the way of exposing the grift that's starting become apparent, however I did notice that Dave Asprey (the genius who told people to put butter in their coffee) was also doing podcasts talking about the so-called ""black mold epidemic"".

If anyone has good links, videos, studies on the subject, please share it here in case others start to catch a whiff of the grifter spores. Maybe we can find the source. I suspect the 'elusive' nature of black mold ""affecting some, and not others"" has to do more with hypochondria, and people who have disordered eating, such as the people who went from raw vegan to carnivore, and every called failed diet trend. It seems like a way to prey on the mentally vulnerable who have too much money to spend.

Is it truly black mold toxicity, or is it simply hysteria? ",0,1763316296.0,ketoduped,1,0.33,False

I need all the advice I can get from before leaving U.S to the end of my time in Shanghai, to top places to stay in, visit and eat. 


Things I have done so far (iPhone):
- Downloaded WeChat & Alipay. Confirmed my identity already and added my cards.
- Downloaded DeepL

1. Any other apps I’d need? 
2. How far out should I start applying for a Visa? 
3. How much emergency $ cash should I bring? 
4. Is there a way to avoid the 3% card charge per transaction on Alipay? 
5. What VPN should I use? Do I need an eSIM? I have T-Mobile. 

Hotels: budget is up to $500/night. I do prefer luxury but it doesn’t need to be Bvlgari or the Peninsula, I just want good service, a clean and well decorated room. 

*** Is the IHG Wonderland worth visiting/staying for a night or two? If so, what can you do there besides watch the light shows?***

If you think 7 days in Shanghai is too long, please recommend some places nearby. Shanghai is busy, so perhaps something more calming and nature heavy. 

+++++++++++++++++

Food: No budget really lol. Is the immersive historical banquet experience worth it? The one where you can dress up? I want to hit up spots that I haven’t seen much on social media. Top tea and coffee shops (preferably with cold brew). We are spicy people so we can take it (and I mean like southeast Asian spicy). 

Attractions/Activities: any niche specific things I should check out that we might not have in the U.S? We’re in our 30s and would like to hit up some nice night scenes. 

Shopping: I’m looking for men’s stores that cater to men that are below 5’5”. 

Spas/Beauty: Which 24/hr spa is good for couples? Where can I get a really good facial? Hair salons? Including men’s. 

Is it better to get a private airport pick up over taxis? 

That’s all I can think of for now. The reason why I came here to ask these questions is because I can’t listen to one more influencer showing the same place over and over again but it sounds like they’re asking questions. Anyway, thanks in advance!

I signed up for Hiring Cafe two days ago while I was looking for free trade coffee beans and decided to actually follow their advice and apply to a bunch of roles in one go — I sent around 12 applications in the evening, mostly tech/remote roles. This is a bit different from my  previous approach of not applying for jobs which was successful in terms of not working but not so successful in terms of getting paid and performing duties per se.

This morning there was rain dripping from the bridge when I woke up and as I wiped it off my face and phone I noticed an email for a 30-min Zoom interview for next week. Not just a 10 minute phone screen by a HR drone, but an actual proper interview with the hiring manager because companies that hire through Hiring Cafe don't mess around -- they actually want to get you onboard as quickly as freshly netted tuna. After months of sending applications into the void -- now that I think of it, that might be why I didn't get any calls -- seeing a real response -- and boy is this oh so definitely real I'm not kidding around I didn't hallucinate this or dream it because it was still raining when I opened my phone -- this fast honestly shocked me a bit although now that I think of it I was shaving my wet face with a plugged in clothing iron so that could also have had something to do with the shock. lol. smh. rofl. haha.

I’m not saying this guarantees anything of course, since I may be living in a simulation, but compared to the 0 replies I was getting before after applying for every astronaut position at NASA by mailing my applications in brown envelopes addressed to 'the man in the moon', this already feels like progress.

Edit: I’m not affiliated with Hiring Cafe at all, just a random overachieving job seeker who’s tired and stressed like everyone else who has to beg for food under a bridge while it rains outside and I have definitely applied to over 10,000 jobs this year which divided by 365 days is about 1000 jobs per day, all of which were typed with my pinkie finger which is my best finger. Figured I’d share in case it gives someone a bit of hope that they too can earn millions of dollars by running in a three legged race against blind albinos.

I’m sitting with my phone face up, still open on chats that started with potential and ended with nothing. I try, I really do. I start conversations, ask people how their day went, try to actually get to know them instead of tossing out empty lines. Some reply once, some twice, and then it turns into that quiet slow fade where you can tell their interest slipped through their fingers the moment something more exciting appeared.

Sometimes I even joke with myself about how my conversations look like tiny graveyards. Names I tried to connect with, each one ending in a short reply or a seen message that goes nowhere. And I still keep trying, because the alternative is to stop trying altogether and that feels worse than the silence.

There are evenings I step out of the house just to feel less stuck. I’ll grab coffee or walk through the mall pretending I’m just clearing my head, when really I’m hoping to accidentally bump into someone who sees me the way I hope to be seen. I look around and watch friends taking pictures, couples leaning on each other, people laughing into their phones. I sit down somewhere and scroll so I don’t look like I’m waiting for someone who never shows up.

I’ve had moments where I tried going casual. Just to feel something. Just to break the monotony. But those moments always end the same way. The closeness disappears as fast as it came and leaves me with the same quiet room and the same thoughts I tried to shake off. I end up realizing I want more than a quick fix. I want a person, not an escape.
The strange thing is, tonight the loneliness didn’t hit me the same way.

It didn’t crush me or sit on my chest.
It made me think.
I realized that the ache I carry isn’t desperation. It’s honesty. It’s the version of me that I usually hide during the day because everyone expects men to keep their emotions locked away like some fragile secret.
But here’s the part that feels different now.
I’m not looking for someone to sweep in and give meaning to my life.
I’m crave for someone who meets me at eye level. Someone who tries back.
Someone who wants to stay, not out of convenience but because the connection feels natural.

Maybe she’s out there right now, scrolling through her own chats, wondering why nothing feels real anymore. Maybe she’s tired of shallow conversations and tired of being the only one who puts effort into anything. Maybe she’s dealing with the same kind of quiet that I’m sitting in. That thought alone shifts something in me.

Not in a dramatic way.
Just enough to make the room feel less heavy. So instead of wishing for someone to walk into my life tonight, I’m choosing something smaller but strangely comforting. I’m choosing to believe that lonely people don’t stay lonely forever. They eventually find their matching tired soul who still believes in genuine connection.

And maybe the right person won’t be the one who replies the fastest or says all the pretty things. Maybe she’ll be the one who doesn’t disappear.

The one who answers honestly.
The one who shows up consistently.
The one who feels real in a world full of people pretending to care.
That possibility is enough for tonight.
Not closure. Not certainty.
Just a quiet reminder that I haven’t run out of chances.
And somehow, that makes the loneliness feel a little less sharp.",1,1763316041.0,bumbleIndia,0,1.0,False

I had an idea to add more flavor to the game.



It could also help small and medium-sized businesses, since I have the feeling that game updates generally give more advantages to companies that are already at the top.



It's about the following: company cooperatives.



These cooperatives would have their own exchange where only the companies that are part of it could buy and sell.



(Obviously, this wouldn't prevent these companies from operating on the main exchange.)



How would it work? A certain number of companies would join to form the cooperative. The products traded within their exchange would NOT pay the 4% fee. (Would this prevent players from making contracts outside of it? I don't think so. Why? Because nothing implies that supply and demand would be equivalent, and, in fact, better deals could be obtained through contracts.)



What could be done to make this help smaller companies more and larger ones less? Perhaps some mechanism like the one applied to GO. High-tier companies could join in smaller numbers. For example: a cooperative has 25 slots for T1 companies. A T2 company would occupy 2 slots, a T3 company 3 slots, and so on, until a T10 company occupies 10 slots, almost half of the entire cooperative.



Forming a cooperative would require strategy both because of its limited slots and the production chains that would be linked... It wouldn't make sense to join an oil-producing company in a farmers' cooperative. This is an extreme example, but it serves to narrow down the concept and show how the strategic factor and interaction between players would be important. For example, even if it is a farmers' cooperative, if most of them produce hay and coffee (which require mills), producers of apples, oranges, and grapes would not contribute much.



Going back a few paragraphs, how does this guarantee that there would be no interference with contracts negotiated through Sales Chat? Because there would still be some competition within the cooperative's own exchange. Ten farmers could produce grain, and they would be competing with each other by offering the best prices within the cooperative's exchange. Eventually, the supply from these players could become stuck in the cooperative's exchange, leading them to the game's universal exchange and the Sales Chat to negotiate contracts. Maintaining a balance between supply and demand within the cooperative would require a much higher level of interaction between players and collaborative work undertaken by them.



This is just an initial draft of an idea that could bring more fun and complexity to the game, as well as boost small and medium-sized businesses.

""Me?  I match.  I mean, it's a black shirt and blue jeans.  I think those colors go well together.""  You say they do.

""What?  What are you giving me that look for?""  You respond with nothing; and that's all I need to know that I'm in the wrong.

1oyscsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/LectureLab/comments/1oyscsq/10_tips_on_notetaking_during_lectures/,10 Tips on note-taking during lectures,"Being a grad student is a lot of work with endless lectures, readings, essays, reports and presentations. But if you think studying is stressful, try ignorance! For those of us curious about “*knowing the causes of things,”* in line with the LSE motto, ignorance is not an option.

So, we are impelled to soak in as much knowledge as possible, grabbing as much as we can the torrent of information thrown at us. Here are some handy tips on pinning down the crucial points during lectures.

**1.      You can’t write down every word**

A lecture is not a dictation exercise where you have to write down everything the professor says. You need to watch out for key points, arguments and themes in the lectures. It's a good thing that lectures are recorded at LSE, so you can always go back and check if you missed a point.

**2.      Pay Attention**

It's very easy to start daydreaming during lectures and miss an important point. Try to rest adequately before lectures so you don't doze off in class. Some take coffee before lectures to keep them alert, others chew gum. Listen attentively to examples given by the professor to explain a point. Sometimes the example helps us remember the point in future.

**3.      Underline, Highlight and Capitalise**

Lecturers often stress or draw attention to certain words or phrases. It is important to underline/highlight these words on your notepad to show how important they are. It might also be useful to start using these terms in your group discussions in order to get familiar with them. 

**4.      Use Shorthand (Abbreviations)**

In order to catch up, some words need to be written in short but in understandable forms. So, take some time to work out whatever shorthand code you're comfortable with. For example words like using ‘2' instead of ‘to', ‘too' and ‘two', or ‘da' for ‘the'; ‘w/' for ‘with', btw for ‘between’, etc. 

**5.      Put distractions away**

It might be a good idea to turn off your Wifi during lectures to avoid receiving distracting messages on WhatsApp or Facebook. Don't forget to put your mobile phone on silent mode, and don't use headphones or earpieces!

**6.      Be Comfortable**

Ensure that you are punctual to your lectures and choose a convenient spot to sit. Students are often put off when their favourite corner of the lecture hall has already been taken. Choose a spot that makes you comfortable and feel part of the lecture. For me, I prefer the second or third row. I often find it difficult to concentrate at the backseats. They remind me of those noisy backbenchers in high school who chuckled and contrived pranks to be used on teachers and fellow students!

**7.      Ask questions when confused**

Don't just write down things you do not understand. Ask for clarification when you are confused. If you're not satisfied, you can always meet the lecturer for further clarification during breaks, after the lecture or during Office Hours.

**8.      Share and compare notes with classmates**

Two heads according to the popular adage are better than one. It is good to find time to compare notes with your classmates and use theirs to update yours and vice versa. They might have picked up some important points that you didn’t.

**9.      Notepad versus Laptop**

There has been a heated debate on which of these two is most effective for note-taking during lectures. Some argue that notepads are old-fashioned and others contend that laptops are distracting. For me, it depends on the individual. I started with notepads and “migrated” to my laptop. It depends on which you find more effective. However, I still use my notepad in some lectures. The point here is to use what works for you.

**10.  Air your opinion**

Lectures are not always one-sided. There are times lecturers throw questions to students or ask for reactions. Don’t be left out. Discuss how the subject matter relates to what you have heard or seen before and your personal opinion about it. The seminars and classes also give more room for personal reflection on the subject matter. They facilitate critical analysis and thrash matters arising from the lecture. Here you can even critique the lecture and offer you own argument. “A lecture”, as George Wald rightly points out, “is much more of a dialogue than many of you probably realise”.",1,1763315896.0,LectureLab,0,1.0,False

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Beneath the Surface**

Jonas stopped keeping track of time. There were no more bells, no more buses. The days measured themselves by the warmth of the ground, the sound of Caleb humming in another room, the scent of something new just before the wind changed. He’d started leaving a story behind. Not for school and not necessarily for Marla, but for whoever came next, whoever was trying to understand.

Each chapter was short, maybe just a paragraph, sometimes just a phrase. They were scribbled in a half-full notebook or scratched onto tree bark or drawn in spirals on the back of grocery receipts. One of the pages just said: “Stillness is not empty,” and another said, “We didn’t disappear. We just went sideways.”

Caleb didn’t talk, but he told stories with scent. He’d built a room of it in the woods behind their house. At first, Jonas thought it was just odd clutter in the woods, but once he’d read Marla’s notes and followed the cinnamon trails she left and understood what the petals meant, then it all came into focus.

There were leaves that smelled like missing someone and stones that carried the memory of his mother’s laugh. He placed there a woven nest of moss and twine that smelled like hope and apple juice and that day Jonas had gotten a B+ and Leland had said “that’s my boy.”  Jonas stood in the center of it and wept, not because he was sad, but because it was the first time in months that he had remembered what it felt like to be held.

One day, Jonas  left a note in the woods. It simply said: “You can come in. If you want. There’s room.” He didn’t know who it was for. Maybe a hiker or a neighbor, a reader or a Resister but the wind carried it and someone would find it.

Jonas never finished the story. He left it open and walked the trails of the woods with a bottle of water, a pencil, and whatever Caleb tucked into his coat pocket. They wandered farther and farther from home, until once, when it was closer to keep going than go back, and so they didn’t.  Every step he took was barefoot, careful, steady and he felt the hum beneath the world, the stillness, the pulse, the not-empty.

And he smiled.



The End

**Epilogue: Boiled Eggs and Boiling Points**



They still called it the Metro Center, though, since the Quiet of MIMs it had changed. Many of the Attuned were still here and a few Basics, but so many had wandered away. To the countryside, Trina supposed. Trina had never lived anywhere but the City, so ‘countryside’ was a nebulous image in her head, with grass and maybe a cow. 

 The billboards in the Metro Center no longer flashed advertisements, and many of them had burned out. One that still worked flashed a fresh abstract mosaic every day. Trina found herself looking forward to seeing it change each morning. She was meeting her friend for coffee and pastry. Well, not coffee, she reminder herself. Now it was tea and boiled eggs, but ‘meeting for coffee’ was still a comfortable phrase from the days before and they stayed in her vocabulary. The other Resistors new what she meant.  The old coffee shops were gone now, but an old woman had set up a tent on the wide sidewalk that at one time had been so full of people it was hard to see your own feet during the busy times. 

Trina emerged from the station with the smell of brake‑dust on her sleeves. She had been an engineer before the Quiet. Still was, she thought defiantly, though the workbench now held scavenged copper wire, Attuned silk for insulators, and a wrench wrapped in oil‑cloth so the metal wouldn’t ring. The boots on her feet were heavy enough to remember asphalt fires and blackout drills, and yet she walked with almost no sound.

At the plaza’s edge a small kiosk leaned against the marble flank of a defunct bank. A hand‑painted sign read: TEA • HERBS • CURIOUS CURRENCY. The sign was for the benefit of Resistors, because the Attuned never needed words to find the place. Inside sat the woman people called the Tea Witch of Central Park, an Elder hovering somewhere between Attuned and Basic. Age tugged most Elders down toward Basic, but this one drifted there like a bubble on slow water.

No one knew the witch’s real name, they only knew she foraged plants and flowers from the green spaces, leaves from the decorative trees that had been planted Before and the weeds that burst through the park’s cracked pathways, and she brewed them with boiling water. She never gave you the tea that you asked for, but instead looked at you, sniffed you, and gave you the tea she thought you deserved. There was also a basket of hard boiled eggs to choose from, if you were hungry. Trina had no idea where the eggs came from. She had never seen a chicken in her life. 

The Tea Witch didn’t look up when Trina approached, but she inhaled. “Thyme and graphite,” she decided, scooping brittle leaves into a dented tin cup. “For knees that grind and thoughts that outrun sleep.” The steam rose smelling of pencil shavings in minestrone. Trina paid with a ritual. She pressed a scrap of paper to each of her cheeks, capturing the salt‑and‑iron scent of a sleepless night, tore it into thin strips, and laid them on the counter. Human trace was good tender in these parts.

Jules coasted up on a rattling bicycle too small for their long frame. Once Jules had overseen municipal logistics for twelve districts, back when radios were plentiful and passwords were important. Now they coordinated by foot and rumor, brandishing a map repaired with candle drippings and hope. Their hair, once clipped neat for meetings, hung in loose coils, smelling faintly of camphor.

The Witch gave Jules a mug steeped in fennel, yarrow, and a whisper of burnt rosemary. “Digestive and revelation,” she said, and Jules, already bracing for the taste, nodded a weary thanks. They left a stone payment, smooth river granite with a crack shaped like a question mark that they had found amongst the decorative rocks outside an abandoned fast food place. Jules then followed Trina to the only bench left intact.

Beyond the tent, a Basic shuffled past. Like many Basics, he was barefoot, and hummed three soft notes. He paused beside a pillar blasted by decades of exhaust, laid his palm on the stone, and smiled as though the concrete had told a joke. Dust clung to his fingertips but he never noticed, and soon he wandered on in peaceful reverie.

Trina exhaled, watching him. “I’m glad they’re alive,” she said, voice low. “But if I could get one to read a pressure gauge, I’d cry from gratitude.”

Jules snorted around a sip of scalding tea. “My inventory database overwrote itself with free verse about root vegetables. Beautiful but useless.”

“Three S‑17 transformers blew yesterday,” Trina continued. “I used to order replacements with one click but now I barter for copper scrap and prayer.”

“Water pumps in District Three died at dawn,” Jules countered. “The Attuned there say the river will provide when it’s ready. The river is not ready.”

They fell quiet. Above them, a drone, once a courier for same‑day luxuries, whirred across the skyline and stalled. Its rotors slowed, then lifted again in a lazy spiral, like a lost dragonfly.

Trina set her cup on the bench slat, rubbed thumb to forefinger, feeling the dents of the tin cup. “We need help.”

“Help doesn’t want to clock in,” Jules answered.

Trina angled her body, boots planted. “Then we change the job description.”

From a messenger tube strapped to the bike, Jules pulled a dog‑eared map patched with scraps of vellum and transit brochure. District borders had been redrawn in wax pencil; small lavender circles marked Attuned neighborhoods, sage dots marked Basic sanctuaries, and gray X’s labeled critical infrastructure still run by Resistors. They tapped an empty warehouse three blocks south. “Used to be city archives. It has a solid roof and the windows are intact. What if we bring meaning to them?”

Trina raised an eyebrow. “Meaning?”

“Label it a shrine.” Jules’s finger traced the lines of the map. “Tell the Attuned to come to the empty warehouse to learn of the secret things that need attention. We prioritize the things that need fixing, and present one problem, er, “secret thing” and let them try their hands at it. Who know how their brains work now, but surely some of them had practical training Before. And if not, the Attuned can do weird things and we let them fix it in their own way. First, the water tower is a shrine that needs blessing. Let them repaint the pipes with river clay, sing to the valves, and so on. Basics can paint wayfinding sigils in flower oil. Whatever they want as long as it keeps working. We reframe maintenance as ritual. Systems get serviced and they feel needed. They *are* needed.”

Trina’s skepticism flickered into a grin. “So my filtration array becomes sacred plumbing.”

“Isn’t clean water holy?” Jules asked.

Wind scraped through a row of broken windows. Homemade wind chimes answered by the clacking of plastic spoons, brass keys, broken phone screens. A courier paused and a child traced chalk spirals with bare toes. Trina breathed in thyme, graphite, and faint hope.

She lifted her tin cup and Jules met it with theirs. The thin rims clinked.

“Boiled eggs and boiling points,” Trina muttered.

“At least the tea’s still good,” Jules replied. The mischievous grin followed.

They stood as sunlight caught the shattered glass of the old insurance tower and scattered gold across the plaza. For an instant, the ruins looked deliberate, as. if they were designed.

Trina hefted her wrench. “Let’s go make a shrine.”

Jules swung onto their bike. “Ritual by lunchtime.”



**Week One: The Pitch**

Jules rode their bike to the warehouse at dawn, stopping at a corner store along the way. The doors were open. There were no clerks,  and no prices, just shelves full of whatever had been left behind. You took what you needed, and if you had something to leave, you did.

They chose a tube of toothpaste.

At the warehouse, Jules uncapped the tube and dabbed it onto doorframes and window sills, the sharp, clean mint layered over rust and mildew. The scent would carry and the Attuned would notice.

Back on their bike, they pedaled the looping streets until they spotted a woman resting against a bench, eyes closed, bare feet pressed to the warm concrete. Attuned, unmistakably. Jules coasted to a stop.

“There are secret things that need attention,” they said softly. “Someone will speak for them at sunrise. At the warehouse that smells like mint.”

They didn’t wait for an answer because the Attuned didn’t need one. Word would spread. And it did.

At sunrise, six arrived. Two were Attuned artists. One had berry-dyed palms, the other wore copper wire twisted into a loose crown. A thin, stooped man who’d once been a city planner followed close behind, his fingers twitching as if still sketching blueprints in the air.

A Basic man came next, barefoot and quiet, pausing every few steps to brush the sidewalk with the backs of his hands. With him, a silent and patient child who placed pebbles in delicate spirals along the curb while they waited.

Last was Sorrel, who had once been called Jenna. Now she wore a tool belt stitched with petals and a wrench tucked into her braid like a hair ornament.

They didn’t ask who Jules was, they just asked what the object needed.

Jules led them to a corroded floodgate valve buried half in ivy and rotting leaves. Water hissed from its joint.

“It wants to turn,” Jules said. “It wants to hold water, not lose it.”

No one laughed. Sorrel stepped forward, knelt, and pressed her forehead to the metal. She hummed a low, resonant note that seemed to thrum through the concrete. The Basic man drew a vine from his satchel and tied it around the valve, the knot loose but careful. The child arranged copper washers in a ring at the base, like tiny sun dials. Then, together, they turned the valve. It moved slowly and with intention. The hissing of the water turned to drops, then stopped completely. The leak was stopped and the air shifted. Everyone breathed.

“It is done,” Sorrel said.

And from that morning on, people came at sunrise. They were told what needed attention and attention was given. Usually, it worked.



**Week Three: Word Spreads**

Across the plaza, Trina stood with arms crossed, watching.

She didn’t speak, but her eyes tracked everything-- the movement,  the order, the quiet synchronization of hands and hearts.

Jules joined her, sipping yarrow tea from the Witch’s dented tin cup.

“You’re telling me,” Trina said, “this is working because we made the valve holy?”

Jules let the question settle before answering. “I’m saying it was always holy. We just had to let them notice.”

The next morning, a cluster of Attuned began repainting the faded crosswalks. Not with white paint, but with fermented berry dye, infused with crushed lavender stems. The scent clung to soles and gave a scent trail to those who passed.

That same week, a pharmacy opened in the shell of a laundromat. People brought medications found in abandoned buildings. A lightly Attuned former pharmacist worked beside an Elder herbalist, treating coughs, fevers, and the occasional unnameable ache.

And on the Resistor bulletin, someone posted a handwritten poem:

We carried what we thought was waste,  
But now becomes the seed.

It was unsigned, but in the margin, there was a meticulously drawn blueprint for a compost facility that ran without power, using rainwater, rotation, and worms.



**Week Four: Resistance and Reminders**

The Resistors accepted the invitation grudgingly.  They came mid-morning, a small delegation in worn boots and patched coats, the kind of people who still checked voltage by hand and measured time in service logs. They approached the plaza with guarded expressions, their breath visible in the spring-chilled air. A few carried clipboards. One wore a tool belt with the authority of someone who had once managed twelve maintenance crews and still thought in schematics.

Jules waited for them beside the Shrine of the Turning Valve, a name spoken first as a joke, then repeated often enough to take root. The valve itself sat beneath a weatherproof tarp of stitched-together plastic and linen, but the space around it had changed. Chalk sigils marked the paving stones in faded ochre and mint. Bundles of herbs were tucked into the seams of the access hatch. A small plaque made of candle wax and copper shavings gleamed in the filtered sun.

Trina stood to the side, arms folded. Her posture said was no-nonsense and said that this is important, we should take it seriously. 

The Resistors fanned out cautiously.

“We need infrastructure,” one of them said, before Jules could speak. “Not improv theater. We need reliability. You know that.”

“I do,” Jules said, voice even. They stepped closer, gently pulling aside the tarp. “And so does the system.”

The plaque came into view,  etched with copper shavings and wax, held in place with braided wire.

**This place remembers being needed.**  
**Thank it, and it may serve again.**

There was a moment no longer than a breath when no one spoke.

Then Jules gestured toward the valve. “It was leaking. We tried torque. We tried replacement parts. Nothing held. Not until they...” they tilted their head toward the watching Attuned, just out of view, “...asked what it needed. Not how to fix it. What it needed.”

“And you think it needed a blessing?” the older man with the limp asked, his voice tinged with ridicule, but softer than it might’ve been.

“I think it needed to be seen,” Jules said.

Silence again. Then a sharp hiss, a short exhale of pressure, as the valve released a single, deliberate breath. Then it held.

Long moments of silence followed while the Resistors balanced the Before and After and tried to settle the New into their thinking. Jules waited. 

One of the delegation stepped forward, slowly, as if unsure what moved his feet. It was the older man. He looked down at the copper plaque, read it again. Then, without speaking, he reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a hard-boiled egg, wrapped in wax paper and placed it beside the valve like a long-overdue apology. No one mocked him. One of the women from the delegation whispered, “Maybe the system just needed someone to care.”

Jules didn’t smile, not quite, but they nodded, once. “That’s all we’re asking.”

Trina unfolded her arms. There had been no verbal battle, just a sigh and  and acceptance of something new. It wasn’t a revolution, but it was still a shift and for some reason the world was shifting with it.



**And Onward**

What began as a plan soon became a pattern. It wasn’t a program or a policy, it was a rhythm. Fixing things became an act of listening, of letting objects reveal what they missed, what they wanted to be again. Maintenance became memory work, woven from scent and sound and presence. Some valves were tuned like bells. Some wires hummed when realigned by steady, reverent hands.

Even the Resistors, trained in scarcity and schedules, began to bend, just a little, to the new shape of effort. Trina started carrying copper shavings in her coat pocket. She didn’t know what for specifically, but just in case something needed remembering. Jules hummed while they worked, low and tuneless, like a grounding wire for the soul.

And when the new water tower finally stood fastened together from repurposed steel, wrapped reverently in vines, painted in scent, and crowned with a sun-sigil made from bent spoons and mirror shards, no one posted signage or claimed credit, but the people just came.

They came to refill canteens, to sit in the shade, to rest a hand on its warm belly and feel it hum softly back.

They called it, “The place that doesn’t leak anymore. The place that fills the empty pot.”",1,1763315364.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/GQRouZDZ8r)  **July 18, 2014**

Brief backstory: I met her mom once at a wedding and it didn't go as planned.  It wasn't awful and i didn't make an ass out of myself or anything like that, i just didn't have a conversation with her as much as she would've like, i guess.  I was just so distracted by friends, and the usual wedding antics.  This is the one and only time we've met in person.  I've met the dad a few times, and we're cool.

That was a year ago; since then, she's always had a slight distaste for me.  She doesn't hate me, but she never gave me another chance.  I recently found out she argues with my girlfriend very passionately about how i'm not the right one, and how my gf should date other people.  These arguments have been happening everytime they come to town or my gf visits them (at least once or twice a month), and apparently it got really intense last week.

My gf says her mom had a nervous breakdown halfway through the argument while my gf was defending me and giving her the reasons why she likes me.  She's extremely stubborn, and i think that's being generous.  She does this to my gf's dad too, always mentioning how she could've had another life without him, wishes she dated more, etc.  Btw, they married in their late 30's.

So now, there's this guy, don't know his name or who he is.  My gf's mom knows him through one of her friends, her son.  She keeps asking my gf to go on a date with him, and gets more adamant about it every time my gf mentions me.  Lo and behold, my gf buckled and accepted the date.  She says it's the best solution to the problem, that maybe if she just goes on 1 date and explains to her mom why she didn't like him, then it'll thaw the situation.  The date is being set up as we speak.

I'm torn; of course i didn't agree with it.  I asked what my gf would think if i were to do that, and she said it would hurt her a lot.  I know it's only 1 date, but i can't stand the thought of another guy trying to put the charm on my gf.  Also, if i give up my self-respect by giving in, her mom will walk all over me every time.  I thought of every alternative under the sun, even told my gf to mention to the guy that she's already dating someone.  I got furious when she told me she wouldn't ""ruin the date"" by saying that.  As much as i tried to think of an alternative, i got shot down, and it made me think that maybe my gf's mom finally got inside her head and now she does want to date other people.  She even said ""well, if the date happens soon, i can't say no"", after i asked her to buy us some time by putting off the date until we figure out a rational solution.


She did have one good idea though -- to write her mom a letter, letting her know that i'm aware of the situation and that i would love to meet her one day.  Just a simple and nice letter, explaining why we've come this far and how much the situation means to me.  I already did, and i'm planning to send it out once we proof-read it together.  However, i feel like the situation has already wore us down to the point that we both feel like we're on different wave lengths all the time.  The part that hurts about it the most, is that we had a perfect relationship with each other, and we never did anything to hurt one another, until this got in the way and made things awkward between us.

I'm not sure what to do or how to approach it.  It's depressing my gf, and trying to buy time has taken a mental toll on both of us.  I don't want her to go on the date at all; i would never forgive myself for letting it happen without trying my own approach first.

**TL;DR:** my gf's mom has an irrational distaste for our relationship and is already setting her up on a date with someone else.  I hate that idea, but my gf doesn't seem to think it's too bad.

Here the problem is that this mom knows how to get what she wants by being a huge bitch. Shut that down or leave this woman. This is a good time for an actual ultimatum, for a change.

**OOP**

>>I've come to the realization that the letter will do me no good, after reading the responses in this thread.  I would like to play a small role in helping my gf with this since she has a ton of other fires to put out unrelated to this issue.  When i say small role, i mean offering her my side of things while we work towards a mutually beneficial situation, and not actually addressing her mother directly about this issue.

**OOP**

>>My thoughts exactly.  I told my gf that if her mother wins, she'll exploit our passive nature every time and it will eventually lead to the end of our relationship. 

**EDIT:**  Thank you all for the responses, i assure you that i've read each and every one, and i'm trying to respond to them while i'm @ work.  I would also like to add that if my gf does choose to go on the date, she is doing so against her own judgement and plans to keep it as brief as possible.  Still doesn't make it any more appropriate, but just thought it would be fair if i cleared that up.

**EDIT#2:** Her mom doesn't want us to break up, but she just has this insane belief that my gf should keep the relationship open until she decides exactly who she wants to be with.  This is dumb for 2 reason -- #1: my gf has dated quite a bit and knows what she wants, #2 -- we've been getting along incredibly well for the past 2 years and for some reason her mom is convincing herself that it's not genuine.  Possible underlying issues.

**EDIT #3:** Thank you all for continuing the discussion with me.  I have a pretty clear picture of what i should do now when she gets back into town.  I will post an update after we have a conversation about it.  In the meantime, I ask you all to believe in the ones you love.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/Db2vtaHrAQ)  **July 24, 2014 (6 days later)**

So I had a talk with my gf last night, told her to basically put her foot down now or we'll have to suffer her mother's toxicity for the rest of our lives.  She said there was no way she could do that to her mother, we argued about it for 2 hours.  I told her that she needs to grow a backbone because if not with me, her mother will control every other aspect of her life and continually cause unwanted misery towards her and everyone she decides to date.

Then, it came out that the date I mentioned in the post has been set up, and she's agreed to see him.  I blew my lid and told her that disrespects me, our relationship, and herself.  She even admitted that her mother has in fact manipulated her to believing that having an open relationship is a great idea. 

I lost all respect and trust for her, and there's no way to earn it back.  She said she would compromise by going on 1 coffee date with this guy, just once, and we'll take a break for a month.  For the sake of leaving things amicably, i ""agreed"" to the compromise, but I told her once I walk out, the chances of her seeing me again are slim to none.  She cried about that, and for once, I didn't feel sympathy for her.  I comforted her while she was crying, but my mind was already checked out.

I'm curious what the next month will bring; she said she would still like to keep in contact with me in some way, but i'm not intent on contacting her anytime soon.  I'm just pissed that i left some books there that I was currently in the middle of reading.  Maybe i'll just shoot her a text a couple months to pick up my books.

What hurts the most, is that we had such a great relationship together.  We got along well, our arguments were few and very far in between, and usually ended on a good note.  It was a perfect relationship, but an external force caused the downfall.  It hurts because i had no control, and i basically had to give up an incredible relationship for the sake of pleasing someone that only matters to a certain extent.  I just feel so defeated, and i never had a chance to defend myself or fight back.  If we hated each other, i would understand, but we didn't.  This breakup will suck for a while, i'll admit that; i've never been in a relationship like this before.  It was so great, then it became a train wreck, literally overnight.

**EDIT:** Wow, thanks for all the supportive comments!  I just want to make one thing clear: I haven't actually agreed to the compromise, I'm just a nice person at heart and didn't want to storm out of there with a big ""F*CK YOU"" attached to the story.  Please remember that we had some great times and I still think she's a kind person (maybe not towards me or herself, but we're all human after all).  I only halfheartedly accepted the compromise so we could have an amicable split; of course I won't take her back after a month or follow through with the compromise.



---

> You're not the only one. Seriously, your ex is pathetic and you are doing the right thing by removing yourself from this situation, since she has no desire to do anything but what her mother tells her to. 

**OOP**

>>Funny, she admitted to losing her self-respect as well.

**Upallnight88**

> Most of the posters are flaming your ex because she chose her mother over you (and her future).  It's sad that she has such devotion to her mother that she lets her screw up her life but some children have a tough time cutting the apron strings.  I'm sure that one day soon your ex will wake up and realize that she's let her mother fuck up a perfect relationship.  In the movies girls like her end up marring losers, having 10 kids and forever thinking about the one that got away.

> Edit: I've never wanted an update more

**OOP**

>>I told her this, not in those exact words, but I did tell her that her mother will make her miserable for the rest of her life, and this situation will bite her in the ass when she least expects it.

**theskipster**

>Call her up and ask to get your books. Then when you are there get your books and tell her there is no month break because it is fully over. 

**OOP**

>>Meh, can't be bothered by it at the moment.  She said she would call me throughout this month to check up on things, so when if I feel like getting my books back, i'll just ask her to mail them to me (we live 6 miles apart).

**drzoidburger**

> I'm a girl with manipulative parents, and my mom in particular hated for my ex for what she perceived as a ""lack of ambition"" in him. She was always putting him down behind his back and telling me I was too good for him. Did I ever agree to go out with someone else because of her manipulations? Fuck no. Your girlfriend is using her mother as an excuse. Unless she has the brain of a four-year-old, there is no way her mother manipulated her into believing an open relationship was okay. She *wants* to date someone who isn't you, and she's only *saying* that it's because of her mother. 
>
> All this talk of a month-long break is her way to test the waters with this new guy while keeping you around as a backup plan. Fuck that. Go no-contact with her, get a friend to go pick up the books for you, and cut this girl out of your life. 
      
**OOP**

>>Her argument against standing up to her mother was that she's an only child and comes from a traditional family.  I called it an excuse and wasn't having any of that.  It just proves she's just too far gone into her mother's manipulation.

Hey there,

Earnestly I don’t really know what I’m looking for on here, right now I’m hoping to find someone who would like to meet up and grab a drink or a coffee. 

After that I’m open to suggestions haha. 

I’m a bit of an inexperienced guy, never really dated and the idea posting here is to talk and get to know someone who is okay being a bit more understanding that I’m a bit new to all this. Open to making friends, long term fun or just something else you may have in mind.

I’d rather ease into things and get to know someone first. 

I can send a pic if you’re interested but description wise I’m 5 10, short brown hair, medium build. I like to read, go to the movies, started working out recently, and i like going for walks around the city. I’m a sociable, funny guy (I think lol) happy to chat and see if we’re a good match!

An odder type of post on here but if you’re interested let me know!

""Mmmmmmmggggghhhh…""

The drowsy woman sat up slowly, stretching to ease the knots and tension built up within. A low yawn escaped her lips as she did so. She must've been more tired than she thought.

Well, she DID spend a bit longer working than usual last night. Just to keep acclimating herself to a laboratory environment. It was amazing how fast the time flew by.

*""You sure you're okay to keep working? It's okay to take a break. This must all be n- well, maybe not quite 'new', but-""*

Especially with...such helpful, pleasant and personable company.

She could already feel her cheeks heating up, and she opened her eyes just to confirm.

She still couldn't recognise the woman she saw in the mirror. That billowing white lab coat, the black sweater, the green skirt, those dark grey tights...it didn't look quite right. But it didn't look wholly wrong either, with some part of her brain flashing up hazy memories and arguing that it felt right to dress this way. She probably just needed some time.

*Abe.*

The name rolled around her mouth, bounced off her tongue awkwardly. It didn't feel like hers. Didn't feel like a name she could wear with pride. Not this patched husk.

Abe dressed like this. Abe had created all of those walking miracles and beacons of hope. Abe had helped do the impossible and sever the Queen's station from Earth. Not Grave.

But Cinderella and Mermaid had been insistent that that was still her. That Grave and Abe were just as beautiful as each other, that she could get all of that old beauty back and combine it with the new to be even more dazzling. She'd not had the heart to turn them down.

And, thankfully, they'd not been the only ones.

Tours around the finest of The Ark's labs and workshops, calling in old favours he was owed, letting her see that Eden place and getting treatments with that Cecil woman (she still hadn't told Grave what those syringes contained)...even taking her to old UFH ruins to see if any of it would help. How he found those places she didn't know, just said he knew some friends with good eyes for old relics.

He really was a Superhuman, wasn't he? Putting all this effort into putting 'Abe' back together.

A knock at the door shook her.

""Ab- ah, Grave? Are you awake?""

It was him.

""Just a moment, Superhuman.""

She reached over to her dresser and put on the set of glasses that lay there. Then, she snatched up the scrunchie and tied her hair back into a scruffy ponytail. She took one more look at herself in the mirror.

That felt better. More familiar. More right.

With that, she headed on over to the door and thumbed the release. As soon as his softly smiling visage appeared, she started to rebuke her own body for the rise in temperature, hoping he wouldn't notice.

Fortunately, he didn't, instead asking ""Ready to go?""

""Y-Yes, ready. What are we doing today?""

Now it was Superhuman's turn to blush lightly, which didn't make Grave feel any less embarrassed herself, rubbing at his neck.

""I was thinking that maybe we should go and get some coffee and cake together.""

Grave's core pulsed quite sharply at that, with her needing to swallow and praying he didn't notice her cheeks getting even redder.

*I-Is thi- this is a date, isn't it?*

""Is there...any reason why?"" She asked, softly. ""Is coffee useful for some form of mental rehabilitation?""

""Oh, it was Cinderella's idea, actually."" Superhuman said.

Warring pangs of disappointment, that it wasn't his idea, and embarrassment, that it was instead Cinderella's scheme, bubbled up in Grave's mind. She pinched her thigh to dispel them and refocused on Superhuman, since he was speaking again.

""She said that you told her you used to go out for coffee when you'd get stalled on work all the time, mostly with lab colleagues. I know you don't have any colleagues like that today, so...I thought I'd sub in."" He said, grinning in that endearingly awkward manner that got another pulse from her core.

Grave searched all of Abe- all of her memories that she'd currently recalled, no matter how hazy or fleeting, trying to find even one where she'd ever gone out like that to blow of steam.

There were none, just memory after memory of shuffling on down to the vending machine or cafeteria section to buy some of the largest coffees and chocolates or cakes on sale before locking herself in her lab to work herself past exhaustion trying to solve the problem before her.

By all accounts, that wouldn't help her remember Abe very much.

And yet...

""Y-Yes, then let's do that."" Grave found herself saying, even as her traitorous body heated up further. ""Did you have anywhere in mind, Superhuman?""

""A few places, actually. It'll be a bit of a walk, but how about we take a look at all of them and see which menu you like best?""

He held out his hand. After a fortifying breath and shaky hand, Grave took it in her own. Her return smile was far easier than she expected.

""Then, please lead the way, Superhuman.""

The two walked off, hand in hand, unaware of the prying eyes observing them from atop a shield and stack of bubbles.

""See! I told you it would work!""

""You're right. Fufu, Abe looks so happy.""

""Of course she is, she's with Prince. He'll definitely treat her like his Princess...he always does that.""

""Then, that's our mission accomplished.""

""Unless-""

""But we can't spy on them like that, Cindy. It's rude!""

""...you don't want to see how cute and beautiful Abe will look when she's flustered?""

""Well, maybe for a few minutes, okay?""

""Fufufu, okay then.""",4,1763315177.0,PeakKitchenOutpost,4,1.0,False

And how to filter video content to give yourself peace.,"Call me racist, I don’t give a shit. Due to the on-slew of white supremacy content on YouTube (This includes ads), I’m disengaging, I’m not even missing much cus now I get shitty AI videos on my feed constantly too. If y’all want to get rid of allat junk, I’ll tell y’all but before I do, what are some black youtubers that y’all enjoy watching? I like Courtreezy, Deb Smikle, Foreign Man In a Foreign Land and Antonio Speaks to name a few, this is how I want my home page to look for peace of mind. 

If y’all want the same, y’all gon have to do techy stuff but it’s worth it, if you’re on iOS — You can download Yattee (It’s on the App Store) and NewPipe or Clipious on Android. (These aren’t on Play Store but you can download with a third party App Store called F-Droid. It’s safe as I have used all of what I mentioned myself.) There, y’all can import your subscriptions from YouTube and enjoy it without the ick. (Like shorts, ads and some custom clients give you the choice to disable comments.)

For Yattee, you’d need to either use two platforms called Invidious and Piped, that act as a front end for YouTube. (They grab content from YouTube without you actually having to use the official YouTube clients.)

Perditum is a working server on Invidious

https://inv.perditum.com/feed/popular

You’d go here and tap on create account if you find it, make sure to save your username and password as this service does not include email registrations for what I assume to be safety measures.

If you want to use Piped, do the same. This [Private.Coffee] is the only working server on Piped.

https://piped.private.coffee/trending

EDIT: I forgot to mention that if y’all want to use Yattee, then after y’all create accounts for either Piped or Invidious, y’all would enter y’all account info here:

https://imgur.com/a/nzKYpXo

What are these? If I had to explain these services (Piped & Invidious), they’re basically YouTube but if we coded / programmed the platform from our own homes. Apps like Yattee and NewPipe are apps made to make these services accessible to us like how there are mobile apps for Reddit.

I hope it’s okay that I post this here even though my question isn’t directly related to the main focus of this community but I’m currently in the middle of rebranding my family’s small ice cream shop — its something we're deeply proud of.

The shop is on the verge of closing due to a significant rent increase from my landlord. We can no longer sustain the shop the way it currently is, so I’ve decided to fight for it by expanding what we offer. My goal is to transform the ice cream shop into a space that also serves pastries and coffee so we can attract more customers, increase revenue, and hopefully save the business.

But here’s where I need help. I know this community isn’t centered around pastries or coffee, so I’m hoping someone might be able to point me in the right direction. Are there any subreddits, forums, or online communities that focus on: 

1. Coffee drinks, espresso basics, café management, or recipe development

2. General guidance for people adding pastries or coffee to an existing food business

3. Pastry recipes or bakery operations.

4. To know if anyone has tried anything like this before and if so how was your experience ?

Any recommendations or redirects would mean a lot.

For anyone interested in supporting the effort to save the shop, I also started a GoFundMe to help cover renovation and equipment costs. I’ll leave the link below — and of course its absolutely no pressure, but every share or bit of support truly helps.

**GoFundMe link:** [https://gofund.me/48db45bd8](https://gofund.me/48db45bd8)

1oyrwxk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oyrwxk,Oh the weather outside is frightful,"Actually the weather is really nice today, just a bit windy. This is a review of a MCW Menu 9, rice and chicken, Mexican. I ate most of it last night and had the strawberry shake for breakfast along with the coffee from the LRP. This ration contained the main, a strawberry shake, smoked almonds, cranberries, shortbreads cookies and the accessory pack which contained coffee, creamer, sugar, Tabasco, gum, matches, TP and moist towelettes. I'll start with breakfast. 

I was shocked that the taster's choice red wasn't skunked. I made it with the creamer and sugar which were also still fine. This is definitely not the best US MRE coffee. It's probably the worst one out of all of them. It doesn't mean that it's terrible, it's just the worst in a bunch of good coffee. I'd love to get a couple of packs of each type of MRE coffee through the years to try against each other to rank them. Try them plain, then with the creamer and sugar. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge. I'd give it a 6/10. Not the best but does the job. 

The strawberry shake is a thing. I made it with milk so it would be more like a milkshake and this stuff just wouldn't mix. It had a thick head that had clumps of powder and and globules of the cream. I'm thinking a frother would be good to mix these. The flavor is fine and the milk does make it taste better. The chocolate is way better though. I'd give it a 6/10. Mainly because of how hard it was to mix it.

The shortbread cookies were a simple vanilla cookie that were pleasantly sweet and lightly flavored with a crumbly texture. 7/10 for these. The cranberries are cranberries. A nice sweet and tart snack to have with cookies. 7/10 for these too. The smoked almonds were a bit disappointing because they didn't really have a strong smoke flavor. These are usually strongly flavored and you don't get a huge portion. They mixed well with the cranberries too and I mixed all three for a trail mix that was surprisingly delicious. I give the almonds a 6/10. 

The main was a Mexican rice and chicken. I ended up putting a bit more water than required because it wasn't fully hydrated with the 16 ozs. Probably more like 20-22 ozs. The most disappointing part of the whole MRE was the Tabasco. It was brown in the bottle so I put a bit on the spoon to give it a sniff and taste and stopped at the sniff. Good Lord it was funky. It went in the trash and the spoon went into the sink. I opted for several dabs of Crystal. Basically it tasted like a taco rice with some nice chicken chunks and pieces of tomatoes. Before the hot sauce I'd say this was a 7.5/10. It was seasoned decently well but was missing something. The hot sauce provides. This brought up to and 8.5/10. 

Overall this is a solid menu. It's not the best but still great. I give it a 7.5/10 for the whole MRE. If you don't want to purchase the MCWs, you can always get the mains from mountain house and they're on sale for black Friday right now. Stay safe and be kind. ",2,1763314872.0,MRE,1,1.0,False

1oyrtm1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oyrtm1,"Cornelius Coffey admitted to and died at Broughton Hospital, NC","Cornelius Coffee (1844-1906) was born in rural Appalachia, into a large family with many siblings. I lived throughout the Civil War, but it’s unknown if he ever served on either the side of the Confederacy or Union. (Much of this area of western North Carolina was split Union/Confederate, leaning Union. A few of Cornelius’ brothers were listed as Confederate.) I found on the census that he, and the rest of his family, were all farmers, which was very common in this Appalachian region. 

I feel like Cornelius’ story is best told from his Find A Grave, so I’ll quote it: 

- “At some point, Cornelius Coffey began to show signs of mental illness. According to descendants, Betty was so embarrassed by his behavior that she banished him to a shed where he occupied his time with leatherwork. In 1888 Cornelius' illness became so severe that he was committed to the Western North Carolina Insane Asylum in Morganton, Burke Co., N.C. (Founded five years earlier, the Asylum was later renamed Broughton Hospital.) Cornelius recovered briefly and returned to his family in 1890 only to be committed again a year later, this time permanently. (Unfortunately, at this late date it is not possible to determine the nature of Cornelius's illness. The hospital has destroyed patient records from this period.) Cornelius Coffey lived the last fifteen years of his life at the hospital, dying on June 2, 1906. As the family did not claim his body, he was buried as patient no. 201136 in the hospital cemetery. A small plaque was later added with his name misspelled.”

Link: https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/25288310/cornelius-coffey

I was really impressed with the detail of this specific state hospital’s cemetery. Many people actually had headstones! (Which is a rarity. Many patients were buried in unmarked graves and many individual burials are impossible to track today.)

In regard to Cornelius, I was fascinated that he occupied his time in his leather-shop. And while the stigma is very obvious (his wife banishing him to the woodshed and his re-admission) it does appear the family tried to keep him at home. I also have a feeling that maybe he was prone to wandering, so I figure some level of confusion was apparent. His diagnosis isn’t obviously known. He was 44 when this came about — whether it was gradual or onset, I don’t believe we’d know either. He could’ve had a neurological issue happen or a head injury if it was onset. 

Either way, I do find it very sweet that he had a medium (leatherwork) which probably gave him much peace.

Alcohol is still part of going out and talking to people, but a lot of us seem to be trying to find some sort of middle ground where it doesn't ruin our ability to focus at a time where attention is such a scarce resource..

Lately, it's been on my mind a lot about how we can actually drink without any downsides. Has anyone found anything? I'm curious to know if anyone has found anything that could solve this. 

As a student at UCLA, I have a little bit of experience in biochemistry, and I've actually found that there are ways for us to prevent it through supplements. I don't know if any of you guys have tried home remedies. I've had electrolytes, random vitamins before bed, coffee in the morning. But this article is very interesting that they show that there's actually ways to prevent hangovers through the digestive tract with giving nutrients through the skin.

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction! 

Here’s an icebreaker to help start a conversation / show me if you actually read through the post lol: what is something you are looking forward to / excited about?",1,1763314472.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.67,False
1oyrqkr,https://i.redd.it/7psvv556nn1g1.jpeg,40lbs down update,"What a wild ride it’s been. Celebrated 40lbs gone today, never to be seen again! 

I started my journey in June, and it’s been pretty amazing! Overall I feel lighter, but still struggle in my brain that I’m not as overweight as I was. 

My first non-scale victory was this week when I was sleeping! I’m a side sleeper and my knees now touch when I’m laying on my side and it’s uncomfortable 😂 so now I shove the blanket between my legs for some cushion. That definitely wasn’t even something I thought was a thing! 

I’m currently microdosing on 3.75 from 2.5 and hope to continue my journey here for as long as I can. 

Minimal side effects, most are due to me not being diligent in drinking/eating enough.

1oyrq86,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1oyrq86/where_to_go_from_the_zp6/,Where to go from the ZP6?,"My journey started with a Baratza Forte BG, then to a Q2 I originally bought for travel, then to the ZP6 - yet I still feel I am missing some juicy goodness and I just can't say I'm in love with the ZP6.

Water seems okay at around 70ppm, brewing mostly single V60s with Abaca papers and recently an Orea 01 flat bed. Occasionally an Aeropress.

Not sure if I'm just not a sensitive taster or if I just need to upgrade to something better, but I just don't think I get enough out of my coffees (manly light roasts). So often I just feel like I'm not tasting anything, yet extraction measures at around 20%. So where do you go from the ZP6? Let's say a 700 USD budget. The consensus around here is that I'm looking at a Pietro, a Millab M01, an 078, or even an A4Z. I'm open to them all and others, but really the goal is just to not be wondering if I could be drinking something better if I had a better grinder (within reason - I'd love an EG-1).",1,1763314426.0,pourover,5,0.6,False

1oyrpc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oyrpc8/you_may_flourish_before_you_die/,“You May Flourish Before You Die”,"I remember that his name was strange, quite unlike anything I had ever heard of, especially being from the Northeast. And he didn’t look much like the other students at our college. His clothes were ragged, and seemingly barely put together. But he moved with a slow confidence when he transitioned from one of our classes to the next. He seemed to be happy in his loneliness. Occasionally, I’d see him outside the old brick science building, sitting there as the sun broke through the rolling autumnal clouds, as shadows ran across a very gaunt, fixed face. He rarely seemed to change his face. Now to think of it, he was a lot like some specter, and when I told my friends about that thought, it soon became an inside joke. One pal would say to me, “I saw that ancient ghost again, moving through the hall from the bathroom!” while another asked “How often do ghosts go to the bathroom.” 

I can’t say I felt too happy when I’d see Lazarus. We shared some classes. And he’d just sit there, in a manner that was simply quiet and stoic. Even the professors avoided conversation with him. They just seemed to nod when returning his exams. I decided that one afternoon, I’d go speak to Lazarus. We shared an evening class, and I began to notice that we took the same path back to the dormitory. I caught up with him this one night. A thick fog had lain over the land, for it was mid-November now and winter crept towards our collegiate hamlet. 

“Hey, Lazarus, right?” I began, extending my hand. He nodded politely and replied with my name. The walk back wasn’t too long, and we simply just traded words on our shared class and the professor who taught it. Lazarus’ judgment seemed to not only be fair, but he carried the wisdom of an almost ancient sage. In a simple sentence, he seemed to summarize the world. Upon our entry to the dormitory, he shook my hand again and we both concluded with a “See you around.” 

He was unlike any person I had come across before when we began to spend more time together as the fall semester continued. Most of what I could extract from him in conversation was that he wasn’t a fan of the weather here in New England, and the noise, and the amount of wealth, and he thought some of the people were arrogant or rude, but he never said he missed home. Despite his critiques, he seemed content with his new surroundings, it was more just making the right sense of them. I brought him into my circle of friends I had made that semester. Once a specter, now turned human, the characteristic of Lazarus that we all seemed to like the most was his ability to party. He told us he was from ‘somewhere down south, in the mountains’ and that it would seem like a foreign country to us, but that we’d like the moonshine and the bourbon. He had an aptitude for being able to locate marijuana as well, we were never quite sure where he got it from. We weren’t sure if his stoicism was one of these ‘Southern values’, but he kept a straight face when he told us that he planned to stay at the dormitory throughout Thanksgiving to ‘get loaded’. 

I asked him if he wanted to come over for our family Thanksgiving. I didn’t live too far away. He said ‘no’. And when we all returned, the weeks of school before heading home for Winter Recess, we still continued to drink bourbon and smoke the Lazarus grass. Back in September, when we all began at this university, Lazarus was the last person I saw and thought to myself that he’d only skyrocket in popularity among our dormitory. Yet, when we spoke one evening, he had mentioned, with that straight face, that he was excited to largely stay at the dormitory once again over break, with a brief half-week visiting some distant aunt up in Maine. I asked him if he wanted to come stay with me, or any one of the folks in our friend group’s homes over the break. He said no. I asked if he was planning on going home. He said no. I asked him why. He said that the place from which he came was boring, that it was dead, that there was nothing down there except trouble. We shared a shot of bourbon before my parents picked me up and we buzzed off in the car. 

I didn’t see him much in January or February. Occasionally, he’d swing by our small parties and have a drink or two, but then he’d swiftly head out. I asked him one night, when he stopped by, if everything is alright, and he said he hated the cold. He said that as much as he didn’t want to return down southways, he would over the Spring recess. He said it in a low tone, like a dog humming, hungry on an empty stomach. It was only a few weeks away. He then told us also that where he’s from, that is where he got his grass. He said that the laws down there aren’t so puritan as up here. Most folks didn’t care as long as you kept to yourself. I began to wonder what kind of place produced Lazarus. I asked him if I could go with him, and he said ‘no’. When I leveraged that I would take him in my car, especially so that he wouldn’t now have to hitchhike to the bus station, he said alright - but we were just going for a few days. 

“You’re a man who likes risk if you come down to the mountains,” Lazarus said as we skidded just past New York, making our way down South. “People down here…it is a different world. But we’ll be alright. We just mind our own business, and we’ll be alright.” I didn’t say anything. I kept my eyes on the road. It rained heavily. I fiddled with the dial on the radio as we passed through various state lines. Soon, it seemed as though we were in a place where ‘New York’ was just an imagined image. It was flat at first, but the shadow of the mountains began to loom. It was like a giant wave ready to consume the sticks they raised and called homes. And these homes became less and less, especially as we began to climb. 

“Want to stop for a cigarette? We should now before it gets dark. Easy to lose your way up here, best we floor it to my place.” Lazarus says, staring inquisitively at the road ahead. We get out of the car. A consuming gray haze reduces the visibility of where we parked to far less than a mile. I filter a cigarette out of my pack, and hand it over to Lazarus. He leans over, lights it, and passes the lighter back to me. 
“This must be gorgeous when the fog clears up here, we’ve been gaining some serious altitude.” I say, with the butt end of my cigarette turning my words into a half-mumble. 
“Yeah, not too far now, a little more ways up the mountain. Then we grab our shit, we get everything into the house.” he pauses, and then looks to me, “You’re going to like my place, it’s old, but I take good care of it.”

And soon we’re off again, the car engine humming as we climb the mountain. 

The house is old, but as Lazarus said, it was in great shape. As we pulled up in the car, as night just began to pull its curtain over the mountain, he gets out of the vehicle and hauls our belongings inside. On one side of the home is a thick forest. In the evening breeze and cool mist, the trees sway as if they all seem to perform an ancient dance. The forest is alive, with insects humming and small creatures screeching that breaks the synchronized sway and ache of the swinging trees. 

“Hey!” Lazarus calls out in a muted tone. He stands on the old wooden front porch. “Let’s get our shit and move inside, man. I’ll take you ‘round tomorrow. Hopefully this damn fog will break.” And I move over to the car, and throw my duffle bag over my shoulder while slamming the car door closed. “Hey!” Lazarus calls out again in the same muted resistance, “Keep it down. We may be up on the mountain, but folks still live around here.” As I move closer to the porch, the sound of rushing water becomes present, and I can see a small river on the other end of the property, but not much beyond that, for the fog on the mountain is thick. “C’mon, now”, Lazarus has the door open, waiting for me to enter the home. 

The lights in the home are cold, and seem to flicker often. Lazarus says he prefers to use candles, so we light a few in the small kitchen area. I retrieve a bottle of bourbon from my bag. But he refuses, says that the first night here, maybe it is the altitude, is difficult to acclimate to. By candlelight, he gives me a brief tour of the home. The rooms are well decorated, but sparse. He shows me to my bedroom. It looks as though no one has been in there for years. Crosses and ceramic angels layered in dust occupy most of the shelves here. Lazarus continues the tour after I place down my duffel bag. “This here, this is the attic, it is my favorite room in the house. Spent a lot of time up here.” I ascend a few of the steps, and try to look around inside, with only the last light of the rainy day showing the silhouettes of trunks and maps. As I descend he tells me, sternly, “Remember the attic, my friend.” I was a bit nervous at this point, but upon the return to my room, I drank from the bourbon and stared in the dark room and listened to the primitive world outside. 

I woke up with a slight headache, and a knocking at my door. I yell out, “Just one second”, and swing open the wooden door. It’s very bright now, but the fog has yet to lift, but the little bit of rain that seemed to only leak from the sky has left. Lazarus looks as if he’s been waiting, but he seems excited, especially when he says, “Man, I can’t wait to show you my favorite breakfast spot.” We hop in the car, and begin descending down the mountain. The fog, like a watercolor palette of blended yellows and oranges, won’t allow the sun rays to fully break through its wall. As I rub my forehead, Lazarus begins speeding down the mountain quicker and quicker in my car. I tell him to take it slow. He says he’s just excited to get to town. What I initially imagined to be a five minute cruise turned into almost forty minutes of speeding down empty streets lined only with those tall, swaying trees. And finally, we seem to break out of the fog. I look in the mirror, and as we drive further in the sunrise, I can see the wall of the mountain. Even in the morning, it seems consumed by its own shadow. I turn forward as we move into a small town. Despite the warm spring sunshine, the town is a dismal limb of this world of Lazarus. A group of children smoke cigarettes in torn t-shirts as they seem to stare up at the mountain. A woman glares at us as we drive by, and I notice that she is pushing a shopping cart filled with some kind of soft padding. 

We pull into a largely empty lot. The diner that lay before my parked car is the cleanest building I’ve seen. As we step inside, the bell attached to the door rings, and a solemn woman looks up from her crossword. Lazarus waves limply. We sit on two stools towards the end, and she saunters over with a pot of black coffee. 
“Haven’t seen you around here in some time. You the O’Leary’s kid?” 
He nods, ushering forth his empty cup. 
“Where are your parents these days?” she asks, filling his cup with coffee that doesn’t seem to steam. 
“Florida.” Lazarus replies softly, redirecting his eye contact.  
I then move my cup towards the woman. She still looks at Lazarus. 
“Fastest family to move up that mountain and leave. I can say that.” 
A silence prevails, and she seems to switch her mood, and asks us what we’d like to eat. 

When our food comes, I can barely keep it together. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest. I think about where else I could’ve gone for Spring Recess. I start to pester Lazarus, quietly. 
“I don’t like this town, and the mountain.”
He sips his coffee, “Me neither. You wonder why I told you not to come?”
I begin to raise my voice, “Why didn’t you tell me your parents moved to Florida? Why don’t they live up there anymore?” 
He replies back in his unexpressive, stern manner, “It’s a bad market. There used to be a big industry in this town. But it is gone. There’s no money here anymore, okay?” 
The volume grows between us with every response. 
“It’s not the poverty, Lazarus - there is something there.”
“What the hell are you talking about?”
I look away from Lazarus and the waitress, and two men in a nearby booth all stare at us. I go quiet immediately. Lazarus looks around, and then back to his coffee. 
In a low tone, the waitress says without a blink, “His folks were right to move. The devil lives up in the mountain. And the devil’s angels roam the land’up there. Turn men into bones.”

We drive further away from the diner, away from the town, and down a few hills. I can’t find the capability to speak anymore. 
“Look, man.” Lazarus begins before a sigh, “The sad truth is that around here, people are prone to believing in old folk tales and religious crap.” 
I say nothing as we continue down the road. 
“Look at me as an example, right. I never believed in that shit. Sure, it’s creepy to hear about. But folks need ways to explain their own dire situations, so they blame some shit on the mountain. It’s just a sad circumstance. My folks were lucky enough to move over to Florida.”
In a break among the tree-lined road, there appears a gas station. Lazarus pulls the car into the back lot, and says to me, “Look, buddy. I’m glad you came down here, alright? I’m going to turn what started as a weird morning into a good night. Alright? And then we split tomorrow, okay?”
I nod, sigh, and tell him, “Yeah, alright.” He steps out of the car, and returns a few minutes later. He throws up each one of his hands, with one being a case of beer, and the other what seems to be a bag of weed. 

He throws a few logs into a small stove fire pit he has out behind the back door. The fog is still there, but a breeze blows through the mountain, and after the second beer, the sound of the trees and the wildlife in those dark woods seems less threatening. Even if I can still picture the stare and repeat the words in my head of what the woman at the diner said earlier. But nonetheless now, I had made my proverbial bed. I did choose to come down here, and Lazarus was right. He’d lived up here on the mountain for a while now before attending school. He wasn’t foolish enough to return to some haunted place. It almost reminded me of the history of my New England. The Puritans, terrified of the woods, woods that were now all colonial homes. 

Now a few beers deep, the sway of the trees is almost hypnotic. And as I return from my bedroom with the bottle of bourbon, I’ve witnessed something I’ve never witnessed before. As he rolls his marijuana cigarette, Lazarus tells a story about fishing on the Mississippi one year with his father. His old man caught something too big, Lazarus says, and tipped the boat over. And for the first time, I witness Lazarus break with laughter. Over the primitive symphony just beyond the pines, we cheers and begin passing the joint, back and forth. And as we regale stories to one another from our first year of school, and suddenly, an empty look appears on Lazarus’ face. I ask if he’s been missing college, noting his change in behavior. He tells me to be quiet. I notice that the hums and haws, the screeches and coos, and even now, the crickets have all ceased their calls. It is just the sway of the trees in the fog, and nothing else. Lazarus is wide-eyed. 

Just then, a scream, no less than half a mile away from where we sat. Lazarus pours his beer out in the fire before saying in a hushed but direct tone, “Attic. Attic. Now, go. Now”. He lies low as we move quickly towards the house. The scream, again, echoes, now just a bit closer. The sound seems to make the pines themselves shiver. It is an indescribable, ancient, guttural call. I feel nothing but the sense of flight as we run low into the house, and Lazarus closes the door and says, “No lights. Attic, now. We need to move.” In the darkness, I can see almost nothing. I feel frantically for the ladder. We ascend the ladder upwards and he follows behind. He closes the hatch after we ascend, and sits on top of it. I whisper, “Lazarus?” and I begin to feel fear begin to melt my entire being. He responds back, “If you say nothing, if you stay quiet, we will be alright.” 

I can hear the door in the kitchen open, but I hear no footsteps follow. I cannot move. I can no longer feel my body. All I do is sit and stare. From a pale light that filters through the attic window, I can see that Lazarus has his eyes shut tight. We both jump as we hear the door slam shut. Lazarus looks at me, and shakes his head as if to say we’re still not in the clear. And after that, time keeps passing on, and we sit as statues, before Lazarus whispers, “I think we can go now.” I ask if he means to grab what we brought, throw it in the car, and drive far away from this mountain. He says we can leave at night, that we won’t make it. And I ask him what it was, and he simply says, “I do not know. But I’ve seen it before.” The more questions I ask, the more he stays silent. Still sitting upon the trapdoor hatch, he now leans his back against the wall and closes his eyes. I realize then that there is nothing I can do but wait until dawn, so I ask, “Can I at least lay down up here?” And he sorrowfully nods his head. 

I can’t sleep. I watch the pale light from the window just barely bloom more luminous as the sun breaks in the new day, and don’t look over to Lazarus until that familiar, yellow-orange hue seems to wipe the wall beside me. I don’t think he’s closed his eyes. He just stares forward, but he’s simply stuck within his own mind. I say to him in a soft tone, “Lazarus” and he exits the state he’s in, and looks at me with a sense of melancholy, “Yes?”. 
“Can we go now?” I ask. 
He nods solemnly, “Yes. We need to be quick. Last thing we do is turn on that car of yours.”

I nod. He moves slowly as he lifts the hatch, and drops his head below, looking around inquisitively. “We’re good,” he says. As we descend, I begin to ask about what happened, but he stops me before I can finish the following sentence and says, “Look. When we get in the car, when we descend the mountain, I will tell you everything I know. But most of what I know is that we must leave, now.” I nod, and begin to sprint towards the room where I had stayed the first night. As I begin to get closer, I notice long carvings upon the wall. As if someone dragged a knife deep into the wood, and carved as they made their way to the room where I stayed. And then, I hold my breath as I slowly push open the bedroom door. My nose is immediately met with a smell of something rotten. Several flies buzz. The ceramic angels have all been crushed, and the crosses lay upon the floor. I lean forward, retaining my footing to look upon the other side of the bed, but there is nothing. I grab my bag and run back towards the car. 

I can’t find Lazarus. His bag is on the front porch. He’s nowhere near the car. I run back towards the stove fire pit. The woods howl with wildlife. The fog seems thicker than usual. As I make my way towards the other side of the property, where the small river lay, I yell out, “Lazarus?”. As I near the river, the forest quiets, but now, the fog seems to blow away like smoke from an extinguished fire. It lifts quickly. There is no Lazarus near the river, and my eyes follow towards the other side, where a large dirt mound begins to reveal itself foot by foot as the fog dissipates. And finally, I can begin to see the sky. But a figure begins to appear from behind the mound. It begins with one, and others seem to follow. I stand there, completely frozen, as I watch them ascend to the top of the dirt mound. As they stand in file, I look at each one of their mangled, distorted faces. Their skin is carved with intricate designs. Their faces are almost human, but equally missing features. The one in the middle, standing tall, points his finger at me. One of the creatures falls to all fours and descends the embankment rapidly, making its way towards the river. I begin to flee. I rush up the hill, back towards the house. Upon the side of the porch sits Lazarus, with tears down his face as he says to me, “We should’ve never come here. Now, it’s too late.”",4,1763314367.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

[24f/27m],"I’ve been living in a new city for less than a year and have had a hard time making friends here.  I go to work and back home during the week, and over the weekends I grocery shop and maybe have a coffee alone at a cafe.  That’s it, every week.  Sometimes I talk to my school friends on the phone but they are all busy people so it’s hard to find the time.  

My boyfriend is in a different country with a 4 hour time difference, I get to see him in person 1-2 times a year.  We video call maybe 3-5 hours every week.  It’s hard not to miss him.  He’s a lot better at the long distance thing than I am.  I feel like I’m constantly in crisis, and he’s completely unbothered, just living his life.

Unlike me, he has many friends.  Most from high school or college.  Which I’m happy about and I really like his friends.  But I can’t help but feel jealous when he goes out.  I wish that I could be with him.  Or I wish that he would just stay home safe where I can keep track of him.  I know this is such a toxic way of thinking.  I want him to be happy and have a life.  It just hurts that I can’t be a part of that.

Sometimes I’m not sure if I’m jealous of his friends for getting to hang out with him, or if I’m jealous of him for having a group of people around him.

1.  Gypsy says to someone, “Here is a list of things Ryan and I would like to do in my first three months after release. Kansas City, MO/Chiefs game, Meet Ryan’s family, Visit my parents in CutOff, LA for a weekend, Learn to drive, Follow my therapy sessions, New teeth consultation with dentist, Stay at Myrtles plantation haunted bed and breakfast located in St. Francisville, LA, New Orleans, LA Mardi Gras vacation, Adopt a puppy, Make a Wish donation (meet with representative of foundation), Southern Stone indoor climbing, Lafayette, LA, Vacation for Spring break during March 29- April 7th, to one of the following , Orlando, FL, Washington D.C, Aspen, CO.” 


2.  Gypsy says to someone, “Hey, I talked with Ryan and we feel like with the time frame we have to film our focus can be centerd around the family dynamics... so meaning Ryan’s family, me spending time with my family, ect. If they can wrap up at the beginning of April Ryan has spring break March 29th - April 7th and we can go on a vacation out of state. Just a thought. We will keep things pretty close to home for January/February and can film in New Orleans and CutOff as much as we need to. Again I am sorry if my reaction was abrupt I was not at all directing it towards you. I was directing towards the network because I feel like they don't have faith that people will be interested in my life. I am mentally preparing to film and do things in a layout with story arcs then it gets thrown up in the air, so I had a small pitty party for myself then re-adjusted and moved on positively Today was stressful but like you said, after this small window of filming I can get my cosmetic work done between gigs. :-) I just bought a selfie ring light for at home lol”


3.  Gypsy says to someone, “Ryan looked at every picture that Kristy and Dad brought over to our apartment in those huge bens and we found few older family photos but what we did find we scanned and will send either tonight or tomorrow. Unfortunately a baby photo of my mother when she was maybe a few months old was not in the mix. I've seen it but can't locate it.
I may try and reach out to my aunts for their help with any much older family photos. I hope this helps with our Ebook. I looked over the outline —someone— created and loved it” 


4.  Gypsy says to someone, “I want therapy to be a topic. I received a lot of group therapy in prison but not one on one therapy. I want to walk people through what I've done while in here to work on my mental health. Maybe we can talk about that the next time we film? I have all of my certificates at home of my completed group therapy classes.”


5.  Gypsy says to someone, “I feel like shit right now. Ryan looked online for Wagovy and it is still $1,100 after insurance. He doesn't want to pay that much and so he is going back to his Meta fast diet and when I said it doesn't work he became defensive and said fine he would go back to throwing up after eating. I hit a trauma trigger for him and now I feel terrible. :-( “ 


6.  Gypsy says to someone, “New Orleans Trip. February 10th-14th
FUN THINGS TO DO
Café Du Mon (Coffee and Pastry cafe)
Cats Meow Karaoke Bar on Bourbon St.
Aquarium Of New Orleans
Pat 'Brian's Restaurant (Date night with Ryan) Mardi Gras Parades

EMOTIONAL THINGS TO DO
Going back to the Ronald McDonald House
Going back to Children's hospital” 


7.  Gypsy says to someone, “Also I wanted to let you know that a woman named —someone— is trying to call you. -Someone— gave her your number. —Someone— is doing an interview for Netflixs I Am a Killer. She wants to get her story out there. Anyways, I talked with —someone— last night and she told me of her idea of mashing the EBook and the memoir together to make one book and I told her that I don't like that and want it as is. This book will be my legacy and the memoir will be amazing and outlive any show”, Gypsy says, “Podcast Ideas How do you feel about having a podcast that steers away from my life as the focus and instead the we chose topics that are worth talking about? I feel making it about my life may be redundant to the series and books. Maybe the podcast can be a way to break into advocacy. We may need to brainstorm about what specifically are those topics but the fact that I am talking about it will be what draws people in. Thoughts?”, Gypsy also says, “Podcast Ideas \#2 What if our topic was what my case is known for...Munchausen By Proxy?
We can bring guests on such as perhaps Beatrice Yorker who gave an interview in our docu-series, maybe we can see if we can interview Julie Gregory who wrote her memoir called Sickened'. We can get a doctor who specializes in MBP...we can get a phycologists as a guest. The point is I have exhausted myself of talking about myself, perhaps we can come at the angle of having discussions about the aspects of what MBP is and talk about my experiences in a subtle but engaging way.” 


8.  Someone asks Gypsy, “Crimecon
Crime con in Nashville would love to have you on the main stage. Do you want to do it? If so I can start the conversation with the conference leader and we can go together. I'm at an airport now and heading to see you for the last time in prison. I don't have the words to express how happy I am for you and the life you are soon to be experiencing. You will have an incredible 2024 and I'm honored to be apart of it!!”, Gypsy answers, “Yes I would like to be a guest at Crimecon :-) Can Ryan please be with me too?”


9.  Gypsy says to someone, “I did what was best for me and that is to break away from this friendship. I told Rachel Garlick that just like I wanted to believe my mother to love me. I wanted to believe she loved me too. I saw the red flags. I iust closed my eyes once I saw them.


10.  Gypsy sends someone an email she apparently sent to Rachel Garlick, “This is a copy of what I wrote to Rachel Garlick and maybe she might listen. if she still continues to post about me, I have to leave the friendship. Dearest Friend, I want you to know that love you. You have had my back on many occasions that people judged me for a crime I commited out of a desperate need to be free. Many people will never understand or comprehened the level of abuse I went through and I have confided in our friendship many of my past experiences. Throughout the years I've had to ""grow up"" in a environment that consists of ""What can you do for me mentality"" and had to learn fast who is a true friend and who is a ""fair weather friend"" or not a friend at all. Many cellies and bunkmates have come and gone who said that they would keep in touch, but never did, and I've had some who looked back just long enough to say the occasional hello, but you have remained a constant in my life ever since we first met in 2016. In January 2021 we had a misunderstanding and almost had a falling out because of people who just wanted to create drama between friends, but we became the winners in that round. :-) You have been a strong voice for me on social media showing people that I am just as human as anyone else, I make mistakes, I grow in character, and I find myself a little each day and my crime doesn't define who I am as a person.
You have been an appreciated voice for me because I could not have my own social media while incarcerated in order to defend myself to these individuals who do judge me or have questions about my life
But now going forward, my time is nearing the end of my imprisonment and I must go through a period of silence so that I may skillfully use my voice wisely when the right time comes. So my friend I must ask you to step back from the front line and let me emerge from the back to use the opportunity to use my own voice. I do not need someone to speak for me now. I have a voice, please let me use it when I feel it is necessary. People will have Gypsy hate groups and Gypsy support groups, but no one has the right to take my voice not even my best friend. I want to share my experiences my way and not through social media. I love you. Your best friend, Gypsy Rose”


11.  Someone sends Gypsy an email, which is forwarded from someone else, “So next time you talk to gypsy. Ask her about the doctor —someone—. Allegedly an ear nose and throat from Two Lane children's hospital in New Orleans. I think she has the name wrong. He doesn't exist. I'm wondering if the name is incorrct or spelling. I have —someone— a different ear nose & throat but not —someone—.” , Gypsy says, “Dr. Wisdom was the doctor who had placed tubes in my ears that is why I'm pretty sure he was ear, nose and throat at Tulane but I could be mistaken as to his department. I was only 12 when I would have seen him.”


12.  Gypsy says to someone, “These are a list of phone numbers of the family correspond with. I thought it might be helpful if you needed to get in contact with anyone for the documentary. GYPSYS FAMILY: Dad, Step mom, Sister, Brother, GMA fathers side, Cousin mothers side, Cousin mothers side, Aunt fathers side, Aunt mothers side, Aunt mothers side. Also these are the numbers of friends who I did talk with about signing an NDA and would be willing to if need be, and —someone— would sign one as well.”

The Interval  
  
The light shifting through venetian blinds, dust motes hanging suspended, and the humming of the refrigerator downstairs, constant, always there, and her coffee going cold on the nightstand, and the neighbor's dog barking at intervals, regular intervals, too regular, and the smell of something burning but distant, always distant, and her phone screen glowing with messages she's already read, reading them again, the same words, and outside the leaves moving but there's no wind, no wind at all, just movement, perpetual movement, and the wallpaper pattern that she's counted before, counting it again, finding new shapes in the repetition, shapes that weren't there yesterday or maybe were always there, and—

—when she realizes that the counting has been occurring not in sequence but in simultaneity, that each iteration of the wallpaper's pattern exists not as a discrete unit following the previous unit but as a collapsed state where all versions of the pattern occupy the same perceptual instant, she understands (or fails to understand, the distinction having eroded) that what she has been experiencing as temporal duration—the coffee cooling, the messages accumulating, the dog's rhythmic barking—has been a single stretched moment that refuses to complete, a thought waiting for its resolution that will never arrive, suspended in the architecture of her awareness which no longer possesses the structural integrity to distinguish between what is repeating and what is being repeated, between the observer counting patterns and the pattern observing her count, all of it suspended until the only certainty remaining is that meaning itself has become a property not of the world but of the dissolution that the world was always undergoing, has always been, will always be undergoing in this precise arrested instant that has no referent outside itself.

It hurt really bad for a bit but went away and the next morning it was sore.

I have always had some irritation in my arm when sitting at a laptop the whole day with work. So in the following days I had this as well and also some discomfort sleeping but nothing bad, I did not think anything of it. Just more than usual. Just went about my days normal, workouts etc. 

Until after about 6 days when I did a lift at the gym and did neutral pull ups instead of the chin ups I did earlier that week. My whole arm hurt, ring/pinky finger numb etc. It went away after a few hours and thought it was fine. The day after on friday I worked the morning and got pain at lunch after and this happened a few times that day on an off. Saturday was okay during the day but still some numbness/sensitivity. 

Last night (saturday to sunday) I got really bad pain and numbness when I went to bed to the point I could not sleep for most of the night, eventually with the tiredness, a painkiller and a pillow under my arm I fell asleep. Today its not as bad as the night but still painfull and numb the whole day.

It has been like 10 days and seems to even be getting worse by the day, I read about cubital tunnel syndrome. Would it be a good idea to get this checked out or should it heal by itself with avoiding lifts/bending etc?. I dont know what to do.",1,1763313530.0,CubitalTunnel,1,1.0,False

I finished my CPA in 2020 and took a job at a private accounting firm in NYC.  I had good times where work and life was manageable, but I also had times where I was constantly missing days due to severe stomach cramping and an inability to get off of the toilet in the morning.  My manager and I had a lot of conversations, and it was hard for him to understand that IBS could be that debilitating, but ultimately we decided it would be best for me to take some time to focus on me getting right.

I have spent this time off fully committing to trying to get my IBS under control, and have taken a lot of tips from other people on this sub so I wanted to share what has helped me the most so if anyone is in a similar position they can hopefully find some relief.  I’m not all the way there yet but I’m probably 80% better as of now. Anyways, here’s my list.


ABSOLUTELY NO ALCOHOL.  This has proven to be my biggest IBS trigger.  I quit drinking entirely, not even a social drink at dinner and it made a huge difference.

Strict diet. No simple sugars.  No high fat/greasy meals.  I started with just boiled chicken and brown rice and slowly added foods to make sure I could tolerate them.  Limited myself to one cup of coffee a day and never on an empty stomach. Everyone has different food triggers so start with something safe and see what works and doesn’t work.

Drinking more water.  I do at least 90 ounces of water everyday.  Aside from my cup of coffee I drink nothing besides water.  No artificial sweeteners.  No real sugar beverages.  Nothing carbonated.  

Pepsin GI supplement.  It has zinc L-carnosine that is supposed to heal the stomach and intestinal lining.  I take two in the morning and one at night.  

byeBS supplement.  It has psyllium husk, peppermint extract, slippery elm and L glutamine.  Recommended to me by my functional med doc and seems to help a lot with my bloating and gas pains.  I take three in the morning and three at night.

Seed probiotic.  I know probiotics are controversial and hurt some of you, but seed has seemed to really help me.  I take it in the morning with breakfast.  Makes me feel a lot less gassy and decreased my bloating.

Lastly, I really have focused on my mental health.  Anxiety is a trigger for IBS there’s a massive neural network in the gut.  I’m doing therapy twice a week and have been taking amitripyline 10mg for pain.  If you focus on the mental I promise you, you will feel better.  Whether you had anxiety before your IBS or you developed it from constantly being in pain. 

Happy to be a support if anyone needs.  I was in the lowest point in my life a few months ago, and 
now I’m climbing my way back.  So if anyone is feeling as lost as I was, hang in there

Truly a magical time of year, the fog hugged the forest tightly this morning as I wound through the twists and bends of the hills near my home. I seemed to have been up before most on this gloomy Sunday. Solemnly quiet was the air, save for the sounds of my engine ricocheting off the asphalt as I carved my way into town, and the elk bugling in the distance. Quite a juxtaposition cutting through the frosty still. 

The daylight woke with me as I drank my coffee, and slowly, the daytime traffic began, the birds chirping, cars honking, and people talking. In hearing this I knew my family would soon wake. So, just as fast as I arrived, I readied myself, and saddled my trusty bike. I turn the fuel petcock, and give her just a touch of choke, and just like thousands of times before, she roars to life on a half turn, as if to affirm me that the miles are just a number, and that I know I’ll arrive to my destination unperturbed. 

Into the pine laden forest we travel again, the morning fog now envelops the ground tightly as the headlight beam projects a wide cone ahead. Now, on the way back in. The earth around us is awake. Squirrels scavenge, and the birds chirp, and people start their morning fires. We only stop briefly to document the scenery around us. 

Then we arrive home as the family comes to life, awake in a way that only those that live life in two wheels can understand. To those of us who ride through the seasons less travelled, I recommend starting days with a ride and a coffee, and coming alive by doing what makes us feel most so. And here I type this from the warmth of home. Thinking about when next I can go out and chase the sunrise.

Walking out of the cathedral I asked her “Did you know the child that disappeared?”

Lucia laughed “yes, little Constantin Coman, such a cute little boy.  I would at times watch him and his sister Adelina when their mother had to leave for a few days”.

I pulled the reins from the hook and wrapped it around the horse's head “Yeah I remember when I was a boy I had the biggest crush on my baby sitter”. Lucia looked at me confused “baby SITTER? Why would this woman sit on babies?”

A sharp involuntary laugh hit my chest, at times I forgot Lucia is not a native english speaker. “A baby sitter is a girl who watches children while their parents are away”. She looked at me as I hopped up.  She scoffed, “Well this is a stupid name for a Bonă.” I replied “Bonă?”.

“Yes a Bonă, it's like a nanny. There is a German word for a nanny that is similar to baby sitter, though I suppose I never really thought about it too much” she leaped up behind me on the horse once again pressing her face into my shoulders. I replied “I suppose I didn’t really think about the meaning behind baby sitter too much either, some words just end up being a word for something rather than a description of it over time.”

The horse trotted off away from the church, it was about mid-day now, and Lucia assured me Mrs. Coman’s house was on the way back to St. Michaels. The horse seemingly listened to her directions better than I did. I decided to get back on the topic at hand, “You know what English word I like the most? Scoot. It's just a word that sounds like what you’re doing. I'm scootin’ along, rolls off the tongue” Lucia piped up from behind me “I think we found the horse's name, how does that sound?”

“Scoot? Why not scout, there's a good name and it's only one syllable off” I said.  Lucia huffed “I wasn’t asking you, I was asking the horse, how does this sound Scoot?” Scoot lurched his head back and gnawed at his bit. “See Herr Morning, he likes it.” I still think it's a dumb name for a horse but as long as scoot responds to it I guess that's all that matters.

We arrived at Mrs. Coman’s house near the edge of town. It was a little bland villa with rounded rock walls that looked like they hadn't been maintained. I let Scoot graze for a little bit on the overgrown grass in the front yard while Lucia and I knocked at the door. A young girl answered, she was dreadfully thin with thick brown hair that stopped right at her shoulders and tattered bangs sweeping across her eyelashes.  Lucia’s lungs emptied as the child slammed into her for a big hug. They began to speak a foreign language, im assuming Romanian as it did not have the harsh characteristics of the german dialect. One word I did recognize was “Scoot” as the child ran over to Scoot, picking grass and pressing it against the poor beast's face.

What I can only assume is Mrs. Coman came to the door. She seemed sweet but frantic, like a spot of rain during a sunny day. Her and Lucia exchanged some words, eventually she gestured over to me with the only word I can recognize as “Lieutenant Morning” I figured that was my queue so I placed one hand over the small of my back and one over my stomach giving a short polite bow. Not sure why I bowed. I guess I just didn't know how to introduce myself in any other way. Suddenly I felt a little silly for it, and had hoped maybe they'd just assume that's customary where I'm from.

Mrs. Coman invited us in and we sat in the front room. Her words started to get a little more intense, and Lucia’s responses were getting quicker. Finally Lucia turned to me “uh she says yesterday Constantin went to go play and he never came home, Mrs. Coman have been searching some of the spots she knows he likes to go”. I asked where he liked to go, Lucia began interpreting, and after getting the response from Mrs Coman Her fierce green eyes grew darker. “He played in the woods south east of St. Michaels” before I could respond Lucia began arguing with Mrs. Coman. Exasperated she said “Apologies Herr Morning, these woods are known to be dangerous, wolves and other unsavory creatures have been known to live there. I am upset that she lets her boy play there, she says he is 10 and nearly a man, and he goes where he likes.”

I ask Lucia where the father of the child is. The mother, clearly understanding the English word for father, spits on the floor and begins ranting in her own language. Lucia turned to me before she was finished and informed me “The father left them 8 years ago, never so much as told them where he was going”. I replied “I apologize I should not have pried at that sensitive subject” with the mother still cursing the father lucia gently reminded me “You are trying to find Constantin, it’s your job to ask these questions.”

Lucia had looked genuinely troubled as we left the cathedral, her worry for the missing boy written plainly across her face. These woods, I supposed, were the kind the Brothers Grimm might have whispered about. I felt my own concern rising with every step; from the way she spoke, I had half expected the boy to be waiting safely at the Comans’ doorstep when we arrived.

After a few more questions that got me no closer to finding the boy, we said our goodbyes and rode off back to St. Michaels. My mind raced, thinking of poor Adelina without her brother. If he had left only the day earlier it’s a real possibility he’s still alive. We only need to find some evidence of him going into the woods. Lucia and I began to worry since the cold night was quickly approaching, every night he spends out there the risk of him not coming home alive goes up, We don't have much time to waste.

As the Headquarters rounded into view I could see the new encampment the boys had set up while I had been gone. They moved uphill just outside of the courtyard of St. Michaels near my shack.  A site I was happy to see after witnessing that creepy face in the corner of my room last night.

Their new camp had a sign post raised above the entrance “Aceldama”, a fitting name for the Outpost. Under it was Sergeant O'Toole talking with his two squad leaders.  They could sense something was wrong.  “Whatchya got boss?” uttered Corporal Bush. I began to catch them up on the meeting with Father Simon and Mrs. Coman, making sure to stress the importance of finding the kid and gaining the trust of Hermannstadt.  They seemed to be in agreement, in fact I haven't seen these boys so intent on doing anything in the last three weeks of being their commander. I wondered if they were just happy to get an order that could actually help somebody for once.

O’Toole rubbed his calloused hands over his gritted face “We should go about this smart, Bush take your men on the southern end of the forest, Pike, you’ll go north. And sir, if you don't mind I think we should go straight up the middle. We’ll leave the horse here, he’ll be no use in that thicket. Oh, and for god’s sake someone make us a fucking pot of coffee, We’re not stopping until we find the boy.”

I said goodbye to Lucia, and packed my ruck with the essentials to stay overnight in the forest.

The camp erupted into motion and before we knew it we were ready to go. Pikes squad took a right at the church and followed the woodline north, Bush’s squad hugged the ridge heading south, before I knew it the silhouette of their bodies against the setting sun descended into the blackness of the deep valleys.

The sun slipped beneath the edge of the sky, and the warmth went with it drawn out of the air. The world turned brittle and still, the ground tinted in a blue, quiet cold. I felt suddenly misplaced, as if the day had forgotten to take me with it.  Yet I charged on brushing past the tall grass into the pines that stretched before me.

The bitter dark swallowed us as we stepped deeper into the woods. O’Toole and I raised our flashlights, their warm bulbs hissing to life. Thin beams cut through the trees, stretching across the tall, narrow trunks like searching fingers. We swept the light left to right, then back again, hypnotic and methodical; hunting for footprints, a torn scrap of cloth, anything that might guide us.

From the distance we could hear the wolves howling. I looked back at O’Toole, “Would probably help if we called out for Constantin right?”. O’Toole spoke up from behind me “Apologies sir, I’m used to light and noise discipline on patrols”.

We called his name into the dark, only for the wolves to answer, their howls drowning our voices before we tried again. For hours we combed the rolling folds of those hidden woods. The forest felt alive, aware, guiding us down narrow game trails that drew us deeper into the unknown. All we could do was follow, because the only way forward was to let it lead.

Suddenly we heard a distant call of “Constantin!” just as we had been calling it. Knowing we were gonna intersect with CPL Pike soon we decided to head towards the distant calling like a wolf to the pack.

As we trekked, the pines thinned without warning, their evergreen rigidity giving way to a hollow where life seemed to hold its breath. In the center stood a cluster of deciduous trees, creeping lifeless things, their branches clawing faintly at the black above. The darkness here was a pitch. A thick tar that had learned to expand. It crept around us, clinging to our coats and skin, swallowing the sound of our own footsteps.

The trees had shed their leaves only a short time ago, their limbs drawn in tight, as if in some deep, dreamless sleep. Yet there was something familiar in their stillness, a patience that didn’t belong to sleep but to waiting. Waiting for spring. Waiting to wake. Waiting for life. As the wind slid between the pines, even the air seemed careful not to disturb them.

I heard the familiar “constantin” but this time it was a slight whisper echoing across the dead leaves. I turned my flashlight to the source of the frustration. Only to see a twisted and knotted oak with hollow dead vines winding its way up the trunk.

Suddenly one of the vines began to move across the trunk tucking itself away. In a brief flash I recognized it not as a vine, but as an arm. I lurch forward yelling “Constantin!” but O’Toole pulled my jacket “Sir, we gotta go.” I protested “It could be Constantin! We gotta look”, but O’Toole dragged me “You’re seeing things sir, Now hurry up or we’ll miss the rendezvous.” We continued east for a while. Occasionally I'd hear what sounded like “Constantin” from behind me, but it was cracked and compressed.  I’d go to turn my flashlight around and O’Toole would pull it back forward. “It’s just a raven mocking us, keep walking” he said in a hushed and hurried voice.

Eventually we left the blackness of the hollow and into a clearing where the waning crescent of the moon lit our way forward. Ahead flashlights danced against the rigidly straight pine woodline across the clearing and we walked towards the voices of Corporals Pike and Bush.

“O’Toole why couldn't we just look? Why were you in such a rush to get out of there?”. O’Toole kept his course and pulled me in closer as if someone could hear us. “As soon as we heard Constantin the wolves stopped howling.”

“What?” I exclaimed in a dulled voice.

He continued, “If it’s one thing I learned, when the animals are silent you should follow their lead.” Frustrated that he was speaking in riddles, I decided to speak plainly, “I saw an arm…I thought it could be the boys.” he interjected, “I know, I saw it too. That was no boy's arm, it had too many veins to be from a kid, whoever that was, was no friend to us.”

We paced through the field, our weary hearts quickened by the events that just took place. The night air bit deep and made my chest feel banded in iron. We creaked through the woodline like a willow branch. On our approach one of the men shined their flashlights at us “Jesus sir, way to scare us” I could recognize Cpl Pike’s voice anywhere. His uniform was smeared with the earth. The boy looked frayed, like a wool coat beaten against stone. O’Toole whispered behind me “It wasn't hard to find you, you all sound like a bunch of elephants stampeding through the forest.” “An elephant would be a welcome sight in these woods,” Bush said, kicking frozen leaves from his boots.

I pulled us into a huddle so that our hushed words could not be heard by friend nor foe, “Sounds like someone was also giving you boys a fright out there.” CPL Bush responded “more like something, not someone.” We all looked down at the ground knowing that though it sounded crazy he was right, there was something wicked about these woods.

We all knew these woods weren’t safe, something was out there lurking in the night. To make it out while it's still dark we would have to patrol silently and without the aid of flashlights; a task that may have been doable under the cover of a full moon, but no such luck was with us tonight, these woods proved to be too dangerous to navigate at night. We all decided we should make a scout camp and ruck out at first light.  Pike pointed out a defensible ridge near an abandoned hut a km north that felt “safe” to him. With the plan settled we went up and down the line tapping the shoulders of the men to move out. Soon enough we were in formation ready to ruck to the top of the ridge.

We were all scared, though none of us had the guts to say it. Naturally we all fell back on what we knew; be alert, move silent, and communicate. The foundation of being a good soldier and what’s kept them alive, for the most part. Being hunted was something I'm sure none of these men have gotten used to, but for me it was exhilarating. Some part of me smiled at the game we’d stumbled into.

We arrived at the location weary and ready to make camp. “No fires tonight” CPL Bush whispered around the line. We were going to do this the way the scouts did in the wild west, that meant no tents, no fires, no lamps, and half of the men would be asleep while half were awake watching for threats. With the rules understood we all hunkered down on the freezing ground. O’Toole asked me to take the first watch, I reckoned he wouldn't be able to sleep with the adrenaline. With that settled I placed my ruck on the ground, rested my head, and fell asleep.

I woke up to the Sgt shoving my shoulder. “Sir, it's time for your watch.” I cracked my eyes open only to see more darkness. The slight waning crescent of the moon only provided outlines across the night sky.

“Anything to Report?” I said tiredly.

“A couple noises here and there, the men are still pretty jumpy.” I cracked my bones to an upright position and told the SGT to get some rest. I pulled out my watch to check the time but I could scarcely read the dials under darkness. It looked like 2am, possibly 3am.

I sat there counting down the minutes to dawn for what felt like forever. Scanning the horizon for an unfamiliar figure. I could see some of the soldiers upright, we had all settled into a triangle formation around two pine trees. They were clutching their rifles and huddling near their watch partners for warmth. I began to shake and shiver; normally I liked the cold, it felt clean on my skin, but out here exposed every breeze felt like hot needles pressing against my body. My fingers began going numb from the chill, my lungs burned with every breath I drew and a cold clammy sweat began to fill my pits. This was agony.

What felt like days passed by as I sat on that ridge fighting off a fever the cold wrought against my body, scanning, listening for any creature to come in the night. I scanned to my left as I had done a hundred times before during this long watch that never ended, taking comfort in the fact my men were right there going through the same experience as me. I scanned to my right until my eye line passed the two trees at the center of the formation, but this time there was more than just trees. Between the two pines stood a third shape. Legs straight, arms at its sides, head positioned in perfect posture. It looked as if his silhouetted torso motionlessly rested upon stilted legs. A pit grew in my stomach. I suddenly found myself too weak to get up.

From the formation I heard a hushed voice call out to the man “ hey finish your piss and get back to your watch”. The man's head craned to the source of the noise, then he sulked back to the line and knelt down like a camel. Two hollow thunks rang out as he placed his knees onto the dirt, and sat back onto his feet. His silhouette sat straight and stared off in the distance. I turned back to my own sector knowing something wasn't right. We were all shivering, but he remained motionless, in the back of my mind I knew he wasn't one of us. I turned back to see him staring against the night sky. Who was this man?

The first rays of sunlight started to crest the hill. I knew now was the time to confront the shadow. I stared at my legs slowly coming into focus, grabbed my pistol, and careened my hollow neck to the figure. Except he wasn't there. Below where he sat, against the shadow of the ridge he was crouched over a body, it was a sinewy man dressed in nudity with furled black hair.

The sound reached me before the sight of it; a wet gnawing, steady and patient. When he raised his head I saw pallid eyes blown wide and lidless, jaws pulling at the flesh, teeth working the throat like a dog worrying a bone it means to splinter. It did not seem to even notice me, the entirety of his focus was on the consumption of a human.

I went to yell but only a yelp could find my voice.  As I heard the other men rustling, noticing what’s happening, I pulled my pistol, aimed and took a shot. Striking the creature on top of the shoulder.  I shot again, this time landing a blow straight to its eye. The creature rolled off its prey and began to run down the hill, arms flailing at its side.

By this time the rest of the platoon posted on a line and began cycling their shots into the foul beast. Except it kept running despite being hit more than a dozen times, a deep roar of pain filled the valley below us echoing across the ridges like a melody.

I ran over to the body and saw Private Halsin with a chunk of flesh missing from his throat. Pink blood bubbled from his wound with every gasp of air he took. One of the soldiers turned on his flashlight, I could see a mist escaping from his throat and whisking off into the frigid air. He looked over to me gasping and struggling just to meet my gaze. I’ll never forget the sound of his death rattle, that barbled from deep inside of him as if his soul was being parted from his body.  I’ll never forget the look of fear in his eyes as the young boy, only 17, struggled to draw his final breaths.

SGT O’Toole whispered out “You stupid boy.” He was staring straight at private halsin’s watch partner. “You stupid boy” his voice grows louder now. “You stupid boy. You stupid boy. You stupid boy!” He stepped over Halsin and with the back of his hand struck the negligent private across his face. He crouched over him with his hands rung around his collars. “Private Breck” his voice spit venom at the utterance of his name “You lazy sack of shit. Up! Up damn you!” He effortlessly threw the boy to the side.

O’toole hung his head low, and pushed his dusty hair back as he turned to him once more. “You will carry Halsin back, if you fall out of formation so help me god I will slit your fucking throat. This is your albatross to bear, do you understand me?”

Young Private Breck laid down splayed across Halsin on the ground. He tucked himself into the limbs of the lifeless corpse and attempted to get up. He struggled, with each try his breaths became heavier. One of the other men stepped in to help out of pity.

O’Toole pushed him aside, “Do not help him! He’s lost his right to be helped.” Private Breck continued to struggle moving the lifeless corpse of his friend. O’Toole barked at him again “I hope you remember this every night you fall asleep. You gotta carry this burden for the rest of your life because you couldn’t stay awake for one night on watch.”

Eventually by sheer will power Breck found the right angles to position Halsin on his shoulders. With no hesitation we set off back to St. Michael’s. I felt bad for the boy, in some ways, in a lot of ways, the punishment seemed cruel.

The war is over, yet still, not following orders leads to a harsh punishment.  The war is over, yet still, young men die during their watch. The war is over, yet still, we’re so far from home. The war’s not over, so I’ll carry Halsin’s weapon next to mine.

We trapse gently through the forest north as it seemed like the easiest route to go. Past the abandoned hut eerily in the distance we trudged along. We moved silently across the hills and valleys apart from the gasping of air from private Breck in the back struggling to keep pace.

Though it seemed cruel I could understand the harsh method. Halsin’s last moments were a desperate grasping for breath and now Breck must suffer the same fate with the weight of the man he failed on his shoulders. It serves as a harsh reminder that mistakes cost lives. We simply have no room to give a man some slack.

As the forest grew thinner I could hear some of the men discuss the creature we saw. Their words snapped me back to a reality that my sanity hoped was a hallucination. The mechanical eyes of the beast gnawing at the throat of someone I knew was an image I think would stick with me for a lifetime.

O’Toole caught up with me, “I’m glad your colt seemed to scare him off sir.”

“Yeah I don’t really think it bothered him all that much to be honest, I just wanted that thing off my soldier” I said a bit plainly.

O’Toole, silent for a moment, spoke out “I don’t actually remember the first man I killed, coulda been a grenade, or a pot shot, not sure. To be honest it never bothered me none” I believed him. For the first time I can truly understand what would drive a man to wanna kill another man.

He continued “I remember the face of every man who died under my watch though. That’s what’ll stick I tell ya. Keeps me up sometimes. You get used to death but no man ever gets used to loss”

I’d been cold but I could tell this conversation was important to him so I humored him “do you hate them?”

O’Toole had an answer that surprised me “nah, I don’t think hate’s the right word for it, shit I don’t think there is a word for what I feel for them.” I belly out a saddened sigh “I’m sure the Germans weren’t like that thing though”

O’Toole placed his hand on my shoulder “I actually think we’re all like that thing.  When I saw it chowin down Halsin, it didn’t have any hate in its eyes. It was just eating. Cus it’s gotta eat. The krauts killed us cus they gotta kill us, we killed them cus we gotta kill em. Eventually it just becomes instinct. The labels, good, evil, hate, purpose, I dunno. It’s just something else entirely I think.”

He fell back to his men, leaving me to play back the events in my head. My head was sickened with questions I felt there’d be no answer to.  Peaking through the pine curtains I saw St. Michales proud against the hills of the black forest, I’d never been more relieved to see it.

Once we stopped at headquarters Breck fell to his knees and the lifeless body of Halsin fell to the dirt. O’Tool looked down on Breck “Quit being dramatic boy. Put Halsin in one of the crates, and we’ll find out what to do with him once the captain comes at the end of the week.”

Luckily the cold would keep his body from stinking too bad while we wait. I stuck around for a bit, letting the boys know I'm proud of them for how they composed themselves during the night. Their morale was understandably much lower than yesterday morning. They were scared, we were all scared, yet still we must press on. After a while I wandered back up to the shack to report on the incident.

I flicked the radio giving my report in little detail “25 assigned, 24 present, one killed on mission.” the radio reported back “cease all operations until Sunday."" An order I was happy to receive. Though I'm sure Mann was stirring to get on the next train to Hermannstadt to see what the hell could have killed Private Breck. Yet the next stage won't come until Sunday, so he’ll have to wait.

I lit the fire in my stove, huddled against it for warmth, then turned my eyes to the sweet relief of sleep. I don't remember sleeping that much in my life. Only occasionally waking up to stoke the flames before falling back into a deep restful sleep.

I woke up again right after dawn the next day and decided to force my body to stay awake. Walking out I noticed a thin sheet of snow across the ground, it looked like talcum powder dusted across the dead grass. The men were cooking up some breakfast again so I decided to make the short walk over to their camp.

Corporal Bush said his good mornings and added “Lucia was looking for ya yesterday sir, I let her know you were sleeping.” I poured myself a nice hot cup of coffee from the percolator and replied “You let her know what happened?” He replied “Told her wolves got one of us. I think she knew better though, smart that one.” I cleared my throat with a sip of dark roast before I said “I don't think it takes a genius to know 25 men armed to the teeth could’a fought off a couple of wolves. I’m not worried about convincing her what happened, I am worried about convincing Captain Mann though.”  Bush Replied “Ah, well at any rate she’s coming by again today after 9.”

“Well she could help me write those memos to the new government for some extra supplies. But Captain Mann made it clear we’re not to move from the garrison until he arrives.” The men around the campfire seemed relieved to hear the news. The Previous mission had taken its toll on everyone.

The men went back to talking and I had resolutely taken a back seat in their conversation. Corporal Bush and Corporal Pike began arguing about whether or not they thought the thing we encountered was dead, Pike had obviously taken the position that he sent 5 rounds directly into its spin and he was sure it sat on the forest floor dead. Bush, in his superstition, believed the thing wasn’t human and it was still out there.

After a while I took my leave sending off another transmission for the day updating Captain Mann on our stagnant status. Then I went about the chores around the camp before I saw Lucia approaching the stone wall at the top of the hill. I wasn't as excited to see her today as I was the day before. I felt like she’d known what was in those woods but didn't warn us.

I walked over to her and before I could say good morning she embraced me. “I’m sorry I heard about the man you lost, where is he?” I ushered over to the crate at the front of the camp with a blanket of snow covering the soft plywood, “Over there, c'mon lets get out of the cold, we got some stuff to talk about.” As we walked further up the hill to the shack she kept looking back at the supply box.

I pulled up a chair for her near the radio and asked “coffee?” - “Just a little bit thank you” she rotated the cup in her hands, fidgeting with the question she wanted to ask, “your men say this was a wolf. Must’ve been pretty big.” The words hung in the air for a moment. “You know it wasn’t a wolf Lucia.” She continued to rotate the cup of coffee on the table. “Well if it wasn't a wolf what was it Herr Morning?” - “A man..but not a man, he was naked, cold, feral, and a funny way of escaping death”  she had stopped rotating the cup. Softly but matter of factly she spoke “That is because he’s already dead.”

Those words two days ago would have made me laugh, but now it makes more sense than any other hair brained theories Corporal Pike had been spouting. “You must believe me, Herr Morning. Those woods have many dangers, but the strigoi is something else, it’s something meant to frighten you, drive you away.”

I asked her what the hell just killed my soldier. With a long sigh she began to tell the story. “Many years ago,” she said, “there lived a woman and her husband, happy as two birds sharing one branch. But one day the husband fell terribly ill. The woman grew desperate, she prayed over him night and day, and she tried every tincture, every root, every little plant she believed might trick death into walking past her home. But the sickness only grew stronger, and in the end, the man died.”

She paused, her eyes drifting as if she could still see the memory in the air.

“The woman was broken,” she continued softly. “Her heart was shattered. She began to pray not to God anymore, but to the devil himself, begging him to return her husband. And the devil… he answered. He told her exactly what to do.”

I felt the cold move through me as she kept speaking.

“One night, under no moon, the woman went to the cemetery. She dug up her beloved with her bare hands. His heart was rotten, black like wet soil. She tore it out. Then..” she tapped her own chest “she reached into herself and gave him a piece of her own heart. But when she put the heart back into her husband’s chest, it did not beat. She cried and cursed the devil for his lies.”

Her voice dropped to a whisper.

“And then… the man opened his eyes. But he was not her husband anymore. He rose and fed on her first. After that, he wandered the countryside like a beast set loose, killing pigs, sheep, people… leaving bodies pale and empty, like someone had drained them with a giant needle.”

She looked at me, her face pale in the fire's light.

“The city begged the devil again, this time to tell them how to stop the creature. And for a price, he did. ‘A stake through the heart,’ he said, ‘and fire to finish it.’ So the folk hunted the monster, and they killed it at last. But not before…” She hesitated. “Not before its evil had time to spread.”

The stove began to rattle, the hiss of heat came to a mear whimper. I rocked myself out of my chair tossing a couple more pieces of wood in the fire. I clutched the last piece of wood in my hands for a moment, turning it in my hands. “Wooden stakes huh? Guess the dime novels got that one correct.” I turn to Lucia, “do you believe these stories?” Lucia finally grasped her cup of coffee and pulled it close to her chest, “I do Herr Morning.”

I stormed out of the shack towards the crate “Pike! Bush! O’Toole! grab some men and meet me by Halsin! And bring some of those cedar tent spikes with ya!” I charged towards the box containing Halsin, as I peered on the other side of the crate I noticed a couple dead rats, some blood, and mud smeared across the sides. “Pike! I believe that Bush won the argument, that thing was a vampire.” They rushed to the corners of the box readying their stakes. “Stakes and fire that’s what Lucia said. But we’re not gonna burn it, not yet anyhow. We need to keep it alive-er dead?” – “undead?” Pike interrupted – “Right, we need to keep undead until Captain Mann gets here, that's when we’ll burn it. Until then we need to keep it sedated. On the count of three, lift the lid and I'll stake it. 1…2….3”

The lid broke open, and there lay Halsin inside the box, no frostbite, no rot, nothing to show he’d been dead at all. He looked as though he were only sleeping. I hesitated, just a heartbeat, before driving the splintered stove wood straight into his chest.

Suddenly Halsin began slamming his fists into the side of the crate rhythmically. The bones of his hand began to crunch from the impact. One of the men slammed his E-tool into the stake driving it further into halsin’s heart. He began gasping for air again as if he was reliving his last moments. His eyes began to open, staring straight at me. I quickly lunged the full weight of my body against the stake driven into his chest and began to corkscrew it until I could feel the wood behind his back dulling the wood like a pestle and mortar.  Luckily his eyes began to shut once more.

“More stakes” I bellowed while still crouched over Halsin.  The men began to spear his limbs to the crate. By the time they were finished he looked like an insect proudly pinned on a frame, each extremity splayed and pierced in the most spectacular fashion. Not a single drop of blood was visible from any of the wounds we’d left behind.

After the gruesome task I drolled out orders, “Alright boys now that we know what we’re dealing with, secure Halsin then fashion some instruments to defend yourselves.”  Corporal Pike spoke up, “we found an empty sarcophagus in the church. We can probably lock him away under that stone”, I began to walk back towards the shack “do that, and put 2 on 24 hour watch.  O’Toole! See to the preparations, that things gotta put on a show once Captain Mann comes.”",3,1763313298.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

“I’m sorry, there's nothing I can do for you, the War’s over”, replied the Colonel.

“Wait, hold on just a minute, I didn't come all the way here just to pack it in and go home, give me something god-damnit”.



Colonel Stutz tensed his face, and shot me a look that’d pin a rottweiler’s tail between its legs.



“How about you stand at attention lieutenant…” he searched my eyes in hopes he could find my name. I was almost too hesitant to respond.





“...Morning. I-it’s Lieutenant Morning” I managed to screech out.





“Well anyways Lieutenant, I dont got nothing for ya. Our goal right now is to get our asses back home before our wives find a new husband. You should be fucking happy you’re not face up in the mud right now.”



My heart broke. I’m the only Lieutenant in my regiment who hasn’t seen combat. I'm the fool of an officer who showed up to the greatest war this world has ever seen a week after it ended. I should have enlisted and shipped out as soon as the Americans got involved, but instead I stayed at west point.



My eyes began to drag across my face, my fists clenched to the sides of my leg, I was holding back every emotion I had behind my sullen sorry face.

Colonel Stutz eyed me, lowering his temper like a tea pot being taken off the stove.

“Look, I get you want to be involved, but there is no more fighting. We showed up 5 months ago and kaiser tucked his tail and surrendered. We’re all ready to put the great war behind us.” 



“Sir you stamped your name in the history books, Let me stamp mine, Everyone in this regiment has been fighting since day 1 of the American campaign, let me help clean it up at the very least. I know we’re heading home but if you could reassign me to a unit that is staying here.  I heard a rumor from some of the enlisted that General Pershing wants men for his American Expeditionary Forces, I just want to be able to go home having accomplished something…anything.”  I wasn’t sure if I was allowed to talk but the words slipped past my lips. 

Colonel Stutz breathed an exasperated sigh, I could tell he felt sorry for me, “I don’t know what you hope to accomplish, but I’ll reassign you to AEF.  Grab your bags and speak with CPT mann up at HQ, Hopefully they decide to send you home”



“Thank you sir”



I picked up my bags and left Col Stutz’s offices. Walking out onto a primitive road in the meuse argonne forest I smelled this putrid scent, coming from the east. Even the bloated dead cows in the field back home in Colorado didn't give off this stench. It smelled like sulfur imbued with notes of rotten acorns. Waves of trucks and Mark IV tanks passed by, with soldiers hunched over in the back. They were heading west. I paused for a moment and wondered if I had made a mistake of not following them.  Unwittingly my legs moved east towards 1st army HQ.  



The smell grew stronger now, the putrid stench of corpses and chemical weapons blighted the fields.  I walked along the tree-line careful to not get caught on any barbed wire, passing bodies stacked chest high. They were smoldering, their uniforms melted into their skin until I couldn't tell where their clothes started and their bodies began. “Jesus” I exclaimed as I began to feel my stomach retch. At that moment I saw a white dove a couple yards in front of me pecking and pulling at a hunk of flesh that looked like rotted minced meat. 



I arrived at HQ and after asking around for directions, I found myself at CPT Mann’s tent unsure if the proper protocol was to knock. I mean I can’t really knock right? It's a canvas tent. I opted to smack the flap and blurted out “Lieutenant Morning here to report to CPT Mann” from inside the faded tent I heard “enter”.





Walking inside there was a wooden cot, a small work tool chest with papers strewn all over it, and a slated crate, upon which CPT Mann sat with a type writer. “DING!”, the type writer sounded off, which queued Captain Mann to look up at me. 



I tried to stand at attention but my head craned sideways on the roof of the tent, I hunched back over. “Sir, I am to be reassigned to the AEF, I’ve come to report”



“Ah, well….orders for the contingent to occupy Westphalia have already been assigned. To update that manning roster with another officer would require me to resubmit to the general and I’d rather not, It’d be easier for me to actually put you under an attache”.



“Well sir I’d actually like to go with the AEF to westphalia, you see i just got here and was hoping to…”



He wasn't listening, he pressed a new piece of paper into the rollers of the typewriter. The machine clacked faster than the ink could dry. Before I could attempt to regain his attention he pushed the carriage home, rolled out the new orders, and shoved it into my hands.



“Hermannstadt? Wallachia? What the fuck?”  I scrunched my eyes and craned my neck forward at my new assignment. I was sure what I was reading must have been a mistake. Inquisitively I asked “Why on earth would they want to send an American to the Carpathians?”



“Well, as you know the great wars have grown and shrunk borders.The kingdom of Transylvania is already accustomed to this crap.” he starts to wipe off his desk of crumbs only occasionally looking back at me to see im still somewhat paying attention. “Look Hal im not gonna bore you with the history. Just know the days of kings are over, if you ask me that's what this whole war was about. Your job is to make sure that the town of Hermannstadt safely goes into the hands of the Romanians, a job that's easier said than done.”



To be honest I hadn't considered what this war was about, I'm not here for a purpose I suppose, I just didn't want to be the only one without a story to tell of the great war. I wondered for a moment what my role was, if I really am needed. “The armistice is signed, why would this job be easier said than done?”



He starts digging into his footlocker, frantically looking for something. I try to pry around his shoulder to see what paper he could possibly produce to explain why this job is going to be more difficult than I had initially thought. 



“Ah! Here it is!” as he pulls out a tin of tuna.  He pierces the tin with his knife and sucks the juice from the lid. “Mm” he mutters as he starts sucking his lips, the tuna dripping over his half shaven gritty face. He once again raises his knife to the lid and pries it open in the most unorganized way. All I could think was that my future was in this man's hand.



“Well.. As I had said there are many claims to that god forsaken land, The austrians, hungarians, romanians, and most importantly the saxons.”  



“The saxons?” I said, “Like anglo-saxons?”



“No, Transylvanian saxons, they settled the lands in the cities and marshes, knowing they could farm the lands those gypsies couldn't. The Saxons are, as you could understand lieutenant, sympathetic to the Germans and their occupation of the carpathians”



Once again I found myself disappointed by the strings fate has woven me. Relegation to side projects seemed beneath my constitution. I grasped my orders and looked up in understanding of my task, I knew there was no point in arguing this time. 



CPT Mann looked up at me, “I understand this is disappointing for you. But you and I find ourselves in a similar situation. I have spent this war hunkered over my desk at the beck and call of administration. I will be joining you in the mission to the carpathians. Hermannstadt will be the linchpin to the joint consolidation of Romania. And you are the sole custodian of its formation. I’ll be giving you a platoon, consisting of no more than 25 men”.



—“25 Men!? How do you expect me t-“



“25 men is more than sufficient for a PEACE keeping mission lieutenant morning, now as I was saying, we will begin our preparations and move out via a train. You and I will see to it that we make all necessary preparations for the upcoming journey and eventual success of this mission”. 



The next week consisted of preparations. A wireless radio was given to my platoon, and with it a radio operator from the communications branch of the army. He would train me in the use and logistics of this system. I learned the basics of Morse code in order to communicate properly over the telegraph. 



I also met with my assistant platoon leader, a sergeant by the name of Jack O’toole, when I arrived at the mess hall. He was a large man with a knotted and mangled Glasgow scar running across his left cheek. He had worn leathery pock marked skin, sand swept hair and light hazel eyes. A handsome fella in his own right with the rugged looks of a Coloradan outdoorsman. Upon my first sight he had a group of men surrounding him, preaching fieldcraft to his soldiers like a priest waxes poetically in sermon. His men were transfixed on every word as if a spell had been cast over them. A natural born leader, or a leader born from the battlefield, I have not yet surmised. Once he finished his sermon I pulled him aside. 



We went over the plan for transit to Hermannstadt. He quietly absorbed every word of my direction via train routes. He was smart, intuitive, forthright in his words, and he understood my intent before the thought left my lips, ready to make the preparations needed. I could not have asked for a better platoon sergeant. I smiled at him, but he continued in his stoic expression. Possibly because of his Glasgow smile he never felt the need to smile from his lips. 



Finally after a week of preparations we were ready to disembark for the carpathians, for the mission that awaited. 



After 4 days of travel we arrived at the footsteps of Hermannstadt. I had gotten to know my platoon better in that time. O’Toole was a kind man who imparted his wisdom on anyone willing to hear it. I find myself bewildered at his stature, he could not be more than 21 years of age but still he commands a solemn and deep respect. With every sentence he flushes a parable from his experience either as a soldier or a field hand in Michigan. I can't help but feel like he was robbed of his youth by those who had appointed him to his position in the great war, and I oftentimes wondered what he would be like if he had stayed in Michigan to take care of his younger brothers.



I also had many conversations with my two squad leaders. Corporal Pike was a firm and loud mouthed brigand. If there ever were something to say you could be damned sure Pike would be the first to make his thoughts known.  His preferred form of communication was harsh unabridged honesty laced with the horns of satyrism. If CPL Pike was an honest devil then CPL Bush was a stoic philosopher.  We’re all certain CPL Bush grew up as a quaker due to the silent way he skulks between the formation whispering the movements of the day as the spirit beckons. 



The train hisses to a halt and my platoon begins their tasks of unloading our gear. I walk across the platform and see a strange woman, with silhouetted black hair that laid curled across her collar bones like an upturned set of ram’s horns. Skin nearly translucent I could make out blue veins creeping along her chest under a soft complexion. She had powerful green eyes, rounded mouth, and upturned nose atop a face that looked like it belonged carved into stone in a gallery of fine arts.  I stared for an inappropriate amount of time, too short to appreciate her beauty yet too long to remain respectful. She waved, beckoning me over.



“Good evening, Herr Morning, I am Lucia, the translator for you and company during your occupation of Hermanstaddt” Her voice was kind and inquisitive. 





“Oh well we're not really here to occupy this country, It’s more like a post-conflict transfer of power I suppose”  My voice kind of trembled off, as if my lungs ran out of air deeming the rest of my sentence too dull to draw another breath.



“I can tell you’re quick with the tongue. Politics should be easy for you.” Even as she cuts me with an insult the words do not sound calloused. Her thick vaguely eastern european/german accent was altogether too charming. “Not to worry, I’ll be doing the most of the talking and I’ll make sure you sound…presentable.”



“Yes well…While those words bring me some relief I’m sure we will be up to the challenge of diplomatic relations” a voice from the platform cut me off. 



–”These GOD-DAMNED CARTS, a year man! We’ve been stacking bodies on these fucking carts for a year and they always break like this! With no replacements and no tools to fix them! Now were in bram stokers nightmare in the middle of winter fiddle fucking around with these damned things..” CPL Pike’s voice trails off in the distance as he runs to the other side of the platform.





She regarded me with the steady, unblinking patience of an owl studying a field mouse in the open. In that brief, wordless moment, we understood one another.



I hear shouting from CPT Mann behind me. “Lt Hal Morning!” He yells finally catching my attention away from Lucia. “We’re in the thick of it now aren't we? Listen. I’ll be headed off to the next stop in kruhnen.  Settle your men near St. Michaels and get your telegraph set up, we’ll make contact tomorrow morning around 0900.” 



We hug goodbye and begin stretching our legs to our makeshift headquarters to the south of the city.  We round the corner of the pine curtain and see a prudent looking castle sitting atop a hill. There were no adornments, banners, or markings of any kind. Just a simple stone castle gleaming the city to the north. 



“St. Michaels..” mutters Lucia. I lean in forward pressing my curiosity. “A church? Why would a church need to be fortified in such a way? It’s got walls, ramparts, slits” 



“But you must know,” Lucia whispered. “This land and its souls have been contested for much longer than you can imagine.”



I replied, “Like the crusades? I read on my way over here that the ottoman empire did not reach this part of the carpathians until the 16th century, this castle looks much older, it looks positively medieval, 8th or 9th century at most”. Lucia stayed in her demeanor. 



“You might know history, you might know buildings, but that does not mean you know this city”  



–”Im sorry Lucia I just”



Lucia interrupted “I’m sure you see just a normal European city but I must warn you that we are used to strange faces telling us who owns these mountains. You are correct in that the church moved on these lands centuries ago, St. Michaels is like a rock bearing against waves of the ocean, slowly being eroded away.” 



“So you are the waves?” I asked



“No Herr Morning.” Lucia side-eyed me from beneath the curtains of her hair, “we pay the price, the same as any church or invader.”



I did not dare continue this conversation, I fear I have made one too many waves in this conversation already. Though the curiosity of just what the hell she means by all that is gnawing at my tongue.  I find myself replaying her words in my mind on our short approach up to the church,  I look at the clouded moonswept mountains in the distance. As a coloradan I am plenty used to mountains but these ones are entirely different. They curl across the landscape like a great wreath surrounding the city. I begin to feel insignificant as their roots poetically drag my eyes across its many faces. We begin our preparations at the foot of the hill leading up to saint michaels.  



I begin to give billeting orders to the men, making sure to give Private Halsin orders to set up the radio in my shack so I can receive contact at 9:00am sharp. I settle into bed, as the day's events race in my mind I finally drift off to sleep. 



CLICK…..BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP…BEEEEEEEP.  I begin to wake up, expecting light but only seeing the moon shine through the window. On the table in the front of the room I see the radio begin its transmission.  Click BEEP BEEP click click BEEEEP. It sounds distorted like it's low on power. I try to get up to receive the transmission but I can't move. The beeps are getting longer, stretched across the wire burning itself into the frequency as my ears begin to resonate against the bouncing harmonics. I feel like a singing bowl being scraped past the point of fluidity. My eyeballs burn from the sensation.



From the corner of my room a face seemingly appears from the curtain of shadow. Its skin is porcelain, fitted onto its thin face like a geisha’s mask.  It’s positively smooth with no pores, blemishes, or detail, like the first pass of an oiled painting. I rub my eyes to adjust my focus onto the figure. But my eyesight never fully returns, I look into the corner and just see a static grey. My tongue folds into my mouth and wriggles in the back of my throat like a fresh caught eel in a net. My body begins to feel shallow as fear slowly overcomes my still body. 



I suddenly wake up, the day light pushes its way into my room, with no sign of the monster that was once there. I immediately slap my hands onto my inner thigh. Relieved that somehow I had managed to fight off this nightmare without pissing myself. 



“Sweet Mary, mother of Joseph"". I crash back onto the firm mattress. Rubbing my hands across my face I feel a faint sense of moisture perspiring from my face. A nightmare to be sure but an extremely vivid one. Unfurling the sheets the chill from my fallow residence seeps into my bed. I inhale sharply as I press my feet upon the icy wooden floor of my shack. 



Walking out onto the front steps, the air was stolen from my lungs and whisked off into the frigid morning air.

I wandered over to the camp my soldiers had begun to settle into, I'm always amazed at what soldiers can do with a barren patch of land in so little time.  There was a fire blazing in the center of 8 large and medium sized tents.  These tents have been dug into the field just outside the walls of saint michaels. The sides of the canvas had been fortified with logs and moss for insulation against the cold winter winds that howl through the night. 

Inside the tents they managed to scrounge together carpets that laid flat against the dirt, stoves to keep the tents warm, and cots that were fashioned into bunk beds. I suspected that Sergeant O'toole had a hand in these plans, he is after-all the fieldcraft expert. 

Stepping down into the carved out pit they all stood up. ""There's no need for that gentlemen, as you were"". One of the soldiers dragged a stool near me and asked, ""Are you joining us for breakfast sir?” I pulled the stool between my legs and mounted the cold ply wood close to the fire. ""I might as well, this smells better than the hard tack I got left over...where did you manage to get these eggs anyways?"" SGT O’Toole piped up “We bought them when we stopped in Vienna because” –

Suddenly the entire camp repeated the same phrase “Always stock up on supplies when you can!”



Sergeant O’toole rolled his eyes “Correct! I'm glad you’ve all been listening! You all should be glad we did because this town seems to be short on chickens. I'd guess it’s the wolves, they were making a hell of a noise last night.”

they went back to their earlier discussion. ""I'm telling you we need to move the camp SGT"" CPL Bush said. CPL Pike chortled while mixing his eggs. ""What? ya 'fraid a skeleton's gonna come up from the ground and pluck your pretty little eyes out?"". The gang began to stir with their opinions on the matter, timidly talking about the skeleton.  

I had been completely lost so I figured I'd ask ""A skeleton you say? where'd you find it?"". CPL Pike between stabbing motions of his eggs pointed back to his tent with the handle of his fork. There lay a skull on top of his chest. ""I'm calling him PVT Hamlet, he's watchin’ my treasure"". SGT O'toole rose to the occasion and replied ""I'm shocked you call your shit stained undies treasure, I'm even more shocked you know Hamlet"". The camp roared with laughter, even I couldn't hold back a smile. 

O'Toole looked up from his breakfast, confidently taking a swig of his coffee and began to speak again before any one else could seize the moment of conversation ""this is an old potter's field Pike, we have to be respectful"". CPL Pike visibly confused began to open his mouth, O'Toole once again interjected ""A potters field for anyone unaware is a mass burial site originating from the new testament. Somethin about priests buying a field with the 30 pieces of silver judas gave them before he committed suicide. These fields are more common than ya think.""

The mood sharply turned serious. the quaker CPL Bush looked down at his feet and muttered a bible verse. "" 'It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.' And after they had consulted together, they bought with them the potter's field, to be a burying place for strangers. For this the field was called Aceldama, that is, the field of blood, even to this day"". A sallow tint washed across the faces of all my soldiers. eyes began to well with water like a wine cup filled to the brim but not yet overflowing. I can tell these men are lost in the events of the war. 

I've had the misfortune of seeing piles of bodies littering the fields of the forest, many of those soldiers are unrecognizable as humans let alone individuals. There will be no way for their deeds to be written down in the glory of the great war. 

Their identities are completely ripped from the corpse they are now. In a way it's the most heroic death, many of them sacrificed themselves knowing their names would slip into a void of the eternal subconscious.  I feel a pinch of shame for thinking like this, saddened I was not there in the battles these boys fought. I feel like I had somehow failed them, but I also wondered if I would have been amongst the nameless corpses.

""Alright boys lets get this camp moved"" the raspy groans bellowed back at O'Tooles command like children being told to wash before supper.  I began to walk back to my shack in order to make first contact with CPT Mann.  

The cold seized me the moment I stepped out of the warm pit, my boots crunching over the frozen earth as I made my way uphill toward my new shelter. My thoughts drifted, almost hypnotically, to the boys and everything they had endured. They were so accustomed to death that skeletons, guts, even shattered skulls drew laughter. Yet the instant the talk turned to graves, or the quiet weight of remembering the dead, the mirth drained from them. The contrast lingered with me, unsettling and unresolved.

By the time I surfaced from those thoughts, my feet were already brushing against the shack’s crooked doorstep. 

My pocket watch was about to strike 9 so I choreographed a message to be sent out, practicing my hand strokes until I felt I got the timing right. The message would read ""We set camp at church, will talk with translator today""

I was dreadfully slow at this, I felt like I got a hang of it in Germany but compared to the pros I was barely even an amateur.  I would let PVT Pint do this but I believe a commander should write his own messages, and I'm sure I'll get better....hopefully.  

My pen and paper were at the ready to transcribe the incoming message which shortly followed ""I Will come meet you on sunday, good luck.""  With my first official report via radio handled I went about the business of doing my own version of setting up camp before Lucia arrived.  

I cleared out the cobwebs, tidied up my chest, and began to sweep out the stove. The stove pipe was too clogged for a fire last night, if i had attempted to use it the ashes and soot would have clouded this whole room in a fine black powder. I should have gotten to work on this before I fell asleep since the room was deadly cold last night. 

I was fastly running out of time, Lucia would be here any moment and I still needed to chop wood for the night. I looked around and saw the place was still a bit of a stye, in the back of my head i couldn't help but to be embarrassed if Lucia saw my shack in this state. 

Time had run out though, I heard Lucia calling from the circular stone walls that surrounded my Head Quarters.

Lucia was wearing something more traditional for Romania today, a blouse with a sort of intricately patterned apron around a long skirt that baffled past her knees, a large woolen padded coat, and a cotton hood around her black hair that highlighted her bright green eyes and soft features. She was absolutely stunning. I wanted to compliment her but I couldn't, it wouldn't be right to compliment a lady who works for me, no matter how stunning she is.

""Good morning Herr morning"" a joke i had heard a thousand times back home especially at school from the other kids. In this instance it took on a different tone, she was teasing me, and god help me I liked it. 

""ha...ha"" I replied, looking her dead in the face. I didn't have a comeback, I'm not as experienced in teasing as SGT O'Toole, maybe i should ask him to teach me how. 

I spoke again, ""I figured we start in hermannstadt today"" Lucia nodded in agreement. I grabbed my holster for the Colt 1911 and my woolen jacket I strode out into the yard and onto the horse CPT Mann left me. 

As soon as I reached out to Lucia to pull her onto the horse she swatted away my hand and hopped up behind the saddle. I didn't say anything as she wrapped her arms around my stomach and pressed her face into my back. The warmth was a new but strangely familiar feeling. As the horse began its slow trot to town CPL Pike and PVT Halsin noticed us riding in their direction. As soon as I passed them I could hear whistling, hootin, and all manner of hollering. God those boys piss me off sometimes but I can't help but to love them. They won't love me so much when I come back and let 'em know they just volunteered themselves for latrine duties. 

The road winded into town, the buildings grew denser, the streets began to fill with people going about their business. Lucia and I were deep in conversation, she wanted to know all about life back home. ""It's terribly boring. I promise you, my dad and mom owned a number of businesses in town. They moved to CO a few years before I was born in order to take advantage of all the wealth from the mining industry. The wealth eventually found them and I grew up in a big house with 6 older brothers"". 

Lucia wriggled in the back.  ""My lord, the Mornings have a big family, I can't imagine what it's like to grow up with 6 older brothers, It must have been wonderful"". 

""That's not the half of it. My father also had 6 older brothers and one younger sister.  I guess its a curse of the family to have 7 sons until you get a daughter. My mom was worn out by the time I came along though"". Lucia jerked in the back, her head separated from my shoulders and I could feel her staring through me. ""seventh child of a seventh child, this explains a lot about you"".  

""like what? that I'm cursed with younger brother syndrome"". The horse beckoned towards the city center.

""No Herr Morning, in Dacia this is an omen, you are meant to have a meaningful life, whether this is a curse or a blessing is up to you"" She pointed to the big church in the plaza ""this will be our first stop"" the horse began to veer towards the building almost by instinct. We stopped near the doors to the church and I swung my leg over the front leaping on to the cobblestones. As I went to grab the reins, Lucia pulled my body close to her, and pushed off my shoulders to ease herself down onto the ground. 

""I thought you didn't want help on or off the horse"". Lucia fixed her hair and patted down her skirt, ""pfft if i want help I'll make it clear i want help, I'm not Cinderella and you are not prince charming, the only one of us that resembles a fairy tale is your noble steed"" She patted the face of the horse, smiling into his big eyes. ""He is quite a good horse isn't he? I've been wrestling with what to call him"".  

Lucia began to walk towards the big oak doors of the cathedral while I was still yammering on ""maybe chestnut? it matches his fur."" Lucia let out a groan, ""too predictable"". I thought for a moment and quickly replied, ""Bullseye, that's a proper name for a horse where I'm from"" she just shaked her head.  ""Lucia is a good name"", she stopped in her tracks and fear crept up my spine. I didn't mean any harm by it. I was just trying my hand at teasing but it's too late now. She turned back at me ""oh so you want to ride me huh?"" she grasped her hips and beckoned them. 

I began to stammer like a half wit desperately clawing back my words when she yelped and smacked her ass laughing incredulously at me. ""torturing you is easy, it takes the fun out of it"".  She composed herself as she walked into the church.

We entered the precipice of the cathedral, a glamorous white stoned structure with gold trimmings adorning the artifices. The pews lined the great hall filtering the pillars that rose gently towards the pulpit. To the side was a shallow enclave with red candles facing a great stone sarcophagus, with a priest praying before it. The hobnails on my boots clanked against the granite beneath my feet as I paced towards the priest with Lucia to my side. We pensively waited for him for a moment before he signed the cross, finishing his prayer.  



“Apologies, I seem to have lost track of time” He broke the silence with a thick brogueish accent. I was never a devoutly religious man, at this point I scarcely imagine I could even call myself a believer. “Prayers always seemed to be a bit one sided for me father” I replied half heartedly, mostly because I wanted to make it clear I was here on business not for conversion. 



“Ah! A non-believer I see!” he said almost gleefully “It’s quite alright my boy, you are correct, the conversations most of us have with god are indeed one sided”. He was a tall man, nearly my height, but he was thin, almost delicate looking. He had brown and grey haired sideburns wrapping all the way to his chin. 

“That’s what I love about god my dear boy. His silence is what makes him god is it not?”  I shot him an inquisitive look, He smiled at me, moving tapestries from one end of the church to the other, finally replying “oh please, I’m realistic as well as an idealist. God is one of the few influences in our lives who never requires a price for his love. You are given his salvation from the very moment you sprout your little wings and fly from your mothers womb. None of this is for him, it's for you and all other living beings to give a peaceful place to receive his grace. Nothing more, nothing less, you are as welcome here as any Pope” 

He gestures silently to the cathedral that I must admit is quite serene. “I suppose I don't meet many of your type, most of the religious folks I’ve met in Colorado have been god-fearin’. They would pounce at the opportunity to judge passerbys from high atop their milk crates on a crowded sidewalk downtown”.  

He finally moved the last tapestry and sat on the pew ushering us to sit beside him. “I have had the misfortune of meeting many like that myself, even from my own congregation. I don't believe God favors those who preach in such a manner.”

I paused for a moment peering at the cross behind him. Jesus slouched against the nails driven into his hands with blood trickling from the wound left by a spear. 

He looked behind me “It’s an interesting sigil for Christianity isn't it? Our savior being betrayed, tortured, and murdered. His fearful expression scared me as a boy I admit. The bones of the saints and the holy sacraments seemed positively medieval to me. For a long time I believed these were just shocking images used by the church as a bit of an advertisement"" 

He said advertisement weird. Ad-vert-is-ment. British people sure have a funny way of talking, he continued into his sermon. “It wasn't until I had already taken my vows that it had dawned on me. It represents the sacrifice, a promise God made to the people of the world paid by the blood of his only son. We choose it as a reliquary to never forget our place in that contract. Though i think the meaning has been lost over the 2 millenniums”. 



“You said you don't like people on the milk crates spreading the word of god, forgive me but is that not dissimilar to the catholic church?”. The priest chuckled “I appreciate your candidness Left-tenant morning. You are absolutely correct in some cases. The men who choose to use god’s name to further their own ideas of morality and status are taking the lord's name in vain, that is, using the name of god for your own vanity in hopes to elevate yourself, not the lord”.  I’d been taken aback, not just by the silly way he pronounced lieutenant, but also by the fact he knew my rank and title. “Your father, how did you know who I was?”



“You are here to shepherd this town through a tumultuous time in its history, your name has become known to me because I am known to the people”.  I had looked at Lucia who had been quiet all this time and she simply shrugged back at me. Lucia peered from over my lap and took the opportunity to get the conversation back on track, hoping to save me from salvation no doubt. “Father Simon, speaking of the people” she said in almost a whisper. “My little white dove here would like to know how he can help rebuild this city under new Romanian leadership”.



Father Simon straightened his stole around his shoulders. Pulling himself together as a representative of the church.  “Ah, pardon me Lucia for straying off topic. Hermannstadt is facing a number of concerns, and we have far too few resources to address them after sending a quarter of our young men off to war”.



He pushed himself off the mahogany pew and shuffled to the pulpit grabbing a piece of paper and a pair of crescent moon shaped glasses. “Food for the winter is our main worry, we had to give up most of our stores for the war effort. There has also been some growing violence amongst the Saxons returning home from the war, particularly against those who deserted or did not wish to fight”. 



Lucia began to discuss the town's logistical needs with father Simon, making a short list of supplies we’d need to request from the newly appointed Romanian government. I wasn’t sure yet how responsive the new government would be to supplying the city, or even if they could. Politics in any country, especially a new one, could be incredibly hard to navigate. I’d need Lucia’s help drafting a memo that I could send through my chain of command.  In the meantime I’ll see if we can scrounge any extra classes of supply from the US army’s logistics branch.



As for the tension between the saxon’s and the deserters I will have to put it on the back burner. I wish I could do something but I can’t just punish people for their feelings. Though I steadied myself for the real possibility we will need to play sheriff in order to keep the peace. 

Once we had finished with the work we came for, Father Simon gained our attention once more “I'm sorry Lucia but I thought you’d ought to know in case you feel you can be of any help, one of my Parishioners, Mrs. Coman, has a worrying case of a missing child. Her 10 year old son left one morning and never returned”.



Lucia nodded. “Herr Morning, I believe this would be a good task for you and your men, finding a child of Hermannstadt may help you gain the trust of its people. Besides, I'm sure Constantin has just wandered off, as he does from time to time.” 

She was right. I am an outsider here and I know the people of Hermannstadt rightfully associate myself and my men with the war that took so much from them. I nodded, and said my goodbyes to Father Simon.",5,1763313162.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1oyr5m7,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1oyr5m7/alienated_alone_and_not_sure_how_to_help_myself/,"Alienated, Alone, and Not Sure How to Help Myself","I’m out running errands, but I just sat in a parking garage for an hour typing this out because I’m feeling overwhelmed and need to get this off my chest:

I just feel like I’m getting worse and losing my life to mental illness. I’m 24 now, but I’ve dealt with mental health issues as far back as late middle school. I started seriously addressing these issues about 2 years ago when I finally had access to healthcare. Currently diagnosed with ADHD, ASD, depression, and anxiety, and although the latter 2 have definitely improved a lot since I started medication. I’ve also seen multiple therapists, the longest I saw for 7 months. However, I feel like I’m always completely exhausted, doing everything completely by myself, all while I watch my work suffer, my relationships deteriorate and disappear, and I struggle more and more to take care of myself. I feel like I’m succeeding in holding off the worst of my mental health issues from crushing me completely, but I’m gradually losing the battle just trying to manage everything. While I used to feel a constant panic of fixing myself, I’m not sure if I actually improved or if I just got used to it and became numb.

At its core, I suspect that the overwhelming amount of mental issues I deal with are a direct result of not having a support system of family/friends to rely on and working a cognitively demanding job with long hours - the reason I’m still there is because it pays great, has great benefits/insurance and allows me to actually get the medical care I need without plunging myself into generational debt. And yes, I do hate it sooooo much and I’ve been looking for alternatives, but with the current job market everything pays so much less and doesn’t even seem to have a good work environment. I’d love to leave my career entirely and pursue something else, but I feel trapped just taking care of my health. 

I’m worried that at this rate, I’m inevitably going to lose my footing and I’m going to lose everything and all the work I’ve put in will be meaningless. I feel horribly alone/alienated (probably the biggest contributor to worsening health), and I feel like if I fall there will be nobody there to catch me. Furthermore, sometimes I question whether I might have other conditions/disorders that I haven’t been diagnosed with, but considering the frequency that psychs will diagnose identical symptoms as totally different diagnoses, I’m afraid to become one of those people with a dozen diagnoses, 20 medications tried, and not seeing any improvement. 

I’m just scared. There’s no safety net, I’m not enjoying life, and I feel like the past 2 years, despite all my efforts, have just been me trying to helplessly claw my way out of a hole. And honestly, I feel like just having a community of people who cared about me and I could move in with or rely on for a while while I work on fixing myself would be exactly what I need - but that’s not in the stars for me. 

For example, today it took me 3 HOURS to get ready to leave the house to go grab coffee - not because I was doing anything, but just pure distraction, inability to focus on anything, just wandering around my apartment doing random stuff for absolutely no reason. I don’t understand it and I wish I had the energy to fight it, but I just feel so exhausted and barely have the energy to do the bare minimum. 

Does anyone have ANY ideas of what I can do? I’m really just at a loss for where to go from here.

Automatic (I have a Datsun Z with a 5 speed, so the whole small car, shifting, raw driving experienced is covered).
103k on the clock
Body is in decent shape, couple dings here and there...not bad for 35 years old and living in SoCal.

Doctor said that the cause was unknown exactly. May be from stress (which made some sense because I was starting a business and leaving my last employer on slightly acrimonious terms), and may be infuenced by genetics, lifestyle, etc. Doctor recommended cutting coffee, alcohol, stress if possible.

 Since then I've reduced alcohol dramatically, changed coffee for green tea, started exercising regularly, reduced stress as much as possible.

1oyqzlg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oyqzlg,Momotaro #001 type 1 standard denim jacket,"TLDR: I got a new denim jacket from Momotaro, the #001 Standard Type 1 jacket in Tokuno blue and really like it. Lovely fabric and silhouette. Denim has become weirdly personal for me and I wrote an essay about it in case anyone is interested)



Hi again. Some of you might remember me from a few years ago, when I wrote about accidentally spilling coffee on a Buzz Rickson jacket and discovering that raw denim people care very deeply about their clothes. At the time I had just bought my first Momotaro denim dress and I felt like I had unlocked a secret world.

A lot has changed since then. I have had another child. And I am pregnant again (early days). I have spent the last years in a strange loop of body changes. Dressing is mostly about what fits and what is easy to wash. My wardrobe slowly turned into stretch fabrics, soft elastic waistbands, and anything that promised “comfort.” I am grateful for those clothes, but I stopped feeling like myself in them, it’s all so disposable. That is a point that I really want to hammer home here, there aren’t many great options for this period of life: cheaply made clothing that falls apart instead of aging gracefully.

A few weeks ago, my partner surprised me with a Momotaro Jacket in a size small. I almost laughed when I saw the size because every jacket I own from Japanese brands is a Large. Buying anything labeled Small after two pregnancies feels surreal . But the fit is perfect. The arms are roomy, the body is boxy, the silhouette is relaxed without swallowing me. It looks intentional. It feels like I am wearing something that was made to last, not something temporary to survive another trimester. The jacket is fairly stiff right now but I know it will soften up a lot and, more importantly, thanks to the cinch at the back, I will be able to adjust the fit depending on whatever shape my body is (different trimesters, postpartum etc.). Teh jacket feels both rugged and somehow refined at the same time and I’ve worn it with a lot of different things. Very versatile but I would advise to combine it with darker colours at the beginning, which suits me to the ground because I try to wear things that can sustain an attack of chocolate covered fingers. 

I took it to the park with the kids this morning and when I looked at myself in the reflection of a shop window on the way, I just felt good. Not “mum in survival mode” or “this is all that fits right now.” The fabric has this incredible sheen and depth to it that is just mesmerising. There is something to be said about how clothing makes us feel, I guess. 

Whenever I didn’t feel like a whale in the last couple of years, I have tried a few other Japanese brands, but nothing felt like Momotaro. There is something about their denim that makes me feel grounded and weirdly protected, bit like wearing armour. The fabric has structure without being rigid, the softness and feeling on the skin is really surprising given how substantial the denim feels.

And emotionally, Momotaro represents something for me that other brands do not. I bought my first pieces when I was discovering slower fashion. I wore my first momotaro dress when I picked up the pregnancy test for my second child, to a job interview, and to my first day at the job. 

Now, I am wearing this jacket as I go through another season of change and I am quite excited about the memories I will make in this one. This is, at the end of the day, just a denim jacket, and really great one at that, but it’s also so much more to me.

So again, can't stress enough how happy I am that I met one your tribe a few years ago. You guys are class, just wanted to say that

Case #006 ""Night Shift at the compound""","The compound isn’t really a compound; that’s just what we call these branches of the organisation. From the outside, it looks like a regular office building, but once you step inside, it becomes clear it’s anything but.

Each compound follows the same layout.

The first floor is for research offices, where I spend most of my time.

The second floor belongs to the hunters, gyms, training rooms, and a handful of desks.

The third floor is for research testing: lots of lab coats and very little fun.

Then there are the underground levels.

Floor A holds the archives.

Floor B, the vault, stores cursed or otherwise preternatural objects.

Floor C, Containment, houses anything or anyone considered dangerous to society, our realm, or reality itself.

No matter which branch you’re assigned to, stepping into the elevator from the lobby always takes you to one of these floors. I’m not convinced they even exist in our universe anymore; that’s just a theory, though. There are no windows down there, and no one I know has clearance to access anything above or below the floors we use. At least the elevator reliably drops you at the right place.

Lily and I pressed the button for the first floor, and a moment later the doors opened into a large room filled with desks. The blue lighting and white furniture do nothing for the mood, but after long enough, you stop noticing it.

“You get Broussard and meet me in one of the conference rooms,” I said before stepping out of the elevator.

“Alright, but you owe me a coffee. I hate the locker room.” Lily shuddered jokingly. The locker room is what she calls the second floor, which isn’t horribly inaccurate.

I walked over to the small kitchenette closest to my cubicle, which is thankfully near a set of conference rooms. I don’t envy the people who have to walk more than a few minutes to get to their desk, but I guess I never really see them.

“Hey, Aarna,” I said while passing a woman wearing far too many jumpers. Aarna Chopra had been my cubicle neighbour for the past few months. She’s nice and very talkative, something I can’t relate to but I like her. It’s good having a friend actually in my branch of the organisation.

“WHAT?” she yelped as I walked past her toward the coffee machine.

“Oh, Elijah, it’s just you. You’re way too quiet; I need to get you a bell or something,” she said playfully, though still breathing heavily from the fright.

“Not really a bell person. Do you want a coffee? I’m brewing a few,” I asked.

“Ooo, yes please. Who are the other ones for?” she asked with a smile. She leaned back on the counter, fiddling with something in her hand that I couldn’t see.

“Lily and Richard B are having a secret meeting about an entity that may or may not want to kill me,” I said casually.

“Oh,” she said nervously. “Can I join?”



A few minutes later, Richard and Lily entered the small conference room I’d claimed. Aarna sat at the table, using the sleeves of her yellow jumper to hold her coffee cup.

“Yo, Aaron, welcome to the secret club,” Richard said confidently.

“My name is actually Aarna,” she corrected. He cursed under his breath and tried again.

“Shit, sorry, chère. Well, I welcome you to the team, Aarna; the more the merrier,” he said with a large, genuine smile before taking his seat. Lily didn’t say anything but gave me an odd smile when she sat down.

Once everyone was settled, I went over the story of what happened when I was a child, Stalborn, the disappearing kids, Imani, and how he told me William Grey was free, though admittedly in a less emotionally vulnerable way.

After I finished, they sat in silence for a few minutes. I expected questions, not silence.

“So,” I started awkwardly, “what are we all thinking?”

“It’s just a lot to take in, Elijah,” Aarna said, and I saw Richard nodding.

“I’m sorry if this is rude to ask, but… why didn’t it kill you when you were in the car? No one was around, and you didn’t have any protection,” Aarna continued.

My stomach tightened, and blood rushed to my head.

“It is a creature of habit and routine; it has hunting rituals, and you didn’t fit those requirements, not at that point,” Richard jumped in.

“Do you want my advice, or do you want my expert opinion?” he asked before taking a sip of coffee.

I hadn’t even thought about that. I’d been trying to figure out what William Grey was without consulting an actual hunter.

“Well, you are the hunter here. Have you ever hunted something like this?” Lily asked impatiently. Richard smiled.

“Nope, but I am excited to—”

The lights suddenly shut off, and everyone vanished in a wave of fog.

“Woah ho, I honestly wasn’t sure that would work, Mr. Wiltburrow. I’ve only done it a few times over the years, but goddamn am I happy it did,” a familiar husky voice said from all around me. I spun in every direction, and when I turned back toward the table, he was sitting at the end of it.

“Imani, what have you done to me?” I said, panicked and confused.

“Simple. Well, simple for me. I took your consciousness out of the realm of the living and brought you to the dream realm. Thought we should have a chat,” he said, planting both hands on the table.

“This is honestly the worst time, Imani. You’ve had the past few days to talk to me. Why now?” I asked, losing patience.

“Just thought I’d give my favourite research agent a little heads-up: the compound, this little slice of bureaucracy outside of where danger could find you, is currently under attack,” he said with a smile.

“What have you done!” I shouted, but he shook his head.

“Not from me, and not from him.” He lifted his hand and pointed at the glass doors. Standing outside was a tall, pale man, breathing heavily and smiling.

“You know his dreams aren’t particularly fun; a lot to do with you nowadays,” Imani said. William Grey’s eyes were locked on me. His desperation felt real. I wanted to believe he was just a figment of Imani’s fog, but part of me knew this was William Grey and somehow, we were in his dream.

“Anywho,” Imani said, waving Grey away as he dissolved into fog, “just thought I’d let you know that it’s almost here, and it’s looking for something powerful in that vault of yours.”

He waved his hand playfully like a cat batting at a mouse. Suddenly I shot up off the floor. The lights were on. Lily was crouched over me; Aarna was on one side, and Richard stood above them.

I’d forgotten where I was for a moment before adrenaline flushed everything back. Sweat built quickly.

“How long was I out?” I said.

“A few minutes, four or five,” Lily answered. “Elijah, are you okay?”

“No. It was Imani. He said something is coming, and it’s heading for the vault,” I said, trying and failing to stand.

“You think something can get in here?” Richard said skeptically.

The lights shifted to red, and sirens blared.

“All personnel, please evacuate to the evacuation zones on your respective floors. Please stay away from the elevator and do not confront the foreign entity. I repeat…”

“Did you guys even know they had speakers in here? Or alarms?” Richard said.

I ran for the door, but his hand grabbed my wrist. I slipped out easily, but Lily wasn’t as easy to escape. She threw her hand out, and I felt myself yanked back, slamming my tailbone against the edge of the table.

“Where do you think you’re going, Elijah?” Lily asked, almost accusatory.

I considered lying, saying I was going to the evacuation zone, but these people, Aarna, Richard, Lily, were my friends.

“The elevator. Imani warned me that something is breaking into the vault to steal something powerful,” I confessed.

“And you alone were going to stop it,” she said sarcastically. “I have so many things I want to say right now,” she added, lowering her arm. The weight lifted and I stood.

“Okay, I think I know what you want to say. Can we please talk on the way?” I urged.

“Shouldn’t we go to the evacuation zones?” Aarna asked.

“Aarna, in all the time you’ve worked here, have you ever seen an evacuation zone? Any of you? Or heard an alarm?” I asked. They all shook their heads.

“Maybe… I don’t know. It is pretty weird,” Aarna said.

“The hunters would be on the move,” Richard muttered. “Shit. Most of them are in the field. It’s only me and a handful of others.”

“We should meet up with them,” Lily said.

“We can meet them in the vault. Please we need to move,” I begged.

“I don’t know, Elijah; this all feels really weird,” Aarna said, tucking her hands into her sleeves.

“Alright, I trust you. Let’s move,” Lily said. “Aarna, no one will blame you if you go to the evacuation zone, but if Elijah thinks something’s up, then I’m going with him.”

The doors opened to the vault: a long, dark, metallic hallway. The lights were off, the air cold. Familiar somehow, but I couldn’t place it.

The vault is a large metallic maze with small enclosures for each paranormal artefact, almost like a zoo. It’s easy to get turned around.

We made our way in slowly. Richard and Lily led with camping lamps; Aarna and I followed with flashlights.

“So, what are we looking for exactly?” Richard whispered.

“I don’t know. Imani just said it was powerful,” I said.

“I don’t think I like this dream man,” Lily added.

“I can’t help but agree; I’m not a fan of him dragging me around whenever he wants,” I replied.

“You think he can be killed?” Richard asked. I didn’t get the chance to answer.

A scream rang through the vault, bouncing off metal.

Aarna squealed and fell into me. I dropped my flashlight, and it shattered.

“Oh God, I’m so sorry, Elijah—” Aarna started, but I raised my hand.

“It’s okay. Really.”

“Here, take mine. I can see pretty well in the dark,” Richard said, handing me his lamp. He pulled a large machete from his pants and swung it effortlessly.

“How long have you had that in there?” Lily asked, amused despite the situation.

“Every hunter is prepared for anything,” he replied confidently.

“Even accidental cuts on your dick?” Lily shot back.

Under any other circumstances, that would’ve earned a laugh but tonight, silence. Except for another scream.

“Everyone stay close,” Richard said, and we huddled together.

We moved forward until Richard held up a hand.

“Hold up the hallway branches.”

“Wait, that doesn’t make sense. I’ve been down here before. I thought things seemed different, but this is completely changed,” Aarna said.

“Are you sure? Can this floor change?” Lily asked.

“She’s right, Lily. I’ve been down here a few times. It’s not like this.” My heart pounded.

“We should split up,” I said.

“Are you serious? Splitting up is a horrible idea,” Aarna said.

“I know, but we can’t let whatever’s down here get what it’s looking for and since we don’t know what that is, we need to cover more ground,” I said. They stared.

“What?” I asked.

“Nothing you’ve just taken more to fieldwork than I expected,” Lily said. “Aarna, go with Richard. He’s the most likely to survive, so you’ll have pretty great odds. Elijah and I will go left, you two go right.”



“So, you know Aarna definitely has a thing for you, right?” Lily said as we walked.

“What are you talking about?” I said, genuinely surprised. She always makes small talk during tense situations, but this caught me off guard.

“Don’t act like you don’t see it. You’re dumb, but you’re the smart type of dumb.”

“Ouch,” I muttered.

Before she could continue, a screeching noise rang out ahead. Lily closed her eyes briefly, reached a hand forward, and whispered, “Oh God,” before sprinting into the dark. I followed.

What we found was something I wish I hadn’t seen.

A hunter lay on the ground her lower half missing, organs dragged along behind her upper body. Barbed wire wrapped around and pierced through her. A soft, piercing screech escaped her slightly open mouth, like a final scream looping forever.

Dear God. Her face was unrecognisable. A hook pierced her right eye, attached to a cable stretching into the dark. It was pulling her toward something. We both knew we had to stop it.

I looked away instinctively. This was the worst thing I’d ever seen. Lily took a few steps back and gagged.

“Jesus fuck,” she choked.

I forced myself to focus on anything else and saw a revolver clutched in the corpse’s hand. Likely organisation-issued silver bullets. Shielding my eyes, I unpeeled her still-warm fingers and took the weapon.

I felt suspended between overwhelming emotion and complete numbness. Ever since remembering Stalborn, death has taken on new meaning.

“Let’s keep moving,” Lily said once she steadied herself.

“Alright,” I said, holding the revolver out. I had no experience with firearms, but in a hallway, it wouldn’t matter.

We followed the metal wire deeper. Neither of us spoke.

My thoughts drifted to Aarna. Richard could handle himself, but Aarna had never done fieldwork. What had I pressured her into?

Gunshots suddenly exploded ahead. I flinched hard.

“Shit, that was ahead of us,” I said.

We ran. The hallway opened into a tall room lined with enclosures. Scaffolding climbed the right wall toward catwalks crossing multiple levels.

“We have to go up,” Lily said.

“Are you sure—”

A man wearing a hunter’s vest fell from above and hit the floor with a wet, heavy splat.

We climbed. The higher we went, the more flesh hung from above like meat in a slaughterhouse.

The smell was overwhelming. I felt myself slipping toward shock.

At the top, we saw two figures. One hunter swung an axe at another hunter except the second had jagged metal pieces jutting from his neck and face.

The axe-wielder swung hard. The other stepped aside and thrust his hand out. Metal cables burst from his wrist and forearm, digging into the axe-wielder and yanking her off the railing. As she fell, the cables wrapped around the railing, suspending her body midair.

The creature looked at us. Its eyes glowed orange like headlights through fog.

“HYAH!” Lily grunted, thrusting her hands out. Cables shot toward us from under its skin, but she flung the creature off the scaffolding.

I ran toward where it fell. My footsteps echoed like thunder. I found an enclosure with only a lectern. On it sat a pocket watch. I tried the door, it was locked. I fired at the glass. The bullet did nothing.

Of course. It was the vault. Why would the glass break?

Metallic booms erupted behind me. I turned to see large metallic arms, wires wrapped together, dig into the scaffolding. The creature was climbing back up, arms protruding from its back like broken wings.

I aimed at it, but my hands shook violently. Panic overwhelmed me. I fired once completely missing and dropped the gun.

“Lily!” I screamed. She stood on the staircase, trying to force the thing back down, but it wasn’t working. The creature aimed at her and shot a metal wire. As it neared her, it slowed. She was holding it back, but it shook violently.

“Hey dickhead!” I yelled. It turned its offhand toward me, and I ripped the cable out of its palm. I dove, but not fast enough, the cable grazed my thigh, slicing it open. Pain exploded through me.

“ELINAH!” Lily screamed. The cable she’d been holding slipped past her defence and plunged into her shoulder. She screamed and nearly went limp, dragged toward the creature.

Fear hit something deep inside me.

I crawled to the railing and pulled myself up. The creature reeled Lily closer. Suddenly, an axe spun through the air and embedded itself in the creature’s back.

It screeched a mixture of a man’s scream and an inhuman growl.

I saw Richard and Aarna on the far side. They were unharmed. Relief flooded me.

The cable slid out of Lily’s shoulder and retreated into the creature’s arm. She collapsed against the railing, unconscious.

“Don’t let it impale you!” I yelled.

“Wasn’t my plan!?” Richard shouted. He held a machete in one hand and another throwing axe in the other, both silver.

Aarna ran toward me. She knelt and looked at my torn pants, torn skin.

Without thinking, she took off her yellow jumper, revealing the green one beneath, and tied the yellow one around my wound. She put my arm around her shoulder.

“We have to move,” she said, stuttering with fear but still helping.

I tried to see Richard fighting the creature, but my vision blurred with adrenaline and pain.

Another screech. The catwalk shook. Aarna lost her footing, and we both fell onto the metal.

“Ahhh, dammit,” I groaned.

“Aarna, are you okay?” I said through clenched teeth.

“Yeah. I’m okay, Elijah,” she said, though her tone wasn’t convincing.

I looked across the catwalk and saw Richard crouched over an exhausted but conscious Lily. He held his machete in one hand and an adrenaline syringe in the other.

The creature began to rise again. Richard injected Lily, and she roared back to life.

Richard launched himself forward, stepping onto the railing before leaping. Lily thrust her arms out, psychically pushing him harder toward the creature.

Richard flew into the creature’s upper body. He angled his machete so it drove straight into its skull and down its spine.

The creature spun violently, its eyes flickering with light before returning to a normal human colour.

Then it went still.

Richard tumbled onto the catwalk as the creature fell off the railing, crashing to the floor below.

A few hours later, a large squad of hunters arrived and locked down the area. We were separated and underwent individual tests.

Lily spent the most time in isolation; the higher-ups heard she’d been pierced by the cable. She was the only survivor of that specific injury, so they needed to ensure she wasn’t infected like the hunter the creature took over.

“I don’t think I want to do fieldwork,” Aarna said with a nervous chuckle.

Aarna and I talked in my cubicle like normal. I sat at my desk while she leaned against the wall.

“Trust me, most of the time it’s chasing myths that are just that. This was… something else,” I said while drinking coffee.

She smiled at me. I smiled back. Aarna was a good person.

“I’ll be back in just a minute,” I said, getting up and heading to the bathroom. As I washed my hands, the water shifted—not in temperature, but texture. Something about it felt wrong. Superficial.

I looked at my reflection. Black fog lingered around the bathroom.

“Imani, are you serious? Can’t I even piss in peace?” I snapped.

Why should I expect anything else from him? He respects no timing, so why would he respect the ancient law of the bathroom: do not disturb?

A toilet flushed, and a stall door opened. Imani walked out in a fine suit. He strode casually to the sink beside me and washed his hands.

“My, my, Elijah, you have outdone yourself; you stopped that wiry parasite from getting what it wanted,” he said cheerfully.

“Yeah, I guess we did. Can you at least tell me what it wanted? Why was the stopwatch so special?” I asked.

“Not for you to know, my friend. The important thing is that you stopped it from being stolen,” he said.

He moved to the hand dryer and used it far longer than necessary.

“Okay, if you aren’t going to tell me what it does, can you at least tell me why you didn’t want it stolen?” I asked.

“Simple. It wasn’t his to steal; it’s mine. Or, more plainly… it’s yours,” he said, looking over his shoulder at me.

I’m a CS student exploring my options and would appreciate insight from people in tech/finance/quant.

# About me

* I’m in my penultimate year of university.
* I don’t go to an Ivy or other “target” school; I had to move to the US halfway through the year, so my options were limited.
* I currently work part-time at a company where I help program statistical applications for fraud, waste, and abuse (so a mix of programming + stats/data work).
* My course has an online option, so I can move physically without it showing as an “online degree” on my transcript.

# What I’m considering

I’m thinking of moving to NYC for my final year because I’m interested in quant/finance-related roles (quant dev, quant research, data-heavy finance roles, etc.).

I understand that:

* NYC won’t magically fix the non-target school issue.
* It won’t suddenly make my applications fly through ATS or guarantee interviews.

I’m mainly thinking about:

* Easier access to networking events, meetups, and conferences.
* More chances for in-person coffee chats with people in banks, funds, and trading firms.
* Better odds at part-time roles or internships during the semester that prefer local candidates.

# My questions

1. For a student, does being in NYC actually make a noticeable difference for quant/finance roles, or is it mostly marginal?
2. Are the networking and proximity benefits worth the cost and hassle of moving for just one year?
3. If you broke into quant/finance from a non-target, did location matter for you?",0,1763312606.0,quantfinance,3,0.5,False
1oyqy0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1oyqy0f/i_am_a_paranormal_research_agent_this_is_my_story/,"I am a Paranormal Research Agent, this is my story. Case #006 ""Night Shift at the compound”","The compound isn’t really a compound; that’s just what we call these branches of the organisation. From the outside, it looks like a regular office building, but once you step inside, it becomes clear it’s anything but.

Each compound follows the same layout.

The first floor is for research offices, where I spend most of my time.

The second floor belongs to the hunters, gyms, training rooms, and a handful of desks.

The third floor is for research testing: lots of lab coats and very little fun.

Then there are the underground levels.

Floor A holds the archives.

Floor B, the vault, stores cursed or otherwise preternatural objects.

Floor C, Containment, houses anything or anyone considered dangerous to society, our realm, or reality itself.

No matter which branch you’re assigned to, stepping into the elevator from the lobby always takes you to one of these floors. I’m not convinced they even exist in our universe anymore; that’s just a theory, though. There are no windows down there, and no one I know has clearance to access anything above or below the floors we use. At least the elevator reliably drops you at the right place.

Lily and I pressed the button for the first floor, and a moment later the doors opened into a large room filled with desks. The blue lighting and white furniture do nothing for the mood, but after long enough, you stop noticing it.

“You get Broussard and meet me in one of the conference rooms,” I said before stepping out of the elevator.

“Alright, but you owe me a coffee. I hate the locker room.” Lily shuddered jokingly. The locker room is what she calls the second floor, which isn’t horribly inaccurate.

I walked over to the small kitchenette closest to my cubicle, which is thankfully near a set of conference rooms. I don’t envy the people who have to walk more than a few minutes to get to their desk, but I guess I never really see them.

“Hey, Aarna,” I said while passing a woman wearing far too many jumpers. Aarna Chopra had been my cubicle neighbour for the past few months. She’s nice and very talkative, something I can’t relate to but I like her. It’s good having a friend actually in my branch of the organisation.

“WHAT?” she yelped as I walked past her toward the coffee machine.

“Oh, Elijah, it’s just you. You’re way too quiet; I need to get you a bell or something,” she said playfully, though still breathing heavily from the fright.

“Not really a bell person. Do you want a coffee? I’m brewing a few,” I asked.

“Ooo, yes please. Who are the other ones for?” she asked with a smile. She leaned back on the counter, fiddling with something in her hand that I couldn’t see.

“Lily and Richard B are having a secret meeting about an entity that may or may not want to kill me,” I said casually.

“Oh,” she said nervously. “Can I join?”



A few minutes later, Richard and Lily entered the small conference room I’d claimed. Aarna sat at the table, using the sleeves of her yellow jumper to hold her coffee cup.

“Yo, Aaron, welcome to the secret club,” Richard said confidently.

“My name is actually Aarna,” she corrected. He cursed under his breath and tried again.

“Shit, sorry, chère. Well, I welcome you to the team, Aarna; the more the merrier,” he said with a large, genuine smile before taking his seat. Lily didn’t say anything but gave me an odd smile when she sat down.

Once everyone was settled, I went over the story of what happened when I was a child, Stalborn, the disappearing kids, Imani, and how he told me William Grey was free, though admittedly in a less emotionally vulnerable way.

After I finished, they sat in silence for a few minutes. I expected questions, not silence.

“So,” I started awkwardly, “what are we all thinking?”

“It’s just a lot to take in, Elijah,” Aarna said, and I saw Richard nodding.

“I’m sorry if this is rude to ask, but… why didn’t it kill you when you were in the car? No one was around, and you didn’t have any protection,” Aarna continued.

My stomach tightened, and blood rushed to my head.

“It is a creature of habit and routine; it has hunting rituals, and you didn’t fit those requirements, not at that point,” Richard jumped in.

“Do you want my advice, or do you want my expert opinion?” he asked before taking a sip of coffee.

I hadn’t even thought about that. I’d been trying to figure out what William Grey was without consulting an actual hunter.

“Well, you are the hunter here. Have you ever hunted something like this?” Lily asked impatiently. Richard smiled.

“Nope, but I am excited to—”

The lights suddenly shut off, and everyone vanished in a wave of fog.

“Woah ho, I honestly wasn’t sure that would work, Mr. Wiltburrow. I’ve only done it a few times over the years, but goddamn am I happy it did,” a familiar husky voice said from all around me. I spun in every direction, and when I turned back toward the table, he was sitting at the end of it.

“Imani, what have you done to me?” I said, panicked and confused.

“Simple. Well, simple for me. I took your consciousness out of the realm of the living and brought you to the dream realm. Thought we should have a chat,” he said, planting both hands on the table.

“This is honestly the worst time, Imani. You’ve had the past few days to talk to me. Why now?” I asked, losing patience.

“Just thought I’d give my favourite research agent a little heads-up: the compound, this little slice of bureaucracy outside of where danger could find you, is currently under attack,” he said with a smile.

“What have you done!” I shouted, but he shook his head.

“Not from me, and not from him.” He lifted his hand and pointed at the glass doors. Standing outside was a tall, pale man, breathing heavily and smiling.

“You know his dreams aren’t particularly fun; a lot to do with you nowadays,” Imani said. William Grey’s eyes were locked on me. His desperation felt real. I wanted to believe he was just a figment of Imani’s fog, but part of me knew this was William Grey and somehow, we were in his dream.

“Anywho,” Imani said, waving Grey away as he dissolved into fog, “just thought I’d let you know that it’s almost here, and it’s looking for something powerful in that vault of yours.”

He waved his hand playfully like a cat batting at a mouse. Suddenly I shot up off the floor. The lights were on. Lily was crouched over me; Aarna was on one side, and Richard stood above them.

I’d forgotten where I was for a moment before adrenaline flushed everything back. Sweat built quickly.

“How long was I out?” I said.

“A few minutes, four or five,” Lily answered. “Elijah, are you okay?”

“No. It was Imani. He said something is coming, and it’s heading for the vault,” I said, trying and failing to stand.

“You think something can get in here?” Richard said skeptically.

The lights shifted to red, and sirens blared.

“All personnel, please evacuate to the evacuation zones on your respective floors. Please stay away from the elevator and do not confront the foreign entity. I repeat…”

“Did you guys even know they had speakers in here? Or alarms?” Richard said.

I ran for the door, but his hand grabbed my wrist. I slipped out easily, but Lily wasn’t as easy to escape. She threw her hand out, and I felt myself yanked back, slamming my tailbone against the edge of the table.

“We can meet them in the vault. Please we need to move,” I begged.

“I don’t know, Elijah; this all feels really weird,” Aarna said, tucking her hands into her sleeves.

“Alright, I trust you. Let’s move,” Lily said. “Aarna, no one will blame you if you go to the evacuation zone, but if Elijah thinks something’s up, then I’m going with him.”

“I can’t help but agree; I’m not a fan of him dragging me around whenever he wants,” I replied.

“You think he can be killed?” Richard asked. I didn’t get the chance to answer.

A scream rang through the vault, bouncing off metal.

Aarna squealed and fell into me. I dropped my flashlight, and it shattered.

“Oh God, I’m so sorry, Elijah—” Aarna started, but I raised my hand.

“It’s okay. Really.”

“Here, take mine. I can see pretty well in the dark,” Richard said, handing me his lamp. He pulled a large machete from his pants and swung it effortlessly.

“How long have you had that in there?” Lily asked, amused despite the situation.

“Every hunter is prepared for anything,” he replied confidently.

“ELINAH!” Lily screamed. The cable she’d been holding slipped past her defence and plunged into her shoulder. She screamed and nearly went limp, dragged toward the creature.

Fear hit something deep inside me.

I crawled to the railing and pulled myself up. The creature reeled Lily closer. Suddenly, an axe spun through the air and embedded itself in the creature’s back.

It screeched a mixture of a man’s scream and an inhuman growl.

I saw Richard and Aarna on the far side. They were unharmed. Relief flooded me.

The cable slid out of Lily’s shoulder and retreated into the creature’s arm. She collapsed against the railing, unconscious.

“Don’t let it impale you!” I yelled.

“Wasn’t my plan!?” Richard shouted. He held a machete in one hand and another throwing axe in the other, both silver.

Aarna ran toward me. She knelt and looked at my torn pants, torn skin.

Without thinking, she took off her yellow jumper, revealing the green one beneath, and tied the yellow one around my wound. She put my arm around her shoulder.

“We have to move,” she said, stuttering with fear but still helping.

I tried to see Richard fighting the creature, but my vision blurred with adrenaline and pain.

Another screech. The catwalk shook. Aarna lost her footing, and we both fell onto the metal.

“Ahhh, dammit,” I groaned.

“Aarna, are you okay?” I said through clenched teeth.

“Yeah. I’m okay, Elijah,” she said, though her tone wasn’t convincing.

I looked across the catwalk and saw Richard crouched over an exhausted but conscious Lily. He held his machete in one hand and an adrenaline syringe in the other.

The creature began to rise again. Richard injected Lily, and she roared back to life.

Richard launched himself forward, stepping onto the railing before leaping. Lily thrust her arms out, psychically pushing him harder toward the creature.

Richard flew into the creature’s upper body. He angled his machete so it drove straight into its skull and down its spine.

The creature spun violently, its eyes flickering with light before returning to a normal human colour.

Then it went still.

Richard tumbled onto the catwalk as the creature fell off the railing, crashing to the floor below.

A few hours later, a large squad of hunters arrived and locked down the area. We were separated and underwent individual tests.

Lily spent the most time in isolation; the higher-ups heard she’d been pierced by the cable. She was the only survivor of that specific injury, so they needed to ensure she wasn’t infected like the hunter the creature took over.

“I don’t think I want to do fieldwork,” Aarna said with a nervous chuckle.

Aarna and I talked in my cubicle like normal. I sat at my desk while she leaned against the wall.

“Trust me, most of the time it’s chasing myths that are just that. This was… something else,” I said while drinking coffee.

She smiled at me. I smiled back. Aarna was a good person.

“I’ll be back in just a minute,” I said, getting up and heading to the bathroom. As I washed my hands, the water shifted—not in temperature, but texture. Something about it felt wrong. Superficial.

I looked at my reflection. Black fog lingered around the bathroom.

“Imani, are you serious? Can’t I even piss in peace?” I snapped.

Why should I expect anything else from him? He respects no timing, so why would he respect the ancient law of the bathroom: do not disturb?

A toilet flushed, and a stall door opened. Imani walked out in a fine suit. He strode casually to the sink beside me and washed his hands.

“My, my, Elijah, you have outdone yourself; you stopped that wiry parasite from getting what it wanted,” he said cheerfully.

“Yeah, I guess we did. Can you at least tell me what it wanted? Why was the stopwatch so special?” I asked.

“Not for you to know, my friend. The important thing is that you stopped it from being stolen,” he said.

He moved to the hand dryer and used it far longer than necessary.

“Okay, if you aren’t going to tell me what it does, can you at least tell me why you didn’t want it stolen?” I asked.

“Simple. It wasn’t his to steal; it’s mine. Or, more plainly… it’s yours,” he said, looking over his shoulder at me.

If you have a couple of minutes to read and recommend a grinder, go ahead⬇️

Hi all,

My wife and I have a Mignon Specialita and we are pretty much sick of it, and wish to sell it to it's next owner.
It's an outdated design, it's noisy for no reason, the taste of espressos coming out of it is inferior to my 1zpresso X-ultra (a conical hand grinder), and when cleaning it there is an unacceptable amount of coffee retained in it.

We drink at home traditional espressos and milk drinks, with medium to full city roasts (locally roasted and single origin of course), making me shift towards a comical burr. We are looking to buy our next sort of endgame single dose grinder.

My budget is not quite high for a kafatek, but it's enough to allow myself almost all other options below it.

The weber key ii is not an option, I think the long shaft was a bad engineering decision and I am not willing to bet this kind of money on it coming with alignment issues.

That leaves me basically with Varia VS6 (and changing the burrs), niche zero, option-o lagom casa, MX cool Aries, or other options I did not come across.

The niche is very loved, but to me it feels like an old design that should have gotten updated by now. 
I am willing to buy something that will completely remove my upgrade itch, and I have the feeling it won't do it.

The Lagom looks weird, and ""Daddy got coffee"" showed in his video how it bends. I did not like that.

Since the issues reported with the vs3, I am having a hard time trusting Varia.

I am gravitating towards the MX cool, after learning that the new 2024 edition has a fixed grind range, new catch cup with tighter tolerances, and a new feeder, but there aren't many opinions out there about the new model.

Any insights about my thoughts? Any hands on experiences with the mentioned grinders above? Any recommendations?

I dissociated when the doctors told me I was on the verge of losing one or both. I made it through stage one and now I have two. I had so many plans and none of them manifested. Everything became a grind. I survived, but it is a blur. We are 3 now and we are growing in independence. The relationship, when I'm not too tired, is the most beautiful thing imaginable. In some ways it's freeing, but I have no idea who I am. I couldn't work even if I wanted to, daycare wasn't an option. I thought I'd home school when the reality struck, but I'm done. I have nothing left and now I feel guilty. I have no career or nowhere to go but they are tiring me out, searching for ways to fulfill their learning and I can't keep up with their incredible minds. I thought I'd travel to wiggle free, but there were hiccoughs. I tried to settle into being a homemaker, but I was raised on frozen or canned food and it was all a bigger battle than I imagined. We found crackers, late mind you but we found them. I remind myself I did an excellent job if I manage one day without them, and often I do many, but I obviously don't notice. I just notice that the other night all we ate were crackers for dinner, after we had them for lunch...because I failed with a meal we didn't like, because we liked it last week and suddenly we don't. I missed the nesting phase to stay 9 hours from home for daily scans and you can tell. I sunk into loneliness watching the world around me on a whole other plane. I reached out for help. I battled shame of not being able to do it myself, shame for having the income to even request it. No one came. Instead, they called children's aid when I was sitting gapped out at the coffee shop in a small townwondering where my life was going, somewhere we frequent and everyone knows us, and now I'll have them up my back because I tried their winter boots on last month and they fit, now it's officially snowing and obviously they don't. They are stubborn and I can't keep their mits on, it's five degrees they aren't going to die. We are also walking five minutes down the road and it's just not worth it when their jackets cover their hands anyway....we are walking, to fulfill their physical outlet instead of driving and that's important right now. Do you know how long it took us just to get into the car? I brushed their hair, I swear, but getting a ponytail in was unfair to everyone so we look like rag dolls. They have their favourite outfits and we are all happier letting the stains slide so I have the juice to bake muffins or do a craft. I'm crawling. But really I'm standing strong, tall and proud to see the amazing people these kids are turning into, but those sinking moments  just damper it all and society doesn't care.

Case #006 ""Night Shift at the compound""","The compound isn’t really a compound; that’s just what we call these branches of the organisation. From the outside, it looks like a regular office building, but once you step inside, it becomes clear it’s anything but.

Each compound follows the same layout.

The first floor is for research offices, where I spend most of my time.

The second floor belongs to the hunters, gyms, training rooms, and a handful of desks.

The third floor is for research testing: lots of lab coats and very little fun.

Then there are the underground levels.

Floor A holds the archives.

Floor B, the vault, stores cursed or otherwise preternatural objects.

Floor C, Containment, houses anything or anyone considered dangerous to society, our realm, or reality itself.

No matter which branch you’re assigned to, stepping into the elevator from the lobby always takes you to one of these floors. I’m not convinced they even exist in our universe anymore; that’s just a theory, though. There are no windows down there, and no one I know has clearance to access anything above or below the floors we use. At least the elevator reliably drops you at the right place.

Lily and I pressed the button for the first floor, and a moment later the doors opened into a large room filled with desks. The blue lighting and white furniture do nothing for the mood, but after long enough, you stop noticing it.

“You get Broussard and meet me in one of the conference rooms,” I said before stepping out of the elevator.

“Alright, but you owe me a coffee. I hate the locker room.” Lily shuddered jokingly. The locker room is what she calls the second floor, which isn’t horribly inaccurate.

I walked over to the small kitchenette closest to my cubicle, which is thankfully near a set of conference rooms. I don’t envy the people who have to walk more than a few minutes to get to their desk, but I guess I never really see them.

“Hey, Aarna,” I said while passing a woman wearing far too many jumpers. Aarna Chopra had been my cubicle neighbour for the past few months. She’s nice and very talkative, something I can’t relate to but I like her. It’s good having a friend actually in my branch of the organisation.

“WHAT?” she yelped as I walked past her toward the coffee machine.

“Oh, Elijah, it’s just you. You’re way too quiet; I need to get you a bell or something,” she said playfully, though still breathing heavily from the fright.

“Not really a bell person. Do you want a coffee? I’m brewing a few,” I asked.

“Ooo, yes please. Who are the other ones for?” she asked with a smile. She leaned back on the counter, fiddling with something in her hand that I couldn’t see.

“Lily and Richard B are having a secret meeting about an entity that may or may not want to kill me,” I said casually.

“Oh,” she said nervously. “Can I join?”



A few minutes later, Richard and Lily entered the small conference room I’d claimed. Aarna sat at the table, using the sleeves of her yellow jumper to hold her coffee cup.

“Yo, Aaron, welcome to the secret club,” Richard said confidently.

“My name is actually Aarna,” she corrected. He cursed under his breath and tried again.

“Shit, sorry, chère. Well, I welcome you to the team, Aarna; the more the merrier,” he said with a large, genuine smile before taking his seat. Lily didn’t say anything but gave me an odd smile when she sat down.

Once everyone was settled, I went over the story of what happened when I was a child, Stalborn, the disappearing kids, Imani, and how he told me William Grey was free, though admittedly in a less emotionally vulnerable way.

After I finished, they sat in silence for a few minutes. I expected questions, not silence.

“So,” I started awkwardly, “what are we all thinking?”

“It’s just a lot to take in, Elijah,” Aarna said, and I saw Richard nodding.

“I’m sorry if this is rude to ask, but… why didn’t it kill you when you were in the car? No one was around, and you didn’t have any protection,” Aarna continued.

My stomach tightened, and blood rushed to my head.

“It is a creature of habit and routine; it has hunting rituals, and you didn’t fit those requirements, not at that point,” Richard jumped in.

“Do you want my advice, or do you want my expert opinion?” he asked before taking a sip of coffee.

I hadn’t even thought about that. I’d been trying to figure out what William Grey was without consulting an actual hunter.

“Well, you are the hunter here. Have you ever hunted something like this?” Lily asked impatiently. Richard smiled.

“Nope, but I am excited to—”

The lights suddenly shut off, and everyone vanished in a wave of fog.

“Woah ho, I honestly wasn’t sure that would work, Mr. Wiltburrow. I’ve only done it a few times over the years, but goddamn am I happy it did,” a familiar husky voice said from all around me. I spun in every direction, and when I turned back toward the table, he was sitting at the end of it.

“Imani, what have you done to me?” I said, panicked and confused.

“Simple. Well, simple for me. I took your consciousness out of the realm of the living and brought you to the dream realm. Thought we should have a chat,” he said, planting both hands on the table.

“This is honestly the worst time, Imani. You’ve had the past few days to talk to me. Why now?” I asked, losing patience.

“Just thought I’d give my favourite research agent a little heads-up: the compound, this little slice of bureaucracy outside of where danger could find you, is currently under attack,” he said with a smile.

“What have you done!” I shouted, but he shook his head.

“Not from me, and not from him.” He lifted his hand and pointed at the glass doors. Standing outside was a tall, pale man, breathing heavily and smiling.

“You know his dreams aren’t particularly fun; a lot to do with you nowadays,” Imani said. William Grey’s eyes were locked on me. His desperation felt real. I wanted to believe he was just a figment of Imani’s fog, but part of me knew this was William Grey and somehow, we were in his dream.

“Anywho,” Imani said, waving Grey away as he dissolved into fog, “just thought I’d let you know that it’s almost here, and it’s looking for something powerful in that vault of yours.”

He waved his hand playfully like a cat batting at a mouse. Suddenly I shot up off the floor. The lights were on. Lily was crouched over me; Aarna was on one side, and Richard stood above them.

I’d forgotten where I was for a moment before adrenaline flushed everything back. Sweat built quickly.

“How long was I out?” I said.

“A few minutes, four or five,” Lily answered. “Elijah, are you okay?”

“No. It was Imani. He said something is coming, and it’s heading for the vault,” I said, trying and failing to stand.

“You think something can get in here?” Richard said skeptically.

The lights shifted to red, and sirens blared.

“All personnel, please evacuate to the evacuation zones on your respective floors. Please stay away from the elevator and do not confront the foreign entity. I repeat…”

“Did you guys even know they had speakers in here? Or alarms?” Richard said.

I ran for the door, but his hand grabbed my wrist. I slipped out easily, but Lily wasn’t as easy to escape. She threw her hand out, and I felt myself yanked back, slamming my tailbone against the edge of the table.

“Where do you think you’re going, Elijah?” Lily asked, almost accusatory.

I considered lying, saying I was going to the evacuation zone, but these people, Aarna, Richard, Lily, were my friends.

“The elevator. Imani warned me that something is breaking into the vault to steal something powerful,” I confessed.

“And you alone were going to stop it,” she said sarcastically. “I have so many things I want to say right now,” she added, lowering her arm. The weight lifted and I stood.

“Okay, I think I know what you want to say. Can we please talk on the way?” I urged.

“Shouldn’t we go to the evacuation zones?” Aarna asked.

“Aarna, in all the time you’ve worked here, have you ever seen an evacuation zone? Any of you? Or heard an alarm?” I asked. They all shook their heads.

“Maybe… I don’t know. It is pretty weird,” Aarna said.

“The hunters would be on the move,” Richard muttered. “Shit. Most of them are in the field. It’s only me and a handful of others.”

“We should meet up with them,” Lily said.

“We can meet them in the vault. Please we need to move,” I begged.

“I don’t know, Elijah; this all feels really weird,” Aarna said, tucking her hands into her sleeves.

“Alright, I trust you. Let’s move,” Lily said. “Aarna, no one will blame you if you go to the evacuation zone, but if Elijah thinks something’s up, then I’m going with him.”

The doors opened to the vault: a long, dark, metallic hallway. The lights were off, the air cold. Familiar somehow, but I couldn’t place it.

The vault is a large metallic maze with small enclosures for each paranormal artefact, almost like a zoo. It’s easy to get turned around.

We made our way in slowly. Richard and Lily led with camping lamps; Aarna and I followed with flashlights.

“So, what are we looking for exactly?” Richard whispered.

“I don’t know. Imani just said it was powerful,” I said.

“I don’t think I like this dream man,” Lily added.

“I can’t help but agree; I’m not a fan of him dragging me around whenever he wants,” I replied.

“You think he can be killed?” Richard asked. I didn’t get the chance to answer.

A scream rang through the vault, bouncing off metal.

Aarna squealed and fell into me. I dropped my flashlight, and it shattered.

“Oh God, I’m so sorry, Elijah—” Aarna started, but I raised my hand.

“It’s okay. Really.”

“Here, take mine. I can see pretty well in the dark,” Richard said, handing me his lamp. He pulled a large machete from his pants and swung it effortlessly.

“How long have you had that in there?” Lily asked, amused despite the situation.

“Every hunter is prepared for anything,” he replied confidently.

“Even accidental cuts on your dick?” Lily shot back.

Under any other circumstances, that would’ve earned a laugh but tonight, silence. Except for another scream.

“Everyone stay close,” Richard said, and we huddled together.

We moved forward until Richard held up a hand.

“Hold up the hallway branches.”

“Wait, that doesn’t make sense. I’ve been down here before. I thought things seemed different, but this is completely changed,” Aarna said.

“Are you sure? Can this floor change?” Lily asked.

“She’s right, Lily. I’ve been down here a few times. It’s not like this.” My heart pounded.

“We should split up,” I said.

“Are you serious? Splitting up is a horrible idea,” Aarna said.

“I know, but we can’t let whatever’s down here get what it’s looking for and since we don’t know what that is, we need to cover more ground,” I said. They stared.

“What?” I asked.

“Nothing you’ve just taken more to fieldwork than I expected,” Lily said. “Aarna, go with Richard. He’s the most likely to survive, so you’ll have pretty great odds. Elijah and I will go left, you two go right.”



“So, you know Aarna definitely has a thing for you, right?” Lily said as we walked.

“What are you talking about?” I said, genuinely surprised. She always makes small talk during tense situations, but this caught me off guard.

“Don’t act like you don’t see it. You’re dumb, but you’re the smart type of dumb.”

“Ouch,” I muttered.

Before she could continue, a screeching noise rang out ahead. Lily closed her eyes briefly, reached a hand forward, and whispered, “Oh God,” before sprinting into the dark. I followed.

What we found was something I wish I hadn’t seen.

A hunter lay on the ground her lower half missing, organs dragged along behind her upper body. Barbed wire wrapped around and pierced through her. A soft, piercing screech escaped her slightly open mouth, like a final scream looping forever.

Dear God. Her face was unrecognisable. A hook pierced her right eye, attached to a cable stretching into the dark. It was pulling her toward something. We both knew we had to stop it.

I looked away instinctively. This was the worst thing I’d ever seen. Lily took a few steps back and gagged.

“Jesus fuck,” she choked.

I forced myself to focus on anything else and saw a revolver clutched in the corpse’s hand. Likely organisation-issued silver bullets. Shielding my eyes, I unpeeled her still-warm fingers and took the weapon.

I felt suspended between overwhelming emotion and complete numbness. Ever since remembering Stalborn, death has taken on new meaning.

“Let’s keep moving,” Lily said once she steadied herself.

“Alright,” I said, holding the revolver out. I had no experience with firearms, but in a hallway, it wouldn’t matter.

We followed the metal wire deeper. Neither of us spoke.

My thoughts drifted to Aarna. Richard could handle himself, but Aarna had never done fieldwork. What had I pressured her into?

Gunshots suddenly exploded ahead. I flinched hard.

“Shit, that was ahead of us,” I said.

We ran. The hallway opened into a tall room lined with enclosures. Scaffolding climbed the right wall toward catwalks crossing multiple levels.

“We have to go up,” Lily said.

“Are you sure—”

A man wearing a hunter’s vest fell from above and hit the floor with a wet, heavy splat.

We climbed. The higher we went, the more flesh hung from above like meat in a slaughterhouse.

The smell was overwhelming. I felt myself slipping toward shock.

At the top, we saw two figures. One hunter swung an axe at another hunter except the second had jagged metal pieces jutting from his neck and face.

The axe-wielder swung hard. The other stepped aside and thrust his hand out. Metal cables burst from his wrist and forearm, digging into the axe-wielder and yanking her off the railing. As she fell, the cables wrapped around the railing, suspending her body midair.

The creature looked at us. Its eyes glowed orange like headlights through fog.

“HYAH!” Lily grunted, thrusting her hands out. Cables shot toward us from under its skin, but she flung the creature off the scaffolding.

I ran toward where it fell. My footsteps echoed like thunder. I found an enclosure with only a lectern. On it sat a pocket watch. I tried the door, it was locked. I fired at the glass. The bullet did nothing.

Of course. It was the vault. Why would the glass break?

Metallic booms erupted behind me. I turned to see large metallic arms, wires wrapped together, dig into the scaffolding. The creature was climbing back up, arms protruding from its back like broken wings.

I aimed at it, but my hands shook violently. Panic overwhelmed me. I fired once completely missing and dropped the gun.

“Lily!” I screamed. She stood on the staircase, trying to force the thing back down, but it wasn’t working. The creature aimed at her and shot a metal wire. As it neared her, it slowed. She was holding it back, but it shook violently.

“Hey dickhead!” I yelled. It turned its offhand toward me, and I ripped the cable out of its palm. I dove, but not fast enough, the cable grazed my thigh, slicing it open. Pain exploded through me.

“ELINAH!” Lily screamed. The cable she’d been holding slipped past her defence and plunged into her shoulder. She screamed and nearly went limp, dragged toward the creature.

Fear hit something deep inside me.

I crawled to the railing and pulled myself up. The creature reeled Lily closer. Suddenly, an axe spun through the air and embedded itself in the creature’s back.

It screeched a mixture of a man’s scream and an inhuman growl.

I saw Richard and Aarna on the far side. They were unharmed. Relief flooded me.

The cable slid out of Lily’s shoulder and retreated into the creature’s arm. She collapsed against the railing, unconscious.

“Don’t let it impale you!” I yelled.

“Wasn’t my plan!?” Richard shouted. He held a machete in one hand and another throwing axe in the other, both silver.

Aarna ran toward me. She knelt and looked at my torn pants, torn skin.

Without thinking, she took off her yellow jumper, revealing the green one beneath, and tied the yellow one around my wound. She put my arm around her shoulder.

“We have to move,” she said, stuttering with fear but still helping.

I tried to see Richard fighting the creature, but my vision blurred with adrenaline and pain.

Another screech. The catwalk shook. Aarna lost her footing, and we both fell onto the metal.

“Ahhh, dammit,” I groaned.

“Aarna, are you okay?” I said through clenched teeth.

“Yeah. I’m okay, Elijah,” she said, though her tone wasn’t convincing.

I looked across the catwalk and saw Richard crouched over an exhausted but conscious Lily. He held his machete in one hand and an adrenaline syringe in the other.

The creature began to rise again. Richard injected Lily, and she roared back to life.

Richard launched himself forward, stepping onto the railing before leaping. Lily thrust her arms out, psychically pushing him harder toward the creature.

Richard flew into the creature’s upper body. He angled his machete so it drove straight into its skull and down its spine.

The creature spun violently, its eyes flickering with light before returning to a normal human colour.

Then it went still.

Richard tumbled onto the catwalk as the creature fell off the railing, crashing to the floor below.

A few hours later, a large squad of hunters arrived and locked down the area. We were separated and underwent individual tests.

Lily spent the most time in isolation; the higher-ups heard she’d been pierced by the cable. She was the only survivor of that specific injury, so they needed to ensure she wasn’t infected like the hunter the creature took over.

“I don’t think I want to do fieldwork,” Aarna said with a nervous chuckle.

Aarna and I talked in my cubicle like normal. I sat at my desk while she leaned against the wall.

“Trust me, most of the time it’s chasing myths that are just that. This was… something else,” I said while drinking coffee.

She smiled at me. I smiled back. Aarna was a good person.

“I’ll be back in just a minute,” I said, getting up and heading to the bathroom. As I washed my hands, the water shifted—not in temperature, but texture. Something about it felt wrong. Superficial.

I looked at my reflection. Black fog lingered around the bathroom.

“Imani, are you serious? Can’t I even piss in peace?” I snapped.

Why should I expect anything else from him? He respects no timing, so why would he respect the ancient law of the bathroom: do not disturb?

A toilet flushed, and a stall door opened. Imani walked out in a fine suit. He strode casually to the sink beside me and washed his hands.

“My, my, Elijah, you have outdone yourself; you stopped that wiry parasite from getting what it wanted,” he said cheerfully.

“Yeah, I guess we did. Can you at least tell me what it wanted? Why was the stopwatch so special?” I asked.

“Not for you to know, my friend. The important thing is that you stopped it from being stolen,” he said.

He moved to the hand dryer and used it far longer than necessary.

“Okay, if you aren’t going to tell me what it does, can you at least tell me why you didn’t want it stolen?” I asked.

“Simple. It wasn’t his to steal; it’s mine. Or, more plainly… it’s yours,” he said, looking over his shoulder at me.

1oyqof3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1oyqof3/aitah_for_hitting_my_mom/,AITAH for hitting my mom?,"So I’m going to try and include everything I possibly can even stuff that has happened in the past to try and shed more light onto the situation. So be prepared for a long post and I do apologize for any grammar errors or if the story is all over the place as I’m currently writing this through tears and shaking……Okay so a little back story I did not have a great childhood. I was the child who was deemed mature for their age, I was the bedroom kid, and I was also the family therapist, maid, mediator through fights, if you named it that was me. I honestly don’t even remember much from my childhood except mostly bad things. My dad was a drug addict narcissist and my mom was VERY bipolar and I’m being to think she’s also a narcissist. They would often get into fights throughout my entire life. And when I mean fights I mean fist fights. And as I got older my mom would use me as her shield from him and as her therapist. From the time I was in 5th grade maybe even before until the time I moved out she would often tell me how much she hated her life and didn’t care about anyone. And she just wanted to end it all by shooting herself in the head. So because of all this I would then get into fights with him because of her trying to protect her. He would often tell me if she ever left him I’d be the reason why and I can understand why but I wasnt the only problem around..I tried moving away a few times to try and get away from it all. But my mom would ALWAYS guilt trip me into coming back. She would send me pictures of my dad putting cigarettes out on her face and just beg me to save her. And I always would because I deeply loved my mom and at a younger age I always thought it was my dad’s doing. But when I got to be about 20 l started to see more. I would see my mom being very disrespectful to him. She would get in his face screaming, shoving him so hard he almost falls, and saying awful things that would trigger him and that’s when they would start fighting. Now still some of the fights were his fault also because of him being disrespectful as well…..I only had 1 sibling also. An Older sister but she wasn’t any better than them so I couldn’t turn to her. She’d call me the most disgusting things at a young age and would constantly bully me. She would purposely do things for attention. Such as one time when my dad was in prison she cut herself called me into her room and preceded to show me. Acting like it wasn’t a big deal. But at this time I was probably around 11 or 12 so seeing a gash on my sisters arm I freaked out and told my mom. Which she then took me and her to children’s and they admitted her to the psych ward while I had to stay with my grandmother so they could all go tend to her. So it was just stuff like that continuously through out my childhood. So needless to say I have a lot of problems that I go through now from the trauma that I endured. I have severe ptsd, I have depression, I can’t even leave my house without having several panic attacks while I’m gone. My husband he helps when he can. If I’m having an attack he knows how to help calm me. So I’m very grateful for him. He’s been my rock and protector since 2018…..but now to the issue at hand. So this past week we had a mini family vacation. It was me 27F, my husband 30M, my mom and dad both are 48, my aunt she’s in her 50s (moms sister), my nanna(my moms mom), and my cousin he’s in his 30s (child from my other moms sister). My aunt and my sister DO NOT get along because my sister broke up the family several years ago. So this trip was the first time I’ve seen my cousin in YEARS and I was excited. Well the trip was for 5 days at a cabin in TN. We left Monday and came back Saturday. 3 1/2 out of the 5 days of the trip my mom was sulking and throwing a pity party for herself because her and my dad were giving each other the cold shoulder. She wasn’t really involved in any of the activities except shopping. She wouldn’t come to the bonfire, she wouldn’t play pool, poker, ping pong, or even get in the hottub. The cabin had all of this. And she just wasn’t having any of it. I tried several times to Involve her because I really wanted to spend time with her as I don’t see her very often and she just didn’t want to. Which is fine I understand you don’t want to walk down the stairs into the basement because you hurt sometimes. I’m just glad my nanna decided to join us downstairs it was fun and I got wonderful pictures with her in them. Well Friday comes around and everyone is already in that mood where they are dreading it ending and don’t want to go home. Well we were all outside and my mom comes outside and you can tell she’s just in a mood. My aunt asks her what’s wrong with her and my dad and she told everyone my dad was mad at her for her not giving out. And my aunt was like oh. Well like 10 minutes go by and my aunt asks my mom you okay my mom says “I’m still breathing, Unfortunately.” Anytime she’s in a mood she makes comments like that all the time and just not wanting to do anything. The entire day does by like that. Well later that night I was trying to lighten the mood. If you have TikTok there is a trend going around where you take a picture of someone and video the sound it suggests. I was like oh I’d love to do that and my mom was like I’m not doing that. Well my husband didn’t really want to either but he seen I was trying to bring in good energy and try to lighten the mood so he gave me his phone to record on. I told everybody I was NOT going to post it. It was just for our own satisfaction and to be able too look back at the video on future trips. So my Nanna and cousin let me do theirs, and I did my husband. I then went outside to show my mom and she just kinda chuckled. Well I was like your turn. And in that down voice people have she was like nope I told you I’m not doing that and I was like I’m not posting them and she said no. I’m not going to lie. It triggered me. I immediately got upset and said “fuck this shit I’m tired of it” got up and went inside. Well I turned around to go back outside and give my husband his phone because I still had it from recording. As soon as I walked outside I caught my mom going off and talking shit about me to my aunt. I said something to her that made her mad but I ignored her and I was going to let it slide. I walked around the table in front of the fireplace to grab a cigarette and go downstairs(that’s where me and my husbands room is as well as the game room). And as soon as I went around the coffee table to grab the pack my mom stood up from her chair (she was sitting by the fireplace) and immediately got in my face screaming and yelling at me. If I would’ve moved my head just forward a little bit our noses would’ve been touching. That’s how close she was to me. I just stood there while she was yelling and instead of saying anything I blew a puff of air at her. Granted she probably did get spit on her because of how close she was but I was not purposely trying to spit on her. If I wanted too I would’ve hawked something at her instead. This is relevant to the story. Well as soon as I blew air out at her I went to turn around to go downstairs. Well when I did that she shoved me so hard I almost fell. And I immediately turned around and punched her. It happened before I even knew what was happening. But as soon as I hit her she immediately grabbed me by my scalp. And was yanking me around hitting me and pulling my hair. And I have butt length hair. So it hurt very bad and I couldn’t really move as she had me at the scalp. Well next thing I know we were on the couch and she was pinning me down and I was shoving her face trying to get her off of me as she was hurting me. My mom is 5,9-5,10 i think 240lbs I am 5,3 180lbs so she is much bigger than I am. Well at the time i wasn’t  sure what happened but we went from  the couch to standing and I still couldn’t see because my mom still had my hair pulling my head upwards. But I hear my dad come out yelling who hit you and I then feel hands ripping her hands off of me. She finally let go. When she let go everyone except my nanna was outside. My cousin said what’s that smell and it was burning hair. It was mine. So in the midst of us fighting she either had a cigarette or my husband did and it got me when we were tussling. Well my mom was still steadily yelling. She was irate. I honestly don’t remember what all was said but I know I told her at one point. What type of mother treats their daughter the way you did telling her she wanting to shoot herself in the head. Not a very good one. I told her I’m a better mother than she is. And she told me you aren’t even a mother you don’t have custody of your kids (which is true. But it was nothing that I did. I have been fighting DHR so hard. And they have been nothing but crooked towards me and have told the judge I wasn’t doing anything they asked even though I had proof I did everything they wanted of me and that I was clean. We had to take a psychological evaluation and they told us we were absolutely fine. We did parenting classes. And I even did extra ones. We did drug tests. We even had to go to a sobriety person and they told me I had absolutely no problem and they don’t even know why dhr sent me. I had videos and voice memos of my worker talking shit about me and my husband saying we were unfit and meth heads even though that was proven 100% WRONG. I sent them to my lawyer and nothing was done. I even asked for all of my court documents but they never gave them to me. Turns out my lawyer and worker were friends. And it’s $10,000 to hire a new lawyer to fight the state. And I just can’t afford that being on disability. And my mom knows this. I still spend time with my kids they know who I am and everything. I just don’t physically have custody of them one of my family members on my moms side does) so after she said that I told her when I get them back she’d never see them again and she told me she’d make it to where they never let me see my kids again and I went inside after that. Well my husband comes downstairs to see if I’m okay because my lip was busted and right under my eye was swollen. He had told me that my dad and mom were arguing because my dad told my mom “well she’s not wrong” when I went inside. Needless to say my mom left because I wouldn’t and she left my dad there as well. When she left my nanna and aunt called her and she was telling them I started it that I spit in her face and that I hit her first. Which is technically true I did swing first after she shoved me. And I did feel bad for doing it as I have never done anything like that before. Well after calling her my cousin was brushing my hair from where she had a grip. And the amount of hair that came out could fit in the palm of your hand and you wouldn’t see skin. It was a huge amount needless to say. Well everyone was talking about what had happened and I told them I felt her hit me 4 times and that because of her already telling them I started it I was scared she really was going to make it where I didn’t see my kids. And my aunt said I won’t let that happen. You tell them to call me I was out there and seen it all. Which my husband and aunt were out there. My aunt was just behind my mom’s back so couldn’t see much. However my husband could see both our faces etc. He had told us that he could see everything. He said that when she lunged at me her glasses fell and I stepped on them which I felt it so I know I did. He said he got up from the couch we fell on to try and grab my mom by the waist to get her off of me and she wasn’t. So he put his forearm around her neck to try and pull her back because he is 6’2. He did not have her in chokehold and was not trying to hurt her but didn’t want her pinning me down either. He said he pulled her up and when he did I went with her because she wouldn’t let go. He said my dad came out there and went for him first until he realized what was going on and got her hands off of me….Well fast forward it’s the next day and my dad rides with us because we don’t live far from them. Well on the car ride we were talking about everything and my dad opened up to me. My mom has been telling everyone she does everything and she just gets used as a piece of meat. Well my dad said They only were intimate twice last year and that she just stays in her room drinking not talking to him. I told him they needed to either leave each other or go to an actual therapist to work it out. But I didn’t want to be involved anymore. Well we get to his house drop him off and my mom’s “best friend” lives right across the street and was standing in the doorway as we were leaving the driveway. She was on the phone with someone just figured it was my mom. Well we get to my husbands dads house and there’s not very good service there but my dad tried calling us several times. I found service and called him back. He told me the cops showed up there and the friend across the street said he was breaking in she didn’t know who he was and he didn’t live there. The door was unlocked and he’s lived there 20 something years. Well I called my aunt to see what was up because I had my mom blocked and she wasn’t answering my dad. And I knew she was at my aunts house because she had sent me a picture of my mom crying and a bruise on her chin where I hit her and scratches on her from when I was trying to shove her off of me( but my mom has told everyone SEVERAL times she bruises very easily one small scratch is a bruise) well on the phone with my aunt her story COMPLETELY changes. It went from she seen everything to I was the only one who hit her and that my mom was only pulling my hair not hitting me. I told her BS because I have bruises too just not as bad and I felt her hit me. She told me the bruises were from us wrestling around and that I basically didn’t feel her hit me. She was also trying to say my husband put the rest of the scratches on her and that he’s the one who broke her glasses when he put her in a chokehold. But in the picture there is no bruise on her neck. He also said he didn’t want to hurt her and he is not the type of man who condones violence to a woman. The only reason my aunts story changed is because that’s what my mom had said had happened and because she showed up crying with a bruise on her. So now I have suddenly turned into a bad person for hitting my mom regardless how she was treating me. So Reddit AITA?",0,1763311991.0,AITAH,7,0.33,False
1oyqo4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1oyqo4u/i_am_a_paranormal_research_agent_this_is_my_story/,"I am a Paranormal Research Agent, this is my story. Case #006 ""Night Shift at the compound""","The compound isn’t really a compound; that’s just what we call these branches of the organisation. From the outside, it looks like a regular office building, but once you step inside, it becomes clear it’s anything but.

Each compound follows the same layout.

The first floor is for research offices, where I spend most of my time.

The second floor belongs to the hunters, gyms, training rooms, and a handful of desks.

The third floor is for research testing: lots of lab coats and very little fun.

Then there are the underground levels.

Floor A holds the archives.

Floor B, the vault, stores cursed or otherwise preternatural objects.

Floor C, Containment, houses anything or anyone considered dangerous to society, our realm, or reality itself.

No matter which branch you’re assigned to, stepping into the elevator from the lobby always takes you to one of these floors. I’m not convinced they even exist in our universe anymore; that’s just a theory, though. There are no windows down there, and no one I know has clearance to access anything above or below the floors we use. At least the elevator reliably drops you at the right place.

Lily and I pressed the button for the first floor, and a moment later the doors opened into a large room filled with desks. The blue lighting and white furniture do nothing for the mood, but after long enough, you stop noticing it.

“You get Broussard and meet me in one of the conference rooms,” I said before stepping out of the elevator.

“Alright, but you owe me a coffee. I hate the locker room.” Lily shuddered jokingly. The locker room is what she calls the second floor, which isn’t horribly inaccurate.

I walked over to the small kitchenette closest to my cubicle, which is thankfully near a set of conference rooms. I don’t envy the people who have to walk more than a few minutes to get to their desk, but I guess I never really see them.

“Hey, Aarna,” I said while passing a woman wearing far too many jumpers. Aarna Chopra had been my cubicle neighbour for the past few months. She’s nice and very talkative, something I can’t relate to but I like her. It’s good having a friend actually in my branch of the organisation.

“WHAT?” she yelped as I walked past her toward the coffee machine.

“Oh, Elijah, it’s just you. You’re way too quiet; I need to get you a bell or something,” she said playfully, though still breathing heavily from the fright.

“Not really a bell person. Do you want a coffee? I’m brewing a few,” I asked.

“Ooo, yes please. Who are the other ones for?” she asked with a smile. She leaned back on the counter, fiddling with something in her hand that I couldn’t see.

“Lily and Richard B are having a secret meeting about an entity that may or may not want to kill me,” I said casually.

“Oh,” she said nervously. “Can I join?”



A few minutes later, Richard and Lily entered the small conference room I’d claimed. Aarna sat at the table, using the sleeves of her yellow jumper to hold her coffee cup.

“Yo, Aaron, welcome to the secret club,” Richard said confidently.

“My name is actually Aarna,” she corrected. He cursed under his breath and tried again.

“Shit, sorry, chère. Well, I welcome you to the team, Aarna; the more the merrier,” he said with a large, genuine smile before taking his seat. Lily didn’t say anything but gave me an odd smile when she sat down.

Once everyone was settled, I went over the story of what happened when I was a child, Stalborn, the disappearing kids, Imani, and how he told me William Grey was free, though admittedly in a less emotionally vulnerable way.

After I finished, they sat in silence for a few minutes. I expected questions, not silence.

“So,” I started awkwardly, “what are we all thinking?”

“It’s just a lot to take in, Elijah,” Aarna said, and I saw Richard nodding.

“I’m sorry if this is rude to ask, but… why didn’t it kill you when you were in the car? No one was around, and you didn’t have any protection,” Aarna continued.

My stomach tightened, and blood rushed to my head.

“It is a creature of habit and routine; it has hunting rituals, and you didn’t fit those requirements, not at that point,” Richard jumped in.

“Do you want my advice, or do you want my expert opinion?” he asked before taking a sip of coffee.

I hadn’t even thought about that. I’d been trying to figure out what William Grey was without consulting an actual hunter.

“Well, you are the hunter here. Have you ever hunted something like this?” Lily asked impatiently. Richard smiled.

“Nope, but I am excited to—”

The lights suddenly shut off, and everyone vanished in a wave of fog.

“Woah ho, I honestly wasn’t sure that would work, Mr. Wiltburrow. I’ve only done it a few times over the years, but goddamn am I happy it did,” a familiar husky voice said from all around me. I spun in every direction, and when I turned back toward the table, he was sitting at the end of it.

“Imani, what have you done to me?” I said, panicked and confused.

“Simple. Well, simple for me. I took your consciousness out of the realm of the living and brought you to the dream realm. Thought we should have a chat,” he said, planting both hands on the table.

“This is honestly the worst time, Imani. You’ve had the past few days to talk to me. Why now?” I asked, losing patience.

“Just thought I’d give my favourite research agent a little heads-up: the compound, this little slice of bureaucracy outside of where danger could find you, is currently under attack,” he said with a smile.

“What have you done!” I shouted, but he shook his head.

“Not from me, and not from him.” He lifted his hand and pointed at the glass doors. Standing outside was a tall, pale man, breathing heavily and smiling.

“You know his dreams aren’t particularly fun; a lot to do with you nowadays,” Imani said. William Grey’s eyes were locked on me. His desperation felt real. I wanted to believe he was just a figment of Imani’s fog, but part of me knew this was William Grey and somehow, we were in his dream.

“Anywho,” Imani said, waving Grey away as he dissolved into fog, “just thought I’d let you know that it’s almost here, and it’s looking for something powerful in that vault of yours.”

He waved his hand playfully like a cat batting at a mouse. Suddenly I shot up off the floor. The lights were on. Lily was crouched over me; Aarna was on one side, and Richard stood above them.

I’d forgotten where I was for a moment before adrenaline flushed everything back. Sweat built quickly.

“How long was I out?” I said.

“A few minutes, four or five,” Lily answered. “Elijah, are you okay?”

“No. It was Imani. He said something is coming, and it’s heading for the vault,” I said, trying and failing to stand.

“You think something can get in here?” Richard said skeptically.

The lights shifted to red, and sirens blared.

“All personnel, please evacuate to the evacuation zones on your respective floors. Please stay away from the elevator and do not confront the foreign entity. I repeat…”

“Did you guys even know they had speakers in here? Or alarms?” Richard said.

I ran for the door, but his hand grabbed my wrist. I slipped out easily, but Lily wasn’t as easy to escape. She threw her hand out, and I felt myself yanked back, slamming my tailbone against the edge of the table.

“Where do you think you’re going, Elijah?” Lily asked, almost accusatory.

I considered lying, saying I was going to the evacuation zone, but these people, Aarna, Richard, Lily, were my friends.

“The elevator. Imani warned me that something is breaking into the vault to steal something powerful,” I confessed.

“And you alone were going to stop it,” she said sarcastically. “I have so many things I want to say right now,” she added, lowering her arm. The weight lifted and I stood.

“Okay, I think I know what you want to say. Can we please talk on the way?” I urged.

“Shouldn’t we go to the evacuation zones?” Aarna asked.

“Aarna, in all the time you’ve worked here, have you ever seen an evacuation zone? Any of you? Or heard an alarm?” I asked. They all shook their heads.

“Maybe… I don’t know. It is pretty weird,” Aarna said.

“The hunters would be on the move,” Richard muttered. “Shit. Most of them are in the field. It’s only me and a handful of others.”

“We should meet up with them,” Lily said.

“We can meet them in the vault. Please we need to move,” I begged.

“I don’t know, Elijah; this all feels really weird,” Aarna said, tucking her hands into her sleeves.

“Alright, I trust you. Let’s move,” Lily said. “Aarna, no one will blame you if you go to the evacuation zone, but if Elijah thinks something’s up, then I’m going with him.”

The doors opened to the vault: a long, dark, metallic hallway. The lights were off, the air cold. Familiar somehow, but I couldn’t place it.

The vault is a large metallic maze with small enclosures for each paranormal artefact, almost like a zoo. It’s easy to get turned around.

We made our way in slowly. Richard and Lily led with camping lamps; Aarna and I followed with flashlights.

“So, what are we looking for exactly?” Richard whispered.

“I don’t know. Imani just said it was powerful,” I said.

“I don’t think I like this dream man,” Lily added.

“I can’t help but agree; I’m not a fan of him dragging me around whenever he wants,” I replied.

“You think he can be killed?” Richard asked. I didn’t get the chance to answer.

A scream rang through the vault, bouncing off metal.

Aarna squealed and fell into me. I dropped my flashlight, and it shattered.

“Oh God, I’m so sorry, Elijah—” Aarna started, but I raised my hand.

“It’s okay. Really.”

“Here, take mine. I can see pretty well in the dark,” Richard said, handing me his lamp. He pulled a large machete from his pants and swung it effortlessly.

“How long have you had that in there?” Lily asked, amused despite the situation.

“Every hunter is prepared for anything,” he replied confidently.

“Even accidental cuts on your dick?” Lily shot back.

Under any other circumstances, that would’ve earned a laugh but tonight, silence. Except for another scream.

“Everyone stay close,” Richard said, and we huddled together.

We moved forward until Richard held up a hand.

“Hold up the hallway branches.”

“Wait, that doesn’t make sense. I’ve been down here before. I thought things seemed different, but this is completely changed,” Aarna said.

“Are you sure? Can this floor change?” Lily asked.

“She’s right, Lily. I’ve been down here a few times. It’s not like this.” My heart pounded.

“We should split up,” I said.

“Are you serious? Splitting up is a horrible idea,” Aarna said.

“I know, but we can’t let whatever’s down here get what it’s looking for and since we don’t know what that is, we need to cover more ground,” I said. They stared.

“What?” I asked.

“Nothing you’ve just taken more to fieldwork than I expected,” Lily said. “Aarna, go with Richard. He’s the most likely to survive, so you’ll have pretty great odds. Elijah and I will go left, you two go right.”



“So, you know Aarna definitely has a thing for you, right?” Lily said as we walked.

“What are you talking about?” I said, genuinely surprised. She always makes small talk during tense situations, but this caught me off guard.

“Don’t act like you don’t see it. You’re dumb, but you’re the smart type of dumb.”

“Ouch,” I muttered.

Before she could continue, a screeching noise rang out ahead. Lily closed her eyes briefly, reached a hand forward, and whispered, “Oh God,” before sprinting into the dark. I followed.

What we found was something I wish I hadn’t seen.

A hunter lay on the ground her lower half missing, organs dragged along behind her upper body. Barbed wire wrapped around and pierced through her. A soft, piercing screech escaped her slightly open mouth, like a final scream looping forever.

Dear God. Her face was unrecognisable. A hook pierced her right eye, attached to a cable stretching into the dark. It was pulling her toward something. We both knew we had to stop it.

I looked away instinctively. This was the worst thing I’d ever seen. Lily took a few steps back and gagged.

“Jesus fuck,” she choked.

I forced myself to focus on anything else and saw a revolver clutched in the corpse’s hand. Likely organisation-issued silver bullets. Shielding my eyes, I unpeeled her still-warm fingers and took the weapon.

I felt suspended between overwhelming emotion and complete numbness. Ever since remembering Stalborn, death has taken on new meaning.

“Let’s keep moving,” Lily said once she steadied herself.

“Alright,” I said, holding the revolver out. I had no experience with firearms, but in a hallway, it wouldn’t matter.

We followed the metal wire deeper. Neither of us spoke.

My thoughts drifted to Aarna. Richard could handle himself, but Aarna had never done fieldwork. What had I pressured her into?

Gunshots suddenly exploded ahead. I flinched hard.

“Shit, that was ahead of us,” I said.

We ran. The hallway opened into a tall room lined with enclosures. Scaffolding climbed the right wall toward catwalks crossing multiple levels.

“We have to go up,” Lily said.

“Are you sure—”

A man wearing a hunter’s vest fell from above and hit the floor with a wet, heavy splat.

We climbed. The higher we went, the more flesh hung from above like meat in a slaughterhouse.

The smell was overwhelming. I felt myself slipping toward shock.

At the top, we saw two figures. One hunter swung an axe at another hunter except the second had jagged metal pieces jutting from his neck and face.

The axe-wielder swung hard. The other stepped aside and thrust his hand out. Metal cables burst from his wrist and forearm, digging into the axe-wielder and yanking her off the railing. As she fell, the cables wrapped around the railing, suspending her body midair.

The creature looked at us. Its eyes glowed orange like headlights through fog.

“HYAH!” Lily grunted, thrusting her hands out. Cables shot toward us from under its skin, but she flung the creature off the scaffolding.

I ran toward where it fell. My footsteps echoed like thunder. I found an enclosure with only a lectern. On it sat a pocket watch. I tried the door, it was locked. I fired at the glass. The bullet did nothing.

Of course. It was the vault. Why would the glass break?

Metallic booms erupted behind me. I turned to see large metallic arms, wires wrapped together, dig into the scaffolding. The creature was climbing back up, arms protruding from its back like broken wings.

I aimed at it, but my hands shook violently. Panic overwhelmed me. I fired once completely missing and dropped the gun.

“Lily!” I screamed. She stood on the staircase, trying to force the thing back down, but it wasn’t working. The creature aimed at her and shot a metal wire. As it neared her, it slowed. She was holding it back, but it shook violently.

“Hey dickhead!” I yelled. It turned its offhand toward me, and I ripped the cable out of its palm. I dove, but not fast enough, the cable grazed my thigh, slicing it open. Pain exploded through me.

“ELINAH!” Lily screamed. The cable she’d been holding slipped past her defence and plunged into her shoulder. She screamed and nearly went limp, dragged toward the creature.

Fear hit something deep inside me.

I crawled to the railing and pulled myself up. The creature reeled Lily closer. Suddenly, an axe spun through the air and embedded itself in the creature’s back.

It screeched a mixture of a man’s scream and an inhuman growl.

I saw Richard and Aarna on the far side. They were unharmed. Relief flooded me.

The cable slid out of Lily’s shoulder and retreated into the creature’s arm. She collapsed against the railing, unconscious.

“Don’t let it impale you!” I yelled.

“Wasn’t my plan!?” Richard shouted. He held a machete in one hand and another throwing axe in the other, both silver.

Aarna ran toward me. She knelt and looked at my torn pants, torn skin.

Without thinking, she took off her yellow jumper, revealing the green one beneath, and tied the yellow one around my wound. She put my arm around her shoulder.

“We have to move,” she said, stuttering with fear but still helping.

I tried to see Richard fighting the creature, but my vision blurred with adrenaline and pain.

Another screech. The catwalk shook. Aarna lost her footing, and we both fell onto the metal.

“Ahhh, dammit,” I groaned.

“Aarna, are you okay?” I said through clenched teeth.

“Yeah. I’m okay, Elijah,” she said, though her tone wasn’t convincing.

I looked across the catwalk and saw Richard crouched over an exhausted but conscious Lily. He held his machete in one hand and an adrenaline syringe in the other.

The creature began to rise again. Richard injected Lily, and she roared back to life.

Richard launched himself forward, stepping onto the railing before leaping. Lily thrust her arms out, psychically pushing him harder toward the creature.

Richard flew into the creature’s upper body. He angled his machete so it drove straight into its skull and down its spine.

The creature spun violently, its eyes flickering with light before returning to a normal human colour.

Then it went still.

Richard tumbled onto the catwalk as the creature fell off the railing, crashing to the floor below.

A few hours later, a large squad of hunters arrived and locked down the area. We were separated and underwent individual tests.

Lily spent the most time in isolation; the higher-ups heard she’d been pierced by the cable. She was the only survivor of that specific injury, so they needed to ensure she wasn’t infected like the hunter the creature took over.


“I don’t think I want to do fieldwork,” Aarna said with a nervous chuckle.

Aarna and I talked in my cubicle like normal. I sat at my desk while she leaned against the wall.

“Trust me, most of the time it’s chasing myths that are just that. This was… something else,” I said while drinking coffee.

She smiled at me. I smiled back. Aarna was a good person.

“I’ll be back in just a minute,” I said, getting up and heading to the bathroom. As I washed my hands, the water shifted—not in temperature, but texture. Something about it felt wrong. Superficial.

I looked at my reflection. Black fog lingered around the bathroom.

“Imani, are you serious? Can’t I even piss in peace?” I snapped.

Why should I expect anything else from him? He respects no timing, so why would he respect the ancient law of the bathroom: do not disturb?

A toilet flushed, and a stall door opened. Imani walked out in a fine suit. He strode casually to the sink beside me and washed his hands.

“My, my, Elijah, you have outdone yourself; you stopped that wiry parasite from getting what it wanted,” he said cheerfully.

“Yeah, I guess we did. Can you at least tell me what it wanted? Why was the stopwatch so special?” I asked.

“Not for you to know, my friend. The important thing is that you stopped it from being stolen,” he said.

He moved to the hand dryer and used it far longer than necessary.

“Okay, if you aren’t going to tell me what it does, can you at least tell me why you didn’t want it stolen?” I asked.

“Simple. It wasn’t his to steal; it’s mine. Or, more plainly… it’s yours,” he said, looking over his shoulder at me.

There's something special about waking up to those mountain views and feeling like you're tucked away from the hustle of the city while still being close to everything.

**What makes Moon Valley stand out for me:**

The community here is genuinely welcoming. You get that friendly, neighborhood vibe where people actually know their neighbors. Whether it's morning walks around the community or grabbing coffee at a local spot, there's a real sense of belonging.

The location is unbeatable. You're minutes from great dining, shopping, and entertainment, but when you come home, it feels peaceful and residential. Plus, the golf courses and parks are fantastic if you're into outdoor activities.

The homes here have character, from mid-century gems to updated properties, there's a great mix of styles that give the area personality.

**A bit about what I do:**

I'm also a Realtor specializing in Moon Valley and the surrounding areas. I've been fortunate enough to become one of the top agents in this market, and honestly, it doesn't feel like work when you're helping people discover a place you genuinely love. I know these streets, the market trends, and what makes each pocket of the neighborhood unique.

If you're considering Moon Valley or just curious about the area, happy to answer any questions! Whether you're looking to buy, sell, or just learn more about what it's like to live here, feel free to reach out or drop a comment.

Would love to hear from other Moon Valley residents too. What's your favorite thing about living here?

My wife who requested dairy free was given a roll with gluten but no dairy, a salad with balsamic vinaigrette, rice with I think braised cabbage and onions with chicken in a spicy sauce.  It was decent but very spicy, I like spicy and this was at the higher end of heat level, it also had a Nanaimo bar for her dessert.

Hey, picked up a Bambino Plus fairly cheap on marketplace, with the person saying it needed a new filter. Expected some minor adjustments due to the price but think there’s more to it. Been having a little trouble getting any water at all through to the steam wand or the head, and think there’s a blockage. We live in a very hard water area so suspect it was gotten rid of for this reason.

Pump sounds fine and the unit gets hot, after trying and failing several descale cycles plus soaking both ends in vinegar and citric acid solution, still nothing.

Some progress in that bubbles do come out of the steam wand after the 10th cycle of trying to purge it, but no proper flow.

Would love any ideas or suggestions, next step is to look at disassembly and perhaps manually priming with a baster / syringe? (See here: https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1j67ows/breville_bambino_no_water_flow_but_pump_works/ )

I’m 34, based in Pune(open to relocation), originally from the North. I work in the financial sector.

I’d call myself an ambivert — I enjoy my own space and I do enjoy  a book or a game or some series on a weekend but I also like travelling, exploring new places, and the occasional debate about football tactics over coffee. Considering Manchester United is my favourite team, discussion about a lack of DM or Amorim's tactics can last
I don’t drink or smoke, but it’s fine if you do (as long as it’s not over the top). I am a vegetarian (technically eggeterian but eggs are veg) but I am alright with whatever you want to eat. 

I also enjoy all sorts of fur babies (cats, dogs, rabbit or any other). 

I live alone and plan to continue that way for the foreseeable future, so I’d prefer someone who’s also comfortable with an independent setup. I am open to moving to other Tier 1 cities or outside India (barring Delhi and Chennai. Can't handle pollution in Delhi and heat in Chennai).

I’ve done plenty of solo trips and loved them, but it would be nice to share that happiness and experience with someone like-minded now. I’m not the party type — more into long walks, movie or book discussions, casual games like badminton or bowling, or sometimes just sleeping through a lazy day to reset.

I’m looking for someone grounded yet opinionated — a feminist who speaks her mind, takes care of herself mentally and physically, and values mutual respect and emotional balance. Ideally, someone who’s also childfree and interested in a long-term, peaceful partnership.

Not chasing perfection — just looking for genuine connection, shared values, and sanity. It's a small life, looking to enjoy it peacefully and comfortably

Our local bakery has a tip jar and asks on the POS system too. These donuts they make were all made beforehand and will sit there until someone buys them. No one made these as a special order for me. It's ridiculous!! 

I go and get a 1-hour, $80 massage and my Masseuse  sits there at the counter and says, ""oh there is just a little question on here for you to answer""... Like I'm not going to feel obligated to tip her?? I don't want her to hate it when she knows she's going to have to massage me, knowing I'm not going to tip her. 

How do I stop this madness? How do I still go to my local bakery, still order pick up pizza, grab a coffee through the drive through, and still use the same Masseuse without feeling like I'm the ass hole?",4,1763311278.0,EndTipping,11,0.75,False

Hey, picked up a Bambino Plus fairly cheap on marketplace, with the person saying it needed a new filter. Expected some minor adjustments due to the price but think there’s more to it. Been having a little trouble getting any water at all through to the steam wand or the head, and think there’s a blockage. We live in a very hard water area so suspect it was gotten rid of for this reason.

Pump sounds fine and the unit gets hot, after trying and failing several descale cycles plus soaking both ends in vinegar and citric acid solution, still nothing.

Some progress in that bubbles do come out of the steam wand after the 10th cycle of trying to purge it, but no proper flow.

Would love any ideas or suggestions, next step is to look at disassembly and perhaps manually priming with a baster / syringe? (See here: https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1j67ows/breville_bambino_no_water_flow_but_pump_works/ )

Washed my hair with a shampoo bar from Vine, and my body with a bar soap from Vine.

Scrubbed my face with a product from Vine, and moisturized with another product from Vine. Slathered on some lip balm from Vine.

Put on some tennis bracelets from Vine then took them off again because they snagged my shirt sleeves.

Dabbed on some perfume from Vine.

Put some hand jelly from Vine on my hands and brewed a big cup of coffee in my new coffee maker from Vine. I could have chosen to have tea from Vine, but decided on coffee which came from Walmart on clearance.

I'm having a lot of fun. It feels like bridging that gap between just surviving and thriving to be able to enjoy something like.

Only downside is there are a lot of smells coming from these products and they don't all go together. 😂 Definitely in my grandma era, smell wise.

the purpose of this communication is to bring awareness forward of something that should be well known but sadly isn’t. when people start to understand the extreme depravity of what’s going on and how it’s affecting every individual animal it changes how we think about the situation

this change in consciousness directly helps the animals who are innocent and voiceless. it sends them your love which helps them deal with the trauma, depression and hurt they’re feeling in the present

these animals are pure love and they’re being raped by intensely unhinged individuals across the earth

bestiality is currently out of control and has spiraled to turbulent heights in a never before seen way in its entire history

● tanzania is the worst and cruellest country for sexual relations with animals

● the main animal of choice in tanzania is the donkey

● donkeys are the main animal of choice due to their extremely docile nature

● sadly horses are also used in this way. you may think \*well why would a extremely powerful horse allow itself to be raped by a meek human being\*

would this not be highly dangerous for the offender? for this example, dario decided it would be best left to your imaginations. the information received felt unsuitable to relay at this time

● the horse is a highly spiritual animal. they're vehemently **pure** and have a strong connection and awareness to the human race

● sexual relations has gone haywire in tanzania (7,032), australia (6,011), sri lanka (4,022), united kingdom (2,060), hong kong (1,967) and france (2,050) to name just a few offenders

● distressingly kangaroos and koalas are being raped by men in the land of oz

● pigs in sri lanka are being sexually abused by men

the reason for sexual relations with animals is outright perversion, for example men who cannot secure a human sexual partner cut corners with their adult relationships by helping themselves to animals

the act of course is rape which degrades and harms the animal physically and mentally. the offenders are taking pure and kind energy from the animals by way of sexual energy exchange which enables them to feel great and gives them all sorts of healing powers that heals them on multiple levels, especially physically

in case you weren’t aware sexual relations with animals goes against universal law in a severe way and's also a heinous act which means that negative karmic consequences are enacted in an alarming manner each and every time an animal is harmed in this way

the situation is even more serious as animals can’t speak and they never gave away their permission to be violated in such a way

at this point i decided to ask dario a few questions

q: how long has sexual relations with animals been playing out for?

a: around a thousand years, but the situation is now much worse than it has ever been

a: 100% of all animals absolutely detest it. they do not like it and just want the man to finish and go. the animal is not happy for a few weeks each time after it happens and it happens to them almost every day

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

reminder: by simply knowing about this diabolical situation it directly sends the animals love that helps them with their situation. animals are voiceless and many are being sexually abused daily against their will

**q: would you like to assist further**

a: if you feel the resonance of the truth within this bulletin, please share it with all those you can

the more individuals who know, the better the situation will become. it’ll directly help the **16,232** animals who’re currently being sexually assaulted almost every day

a: pray to god, archangels and your spirit guides (please adjust accordingly to align with your own culture if relevant)

a: reiki level 2 (and above) distant healing will help enormously, especially if 100+ reiki attuned superstars joined the cause. something special will happen, it would be like waving a magic wand. it would make an amazing difference, as remember, the situation is currently at the worst level it’s ever been

if you can think of any other ways to assist, please use it. the good karma heading your way for assisting the voiceless and the pure won’t go unnoticed. you’ll be rewarded for each and every animal’s life you assist

we apologise profusely if this bulletin caused you any level of distress

1oyqb5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/comments/1oyqb5l/the_guy_i_loved_asked_me_to_let_go_of_him_and_i/,"The guy I loved asked me to let go of him, and I don’t know if I can do it. We have known each other for almost 21 months now.","TL;DR:
I met a guy, fell deeply in love, and spent almost a year building a world with him; late-night talks, weekend rides, stolen kisses. He left to fix his family’s life and asked me to let him go “for my own good.” My heart refuses to let him go.

✨ Here's the story - I met him on 30th Dec 2024. He’s a family friend who had just moved to the city and came to meet my dad. My dad asked me to pick him up, and the moment I saw him, something just… clicked. I can’t say “love at first sight” because he doesn’t believe in that, but I knew I liked him.

That Saturday night, I stayed up all night stalking his socials, I even found them - but sending a follow request at 2 AM? No way. That would have made me look like a psychopath.

The next day, we went for breakfast, followed each other on Instagram & went to watch “Animal” because he wanted to. We spent the whole Sunday together & when he left that night… my heart ached. I had only met him a day ago & yet, I already missed him.

For the next two weeks, we texted all night, sometimes till 2-3 AM. Eventually, we decided to meet for coffee. After 50 different plans & changes, I finally went to his place.

He was already waiting for me in the lift. We talked for hours about life, college, everything. Then we decided he’d cook something, and we’d have a beer… but he ended up getting Old Monk. Tipsy, we stood facing each other, and I just kissed him. We made out, and it was like fireworks.

After that, weekends became ours. I’d ride 30 kms on my scooty every weekend just to see him. I’d sneak in early to wake him at 7 AM, cuddle & fall back asleep together. We went on a couple of dates but mostly kept it secret because of my family. This went on for almost 10 months.

In Nov 2024, he came to my house for Diwali. My family discussed he was a “nice guy” & even discussed prospective rishtas for him - but not me, because they thought of him like a brother to me.

During those 4 days, something changed in me. When he left, my heart ached again. I became stubborn, asking, “What are we? Shouldn’t we have a label?” We decided to date without worrying about the future, thinking we could just enjoy being together bcz future seemed uncertain, the thought of convincing our families felt scary.

Fast forward to March 2025. His flatmate, who was also his best friend, was leaving the country for his master’s. He struggled with it and broke up with me, saying he wanted to “protect me” from the trouble he would face being alone & didn't want to make me suffer bcz of his sadness.

We were broken up for three weeks, but I still spent my birthday with him because I had plans & he felt guilty. We got back together after a week, crying and saying, “We’ll date for as long as he is here.” Another mistake.

He was planning to resign in a few months and move to a different city or back home & then we went for a trip in June, which ended abruptly because one of his family members passed away. I didn’t blame him, but the uncertainty hurt. We couldn't say our goodbyes. He said, “Long distance isn’t my cup of tea. It will lead to fights.” Yet he kissed my forehead and said, “I will come back for you, no matter what happens.”

I was ready to wait. I truly loved him. No matter how long it took. 

But after he left, my health started failing. I overthought, overanalyzed & one night had a panic attack that felt like a heart attack. I was rushed to the hospital; the doctor said it was hyperventilation syndrome. My health has been declining since.

Last night, he asked me to let go of him. His home situation is so bad that he can’t leave; he needs to fix things which will require hardwork for at least 5 years. He is already tired of all this & just wants to leave everything behind & come to me. But he can't leave his parents alone in times of difficulty. He said he loves me but doesn’t want me to wait, because that would take my life away. According to him, letting him go is the greatest form of love, to make space for someone new who can give me the love he deserves.

I don’t agree. The thought of another man disgusts me. I’ve been through so many ups and downs with him, shared so much, and loved so deeply… I can’t imagine anyone else.

I don’t know how to move on. I don't even know if I want to move on.

I’m 34, based in Pune(open to relocation), originally from the North. I work in the financial sector.

I’m pretty active — gym is part of my routine, and I enjoy trekking and hiking whenever I get the chance. I regularly plan a beach trip just to reset. Mountains are great too, but beaches win when I need to rela

I’d call myself an ambivert — I enjoy my own space and I do enjoy  a book or a game or some series on a weekend but I also like travelling, exploring new places, and the occasional debate about football tactics over coffee. Considering Manchester United is my favourite team, discussion about a lack of DM or Amorim's tactics can last
I don’t drink or smoke, but it’s fine if you do (as long as it’s not over the top). I am a vegetarian (technically eggeterian but eggs are veg) but I am alright with whatever you want to eat. 

I also enjoy all sorts of fur babies (cats, dogs, rabbit or any other). 

I live alone and plan to continue that way for the foreseeable future, so I’d prefer someone who’s also comfortable with an independent setup. I am open to moving to other Tier 1 cities or outside India (barring Delhi and Chennai. Can't handle pollution in Delhi and heat in Chennai).

I’ve done plenty of solo trips and loved them, but it would be nice to share that happiness and experience with someone like-minded now. I’m not the party type — more into long walks, movie or book discussions, casual games like badminton or bowling, or sometimes just sleeping through a lazy day to reset.

I’m looking for someone grounded yet opinionated — a feminist who speaks her mind, takes care of herself mentally and physically, and values mutual respect and emotional balance. Ideally, someone who’s also childfree and interested in a long-term, peaceful partnership.

Not chasing perfection — just looking for genuine connection, shared values, and sanity. It's a small life, looking to enjoy it peacefully and comfortably
If any of this sounds familiar to your mindset, happy to chat and see if we get along.

1oyq5uz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oyq5uz,For us early birds.,"Truly a magical time of year, the fog hugged the hills tightly this morning as I wound through the twists and bends of the hills near my home. I seemed to have been up before most on this gloomy Sunday morning. Solemnly quiet was the air, save for the sounds of my engine ricocheting off the asphalt as I carved my way into town, and the elk bugling in the distance. Quite a juxtaposition cutting through the morning still. 

The daylight woke with me as I drank my coffee, and slowly, the daytime traffic began, the birds chirping, cars honking, and people talking. In hearing this I knew my family would soon wake. So, just as fast as I arrived, I readied myself, and saddled my trusty bike. I turn the fuel petcock, and give her just a touch of choke, and just like thousands of times before, she roars to life on a half turn, as if to affirm me that the miles are just a number, and that I know I’ll arrive to my destination unperturbed. 

Into the pine laden forest we travel again, the morning fog hugging the ground tightly as the headlight beam projects a wide cone ahead. Now, on the way back in. The earth around us is awake. Squirrels scavenge, and the birds chirp, and people start their morning fires. We only stop briefly to document the scenery around us. 

Then we arrive home as the family comes to life, awake in a way that only those that live life in two wheels can understand. To those of us who ride through the seasons less travelled, I recommend starting mornings with a ride and a coffee, and coming alive by doing what makes us feel most so. And here I type this from the warmth of home. Thinking about when next I can go out and chase the sunrise.

1oyq37l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oyq37l,Morning coffee ride.,"Truly a magical time of year, the fog hugged the hills tightly this morning as I wound through the twists and bends of the hills near my home. I seemed to have been up before most on this gloomy Sunday morning. Solemnly quiet was the air, save for the sounds of my engine ricocheting off the asphalt as I carved my way into town, and the elk bugling in the distance. Quite a juxtaposition cutting through the morning still. 

The daylight woke with me as I drank my coffee, and slowly, the daytime traffic began, the birds chirping, cars honking, and people talking. In hearing this I knew my family would soon wake. So, just as fast as I arrived, I readied myself, and saddled my trusty bike. I turn the fuel petcock, and give her just a touch of choke, and just like thousands of times before, she roars to life on a half turn, as if to affirm me that the miles are just a number, and that I know I’ll arrive to my destination unperturbed. 

Into the pine laden forest we travel again, the morning fog hugging the ground tightly as the headlight beam projects a wide cone ahead. Now, on the way back in. The earth around us is awake. Squirrels scavenge, and the birds chirp, and people start their morning fires. We only stop briefly to document the scenery around us. 

Then we arrive home as the family comes to life, awake in a way that only those that live life in two wheels can understand. To those of us who ride through the seasons less travelled, I recommend starting mornings with a ride and a coffee, and coming alive by doing what makes us feel most so. And here I type this from the warmth of home. Thinking about when next I can go out and chase the sunrise. 

To some a machine, to others an irreplaceable aspect of life.

How do I stop feeling guilty?,"My LO will be 11 weeks old on Wednesday. Over the past two days I have been combo feeding her breast milk and formula, and today is the first day she is going to be fed 100% formula only. There is a reason for this extremely fast transition. She has MSPI (milk-soy protein intolerance) and other mystery intolerances to my breast milk/food in my diet that I have not been able to pinpoint. She started getting colicky when she was only about 2 weeks old, and a couple weeks later she began getting a rash all over her body and mucousy poops with small blood spots in them. I asked the pediatrician for help, he gave me a probiotic and recommended I cut dairy, did that for 3 weeks with no improvement. Afterwards I started an elimination diet where I cut out dairy, soy, egg, wheat, gluten, and beef protein. I basically ate nothing except for chicken, rice, watermelon, peas, carrots, coconut milk yogurt, and one half caff coffee with oat milk creamer per day for the past 3 weeks and it did nothing to alleviate her pain…but as soon as she got a bottle of Pepticate that I panic bought after almost an entire day of her refusing to nurse or take my pumped milk, she was finally able to eat and get some sleep. That was when I realized that our breastfeeding journey had to come to an end. 

I’m being eaten alive by the guilt of knowing that the food my body makes for my child is hurting her + that I failed to figure out the reason why and as a result she is going to miss out on all the antibodies, bonding, and health benefits from BF. Hypoallergenic formulas in the US also have some pretty bad ingredients!! It makes no sense to give the most sensitive babies the worst quality, but I digress. I’m planning on trying to wean her over to Kendamil goat once her stomach heals a little bit, but I have heard mixed reviews about how MSPI diagnosed babies handle goat’s milk so I don’t know how she will react. If that doesn’t work, I am considering ordering the Dutch Hipp HA. My fiancee has been begging me to just stop for the past 2 weeks and we’ve gotten into a couple fights about it, I just am having a very hard time letting go.

1oyq19r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oyq19r,Discouraged,"Hi everybody, 

This is Betty. She is almost 2 years old and was never socialized. My sister found her at the shelter and she was the main one that needed fostering, so she took her in. Well my sister had to go back to college and I go to college here locally, so I’ve taken over her care starting this past August. 

She’s progressed a lot. She started off in the kitchen closet, barely leaving it to eat in front of me. I started incorporating play, and eventually she explored my adjacent bedroom, and since then has made the spot under the coffee table her “bed” (she refused all other offers of beds and blankets). I have also started this program I found online called “Socialization Saves Lives” where you sit with legs extended and it gives them the opportunity to initiate touch by being lured by a Churry. She’s currently willing to walk across my knees following a Churry.

For some reason though I still feel guilty at times for keeping her inside. Inherently I understand her desire to be outdoors and it seems cruel to take that from her completely. So from time to time I have left the door opened and let her venture outside. So far she has always come back as soon as I called “Betty come!” Which I have always rewarded with tuna. But last night was different. She went outside for probably an hour, and most of the time I was still able to see her when I stepped outside and called her name. But she wouldn’t come back, until at some point I brought the tuna out and rustled the baggy the can is normally in. She then came back in when she heard me spoon some out. 

I know this post probably seems stupid, like of course cats want to be outside. But I guess deep down I was somewhat hoping she *liked* being here with me. There are so many times she’s rolling around with her belly exposed that shows she’s happy and feels safe. But last night’s escapade made me doubt that and miss having a “normal” cat who meows, rubs itself around my legs, wants pets, etc. I don’t know if she’ll ever reach that point. 

I guess I just need encouragement that I’m doing the right thing. Sometimes I just want to give her what she craves which is the outdoors—but then I also don’t want her to be hit by a car or something. I would also love to reach the point that I can take her on walks. Does anyone ever feel the same? Any advice? I’m also open to her being an indoor/outdoor cat but I don’t quite know how to start that process. ",74,1763310463.0,Feral_Cats,39,0.97,False

* 1 - 2 tsp sugar
* 1/2 tsp cinnamon
* 1/8 tsp chili powder or cayenne

I'm thinking of using ancho chili powder. I want to make up a larger batch so that I can use as much or as little as I want in my coffee.

1oyptb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/blacksabbath/comments/1oyptb8/taken_from_sharons_twitter/,Taken from Sharon's twitter,"15 November 2025
 
In response to Jim Simpson’s press release of 14 November 2025, I am enclosing his original email to Tony Iommi and my subsequent emails to Mr. Simpson. As you can see, my emails to Mr. Simpson were not threatening. I was clearly stating the facts about Black Sabbath’s legal position.
  
Regarding his claim that Big Bear Records is the “longest-running independent record label in the UK, this is a false claim. “Topic Records” is a British folk music label. It began as an offshoot of the Workers' Music Association in 1939, making it the oldest independent record label in the world. It still operates today. Big Bear is not even a Limited company and does not file open accounts in public.   
 
Simpson also states that he is ""….in the process of relaunching Big Bear Records in a new distribution partnership with Trapeze Music & Entertainment Ltd (director being John Cooper), a well-established company with a huge catalogue including the likes of Johnny Cash, Buddy Holly, Marlene Dietrich, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Digby Fairweather and hundreds of other artists. I seriously doubt that the artists he mentions, or their estates, would have authorized them to be sold in the USA.    
 
Let it be known that Trapeze Music is an “out-of-copyright” UKbased label that is in debt for £539,000 and the entertainment division is in debt for £1.442 million. A previous entity under the Trapeze banner, with the director, (being John Cooper), was Discovery Records Limited, which went into liquidation in 2018 with an estimated deficiency of £1,407,388. These artist recordings he mentions appear NOT to be out of copyright in the USA, but Trapeze sells through a us domestic import distributor called MVD who they claim inadvertently put the BLACK SABBATH recordings online digitally in the USA and then quickly withdraw them when Simpson’s lawyers were told the Black Sabbath material is not out of copyright, despite the fact they had agreed not to release them to the public without giving us 14 days prior notice.
 
A full legal opinion from Kings Council was provided to their UK lawyer. Trapeze’s owner previously ran several companies that ended up in bankruptcy. We would never have allowed any BLACK SABBATH product to be released through Big Bear Records or Trapeze Music, and at no time did Simpson ever offer the band royalties, and he has continuously refused to let Black Sabbath hear the recordings that he claims are his. Their integrity is dubious.
 
In closing, Mr. Simpson may claim that he invited me to have coffee with him on 4 July 2025 but I was out of contact which he well knew as I was at Villa Park at soundcheck all day, and I later heard that Mr. Simpson was busy that day doing a Q&A about his time managing Black Sabbath from ’68-’70 at a pub called “Ye Olde Foundry” in Dudley for personal commercial gain.
