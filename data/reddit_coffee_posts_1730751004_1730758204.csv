Looking for my partner in crime (Or just coffee) ,"Good morning/afternoon/evening r4r.

I’m a 31 year old English Teacher currently trapped in the corn maze that is Ohio, working toward my PHD little by little. I naturally love a good book  while tinkering with my own writings, but if I’m not doing that, I enjoy playing video games (Casually), skateboarding when the weather allows (badly), love a bad joke, and am always down to try something new! 

If blonde aged emos with tattoos get you going I know a guy (it’s me). If it matters to ya, I’m slim/average build, 6 ft, 12 tattoos and counting, and wear a cardigan every day to work.

1gjqr2u,https://i.redd.it/hw5mlmw9kyyd1.jpeg,My tierlist for every OI character (pre-reboot),"Honestly, one thing I find annoying about Pre-reboot Object Invasion’s writing style is that it doesn’t really bother exploring most characters and their personalities and traits. Sure, you have Skittle and Jelly Bean’s little Fun-Dip gag, Cakey and Slingshot being the most expressive characters in the show without coming off as too annoying, and Button and Notebook Paper’s friendship. But outside of that there’s a whole ton of missed potential here. Coffee and Phone, despite literally being creator and creation, have never even interacted once, Glasses’ personality and Elastic Band’s abilities go underused way too much, and Water, Dollar, WAW and Popsicle are just nothing characters, Water especially. I’m actually kind of glad that Fusion decided to cut the cast a bit and decided to focus more on the characters this time with the reboot.

1gjqq5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gjqq5o/save_yourself_dont_do_the_right_thing/,"Save Yourself, Don’t Do the Right Thing","The blood was fresh and being soaked up fairly quickly in the old shag carpet. It was a relief honestly. The blood dulled the smell of the cigarette residue that had been built up in the carpet for what I can assume to be decades.

Retched woman. I found her sprawled out on the floor with her curled gray and white hair, and wrinkled, shriveled-up body covered in liver spots. Whoever did this really wanted to get the job done. They not only slit her throat but both her wrists as well. Her children and grandkids won’t be too happy about this, but many more people will sigh, feeling an immense weight lifted off their shoulders.

Two weeks ago I was on the verge of going completely broke. This was nothing new though. Finances and I have never had a good relationship. I know I had a problem, at least half of me acknowledged it. The other half kept spinning that roulette wheel and betting on that one horse to beat the odds. I was always close, but not close enough. I was counting down the dollars at the grocery store, but being careful as to not forget the tax. I refused to be that person who would have to put some food back while checking out. “I think I got this one” I told myself. $45 with some wiggle room. That’ll last me… maybe five days? If I’m lucky?

I was walking through the bread aisle when an old woman with a back hump was pushing a shopping cart in the other direction. As we passed each other, I noticed not only the waft of cigarette smell, but something had fallen to the ground in my peripheral view. I looked down and saw that the old lady had dropped some money. As I went to pick it up, I saw it was two, crumbled-up $100 bills. I felt in my chest what I can only describe as getting giddy like a child. I had the immediate instinct to shove it into my jacket pocket and walk away. But, I didn’t. Caution override the desire of thievery. 

It’s $200. I’m sure she would report the money missing to the grocery store just to be safe, and they would catch me on camera taking it. There was one of those black orb-looking cameras on the ceiling in the aisle right next to me where the blacked-out cover of it was to prevent people from knowing where the camera was looking. Also, the bills were in rough condition. What if she just managed to save enough money for a full grocery shopping trip for once? She very well could be broke like me. For some reason, this oldie hit a soft spot in me.

“Excuse me ma’am, I think you dropped this.” She turned to me to see if I was talking to her or someone else. She had bright turquoise eyes. I’ve never seen eyes that color before. They were very pretty, but they sent a shiver down my spine because of how odd they were. I noticed I had paused too long looking at her eyes.

“....Sorry, I think you dropped some money.” I handed her the $200.

She was shocked. “Oh, thank you very much. How did I manage to do that? Thank you.” I nodded, and as I began to walk away, she continued.

“Wait, I have something for you.” She reached into a small purse, and with the crumbled bills I handed back to her, she handed me two more crisp $100 bills. $400 total. I assumed she was not aware of what she was doing.

“Ma’am, no need.” I put my hand out to gently push her hand back.

“I’m aware,” she said.

“And now it’s yours.” She re-extended her hand, now eagerly getting me to take the money. 

I replied, “That’s very kind of you, but there’s no way I could take this. That’s a lot of money.”

She replied, “You could have walked away with what you found. But you didn’t. Now, you have double.” There was a brief pause while I contemplated taking the money or not.

“If I needed it I wouldn’t be giving it to you” she said. I took the money from her.

“Thank you,” I replied.

“You don’t know how much this means to me.”

She looked at my shopping cart which so far only had a loaf of bread and a can of baked beans. “It looks like you have some shopping to do” she said with a smile before turning around and pushing her cart away.

If you know the mind of an addict, I’m sure this comes as no surprise. I spent $150 on groceries and the rest I immediately went to the casino that is conveniently seven minutes away from my apartment. The next horse race was the next day, but I couldn’t wait. I knew I was going to make it big this time. Screw the tables, I didn’t want to waste my money having to tip the croupier. I went first to the slot machines. I was going to spend maybe $20, $50 at most if I didn’t win, which I thought at least I’d make a little. But only half an hour later I realized I spent $200. I got caught up in it. I needed to get my head in the game. 

I went up to the “self-serve” roulette table. A chair was open. Six other people sat around the wheel staring as it went round and round. Everybody anticipating that big break. That spin concluded. Some people groaned, some said nothing. I looked at my digital screen. Normally with roulette I like to spread my chances out; pick multiple numbers, overlap, etc. But something was telling me to put my whole $50 left on number seven. The guy sitting next to me saw my bet and scoffed.

“I’ve been losing money here for an hour. You’re not going to win that bet” he said. He noticed the others at the table were looking at us. He grinned.

“If it lands on seven, I’ll give you an extra $50. If you lose, you owe me $50” he said. There was a short pause. 

“Same here. No way you’re winning that” a woman sitting across the table said.

“I will too” the man sitting next to her said. All six people were putting in $50 each. An extra $300 on top of my incoming winnings. I couldn’t resist.

“Alright” I said confidently. My heart sank. My face went flush. What have I done? The roulette ivorine was released, and round it went. I glanced back and forth between the wheel and the others. They were glancing back and forth between the wheel and me. It landed. Eight. It landed on eight. They cheered. Fight or flight kicked in. I reached into my jacket pocket. I decided I was going to pretend to get the money out of my wallet and then book it out of the casino. 

When I opened my wallet, expecting nothing, were multiple crisp $50 bills. Seven of them. I tried to hide my shock and play it cool. I started to hand out the $50 bills to each of them. I sat back down. I was left again with $50. I… did seven. I put it all on seven again. I don’t know why, but I did. Everyone at the table laughed at me. Pity laughed. 

“You must really have an issue” one of the guys said. The wheel spun. Everyone at the table was grinning, watching the wheel, waiting to make fun of me again. It landed. It was seven. The $50 that appeared in my wallet turned into $250. I made my money back. Everyone looked at me in utter disbelief. Again, I don’t know what took over me, but I put the whole $250 on eight. Now everyone was getting really irritated.

“Are you kidding me?” one guy said.

“This is ridiculous” another woman said.

The wheel spun. There was an anticipation at that table I had never experienced before. It landed. It was eight. I had won another $250. I had never won a single dollar gambling before. Not a penny. Everyone got pissed; in general, at the circumstance. Not at me. Thank god. Three people at the table got up and walked away angry. The force that had overcome me “told” me to leave the table. So, I did. I walked out of the casino. Normally I would keep going, but something was telling me to stop. Something.

I entered my little apartment and tossed my keys onto the kitchen table. Very cliche for a person struggling with money, I looked at the two overdue credit card bills and electric bill notice also sitting on the table. I sat down. What just happened? Finally winning with anything involving gambling didn’t feel as good as I thought it would. Facing again the fact that I am an addict, how was I even able to walk away from the table without spending all my winnings away?

I honestly became alarmed when I felt the urge to deposit my winnings at the bank tomorrow to start paying off my debts. Responsibility was a new desire for me. I got up and grabbed my jacket and keys. I felt antsy all of a sudden. I decided to go grab a coffee at the coffee shop across the street. 

I got my iced Americano and decided to stand outside the coffee shop to feel the breeze. After a couple of minutes, an older woman with a cane started to walk up the sidewalk. It was weird. I hadn’t seen her cross the street or walk up from down the way. I realized after a moment that it was the same woman from the grocery store.

“Oh hello there. What a pleasant surprise. How are you?” The woman said this to me as though we had known each other for years. Her smile was kind, but her turquoise eyes showed no emotion.

“…Good, just grabbing some coffee. How ‘bout you?” I said.

“Me too. An iced Americano always makes my day” she said. She stopped in front of me and continued.

“How has the rest of your day been?” referencing since we met at the grocery store.

“Good. Thanks again” I replied. The woman grinned.

“Be careful now. Nothing stays for long. The good and the bad come and go” she said. I assumed she was making a corny old-person comment to spend the money she gave me wisely. I pretended her comment wasn’t annoying and arrogant, like how people want the barista to see and thank them for putting money in the tip jar. I gave her a “warm” smile.

She walked around me. I heard the little metal bells the coffee shop put on top of the door jingle as she walked in. I turned around curious to see the reaction of the employees to her, if she was a regular or not so I would know if I would see her again. But, she wasn’t there. The coffee shop wasn’t big. You can see the whole front of the coffee shop through the window and the door. She was nowhere to be found. There’s no possible way she could have gone anywhere else in the second she went around me to enter the coffee shop. She was gone.

Oddly enough, I felt pretty calm. I could tell this reaction was definitely from this new force or state I’ve been in since the casino earlier. It was bizarre, but I didn’t feel the need to question what I just witnessed. At least not right then. I sipped my last bit of coffee and crossed the street back to my apartment. Again, I hung up my jacket and put my keys on the table. It was only 3:00pm, but I suddenly became so drained. Just utterly tired. I showered and went to bed.

I woke up at 7:00am. I felt refreshed. I got up and had my cup of coffee while watching birds and passerbyers outside my living room window. I had some cereal, showered, and headed out to the bank to deposit my winnings from the day before. Waiting in line at the bank, I felt a wave of nervousness come over me. I didn’t know what was happening. I kept going back and forth between feeling really good and pure dread. 

When it was my turn, I handed the teller my deposit slip and took my wallet out to hand her the money. What I found was not only the winnings, but an extra $50. I paused for a moment. Am I becoming extremely forgetful? The teller waited.

“Sir, are you making a deposit?” she said.

“Yes. Sorry. Here” I replied. I handed her the amount I won. I kept the new $50 bill. I left the bank. Off to the race track I went.

It wasn’t busy. Only a quarter of the people that normally fill the betting room were there. I looked at the horses racing that day. I never understood why they gave the horses weird names that sound like a child from the 1940’s make them up. “Flash Trixie?” “Corn-of-Copia?” What even is that? The force from yesterday washed over me again. My focus went toward horse #7. I didn’t bother to catch its name. The odds were in the middle. The horse had a pretty average record. Not great, but not bad. I went to the counter.

I kept it short. “On #7. First place” I said and slid my cash over to the betting teller. Dead-eyed, he took my money. As the cash left my hand, I saw what I handed over. Five $100 bills. I thought I just deposited $500 at the bank? I wanted to stop him, but I couldn’t. At that brief moment, I was unable to talk or move. He handed me a ticket and I just walked away. I went outside and stood there, watching the track as the horses lined up ready to go. An overly confident man stood near me. He turned when he saw me walk up to watch.

“Which ones you got?” he said, meaning what was my bet.

“#7” I said.

“What place?” he asked.

“First” I replied. He scoffed.

“I mean, I guess you could have chosen worse. Good luck” he said. I ignored him.

The bell rang and the horses were off. Only a couple of the jockeys kept back to conserve energy. Most of the horses started at full force. I could feel the ground vibrate from the stands from the galloping. Though the speed was incredible, there wasn’t much movement. All the horses kept their places where they started. Then, #8, something along the lines of “Blitz of Coffee” charged forward to the head of the pack, maintaining first place. #7 remained toward the back, maybe third from last.

“Oh geez. You’re not doing too good buddy” the guy said to me. I ignored him again. The race was maybe half done. Then, #7 got some wind in its sails. It pushed forward. Third from last, fifteenth, twelve, eighth, then third place.

“I put #8 on first” the man said.

“It looks like it’s gonna take it home”

Inch by inch, the horses about 80% done, #7 got into second place. My heart began to pound. They were in the final stretch. They were going and going. #7 kept pushing. And then… they were done. #8 crossed the finish line in first place. #7 placed second maybe one hoof away from #8. The man next to me cheered and waved his ticket in the air.

“Yes. Yes. That’s how you do it.”

He turned to me. “Maybe next time bud.” He went inside to collect his winnings. As he was entering the door to the betting room, two tall, broad muscular men and a short man in a suit walked out, coming toward me. When they got to me, the short man looked at me as though he was waiting for me to do something.

“...Hi?” I said to him.

“Well?” the short man said. There was a pause.

“Pay up” the man said, irritated.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about” I replied. The man scoffed and looked down, pinching the bridge of his nose, becoming more irritated.

“Pay up. You lost. That was the deal. You owe two-grand” he said. I was shocked.

“What?” I said.

“What are you talking about? I bet $50… or $500. No strings attached.” The man clearly had enough of me.

“Alright, let’s go. Inside.” As the man said that, the two bigger men started to walk toward me. I didn’t know what was going on. I bolted. I didn’t even look behind me to see if they were running after me or not. I just kept running. I got in my car and sped home.

I rushed into my apartment and locked the regular lock and the two deadbolts on my door. I just stood there for a minute, processing everything. I thought I must be mentally deteriorating. I’m imagining money switching amounts within the blink of an eye. I wasn’t remembering doing certain transactions or bets. I needed to see a doctor immediately, but this is the U.S. healthcare system. I didn’t know if I had the money to do so. I didn’t need any more debt.

I went online and paid my electric bill just to give me some sort of comfort in the moment. I checked my bank account, it showed that I did in fact deposit the money I knew I deposited, so that was good at least. I then sat at my kitchen table for about two hours going back and forth between fiddling around with apps on my phone and watching the door. I wanted to make sure the guys at the racing track didn’t know where I lived. I think my brain was trying to protect me from the trauma of all of this by having me suddenly become exhausted from the anxiety, and shut down. I quickly fell asleep.

The nightmare I had was surreal to say the least. I was in a pitch-black room. Or black space. It didn’t feel exactly like a room. I was able to stand on a solid floor or ground, but it still felt like endless darkness. No actual floor, walls, or ceiling. About twenty feet in front of me stood the old woman who had given me the money, who I had seen three times now, including this nightmare. She just stared at me. She stared at me with those bizarre turquoise eyes. It felt like an eternity but it must have been only five seconds.

She extended her cupped hand to reveal a small, black kitten. It must have been only a few days old. It was squealing like newborn kittens do, wanting its mother or to be fed. I hesitated for a moment, but the squealing wouldn’t stop. I didn’t know why the old woman wasn’t doing anything about it. She just held the kitten forward, wanting me to take it. A nurturing part of myself took over, so I extended my cupped hand. Without either the old woman or I moving from our places, the black kitten appeared in my hand.

Still squealing, I held it close. “Shhhh, it’s okay” I said to it. I held it close to my chest and began to gently pet it with my other hand. The kitten gradually became quiet and started purring. I looked back up at the old woman. She was still just staring at me.

After a moment, the kitten went silent. It must have fallen asleep. Then, it happened. The fire. My hands began to burn. The kitten had self-combusted. It started screaming a vocalization of pain I had never heard before. A scream I couldn’t recognize as a human or non-human animal. It was warped. It sounded like more than one living thing screaming in utter pain. I dropped the kitten and it hit the floor. I felt horrible for dropping it, but my hands were literally burning from it. It continued to scream. I looked up again at the old woman, she was now smiling. Grinning.

The kitten became silent once again, and the fire burned out. Its charred body sat there lifeless, smoldering. Once again, I looked up, and the old woman’s face now appeared maybe an inch in front of mine. This woke me. I jolted up in my bed in a sweat. The nightmare had felt so real. So unnerving. It was the most terrifying thing I have ever experienced.

I took a moment to gather myself before getting out of bed with some deep breathing. I showered and then made some coffee. I sat at my kitchen table still collecting myself. I decided I needed to get out and move around. Maybe get some more coffee across the street to get my dopamine levels high. I walked over to my window to see if the coffee shop was busy or not. I froze. In front of the coffee shop, a man was talking with the same old woman. The feeling that had overtaken me previously before was now panic. The old woman reached into her purse and began to hand the man money. I needed to intervene.

I opened the window and began to yell. “Hey. Hey man. Don’t do it. Don’t talk with her. She’s not ok. She’s trying to trick you. Walk away.” The man looked up at me alarmed and confused. The old woman looked up at me with a subtle yet intense anger. I continued.

“It’s not safe. Don’t do it. Go away. Now.”

The man looked away from me and started to walk backward for a moment, looking at the old woman just as startled as he was looking at me. Then he turned around and speed-walked away. The old woman now turned fully facing my direction, holding the same, angry look. She just stood there, staring at me. I quickly closed the window. As I looked back down in front of the coffee shop, the old woman had disappeared. As I turned around, I saw something on the kitchen table where I had been sitting. I walked over to the table. It was a wrinkled $1 bill with multiple brown, splotchy stains all over it.

I’m not religious. I’m not spiritual. I don’t know if I would consider myself agnostic, or even atheist. I do however believe, as many would agree, that there are some things that simply can’t be explained by (though legitimate) scientific processes. It was clear that something was deeply wrong here. I could continue to let things spiral, or I can try and stop this now while I have control over my own life. Control over the parts of my life I haven’t given up on my own.

I’m not going to accept it, and she’s not here with me at least visibly to hand it back to her. So, I decided to burn it. The easiest way to destroy it. I grabbed a lighter out of a drawer in the kitchen, lit the dollar bill on fire, and tossed it into the metal basin of my kitchen sink. It burned, and then, nothing. Nothing in particular happened besides the dollar turning to ash. I looked around my apartment. Nothing. I saw nothing change, and I felt nothing change. I washed the ashes down the drain.

Three knocks were made on my door. I grabbed a kitchen knife nearest to me. I looked through the peephole, no one was standing there. Were they waiting for me around the corner? I decided the best bet was, even if it left me vulnerable, to open my door wide, wait a moment to see if anyone lunges expecting me to walk out, and then run out with my knife. One, two, three. I opened the door. Nothing. I rushed out with the knife and frantically looked back and forth toward both sides of the hallway. No one.

I looked down and saw a square envelope on the ground. I bent down and picked up the envelope. The front was blank. I went back into my apartment and quickly locked the door. I opened the envelope and pulled out what seemed to be a page torn out of a small notebook. It read:

“She got me too - 137 \[redacted\] St.”

Truly, reading that, I felt less alone. Though the overall situation was still fucked, if this person was being honest, they were also going through something the old woman had done to them. If it was a trap, then I shouldn’t go to the address at all, right? Especially not right now, when they are expecting me. However, I knew I couldn’t wait for things to get worse. My reality was being distorted. I needed to act while I could. I grabbed my keys, put my jacket on, and put the knife in the inner pocket. I would go to the address now.

I pulled up to the address parking across the street. It was a fairly plain one-floor home. Light beige-painted brick with some grey siding. White garage doors. Some bushes near the front windows seemed only partially trimmed. One cheap rainbow was in the dirt where the bushes were planted, blowing in the breeze. I walked up the short, worn asphalt driveway to the front door. Before knocking, I tried to see into the windows from where I was standing, but it was too dark inside. I knocked, three times. No one answered. I knocked again. No one answered. I stood there for a moment, thinking what to do next. I put my ear up to the door to see if I could hear anyone inside, doing anything at all. It was silent. I tried the doorknob. As though it was well-oiled, the turn of the knob made its clicking sound and the door slid slightly open. It was as though the door was telling me “Please, come in.”

I carefully took a few steps inside. “Hello?” I called out. No one responded. There was a hallway in front of me lined with family photos on each side. From where I stood I couldn’t make out the faces in the pictures. The hallway led to what I partially could see as a vinyl-floored kitchen with old wooden cabinets. To my left was a hallway with dark green carpeting that I’m assuming led to bedrooms. To my right was an entranceway to a room that bent around the left corner. I would try there first.

I slowly walked in. When I could fully see the room, I stopped and took it in. The room smelled of cigarettes. To my right, there was an old behemoth of a TV maybe from the 1990’s that was turned off, sitting on a TV stand that had a doily tablecloth draped over it. To my left was an armchair with a TV stand next to it with a remote sitting on top. I couldn’t make out the armchair color. Dark olive green? Off-brown? Laying on the ground in front of the armchair, sprawled out, was the old lady.

The blood was fresh and being soaked up fairly quickly in the old shag carpet. Where the blood didn’t create a shade of crimson, the carpet matched the light beige of the outside of the house. It was a relief honestly. The blood dulled the smell of the cigarette residue that had been built up in the carpet for what I can assume to be decades. Whoever did this really wanted to get the job done. They not only slit the old woman’s throat but both her wrists as well. Her children and grandkids, and others I assume were in the photos in the entrance hallway, won’t be too happy about this; but many more people will sigh, feeling an immense weight lifted off their shoulders.

I heard something, what sounded like a wooden door from the direction of the bedrooms hallway closed. I began to hear light footsteps on the carpet. I bolted out of there, out the front door which I left open, to my car, and sped down the road not looking back.

Two weeks had gone by. I read online from a local news outlet that the police found the scene at the old woman’s house and that the investigation is ongoing. In any other circumstance, I would have reported it to the authorities, especially as I didn’t want to be framed for something I didn’t do. But, this was not a murder. This was someone who put an end to a malevolent force. How would I be able to explain any part of what I went through to the police anyway? I would not only be charged with murder but most likely thrown in a psychiatric ward for an even longer time than I would have serving time in a regular prison. I thought if the police were to arrest me, so be it. Till then, I was a free man. Free of what the old woman was doing and was planning to do to me. Going forward, I told myself I would not do the right thing. I would not return dropped money. I would not take it either. Dropped money, helping an elderly person cross the street, it’s simply not happening. I’m not going to be the good guy or the bad guy.

I started going to recovery meetings to address my gambling addiction, and I already noticed my life starting to improve. For once in my life I started to be more confident in myself and my abilities. I even applied for a job that not only paid more but aligned with my passions and interests. I got an offer and I let them know I could start the following week. 

I woke up on a Sunday feeling refreshed. I got up and made some coffee and sat near the window to watch people pass by. The wind was making the trees sway, and the leaves rushed down the sidewalk. The coffee shop across the street was moderately busy with people lining up inside to escape the cold and warm their hands with a mug of the shop’s fresh brew. I finished my cup of coffee and went over to put it in the sink. When I placed my cup in, I saw something crumbled up sitting in the drain. I used my index and middle fingers and successfully pulled it out. Once it was in my hand, I unfolded what appeared to be a piece of paper, which I then discovered to be a $1 bill.",1,1730757985.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Ben Sasse was angry.

It was the spring of 2024, and the University of Florida’s new Hamilton Center for Classical and Civic Education was getting off the ground. Sasse, then the university’s president, was a self-described “zealot” of the center, a Republican-backed venture to teach students about the Western canon and civil discourse.

But the rollout was hitting roadblocks. Several graduate students had complained that liberal-arts faculty were targeting them for affiliating with the Hamilton Center. There were murmurs that humanities departments would block its curricular proposals. The center’s director later described some professors’ conduct as “abuses.”

So Sasse spoke to David Richardson, then dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. According to two academic leaders who received nearly identical accounts of the conversation, Sasse gave the dean an ultimatum: Deal with it, or he would absorb the liberal-arts college into the Hamilton Center. In one of those accounts, Sasse said Richardson’s job was on the line.

A third academic leader said that all they could disclose about the exchange was that it was “unpleasant.”

Sasse’s ultimatum was at odds with the Hamilton Center’s original pitch as an independent academic unit — one that would collaborate with UF’s liberal-arts college. The center would “build on existing strengths,” its inaugural director said.

But for most of the last academic year, the Hamilton Center was locked in a behind-the-scenes turf war with the college. The center said faculty members waged an active campaign against it, stifling its progress and discriminating against its students. Some liberal-arts faculty countered that the center was duplicating their established departments’ offerings and shirking typical university protocols.

The clash culminated in a [university investigation](https://www.chronicle.com/article/u-of-florida-investigates-whether-professors-interfered-with-western-civ-center) into whether six liberal-arts faculty members had “interfered” with the Hamilton Center — a probe that threatened disciplinary action up to termination. *The Chronicle’s* reporting is based on over a dozen interviews with university officials and rank-and-file faculty, and scores of emails and documents obtained through public-records requests and those involved.

Florida is among half a dozen states where civics schools and centers with Republican ties have sprung up, envisioned as an antidote to concerns that left-leaning humanities professors are turning away from Western thought and that conservative scholars are underrepresented. National faculty advocates have sounded alarms about the new units, which they see as a troubling injection of political influence into teaching.

Sasse’s conversation with Richardson, in which the then-president threatened to trample on UF’s existing liberal-arts programs, encapsulates professors’ fears about the worst-case scenario. So does what happened next.

As some liberal-arts faculty see it, the Hamilton Center’s opaque origins tarnished it from the start.

The center wasn’t UF’s idea. A little-known group called the Council on Public University Reform hired the former chief of staff of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis to lobby for the center’s creation, [The Chronicle reported last year](https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-a-center-for-civic-education-became-a-political-provocation?sra=true).

The [initial proposal](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25262638-hamilton-center_s-initial-proposal?responsive=1&title=1) for the center argued that the fundamental mission of higher education — to seek truth — was threatened by “cancel culture and uniformity of opinion on campus.” It called for a “robust and fiercely independent center” at UF that fostered “political and intellectual diversity” and a “traditional liberal education in the Great Books that form the foundation of Western intellectual tradition.”

The Hamilton Center — named for the founding father — would exist outside any departments or colleges and offer its own courses and interdisciplinary degree programs, per the initial proposal. A board of advisers would provide a list of initial faculty hires to the university’s Board of Trustees, which would make final selections. If the center’s faculty were to be hired through existing departments, the proposal said, “the result would be a replication of what already exists.”

After the former DeSantis aide delivered the proposal to the university in January 2022, a lengthy deliberation ensued. Joseph Glover, the then-provost, argued the proposal laid out “a conservative agenda to influence the curriculum” and did “not align well” with administrative and faculty governance structures. Edits were made, the proposal was OK’d, and by July, the center had been established, had a director, and was equipped with a $3 million start-up injection from the Legislature.

The Hamilton Center entered UF in a period of transition. Kent Fuchs, then the president, and Glover were on their way out. Sasse, who succeeded Fuchs in February 2023, became the center’s biggest champion, jockeying to fast-track its development. Less than four months after taking office, he replaced the center’s inaugural director with William Inboden — a close friend of 30 years and a historian of the American presidency and the Cold War at the University of Texas at Austin. Sasse, a former Republican U.S. senator from Nebraska, also leveraged his political acumen with the Florida Legislature to bolster the center’s recurring state funding to $10 million. He even co-taught a course at the center, “The American Idea,” last spring.

While building up the center, he also rejected the notion that it was a partisan project. “It’s just classically liberal,” Sasse said in June of this year. “It’s not right of center. We’re not interested in your politics.…We’re wrestling with big questions here, and political indoctrination is boring.” He also described the center’s broad disciplinary lens as a remedy for the “nichification” of humanities scholarship.

Not all faculty were convinced. [Some still feared](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25262634-faculty-fears-report?responsive=1&title=1) the Hamilton Center was a Trojan Horse for the state’s conservative agenda and would siphon resources from existing units. A few months after the center was established, an [anonymous swath](https://fora.aa.ufl.edu/docs/78/2023-2024/Report%20of%20the%20Ad%20Hoc%20Task%20Force%20on%20Shared%20Governance%20draft%20with%20survey%20results-Final.pdf) of liberal-arts and law professors told the Faculty Senate that they feared the center was a “shadow college” meant to replace humanities departments without faculty input, and now regarded university officials who helped in its creation as “agents of the state.”

Last fall, the center offered 10 courses and housed more than a dozen faculty and staff members. But Republican power brokers have higher aspirations for the center. Beginning in 2025, the center is required by law to report its progress toward becoming a fully fledged school — Hamilton College — within the university. To get majors off the ground by 2025, approvals needed to begin in the spring of 2024 and would require the support of departments where there may be curricular overlap.

In other words: The Hamilton Center had to convince some of its biggest skeptics in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to sign off.

When Inboden, the Hamilton Center’s new director, presented to liberal-arts faculty about the center’s two inaugural majors — Great Books and Ideas, and Philosophy, Politics, Economics, and Law — he was met with silence and “blank stares,” according to a faculty member in attendance.

Later, an associate dean relayed to a Hamilton Center associate director that humanities departments would be “upset” if the majors were approved.

Then, when two Hamilton Center courses came up for review by the university’s General Education Committee, its co-chair — a classics professor — subverted the standard process. The co-chair asked at least two humanities department heads to evaluate whether the center’s courses overlapped with their departments’ existing offerings. But the General Education Committee wasn’t supposed to have authority over such consultations.

The fact that humanities chairs got involved at that stage angered Inboden, who later called the decision a “deliberate violation” of usual curricular protocols, “despite being strongly urged against doing so by multiple senior officials in the provost’s office.”

Meanwhile, Hamilton Center officials had been talking to humanities graduate students over several months about their interest in the center’s Graduate Fellows program. Those conversations revealed concerns about facing backlash from their home departments, including English, history, and anthropology.

One graduate student believed that if her home department were to find out about her Hamilton Center ties, “she would lose important friends, mentors, and allies necessary for her to pursue academic excellence,” according to an email from Inboden to Sasse describing the students’ complaints.

Another student said that his department had “many faculty members who hate the Hamilton Center and would not be happy at all should a student affiliate themselves” with it. The student also thanked the center’s academic specialist for meeting with him at an off-campus coffee shop, “away from people who might see us.”

A third student said his department “has essentially dissociated from him.”

A separate complaint suggested that, in one case, a faculty member had acted on their biases. A prospective doctoral student told his mentor, who had recently been hired by the Hamilton Center, that the history department’s graduate coordinator had rejected his transfer request to UF. Moreover, the student claimed he was told that his mentor would “not be able to be involved” in his research in “any way” because she was a Hamilton Center faculty member.

Inboden was “pretty shocked to hear about the abuses that came to light in the past week,” he told Richardson, the liberal-arts dean, in an email at the time. “I was very familiar with the vocal opposition to the Hamilton Center expressed by many \[College of Liberal Arts and Sciences\] faculty but had not realized that in some cases it extended to targeting graduate students and applicants,” Inboden said. “Hopefully further investigation will provide the full picture.”

As the Hamilton Center’s grievances grew, Sasse gave Richardson the ultimatum, threatening to dissolve the liberal-arts college unless his faculty stopped meddling with the center. Once Sasse got involved, one faculty member said, the dynamic between the liberal-arts college and the Hamilton Center “became a whole different animal.”

One academic leader who received an account of the conversation wrote at the time that Sasse planned to follow through on his threat if anyone in the college either criticized the Hamilton Center or insisted that its curricular proposals go through regular university procedures, according to email records. That faculty member didn’t respond to an interview request.

Jon Sensbach, chair of the history department, told *The Chronicle* that he spoke with two people with direct knowledge of Sasse’s exchange with Richardson and that Sasse had been “livid.” He declined to publicly identify the sources because they feared professional repercussions.

Whether or not Sasse planned to follow through on the threat, “it seems to have served as a way to intimidate the dean into taking drastic steps,” Sensbach said.

Neither Richardson nor Sasse responded to *The Chronicle’s* interview requests or an emailed list of questions, including ones about details of their conversation. A university spokesperson also didn’t answer questions about what Sasse said.

The exchange quickly became the center of gossip among faculty. At a Faculty Senate meeting in March, a philosophy professor asked whether humanities departments would be “siphoned off” into the Hamilton Center. “I’m hoping that this is a silly rumor that has no basis in fact,” the professor said, “but God knows what might be going on.”

J. Scott Angle, the provost, responded that while there was a “quite a dynamic environment of events” between the center and the liberal-arts college that have “kicked off these wildfires,” plans for a merger were “not going anywhere.” But with Sasse, Angle continued, “literally everything is on the table.”

Meanwhile Richardson, who was no stranger to [controversies over academic freedom](https://www.chronicle.com/article/u-of-florida-dean-says-he-was-directed-to-reject-professors-request-to-testify-against-the-state?sra=true), was trying to do damage control.

“The rumor you are hearing is completely false,” the dean wrote in response to another concerned professor. Then Richardson told his four associate deans that if any of them “implied or touched on this idea with anyone outside of the college office it needs to be corrected.”

“I hope none of you were the source of statements that might have led to those rumors,” he wrote in an email.

Either way, Sasse had put Richardson under the gun.

The dean “fully understood the president’s reaction” to the graduate students’ complaints and shared his “anger and determination to stop the causative behavior,” he told Inboden in an email. “We are beginning those corrections.”

Within days of talking to Sasse, Richardson put in place plans to ensure faculty members’ cooperation with the center.

He scheduled emergency meetings for March 2 — a Saturday — with the associate deans and seven humanities chairs to discuss “the general range of their faculty’s thoughts” on the Hamilton Center’s curriculum and if they were aware of “any unprofessional mentoring of graduate students” regarding the center.

Coming out of the meetings, some felt targeted. John A. Palmer, chair of the philosophy department. wrote in an email afterward that he was “frankly, offended at being cast as obstructionist.”

“Not that I imagine anyone will care,” he told an associate dean, to whom Richardson had just assigned all future curricular matters involving the Hamilton Center. Center leaders, Palmer continued, “should be more careful about bad-mouthing UF faculty who have been making genuine efforts since before their arrival at UF to be cooperative with the Hamilton Center.”

Despite the behind-the-scenes friction, Richardson told Sasse in a written debrief of the meetings that “all chairs were forthcoming and reported that they would cooperate” with the Hamilton Center on curricular matters and “correcting issues with graduate mentoring.” He reiterated: “I fully share the president’s displeasure.”

The dean would get those promises in writing.

Around 9 p.m. after the Saturday meetings, the seven humanities chairs were directed to sign pledges to cooperate with the center, including giving approvals for its two planned majors. They had less than a week to comply. “I know it’s a tight turnaround,” the associate dean — Richardson’s newly tapped Hamilton Center liaison — told the chairs. “I again appreciate your cooperation.” They could modify the pledge template, the associate dean said, “but the message of supporting/not objecting should be clear.”

The [pledge template](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25262641-pledge-to-cooperate?responsive=1&title=1) included this suggested language: “We believe that the Hamilton Center curriculum will provide a unique opportunity for students interested in these areas and will complement our department’s offerings nicely. We have no objection to the implementation of these courses and degrees.” The template also encouraged chairs to “fully support” having the center’s faculty serve on graduate committees for master’s and doctoral students.

That Saturday night marked the first time that Sensbach, the history chair, had seen the Hamilton Center’s official degree proposals, he told *The Chronicle*, so he felt “ill-prepared to comment” on the curriculum. During a meeting the following week with department colleagues, he acknowledged the “stark choice” between doing a thorough review and facing possible consequences if they didn’t sign the pledge.

“They agreed we needed to do that,” Sensbach said.

All seven chairs [submitted their pledges](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25262635-caveats?responsive=1&title=1) by the five-day deadline — with some caveats. Only one chair used the draft template. Two omitted language that would have endorsed having Hamilton faculty members serve on their departments’ graduate committees. Five stipulated that they would cooperate with the center as long as its efforts went through “official channels” and “well-established procedures.”

In the midst of that frenzy, three of the department chairs got another message: Richardson had placed them under investigation.

The English, history, and anthropology chairs, as well as the departments’ graduate coordinators, faced allegations that they had “interfered” with the Hamilton Center. The notices cited university policies regarding [academic freedom](https://hr.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-2024-UFF-UF-Collective-Bargaining-Agreement.pdf) and “[disruptive behavior](https://policy.ufl.edu/regulation/1-008/),” violators of which face [disciplinary action](https://policy.ufl.edu/regulation/7-048/) up to termination.

Sensbach said that being asked to sign an “oath of fealty” to the Hamilton Center while the threat of termination “hung over my head” amounted to “arm-twisting.”

“I was being asked to conform to some policy or some ideological position that was being imposed from several layers above,” he said. “There was no question in my mind about what I was being forced to do.”

Sensbach said the 11-week investigation was “the most stressful time” in his 26-year tenure at UF. He constantly feared the university was monitoring his emails. He had trouble sleeping.

The history chair wasn’t a foe of the Hamilton Center. The scholar of colonial America and the American Revolution didn’t think it was a problem that the center’s curricular offerings overlapped with his department.

But he understood the more critical views. The university’s humanities departments have had to “scratch and scramble” to hire faculty in recent years, he said, whereas the center had a “lavish” $10-million recruitment stipend from the state. The history department’s entire budget is $4 million.

A “jealousy” toward the center brewed, he said.

“There was a sense that the Hamilton Center and its priorities were being floated ahead of long-standing departments who have been teaching all kinds of subjects, including Western civilization, for decades,” he said. “It’s clear that the Hamilton Center was moving ahead without anybody else’s input. That generated a lot of resentment.”

Now Sensbach felt that resentment was being pinned on him.

The investigation concerned whether Sensbach and five other faculty members had “engaged in actions or inactions which impaired, interfered with, or obstructed the ability of students to participate in academic programs” or “faculty members’ ability to teach and/or advise students” within said programs, according to the notices they received.

It’s not clear why the history department was targeted, though Sensbach believes one driver may have been the complaint last spring from the prospective graduate student whose transfer application was rejected.

The student’s complaint alleged that Mitchell Hart, the history graduate coordinator, said there was a “good chance” the university wouldn’t accept his application, and that his mentor could not in “any way” be involved with his research at UF because she was a Hamilton Center professor.

But Hart said the rejection was pretty routine and informed by university policies.

In the emailed denial, Hart told the student that he had missed the application deadline for the program, “but was of course free to apply again.” He didn’t indicate that the student’s mentor wouldn’t be able to be involved with his research but said that she couldn’t chair his thesis committee. Under [university policy](https://grad.ufl.edu/work/faculty/gfs/#:~:text=Graduate%20faculty%20status%20allows%20University,not%20have%20graduate%20faculty%20status.), a faculty member outside of a student’s home department can’t chair their thesis unless they have graduate-faculty status. The student’s mentor didn’t meet either requirement.

“It is still unclear what role, if any, someone in the Hamilton Center can play with regard to doctoral committees,” Hart told the student. “I’m afraid we are still trying to figure out the relationship, and it is certainly well above my pay grade,” he added.

“It was so banal,” Hart told *The Chronicle*; he tells prospective graduate students about policies and deadlines 10 times a day. “It’s really a very boring job,” he said. “That’s the rule. I didn’t make it, but suddenly I’m an opponent of the Hamilton Center.”

When Richardson asked Sensbach about the situation, he forwarded the exchange to the dean. “I thought it was self-explanatory, especially as dean, that he would understand Mitch was following the rules,” the chair told *The Chronicle*.

Three days later, the dean began investigating Sensbach and Hart anyway. For Hart, “that’s what really pissed me off,” he said.

“He understood that there was nothing there and that it was complete garbage to accuse me or Jon Sensbach of anything, but he went ahead and did it,” Hart said\*.\* The dean seemed to “imply that I had done something misleading, that I had tried to dissuade the student from participating in the Hamilton Center. That’s complete horseshit.”

Sidney Dobrin, the chair of the English department, was the first of the six targeted faculty members to be interviewed by human resources. The investigator’s questions left him at a loss, according to Churchill Roberts, the faculty union’s grievance-committee chair, who accompanied Dobrin to the March 12 interview. *What were his thoughts on the center? Were his faculty members “bad-mouthing” the Hamilton Center? Had his faculty members targeted students with ties to the center?* (Dobrin didn’t respond to *The Chronicle’s* requests for an interview.)

“It was a fishing expedition,” Roberts said. “They didn’t really know what they were looking for.”

Moreover, the faculty union was filing its own complaints about the matter, and graduate students weren’t speaking to the investigator.

Less than three weeks after the university launched the probe, the investigator told the targeted faculty members, without explanation, that the remaining interviews were indefinitely postponed.

Sasse publicly trumpeted the investigation in a “quick word about academic freedom” to all faculty in March. He said that he’d spoken with Richardson, who “acknowledged some egregious actions by others in the college and is working to get to the bottom of it.”

The university, Sasse wrote, depends on its ability to “expose students to a wide range of opinions in an environment free from the fear of reprisal.”

Later that month, the letter landed in the inbox of Ken McGurn, a multi-million-dollar donor and real-estate developer and lifetime member of the UF Foundation.

The word “egregious” caught his eye.

“What comes to mind when words like ‘egregious’ and ‘investigation’ are used is that someone is a pedophile or beat up a widow or killed someone,” McGurn told Richardson in an email. “I would sincerely appreciate knowing what actions prompted the use of such inflammatory language.”

“As a long-term supporter of UF,” the donor added, “I am very concerned.”

Publicly available information about the investigation was scarce at the time — so McGurn, also a former U.S. military spy, began an investigation of his own. He had a brief phone conversation with Richardson, who seemed “under a lot of pressure,” he said. (Richardson also told him that “egregious” wasn’t his word.) He spoke to faculty members who were nervous and exhausted.

McGurn brought the issue to the president in a letter. “Help!” he wrote in the first sentence.

The letter was one of a half-dozen McGurn sent over the next three months that urged Sasse to put an end to the investigation and apologize to the “Gainesville 6.” In another letter, McGurn asked Sasse to clarify a list of “rumors,” including that “if you criticize, you are ostracized,” and that his administration was a “black hole.”

“The Emperor Has No Clothes,” he told the president. “Who can U trust to tell the truth?”

Sasse ignored all of the donor’s messages, and the university went into “silent mode” on the investigation, McGurn told *The Chronicle*. At an April foundation meeting, McGurn stood at the exit, extended his hand, and “softly” told Sasse that “it needs to go away.” Sasse shook his hand but “did not respond otherwise.”

On May 6, McGurn made a final plea to both Sasse and Richardson. “These are good people,” he wrote. “They do not deserve this. UF does not need this. Please make it go away.”

Richardson quit the next day. His five-sentence resignation letter gave no rationale for the decision. Less than three weeks later, the university notified the six targeted liberal-arts faculty, also without explanation, that the investigation was “not moving forward.”

Roberts, the faculty union’s grievance-council chair, said McGurn’s intervention was a decisive factor in both decisions. “The university thumbs its nose at the union,” he said. “Once major donors get involved, they sit up and listen.”

The university later said that no personnel action was taken against the faculty, and documents from the investigation will not be considered in their future performance evaluations, including post-tenure reviews.

Some think they are still owed an apology, but “the university would rather do anything than apologize,” Roberts said. The six faculty have “incredible loyalty toward the university, and they just dumped on them.”

The investigation’s closure cooled the feud between the units, but tensions still simmer.

The Faculty Senate’s former chair, Danaya Wright, said she tried her “damn best” to take the Hamilton Center’s concerns seriously. She created [a task force](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25262636-copy-of-curricular-review-working-group-report-final?responsive=1&title=1) to examine possible “political and structural headwinds” and invited center officials to participate, noting that “the issues plaguing the Hamilton Center are structural issues that go back for more than a decade.”

Inboden rejected the offer. The invitation’s “tendentious and distorted language” implied the center was “somehow at fault for the hostility and opposition we have faced,” he told Wright in an email. “I conclude with genuine sadness that the Faculty Senate would appear to be indulging in such parochialism.”

Wright said she also scrambled to advance the Hamilton Center’s degree proposals, fearing possible blowback if she didn’t. Faculty members typically take a month to review such proposals, and the end of the academic year was fast approaching, she told *The Chronicle*. But she said the Faculty Senate didn’t receive the documents until a week before its May meeting, the last one of the academic year. Faculty members ran out of time and voted to table the degree proposals without discussion, effectively punting the decision until the fall.

In the robing room of a graduation ceremony held days later, Sasse told Wright that the Faculty Senate had “lost his respect” and “should not exist,” Wright said, and refused to speak with her for the remainder of the event. (Sasse didn’t respond to an emailed question about the interaction.)

“He was childish,” Wright told *The Chronicle*.

The Faculty Senate was forced to vote on the center’s degree proposals in a first-of-its-kind special summer meeting, called by Wright’s newly seated successor to discuss campus safety. Around that time, the faculty union issued a letter alleging that the last-minute gathering had been called “presumably to enable” the Hamilton Center to meet approval deadlines. In response, one of the center’s associate directors told the union president that “with absolute certainty,” he and his colleagues wanted to sever ties with the union because of its “active campaign against the Hamilton Center.”

Less than half of the Faculty Senate’s body participated in the Zoom meeting, due in part to issues with the electronic voting system. Senators ultimately approved the proposals, putting the majors back on track for their planned launch. The state university system’s Board of Governors gave final approval to both of the majors in October.

Inboden told *The Chronicle* that the center “scrupulously adhered to every requirement and step in UF’s rigorous process” in an emailed statement. “Last year’s growth included some growing pains,” Inboden said. “Those are in the past.”

Mary Watt, the interim liberal-arts dean, said the college is “proud to be partners” with the Hamilton Center.

“We enjoy an excellent working relationship,” she said in an emailed statement.

The center plans to offer three more majors beginning in 2026. A state-backed $40-million renovation of UF’s historical infirmary building into the Hamilton College is underway. This fall, the center offers 19 general-education courses and has amassed a flotilla of more than 30 humanities faculty members and Ivy League scholars — including Sasse.

The president abruptly stepped down in July, citing a need to spend more time with his family after his wife’s recent epilepsy diagnosis. He’s teaching a new course, “Civil Discourse and the American Political Order,” at the center next spring. Before resigning from his post, he negotiated an addendum to his employment contract to [keep his $1 million salary through 2028](https://www.tampabay.com/news/education/2024/08/26/sasse-keep-1-million-salary-uf-until-2028/) — making Sasse among the highest-paid professors in UF’s history.

He is now embroiled in a scandal after [The Independent Florida Alligator](https://www.alligator.org/article/2024/08/sasse-s-spending-spree-former-uf-president-channeled-millions-to-gop-allies-secretive-contracts)*,* UF’s student newspaper, reported that he tripled his office’s spending to award contracts to boutique consulting firms and high-paid, remote positions to his former Senate staff. Amid bipartisan calls for an audit, Sasse issued a [1,744-word defense](https://x.com/BenSasse/status/1824475441933193386) on X. He touted the Hamilton Center as the “firstfruit” of his presidency and as evidence that big spending was necessary for his administration’s “‘go bigger’ approach.”

The center is “well on its way to making UF the top Western Civilization program in the nation — and we will ground our students in the foundations of the Great Books and the American political order,” he said. “Parents: you should send your kids here.”

Tucked in the middle of Sasse’s monograph was a reprised rebuke of pedagogical orthodoxy among “humanities professors with nichified interests” who “are allowed to drive demand unscrutinized into their narrow silos.”

Sasse’s parting message stirred Sensbach, now on temporary leave after finishing his three-year term as history chair. The former president, he said, was “an unabashed champion of the Hamilton Center at the expense of everybody else.”

Sasse “never missed an opportunity to denigrate other departments and dismiss the seriousness of their scholarship,” Sensbach said. “He hadn’t been on the campus five minutes before he started accusing us of indoctrinating students and being ‘nichified’ and instructing us how to teach. …We didn’t need that lecturing.”

With Sasse out of leadership, Sensbach hopes to return next spring to a liberal-arts college that can “coexist with the Hamilton Center amicably.”

“I think we can reach an understanding that that’s the case without his loud trumpeting of his belief that nobody else was worth a hill of beans at the University of Florida,” Sensbach said. “We can talk together and have a good collaboration — that to me is what it should be about, rather than pitting one side against the other as Sasse seemed to be doing.”",1,1730757924.0,GNV,0,1.0,False

Ben Sasse was angry.

It was the spring of 2024, and the University of Florida’s new Hamilton Center for Classical and Civic Education was getting off the ground. Sasse, then the university’s president, was a self-described “zealot” of the center, a Republican-backed venture to teach students about the Western canon and civil discourse.

But the rollout was hitting roadblocks. Several graduate students had complained that liberal-arts faculty were targeting them for affiliating with the Hamilton Center. There were murmurs that humanities departments would block its curricular proposals. The center’s director later described some professors’ conduct as “abuses.”

So Sasse spoke to David Richardson, then dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. According to two academic leaders who received nearly identical accounts of the conversation, Sasse gave the dean an ultimatum: Deal with it, or he would absorb the liberal-arts college into the Hamilton Center. In one of those accounts, Sasse said Richardson’s job was on the line.

A third academic leader said that all they could disclose about the exchange was that it was “unpleasant.”

Sasse’s ultimatum was at odds with the Hamilton Center’s original pitch as an independent academic unit — one that would collaborate with UF’s liberal-arts college. The center would “build on existing strengths,” its inaugural director said.

But for most of the last academic year, the Hamilton Center was locked in a behind-the-scenes turf war with the college. The center said faculty members waged an active campaign against it, stifling its progress and discriminating against its students. Some liberal-arts faculty countered that the center was duplicating their established departments’ offerings and shirking typical university protocols.

The clash culminated in a [university investigation](https://www.chronicle.com/article/u-of-florida-investigates-whether-professors-interfered-with-western-civ-center) into whether six liberal-arts faculty members had “interfered” with the Hamilton Center — a probe that threatened disciplinary action up to termination. *The Chronicle’s* reporting is based on over a dozen interviews with university officials and rank-and-file faculty, and scores of emails and documents obtained through public-records requests and those involved.

Florida is among half a dozen states where civics schools and centers with Republican ties have sprung up, envisioned as an antidote to concerns that left-leaning humanities professors are turning away from Western thought and that conservative scholars are underrepresented. National faculty advocates have sounded alarms about the new units, which they see as a troubling injection of political influence into teaching.

Sasse’s conversation with Richardson, in which the then-president threatened to trample on UF’s existing liberal-arts programs, encapsulates professors’ fears about the worst-case scenario. So does what happened next.

As some liberal-arts faculty see it, the Hamilton Center’s opaque origins tarnished it from the start.

The center wasn’t UF’s idea. A little-known group called the Council on Public University Reform hired the former chief of staff of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis to lobby for the center’s creation, [*The Chronicle* reported last year](https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-a-center-for-civic-education-became-a-political-provocation?sra=true).

The [initial proposal](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25262638-hamilton-center_s-initial-proposal?responsive=1&title=1) for the center argued that the fundamental mission of higher education — to seek truth — was threatened by “cancel culture and uniformity of opinion on campus.” It called for a “robust and fiercely independent center” at UF that fostered “political and intellectual diversity” and a “traditional liberal education in the Great Books that form the foundation of Western intellectual tradition.”

The Hamilton Center — named for the founding father — would exist outside any departments or colleges and offer its own courses and interdisciplinary degree programs, per the initial proposal. A board of advisers would provide a list of initial faculty hires to the university’s Board of Trustees, which would make final selections. If the center’s faculty were to be hired through existing departments, the proposal said, “the result would be a replication of what already exists.”

After the former DeSantis aide delivered the proposal to the university in January 2022, a lengthy deliberation ensued. Joseph Glover, the then-provost, argued the proposal laid out “a conservative agenda to influence the curriculum” and did “not align well” with administrative and faculty governance structures. Edits were made, the proposal was OK’d, and by July, the center had been established, had a director, and was equipped with a $3 million start-up injection from the Legislature.

The Hamilton Center entered UF in a period of transition. Kent Fuchs, then the president, and Glover were on their way out. Sasse, who succeeded Fuchs in February 2023, became the center’s biggest champion, jockeying to fast-track its development. Less than four months after taking office, he replaced the center’s inaugural director with William Inboden — a close friend of 30 years and a historian of the American presidency and the Cold War at the University of Texas at Austin. Sasse, a former Republican U.S. senator from Nebraska, also leveraged his political acumen with the Florida Legislature to bolster the center’s recurring state funding to $10 million. He even co-taught a course at the center, “The American Idea,” last spring.

While building up the center, he also rejected the notion that it was a partisan project. “It’s just classically liberal,” Sasse said in June of this year. “It’s not right of center. We’re not interested in your politics.…We’re wrestling with big questions here, and political indoctrination is boring.” He also described the center’s broad disciplinary lens as a remedy for the “nichification” of humanities scholarship.

Not all faculty were convinced. [Some still feared](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25262634-faculty-fears-report?responsive=1&title=1) the Hamilton Center was a Trojan Horse for the state’s conservative agenda and would siphon resources from existing units. A few months after the center was established, an [anonymous swath](https://fora.aa.ufl.edu/docs/78/2023-2024/Report%20of%20the%20Ad%20Hoc%20Task%20Force%20on%20Shared%20Governance%20draft%20with%20survey%20results-Final.pdf) of liberal-arts and law professors told the Faculty Senate that they feared the center was a “shadow college” meant to replace humanities departments without faculty input, and now regarded university officials who helped in its creation as “agents of the state.”

Last fall, the center offered 10 courses and housed more than a dozen faculty and staff members. But Republican power brokers have higher aspirations for the center. Beginning in 2025, the center is required by law to report its progress toward becoming a fully fledged school — Hamilton College — within the university. To get majors off the ground by 2025, approvals needed to begin in the spring of 2024 and would require the support of departments where there may be curricular overlap.

In other words: The Hamilton Center had to convince some of its biggest skeptics in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to sign off.

When Inboden, the Hamilton Center’s new director, presented to liberal-arts faculty about the center’s two inaugural majors — Great Books and Ideas, and Philosophy, Politics, Economics, and Law — he was met with silence and “blank stares,” according to a faculty member in attendance.

Later, an associate dean relayed to a Hamilton Center associate director that humanities departments would be “upset” if the majors were approved.

Then, when two Hamilton Center courses came up for review by the university’s General Education Committee, its co-chair — a classics professor — subverted the standard process. The co-chair asked at least two humanities department heads to evaluate whether the center’s courses overlapped with their departments’ existing offerings. But the General Education Committee wasn’t supposed to have authority over such consultations.

The fact that humanities chairs got involved at that stage angered Inboden, who later called the decision a “deliberate violation” of usual curricular protocols, “despite being strongly urged against doing so by multiple senior officials in the provost’s office.”

Meanwhile, Hamilton Center officials had been talking to humanities graduate students over several months about their interest in the center’s Graduate Fellows program. Those conversations revealed concerns about facing backlash from their home departments, including English, history, and anthropology.

One graduate student believed that if her home department were to find out about her Hamilton Center ties, “she would lose important friends, mentors, and allies necessary for her to pursue academic excellence,” according to an email from Inboden to Sasse describing the students’ complaints.

Another student said that his department had “many faculty members who hate the Hamilton Center and would not be happy at all should a student affiliate themselves” with it. The student also thanked the center’s academic specialist for meeting with him at an off-campus coffee shop, “away from people who might see us.”

A third student said his department “has essentially dissociated from him.”

A separate complaint suggested that, in one case, a faculty member had acted on their biases. A prospective doctoral student told his mentor, who had recently been hired by the Hamilton Center, that the history department’s graduate coordinator had rejected his transfer request to UF. Moreover, the student claimed he was told that his mentor would “not be able to be involved” in his research in “any way” because she was a Hamilton Center faculty member.

Inboden was “pretty shocked to hear about the abuses that came to light in the past week,” he told Richardson, the liberal-arts dean, in an email at the time. “I was very familiar with the vocal opposition to the Hamilton Center expressed by many \[College of Liberal Arts and Sciences\] faculty but had not realized that in some cases it extended to targeting graduate students and applicants,” Inboden said. “Hopefully further investigation will provide the full picture.”

As the Hamilton Center’s grievances grew, Sasse gave Richardson the ultimatum, threatening to dissolve the liberal-arts college unless his faculty stopped meddling with the center. Once Sasse got involved, one faculty member said, the dynamic between the liberal-arts college and the Hamilton Center “became a whole different animal.”

One academic leader who received an account of the conversation wrote at the time that Sasse planned to follow through on his threat if anyone in the college either criticized the Hamilton Center or insisted that its curricular proposals go through regular university procedures, according to email records. That faculty member didn’t respond to an interview request.

Jon Sensbach, chair of the history department, told *The Chronicle* that he spoke with two people with direct knowledge of Sasse’s exchange with Richardson and that Sasse had been “livid.” He declined to publicly identify the sources because they feared professional repercussions.

Whether or not Sasse planned to follow through on the threat, “it seems to have served as a way to intimidate the dean into taking drastic steps,” Sensbach said.

Neither Richardson nor Sasse responded to *The Chronicle’s* interview requests or an emailed list of questions, including ones about details of their conversation. A university spokesperson also didn’t answer questions about what Sasse said.

The exchange quickly became the center of gossip among faculty. At a Faculty Senate meeting in March, a philosophy professor asked whether humanities departments would be “siphoned off” into the Hamilton Center. “I’m hoping that this is a silly rumor that has no basis in fact,” the professor said, “but God knows what might be going on.”

J. Scott Angle, the provost, responded that while there was a “quite a dynamic environment of events” between the center and the liberal-arts college that have “kicked off these wildfires,” plans for a merger were “not going anywhere.” But with Sasse, Angle continued, “literally everything is on the table.”

Meanwhile Richardson, who was no stranger to [controversies over academic freedom](https://www.chronicle.com/article/u-of-florida-dean-says-he-was-directed-to-reject-professors-request-to-testify-against-the-state?sra=true), was trying to do damage control.

“The rumor you are hearing is completely false,” the dean wrote in response to another concerned professor. Then Richardson told his four associate deans that if any of them “implied or touched on this idea with anyone outside of the college office it needs to be corrected.”

“I hope none of you were the source of statements that might have led to those rumors,” he wrote in an email.

Either way, Sasse had put Richardson under the gun.

The dean “fully understood the president’s reaction” to the graduate students’ complaints and shared his “anger and determination to stop the causative behavior,” he told Inboden in an email. “We are beginning those corrections.”

Within days of talking to Sasse, Richardson put in place plans to ensure faculty members’ cooperation with the center.

He scheduled emergency meetings for March 2 — a Saturday — with the associate deans and seven humanities chairs to discuss “the general range of their faculty’s thoughts” on the Hamilton Center’s curriculum and if they were aware of “any unprofessional mentoring of graduate students” regarding the center.

Coming out of the meetings, some felt targeted. John A. Palmer, chair of the philosophy department. wrote in an email afterward that he was “frankly, offended at being cast as obstructionist.”

“Not that I imagine anyone will care,” he told an associate dean, to whom Richardson had just assigned all future curricular matters involving the Hamilton Center. Center leaders, Palmer continued, “should be more careful about bad-mouthing UF faculty who have been making genuine efforts since before their arrival at UF to be cooperative with the Hamilton Center.”

Despite the behind-the-scenes friction, Richardson told Sasse in a written debrief of the meetings that “all chairs were forthcoming and reported that they would cooperate” with the Hamilton Center on curricular matters and “correcting issues with graduate mentoring.” He reiterated: “I fully share the president’s displeasure.”

The dean would get those promises in writing.

Around 9 p.m. after the Saturday meetings, the seven humanities chairs were directed to sign pledges to cooperate with the center, including giving approvals for its two planned majors. They had less than a week to comply. “I know it’s a tight turnaround,” the associate dean — Richardson’s newly tapped Hamilton Center liaison — told the chairs. “I again appreciate your cooperation.” They could modify the pledge template, the associate dean said, “but the message of supporting/not objecting should be clear.”

The [pledge template](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25262641-pledge-to-cooperate?responsive=1&title=1) included this suggested language: “We believe that the Hamilton Center curriculum will provide a unique opportunity for students interested in these areas and will complement our department’s offerings nicely. We have no objection to the implementation of these courses and degrees.” The template also encouraged chairs to “fully support” having the center’s faculty serve on graduate committees for master’s and doctoral students.

That Saturday night marked the first time that Sensbach, the history chair, had seen the Hamilton Center’s official degree proposals, he told *The Chronicle*, so he felt “ill-prepared to comment” on the curriculum. During a meeting the following week with department colleagues, he acknowledged the “stark choice” between doing a thorough review and facing possible consequences if they didn’t sign the pledge.

“They agreed we needed to do that,” Sensbach said.

All seven chairs [submitted their pledges](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25262635-caveats?responsive=1&title=1) by the five-day deadline — with some caveats. Only one chair used the draft template. Two omitted language that would have endorsed having Hamilton faculty members serve on their departments’ graduate committees. Five stipulated that they would cooperate with the center as long as its efforts went through “official channels” and “well-established procedures.”

In the midst of that frenzy, three of the department chairs got another message: Richardson had placed them under investigation.

The English, history, and anthropology chairs, as well as the departments’ graduate coordinators, faced allegations that they had “interfered” with the Hamilton Center. The notices cited university policies regarding [academic freedom](https://hr.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-2024-UFF-UF-Collective-Bargaining-Agreement.pdf) and “[disruptive behavior](https://policy.ufl.edu/regulation/1-008/),” violators of which face [disciplinary action](https://policy.ufl.edu/regulation/7-048/) up to termination.

Sensbach said that being asked to sign an “oath of fealty” to the Hamilton Center while the threat of termination “hung over my head” amounted to “arm-twisting.”

“I was being asked to conform to some policy or some ideological position that was being imposed from several layers above,” he said. “There was no question in my mind about what I was being forced to do.”

Sensbach said the 11-week investigation was “the most stressful time” in his 26-year tenure at UF. He constantly feared the university was monitoring his emails. He had trouble sleeping.

The history chair wasn’t a foe of the Hamilton Center. The scholar of colonial America and the American Revolution didn’t think it was a problem that the center’s curricular offerings overlapped with his department.

But he understood the more critical views. The university’s humanities departments have had to “scratch and scramble” to hire faculty in recent years, he said, whereas the center had a “lavish” $10-million recruitment stipend from the state. The history department’s entire budget is $4 million.

A “jealousy” toward the center brewed, he said.

“There was a sense that the Hamilton Center and its priorities were being floated ahead of long-standing departments who have been teaching all kinds of subjects, including Western civilization, for decades,” he said. “It’s clear that the Hamilton Center was moving ahead without anybody else’s input. That generated a lot of resentment.”

Now Sensbach felt that resentment was being pinned on him.

The investigation concerned whether Sensbach and five other faculty members had “engaged in actions or inactions which impaired, interfered with, or obstructed the ability of students to participate in academic programs” or “faculty members’ ability to teach and/or advise students” within said programs, according to the notices they received.

It’s not clear why the history department was targeted, though Sensbach believes one driver may have been the complaint last spring from the prospective graduate student whose transfer application was rejected.

The student’s complaint alleged that Mitchell Hart, the history graduate coordinator, said there was a “good chance” the university wouldn’t accept his application, and that his mentor could not in “any way” be involved with his research at UF because she was a Hamilton Center professor.

But Hart said the rejection was pretty routine and informed by university policies.

In the emailed denial, Hart told the student that he had missed the application deadline for the program, “but was of course free to apply again.” He didn’t indicate that the student’s mentor wouldn’t be able to be involved with his research but said that she couldn’t chair his thesis committee. Under [university policy](https://grad.ufl.edu/work/faculty/gfs/#:~:text=Graduate%20faculty%20status%20allows%20University,not%20have%20graduate%20faculty%20status.), a faculty member outside of a student’s home department can’t chair their thesis unless they have graduate-faculty status. The student’s mentor didn’t meet either requirement.

“It is still unclear what role, if any, someone in the Hamilton Center can play with regard to doctoral committees,” Hart told the student. “I’m afraid we are still trying to figure out the relationship, and it is certainly well above my pay grade,” he added.

“It was so banal,” Hart told *The Chronicle*; he tells prospective graduate students about policies and deadlines 10 times a day. “It’s really a very boring job,” he said. “That’s the rule. I didn’t make it, but suddenly I’m an opponent of the Hamilton Center.”

When Richardson asked Sensbach about the situation, he forwarded the exchange to the dean. “I thought it was self-explanatory, especially as dean, that he would understand Mitch was following the rules,” the chair told *The Chronicle*.

Three days later, the dean began investigating Sensbach and Hart anyway. For Hart, “that’s what really pissed me off,” he said.

“He understood that there was nothing there and that it was complete garbage to accuse me or Jon Sensbach of anything, but he went ahead and did it,” Hart said\*.\* The dean seemed to “imply that I had done something misleading, that I had tried to dissuade the student from participating in the Hamilton Center. That’s complete horseshit.”

Sidney Dobrin, the chair of the English department, was the first of the six targeted faculty members to be interviewed by human resources. The investigator’s questions left him at a loss, according to Churchill Roberts, the faculty union’s grievance-committee chair, who accompanied Dobrin to the March 12 interview. *What were his thoughts on the center? Were his faculty members “bad-mouthing” the Hamilton Center? Had his faculty members targeted students with ties to the center?* (Dobrin didn’t respond to *The Chronicle’s* requests for an interview.)

“It was a fishing expedition,” Roberts said. “They didn’t really know what they were looking for.”

Moreover, the faculty union was filing its own complaints about the matter, and graduate students weren’t speaking to the investigator.

Less than three weeks after the university launched the probe, the investigator told the targeted faculty members, without explanation, that the remaining interviews were indefinitely postponed.

Sasse publicly trumpeted the investigation in a “quick word about academic freedom” to all faculty in March. He said that he’d spoken with Richardson, who “acknowledged some egregious actions by others in the college and is working to get to the bottom of it.”

The university, Sasse wrote, depends on its ability to “expose students to a wide range of opinions in an environment free from the fear of reprisal.”

Later that month, the letter landed in the inbox of Ken McGurn, a multi-million-dollar donor and real-estate developer and lifetime member of the UF Foundation.

The word “egregious” caught his eye.

“What comes to mind when words like ‘egregious’ and ‘investigation’ are used is that someone is a pedophile or beat up a widow or killed someone,” McGurn told Richardson in an email. “I would sincerely appreciate knowing what actions prompted the use of such inflammatory language.”

“As a long-term supporter of UF,” the donor added, “I am very concerned.”

Publicly available information about the investigation was scarce at the time — so McGurn, also a former U.S. military spy, began an investigation of his own. He had a brief phone conversation with Richardson, who seemed “under a lot of pressure,” he said. (Richardson also told him that “egregious” wasn’t his word.) He spoke to faculty members who were nervous and exhausted.

McGurn brought the issue to the president in a letter. “Help!” he wrote in the first sentence.

The letter was one of a half-dozen McGurn sent over the next three months that urged Sasse to put an end to the investigation and apologize to the “Gainesville 6.” In another letter, McGurn asked Sasse to clarify a list of “rumors,” including that “if you criticize, you are ostracized,” and that his administration was a “black hole.”

“The Emperor Has No Clothes,” he told the president. “Who can U trust to tell the truth?”

Sasse ignored all of the donor’s messages, and the university went into “silent mode” on the investigation, McGurn told *The Chronicle*. At an April foundation meeting, McGurn stood at the exit, extended his hand, and “softly” told Sasse that “it needs to go away.” Sasse shook his hand but “did not respond otherwise.”

On May 6, McGurn made a final plea to both Sasse and Richardson. “These are good people,” he wrote. “They do not deserve this. UF does not need this. Please make it go away.”

Richardson quit the next day. His five-sentence resignation letter gave no rationale for the decision. Less than three weeks later, the university notified the six targeted liberal-arts faculty, also without explanation, that the investigation was “not moving forward.”

Roberts, the faculty union’s grievance-council chair, said McGurn’s intervention was a decisive factor in both decisions. “The university thumbs its nose at the union,” he said. “Once major donors get involved, they sit up and listen.”

The university later said that no personnel action was taken against the faculty, and documents from the investigation will not be considered in their future performance evaluations, including post-tenure reviews.

Some think they are still owed an apology, but “the university would rather do anything than apologize,” Roberts said. The six faculty have “incredible loyalty toward the university, and they just dumped on them.”

The investigation’s closure cooled the feud between the units, but tensions still simmer.

The Faculty Senate’s former chair, Danaya Wright, said she tried her “damn best” to take the Hamilton Center’s concerns seriously. She created [a task force](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25262636-copy-of-curricular-review-working-group-report-final?responsive=1&title=1) to examine possible “political and structural headwinds” and invited center officials to participate, noting that “the issues plaguing the Hamilton Center are structural issues that go back for more than a decade.”

Inboden rejected the offer. The invitation’s “tendentious and distorted language” implied the center was “somehow at fault for the hostility and opposition we have faced,” he told Wright in an email. “I conclude with genuine sadness that the Faculty Senate would appear to be indulging in such parochialism.”

Wright said she also scrambled to advance the Hamilton Center’s degree proposals, fearing possible blowback if she didn’t. Faculty members typically take a month to review such proposals, and the end of the academic year was fast approaching, she told *The Chronicle*. But she said the Faculty Senate didn’t receive the documents until a week before its May meeting, the last one of the academic year. Faculty members ran out of time and voted to table the degree proposals without discussion, effectively punting the decision until the fall.

In the robing room of a graduation ceremony held days later, Sasse told Wright that the Faculty Senate had “lost his respect” and “should not exist,” Wright said, and refused to speak with her for the remainder of the event. (Sasse didn’t respond to an emailed question about the interaction.)

“He was childish,” Wright told *The Chronicle*.

The Faculty Senate was forced to vote on the center’s degree proposals in a first-of-its-kind special summer meeting, called by Wright’s newly seated successor to discuss campus safety. Around that time, the faculty union issued a letter alleging that the last-minute gathering had been called “presumably to enable” the Hamilton Center to meet approval deadlines. In response, one of the center’s associate directors told the union president that “with absolute certainty,” he and his colleagues wanted to sever ties with the union because of its “active campaign against the Hamilton Center.”

Less than half of the Faculty Senate’s body participated in the Zoom meeting, due in part to issues with the electronic voting system. Senators ultimately approved the proposals, putting the majors back on track for their planned launch. The state university system’s Board of Governors gave final approval to both of the majors in October.

Inboden told *The Chronicle* that the center “scrupulously adhered to every requirement and step in UF’s rigorous process” in an emailed statement. “Last year’s growth included some growing pains,” Inboden said. “Those are in the past.”

Mary Watt, the interim liberal-arts dean, said the college is “proud to be partners” with the Hamilton Center.

“We enjoy an excellent working relationship,” she said in an emailed statement.

The center plans to offer three more majors beginning in 2026. A state-backed $40-million renovation of UF’s historical infirmary building into the Hamilton College is underway. This fall, the center offers 19 general-education courses and has amassed a flotilla of more than 30 humanities faculty members and Ivy League scholars — including Sasse.

The president abruptly stepped down in July, citing a need to spend more time with his family after his wife’s recent epilepsy diagnosis. He’s teaching a new course, “Civil Discourse and the American Political Order,” at the center next spring. Before resigning from his post, he negotiated an addendum to his employment contract to [keep his $1 million salary through 2028](https://www.tampabay.com/news/education/2024/08/26/sasse-keep-1-million-salary-uf-until-2028/) — making Sasse among the highest-paid professors in UF’s history.

He is now embroiled in a scandal after [*The Independent Florida Alligator*](https://www.alligator.org/article/2024/08/sasse-s-spending-spree-former-uf-president-channeled-millions-to-gop-allies-secretive-contracts)*,* UF’s student newspaper, reported that he tripled his office’s spending to award contracts to boutique consulting firms and high-paid, remote positions to his former Senate staff. Amid bipartisan calls for an audit, Sasse issued a [1,744-word defense](https://x.com/BenSasse/status/1824475441933193386) on X. He touted the Hamilton Center as the “firstfruit” of his presidency and as evidence that big spending was necessary for his administration’s “‘go bigger’ approach.”

The center is “well on its way to making UF the top Western Civilization program in the nation — and we will ground our students in the foundations of the Great Books and the American political order,” he said. “Parents: you should send your kids here.”

Tucked in the middle of Sasse’s monograph was a reprised rebuke of pedagogical orthodoxy among “humanities professors with nichified interests” who “are allowed to drive demand unscrutinized into their narrow silos.”

Sasse’s parting message stirred Sensbach, now on temporary leave after finishing his three-year term as history chair. The former president, he said, was “an unabashed champion of the Hamilton Center at the expense of everybody else.”

Sasse “never missed an opportunity to denigrate other departments and dismiss the seriousness of their scholarship,” Sensbach said. “He hadn’t been on the campus five minutes before he started accusing us of indoctrinating students and being ‘nichified’ and instructing us how to teach. …We didn’t need that lecturing.”

With Sasse out of leadership, Sensbach hopes to return next spring to a liberal-arts college that can “coexist with the Hamilton Center amicably.”

“I think we can reach an understanding that that’s the case without his loud trumpeting of his belief that nobody else was worth a hill of beans at the University of Florida,” Sensbach said. “We can talk together and have a good collaboration — that to me is what it should be about, rather than pitting one side against the other as Sasse seemed to be doing.”",1,1730757865.0,ufl,0,1.0,False

I just had my first date since my break up with my ex (happened in May). 

I went in and had no expectations but we got on much more then I thought we would. The date had lots of laughs, good banter, he was attractive, I felt like there was something there. It was a 2 hour date getting coffee and then a walk. 

He mentioned doing something again, nearer to me this time. (more than once), but we didn’t make concrete plans. 

As we were leaving, he gave me a hug, wished me a safe journey home. I asked when he was next in my city (he comes close to where I live for work once a week). He said usually on Monday, but again no plans were made. 

I was worried I gave him signs of disinterest, so I text him when I was home, confirmed I had a good time and said it would be good to see him again. He said likewise and he should be near me next time. 

I replied this morning saying let me know when he’s next around and we can plan something but no reply as of yet. 

He did mention he has a very stressful job, and they have recently moved house, so I know they have a lot going on. 

I don’t know if it’s because it’s my first date post break up, or I wasn’t expected to get on with him, but I feel overally invested in the outcome which is concerning me, as it’s been one date.

Coffee snob and caffeine addict here. 

I'm a regular coffee drinker who enjoys his everyday morning and afternoon espresso. I'm not very particular about the taste as long as it tastes moderately good and is not Starbucks. The reason I'm making this post is because I want to live a bit more regularly. 

For the past week, I've been waking up early and it's doing me a lot of good. I like being able to sleep and wake up early. But this afternoon my caffeine crash is finally kicking in, and I also like to just go through the process of making coffee, as it is very calming. However, I do not have decaf beans or ways to have coffee wihtout affecting my sleep schedule.

I'm thinking of decaf, which I will have access to. However, I'm just wondering if it has worked for people for an afternoon I-want-a-taste-of-coffee-but-don't-want-the-consequences-of-coffee thing. Or has it worked too well that it keeps you awake at night? 

Would love to hear anyone's experience.

1gjq7v7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BGodInspired/comments/1gjq7v7/roots_of_kindness_nurturing_supportive/,Roots of Kindness: Nurturing Supportive Friendships in Faith,"https://bgodinspired.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1730756124.png

### Devotional: Roots of Kindness – Nurturing Supportive Friendships in Faith

**Scripture Reading:**  
*“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things, there is no law.”* – Galatians 5:22-23 (NIV)

#### Reflection:

In our journey of faith, the roots of kindness are essential for nurturing supportive friendships. Just as a plant needs deep roots to grow strong and vibrant, our relationships require kindness to flourish. Paul reminds us in Galatians that kindness is a fruit of the Spirit, a gift that manifests in our hearts and spills over into our interactions with others.

To cultivate kindness in our friendships, we must start with a heart aligned with God. When we immerse ourselves in prayer and Scripture, we allow the Holy Spirit to soften us, empowering us to express love, joy, and kindness to those around us. Kindness is not merely an action; it’s a reflection of God’s love flowing through us.

#### Contemplation:

Consider your current friendships. Are they rooted in mutual support, kindness, and faith? Reflect on how you can nurture these relationships further. Are there ways to offer genuine encouragement? Are there burdens you can lift together through prayer or shared experiences?

**Prayer:**  
Dear Lord, thank You for the gift of friendship. Help me to nurture the roots of kindness in my relationships, so they may grow deeper in faith and support. Teach me to be an instrument of Your love, to encourage those around me, and to be a source of compassion in times of need. Let my companionships reflect Your goodness, so together we may shine Your light in this world. In Jesus’ name, Amen.

#### Action Steps:

1. **Reach Out:** Make it a point this week to connect with a friend, whether it’s a simple text, a call, or a coffee date. Share about your faith journey and offer your support.
2. **Acts of Kindness:** Intentionally perform a small act of kindness for someone in your circle, whether it’s offering a listening ear or surprising them with a thoughtful gesture.
3. **Prayer Partner:** Consider establishing a prayer partnership with a friend. Commit to praying for one another regularly, inviting God into the center of your friendship.

#### Conclusion:

As we cultivate supportive friendships rooted in kindness, we become beacons of hope in a world yearning for connection. Each act of kindness nurtured amidst our friendships strengthens our bonds and draws us closer to God. Remember, the roots we plant today will bear the fruit of love and faith for tomorrow. Let kindness be your guiding principle, and watch how it transforms both you and your friendships in beautiful ways.

Crime crew :All for nothin'

Sector one: a quiet town dubbed wedstock.

Its a lovely evening. As wind brisks across the newly risen sun and birds are flappping their winds in the trees. Here we zoom in on our main character. A young Citizen from the quiet village of wedstock. Their name is Judy. Now They don't really have a home, infact, They live a very open lifestyle. Although it can be troublesome when winter comes. Judy always finds a way around. Be it sneaking into a bar after hours, or possibly hiding in an equipment box at a local botanists. Either way. They'll always feel safe in their own company. Cold temperatures don't affect them much. But as for Judy. They're quite keen on snatching a coffee when they get the chance
As you can probably tell. Judy's life is a bit complicated... And that's just the stone of the seed. They've got morals but don't stand by them often. Judy also lacks a job. So they do what others normally wouldn't do to get around. It's not like judy hasn't tried to get a job. It's just their social skills are far from perfect, and thats not mentioning their records, which they'renot keen on sharing. So as for Judy, They are stuck in a loop. But thats all about to change soon...

Judy is walking across the newly installed pavement. They're previous encounter with the cashier at Load-off coffee didn't go well. So they threw that to the back of their mind. Children are dancing to the radio one of them brought to show-off. Judy (feeling under the weather.) Smirks, turns off the radio, looks back and continues crossing the path. Eventually karma catches up as they get hit in the head with a football an older kid had kicked. Judy falls to the ground and groans. He knows the kid did it by pure accident. But can't help but feel irritated. 

(Kid:) ""Sorry!""

 The kid helps him up and introduces himself, by first glance, they seem to have long musty brown hair. They're wearing a black hat with shades resting on top. And a graffiti t-shirt.  

(Kid:) 'my names Maz. Sorry about the 
ball.""

 Judy stands up and brushes off their newly dry cleaned jacket.

 (Judy:) ""I'm not concerned about that. It's your fashion sense, What even is that."" Judy says, pointing to the words on the back of Maz's shirt. The kid, now known as 

 ""oh, its a... band theyre called drop of filth! They do grunge.. and rap!"" Maz says with a smile of glee.

 Judy doesn't reply. They just mutter under there breath ""Ew,""

 The kid, now known as Maz. Gives a stopwatch to Judy. 

(Judy:) ""what's this?.. Some old stopwatch?"" 

(Maz:) ""I found it on the park bench. It's my way of apologising.""
 
'Oh wow I'm so grateful for your junk."" Judy says sarcastically. ""Look kid, i don't want this. So cry me a river. However so, I will take this scrap metal because dodgers pawn shop might make an offer.""

Now let me tell you a story about a thief. Living a life worse than Judy's. Nothing pleasures this old carpet in life except drinking and the common dealer stopping by the mugs house every afternoon. Recently, Somebody found out by their ""daily routine"" this morning and squabbled about it. But ran afterwards due to fear of being found out snooping by the dealer or deal-ee
The dealers now on the run. For a solid 12 minutes they've been hiding under a park
bench. And it's time for them to come out.

Now, Back to the main story

 Judy snatched the stopwatch, sighs, and keeps walking. When suddenly, the thief from before, starts running towards Maz, and gets them in a chokehold, they were clearly ""testing their own product"" Judy, knowing his way around a fight due to their former career in fighting, knees The mug in the crotch, loosening their grip around Maz. Letting them slip out easily.  and kicks him around the stomach area. The mug pulls Judy down and grabs them by the neck, stands up, and points a gun to their ear. The blue bandit wedstock lawside Department (BBWLD) catch up to the blanket And fire two gunshots fire as what seemed to be a warning. Which gave Judy a distorted, repressed memory from years ago

 When judy was 9. There was a burglary in wedstock, specifically crowntown jewelers. The one responsible was a drunk around their 40s. and had an untamed, messy mop of hair. They had been on something. And that was definite. They had shot a bullet at a gas tank in the corner, used to heat the place. A 9 to 5 employee was smoking in the back office during their break. It mixed with the gas and caused a chemicalic explosion. It was a terrible string of events that happened so fast for Judy to barely process. Their were about 12 people including young judy. 7 lived, Only 3 in ok condition. And unfortunately... They weren't one of them. Luckily the explosion gave nothing but  slight burns around the chest. However so the gas they had inhaled gave Judy a lung disease and they had to go through a number of surgeries. It was very shocking. Could you imagine 10s of doctors and nurses rushing towards you as you could hear nothing but the blaring sirens and the ringing in your own ears. Since then, Judy thought not to trust or befriend anyone he doesnt know, and lived a life of loneliness from that day. 

Now, To the present day

Judy tries to get out but merely struggles. At the hearing of the gun shots he breaks down into a panic and starts tossing and turning even more. They're breathing is heavy as tears begin to swell up in their eyes as Judy starts clutching their chest for breath. The Mug, evidently noticing it. Loosens up a bit. It seems they don't want to kill Judy, just get what they want. The BBWLD aims carefully.

(Mug:) ""HOLD IT! ONE MORE STEP AND THIS OLD BUMS HEAVEN-BOUND!"" 

The chief steps up. 

(Mug:) ""WHAT DID I SAY! NOW YOUR PAL HERES GOING TO PAY THE PRICE!""

 (Guard:) ""ALL UNITS! OPEN FIRE! AIM FOR THE HEAD.""

 In Judy's struggle. He pressed the stopwatch. And then. Everything died down. And became, slower?! From the bullets rushing to the trigger being pulled. Everything wasn't normal speed. But judy was. He slipped from the druggie before the trigger could be pulled. Judy, still hyperventilating. Removes his grasp from his chest and starts to put the puzzle together. Could this stopwatch be, magic?! Alienic tech?! Whatever it was. It was a close call Judy had just been through. Seeing the speed everyone was going. He had around 20 seconds before everyone noticed what speed going at.

1gjq6wi,https://www.reddit.com/r/joinmeatthecampfire/comments/1gjq6wi/the_brutalist_hotel/,The Brutalist Hotel,"I don’t believe the brutalist hotel still functions. I think it once did. I get that feeling from the yellowed plaster, and the brown stains on the ceiling tiles tell me a lot of smoking once took place here. The coffee-colored linoleum in the dormitory wing is pockmarked with ancient cigarette burns as well.

The brutalist hotel lies near the north end of the dream version of the city where I live. I first found myself there via the lurches in time and geography that always thwart my travels in my dreams. As usual, I was headed for a bar. There are several bars in the dream version of the city where I live that are dear to me. Rarely do my dreams allow me to get there, and, even when they do, I’m rarely permitted more than a glance through the door. Otherwise, I guess I wouldn’t know they exist at all.

In this instance, I was headed to a bar just north of the train station in the dream version of the city where I live. I had lucked out in finding my way out of the train station and I was frantically making my way there. My pace is always frantic in my dreams. This particular bar is not my favorite, but it has a second-stringer charm that one sometimes desires.

The train station is a terrible place. It contains an impossibly long row of menacing brass turnstiles that are automated by some inscrutable machinery. They click and turn of their own accord. Above each turnstile is a mechanical display, with rustling numerals that constantly change according to no logical pattern I can discern. The tumbling numbers sound like shuffling cards and angry hornets.

I hate the train station. The people there are blurry phantoms, and very unhelpful. They take pleasure in being unhelpful. They want you to be confused. Unlike the bars, my dreams always permit me to spend lots of time in the train station.

The people in the bars have definition. Their faces are clear and tangible, with deep lines and creases. The bars are working-class, and the patrons are mostly male. They rarely smile but they are kind. They are drunks. They sip shots with their beers and smoke endlessly. They are not phantoms. If I needed help, they would help me, if my dreams ever allowed me to talk to them. They cuss good-naturedly at each other and tell the kinds of jokes that are banal but make one feel secure.

When I say the brutalist hotel no longer functions, I do not mean it is uninhabited. I have come across at least four tangible inhabitants, as well as plenty of phantoms that whisper and gibber and generally do nobody any harm, though I am not sure that they do not intend harm. What unnerves me the most about the brutalist hotel is the fact that it looks like it once contained multitudes. There used to be company there, and now there isn’t.

The lobby of the brutalist hotel is nearly the size of a modest hockey stadium. A tiny cubicle right by the door contains the first tangible inhabitant I have met: the watchman. He is bald, somewhere between sixty and seventy years of age. He wears hornrimmed glasses with thick lenses. He is surly and smells like cabbage, because he cooks sauerkraut and potatoes in a small, cheap aluminum pot on a hotplate which sits on a tiny shelf behind him. Above the hotplate is a Stihl calendar from 1987, featuring jaundiced nude women with perms and garter belts. I like the guy, but he doesn’t seem to like anyone. Sometimes he challenges me with gibberish questions. Sometimes he just glances up at me with mild disgust. He watches old sitcoms, dubbed into Czech or German, on a portable TV. I can’t see the tiny black and white screen, but I always get the feeling it’s something like Step by Step or Perfect Strangers. The laugh track does not make him smile.

I saw him smile once, though. One awful night I found a screeching, dying chicken in a dim corner of the stadium-sized lobby, on the dirty tile floor near a tatty old sofa and a stale, aluminum standing ashtray. It lay on its side. I tried in vain to pick it up, but it continued screeching as it turned ash-gray and my fingers penetrated its body. Its body crumbled sickeningly under my touch.

I looked across the vast expanse of the lobby and cried to the watchman for help. He sighed and came out of his cubicle. I saw he was wearing shorts and rubber sandals over bare feet. As he came over in imperious strides, I stood up, the ashy matter of the chicken coating my fingers, and pointed to the mess on the floor. I tried to make myself understood, but I didn’t speak his language. He looked at the chicken and laughed in an almost lascivious way. He grinned and elbowed me in the ribs, making remarks in some dialect that seemed halfway between Slovak and Polish. It was obvious by the nudging and the leering that the remarks were unseemly.

The stairwells are the worst part of the brutalist hotel. Sometimes the stairs take you to the next floor up. Sometimes they take you back to the lobby, in which case the brutalist hotel is nothing more than an infinite stack of lobbies. That is so hateful. Sometimes they take you someplace else. Once, they took me to a large, dark cabin in a logging camp in winter, where my dead uncle threatened me with a revolver because he thought I was a Nazi. That was a long night. Many times they have taken me to the train station.

The stairwells themselves are almost totally dark. They contain most of the brutalist hotel’s phantoms. I also once met an old woman in a headscarf on one of the landings. The landings are as large as most people’s bedrooms. She was standing behind a folding table in the near darkness, selling a pitiful assortment of fruits and vegetables. She was nice to me. She chatted amiably about the quality of her produce, but it was all sad, mushy, and wrinkled. I fished a few cents from my pocket and bought a pear. Later, as I progressed up a flight of stairs, I accidentally dropped it. It rolled down the stairs and became lost in the darkness. I worried about that. I didn’t want her to find it and think that I had considered her pear not good enough. Not that I had had any intention of eating it: I just didn’t want her feelings to be hurt. My dreams often consist of my trying hard not to hurt or disappoint other people.

On one of the middle floors of the brutalist hotel is an open conference room. It has two sets of double doors that are always propped open. It’s actually not very large. It’s always dark in there. I don’t know if the lights work or not. I’ve never tried to turn them on. The floor is orange linoleum. The walls are white stucco, with a swath of beige around the bottom four feet. It is furnished with square particle board tables and straight back chairs.

The windows in the conference room are so hateful. I know, intellectually, that if I look out of them I will see nothing but a dark street, and a sidewalk lit by dim, yellow streetlights. Yet I dread those windows. They will show me the faces I see in the bathroom tiles, the faces the trees make through the thin fabric of my bedroom curtains during the morning of the hangover, the faces that dwell behind my eyelids during the night of the hangover.

On an upper floor of the brutalist hotel, behind an unmarked door, is a log cabin. I know. I’ve seen it. I was lucky enough to get there once. My dreams let their guard down. Now, they try to convince me I was mistaken, but I know that’s a lie. I’ve been there. I’m not foolish enough to think I’ll ever get back there, but my dreams will never convince me it was an illusion.

My Aunt Fay was in that cabin. She was just getting ready to go on a trip to Natural Bridge when I came bounding in. She said my name in surprise and laughed, as was her way in life. There was a creek rock fireplace with a roaring fire and an old gas range nearby. She heated up a can of Chef Boyardee Roller Coasters with meatballs in a battered old tin pan for me. Then my hateful dreams propelled me back to waking life. It didn’t take my dreams long to realize their error--but, still, they slipped up.

I think it’s on the same floor--maybe one above, maybe one below--where the dormitory wing is. It lies behind heavy steel double doors with frosted glass. It reeks of stale cigarette smoke, but no one is there anymore. The doors of the rooms are heavily padded and covered in maroon vinyl, studded with rivets, as if they were government offices. But they’re not: they’re dorms. I know because I once forced my way into one.

My dreams had played with my feelings one too many times. Every few months or so I get strength in my dreams. Despite the slow, underwater movements that confront almost everyone in these fearful situations, now and then we can power through, through our sheer frustration. I forced a padded door open and was confronted by a small entrance hall. To my left was a bathroom and a separate WC. In front of me and to my right were doors leading to the two bedrooms.

Moonlight shone through the frosted glass in the door in front of me, so that’s where I went. I opened the door and the cold moonlight spilled onto the coffee-colored linoleum. One twin bed was stripped and empty. The other contained a desiccated corpse wrapped in a heavy duvet.

The corpse raised its head and roared at me. I fled the room in terror.

I recount these episodes because they are a break from monotony. In reality, this is what the brutalist hotel means: monotony. Usually I see no more than the lobby, or the awful stairwell. I would actually like to explore the brutalist hotel more, but my hateful dreams rarely permit it. Still, I have deduced, through the mysterious omniscience that often accompanies one in dreams, that somewhere in this hotel there is a restaurant, and even a bar. I believe they are usually empty, but I have a slim hope that sometimes they are not.

I believe that everyone from my life--past, present, and future--is in the brutalist hotel, but it is so vast, I do not believe I shall ever find even one of them, apart from my Aunt Fay. The dreams really let themselves down with that one. Our dreams exist to make us miserable, of that I am convinced, and they will not let that brief, stolen beauty slide. That is why I fear death. I know, when the time comes, my dreams will carry me into the conference room, and force me to look out the dreaded windows, and wait to see whatever deferred horror I shall see.

I will wait for the faces, the whispers, the shadow at the foot of my bed, the dead classmate weeping in the armchair, and it will remain, forever, in the hallway, just out of sight.",1,1730756659.0,joinmeatthecampfire,0,1.0,False
1gjq6k3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/1gjq6k3/any_advice_at_all/,Any advice at all ,"Hi guys. This is a long one but if anyone has any advice it would be appreciated. 

2 months ago I got the nexplanon contraceptive implant in.2 weeks later I took a progesterone only tablet and the next day I woke up with the most debilitating fatigue I've ever had. I pushed through the week then on the Friday I had full flu symtpoms , numbness of arm and orthostatic intolerance. I was admitted into hospital for 7 days with many tests done that came back all clear. I asked could they do a hormone test to see was my progesterone high but they refused and said it was anxiety. 

I then went to my gp and she said either ME/CFS (I know it's only been 2 months I was confused too!) or the nexplanon. So I got it removed. 

2 weeks later after getting it removed my energy is a bit better but still struggling to keep eyes open they are droopy all day and no matter how much coffee I drink I'm exhausted. But I'm not sure if it's my hormones regulating. 

I would be worried that this is kind of a ""remission"" part of MECFS and I will relapse again or is it the hormones starting to regulate. 

And I know there are many people that suffer and have suffered for many years with the debilitating symptoms of MECFS and I don't want to seem like I am downplaying it. I just had a lot of symptoms correlating with it. Especially the orthostatic intolerance but that seems to have stopped.

Or am I SOL?,"I need some help understanding workflow and PCIE lanes for AM5 on the X670E and X870E boards. If there is a thread somewhere with this question already, I apologize and would love to see it.

My job is to work in photoshop and premiere on weekly projects. I use my computer for gaming and this work. I currently have a 4080 and an i9900K in my build. A very good friend gave me a 7950X3D for free (great guy) and now I'm looking to upgrade everything to use it.

Current set up is my computer with a couple drives and a NAS where I archive projects after they're completed. I'd like to clean up my computer hard drives and only have a M.2 for operating system and programs, another M.2 for intense games, and one last M.2 for my current projects (offload after) and keep one older HDD I currently have for casual singleplayer games.

I've seen a ton of boards with 3,4,5 M.2 slots but read that when utilized they take away from the graphics card Pcie bandwidth.

My questions are the following:

1. How much of a difference does x16 vs x8 make in gaming? Does it depend on the game?
2. Is this only Gen 5 M.2 slots? Can I solve this with Gen 4 slots?
3. What board would work best for my situation? I don't need USB 4, I can make a coffee and wait for transfer times
4. Can I tell the CPU or Chipset to use a lower amount of lanes for certain drives? Does that even make sense lol
5. Does any of this matter with my set up or am I making a big deal out of this because in reality it's going to be a 1-2% frame drop and only take 5 seconds extra load times for work/gaming?

Following a midlife epiphany and a long tango with crippling self-doubt and anxiety, Christie Browne finally decided enough was enough—it was time to inflict her lifetime of writing on the world. Though she still feels a bit presumptuous calling herself an author, Christie has been crafting character-driven fiction for as long as she can remember, spinning vivid tales faster than she can finish her morning coffee. Her stories are rich, emotional, and unflinchingly real, with a knack for storytelling that lingers and gets readers thinking. She’s now hitting 'publish' without waiting for the 'perfect time' (spoiler: it doesn’t exist). Spending more time in her head than in the present, she’s letting the world peek into her crowded, complicated, introverted, empathetic, and occasionally brilliant mind. When she’s not writing, you can find her rock hunting along Michigan’s coastlines, savoring a great cup of coffee, or dreaming up fresh ways to captivate readers in her next novel. Christie’s all about stories that entertain, inspire, and maybe make you question if you should’ve waited this long to finally pick up that pen yourself.",1,1730756487.0,selfpublish,0,1.0,False
1gjq46t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gjq46t/what_happened/,What happened?,"Hi, lately I've been wondering if maybe I have anxiety. In recent months I've had two experiences that could have been anxiety or panic attacks, but I'm not sure. I would really like some input on these situations.

Experience 1 (Kinda long-winded, sorry):

I was visiting Seattle with my mom, and as always when traveling I felt less comfortable than at home. On one day, I felt on-edge and jumpy in general but for no specific reason. It started with the eerily quiet vibe of our hotel that was patrolled by a security guard. Then later I saw a kid with his parents who were wasted on the sidewalk. After that, my mom and I visited a glass art museum. It was fascinating, but when I walked past an exhibit, all at once I felt super off-balance and not in control of my body. I had the sudden invasive thought that I could easily fall and smash into the intricate glass display. From then on I felt very uncomfortable and a little out of breath. Following the museum experience, I had another concerning thought when our car backed over a piece of trash. The idea popped into my head that it was a person or animal, which I know sounds insane.

Now, here is where I started to panic - if that's even the right term to use. Back at the hotel, my mom and I put on some TV. I felt very overwhelmed and I suddenly felt so, so incredibly scared. I started crying and went over to my mom. The draft in the hotel or other residents caused a distant sound that could have been doors opening and closing, but it started to terrify me. I thought I was going to die in that hotel room, and I was bawling uncontrollably. It was the most terrified I've ever been, even though nothing was actually wrong. At the worst point, I thought my mom maybe wasn't real while I was huddled up against her. God it was so scary; I hate to think about it.

The next day I was exhausted. My mom wanted to visit another, smaller art gallery. When I got inside, I got a little bit breathless and teary-eyed and was relieved when we left.

Experience 2:

This one is a lot milder. I recently stopped drinking coffee because of my nerves, but one day after school I couldn't resist a pumpkin cold brew. I drank it on my walk home. By the time I arrived, my nerves were really acting up, but it was nothing I hadn't felt before.

This is when things started to change. I was scrolling on my phone, and I came across an obviously fake video that spooked me nonetheless. It was stupid - about this guy who kept hearing his own voice talking back to him in his dimly lit apartment. I put my phone down, and my nerves started to bubble up. I started to see movements in the corner of my eyes that disappeared right away. I looked at my hands and they didn't feel like my own, so I tried to stop looking at them. There was a pulsing in my arm, and I felt a little breathless. I also had a minor pain in my chest, which I've read is a common panic symptom.

However, after maybe 5 minutes of sitting still and taking deep breaths, the symptoms subsided. It was not bad at all.

If you read this whole thing, I really would appreciate an opinion on these experiences; It would be very helpful. Thank you!",1,1730756474.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

He never told me he was this upset about it until the day he left. He moved in with his mom right away. He moved most of his stuff out. We were texting on and off the whole time, and he finally consented to meet for coffee two weeks ago. That week he came over three nights, spent the night, said he loved me, kissed me all of that.
That Friday he blocked me on everything. I have no way to contact him. I asked his mom for him to contact me because we still have bills in his name. 
I have no idea what’s going to happen. He sent mixed signals this whole time. He could need space and snap out of it or he could refuse to see me at all.

1gjpx85,https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/1gjpx85/a_product_that_actually_helps_me_and_isnt_made/,"A product that actually helps me, and isn't made with toxic petrochemical slop.","I've tried nizoral, I've tried other antifungals, I've tried so many topical treatments. None of them actually help with my scalp inflammation. My scalp gets literally sore and feels bruised when I touch it.

I've figured out that my flares are caused by foods. I am on a very strict diet of just meat and fruits and coffee. But when I do eat something that causes a flare, this is the only thing that helps treat the inflammation. Now it hasn't *cured* me, but considering other people here have cured theirs with topical applications, this is definitely useful.

It's called [bloo](https://trybloo.com/products/bloo-scalp-treatment), here are the ingredients

* 1.5g salicylic acid
* 3g baking soda
* 1g vitamin B3
* 1g taurine
* 500mg caffeine 
* 20mcg methylene blue

The formulation is based on a bioenergetic perspective, pioneered by the late biologist Raymond Peat, of boosting the metabolic rate of the skin cells in your scalp locally by supporting cellular energy production--thereby giving them the energy necessary to quell inflammation. If you didn't know, salicylic acid is essentially aspirin, and it has antifungal properties, as does methylene blue and vitamin B3. But all of these things boost metabolism and reduce inflammation.   
  
It's nonsensical to rely on weird un-pronouncable petrochemicals to do what vitamins and simple substances like this can achieve naturally and simply. Since the range of effects from boosting metabolic function are so broad, I imagine that this product can be used for all kinds of skin issues and not just seb derm, and based on case reports I've seen, the results are pretty good.

This is genuinely not a paid promotion or anything. I've been using it for several months, and it reliably nukes my flare symptoms whenever I use it. Not only that but it supports hair growth and makes my hair feel *genuinely healthier.* All of these ingredients are based on simple research and there are no crappy pointless ingredients added. I'm not gonna go and dig up every study to put here, but it's legitimate. If you wanted to save money you could even buy these ingredients individually in bulk and make it yourself.

You have to mix it with water. I just put it in a bottle with a narrow opening so i can evenly distribute it onto my scalp and rub it in. It *can* stain your bathtub if you concentrate it too highly since methylene blue is, well, blue. I leave it in for 5-10 minutes and rinse, but if you let it sit longer and wore a bathcap around the house I imagine that would help it incorporate into your cells more.

No, it won't stain your hair blue, I think if you're blonde then you'd have to worry more, but they also sell a version that's the same thing just without the methylene blue, so if you're concerned you can just buy that one.

You can use it several times a week or every day, I try to use it daily because I flare often. Long-term it'd be cheaper to buy all the ingredients individually and make it yourself.

Just thought I'd leave this suggestion here for people struggling. I really think it clears all of these expensive medications and even the prescription steroids people use which is definitely horrible for you long-term.",1,1730755999.0,SebDerm,1,0.67,False

This started about a month ago, when I had a couple of hypertensive episodes. It started randomly one night when I was going to sleep, and felt my blood pressure spike. Raised blood pressure persisted for a couple of days. While I did not feel any nausea or anxiety, I could definitely feel that my BP was elevated, since the tips of my fingers on my left hand were slightly cold. This ""attack"" of Hypertension has happened two more times, once when I was trying to fall asleep and once when I drank a cup of coffee.The peak BP I recorded was about 144/85, but I believe i hadn't recorded it correctly. Subsequent readings, during hypertensive episodes, while I believe I took them correctly, but haven't recorded, went up to 140 sys as far as I remember. I am a smoker (ecig), eat a lot of junk food and drank a lot of caffeinated beverages. At the time I concluded that caffeine was at fault, since over the past few months up to the hypertension I had drank a lot of energy drinks and coffee per day, which ammounted up to a gram per day. I had decided then that caffeine was at fault, and cut it out, switching to green tea (at lower amounts of servings), which has helped. After a few headaches, my BP has went back to normal, my fingers haven't been cold, and I havent had any hypertensive episode since. I felt great.
This problem has been replaced by another one: I had started to feel pain in my chest. The pain isn't like the one I have seen described about any heart condition. It isn't a tightness in my chest, and when I feel it I do not have any other symptoms, and it comes and goes. It is localised around my left nipple area, and mostly happens on the left side of my chest, at about nipple height, in my side. When it happens, it feels like someone is poking me there with their finger rather harshly in the ribs. Not extreme amount of pain, but rather discomforting. I do not feel anything when breathe, or move my arm. I do not connect the pain to my lymph nodes, as it occurs in a lower location than them, and there are no lumps or anything of note in the area. The pain is not constant, happening randomly as far as I am aware (I haven't conncted it to anything, and additionally I haven't been keeping track), but mostly in the evening an hour or two before I go to bed.
To manage it I started taking some heart drops, which are a traditional medicinal tincture containing valerian root extract and other herbs. The drops help, as I do not feel any pain when I take them. I took them for two weeks, but after some days it returned, but I believe less severe.
I believe the previous hypertension is connected to this pain in some way, yet I have no idea why it started, it just happened suddenly, and now that it doesn't happen there is some pain felt.
Previously I was diagnosed with a varicocele and leading up to the hypertension I took diosmin (1g/day) to help treat it, alongside a similar amount of rutin, and vitamin C. Currently for supplementation I take zinc (30mg/day), vitamin C (500mg/day), rutin (100mg/day) and Vitamin D & K2 (2000 IU & 100 micrograms every 2 days). I don't these affect anything substantially, but I feel like I must include them.

I recently got my hands on the e.l.f. Perfect Finish HD Powder, and I've been putting it through its paces. This compact little gem has become a staple in my makeup routine.

The powder feels silky smooth when I apply it. It glides on easily and doesn't cake up or look heavy on my skin. I've found it does a nice job of blurring small lines and giving my face a more even look. It's great for quick touch-ups during the day too.

https://preview.redd.it/mvrl68rhdyyd1.jpg?width=425&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d0a5610cf63ab357417785cf91e248c82e729fd

I like that I can wear this powder alone for a natural look or use it to set my foundation. It keeps my makeup in place pretty well. The compact size makes it easy to toss in my bag for on-the-go fixes.

One thing I really value is that it's cruelty-free and vegan. It's also free from a bunch of harsh chemicals, which is a big plus for me.

# Bottom Line

I think the e.l.f. Perfect Finish HD Powder is a solid choice for anyone wanting a smooth, matte finish. It works well and doesn't break the bank.

# Overview of e.l.f. Perfect Finish HD Powder

I recently tried this powder and was impressed by its performance. The e.l.f. HD Powder is a game-changer for my makeup routine. It blurs fine lines and gives my skin a smooth, flawless look. I love how it sets my foundation without looking cakey. The compact is perfect for touch-ups on the go.

One thing I noticed is that it works well for oily skin, helping to control shine throughout the day. It's also great for all skin tones, as it doesn't leave a white cast. The powder feels light on my face and doesn't dry out my skin.

I appreciate that it's cruelty-free and vegan. It's free from harsh chemicals, which is a big plus for me. While it does a good job blurring imperfections, don't expect it to completely erase all flaws. For the price, though, I think it's a solid choice for everyday use.

# Blurs Fine Lines & Imperfections

I was excited to try this powder for its promise of blurring fine lines. The compact is handy for touch-ups on the go. When I applied it, the powder felt smooth and soft on my skin. It did help reduce the look of some small wrinkles and pores. The finish was natural-looking and not cakey. I liked that it didn't change my skin tone or leave a white cast. For oily skin, it helped control shine for a few hours before I needed to reapply. While it didn't completely erase all my imperfections, it did give my skin a more even, polished look. The vegan formula was a nice bonus for those concerned about ingredients. Overall, this powder delivers on its main claims without breaking the bank.

# All-Day Wear

I found this powder to be a great choice for long-lasting wear. It kept my makeup in place from morning to night. The fine, smooth texture didn't cake or settle into lines as the day went on. I liked how it controlled shine without making my skin look dry or flat. Even after hours of wear, my skin still looked fresh and even-toned. The compact size was handy for touch-ups, but I rarely needed to reapply. This powder held up well through my busy days. It didn't fade or break down, even in warm weather. My makeup stayed looking good from my morning coffee to after-work drinks.

# Compact and Portable Design

I love how easy this powder is to carry around. The compact fits nicely in my bag without taking up much space. It's perfect for quick touch-ups during the day. The small size doesn't mean less product - there's still plenty inside. I can easily slip it into a clutch for nights out. The packaging feels sturdy, so I don't worry about it breaking in my purse. It's great for travel too. I just toss it in my makeup bag and go. The mirror inside is handy for on-the-spot checks. This powder's portability is a big plus in my book.

# Eco-Friendly and Ethical Choice

I'm thrilled with this powder's eco-friendly and ethical approach. It's cruelty-free and vegan, which is a big plus for me. I feel good knowing no animals were harmed in making this product. The compact doesn't use any harmful chemicals like phthalates or parabens. This makes it safer for my skin and the environment. I love that e.l.f. cares about these issues. It's nice to find a makeup item that works well and aligns with my values. The compact size means less waste too. I can easily take it with me and use it up before it expires.

# Pros and Cons

I found this HD powder to be a handy addition to my makeup routine. It does a good job blurring fine lines and giving my skin a smoother look. The compact size is great for touching up on the go. I like that it's vegan and free from harsh chemicals. It works well to set my foundation and control shine.

On the flip side, I noticed it can sometimes leave a slight white cast, especially on darker skin tones. The blurring effect isn't as dramatic as some might hope. It needs reapplying after about 5 hours, which isn't ideal for all-day wear. Some users with oily skin may find it doesn't control shine as well as they'd like.

# Customer Reviews

I've been using this HD powder for a few weeks now, and I'm impressed with its performance. Many users praise its ability to blur fine lines and create a smooth finish. The powder feels lightweight on the skin and doesn't settle into wrinkles. It's great for touch-ups throughout the day.

Some people with oily skin found it helpful in controlling shine. The compact size makes it easy to carry in a purse or makeup bag. A few users with darker skin tones mentioned it didn't leave a white cast, which is a plus.

Not everyone saw dramatic results, though. A small number of reviewers didn't notice much blurring effect. The matte finish might not be ideal if you prefer a dewy look.

Most users agree it's a good value for the price. It seems to last longer than some other powders. While it may not be perfect for everyone, many found it to be a solid choice for everyday wear.

# Conclusion

I've found the e.l.f. HD Powder to be a solid choice for setting makeup and blurring imperfections. It's easy to apply and doesn't leave a white cast on my skin. The powder helps control oil and keeps my makeup in place for hours. While it may not completely erase all flaws, it does a good job of smoothing out my skin's texture. The compact size is great for touch-ups on the go. For the price, this powder offers good value. It's not perfect, but it's become a reliable part of my makeup routine. If you're looking for an affordable setting powder that delivers decent results, this e.l.f. product is worth trying.",1,1730755796.0,bestbeautybuys,0,1.0,False

“Jesus answered. “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the father except through me” (John 14:6 NIV).

The above to many in the Christian community will be a recognizable bible verse. John 14:6 may even be known to those participating in a more secular lifestyle, or even to those involved in other religions. It is a formidable verse and provides the reader with a strong sense of how Jesus characterized his own being.

If Jesus is to be the Messiah as he so self proclaimed “Before Abraham, I was” (John 8:58 NIV). As is my belief, it is important to understand the metaphor’s he used to reveal his divine essence to his followers because “All scripture is god-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness” (2 Timothy 3:16 NIV). In my discovery, I BELIEVE, the metaphor’s the messiah uses to describe himself, are intentioned, to give us the reader and student insight into what spirits (all stemming from the same place) it is which we are to be worshipping EXACTLY.

“God is Spirit, and those of us who worship him must worship in SPIRIT and truth” (John 4:24 NIV). God is spirit, what does that mean exactly? In this case I have defined spirit as the animating or vital principle required to give meaning to existence, being and essence.

This type of spirit does bind itself with the living, physical world and throughout history we have given such spirits names to give notice to when they are with us or with others.

To explain this principle, I will begin by speaking about a strong spirit which reveals itself quite obviously in our world, love.

Throughout every translation of the bible the word love or as I see it, the spirit of love, is mentioned anywhere from 310 – 801 times within the biblical corpus. John reads “Anyone who does not love does not know god, because god is Love” (John 4:8 NIV). Here again we see another metaphor describing the spirt attributed to the biblical god.

In common use one might say they are “in love” to a partner or that they are “feeling the love” or when love seems absent from them, they might say “where is the love?” or “You won’t find love there” if it is perceived to be absent from a specific location. In common culture, most people understand, when this sensory emotion fills an individual’s physical body, they are physically animated into a new state, a loving state.

The secular scientific community would attribute said “loving state” to a physical need to reproduce and a desire to be safe.

I believe this to be too simplistic of an answer, although not completely off track. I believe it to be our allowance of the spirit of love to enter our soul. My reasoning, although compelled by the scientific community’s explanation is that if Love was only a physical response and not an animating spirit it could not be eternal rather, like all things which gratify human needs, such as a cup of coffee or the act of sex, it would have to be temporary. I will now try to the best of my ability prove loves eternal qualities.

“The lord appeared to him from far away. I have loved you with an EVERLASTING love; therefore, I have continued my faithfulness in you” (Jeremiah 31:3 NIV).

As supercilious as it might sound true love doesn’t fail and doesn’t end. Plato once wrote “Love is the desire for the eternal possession of the good.” I believe this description to hold plenty truth, so if we are considering love to be the spirit concerned with the eternal possession of good how may we begin to reveal such an eternal spirit within our lives. Well, as I see it, it should be by doing good or by seeing others do good.

In my proof of Love’s eternality, it should be first noted that to see or feel the spirit which we give the name love, manifest, we must begin, as a human being confined by certain faculties, attain the defined pre-requisites to do so. One, WE must be attentive to good actions in our lives and be attentive to other actions and 2) We must have the faculties to perceive loves effects on another or on other living organisms.

I will now provide an example of how we may with the two foremost pre-requisites attained, perceive the spirit of love. You, reading this, I want you to think about the time in your life whereby you felt the most love and I want you to imagine for a quick moment being back in such a moment. While you do that, I want to take notice about what you experience during that time. Do that for a couple of moments and then read the paragraph below.

Hopefully, if I am to be correct you experienced similar feelings of love that you had in that moment or possibly even greater ones. Now, the spirit of love has once again revealed itself to you. This is a practice which can be rehearsed at any time, and you should find, will regularly elicit the same emotions as you have just experienced.

This is a small example, but other examples may include random acts of kindness or charitable practices, which will also help reveal the spirit of love through you or others. What this might tell us is in any given situation where we have the faculties to perceive love and are attentive, the spirit of love lays dormant, like potential energy, until the proper good action is taken to reveal the spirits presence.

So, in this we begin to realize the eternal qualities of love which exist cloaked behind the physical reality waiting to be revealed to us.

Now, it is my belief, that it is not only love which is eternal and rests waiting to be revealed but instead countless spirits and so-called demons who wait to reveal themselves sometimes by the appropriate good action and sometimes through the dis-appropriate bad acts. Some examples of names we give such spirits include Death, Fear, Truth, Life, and Lust.

“The lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth” (Psalm 145:18). Here is an example once again of God asking us to call on a spirit named truth to access him. Now, with the knowledge of such names which God hereby uses metaphorically to describe the spirits which proceed from him we can begin to realize what we are truly called to worship when worshipping Christ Jesus.

So once again, I call back verse 14:6 from the gospel of John which reads “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the father except through me” (John 14:6 NIV).

Here Jesus has called himself by the names of three animating spirits. The Way, The Truth, and the Life. I believe it is in this verse we can begin to see how it is, we as Christians, are meant to worship Christ in this life. That indeed, is through taking the appropriate actions necessary to reveal these three spirits.

It should be noted that like The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit the three animating qualities and spirits Christ Jesus uses metaphorically to represent himself are also a trinity. It is again MY Belief that each of these spirits which Christ reveals in himself are the ways which the Trinity reveals itself to us in this life.

The Father reveals himself through the animating spirit of Life “Then the lord god formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils THE BREATH OF LIFE, and the man became a living creature (Genesis 2:7 NIV).  The Way, again, represents the spirit of Love and Sacrifice best attributed to The Son, “For God so much LOVED the world he gave his only SON, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16 NIV). Finally, the Holy Spirit can best be attributed and described as the spirit of truth “But when the helper comes, whom I will send to you from The Father, The SPIRIT OF TRUTH, who proceeds from the father, he will bear witness about me” (John 15:25 NIV).

Now it should be noted that if these spirits proceed from the father which here we represent through the spirit of Life, that it becomes for us to have LIFE (Our Father) we must BELIEVE in the spirit of LOVE (Christ Jesus) and in order to Love we must equip ourselves with The Spirit of TRUTH (The Holy Spirit).

This knowledge can help support the church’s mission in in creating as C.S Lewis puts it in Mere Christianity “Little Christs” as it helps bridge a communication gap concerning what it truly means to worship the Trinity, as now, we can begin to teach churchgoers that in order to be true followers of Christ you must always participate with our ENTIRE BEING and LIVES in the worshipping of Love, Life, and Truth in our secular lives to reveal the spirits which Jesus names The Way, The Truth, and The Life.

1gjppvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/stelo/comments/1gjppvq/6_weeks_with_stelo_long_post/,6 weeks with Stelo (long post),"I thought I’d share some of my experience using stelo for the past 6 weeks. 
Background: I was diagnosed with T2 diabetes earlier this year. My doctor basically said, “it’s not so bad. Eat less carbs. Consider taking statins. We’ll check your A1C in 6 months.” Zero education or offers for further testing. I had done research when I was first discovered to have pre diabetes and had been considering trying Dr. Westman’s treatment for diabetes. But I hadn’t actually done anything. I was really overwhelmed. When I got the T2 diagnosis, I asked for a CGM to help me and dr said I didn’t qualify because my A1C needed to be pretty bad. (At the time it was around 6.8.). So I left the appt and promptly did nothing about my diabetes. For 6 months the diagnosis was simmering in the back of my mind, and I knew I was going off the deep end, food-wise, and making things worse. 

About 6 weeks ago I was coming out of an illness and every morning I felt like I kept having a fever. Symptoms were chills, shaking, general malaise, sweating. The cold/flu should’ve been over, but I couldn’t stop sweating for days. One morning I decided to check my blood sugar. It was over 300. I’d never had a reading that high in all my life. I knew I had to make changes asap. I remembered reading that the stelo was coming out in the summer, so I decided to get it. I needed a good picture of what was happening in my body. 

I ordered 4 stelos. They came in two days. The first one I ended up ripping out of my arm on day four when I rammed myself into a door jamb. Do not recommend. I ordered over patches (called KOVOQ) with a little plastic covering on Amazon (recommended by a fellow Redditor) and they have worked perfectly for the rest of my CGMs. I’m now on my last CGM and all three of the remaining ones have worked perfectly. When I see a reading that seems surprising, I check it against a finger stick, and I haven’t had any crazy differences. Any difference are usually about 20 off, and usually when my BS is actively going up or down, so the delay makes sense. (the CGMs do need some time to warm up and become accurate). 

When I started using Stelo, my average daily glucose readings were coming in at 175-185. After a few days, I worked on changing my diet drastically. Only 5 weeks later my average daily readings are between 130-145. This is just due to diet changes. 

The Stelo has really helped me see where my trouble spots are. My fasting blood sugar was in the 170s when I started using it, and I was so frustrated trying to figure out how to get that down. After trying a few things, I’ve found that skipping dinner or an early, very low carb dinner helps drop my blood sugar before bed and it stays there all night. I have a pretty severe dawn phenomenon, and as soon as I get up my blood sugar starts shooting up. When my fasting sugar was 170, this proved to be a big problem. Especially when I drank coffee right away. (Actually, the first thing I learned from Stelo is that my body cannot handle caffeine before food). Now I know to eat a protein and fat-heavy meal early and my BS stabilizes. 

I used the Clarity app to print weekly Overlay charts, drew a line on the charts of approximate breakfast, lunch, and dinner times, and consider trends I see. I tend to snack between lunch and dinner and that start spiking my BS, especially if it’s the wrong food. Now I take a swig of pickle juice before having a snack, and it cures my cravings. Also note, if your BS is going above 250 or below 70, when you print your Clarity reports, you will be able to see how high and low you go. 

I think that’s about everything. In the midst of this process I redid my A1C and it was 7.7, which matched what Stelo said my likely blood glucose average was when I first started. I’m excited to keep using Stelo and see how my A1C improves over the next couple of months. I think CGMs should be approved for all pre diabetics. Every time I see a high number I think, “this is going to kill me,” and every time I see a nice low number (like 100), I think, “I’m going to live longer.” Highly recommend trying it out for yourself!

Is there a safe level, or will abstention create more issues?","Disclaimer posting this from NSFW account. 

My (M35), wife (F31) and I have started our IVF journey. I have a genetic condition I do not want to pass on to my children. She has said she doesn't want any drinking in front of kids before they are old enough to understand what it is. She initially suggested 10ish, though she did suggest maybe 6? (basically until they aren't reaching for someone's glass and doing the monkey see monkey do thing. But I also wouldn't give my children coffee at that age, she hasn't asked me to stop that.  

Some context, she never drank before she came here, (western country) before she met me , having grown up in an eastern country. Before we met, when she was studying she'd come home from university at 12pm on a lunch time and she was shocked by the number of people drinking. My country drinks quite a bit, my family maybe more than average. She and I met 1.5-2 years after she got here. She has said she could easily never drink again. My family are also quite big drinkers, before a meal, during and after (I'd argue that these events are rare but it's still binge drinking. If we are at somebody's place it could be hours. I acknowledge this constitutes binge drinking, as is FAR too much, and not behaviour I want my kids to emulate. 

I agree we should not drink in front of our kids in our home until they are old enough to understand. My issue is I do not think we can ask anyone else not to drink when at their place. I am also concerned about making it this hidden thing. She agrees with that but says she won't want the kids there then. I do not want them to miss family gatherings. Admittedly at 0-6, the only big one I am concerned about is Christmas. 

I am not trying to win an argument here, I am grateful she has made the concessions she has on the age just looking for advice on how to approach this, different points of view I may not have considered.

I didn't tell my coworkers about my boyfriend when I first joined my company (over) two years ago. I was wrong to do this, I know, but it was a secret from my parents at the time and I was scared it would get back to them through family friends who work at the same company. I lied and said I didn't have a partner when asked. I know this was very wrong.

I was going through a lot at the time. A few months after I started work, I gathered the courage to tell my (very traditional and religious) parents about my (interracial) relationship. I was guilted, emotionally blackmailed, threatened, and eventually disowned by my family for this- they also came to stay with me for a few months and tried to prevent me from leaving the house and actively shut down any mention of my boyfriend.  They did let me go to work but actively tracked where I was and made it difficult for me to do anything other than come home straight from work. 

Eventually my psychological state deteriorated to the point where I was constantly contemplating ending everything. I ended up just packing up my stuff and running away from the house. My parents finally left when I did that, claiming they meant no harm and that they just wanted the best for me. They continued to call me after, hoping I'd still change my mind. I realized there was no way out and I just had to make my own decision one way or another, otherwise things would never end. My boyfriend and I drove to the courthouse and signed papers and got married. It was a depressing thing - I cried the entire day, his family wasn't there and neither was mine. Just the two of us. As soon as I told my parents, they disowned me. They had kept in touch all the while hoping I would change my mind - and then severed ties the moment I ""betrayed"" them.

This was at the end of last year. Since then, my mental state has gotten better - I am slowly healing and although I have days where I am really lonely and miss my family, I've accepted that this is just how things are.

I didn't tell my coworkers any of this. I couldn't. 

Enter 2024. Earlier this year, my husband's parents wanted to have an actual wedding ceremony in their country and started to plan one, and asked us to just come - they'd take care of all the planning and arrangements. At this, I decided to tell my boss that I was ""getting married"", and told another coworker that I regularly work with. I treated this as my actual wedding.
So the wedding ceremony went well and I had a great time with my husband's family. It was a bit sad for me - my family wasn't there and nobody I knew was there - but I was still grateful to my husband's family for putting together this whole thing. I came back to to the US and got right back to work.

However, I didn't tell anyone else about the wedding, and part of this is that I didn't want to explain any of this depressing backstory to anyone. Andwithout the backstory I wouldn't be able to explain why I'm suddenly getting married when, two years ago, I said I didn't have a partner. One of these other coworkers also tends to schedule giant gatherings/parties whenever people get married, and I really wanted to avoid that too. I also thought about just telling people I met my partner two years ago (to avoid explaining all this backstory), but what if people found it weird to marry someone that quickly? I don't know what the norm is.

Unfortunately the coworker that scheduled the parties recently found out about my getting married/having a wedding and is extremely upset with me for being ""so secretive when she thought we were friends."" We've gotten coffee together a bunch of times and I really do consider her a friend - but it's been a lot for me 😔
I feel really bad and am also extremely anxious that she might end up scheduling a party against my comfort - and also that I don't know how to deal with this mess of a situation I created. 


tl;dr: I am a horrible person who was secretive about my boyfriend and wedding and don't know how to deal with the aftermath or what to tell my coworkers. Grateful for any advice.",16,1730755141.0,relationships,22,0.94,False

I really like the community behind the bullet and seeing how others roast on it seems beneficial. And the cooling tray with stirrer on the pro looks awesome! Since most of my batches will most likely be 400-600g I think I could get away with an m6 vs the m10 as well. 

Would love to hear people’s thoughts on this!

Adding that I currently have a nucleus link which I love, but have outgrown the 100g at a time batch since I have been roasting more for friends and family as well. I plan on keeping the link to do 50g sample roasts before roasting the larger batches. ",2,1730755005.0,roasting,2,1.0,False

1gjpcfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gjpcfp/i_feel_stupid/,I feel stupid ,"Essentially I had been seeing / taking to this guy for about 2 and a half months ( 4 dates total quite spread out). I told him I didn’t want anything casual and he told me in the beginning that he wasn’t sure what he wanted yet but would be happy to see where things go.

I haven’t seen him the past two weekends up to this one as he has been busy, (I have also but I would have been keen to see him somewhere between my own plans). I asked a question on here regarding what I should do as I didn’t feel like he was interested in me or anything serious with me and someone advised me to just talk to him. So I did - basically he said he did like me and was interested in me he had just been busy and I confirmed the same (though I am embarrassingly clear that I liked him anyway).

He then sets up a date for this weekend past and then on the afternoon of cancels saying he’s not doing great. I was annoyed and hurt tbh and was quite short with my response, after asking friends what they thought they told me to not be so hasty or blunt because he could be being honest, so I apologised for the blunt response and said I hoped he felt better. He said he didn’t want to see anyone right now and wanted to be left alone for a while.

Another guy asked me out for coffee the next day via an app, it was one of those talk for a few hours and straight to a date vibes but I thought why not considering I’d been blown off for the last three weeks.

It was a nice date and the second guy seems really nice! But as soon as the date was over guy #1 replied apologising and said he felt better already and felt bad about what happened… I said I was glad he was doing okay but it kinda hurt to get cancelled on like that - he just kind of kept moving the conversation on without acknowledging it.

Both of them have texted me today and I’m not sure what guy #1 is doing. I don’t like dating two people at the same time and I feel like guy 1 has made me feel a bit dumb and yet the thought of ending it has me anxious and sad. 

I’m not sure what advice I want because I know I should end it with guy 1 since he clearly won’t end it with me for some reason, the thought of it is making me sad which isn’t like me at all I suppose and that’s why I’m confused.",3,1730754560.0,dating,1,1.0,False

1gjpbfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/LatterDayTheology/comments/1gjpbfs/a_thought_experiment_harvard_archaeologists/,A thought experiment:  Harvard archaeologists discover and translate the golden plates instead of Joseph Smith,"To remove the BOM from its charged religious context, let's imagine:

>The golden plates were discovered by Harvard archaeologists in a dig in the Yucatan peninsula.  Imagine further, that they deciphered the text by referencing Hebrew and Egyptian characters and glyphs, and the translation produced thereby was very, very close to the current text of the BOM.

Now, I sense that some of our critics may be choking on their coffee right about now.  And, indeed, the point of this thought experiment is to tease out exactly what caused them to choke, to understand why they might consider this thought experiment impossible.

**False Anachronisms**

Critics point to many historical anachronisms as evidence that the text of the BOM  is modern.  By ""historical anachronisms"" I mean, specifically, items included in the text for which our modern scholarship has not found in the purported historical context.  Examples would be steel in ancient America, horses, elephants, pre-Christian concepts of atonement and graces, codex, second Isaiah, and so forth. Although these are commonly labeled anachronisms, that is a false characterization.  By way of example, until the 1990s, steel in 600BC Jerusalem was thought to be anachronistic, but steel has since been found in that context.  And if steel is not anachronistic now, *it was never anachronistic.*  That's why I used the heading ""false"" anachronisms.  A better word might be ""putative"" anachronisms.

The vast majority of anachronisms raised by critics are this sort of false anachronism.

These false anachronisms all cease to be anachronistic in our thought experiment. Because if the BOM is ancient and authentic, it becomes the best scientific evidence for these items existing in their purported time and place.  If you believe, as I do, that the BOM is, in fact, authentic, you believe that there were horses and steel and so forth in the purported BOM context and that these items will eventually be borne out as scholarship catches up.  Consequently, a critic's haranguing about these items seems to me a bit like the droning school teacher from Charlie Brown:  wwaaa-waah-wa-wuh.

**Invisible Anachronisms** 

By ""invisible anachronisms"" I mean, specifically, things that should be there, but aren't. These are harder to tease out, because it requires a bit of imagination. Poor examples might be middle eastern DNA or steel relics.  Another might be cities matching the descriptions in the BOM.  But to my mind, a stronger example would be something like the wheel. On no basis but my own judgment, I think any culture exposed to a technology like that would immediately adopt it and its adoption would quickly become wide spread. It's a powerful technology, and even a child could reverse engineer it. Likewise, I think no culture possessing the wheel would ever abandon it. 

If the BOM is truly ancient, then, an explanation needs to be given why this sort of thing was not found in pre-Colombian America.  I'm not aware of any such explanation.  Perhaps the terrain was not susceptible?    

But stipulating the BOM is ancient requires one to accept the proposition that a technology such as the wheel (or such other invisible anachronism) was not adopted by the ancient Americans, even though the Lehites would have brought it with them.  This sort of invisible anachronism is not inconsistent with they hypothetical.  Who can say what should be there and what shouldn't. But it does raise questions a believer should reckon with.

**True Anachronisms**

By ""true anachronisms"" I mean, specifically, an item in the BOM text so uniquely associated with the 19th century that it could not possibly be part of an ancient text. A strong true anachronism might ""bust"" the thought experiment. If the coffee was choked, it should be here. 

I can only think of possibly one of these--the presence of text from the KJV.  Can anyone think of others?

Let's just suppose, though, that those hypothetical Harvard scholars translated those plates into a mostly word for word version of the Sermon on the Mount, as found in the KJV.  Just like a Rolex watch embedded in the stomach of a T-Rex fossil, it *begs* an explanation. And if the fossil is authentic, aren't the only two explanations for that Rolex?  Site contamination or time travel?  

Following that analogy, if the BOM text is authentic, the presence of KJV language seems similar to that Rolex, as due either to site contamination (JS injecting the anachronism) or time travel (God injecting an anachronistic text into the text).  Doesn't belief in the authenticity of the BOM text require us accept one of those two explanations for KJV text?  I favor site contamination because it seems more plausible than Christ delivering a sermon to ancient Americans using nearly identical wording to the sermon as would be rendered years later in the KJV.  Meaning, JS seeing a sermon very similar to the Sermon on the Mount and then cribbing or drawing from memory the words of text he was familiar with.

Last, returning to the Rolex, I'll note that the presence of a true anachronism such as a Rolex does not prove the T-Rex fossil is fake.  It only proves that the Rolex is out of place.  Likewise, KJV language does not prove the BOM text is all modern; only that the anachronistic portion may not have an ancient source.

Getting gas at QuickChek is going to get way more annoying.,"As of this month (actually, I think officially Oct 27th or something), QuickChek has changed their rewards program to an annoying system similar to Dunkin. I'll reserve my rant on that for now (suffice to say, I'm not a fan of the ""points"" system, and instead prefer the straight-up ""you keep getting various rewards both monthly and as you buy stuff"" that they used to have).

Instead, I'll focus on the gas. I pulled in today to the one in South Bound Brook, and requested a fill. While punching it in, suddenly the attendant says ""Do you have a rewards phone number?""  (Apparently, the pumps have been changed to constantly ask for that information now, as gas is part of the rewards system.) I started talking to the guy while the pump was going (there was maybe one other car in the station at the time, being attended to by someone else), and I mentioned that this sounds like something better suited for self-serve/pump-your-own. He agreed, but the company that now owns QuickChek (bought them a couple of years ago) is based in Florida, and therefore has no idea how stuff in NJ works.

He was complaining that, before the change over, he could easily attend to 4-5 cars per minute (in terms of taking payment and getting the pump started). But now, because of the rewards question and other minor changes to how the system works, he's lucky if he can do a single car per minute. And that's assuming that something doesn't go wrong, such as an incorrect phone number given, because then he has to reset the transaction and start from scratch, including swiping the card again. (The ""skip rewards"" button apparently \*only\* exists right up front; once you input anything, even if it's wrong or doesn't exist, there's no way to skip over it later.)

So if you regularly go to a QC gas station, and it seems to be taking unusually long for the attendants to handle things, it's probably due to FL attempting to make us more like them.

It's my first real relationship and I am unsure if it is a good idea to have a scheduled catchup in one year.

She is going traveling in 1,5 months, and has lately realised that she lacked a feeling of butterflies and romance in the relationship, and was unsure if we were supposed to be together forever, since we have never had relations or been intimate with other people. She told me about her feelings, how she started to feel alot better when other people complimented her, and stuff like that.

I am a bit lost, and might have seen the relationship through rose tinted glasses. We had talks about moving in together, decorating and apartment and all that, so it comes a bit as a suprise for me. We didn't have any arguments or other eventfull interactions before this, so I am sure that it is serious and not an impulsive decision. I do not know how to cope properly, and how to get through this easiest possible.

We both agreed on a coffee catchup in 1 year, but I am beginning to doubt whether this is a good thing. She told me she really appreciated me, and would love to still be apart of each others lives in some sort of way if I wanted to. She never betrayed me, she made me happy and this has been 3 great years. I hold no feelings of hate towards her.

There was a dude in line ahead of me, and we were both getting frustrated. I tried to call the Station's number but no answer... As I was calling, guy in front gets out and goes inside.

About two minutes later, out he comes, followed by a staff member and a little old lady carrying a cup of coffee from the station in one hand and a cane. It turns she was barely using in the other. It takes her like five minutes to get into the car, get back out to enter her code, get back in and eventually into the wash.

In the last month, three of the people I went to school with got engaged, my best friend just told me he and his wife are having a baby, and I'm just... here.

I live in a town of about 3,000 people, mostly retirees, but about a 30 minute drive from a mountain ski and college town of about 300,000 people. I'm not much of a drinker and I don't smoke anything. Introverted, but I try to get out and do things. In the last few years I've fallen in love with traveling. I've been to 19 countries, and I now run a youth program taking kids overseas. I'm finishing up my bachelor's after a hiatus due to COVID. I live at home with my parents right now, but am actively remodeling a house that I will move in to in the next year or so.

I am very handy, and my dad raised me to be able to fix most things. My mom raised me to bake and cook, and I'm fairly competent in the kitchen (if I'm not in a rush). I like hiking and I love animals, I ride my bike in the summer and while I'm not thin - I'm also not obese. I'm moderate/left leaning these days and not into the idea of restricting women's rights. I've had a solid job for the last few years, with a likelihood of advancement to a director position and a good salary.

Writing this all down, it makes me feel like at least for the most part I'm doing things right. But in the realm of dating, it's a desert. I get maybe one like online a month, and most of those are from people who are really not my type. Mostly open relationships and single mothers with very adversarial bios. The couple of dates I have been on in the last year and a half went nowhere - even when I thought there was good compatibility with two of the women I went out with.

In person, the one bastion of women my age in my town is the local coffee shop. But they all work there and I feel like  the friendliness is most likely just their service persona at work. I've thought about going in and just writing on my laptop with the hope of starting a conversation with someone, but again I'm hesitant to just hang out for no reason and be creepy.

1gjouci,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lifepluscindy_snark/comments/1gjouci/lodanes_in_love_with_the_cringe/,Lodanes in love with the Cringe?,"So I’ve been rewatching some older videos (due to someone posting an old video here, I went back down the rabbit hole, there are SO many better things I could have been doing! 😫) but I noticed a few things. Some of them were have likely discussed before but anyway…

A never sent flowers:

I know this was heavily questioned at the time but I believed A was having doubts and possibly did send them, Cindy clearly has a weird thing around flowers, the way she cried of the dying roses from A, clung to a rotting bouquet from Limbz for months even though she had dated him for less time than she had them, yet the ones she got during her breakup where she was in so much pain she couldn’t function, vanished within days? - not a chance.

The cot in the cabin 

When Cindy got to Arkansas with A they stayed in the famous cabin with him (now I thought this place had seen more action than an Arnie movie) but if you watch that video, Cindy explains there’s a spare bed you can use and later you can see it’s set up in the living room where A is sitting texting. He clearly wasn’t sharing a bed with her. That whole trip was so rushed and he was so checked out, it was beyond obvious he just desperately wanted rid of her- something I felt at the time, but the flowers confused me.

Lodane is in love with the cringe

Omg I can’t believe I never noticed this before but she is beyond super Stan status in those early videos, it’s quite clear she has a thing for Cindy. Lugging her bags around, bringing her coffee, commenting on the romantic ambiance. Waiting in the parking lot of a dizzard concert alone while Cringe desperately ensures she’s seen, photographed and videoed with another man at the concert of her ex who doesn’t want her, favourite band. Now there’s nothing wrong with Lodane liking her, I just can’t believe I didn’t spot it. Cindy probably loves this as she gets to exist in main character energy constantly. It’s also interesting how when Cringe met Todd l, Lodane was suddenly very depressed to the point where it was highly noticeable in the vlogs, we were just told “she’s going through some shit”.

She was lovely at one point

Around the time of the crystal mining vlog, I couldn’t help but notice how sweet and endearing Cindy seemed, it reminded me why I ever originally liked her, she was still depressed about A but was trying to be strong and independent, going on hikes and meeting new friends, she was so well spoken, well mannered and relatable in those couple of videos that I actually wondered if that’s who she truly is and the rest- just a defence mechanism. About two blogs later she admits she had been started on Wellbutrin. Mystery solved I guess.

There were tons more observations but this is already a novel!

Very interested to see how the next season plays out but so far all I see is her doing all the same things A complained about, losing her independence, her interests and any personality she had of her own, rewatching the breakup makes me realise that’s a very harsh lesson to learn twice.",19,1730753341.0,Lifepluscindy_snark,1,0.91,False
1gjoubb,https://i.redd.it/bmzrm2y96yyd1.jpeg,My approach to increasing insulin sensitivity,"I keep reading research about insulin sensitivity and its relationship with health - health and I've never been diagnosed with any kind of metabolic disorder - but I want to stay healthy as long as possible, so I figure, as long as it's not going to actually harm me, why the hell not? 

I began intermittently fasting at the same time as beginning this supplement regimen. I eat between the hours of 11:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. I'm not completely strict about this - I have a little half and half in my coffee in the mornings, so I'm probably getting up to 100 calories my outside of my eating time, and every now and then I do 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. if necessary based on how the day goes. 

My diet has been very good for years, I'd say 90% Mediterranean diet with a little too much red meat. Very difficult living in the United States to not just consume a bunch of red meat just by way of people giving it to you! I'm good about turning down processed carbs, have been for years. But it's hard to turn down a steak. I have yogurt, blueberries, and walnuts for breakfast pretty much every morning. I eat a crapload of vegetables, dark leafy greens, beans, etc. I don't count calories, and I've been running overweight for many years now. I'm a 39 year oldan right at 200 lb, 5'11, and I'm not muscular. I have been at about 200 lb for at least 3 or 4 years, sort of fluctuating between 195 and 205.

I have an extremely sedentary lifestyle. I work from home and I'm in tech. All of this diet, supplements, it's all ridiculous because I haven't habitualized an exercise regimen at all. I realize that this is all absolutely absurd because of this. However, as I'm getting older, I'm getting much better at my ability to institute new habits. For example, my diet: I was shocked at how easy it was to implement the intermittent fasting. I used to snack all day and all night and be uncontrollably hungry. They were healthy snacks, but they were all extra calories at odd hours. I have been able to stick with this intermittent fasting virtually perfectly (except for the half and half in my coffee.) I would have thought that my food cravings outside of eating hours it would have been uncontrollable. But they haven't been at all. I wonder if the supplements are helping with that. 

I've been dreaming every single night since beginning the supplements - I think it's the magnesium. This is based both on my research and on when the supplements arrived from Amazon and I began taking them.

I have lost a few pounds in the past week but nothing crazy. I am shocked at how low my appetite is compared to how it was before. I realized I should have had blood work done before and after starting any of this stuff... But again, if I don't have a regular exercise schedule, what's the point? That's the next step. That really should have been step one. But oh well. I've got two kids and another one on the way so that's my excuse? I have no excuse. My wife is extremely supportive and wants me to exercise. It's kind of hard to just leave her with two young kids to go exercise - that's how I psychologically block myself from doing it. But she's been extremely encouraging and that is going to happen next. 

I don't know why I'm posting this. I guess getting excoriated by this community for not having an exercise regimen in place before doing any of this stuff is a necessary step for me. These particular supplements represent my what I believe have the best evidence for increasing insulin sensitivity and thereby health/longevity. 

I've got the diet down, I've got the sleep down, I know I did it backwards. Next is exercise. At the very least, just walking briskly for 30 minutes a day but I'm thinking high intensity training and strength training throughout the week. I enjoy lifting weights and bicycling as well as tennis, but I was never able to turn these into habits the way I did with diet and sleep. 

Here's the time and dose for the supplements I'm taking:

Wake up at 6:30AM

7:30AM:
4 g Taurine
300mg Alpha Lipoic Acid

11am:
Breakfast
1280mg Omega-3 (fish oil)
2g creatine 
50mg vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol)
500mg Beta Glucan 1,3/1,6
30mg Zinc (Zinc Gluconate)
350mg Resverateol
550mg Berberine Photosome
500mg Amla


6:30PM
Dinner
200mg Magnesium (Magnesium Bisglycinate)
200 mg L-Theanine
2g creatine
500mg Beta Glucan 1,3/1,6
350mg Resverateol
550mg Berberine Photosome
500mg Amla
300mg Alpha Lipoic Acid
1280mg Omega-3 (fish oil)

I'm embarrassed about all of this. As far as I'm concerned, the supplements that I'm taking are only slightly better than superstition - especially in the context of not having habitualized exercise first. But, I think, humans are superstitious animals. Why shouldn't I allow myself a little superstition?

(sorry for the long read),"So it has been almost three months now since my girlfriend suddenly broke up with me, even tho we were planning on moving in together, citing reasons I had never heard before about how I was living my life and how ‘it would destroy her to stay with me’. We were having a fight in the week leading up to this, and when she came over to talk, I thought we were just gonna talk out the fight, but she just broke up with me in a talk that lasted maybe half an hour, and then she went to work. She said she loved me and cried when she broke up. She also texted me right after that I should take care of myself and shouldn’t do anything stupid. I was heartbroken and just cried a lot in the days after that, and even tho I never responded to her last message or tried to reach out to her, she still blocked me on most social media a few days later.   
  
I went no contact for about a month and when I was done crying about it, I started working really hard on myself and becoming a better person. Then I heard from a friend that she had reached out to him, asking how I was doing and saying that her friends discouraged her from reaching out to me, ‘as much as she would like to’. This prompted me to reach out to her a week after that, on a social media platform she hadn't blocked me on. I told her I heard from my friend that she asked about me, and that I was open to talk if she wanted to. We talked a little bit and I told her about all the work I had been doing on myself, she then said that she was open to grabbing a coffee with me and talking about it, but that she needed more time,’ so maybe in a month or so’. This was back in September and the talk still hasn't happened yet. Since then, we talked sporadically about casual stuff, with her kinda switching between being open and communicative and being cold and distant. In a talk we had a few weeks ago I told her again about all the work I had done and she said she was very proud of me, but she again became colder and more distant as that conversation went on, so I decided to cut it off by saying I had somewhere to be.   
  
I didn't hear from her for 2 weeks after that and thought that was it. But then on my birthday last week, she was suddenly the first to text me at just past midnight and wish me a happy birthday (via WhatsApp where she had blocked me up until that point). This really threw me off, because I wasn't expecting that based on our previous conversation. I responded with a thank you the next day, but she didn't follow up with anything, and I again haven't heard from her since then, but I remain unblocked. I just don’t know what to do right now, because I really miss her and still love her a lot, so I really want to win her back. I did a lot of work on myself and now that it has been a couple months, I have also realized the mistakes I made and I really want to fix things, or at least apologize to her for my part in everything. I still feel really sad most days and I kinda want to reach out to her and just tell her that I miss talking to her, and see if maybe she still wants to get that coffee, but I don’t know if it’s a good idea. Can I even get her back at this point? Should I wait for her to contact me again or should I just go for it and just put myself out there?

In August this year, the choice of quitting coffee finally seemed less painful than suffering for two weeks out of the month, so I quit. I had one last terrible really luteal phase in August. September was OK. In October, I was able to focus and get work done during my luteal phase. My meds even worked somewhat!

To be fair, there are a couple other things I've also started that could be helping: I've been taking berberine every day for the past two months, and starting occasionally supplementing with chasteberry extract in my smoothies. 

Also, this might sound silly, but in September I had a talk with my body where I promised to listen to what it was trying to tell me. I know that I have PMDD because there are pieces inside of me that I need to heal and love, and I shouldn't just power through or ignore them. Ever since, I feel like we have been cooperating. 

I still drink some form caffeine most days: generally green, white, or pu-erh tea. I also drink maté when I really want to focus. 

\*Edit\*: I can't believe I forgot that I also started seeing an acupuncturist every other week in September for PMDD/ADHD. This might actually be helping more than the quitting coffee - I am not a scientist.",6,1730753128.0,PMDDxADHD,1,0.88,False

I don’t want to date within my friend group, gym, university, or anywhere it could get awkward if things don’t work out. Been there, done that—I'm not a fan of the drama.  
So, I decided to try Hinge. I like that no one in my circle knows the guys I’m talking to, and if things fizzle, I won’t have to run into them.  

After a tough heartbreak and a few disappointing relationships/situationships  (love-bombing, lying, future-faking—the usual),  I now never believe anything a man tells me, and I am really careful about trusting them. I’m more guarded now and try not to get emotionally attached too quickly. I've been casually dating a few people to keep things light, without getting overly focused on one person until I feel like taking things further.
My goal right now is to enjoy some cute dates (no hook ups)  and look for someone whose actions match their words, rather than just believing what I hear.

So here’s where I meet this guy:  
I matched with a 31-year-old, 1.95m, good-looking doctor.  
We started chatting, and after a few messages, he said he didn’t enjoy texting too much and would rather meet for coffee.  
Setting a date wasn’t easy with his work and sports schedule (he’s really into kickboxing, trains daily, and is super fit). He suggested Tuesday, but I already had plans (a date with a really nice guy, our fourth, making sushi together—the kind of guy I probably *should* focus on). So, I suggested Wednesday. He was unsure because of work and training, but he tried to make it work, and we planned to meet at 7 p.m. after his training. 

Even before the date, I noticed a few red flags, like how he wanted me to come to his area and how our plans were a bit up in the air, didn’t set solid plans—just a vague “we’ll see” kind of thing. I actually thought about canceling because I had this weird feeling, but that day I was feeling down and thought going out might be a nice distraction. I figured, “Why not go and enjoy the company of a tall, handsome doctor?”

We met outside his gymWe walked to the city center, where there are lots of bars, and chose a cozy spot to sit and talk. It was a pretty standard first date in terms of conversation topics and vibe.

Things started to feel off when he brought up dating, talking about how his friend was focusing on one girl and how often people see each other. To me, it felt like he was trying to subtly lead me on. Basically, the typical sweet talk to make a girl feel special. I was honest and told him I wouldn’t believe a word of it if a guy said that to me. I think he realized I wasn’t falling for it After that, the conversation shifted, and we started to genuinely get to know each other.

After a while, he offered to read my palm and took my hands to “read” them. I thought, “Nice trick to get closer.” Then he compared our hand sizes, saying, “yours are so small, mine are so big,” and kept holding my hands. Even though I knew what he was doing, I’m just a girl—I found it cute.

When our drinks were done, he suggested getting a bottle of wine and going back to his place, which was conveniently around the corner. That’s when I thought, “Yep, here it is.”
This confirmed all my suspicions.

I considered what to do now. I don’t like to sleep around. I love sex, and if I really like someone, I do that. But for that, he has to be really special (either I really like him, or I find him really attractive, or both, or it’s a one-time opportunity).

In the end, I decided to go with him. In my mind, I thought of some kissing, cuddling, making out, as I hadn’t done that in a while, and I was really attracted to him. The joke is on me… If I’m that attracted to someone, I know I can’t say no, and this man screamed sex for me. His pheromones, everything. But I was somehow convinced that I could hold back…

I knew he probably does this regularly with multiple girls, charms them, and is sweet to them… and the girls fall for the sweet, handsome, tall, older doctor. So I knew I was doing this because I really wanted sex with him and knew we probably wouldn’t talk again, maybe have sex again, maybe not. I was actually okay with that. I’m not that naive, and it was pretty obvious to me.

So we did it… and it was amazing; I don’t regret it at all. He was also really interested in cuddling and talking afterward. He said, “Just because I get intimate with a girl quickly doesn’t mean I’m not interested in her.” He shared that he’d made some strong connections with women after similar situations in the past. I wasn’t entirely buying it—guys say that kind of thing all the time. He also talked about how he enjoys his freedom and isn’t looking to settle down or move in with anyone soon, and I get that too.

(Overall, we only drank 1.5 glasses of wine, so that was all me.)

In summary, I was a little confused, but I thought, whatever, I’ll probably never see this guy again. I even thought we wouldn’t exchange information (Instagram or numbers) and that would be it, and we’d see if he writes to me again on hinge or not. When we got dressed, I actually told him that I only see him as someone I could occasionally have sex with, but I said it much nicer( since I have someone like you, I can come to your place). 
He actually asked me for my Instagram before I left, liked all his pictures with my phone, liked all my pictures and then I left. In the next 1.5 to 2 weeks, I was really busy and got my period, so I had no reason to text him, and he didn’t reach out to me either. That was fine with me. But I posted two stories of myself, and he liked them (this might be important!). But I thought, whatever, I obviously I know he likes how I look, and he would sleep with me again, but he didn’t write to me for a second date, so I didn’t care.

At the earlier mentioned nearly two-week mark, I really wanted to see him because … . After he liked my stories, I felt confident enough to just ask if I could come over. So on Tuesday, I texted him: “Hey, I really want to see you.” He replied pretty quickly: “Friday night?” I was like, “Yes!”

Fast forward to Thursday. I was on a first date with another guy when the doctor texted me: “Do you have time to come over today? I don’t know if I can still make it work tomorrow.” I saw his text pretty late. When my date came to an end, I texted the doctor, “I can come if it’s not too late; I could be there in an hour.” (It was 9:30 PM.) He replied, “That’s totally fine.”

I arrived at his place, and being the asshole that I am, I told him I’d been on a date before coming over. He responded, “So I guess it wasn’t that good.” I said, “No, it was good. He actually already texted me again. But my dates never end the way ours did, especially if I want something serious or see something serious in someone. That’s why I got you; this is nothing serious to me, and I’m also not tempted to do anything stupid.” (Because the doctor knows I love to have sex, but not with random people.) He just chuckled.

So we had a great time. Again, he grabbed me for cuddling and talking afterwards. He asked about my date, and I told him I like to date multiple people to avoid getting too close to one, but I only let him kiss me. No big deal. He agreed, saying it’s good to have multiple options and not get too invested, especially if you don’t know someone for too long.
Then he went into the same spiel about how getting intimate quickly doesn’t mean he’s not interested in getting to know a girl. I told him it’s hard for me to trust guys’ intentions, and he seemed to understand, because that’s not the norm and how it usually goes (and him knowing about me being the other woman without knowing and how that guy had love-bombed me and introduced me to his family and friends)

We also talked about how he didn’t like to go on many dates without getting intimate. He thought that, in his mind, some guy had already gotten the girl on the first date, and he didn’t want another guy to achieve that while he couldn’t. I told him I had actually never done that; it was my first time. It only happened once before, but I was really heartbroken at the time and didn’t want a relationship. The guy I was seeing didn’t either; he was just hot, and I didn’t like him personality-wise, so we decided to have a casual thing and see each other when we had time. We talked a little more, and then I left. 

After I told him it was nothing serious that night, he stopped liking my stories (which could be important!).

One week goes by.
Now I was in a dilemma. I really wanted to see him and have sex with him, but since I had texted him first last time , I felt weird about messaging him again, especially since he hadn’t liked my stories. I thought to myself, “Suck it up, girl; you won’t message him!” I didn’t! But suddenly, the next morning, I saw that I got a DM from him. It said: “You don’t want to know what I dreamed about you last night.” I was super excited, thinking it must have been something spicy.  but then he said it was about us breaking into a supermarket and stealing candy. I played along but hinted that he’s the “only candy I want,” hoping it might lead to us seeing each other again.

Of course, he immediately responded, “That’s the right answer, baby. Do you want to come over tonight? I’m home at 8 PM.” I said yes. That night, I was also at dinner with a guy, so it fit perfectly into my schedule. I could just go to his place before heading home (the doctor lives super close to me). 8 PM would also be around the time I knew my date would probably end.

But then he texted, “So sorry, can you come at 10 PM? I won’t make it before that because I have to do something for work.” I was annoyed because he wanted to change plans again, thinking he could probably get away with it. I tried to convince him to meet at 9 PM, but he insisted he wouldn’t be home. I said, “But that’s a stupid time. I’m at dinner, and it would have been perfect at 8 because 10 is too late. I wouldn’t be able to do anything in the meantime.” I also couldn’t go home and then to his place. So he suggested 11 PM. I replied, “Fine, I’m in a traffic jam anyway.” (I was stuck in traffic, so it kind of worked out)

But here’s where my problem starts: I never took this man seriously. I never believed him. I always thought he was just sweet-talking, trying to make me like him more, maybe so I would start chasing him and texting him for his ego.

While we were lying there, him really wanting to cuddle, he asked again, “How are your dates?” I answered honestly, “I’m kind of annoyed; maybe I’ll cut everyone off. I’m not sure if I still want a relationship.” He said, “I totally get that. It’s hard after being single for a while to let someone into your life and change it, especially if you enjoy your life and like how it is at the moment.” 

I replied, “Yeah, true. But I would want one because of sex and cuddling regularly.” He kindly said, “But you’re getting sex.” I responded, “But that’s not the same. It’s more regular in a relationship; you see each other more often and for longer. The way we do it is kind of more complicated than a relationship.” 

So I asked him about his dating situation, alluding to the other girls. He started talking about starting a family, saying he sees himself there in 2, 3, or 4 years, getting more serious and having kids at some point (not what I wanted to know, but okay). Then he went off on how getting intimate fast doesn’t mean anything. I asked, “I know, but what about dates? I know you’re a little dating queen yourself, so don’t even try to deny it. Do you always do the same, or when do you start to invest more?” 

He said, “Well, I kind of give what I get. It depends on the messaging.” (I thought, okay, since we don’t do that, he obviously doesn’t want to date me.) “If the girl is texting me and asking if we want to do something, then I would also ask her.” I replied, “Hmm, okay.” 

He continued, “I just give back what I receive. If she doesn’t see anything serious and acts like that, then I do too. But I think a lot of connections don’t work because the girl isn’t taking the guy seriously. She thinks he’s just trying to seduce her to get her to sleep with him, and that’s it. But that’s not always the case. Sometimes the guy wants to get to know the girl more afterwards, but she’s already made up her mind about him and the situation. The girl totally misjudges the guy. I think a lot of situations fail because of this.”

I only managed to respond, “Hmm, maybe. This is all really complicated. Like really complicated. I don’t know.” As I was saying this, I moved a little, and he hugged me tighter, saying, “yeah.”

You can probably guess my new problem now. We talked a little more, and at one point, I said, “Well, I have to leave; we both have to wake up pretty early.” 

Today, while I’m writing this, it’s Monday, and all of this happened on Friday night. We haven’t texted since. I liked one of his stories on Saturday because I thought maybe he wanted me to do more, but he didn’t like mine back on Sunday.

---

I'm super confused right now!

Did he say that in relation to our situation because he’s serious? Did he just say it in general? Or was he only saying it to make me fall in love with him for his own ego, knowing that I'm not really taking him seriously?

Did we stop going on dates because I didn’t contact him for one and a half to two weeks, and he thought that by just liking my stories, he was doing enough? Did he expect me to initiate, or was he simply telling me how he approaches dating in general, with nothing specific to do with me?

Are we  the guy and girl where things aren’t working out because I’m not taking him seriously, while he might want something more than just trying to seduce me? 

From my perspective, if he were really interested, he would have sent me a text after the date, saying he wanted to see me again—especially after we got intimate. He has a rare perspective on intimacy and dating.

Or is he just one of those guys who collects girls interested in dating him to feed his ego? Does he not care if I text him or not because he already has enough girls chasing him?

Am I misjudging him, or am I right to think he’s just a player? Or are we just losing a potential connection while we’re both getting to know other people, never really getting to know each other because I didn’t believe him?

 He knows I’m cautious, and if he really wanted to get to know me, I’d think he’d take that into account—he’s a 31-year-old man, after all.

What should I do now? Should I try to get to know him better or not? Should I keep it casual ? Should I take the risk of asking him directly, even if it might ruin everything? I keep thinking he’s just manipulating me into falling for him, but could it be just a coincidence and not directed at me at all?

I feel so confused and overwhelmed. I’m scared of getting carried away if I keep seeing him and hearing everything he says. I’m worried I’ll get my heart broken if I let myself trust him and try. But there are just so many red flags. I feel like my thoughts are all over the place, but I tried to express them as best as I could.

I’d really love to hear your opinion. Do you have any advice? 
No one in my life seems able to give me clear guidance, and we’re all confused about this.
My cousin thinks the “dream” thing was just an excuse to message me, something my cousin has heard about before.

Writing this I feel stupid. Knowing he’s probably just a player and I should not settle for someone who behaves like this. 

Thanks so much for taking the time to read this.
I know it’s kind of a long story. 

I wish you all the best.

Hi everyone,

I’ve been struggling a lot with eating lately. It feels like every time I try to eat, there’s this discomfort—like food just won’t go down, no matter how hard I try. Just walking into the dining hall and seeing the food makes me want to cry. Most days, I’m barely managing one full meal. I try to make up for it with things like milk, coffee, and yogurt, but I know that’s not enough. Sometimes, I can eat an orange or a cucumber, but even then, a lot of it ends up in the trash, and I wonder why I even bothered getting it.

At the same time, I’m really determined to lose weight and get fit. I’m thinking of joining my university’s Frisbee team (I already play a bit with my college group), but the path to real fitness feels painfully long. There’s this weird mix of pain and satisfaction in all of this—part of me knows my current approach isn’t healthy, but there’s something about not eating and still chasing a Frisbee up a hill that feels exhilarating. I’ve noticed moments when I’ll squat to pick up the Frisbee, and my vision goes black, but somehow, I keep going.

I guess I’m wondering if this sounds like disordered eating, but I’ve been to my GP and he just commented: “It’s unhealthy to not eat for three days.” 
If anyone has advice on how to find a healthier balance? It feels strange to talk about it, but I know I need to figure this out.

Thank you to anyone who reads this or has any advice.",1,1730752935.0,EatingDisorders,0,1.0,False

My dad just let it happen and tries to get food the same day.

I recently was visiting my parents to get some documents from them, and I was wanting some biscuits with my coffee my dad made and saw she had a new looking box of biscuits. I opened them up and they seemed normal, until I took a bite and it was the most rancid thing I tasted. It was like spoiled cardboard that's just bitter, I spit it out immediately and washed my mouth out. I was wondering if it was a bad batch, so I checked the box and they have a BEST BY DATE FROM 2019! She was asking me what's wrong with the biscuits and they should be good still since they weren't opened all this time. I yelled at her to throw out things when they expire and eat a biscuit to know why! She just said I'm sorry I assumed they're good. Every time I visit, I throw old food away that she won't notice and avoid eating her meals unless I see that they're new groceries and cooking it same day. 

How can I make my mom understand she has a problem and she needs to throw old food away? She gave my fiancé parmesean cheese that expired in 2021, that's how bad things are. She always complains about GI issues and I think it's from eating old expired food she hoards and believes will never go bad in the fridge or freezer. I have many more examples of how she fed my siblings and I old foods until we find the packages expiration dates, tastes rancid, or found out she just removed the mold. She needs to break this habit of buying too much food and letting spoiled food sit in her pantry for years and think it's ok to eat. My fiancé doesn't trust her food at all and tries to bring our own food when we come to visit or make sure she bought it the same day.

Note: my parents have the means to buy weekly groceries, she just buys insane amount of food and forgets about them but doesn't want to throw it away since she might need it soon.",5,1730752339.0,AITAH,10,0.86,False

Oddly, I woke up at 3 a.m., checked the time, and fell back asleep. I debated staying up to get a head start on the day—one side of my mind whispering for rest, the other nudging me to seize the early hours. This time, rest, cozy and reassuring, won out.

By 4:30 a.m., I changed my alarm from 4:45 to 5:10 and squeezed in more sleep. 😊 Finally, I got up, pushed myself through my morning routine, and was out the door by 6 a.m.

The walk to the train station was peaceful, with the soft morning light casting a gentle glow on people hurrying to their destinations. Watching them, each with their own stories and dreams, felt quietly inspiring. Observing the rush and different walks of life was inspiring in its own way. I’ve been trying to build a habit of not checking my phone immediately after waking up. Instead, I promised myself to only check messages once on the train (more on conscious vs. autopilot thinking in another post!).

Arriving in Philly at 6:30 a.m., the cool morning air and tall buildings greeted me with a sense of calm. The city had its own pulse, a mix of serenity and silent anticipation that made the walk to work feel special. As usual, I stopped by Starbucks for my regular coffee before heading to work.

I (22m) and my partner (21f) have a 7 month old son and another on the way due in may. Being young parents obviously has many challenges but the one we have found affects us most in our day to day lives is this overwhelming feeling of loneliness.

When we started dating she lived about an hour away from me and I would drive to see her after work everyday and stay at her place when I had days off. We were both pretty social in our own circles and would usually be out with our respective friends on the weekends.

I moved to her town and we got a place in December of last year because most of her support network is her large family (we love them). Since moving I’ve lost contact with almost all of my friends and even those who I do still talk to just don’t want to make the hour and a half drive (I don’t blame them, it sucked). 

Since becoming a mother, the friends my partner had seem to just assume she doesn’t want to go out with them or can’t because she has a baby. They are also just in a much different stage of their lives than we are and it tends to make being around them hard.

It just feels like becoming parents so young has isolated us and neither of us have any idea how to find people our age or older that want to just go get coffee a few times a week or come over for dinner.

Ask me anything! I learned a LOT from this experience. 
I finished in 5:26 and I’m 29M. 5’10 and 175lbs. 

Let’s get into the breakdown with all relevant data I can think of right now. 

Training: 5 months running, started June 2024 this year. Never played sports in school, did martial arts for a few years on and off. 
Built up to 20 miles a week on my own. Followed 10 weeks of a 12 wk plan with Runna. Averaged 30 mi/week on plan. Missed 1.5 weeks entirely with Achilles tendinitis, greatly reduced mileage final 3 weeks before race (10-15 mi/week) 
Missed the 18 & 21 mi long runs. 
Farthest I ever ran was 14 miles.

Race day! 
I woke up at 3:10AM and was only able to sleep a total of 3.5 hours including the bonus hour from daylight savings. Believe me I tried to sleep at 7:00pm but was so antsy I couldn’t until around 12:30am. 

The weather at the start was 45F and very windy (felt colder). During my race temps gradually increased to around 60 with clouds and wind still present heavily. 

What I ate pre race: 
2x BPN go bars (1 2 hours pre race, 1 hour pre race (no time for planned breakfast…) and 2 scoops G1M sport. 1 cold brew coffee. 

Ate during race. Every 25-30 min 
5x BPN go Gels 
2x maurten 160 solid bars 
2x maurten caffeine gels 
1x gu gel at mile 22 as I ran out of my own. 

What I drank: 
1x Water cup at every aid station (2-3 miles)
3x scoops G1M sport (1 in bottle on hand, 2 more water bottles with a scoop given to me by family at miles 18, 21.  

Gear: 
Shoes. Hoka Cielo X1 with custom insoles from roadrunner sports. EXCELLENT CHOICE. 

Clothes: Janji trail half tight, Nike run shirt, Injinji toe socks, ciele run hat, random sunglasses 

Other gear: amp handheld bottle with pouch for some of the gels and solids. 
Body glide! Used on feet, toes, thighs, nipples (yes). Got 1 small blister on my right pinky toe and that was it for chafing and blisters. 
Squirrels nut butter used on groin and ass (yes). 

Used Rock tape to support my left Achilles that had been problematic in training. This was HUGE. Zero Achilles pain despite feeling it 3 weeks prior after only 9 miles. 

Difficulties: hip flexor pain at mile 19. Run/walked (50/50 or so) from mile 19.5 to finish. After mile 20 was a grind. Was in pain but had gas to sprint finish the last 0.2 miles. 
No cramping at all pre or post race! 

Final thoughts on the race:
I wasted about 25 minutes with 2 slowish porta potty lines mid race to pee and 1 porta potty #2 stop. Goal was simply to finish as best I could. 

I’m very happy! I am pretty confident I can run a sub 4:30 next year with better training, adding proper strength training, no #2 stop if possible and no injuries during the block. 
First half of the race I was running around a 10:30/mile pace and felt strong. 

I learned a lot, I’m sure more than I wrote here. ",6,1730751767.0,firstmarathon,0,0.81,False

","Few weeks ago I saw this woman I went to high school with. Both in our mid 20s. Never had spoke to her at all but we had a class together. Always thought she was cute then. 

And well I was in line at the coffee shop, and she enters and gets behind me and says hello a friendly manner. 

I kind of ignored it for whatever reason. Maybe I thought it just like a nervous kind of hello where you awkwardly say something while waiting in line. Or maybe just me being distracted as I am with my ADHD mind. 

After a while of waiting though I get the courage to say something. 

“Hey did you go to so and so school” 

“Yes… oh my god how do you know”

“I recognize you I also went, I’m sure we had a class together”

“Really? What class were you?” 

“2015 but should’ve been 16, graduated early tho” 

And ya da ya da ya da. Made small talk, and excused myself when it was my turn. 

I go to waiting area and eventually she does too. She continues the conversation, we introduce our names and I shake her hand when doing so, and we talk about what we’ve been up to in ours 20s and such. 

I wanted to drink coffee with her so I ask her if she took hers to go. And she “yeah I did”. And well I didn’t want to bother her so I said “ah okay, well then I guess let me sit down and enjoy my coffee. It was nice meeting you, officially at least haha, and well you have a good day Chloe” and go for another handshake, to which she stands and says “aww come on let’s just for a hug instead” or “awww come on just give me a hug instead”.

I sat outside and enjoyed my coffee and when she went out with her she’s was like “bye! You have a good day take care” and I say the same.

Few weeks later it’s got me thinking whether or not I should’ve gone for it. Can hugs be platonic when it comes to stranger or could it possibly be flirting?",3,1730751760.0,bodylanguage,4,0.72,False

1gjo5jk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1gjo5jk/theory_an_alternative_mental_health_treatment/,Theory - An Alternative Mental Health Treatment Facility - Inpatient/Outpatient,"So I have watched S1 twice through already and I'm on my third rewatch. This theory first dawned on me when they go into the smile room with the mouths on the wall and they're talking about all the people they have helped... and it occurred to me that Mark S. is there for exactly that reason. To get help. The entire first episode is about that. We established that his wife died in a car accident and his outie drinks heavily, was he drunk driving? Did he kill her? Was he court-ordered into some sort of program? The same goes for the other MDR members as well. What do we know about Dylan and Irv? They could all be verifiably insane on the outside for all we know. It's obvious that they are lab rats, being studied, with the ""maze"" and everything else.

I believe that this is also why everyone treats Kier like a God, a Freud type that everyone believes will save the world. ""Kier saw us all working together."" It's a common idea in prison and mental health facility reform to not treat the prisoners/patients as crazy or as prisoners in an attempt to heal them. There are many ideas for prison reform that include treating them with more dignity, white-collar, data refinement-type jobs, etc. Also when Helly R. wakes up she is literally in a padded room. The chairs are padded, etc. This theory could help explain all the other theories as well about the soap and the food/coffee being medicated. I also believe this is why there are 4 members in the MDR room--they represent the 4 tempers. And I think there's something about that theory that Kier has found to heal the person--to treat the whole person. Just a thought. There are still several unknowns but what I am fairly confident in at this point is that it's an experiment on these individuals to test it as an alternative option to psychiatric care or even court-ordered inpatient care, maybe even an alternative prison. The exciting part from a writing standpoint is that the outies could have very interesting backstories.

In the first episode where Mark tells his sister that he saw a man in the yard she laughs him off but agrees with him, exactly how you would treat a schizophrenic or crazy person. And when he brings it up again there's a similar response. He also lives in Lumon housing and is essentially being monitored at all times. Mrs. Cobel could be a psychiatrist whose job is to heal/treat them. Which explains why she's so religious in her following of Kier's teachings. She's running experiments on Mark with Casey. Or what we think is Gemma. Which the whole Casey thing still leaves a question mark in this theory, although she could be a robot version made to look like his ex to see if he remembers. There's the scene where Mark and Helly run into Miss Casey in the hallway and he apologizes and Casey says ""It's ok I forgive you."" and there's this brief micro-expression on Mark's face and it's quite nice. I mean we know that there's an art department, what if the art department is making lifelike robots to help rehabilitate the patients?

I feel like this can go deep. Please help me with other instances that could apply here or if there's something I'm missing. I'm doing the entire third rewatch with this in mind. I'm being hyper-critical of the theory and looking for anything that could disprove this theory. Help me out.",1,1730751638.0,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,2,1.0,False
1gjo5ic,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1gjo5ic/the_last_cup_of_tea/,The Last Cup of Tea,"The first time he walked into my tea house, butterflies were dancing outside the window. Two Monarchs, their wings catching light like stained glass, performing an aerial ballet through the golden autumn air. The old copper wind chimes my grandmother hung years ago tinkled softly, their green patina matching the tiny moss garden by the entrance.

I was grinding matcha when he entered, the stone mortar warming under my hands. The rhythmic scraping stopped as our eyes met. He looked like drowning felt - beautiful but desperate for air. His navy blue hospital scrubs were wrinkled, and there was a coffee stain on his sleeve that he'd tried to wash out but couldn't quite manage.

""What would you recommend?"" he asked, and I noticed how his fingers drummed against his thigh - an anxious morse code I'd learn to read over time. The dark circles under his eyes reminded me of tea stains at the bottom of cups.

""You need White Peony,"" I said, already reaching for my grandmother's clay pot - the one with the butterfly etched into its side, wings spread in eternal flight. ""It's like morning dew on spider webs. Gentle but strong enough to hold your world together.""

He raised an eyebrow, amused. ""That's... poetic.""

""Tea is poetry you can drink,"" I replied, watching his expression soften as the steam rose between us. ""I'm Maya.""

""Daniel,"" he said, and somehow I knew that name would change everything.

Our love story unfolded like a tea leaf in hot water - slowly, deliberately, releasing its essence in its own time. Every Thursday afternoon, he'd appear, shedding the weight of hospital shifts like a heavy coat at my door. I learned to read his mood by his footsteps on the wooden floors - light and quick on good days, heavy and dragging when he'd lost a patient.

My tea house became his sanctuary. I taught him about gongfu cha, how to listen to the water's song as it heated, how to hold a cup like you're cradling a bird. He taught me about the stars, sneaking me up to the hospital roof where we'd drink jasmine tea from a thermos and trace constellations with our fingers.

""That's Orion's Belt,"" he'd whisper, his breath warm against my ear. ""Three stars to guide lost people home."" His hand would find mine in the dark, and I'd pretend not to notice how it trembled.

The butterflies stayed all winter, defying nature itself. They'd dance outside my shop window every day, their wings now tattered but still beautiful. My grandmother would have said it was a sign. She taught me to read tea leaves, to sense the stories hiding in the dregs at the bottom of cups. But she never taught me how to read the darkness in someone's eyes, or how to heal a heart that's breaking in slow motion.

I started noticing changes. How he switched from oolong to stronger black teas. How his hospital stories became shorter, darker. How he'd stare at the butterflies like they held answers to questions he couldn't voice.

The last time he came in, it was raining. The butterflies were nowhere to be seen. He ordered Dragon Well - his favorite now - but the tea grew cold between his hands. A single leaf floated vertically in his cup - an omen my grandmother would have recognized. When he left, he touched the butterfly etching on the teapot, his fingers lingering like a goodbye.

His text came at 2 AM:

""The tea you made today... it tasted like goodbye. You always knew, didn't you? What we needed before we did. I'm sorry, Maya. The roof door is never locked. Weird for a hospital, right? Don't call anyone. I just... wanted to thank you. For showing me beauty can exist in small things. In tea leaves and butterfly wings and moments of peace between storms. Look up sometimes, okay? I'll be that weird star that doesn't fit in any constellation.""

I found him on the roof, sitting on the edge, a thermos of cold Dragon Well tea beside him. The same spot where we used to watch stars. The same spot where he first kissed me, tasting of jasmine and hope. This time, when I reached for him, he tasted of salt and goodbye.

He's getting help now. Real help. Sometimes he still comes in for tea, but we orbit each other like distant stars, close enough to see but too far to touch. Some bonds, once stretched too thin, become like over-steeped tea - too bitter to salvage.

But every morning, I still make an extra cup of Dragon Well. And every morning, two butterflies dance outside my window, their wings now iridescent in the dawn light. One has a torn wing but flies anyway, supported by its partner in their eternal dance.

Because sometimes love isn't about happy endings. Sometimes it's about being the person who notices - the trembling hands, the cooling tea, the cry for help buried in casual conversation about constellations. Sometimes love is simply being brave enough to keep pouring tea, keep watching for butterflies, keep believing in the power of small moments to save lives.

Even when those moments break your heart.

And sometimes, if you're very lucky, those broken pieces catch the light just right, like butterfly wings in autumn sun, reminding you that beauty can exist even in endings.

P.S. - I still keep his favorite clay pot, the one with the butterfly etching, ready each Thursday. Old habits die hard, like hope, like love, like butterflies that refuse to fly south for winter.",49,1730751636.0,shortscarystories,7,0.96,False

You know that … you know I don’t have anyone so you made yourself indispensable and you know that as long as I only have you , I can’t go anywhere . I blame you for every part of this life that is bad . I love our beautiful baby but I wish you were a better man . I wish you could tell me the truth instead of gaslighting me further . You know I can’t fucking go anywhere so you may as well tell me . You’re too much of a coward . I hate you I hate you I hate you . And I hate that you’re all I have . And that it’s better the devil you know than finding a new devil . I see right through you and you just aren’t a good person and I can’t believe I ever thought you were . I don’t have anyone to run to to save me . I don’t have a village . I don’t have a mommy and a step daddy who will lie for me . I wish I had left you when I was strong enough to leave you . Now , I’m so weak that I couldn’t if I tried . You know that and you love it . You probably did talk to Shannon , Shyann Sierra ,  Lauren … you probably did do me dirty with Jazmin and Kristine … you made my whole family think I was crazy when it was you driving me crazy . One day you’ll receive your karma … and I’ll be there . Until then , just keep going to work and coming home and leave me alone .  I don’t even want to talk to you anymore . Just so long as the family is taken care of . You disgust me and I can’t even believe I had sex with you yesterday . Maybe I was just feeling lonely. Three pumps and you’re done ? Maybe you aren’t cheating on me but you still disgust me ",3,1730751223.0,UnsentLettersRaw,1,1.0,False
1gjnxiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1gjnxiu/sudden_aversion_to_coffee_after_raising_vyvanse/,Sudden aversion to coffee after raising Vyvanse?,"I’ve drank coffee my whole life and love coffee, but my dr. recently raised my Vyvanse dose from 10 to 30. 

Once I was on the new dose for about a week, I simply didn’t feel interested (mind/body/stomach/taste) in coffee at all.

I thought maybe I made a bad batch, so I ordered coffee from a coffee shop I usually like. Same thing - not interested at all/just couldn’t drink it.

This has happened a few days in a row now.

Is this a known thing with upping Vyvanse? I’m just really surprised. 

I don’t have any other changes in food/drinks, just coffee. ",1,1730751089.0,adhdwomen,8,0.57,False

1gjnwjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dropshipping_Guide/comments/1gjnwjo/need_product_hunting_guidance/,Need Product Hunting Guidance ,"I am new to drop shipping. Me and my friend have been hunting for a good product for 2 months and still really didn't have any success uptil now about what niche should we choose and what product should we sell.

 We tried multiple ways of hunting a product from seeing hot products from Tiktok Shop to doing research on Google Keyword planner and finding products from there. We first tried to find product on Amazon and bought Helium 10 but it was not worth it as our budget was a bit low.

We came to a result of selling Coffee related products but are still stuck with what metrics should we use to determine that the product will be a good start.

 It would mean alot of you could guide me or show me a way that i could follow or recommend any mentor to follow. The information on the internet is too much overwhelming. Your help would mean alot. Thank you :)",1,1730751021.0,Dropshipping_Guide,0,0.99,False
