I've been a private investigator for fifteen years. Mostly routine stuff – insurance fraud, cheating spouses, corporate espionage. The cases that keep the lights on but don't keep you up at night. That changed when Margaret Thorne walked into my office three days after Christmas, clutching a crumpled Macy's shopping bag like it was the only thing keeping her tethered to reality.

My name is August Reed. I operate out of a small office in Providence, Rhode Island, and I'm about to tell you about the case that made me seriously consider burning my PI license and opening a coffee shop somewhere quiet. Somewhere far from the East Coast. Somewhere where children don't disappear.

Mrs. Thorne was a composed woman, early forties, with the kind of rigid posture that speaks of old money and private schools. But her hands shook as she placed two school photos on my desk. Kiernan and Brynn Thorne, identical twins, seven years old. Both had striking auburn hair and those peculiar pale green eyes you sometimes see in Irish families.

""They vanished at the Providence Place Mall,"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. ""December 22nd, between 2:17 and 2:24 PM. Seven minutes. I only looked away for seven minutes.""

I'd seen the news coverage, of course. Twin children disappearing during Christmas shopping – it was the kind of story that dominated local headlines. The police had conducted an extensive search, but so far had turned up nothing. Mall security footage showed the twins entering the toy store with their mother but never leaving. It was as if they'd simply evaporated.

""Mrs. Thorne,"" I began carefully, ""I understand the police are actively investigating-""

""They're looking in the wrong places,"" she cut me off. ""They're treating this like an isolated incident. It's not."" She reached into her bag and pulled out a manila folder, spreading its contents across my desk. Newspaper clippings, printouts from news websites, handwritten notes.

""1994, Twin boys, age 7, disappeared from a shopping center in Baltimore. 2001, Twin girls, age 7, vanished from a department store in Burlington, Vermont. 2008, Another set of twins, boys, age 7, last seen at a strip mall in Augusta, Maine."" Her finger stabbed at each article. ""2015, Twin girls-""

""All twins?"" I interrupted, leaning forward. ""All age seven?""

She nodded, her lips pressed into a thin line. ""Always during the Christmas shopping season. Always in the northeastern United States. Always seven-year-old twins. The police say I'm seeing patterns where there aren't any. That I'm a grieving mother grasping at straws.""

I studied the articles more closely. The similarities were unsettling. Each case remained unsolved. No bodies ever found, no ransom demands, no credible leads. Just children vanishing into thin air while their parents' backs were turned.

I took the case.

That was six months ago. Since then, I've driven thousands of miles, interviewed dozens of families, and filled three notebooks with observations and theories. I've also started sleeping with my lights on, double-checking my locks, and jumping at shadows. Because what I've found... what I'm still finding... it's worse than anything you can imagine.

The pattern goes back further than Mrs. Thorne knew. Much further. I've traced similar disappearances back to 1952, though the early cases are harder to verify. Always twins. Always seven years old. Always during the Christmas shopping season. But that's just the surface pattern, the obvious one. There are other connections, subtle details that make my skin crawl when I think about them too long.

In each case, security cameras malfunction at crucial moments. Not obviously – no sudden static or blank screens. The footage just becomes subtly corrupted, faces blurred just enough to be useless, timestamps skipping microseconds at critical moments. Every single time.

Then there are the witnesses. In each case, at least one person recalls seeing the children leaving the store or mall with ""their parent."" But the descriptions of this parent never match the actual parents, and yet they're also never quite consistent enough to build a reliable profile. ""Tall but not too tall."" ""Average looking, I think."" ""Wearing a dark coat... or maybe it was blue?"" It's like trying to describe someone you saw in a dream.

But the detail that keeps me up at night? In every single case, in the weeks leading up to the disappearance, someone reported seeing the twins playing with matchboxes. Not matchbox cars – actual matchboxes. Empty ones. Different witnesses, different locations, but always the same detail: children sliding empty matchboxes back and forth between them like some kind of game.

The Thorne twins were no exception. Their babysitter mentioned it to me in passing, something she'd noticed but hadn't thought important enough to tell the police. ""They'd sit for hours,"" she said, ""pushing these old matchboxes across the coffee table to each other. Never said a word while they did it. It was kind of creepy, actually. I threw the matchboxes away a few days before... before it happened.""

I've driven past the Providence Place Mall countless times since taking this case. Sometimes, late at night when the parking lot is almost empty, I park and watch the entrance where the Thorne twins were last seen. I've started noticing things. Small things. Like how the security cameras seem to turn slightly when no one's watching. Or how there's always at least one person walking through the lot who seems just a little too interested in the families going in and out.

Last week, I followed one of these observers. They led me on a winding route through Providence's east side, always staying just far enough ahead that I couldn't get a clear look at them. Finally, they turned down a dead-end alley. When I reached the alley, they were gone. But there, in the middle of the pavement, was a single empty matchbox.

I picked it up. Inside was a small piece of paper with an address in Portland, Maine. I've been sitting in my office for three days, staring at that matchbox, trying to decide what to do. The rational part of my brain says to turn everything over to the FBI. Let them connect the dots. Let them figure out why someone – or something – has been collecting seven-year-old twins for over seventy years.

But I know I won't. Because yesterday I received an email from a woman in Hartford. Her seven-year-old twins have started playing with matchboxes. Christmas is five months away.

I'm writing this down because I need someone to know what I've found, in case... in case something happens. I'm heading to Portland tomorrow. The address leads to an abandoned department store, according to Google Maps. I've arranged for this document to be automatically sent to several news outlets if I don't check in within 48 hours.

If you're reading this, it either means I'm dead, or I've found something so troubling that I've decided the world needs to know. Either way, if you have twins, or know someone who does, pay attention. Watch for the matchboxes. Don't let them play with matchboxes.

And whatever you do, don't let them out of your sight during Christmas shopping.

[Update - Day 1]

I'm in Portland now, parked across the street from the abandoned department store. It's one of those grand old buildings from the early 1900s, all ornate stonework and huge display windows, now covered with plywood. Holbrook & Sons, according to the faded lettering above the entrance. Something about it seems familiar, though I know I've never been here before.

The weird thing? When I looked up the building's history, I found that it closed in 1952 – the same year the twin disappearances started. The final day of business? December 24th.

I've been watching for three hours now. Twice, I've seen someone enter through a side door – different people each time, but they move the same way. Purposeful. Like they belong there. Like they're going to work.

My phone keeps glitching. The screen flickers whenever I try to take photos of the building. The last three shots came out completely black, even though it's broad daylight. The one before that... I had to delete it. It showed something standing in one of the windows. Something tall and thin that couldn't possibly have been there because all the windows are boarded up.

I found another matchbox on my hood when I came back from getting coffee. Inside was a key and another note: ""Loading dock. Midnight. Bring proof.""

Proof of what?

The sun is setting now. I've got six hours to decide if I'm really going to use that key. Six hours to decide if finding these children is worth risking becoming another disappearance statistic myself. Six hours to wonder what kind of proof they're expecting me to bring.

I keep thinking about something Mrs. Thorne said during one of our later conversations. She'd been looking through old family photos and noticed something odd. In pictures from the months before the twins disappeared, there were subtle changes in their appearance. Their eyes looked different – darker somehow, more hollow. And in the last photo, taken just two days before they vanished, they weren't looking at the camera. Both were staring at something off to the side, something outside the frame. And their expressions...

Mrs. Thorne couldn't finish describing those expressions. She just closed the photo album and asked me to leave.

I found the photo later, buried in the police evidence files. I wish I hadn't. I've seen a lot of frightened children in my line of work, but I've never seen children look afraid like that. It wasn't fear of something immediate, like a threat or a monster. It was the kind of fear that comes from knowing something. Something terrible. Something they couldn't tell anyone.

The same expression I've now found in photographs of other twins, taken days before they disappeared. Always the same hollow eyes. Always looking at something outside the frame.

I've got the key in my hand now. It's old, made of brass, heavy. The kind of key that opens serious locks. The kind of key that opens doors you maybe shouldn't open.

But those children... thirty-six sets of twins over seventy years. Seventy-two children who never got to grow up. Seventy-two families destroyed by Christmas shopping trips that ended in empty car seats and unopened presents.

The sun's almost gone now. The streetlights are coming on, but they seem dimmer than they should be. Or maybe that's just my imagination. Maybe everything about this case has been my imagination. Maybe I'll use that key at midnight and find nothing but an empty building full of dust and old memories.

But I don't think so.

Because I just looked at the last photo I managed to take before my phone started glitching. It's mostly black, but there's something in the darkness. A face. No – two faces. Pressed against one of those boarded-up windows.

They have pale green eyes.

[Update - Day 1, 11:45 PM]

I'm sitting in my car near the loading dock. Every instinct I have is screaming at me to drive away. Fast. But I can't. Not when I'm this close.

Something's happening at the building. Cars have been arriving for the past hour – expensive ones with tinted windows. They park in different locations around the block, never too close to each other. People get out – men and women in dark clothes – and disappear into various entrances. Like they're arriving for some kind of event.

The loading dock is around the back, accessed through an alley. No streetlights back there. Just darkness and the distant sound of the ocean. I've got my flashlight, my gun (for all the good it would do), and the key. And questions. So many questions.

Why here? Why twins? Why age seven? What's the significance of Christmas shopping? And why leave me a key?

The last question bothers me the most. They want me here. This isn't a break in the case – it's an invitation. But why?

11:55 PM now. Almost time. I'm going to leave my phone in the car, hidden, recording everything. If something happens to me, maybe it'll help explain...

Wait.

There's someone standing at the end of the alley. Just standing there. Watching my car. They're too far away to see clearly, but something about their proportions isn't quite right. Too tall. Too thin.

They're holding something. It looks like...

It looks like a matchbox.

Midnight. Time to go.


There was no key. No meeting. I couldn't bring myself to approach that loading dock.

Because at 11:57 PM, I saw something that made me realize I was never meant to enter that building. Not yet. Maybe not ever.

The figure at the end of the alley – the tall, thin one – started walking toward my car. Not the normal kind of walking. Each step was too long, too fluid, like someone had filmed a person walking and removed every other frame. As it got closer, I realized what had bothered me about its proportions. Its arms hung down past its knees. Way past its knees.

I sat there, paralyzed, as it approached my driver's side window. The streetlight behind it made it impossible to see its face, but I could smell something. Sweet, but wrong. Like fruit that's just started to rot.

It pressed something against my window. A matchbox. Inside the matchbox was a polaroid photograph.

I didn't call the police. I couldn't. Because the photo was of me, asleep in my bed, taken last night. In the background, standing in my bedroom doorway, were Kiernan and Brynn Thorne.

I drove. I don't remember deciding to drive, but I drove all night, taking random turns, going nowhere. Just trying to get away from that thing with the long arms, from that photograph, from the implications of what it meant.

The sun's coming up now. I'm parked at a rest stop somewhere in Massachusetts. I've been going through my notes, looking for something I missed. Some detail that might explain what's really happening.

I found something.

Remember those witness accounts I mentioned? The ones about seeing the twins leave with ""their parent""? I've been mapping them. Every single sighting, every location where someone reported seeing missing twins with an unidentifiable adult.

They form a pattern.

Plot them on a map and they make a shape. A perfect spiral, starting in Providence and growing outward across New England. Each incident exactly 27.3 miles from the last.

And if you follow the spiral inward, past Providence, to where it would logically begin?

That department store in Portland.

But here's what's really keeping me awake: if you follow the spiral outward, predicting where the next incident should be...

Hartford. Where those twins just started playing with matchboxes.

I need to make some calls. The families of the missing twins – not just the recent ones, but all of them. Every single case going back to 1952. Because I have a horrible suspicion...

[Update - Day 2, 5:22 PM]

I've spent all day on the phone. What I've found... I don't want it to be true.

Every family. Every single family of missing twins. Three months after their children disappeared, they received a matchbox in the mail. No return address. No note. Just an empty matchbox.

Except they weren't empty.

If you hold them up to the light just right, if you shake them in just the right way, you can hear something inside. Something that sounds like children whispering.

Mrs. Thorne should receive her matchbox in exactly one week.

I called her. Warned her not to open it when it arrives. She asked me why.

I couldn't tell her what the other parents told me. About what happened when they opened their matchboxes. About the dreams that started afterward. Dreams of their children playing in an endless department store, always just around the corner, always just out of sight. Dreams of long-armed figures arranging and rearranging toys on shelves that stretch up into darkness.

Dreams of their children trying to tell them something important. Something about the matchboxes. Something about why they had to play with them.

Something about what's coming to Hartford.

I think I finally understand why twins. Why seven-year-olds. Why Christmas shopping.

It's about innocence. About pairs. About symmetry.

And about breaking all three.

I've booked a hotel room in Hartford. I need to find those twins before they disappear. Before they become part of this pattern that's been spiraling outward for seventy years.

But first, I need to stop at my apartment. Get some clean clothes. Get my good camera. Get my case files.

I know that thing with the long arms might be waiting for me. I know the Thorne twins might be standing in my doorway again.

I'm going anyway.

Because I just realized something else about that spiral pattern. About the distance between incidents.

27.3 miles.

The exact distance light travels in the brief moment between identical twins being born.

The exact distance sound travels in the time it takes to strike a match.

[Update - Day 2, 8:45 PM]

I'm in my apartment. Everything looks normal. Nothing's been disturbed.

Except there's a toy department store catalog from 1952 on my kitchen table. I know it wasn't there this morning.

It's open to the Christmas section. Every child in every photo is a twin.

And they're all looking at something outside the frame.

All holding matchboxes.

All trying to warn us.


[Update - Day 2, 11:17 PM]

The catalog won't let me put it down.

I don't mean that metaphorically. Every time I try to set it aside, my fingers won't release it. Like it needs to be read. Like the pages need to be turned.

It's called ""Holbrook & Sons Christmas Catalog - 1952 Final Edition."" The cover shows the department store as it must have looked in its heyday: gleaming windows, bright lights, families streaming in and out. But something's wrong with the image. The longer I look at it, the more I notice that all the families entering the store have twins. All of them. And all the families leaving... they're missing their children.

The Christmas section starts on page 27. Every photo shows twin children modeling toys, clothes, or playing with holiday gifts. Their faces are blank, emotionless. And in every single photo, there's something in the background. A shadow. A suggestion of something tall and thin, just barely visible at the edge of the frame.

But it's the handwriting that's making my hands shake.

Someone has written notes in the margins. Different handwriting on each page. Different pens, different decades. Like people have been finding this catalog and adding to it for seventy years.

""They're trying to show us something."" (1963)
""The matchboxes are doors."" (1978)
""They only take twins because they need pairs. Everything has to have a pair."" (1991)
""Don't let them complete the spiral."" (2004)
""Hartford is the last point. After Hartford, the circle closes."" (2019)

The most recent note was written just weeks ago: ""When you see yourself in the mirror, look at your reflection's hands.""

I just tried it.

My reflection's hands were holding a matchbox.

I'm driving to Hartford now. I can't wait until morning. Those twins, the ones who just started playing with matchboxes – the Blackwood twins, Emma and Ethan – they live in the West End. Their mother posted about them on a local Facebook group, worried about their new ""obsession"" with matchboxes. Asking if any other parents had noticed similar behavior.

The catalog is on my passenger seat. It keeps falling open to page 52. There's a photo there that I've been avoiding looking at directly. It shows the toy department at Holbrook & Sons. Rows and rows of shelves stretching back into impossible darkness. And standing between those shelves...

I finally made myself look at it properly. Really look at it.

Those aren't mannequins arranging the toys.

[Update - Day 3, 1:33 AM]

I'm parked outside the Blackwood house. All the lights are off except one. Third floor, corner window. I can see shadows moving against the curtains. Small shadows. Child-sized shadows.

They're awake. Playing with matchboxes, probably.

I should go knock on the door. Wake the parents. Warn them.

But I can't stop staring at that window. Because every few minutes, there's another shadow. A much taller shadow. And its arms...

The catalog is open again. Page 73 now. It's an order form for something called a ""Twin's Special Holiday Package."" The description is blank except for one line:

""Every pair needs a keeper.""

The handwritten notes on this page are different. They're all the same message, written over and over in different hands:

""Don't let them take the children to the mirror department.""
""Don't let them take the children to the mirror department.""
""Don't let them take the children to the mirror department.""

The last one is written in fresh ink. Still wet.

My phone just buzzed. A text from an unknown number:
""Check the catalog index for 'Mirror Department - Special Services.'""

I know I shouldn't.

I'm going to anyway.

[Update - Day 3, 1:47 AM]

The index led me to page 127. The Mirror Department.

The photos on this page... they're not from 1952. They can't be. Because one of them shows the Thorne twins. Standing in front of a massive mirror in what looks like an old department store. But their reflection...

Their reflection shows them at different ages. Dozens of versions of them, stretching back into the mirror's depth. All holding matchboxes. All seven years old.

And behind each version, getting closer and closer to the foreground, one of those long-armed figures.

There's movement in the Blackwood house. Adult shapes passing by lit windows. The parents are awake.

But the children's shadows in the third-floor window aren't moving anymore. They're just standing there. Both holding something up to the window.

I don't need my binoculars to know what they're holding.

The catalog just fell open to the last page. There's only one sentence, printed in modern ink:

""The spiral ends where the mirrors begin.""

I can see someone walking up the street toward the house.

They're carrying a mirror.

[Update - Day 3, 2:15 AM]

I did something unforgivable. I let them take the Blackwood twins.

I sat in my car and watched as that thing with the long arms set up its mirror on their front lawn. Watched as the twins came downstairs and walked out their front door, matchboxes in hand. Watched as their parents slept through it all, unaware their children were walking into something ancient and hungry.

But I had to. Because I finally remembered what happened to my brother. What really happened that day at the mall.

And I understood why I became a private investigator.

The catalog is writing itself now. New pages appearing as I watch, filled with photos I took during this investigation. Only I never took these photos. In them, I'm the one being watched. In every crime scene photo, every surveillance shot, there's a reflection of me in a window or a puddle. And in each reflection, I'm standing next to a small boy. 

My twin brother. Still seven years old.

Still holding his matchbox.

[Update - Day 3, 3:33 AM]

I'm parked outside Holbrook & Sons again. The Blackwood twins are in there. I can feel them. Just like I can feel all the others. They're waiting.

The truth was in front of me the whole time. In every reflection, every window, every mirror I've passed in the fifteen years I've been investigating missing children.

We all have reflections. But reflections aren't supposed to remember. They're not supposed to want.

In 1952, something changed in the mirror department at Holbrook & Sons. Something went wrong with the symmetry of things. Reflections began to hunger. They needed pairs to be complete. Perfect pairs. Twins.

But only at age seven. Only when the original and the reflection are still similar enough to switch places.

The long-armed things? They're not kidnappers. They're what happens to reflections that stay in mirrors too long. That stretch themselves trying to reach through the glass. That hunger for the warmth of the real.

I know because I've been helping them. For fifteen years, I've been investigating missing twins, following the spiral pattern, documenting everything.

Only it wasn't me doing the investigating.

It was my reflection.

[Update - Day 3, 4:44 AM]

I'm at the loading dock now. The door is open. Inside, I can hear children playing. Laughing. The sound of matchboxes sliding across glass.

The catalog's final page shows a photo taken today. In it, I'm standing in front of a department store mirror. But my reflection isn't mimicking my movements. It's smiling. Standing next to it is my brother, still seven years old, still wearing the clothes he disappeared in.

He's holding out a matchbox to me.

And now I remember everything.

The day my brother disappeared, we weren't just shopping. We were playing a game with matchboxes. Sliding them back and forth to each other in front of the mirrors in the department store. Each time we slid them, our reflections moved a little differently. Became a little more real.

Until one of us stepped through the mirror.

But here's the thing about mirrors and twins.

When identical twins look at their reflection, how do they know which side of the mirror they're really on?

I've spent fifteen years investigating missing twins. Fifteen years trying to find my brother. Fifteen years helping gather more twins, more pairs, more reflections.

Because the thing in the mirror department at Holbrook & Sons? It's not collecting twins.

It's collecting originals.

Real children. Real warmth. Real life.

To feed all the reflections that have been trapped in mirrors since 1952. To give them what they've always wanted:

A chance to be real.

The door to the mirror department is open now. Inside, I can see them all. Every twin that's disappeared since 1952. All still seven years old. All still playing with their matchboxes.

All waiting to trade places. Just like my brother and I did.

Just like I've been helping other twins do for fifteen years.

Because I'm not August Reed, the private investigator who lost his twin brother in 1992.

I'm August Reed's reflection.

And now that the spiral is complete, now that we have enough pairs...

We can all step through.

All of us.

Every reflection. Every mirror image. Every shadow that's ever hungered to be real.

The matchbox in my hand is the same one my real self gave me in 1992.

Inside, I can hear my brother whispering:

""Your turn to be the reflection.""

[Final Update - Day 3, 5:55 AM]

Some things can only be broken by their exact opposites.

That's what my brother was trying to tell me through the matchbox all these years. Not ""your turn to be the reflection,"" but a warning: ""Don't let them take your turn at reflection.""

The matchboxes aren't tools for switching places. They're weapons. The only weapons that work against reflections. Because inside each one is a moment of perfect symmetry – the brief flare of a match creating identical light and shadow. The exact thing reflections can't replicate.

I know this because I'm not really August Reed's reflection.

I'm August Reed. The real one. The one who's spent fifteen years pretending to be fooled by his own reflection. Investigating disappearances while secretly learning the truth. Getting closer and closer to the center of the spiral.

My reflection thinks it's been manipulating me. Leading me here to complete some grand design. It doesn't understand that every investigation, every documented case, every mile driven was bringing me closer to the one thing it fears:

The moment when all the stolen children strike their matches at once.

[Update - Day 3, 6:27 AM]

I'm in the mirror department now. Every reflection of every twin since 1952 is here, thinking they've won. Thinking they're about to step through their mirrors and take our places.

Behind them, in the darkened store beyond the glass, I can see the real children. All still seven years old, because time moves differently in reflections. All holding their matchboxes. All waiting for the signal.

My reflection is smiling at me, standing next to what it thinks is my brother.

""The spiral is complete,"" it says. ""Time to make every reflection real.""

I smile back.

And I light my match.

The flash reflects off every mirror in the department. Multiplies. Amplifies. Every twin in every reflection strikes their match at the exact same moment. Light bouncing from mirror to mirror, creating a perfect spiral of synchronized flame.

But something goes wrong.

The light isn't perfect. The symmetry isn't complete. The spiral wavers.

I realize too late what's happened. Some of the children have been here too long. Spent too many years as reflections. The mirrors have claimed them so completely that they can't break free.

Including my brother.

[Final Entry - Day 3, Sunrise]

It's over, but victory tastes like ashes.

The mirrors are cracked, their surfaces no longer perfect enough to hold reflections that think and want and hunger. The long-armed things are gone. The spiral is broken.

But we couldn't save them all.

Most of the children were too far gone. Seven decades of living as reflections had made them more mirror than human. When the symmetry broke, they... faded. Became like old photographs, growing dimmer and dimmer until they were just shadows on broken glass.

Only the Thorne twins made it out. Only they were new enough, real enough, to survive the breaking of the mirrors. They're aging now, quickly but safely, their bodies catching up to the years they lost. Soon they'll be back with their mother, with only vague memories of a strange dream about matchboxes and mirrors.

The others... we had to let them go. My brother included. He looked at me one last time before he faded, and I saw peace in his eyes. He knew what his sacrifice meant. Knew that breaking the mirrors would save all the future twins who might have been taken.

The building will be demolished tomorrow. The mirrors will be destroyed properly, safely. The matchboxes will be burned.

But first, I have to tell sixty-nine families that their children aren't coming home. That their twins are neither dead nor alive, but something in between. Caught forever in that strange space between reality and reflection.

Sometimes, in department stores, I catch glimpses of them in the mirrors. Seven-year-olds playing with matchboxes, slowly fading like old polaroids. Still together. Still twins. Still perfect pairs, even if they're only pairs of shadows now.

This will be my last case as a private investigator. I've seen enough reflections for one lifetime.

But every Christmas shopping season, I stand guard at malls and department stores. Watching for long-armed figures. Looking for children playing with matchboxes.

Because the spiral may be broken, but mirrors have long memories.

And somewhere, in the spaces between reflection and reality, seventy years' worth of seven-year-old twins are still playing their matchbox games.

Still waiting.

Still watching.

Just to make sure it never happens again.

I've been a private investigator for fifteen years. Mostly routine stuff – insurance fraud, cheating spouses, corporate espionage. The cases that keep the lights on but don't keep you up at night.

Her finger stabbed at each article. ""2015, Twin girls-""

""All twins?"" I interrupted, leaning forward. ""All age seven?""

She nodded, her lips pressed into a thin line. ""Always during the Christmas shopping season. Always in the northeastern United States. Always seven-year-old twins. The police say I'm seeing patterns where there aren't any. That I'm a grieving mother grasping at straws.""

I studied the articles more closely. The similarities were unsettling. Each case remained unsolved. No bodies ever found, no ransom demands, no credible leads. Just children vanishing into thin air while their parents' backs were turned.

I took the case.

That was six months ago. Since then, I've driven thousands of miles, interviewed dozens of families, and filled three notebooks with observations and theories. I've also started sleeping with my lights on, double-checking my locks, and jumping at shadows. Because what I've found... what I'm still finding... it's worse than anything you can imagine.

The pattern goes back further than Mrs. Thorne knew. Much further. I've traced similar disappearances back to 1952, though the early cases are harder to verify. Always twins. Always seven years old. Always during the Christmas shopping season. But that's just the surface pattern, the obvious one. There are other connections, subtle details that make my skin crawl when I think about them too long.

In each case, security cameras malfunction at crucial moments. Not obviously – no sudden static or blank screens. The footage just becomes subtly corrupted, faces blurred just enough to be useless, timestamps skipping microseconds at critical moments. Every single time.

Then there are the witnesses. In each case, at least one person recalls seeing the children leaving the store or mall with ""their parent."" But the descriptions of this parent never match the actual parents, and yet they're also never quite consistent enough to build a reliable profile. ""Tall but not too tall."" ""Average looking, I think."" ""Wearing a dark coat... or maybe it was blue?"" It's like trying to describe someone you saw in a dream.

But the detail that keeps me up at night? In every single case, in the weeks leading up to the disappearance, someone reported seeing the twins playing with matchboxes. Not matchbox cars – actual matchboxes. Empty ones. Different witnesses, different locations, but always the same detail: children sliding empty matchboxes back and forth between them like some kind of game.

The Thorne twins were no exception. Their babysitter mentioned it to me in passing, something she'd noticed but hadn't thought important enough to tell the police. ""They'd sit for hours,"" she said, ""pushing these old matchboxes across the coffee table to each other. Never said a word while they did it. It was kind of creepy, actually. I threw the matchboxes away a few days before... before it happened.""

I've driven past the Providence Place Mall countless times since taking this case. Sometimes, late at night when the parking lot is almost empty, I park and watch the entrance where the Thorne twins were last seen. I've started noticing things. Small things. Like how the security cameras seem to turn slightly when no one's watching. Or how there's always at least one person walking through the lot who seems just a little too interested in the families going in and out.

Last week, I followed one of these observers. They led me on a winding route through Providence's east side, always staying just far enough ahead that I couldn't get a clear look at them. Finally, they turned down a dead-end alley. When I reached the alley, they were gone. But there, in the middle of the pavement, was a single empty matchbox.

I picked it up. Inside was a small piece of paper with an address in Portland, Maine. I've been sitting in my office for three days, staring at that matchbox, trying to decide what to do. The rational part of my brain says to turn everything over to the FBI. Let them connect the dots. Let them figure out why someone – or something – has been collecting seven-year-old twins for over seventy years.

But I know I won't. Because yesterday I received an email from a woman in Hartford. Her seven-year-old twins have started playing with matchboxes. Christmas is five months away.

I'm writing this down because I need someone to know what I've found, in case... in case something happens. I'm heading to Portland tomorrow. The address leads to an abandoned department store, according to Google Maps. I've arranged for this document to be automatically sent to several news outlets if I don't check in within 48 hours.

If you're reading this, it either means I'm dead, or I've found something so troubling that I've decided the world needs to know. Either way, if you have twins, or know someone who does, pay attention. Watch for the matchboxes. Don't let them play with matchboxes.

And whatever you do, don't let them out of your sight during Christmas shopping.

[Update - Day 1]

I'm in Portland now, parked across the street from the abandoned department store. It's one of those grand old buildings from the early 1900s, all ornate stonework and huge display windows, now covered with plywood. Holbrook & Sons, according to the faded lettering above the entrance. Something about it seems familiar, though I know I've never been here before.

The weird thing? When I looked up the building's history, I found that it closed in 1952 – the same year the twin disappearances started. The final day of business? December 24th.

I've been watching for three hours now. Twice, I've seen someone enter through a side door – different people each time, but they move the same way. Purposeful. Like they belong there. Like they're going to work.

My phone keeps glitching. The screen flickers whenever I try to take photos of the building. The last three shots came out completely black, even though it's broad daylight. The one before that... I had to delete it. It showed something standing in one of the windows. Something tall and thin that couldn't possibly have been there because all the windows are boarded up.

I found another matchbox on my hood when I came back from getting coffee. Inside was a key and another note: ""Loading dock. Midnight. Bring proof.""

Proof of what?

The sun is setting now. I've got six hours to decide if I'm really going to use that key. Six hours to decide if finding these children is worth risking becoming another disappearance statistic myself. Six hours to wonder what kind of proof they're expecting me to bring.

I keep thinking about something Mrs. Thorne said during one of our later conversations. She'd been looking through old family photos and noticed something odd. In pictures from the months before the twins disappeared, there were subtle changes in their appearance. Their eyes looked different – darker somehow, more hollow. And in the last photo, taken just two days before they vanished, they weren't looking at the camera. Both were staring at something off to the side, something outside the frame. And their expressions...

Mrs. Thorne couldn't finish describing those expressions. She just closed the photo album and asked me to leave.

I found the photo later, buried in the police evidence files. I wish I hadn't. I've seen a lot of frightened children in my line of work, but I've never seen children look afraid like that. It wasn't fear of something immediate, like a threat or a monster. It was the kind of fear that comes from knowing something. Something terrible. Something they couldn't tell anyone.

The same expression I've now found in photographs of other twins, taken days before they disappeared. Always the same hollow eyes. Always looking at something outside the frame.

I've got the key in my hand now. It's old, made of brass, heavy. The kind of key that opens serious locks. The kind of key that opens doors you maybe shouldn't open.

But those children... thirty-six sets of twins over seventy years. Seventy-two children who never got to grow up. Seventy-two families destroyed by Christmas shopping trips that ended in empty car seats and unopened presents.

The sun's almost gone now. The streetlights are coming on, but they seem dimmer than they should be. Or maybe that's just my imagination. Maybe everything about this case has been my imagination. Maybe I'll use that key at midnight and find nothing but an empty building full of dust and old memories.

But I don't think so.

Because I just looked at the last photo I managed to take before my phone started glitching. It's mostly black, but there's something in the darkness. A face. No – two faces. Pressed against one of those boarded-up windows.

They have pale green eyes.

[Update - Day 1, 11:45 PM]

I'm sitting in my car near the loading dock. Every instinct I have is screaming at me to drive away. Fast. But I can't. Not when I'm this close.

Something's happening at the building. Cars have been arriving for the past hour – expensive ones with tinted windows. They park in different locations around the block, never too close to each other. People get out – men and women in dark clothes – and disappear into various entrances. Like they're arriving for some kind of event.

The loading dock is around the back, accessed through an alley. No streetlights back there. Just darkness and the distant sound of the ocean. I've got my flashlight, my gun (for all the good it would do), and the key. And questions. So many questions.

Why here? Why twins? Why age seven? What's the significance of Christmas shopping? And why leave me a key?

The last question bothers me the most. They want me here. This isn't a break in the case – it's an invitation. But why?

11:55 PM now. Almost time. I'm going to leave my phone in the car, hidden, recording everything. If something happens to me, maybe it'll help explain...

Wait.

There's someone standing at the end of the alley. Just standing there. Watching my car. They're too far away to see clearly, but something about their proportions isn't quite right. Too tall. Too thin.

They're holding something. It looks like...

It looks like a matchbox.

Midnight. Time to go.


There was no key. No meeting. I couldn't bring myself to approach that loading dock.

Because at 11:57 PM, I saw something that made me realize I was never meant to enter that building. Not yet. Maybe not ever.

The figure at the end of the alley – the tall, thin one – started walking toward my car. Not the normal kind of walking. Each step was too long, too fluid, like someone had filmed a person walking and removed every other frame. As it got closer, I realized what had bothered me about its proportions. Its arms hung down past its knees. Way past its knees.

I sat there, paralyzed, as it approached my driver's side window. The streetlight behind it made it impossible to see its face, but I could smell something. Sweet, but wrong. Like fruit that's just started to rot.

It pressed something against my window. A matchbox. Inside the matchbox was a polaroid photograph.

I didn't call the police. I couldn't. Because the photo was of me, asleep in my bed, taken last night. In the background, standing in my bedroom doorway, were Kiernan and Brynn Thorne.

I drove. I don't remember deciding to drive, but I drove all night, taking random turns, going nowhere. Just trying to get away from that thing with the long arms, from that photograph, from the implications of what it meant.

The sun's coming up now. I'm parked at a rest stop somewhere in Massachusetts. I've been going through my notes, looking for something I missed. Some detail that might explain what's really happening.

I found something.

Remember those witness accounts I mentioned? The ones about seeing the twins leave with ""their parent""? I've been mapping them. Every single sighting, every location where someone reported seeing missing twins with an unidentifiable adult.

They form a pattern.

Plot them on a map and they make a shape. A perfect spiral, starting in Providence and growing outward across New England. Each incident exactly 27.3 miles from the last.

And if you follow the spiral inward, past Providence, to where it would logically begin?

That department store in Portland.

But here's what's really keeping me awake: if you follow the spiral outward, predicting where the next incident should be...

Hartford. Where those twins just started playing with matchboxes.

I need to make some calls. The families of the missing twins – not just the recent ones, but all of them. Every single case going back to 1952. Because I have a horrible suspicion...

[Update - Day 2, 5:22 PM]

I've spent all day on the phone. What I've found... I don't want it to be true.

Every family. Every single family of missing twins. Three months after their children disappeared, they received a matchbox in the mail. No return address. No note. Just an empty matchbox.

Except they weren't empty.

If you hold them up to the light just right, if you shake them in just the right way, you can hear something inside. Something that sounds like children whispering.

Mrs. Thorne should receive her matchbox in exactly one week.

I called her. Warned her not to open it when it arrives. She asked me why.

I couldn't tell her what the other parents told me. About what happened when they opened their matchboxes. About the dreams that started afterward. Dreams of their children playing in an endless department store, always just around the corner, always just out of sight. Dreams of long-armed figures arranging and rearranging toys on shelves that stretch up into darkness.

Dreams of their children trying to tell them something important. Something about the matchboxes. Something about why they had to play with them.

Something about what's coming to Hartford.

I think I finally understand why twins. Why seven-year-olds. Why Christmas shopping.

It's about innocence. About pairs. About symmetry.

And about breaking all three.

I've booked a hotel room in Hartford. I need to find those twins before they disappear. Before they become part of this pattern that's been spiraling outward for seventy years.

But first, I need to stop at my apartment. Get some clean clothes. Get my good camera. Get my case files.

I know that thing with the long arms might be waiting for me. I know the Thorne twins might be standing in my doorway again.

I'm going anyway.

Because I just realized something else about that spiral pattern. About the distance between incidents.

27.3 miles.

The exact distance light travels in the brief moment between identical twins being born.

The exact distance sound travels in the time it takes to strike a match.

[Update - Day 2, 8:45 PM]

I'm in my apartment. Everything looks normal. Nothing's been disturbed.

Except there's a toy department store catalog from 1952 on my kitchen table. I know it wasn't there this morning.

It's open to the Christmas section. Every child in every photo is a twin.

And they're all looking at something outside the frame.

All holding matchboxes.

All trying to warn us.


[Update - Day 2, 11:17 PM]

The catalog won't let me put it down.

I don't mean that metaphorically. Every time I try to set it aside, my fingers won't release it. Like it needs to be read. Like the pages need to be turned.

It's called ""Holbrook & Sons Christmas Catalog - 1952 Final Edition."" The cover shows the department store as it must have looked in its heyday: gleaming windows, bright lights, families streaming in and out. But something's wrong with the image. The longer I look at it, the more I notice that all the families entering the store have twins. All of them. And all the families leaving... they're missing their children.

The Christmas section starts on page 27. Every photo shows twin children modeling toys, clothes, or playing with holiday gifts. Their faces are blank, emotionless. And in every single photo, there's something in the background. A shadow. A suggestion of something tall and thin, just barely visible at the edge of the frame.

But it's the handwriting that's making my hands shake.

Someone has written notes in the margins. Different handwriting on each page. Different pens, different decades. Like people have been finding this catalog and adding to it for seventy years.

""They're trying to show us something."" (1963)
""The matchboxes are doors."" (1978)
""They only take twins because they need pairs. Everything has to have a pair."" (1991)
""Don't let them complete the spiral."" (2004)
""Hartford is the last point. After Hartford, the circle closes."" (2019)

The most recent note was written just weeks ago: ""When you see yourself in the mirror, look at your reflection's hands.""

I just tried it.

My reflection's hands were holding a matchbox.

I'm driving to Hartford now. I can't wait until morning. Those twins, the ones who just started playing with matchboxes – the Blackwood twins, Emma and Ethan – they live in the West End. Their mother posted about them on a local Facebook group, worried about their new ""obsession"" with matchboxes. Asking if any other parents had noticed similar behavior.

The catalog is on my passenger seat. It keeps falling open to page 52. There's a photo there that I've been avoiding looking at directly. It shows the toy department at Holbrook & Sons. Rows and rows of shelves stretching back into impossible darkness. And standing between those shelves...

I finally made myself look at it properly. Really look at it.

Those aren't mannequins arranging the toys.

[Update - Day 3, 1:33 AM]

I'm parked outside the Blackwood house. All the lights are off except one. Third floor, corner window. I can see shadows moving against the curtains. Small shadows. Child-sized shadows.

They're awake. Playing with matchboxes, probably.

I should go knock on the door. Wake the parents. Warn them.

But I can't stop staring at that window. Because every few minutes, there's another shadow. A much taller shadow. And its arms...

The catalog is open again. Page 73 now. It's an order form for something called a ""Twin's Special Holiday Package."" The description is blank except for one line:

""Every pair needs a keeper.""

The handwritten notes on this page are different. They're all the same message, written over and over in different hands:

""Don't let them take the children to the mirror department.""
""Don't let them take the children to the mirror department.""
""Don't let them take the children to the mirror department.""

The last one is written in fresh ink. Still wet.

My phone just buzzed. A text from an unknown number:
""Check the catalog index for 'Mirror Department - Special Services.'""

I know I shouldn't.

I'm going to anyway.

[Update - Day 3, 1:47 AM]

The index led me to page 127. The Mirror Department.

The photos on this page... they're not from 1952. They can't be. Because one of them shows the Thorne twins. Standing in front of a massive mirror in what looks like an old department store. But their reflection...

Their reflection shows them at different ages. Dozens of versions of them, stretching back into the mirror's depth. All holding matchboxes. All seven years old.

And behind each version, getting closer and closer to the foreground, one of those long-armed figures.

There's movement in the Blackwood house. Adult shapes passing by lit windows. The parents are awake.

But the children's shadows in the third-floor window aren't moving anymore. They're just standing there. Both holding something up to the window.

I don't need my binoculars to know what they're holding.

The catalog just fell open to the last page. There's only one sentence, printed in modern ink:

""The spiral ends where the mirrors begin.""

I can see someone walking up the street toward the house.

They're carrying a mirror.

[Update - Day 3, 2:15 AM]

I did something unforgivable. I let them take the Blackwood twins.

I sat in my car and watched as that thing with the long arms set up its mirror on their front lawn. Watched as the twins came downstairs and walked out their front door, matchboxes in hand. Watched as their parents slept through it all, unaware their children were walking into something ancient and hungry.

But I had to. Because I finally remembered what happened to my brother. What really happened that day at the mall.

And I understood why I became a private investigator.

The catalog is writing itself now. New pages appearing as I watch, filled with photos I took during this investigation. Only I never took these photos. In them, I'm the one being watched. In every crime scene photo, every surveillance shot, there's a reflection of me in a window or a puddle. And in each reflection, I'm standing next to a small boy. 

My twin brother. Still seven years old.

Still holding his matchbox.

[Update - Day 3, 3:33 AM]

I'm parked outside Holbrook & Sons again. The Blackwood twins are in there. I can feel them. Just like I can feel all the others. They're waiting.

The truth was in front of me the whole time. In every reflection, every window, every mirror I've passed in the fifteen years I've been investigating missing children.

We all have reflections. But reflections aren't supposed to remember. They're not supposed to want.

In 1952, something changed in the mirror department at Holbrook & Sons. Something went wrong with the symmetry of things. Reflections began to hunger. They needed pairs to be complete. Perfect pairs. Twins.

But only at age seven. Only when the original and the reflection are still similar enough to switch places.

The long-armed things? They're not kidnappers. They're what happens to reflections that stay in mirrors too long. That stretch themselves trying to reach through the glass. That hunger for the warmth of the real.

I know because I've been helping them. For fifteen years, I've been investigating missing twins, following the spiral pattern, documenting everything.

Only it wasn't me doing the investigating.

It was my reflection.

[Update - Day 3, 4:44 AM]

I'm at the loading dock now. The door is open. Inside, I can hear children playing. Laughing. The sound of matchboxes sliding across glass.

The catalog's final page shows a photo taken today. In it, I'm standing in front of a department store mirror. But my reflection isn't mimicking my movements. It's smiling. Standing next to it is my brother, still seven years old, still wearing the clothes he disappeared in.

He's holding out a matchbox to me.

And now I remember everything.

The day my brother disappeared, we weren't just shopping. We were playing a game with matchboxes. Sliding them back and forth to each other in front of the mirrors in the department store. Each time we slid them, our reflections moved a little differently. Became a little more real.

Until one of us stepped through the mirror.

But here's the thing about mirrors and twins.

When identical twins look at their reflection, how do they know which side of the mirror they're really on?

I've spent fifteen years investigating missing twins. Fifteen years trying to find my brother. Fifteen years helping gather more twins, more pairs, more reflections.

Because the thing in the mirror department at Holbrook & Sons? It's not collecting twins.

It's collecting originals.

Real children. Real warmth. Real life.

To feed all the reflections that have been trapped in mirrors since 1952. To give them what they've always wanted:

A chance to be real.

The door to the mirror department is open now. Inside, I can see them all. Every twin that's disappeared since 1952. All still seven years old. All still playing with their matchboxes.

All waiting to trade places. Just like my brother and I did.

Just like I've been helping other twins do for fifteen years.

Because I'm not August Reed, the private investigator who lost his twin brother in 1992.

I'm August Reed's reflection.

And now that the spiral is complete, now that we have enough pairs...

We can all step through.

All of us.

Every reflection. Every mirror image. Every shadow that's ever hungered to be real.

The matchbox in my hand is the same one my real self gave me in 1992.

Inside, I can hear my brother whispering:

""Your turn to be the reflection.""

[Final Update - Day 3, 5:55 AM]

Some things can only be broken by their exact opposites.

That's what my brother was trying to tell me through the matchbox all these years. Not ""your turn to be the reflection,"" but a warning: ""Don't let them take your turn at reflection.""

The matchboxes aren't tools for switching places. They're weapons. The only weapons that work against reflections. Because inside each one is a moment of perfect symmetry – the brief flare of a match creating identical light and shadow. The exact thing reflections can't replicate.

I know this because I'm not really August Reed's reflection.

I'm August Reed. The real one. The one who's spent fifteen years pretending to be fooled by his own reflection. Investigating disappearances while secretly learning the truth. Getting closer and closer to the center of the spiral.

My reflection thinks it's been manipulating me. Leading me here to complete some grand design. It doesn't understand that every investigation, every documented case, every mile driven was bringing me closer to the one thing it fears:

The moment when all the stolen children strike their matches at once.

[Update - Day 3, 6:27 AM]

I'm in the mirror department now. Every reflection of every twin since 1952 is here, thinking they've won. Thinking they're about to step through their mirrors and take our places.

Behind them, in the darkened store beyond the glass, I can see the real children. All still seven years old, because time moves differently in reflections. All holding their matchboxes. All waiting for the signal.

My reflection is smiling at me, standing next to what it thinks is my brother.

""The spiral is complete,"" it says. ""Time to make every reflection real.""

I smile back.

And I light my match.

The flash reflects off every mirror in the department. Multiplies. Amplifies. Every twin in every reflection strikes their match at the exact same moment. Light bouncing from mirror to mirror, creating a perfect spiral of synchronized flame.

But something goes wrong.

The light isn't perfect. The symmetry isn't complete. The spiral wavers.

I realize too late what's happened. Some of the children have been here too long. Spent too many years as reflections. The mirrors have claimed them so completely that they can't break free.

Including my brother.

[Final Entry - Day 3, Sunrise]

It's over, but victory tastes like ashes.

The mirrors are cracked, their surfaces no longer perfect enough to hold reflections that think and want and hunger. The long-armed things are gone. The spiral is broken.

But we couldn't save them all.

Most of the children were too far gone. Seven decades of living as reflections had made them more mirror than human. When the symmetry broke, they... faded. Became like old photographs, growing dimmer and dimmer until they were just shadows on broken glass.

Only the Thorne twins made it out. Only they were new enough, real enough, to survive the breaking of the mirrors. They're aging now, quickly but safely, their bodies catching up to the years they lost. Soon they'll be back with their mother, with only vague memories of a strange dream about matchboxes and mirrors.

The others... we had to let them go. My brother included. He looked at me one last time before he faded, and I saw peace in his eyes. He knew what his sacrifice meant. Knew that breaking the mirrors would save all the future twins who might have been taken.

The building will be demolished tomorrow. The mirrors will be destroyed properly, safely. The matchboxes will be burned.

But first, I have to tell sixty-nine families that their children aren't coming home. That their twins are neither dead nor alive, but something in between. Caught forever in that strange space between reality and reflection.

Sometimes, in department stores, I catch glimpses of them in the mirrors. Seven-year-olds playing with matchboxes, slowly fading like old polaroids. Still together. Still twins. Still perfect pairs, even if they're only pairs of shadows now.

This will be my last case as a private investigator. I've seen enough reflections for one lifetime.

But every Christmas shopping season, I stand guard at malls and department stores. Watching for long-armed figures. Looking for children playing with matchboxes.

Because the spiral may be broken, but mirrors have long memories.

And somewhere, in the spaces between reflection and reality, seventy years' worth of seven-year-old twins are still playing their matchbox games.

Still waiting.

Still watching.

Just to make sure it never happens again.

1hlnn86,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreadthenight/comments/1hlnn86/twins_continue_to_go_missing_during_the_christmas/,"Twins continue to go missing during the Christmas season, The truth is revealing itself","
I've been a private investigator for fifteen years. Mostly routine stuff – insurance fraud, cheating spouses, corporate espionage. The cases that keep the lights on but don't keep you up at night. That changed when Margaret Thorne walked into my office three days after Christmas, clutching a crumpled Macy's shopping bag like it was the only thing keeping her tethered to reality.

My name is August Reed. I operate out of a small office in Providence, Rhode Island, and I'm about to tell you about the case that made me seriously consider burning my PI license and opening a coffee shop somewhere quiet. Somewhere far from the East Coast. Somewhere where children don't disappear.

Mrs. Thorne was a composed woman, early forties, with the kind of rigid posture that speaks of old money and private schools. But her hands shook as she placed two school photos on my desk. Kiernan and Brynn Thorne, identical twins, seven years old. Both had striking auburn hair and those peculiar pale green eyes you sometimes see in Irish families.

""They vanished at the Providence Place Mall,"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. ""December 22nd, between 2:17 and 2:24 PM. Seven minutes. I only looked away for seven minutes.""

I'd seen the news coverage, of course. Twin children disappearing during Christmas shopping – it was the kind of story that dominated local headlines. The police had conducted an extensive search, but so far had turned up nothing. Mall security footage showed the twins entering the toy store with their mother but never leaving. It was as if they'd simply evaporated.

""Mrs. Thorne,"" I began carefully, ""I understand the police are actively investigating-""

""They're looking in the wrong places,"" she cut me off. ""They're treating this like an isolated incident. It's not."" She reached into her bag and pulled out a manila folder, spreading its contents across my desk. Newspaper clippings, printouts from news websites, handwritten notes.

""1994, Twin boys, age 7, disappeared from a shopping center in Baltimore. 2001, Twin girls, age 7, vanished from a department store in Burlington, Vermont. 2008, Another set of twins, boys, age 7, last seen at a strip mall in Augusta, Maine."" Her finger stabbed at each article. ""2015, Twin girls-""

""All twins?"" I interrupted, leaning forward. ""All age seven?""

She nodded, her lips pressed into a thin line. ""Always during the Christmas shopping season. Always in the northeastern United States. Always seven-year-old twins. The police say I'm seeing patterns where there aren't any. That I'm a grieving mother grasping at straws.""

I studied the articles more closely. The similarities were unsettling. Each case remained unsolved. No bodies ever found, no ransom demands, no credible leads. Just children vanishing into thin air while their parents' backs were turned.

I took the case.

That was six months ago. Since then, I've driven thousands of miles, interviewed dozens of families, and filled three notebooks with observations and theories. I've also started sleeping with my lights on, double-checking my locks, and jumping at shadows. Because what I've found... what I'm still finding... it's worse than anything you can imagine.

The pattern goes back further than Mrs. Thorne knew. Much further. I've traced similar disappearances back to 1952, though the early cases are harder to verify. Always twins. Always seven years old. Always during the Christmas shopping season. But that's just the surface pattern, the obvious one. There are other connections, subtle details that make my skin crawl when I think about them too long.

Then there are the witnesses. In each case, at least one person recalls seeing the children leaving the store or mall with ""their parent."" But the descriptions of this parent never match the actual parents, and yet they're also never quite consistent enough to build a reliable profile. ""Tall but not too tall."" ""Average looking, I think."" ""Wearing a dark coat... or maybe it was blue?"" It's like trying to describe someone you saw in a dream.

But the detail that keeps me up at night? In every single case, in the weeks leading up to the disappearance, someone reported seeing the twins playing with matchboxes. Not matchbox cars – actual matchboxes. Empty ones. Different witnesses, different locations, but always the same detail: children sliding empty matchboxes back and forth between them like some kind of game.

The Thorne twins were no exception. Their babysitter mentioned it to me in passing, something she'd noticed but hadn't thought important enough to tell the police. ""They'd sit for hours,"" she said, ""pushing these old matchboxes across the coffee table to each other. Never said a word while they did it. It was kind of creepy, actually. I threw the matchboxes away a few days before... before it happened.""

I've driven past the Providence Place Mall countless times since taking this case. Sometimes, late at night when the parking lot is almost empty, I park and watch the entrance where the Thorne twins were last seen. I've started noticing things. Small things. Like how the security cameras seem to turn slightly when no one's watching. Or how there's always at least one person walking through the lot who seems just a little too interested in the families going in and out.

Last week, I followed one of these observers. They led me on a winding route through Providence's east side, always staying just far enough ahead that I couldn't get a clear look at them. Finally, they turned down a dead-end alley. When I reached the alley, they were gone. But there, in the middle of the pavement, was a single empty matchbox.

I picked it up. Inside was a small piece of paper with an address in Portland, Maine. I've been sitting in my office for three days, staring at that matchbox, trying to decide what to do. The rational part of my brain says to turn everything over to the FBI. Let them connect the dots. Let them figure out why someone – or something – has been collecting seven-year-old twins for over seventy years.

But I know I won't. Because yesterday I received an email from a woman in Hartford. Her seven-year-old twins have started playing with matchboxes. Christmas is five months away.

I'm writing this down because I need someone to know what I've found, in case... in case something happens. I'm heading to Portland tomorrow. The address leads to an abandoned department store, according to Google Maps. I've arranged for this document to be automatically sent to several news outlets if I don't check in within 48 hours.

If you're reading this, it either means I'm dead, or I've found something so troubling that I've decided the world needs to know. Either way, if you have twins, or know someone who does, pay attention. Watch for the matchboxes. Don't let them play with matchboxes.

And whatever you do, don't let them out of your sight during Christmas shopping.

[Update - Day 1]

I'm in Portland now, parked across the street from the abandoned department store. It's one of those grand old buildings from the early 1900s, all ornate stonework and huge display windows, now covered with plywood. Holbrook & Sons, according to the faded lettering above the entrance. Something about it seems familiar, though I know I've never been here before.

The weird thing? When I looked up the building's history, I found that it closed in 1952 – the same year the twin disappearances started. The final day of business? December 24th.

I've been watching for three hours now. Twice, I've seen someone enter through a side door – different people each time, but they move the same way. Purposeful. Like they belong there. Like they're going to work.

My phone keeps glitching. The screen flickers whenever I try to take photos of the building. The last three shots came out completely black, even though it's broad daylight. The one before that... I had to delete it. It showed something standing in one of the windows. Something tall and thin that couldn't possibly have been there because all the windows are boarded up.

I found another matchbox on my hood when I came back from getting coffee. Inside was a key and another note: ""Loading dock. Midnight. Bring proof.""

Proof of what?

The sun is setting now. I've got six hours to decide if I'm really going to use that key. Six hours to decide if finding these children is worth risking becoming another disappearance statistic myself. Six hours to wonder what kind of proof they're expecting me to bring.

I keep thinking about something Mrs. Thorne said during one of our later conversations. She'd been looking through old family photos and noticed something odd. In pictures from the months before the twins disappeared, there were subtle changes in their appearance. Their eyes looked different – darker somehow, more hollow. And in the last photo, taken just two days before they vanished, they weren't looking at the camera. Both were staring at something off to the side, something outside the frame. And their expressions...

Mrs. Thorne couldn't finish describing those expressions. She just closed the photo album and asked me to leave.

I found the photo later, buried in the police evidence files. I wish I hadn't. I've seen a lot of frightened children in my line of work, but I've never seen children look afraid like that. It wasn't fear of something immediate, like a threat or a monster. It was the kind of fear that comes from knowing something. Something terrible. Something they couldn't tell anyone.

The same expression I've now found in photographs of other twins, taken days before they disappeared. Always the same hollow eyes. Always looking at something outside the frame.

I've got the key in my hand now. It's old, made of brass, heavy. The kind of key that opens serious locks. The kind of key that opens doors you maybe shouldn't open.

But those children... thirty-six sets of twins over seventy years. Seventy-two children who never got to grow up. Seventy-two families destroyed by Christmas shopping trips that ended in empty car seats and unopened presents.

The sun's almost gone now. The streetlights are coming on, but they seem dimmer than they should be. Or maybe that's just my imagination. Maybe everything about this case has been my imagination. Maybe I'll use that key at midnight and find nothing but an empty building full of dust and old memories.

But I don't think so.

Because I just looked at the last photo I managed to take before my phone started glitching. It's mostly black, but there's something in the darkness. A face. No – two faces. Pressed against one of those boarded-up windows.

They have pale green eyes.

[Update - Day 1, 11:45 PM]

I'm sitting in my car near the loading dock. Every instinct I have is screaming at me to drive away. Fast. But I can't. Not when I'm this close.

Something's happening at the building. Cars have been arriving for the past hour – expensive ones with tinted windows. They park in different locations around the block, never too close to each other. People get out – men and women in dark clothes – and disappear into various entrances. Like they're arriving for some kind of event.

The loading dock is around the back, accessed through an alley. No streetlights back there. Just darkness and the distant sound of the ocean. I've got my flashlight, my gun (for all the good it would do), and the key. And questions. So many questions.

Why here? Why twins? Why age seven? What's the significance of Christmas shopping? And why leave me a key?

The last question bothers me the most. They want me here. This isn't a break in the case – it's an invitation. But why?

11:55 PM now. Almost time. I'm going to leave my phone in the car, hidden, recording everything. If something happens to me, maybe it'll help explain...

Wait.

There's someone standing at the end of the alley. Just standing there. Watching my car. They're too far away to see clearly, but something about their proportions isn't quite right. Too tall. Too thin.

They're holding something. It looks like...

It looks like a matchbox.

Midnight. Time to go.


There was no key. No meeting. I couldn't bring myself to approach that loading dock.

Because at 11:57 PM, I saw something that made me realize I was never meant to enter that building. Not yet. Maybe not ever.

The figure at the end of the alley – the tall, thin one – started walking toward my car. Not the normal kind of walking. Each step was too long, too fluid, like someone had filmed a person walking and removed every other frame. As it got closer, I realized what had bothered me about its proportions. Its arms hung down past its knees. Way past its knees.

I sat there, paralyzed, as it approached my driver's side window. The streetlight behind it made it impossible to see its face, but I could smell something. Sweet, but wrong. Like fruit that's just started to rot.

It pressed something against my window. A matchbox. Inside the matchbox was a polaroid photograph.

I didn't call the police. I couldn't. Because the photo was of me, asleep in my bed, taken last night. In the background, standing in my bedroom doorway, were Kiernan and Brynn Thorne.

I drove. I don't remember deciding to drive, but I drove all night, taking random turns, going nowhere. Just trying to get away from that thing with the long arms, from that photograph, from the implications of what it meant.

The sun's coming up now. I'm parked at a rest stop somewhere in Massachusetts. I've been going through my notes, looking for something I missed. Some detail that might explain what's really happening.

I found something.

Remember those witness accounts I mentioned? The ones about seeing the twins leave with ""their parent""? I've been mapping them. Every single sighting, every location where someone reported seeing missing twins with an unidentifiable adult.

They form a pattern.

Plot them on a map and they make a shape. A perfect spiral, starting in Providence and growing outward across New England. Each incident exactly 27.3 miles from the last.

And if you follow the spiral inward, past Providence, to where it would logically begin?

That department store in Portland.

But here's what's really keeping me awake: if you follow the spiral outward, predicting where the next incident should be...

Hartford. Where those twins just started playing with matchboxes.

I need to make some calls. The families of the missing twins – not just the recent ones, but all of them. Every single case going back to 1952. Because I have a horrible suspicion...

[Update - Day 2, 5:22 PM]

I've spent all day on the phone. What I've found... I don't want it to be true.

Every family. Every single family of missing twins. Three months after their children disappeared, they received a matchbox in the mail. No return address. No note. Just an empty matchbox.

Except they weren't empty.

If you hold them up to the light just right, if you shake them in just the right way, you can hear something inside. Something that sounds like children whispering.

Mrs. Thorne should receive her matchbox in exactly one week.

I called her. Warned her not to open it when it arrives. She asked me why.

I couldn't tell her what the other parents told me. About what happened when they opened their matchboxes. About the dreams that started afterward. Dreams of their children playing in an endless department store, always just around the corner, always just out of sight. Dreams of long-armed figures arranging and rearranging toys on shelves that stretch up into darkness.

Dreams of their children trying to tell them something important. Something about the matchboxes. Something about why they had to play with them.

Something about what's coming to Hartford.

I think I finally understand why twins. Why seven-year-olds. Why Christmas shopping.

It's about innocence. About pairs. About symmetry.

And about breaking all three.

I've booked a hotel room in Hartford. I need to find those twins before they disappear. Before they become part of this pattern that's been spiraling outward for seventy years.

But first, I need to stop at my apartment. Get some clean clothes. Get my good camera. Get my case files.

I know that thing with the long arms might be waiting for me. I know the Thorne twins might be standing in my doorway again.

I'm going anyway.

Because I just realized something else about that spiral pattern. About the distance between incidents.

27.3 miles.

The exact distance light travels in the brief moment between identical twins being born.

The exact distance sound travels in the time it takes to strike a match.

[Update - Day 2, 8:45 PM]

I'm in my apartment. Everything looks normal. Nothing's been disturbed.

Except there's a toy department store catalog from 1952 on my kitchen table. I know it wasn't there this morning.

It's open to the Christmas section. Every child in every photo is a twin.

And they're all looking at something outside the frame.

All holding matchboxes.

All trying to warn us.


[Update - Day 2, 11:17 PM]

The catalog won't let me put it down.

I don't mean that metaphorically. Every time I try to set it aside, my fingers won't release it. Like it needs to be read. Like the pages need to be turned.

It's called ""Holbrook & Sons Christmas Catalog - 1952 Final Edition."" The cover shows the department store as it must have looked in its heyday: gleaming windows, bright lights, families streaming in and out. But something's wrong with the image. The longer I look at it, the more I notice that all the families entering the store have twins. All of them. And all the families leaving... they're missing their children.

The Christmas section starts on page 27. Every photo shows twin children modeling toys, clothes, or playing with holiday gifts. Their faces are blank, emotionless. And in every single photo, there's something in the background. A shadow. A suggestion of something tall and thin, just barely visible at the edge of the frame.

But it's the handwriting that's making my hands shake.

Someone has written notes in the margins. Different handwriting on each page. Different pens, different decades. Like people have been finding this catalog and adding to it for seventy years.

""They're trying to show us something."" (1963)
""The matchboxes are doors."" (1978)
""They only take twins because they need pairs. Everything has to have a pair."" (1991)
""Don't let them complete the spiral."" (2004)
""Hartford is the last point. After Hartford, the circle closes."" (2019)

The most recent note was written just weeks ago: ""When you see yourself in the mirror, look at your reflection's hands.""

I just tried it.

My reflection's hands were holding a matchbox.

I'm driving to Hartford now. I can't wait until morning. Those twins, the ones who just started playing with matchboxes – the Blackwood twins, Emma and Ethan – they live in the West End. Their mother posted about them on a local Facebook group, worried about their new ""obsession"" with matchboxes. Asking if any other parents had noticed similar behavior.

The catalog is on my passenger seat. It keeps falling open to page 52. There's a photo there that I've been avoiding looking at directly. It shows the toy department at Holbrook & Sons. Rows and rows of shelves stretching back into impossible darkness. And standing between those shelves...

I finally made myself look at it properly. Really look at it.

Those aren't mannequins arranging the toys.

[Update - Day 3, 1:33 AM]

I'm parked outside the Blackwood house. All the lights are off except one. Third floor, corner window. I can see shadows moving against the curtains. Small shadows. Child-sized shadows.

They're awake. Playing with matchboxes, probably.

I should go knock on the door. Wake the parents. Warn them.

But I can't stop staring at that window. Because every few minutes, there's another shadow. A much taller shadow. And its arms...

The catalog is open again. Page 73 now. It's an order form for something called a ""Twin's Special Holiday Package."" The description is blank except for one line:

""Every pair needs a keeper.""

The handwritten notes on this page are different. They're all the same message, written over and over in different hands:

""Don't let them take the children to the mirror department.""
""Don't let them take the children to the mirror department.""
""Don't let them take the children to the mirror department.""

The last one is written in fresh ink. Still wet.

My phone just buzzed. A text from an unknown number:
""Check the catalog index for 'Mirror Department - Special Services.'""

I know I shouldn't.

I'm going to anyway.

[Update - Day 3, 1:47 AM]

The index led me to page 127. The Mirror Department.

The photos on this page... they're not from 1952. They can't be. Because one of them shows the Thorne twins. Standing in front of a massive mirror in what looks like an old department store. But their reflection...

Their reflection shows them at different ages. Dozens of versions of them, stretching back into the mirror's depth. All holding matchboxes. All seven years old.

And behind each version, getting closer and closer to the foreground, one of those long-armed figures.

There's movement in the Blackwood house. Adult shapes passing by lit windows. The parents are awake.

But the children's shadows in the third-floor window aren't moving anymore. They're just standing there. Both holding something up to the window.

I don't need my binoculars to know what they're holding.

The catalog just fell open to the last page. There's only one sentence, printed in modern ink:

""The spiral ends where the mirrors begin.""

I can see someone walking up the street toward the house.

They're carrying a mirror.

[Update - Day 3, 2:15 AM]

I did something unforgivable. I let them take the Blackwood twins.

I sat in my car and watched as that thing with the long arms set up its mirror on their front lawn. Watched as the twins came downstairs and walked out their front door, matchboxes in hand. Watched as their parents slept through it all, unaware their children were walking into something ancient and hungry.

But I had to. Because I finally remembered what happened to my brother. What really happened that day at the mall.

And I understood why I became a private investigator.

The catalog is writing itself now. New pages appearing as I watch, filled with photos I took during this investigation. Only I never took these photos. In them, I'm the one being watched. In every crime scene photo, every surveillance shot, there's a reflection of me in a window or a puddle. And in each reflection, I'm standing next to a small boy. 

My twin brother. Still seven years old.

Still holding his matchbox.

[Update - Day 3, 3:33 AM]

I'm parked outside Holbrook & Sons again. The Blackwood twins are in there. I can feel them. Just like I can feel all the others. They're waiting.

The truth was in front of me the whole time. In every reflection, every window, every mirror I've passed in the fifteen years I've been investigating missing children.

We all have reflections. But reflections aren't supposed to remember. They're not supposed to want.

In 1952, something changed in the mirror department at Holbrook & Sons. Something went wrong with the symmetry of things. Reflections began to hunger. They needed pairs to be complete. Perfect pairs. Twins.

But only at age seven. Only when the original and the reflection are still similar enough to switch places.

The long-armed things? They're not kidnappers. They're what happens to reflections that stay in mirrors too long. That stretch themselves trying to reach through the glass. That hunger for the warmth of the real.

I know because I've been helping them. For fifteen years, I've been investigating missing twins, following the spiral pattern, documenting everything.

Only it wasn't me doing the investigating.

It was my reflection.

[Update - Day 3, 4:44 AM]

I'm at the loading dock now. The door is open. Inside, I can hear children playing. Laughing. The sound of matchboxes sliding across glass.

The catalog's final page shows a photo taken today. In it, I'm standing in front of a department store mirror. But my reflection isn't mimicking my movements. It's smiling. Standing next to it is my brother, still seven years old, still wearing the clothes he disappeared in.

He's holding out a matchbox to me.

And now I remember everything.

The day my brother disappeared, we weren't just shopping. We were playing a game with matchboxes. Sliding them back and forth to each other in front of the mirrors in the department store. Each time we slid them, our reflections moved a little differently. Became a little more real.

Until one of us stepped through the mirror.

But here's the thing about mirrors and twins.

When identical twins look at their reflection, how do they know which side of the mirror they're really on?

I've spent fifteen years investigating missing twins. Fifteen years trying to find my brother. Fifteen years helping gather more twins, more pairs, more reflections.

Because the thing in the mirror department at Holbrook & Sons? It's not collecting twins.

It's collecting originals.

Real children. Real warmth. Real life.

To feed all the reflections that have been trapped in mirrors since 1952. To give them what they've always wanted:

A chance to be real.

The door to the mirror department is open now. Inside, I can see them all. Every twin that's disappeared since 1952. All still seven years old. All still playing with their matchboxes.

All waiting to trade places. Just like my brother and I did.

Just like I've been helping other twins do for fifteen years.

Because I'm not August Reed, the private investigator who lost his twin brother in 1992.

I'm August Reed's reflection.

And now that the spiral is complete, now that we have enough pairs...

We can all step through.

All of us.

Every reflection. Every mirror image. Every shadow that's ever hungered to be real.

The matchbox in my hand is the same one my real self gave me in 1992.

Inside, I can hear my brother whispering:

""Your turn to be the reflection.""

[Final Update - Day 3, 5:55 AM]

Some things can only be broken by their exact opposites.

That's what my brother was trying to tell me through the matchbox all these years. Not ""your turn to be the reflection,"" but a warning: ""Don't let them take your turn at reflection.""

The matchboxes aren't tools for switching places. They're weapons. The only weapons that work against reflections. Because inside each one is a moment of perfect symmetry – the brief flare of a match creating identical light and shadow. The exact thing reflections can't replicate.

I know this because I'm not really August Reed's reflection.

I'm August Reed. The real one. The one who's spent fifteen years pretending to be fooled by his own reflection. Investigating disappearances while secretly learning the truth. Getting closer and closer to the center of the spiral.

My reflection thinks it's been manipulating me. Leading me here to complete some grand design. It doesn't understand that every investigation, every documented case, every mile driven was bringing me closer to the one thing it fears:

The moment when all the stolen children strike their matches at once.

[Update - Day 3, 6:27 AM]

I'm in the mirror department now. Every reflection of every twin since 1952 is here, thinking they've won. Thinking they're about to step through their mirrors and take our places.

Behind them, in the darkened store beyond the glass, I can see the real children. All still seven years old, because time moves differently in reflections. All holding their matchboxes. All waiting for the signal.

My reflection is smiling at me, standing next to what it thinks is my brother.

""The spiral is complete,"" it says. ""Time to make every reflection real.""

I smile back.

And I light my match.

The flash reflects off every mirror in the department. Multiplies. Amplifies. Every twin in every reflection strikes their match at the exact same moment. Light bouncing from mirror to mirror, creating a perfect spiral of synchronized flame.

But something goes wrong.

The light isn't perfect. The symmetry isn't complete. The spiral wavers.

I realize too late what's happened. Some of the children have been here too long. Spent too many years as reflections. The mirrors have claimed them so completely that they can't break free.

Including my brother.

[Final Entry - Day 3, Sunrise]

It's over, but victory tastes like ashes.

The mirrors are cracked, their surfaces no longer perfect enough to hold reflections that think and want and hunger. The long-armed things are gone. The spiral is broken.

But we couldn't save them all.

Most of the children were too far gone. Seven decades of living as reflections had made them more mirror than human. When the symmetry broke, they... faded. Became like old photographs, growing dimmer and dimmer until they were just shadows on broken glass.

Only the Thorne twins made it out. Only they were new enough, real enough, to survive the breaking of the mirrors. They're aging now, quickly but safely, their bodies catching up to the years they lost. Soon they'll be back with their mother, with only vague memories of a strange dream about matchboxes and mirrors.

The others... we had to let them go. My brother included. He looked at me one last time before he faded, and I saw peace in his eyes. He knew what his sacrifice meant. Knew that breaking the mirrors would save all the future twins who might have been taken.

The building will be demolished tomorrow. The mirrors will be destroyed properly, safely. The matchboxes will be burned.

But first, I have to tell sixty-nine families that their children aren't coming home. That their twins are neither dead nor alive, but something in between. Caught forever in that strange space between reality and reflection.

Sometimes, in department stores, I catch glimpses of them in the mirrors. Seven-year-olds playing with matchboxes, slowly fading like old polaroids. Still together. Still twins. Still perfect pairs, even if they're only pairs of shadows now.

This will be my last case as a private investigator. I've seen enough reflections for one lifetime.

But every Christmas shopping season, I stand guard at malls and department stores. Watching for long-armed figures. Looking for children playing with matchboxes.

Because the spiral may be broken, but mirrors have long memories.

And somewhere, in the spaces between reflection and reality, seventy years' worth of seven-year-old twins are still playing their matchbox games.

Still waiting.

Still watching.

Just to make sure it never happens again.

I've been a private investigator for fifteen years. Mostly routine stuff – insurance fraud, cheating spouses, corporate espionage. The cases that keep the lights on but don't keep you up at night. That changed when Margaret Thorne walked into my office three days after Christmas, clutching a crumpled Macy's shopping bag like it was the only thing keeping her tethered to reality.

My name is August Reed. I operate out of a small office in Providence, Rhode Island, and I'm about to tell you about the case that made me seriously consider burning my PI license and opening a coffee shop somewhere quiet. Somewhere far from the East Coast. Somewhere where children don't disappear.

Mrs. Thorne was a composed woman, early forties, with the kind of rigid posture that speaks of old money and private schools. But her hands shook as she placed two school photos on my desk. Kiernan and Brynn Thorne, identical twins, seven years old. Both had striking auburn hair and those peculiar pale green eyes you sometimes see in Irish families.

""They vanished at the Providence Place Mall,"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. ""December 22nd, between 2:17 and 2:24 PM. Seven minutes. I only looked away for seven minutes.""

I'd seen the news coverage, of course. Twin children disappearing during Christmas shopping – it was the kind of story that dominated local headlines. The police had conducted an extensive search, but so far had turned up nothing. Mall security footage showed the twins entering the toy store with their mother but never leaving. It was as if they'd simply evaporated.

""Mrs. Thorne,"" I began carefully, ""I understand the police are actively investigating-""

""They're looking in the wrong places,"" she cut me off. ""They're treating this like an isolated incident. It's not."" She reached into her bag and pulled out a manila folder, spreading its contents across my desk. Newspaper clippings, printouts from news websites, handwritten notes.

""1994, Twin boys, age 7, disappeared from a shopping center in Baltimore. 2001, Twin girls, age 7, vanished from a department store in Burlington, Vermont. 2008, Another set of twins, boys, age 7, last seen at a strip mall in Augusta, Maine."" Her finger stabbed at each article. ""2015, Twin girls-""

""All twins?"" I interrupted, leaning forward. ""All age seven?""

She nodded, her lips pressed into a thin line. ""Always during the Christmas shopping season. Always in the northeastern United States. Always seven-year-old twins. The police say I'm seeing patterns where there aren't any. That I'm a grieving mother grasping at straws.""

I studied the articles more closely. The similarities were unsettling. Each case remained unsolved. No bodies ever found, no ransom demands, no credible leads. Just children vanishing into thin air while their parents' backs were turned.

I took the case.

That was six months ago. Since then, I've driven thousands of miles, interviewed dozens of families, and filled three notebooks with observations and theories. I've also started sleeping with my lights on, double-checking my locks, and jumping at shadows. Because what I've found... what I'm still finding... it's worse than anything you can imagine.

The pattern goes back further than Mrs. Thorne knew. Much further. I've traced similar disappearances back to 1952, though the early cases are harder to verify. Always twins. Always seven years old. Always during the Christmas shopping season. But that's just the surface pattern, the obvious one. There are other connections, subtle details that make my skin crawl when I think about them too long.

In each case, security cameras malfunction at crucial moments. Not obviously – no sudden static or blank screens. The footage just becomes subtly corrupted, faces blurred just enough to be useless, timestamps skipping microseconds at critical moments. Every single time.

Then there are the witnesses. In each case, at least one person recalls seeing the children leaving the store or mall with ""their parent."" But the descriptions of this parent never match the actual parents, and yet they're also never quite consistent enough to build a reliable profile. ""Tall but not too tall."" ""Average looking, I think."" ""Wearing a dark coat... or maybe it was blue?"" It's like trying to describe someone you saw in a dream.

But the detail that keeps me up at night? In every single case, in the weeks leading up to the disappearance, someone reported seeing the twins playing with matchboxes. Not matchbox cars – actual matchboxes. Empty ones. Different witnesses, different locations, but always the same detail: children sliding empty matchboxes back and forth between them like some kind of game.

The Thorne twins were no exception. Their babysitter mentioned it to me in passing, something she'd noticed but hadn't thought important enough to tell the police. ""They'd sit for hours,"" she said, ""pushing these old matchboxes across the coffee table to each other. Never said a word while they did it. It was kind of creepy, actually. I threw the matchboxes away a few days before... before it happened.""

I've driven past the Providence Place Mall countless times since taking this case. Sometimes, late at night when the parking lot is almost empty, I park and watch the entrance where the Thorne twins were last seen. I've started noticing things. Small things. Like how the security cameras seem to turn slightly when no one's watching. Or how there's always at least one person walking through the lot who seems just a little too interested in the families going in and out.

Last week, I followed one of these observers. They led me on a winding route through Providence's east side, always staying just far enough ahead that I couldn't get a clear look at them. Finally, they turned down a dead-end alley. When I reached the alley, they were gone. But there, in the middle of the pavement, was a single empty matchbox.

I picked it up. Inside was a small piece of paper with an address in Portland, Maine. I've been sitting in my office for three days, staring at that matchbox, trying to decide what to do. The rational part of my brain says to turn everything over to the FBI. Let them connect the dots. Let them figure out why someone – or something – has been collecting seven-year-old twins for over seventy years.

But I know I won't. Because yesterday I received an email from a woman in Hartford. Her seven-year-old twins have started playing with matchboxes. Christmas is five months away.

I'm writing this down because I need someone to know what I've found, in case... in case something happens. I'm heading to Portland tomorrow. The address leads to an abandoned department store, according to Google Maps. I've arranged for this document to be automatically sent to several news outlets if I don't check in within 48 hours.

If you're reading this, it either means I'm dead, or I've found something so troubling that I've decided the world needs to know. Either way, if you have twins, or know someone who does, pay attention. Watch for the matchboxes. Don't let them play with matchboxes.

And whatever you do, don't let them out of your sight during Christmas shopping.

[Update - Day 1]

I'm in Portland now, parked across the street from the abandoned department store. It's one of those grand old buildings from the early 1900s, all ornate stonework and huge display windows, now covered with plywood. Holbrook & Sons, according to the faded lettering above the entrance. Something about it seems familiar, though I know I've never been here before.

The weird thing? When I looked up the building's history, I found that it closed in 1952 – the same year the twin disappearances started. The final day of business? December 24th.

I've been watching for three hours now. Twice, I've seen someone enter through a side door – different people each time, but they move the same way. Purposeful. Like they belong there. Like they're going to work.

My phone keeps glitching. The screen flickers whenever I try to take photos of the building. The last three shots came out completely black, even though it's broad daylight. The one before that... I had to delete it. It showed something standing in one of the windows. Something tall and thin that couldn't possibly have been there because all the windows are boarded up.

I found another matchbox on my hood when I came back from getting coffee. Inside was a key and another note: ""Loading dock. Midnight. Bring proof.""

Proof of what?

The sun is setting now. I've got six hours to decide if I'm really going to use that key. Six hours to decide if finding these children is worth risking becoming another disappearance statistic myself. Six hours to wonder what kind of proof they're expecting me to bring.

I keep thinking about something Mrs. Thorne said during one of our later conversations. She'd been looking through old family photos and noticed something odd. In pictures from the months before the twins disappeared, there were subtle changes in their appearance. Their eyes looked different – darker somehow, more hollow. And in the last photo, taken just two days before they vanished, they weren't looking at the camera. Both were staring at something off to the side, something outside the frame. And their expressions...

Mrs. Thorne couldn't finish describing those expressions. She just closed the photo album and asked me to leave.

I found the photo later, buried in the police evidence files. I wish I hadn't. I've seen a lot of frightened children in my line of work, but I've never seen children look afraid like that. It wasn't fear of something immediate, like a threat or a monster. It was the kind of fear that comes from knowing something. Something terrible. Something they couldn't tell anyone.

The same expression I've now found in photographs of other twins, taken days before they disappeared. Always the same hollow eyes. Always looking at something outside the frame.

I've got the key in my hand now. It's old, made of brass, heavy. The kind of key that opens serious locks. The kind of key that opens doors you maybe shouldn't open.

But those children... thirty-six sets of twins over seventy years. Seventy-two children who never got to grow up. Seventy-two families destroyed by Christmas shopping trips that ended in empty car seats and unopened presents.

The sun's almost gone now. The streetlights are coming on, but they seem dimmer than they should be. Or maybe that's just my imagination. Maybe everything about this case has been my imagination. Maybe I'll use that key at midnight and find nothing but an empty building full of dust and old memories.

But I don't think so.

Because I just looked at the last photo I managed to take before my phone started glitching. It's mostly black, but there's something in the darkness. A face. No – two faces. Pressed against one of those boarded-up windows.

They have pale green eyes.

[Update - Day 1, 11:45 PM]

I'm sitting in my car near the loading dock. Every instinct I have is screaming at me to drive away. Fast. But I can't. Not when I'm this close.

Something's happening at the building. Cars have been arriving for the past hour – expensive ones with tinted windows. They park in different locations around the block, never too close to each other. People get out – men and women in dark clothes – and disappear into various entrances. Like they're arriving for some kind of event.

The loading dock is around the back, accessed through an alley. No streetlights back there. Just darkness and the distant sound of the ocean. I've got my flashlight, my gun (for all the good it would do), and the key. And questions. So many questions.

Why here? Why twins? Why age seven? What's the significance of Christmas shopping? And why leave me a key?

The last question bothers me the most. They want me here. This isn't a break in the case – it's an invitation. But why?

11:55 PM now. Almost time. I'm going to leave my phone in the car, hidden, recording everything. If something happens to me, maybe it'll help explain...

Wait.

There's someone standing at the end of the alley. Just standing there. Watching my car. They're too far away to see clearly, but something about their proportions isn't quite right. Too tall. Too thin.

They're holding something. It looks like...

It looks like a matchbox.

Midnight. Time to go.


There was no key. No meeting. I couldn't bring myself to approach that loading dock.

Because at 11:57 PM, I saw something that made me realize I was never meant to enter that building. Not yet. Maybe not ever.

The figure at the end of the alley – the tall, thin one – started walking toward my car. Not the normal kind of walking. Each step was too long, too fluid, like someone had filmed a person walking and removed every other frame. As it got closer, I realized what had bothered me about its proportions. Its arms hung down past its knees. Way past its knees.

I sat there, paralyzed, as it approached my driver's side window. The streetlight behind it made it impossible to see its face, but I could smell something. Sweet, but wrong. Like fruit that's just started to rot.

It pressed something against my window. A matchbox. Inside the matchbox was a polaroid photograph.

I didn't call the police. I couldn't. Because the photo was of me, asleep in my bed, taken last night. In the background, standing in my bedroom doorway, were Kiernan and Brynn Thorne.

I drove. I don't remember deciding to drive, but I drove all night, taking random turns, going nowhere. Just trying to get away from that thing with the long arms, from that photograph, from the implications of what it meant.

The sun's coming up now. I'm parked at a rest stop somewhere in Massachusetts. I've been going through my notes, looking for something I missed. Some detail that might explain what's really happening.

I found something.

Remember those witness accounts I mentioned? The ones about seeing the twins leave with ""their parent""? I've been mapping them. Every single sighting, every location where someone reported seeing missing twins with an unidentifiable adult.

They form a pattern.

Plot them on a map and they make a shape. A perfect spiral, starting in Providence and growing outward across New England. Each incident exactly 27.3 miles from the last.

And if you follow the spiral inward, past Providence, to where it would logically begin?

That department store in Portland.

But here's what's really keeping me awake: if you follow the spiral outward, predicting where the next incident should be...

Hartford. Where those twins just started playing with matchboxes.

I need to make some calls. The families of the missing twins – not just the recent ones, but all of them. Every single case going back to 1952. Because I have a horrible suspicion...

[Update - Day 2, 5:22 PM]

I've spent all day on the phone. What I've found... I don't want it to be true.

Every family. Every single family of missing twins. Three months after their children disappeared, they received a matchbox in the mail. No return address. No note. Just an empty matchbox.

Except they weren't empty.

If you hold them up to the light just right, if you shake them in just the right way, you can hear something inside. Something that sounds like children whispering.

Mrs. Thorne should receive her matchbox in exactly one week.

I called her. Warned her not to open it when it arrives. She asked me why.

I couldn't tell her what the other parents told me. About what happened when they opened their matchboxes. About the dreams that started afterward. Dreams of their children playing in an endless department store, always just around the corner, always just out of sight. Dreams of long-armed figures arranging and rearranging toys on shelves that stretch up into darkness.

Dreams of their children trying to tell them something important. Something about the matchboxes. Something about why they had to play with them.

Something about what's coming to Hartford.

I think I finally understand why twins. Why seven-year-olds. Why Christmas shopping.

It's about innocence. About pairs. About symmetry.

And about breaking all three.

I've booked a hotel room in Hartford. I need to find those twins before they disappear. Before they become part of this pattern that's been spiraling outward for seventy years.

But first, I need to stop at my apartment. Get some clean clothes. Get my good camera. Get my case files.

I know that thing with the long arms might be waiting for me. I know the Thorne twins might be standing in my doorway again.

I'm going anyway.

Because I just realized something else about that spiral pattern. About the distance between incidents.

27.3 miles.

The exact distance light travels in the brief moment between identical twins being born.

The exact distance sound travels in the time it takes to strike a match.

[Update - Day 2, 8:45 PM]

I'm in my apartment. Everything looks normal. Nothing's been disturbed.

Except there's a toy department store catalog from 1952 on my kitchen table. I know it wasn't there this morning.

It's open to the Christmas section. Every child in every photo is a twin.

And they're all looking at something outside the frame.

All holding matchboxes.

All trying to warn us.


[Update - Day 2, 11:17 PM]

The catalog won't let me put it down.

I don't mean that metaphorically. Every time I try to set it aside, my fingers won't release it. Like it needs to be read. Like the pages need to be turned.

It's called ""Holbrook & Sons Christmas Catalog - 1952 Final Edition."" The cover shows the department store as it must have looked in its heyday: gleaming windows, bright lights, families streaming in and out. But something's wrong with the image. The longer I look at it, the more I notice that all the families entering the store have twins. All of them. And all the families leaving... they're missing their children.

The Christmas section starts on page 27. Every photo shows twin children modeling toys, clothes, or playing with holiday gifts. Their faces are blank, emotionless. And in every single photo, there's something in the background. A shadow. A suggestion of something tall and thin, just barely visible at the edge of the frame.

But it's the handwriting that's making my hands shake.

Someone has written notes in the margins. Different handwriting on each page. Different pens, different decades. Like people have been finding this catalog and adding to it for seventy years.

""They're trying to show us something."" (1963)
""The matchboxes are doors."" (1978)
""They only take twins because they need pairs. Everything has to have a pair."" (1991)
""Don't let them complete the spiral."" (2004)
""Hartford is the last point. After Hartford, the circle closes."" (2019)

The most recent note was written just weeks ago: ""When you see yourself in the mirror, look at your reflection's hands.""

I just tried it.

My reflection's hands were holding a matchbox.

I'm driving to Hartford now. I can't wait until morning. Those twins, the ones who just started playing with matchboxes – the Blackwood twins, Emma and Ethan – they live in the West End. Their mother posted about them on a local Facebook group, worried about their new ""obsession"" with matchboxes. Asking if any other parents had noticed similar behavior.

The catalog is on my passenger seat. It keeps falling open to page 52. There's a photo there that I've been avoiding looking at directly. It shows the toy department at Holbrook & Sons. Rows and rows of shelves stretching back into impossible darkness. And standing between those shelves...

I finally made myself look at it properly. Really look at it.

Those aren't mannequins arranging the toys.

[Update - Day 3, 1:33 AM]

I'm parked outside the Blackwood house. All the lights are off except one. Third floor, corner window. I can see shadows moving against the curtains. Small shadows. Child-sized shadows.

They're awake. Playing with matchboxes, probably.

I should go knock on the door. Wake the parents. Warn them.

But I can't stop staring at that window. Because every few minutes, there's another shadow. A much taller shadow. And its arms...

The catalog is open again. Page 73 now. It's an order form for something called a ""Twin's Special Holiday Package."" The description is blank except for one line:

""Every pair needs a keeper.""

The handwritten notes on this page are different. They're all the same message, written over and over in different hands:

""Don't let them take the children to the mirror department.""
""Don't let them take the children to the mirror department.""
""Don't let them take the children to the mirror department.""

The last one is written in fresh ink. Still wet.

My phone just buzzed. A text from an unknown number:
""Check the catalog index for 'Mirror Department - Special Services.'""

I know I shouldn't.

I'm going to anyway.

[Update - Day 3, 1:47 AM]

The index led me to page 127. The Mirror Department.

The photos on this page... they're not from 1952. They can't be. Because one of them shows the Thorne twins. Standing in front of a massive mirror in what looks like an old department store. But their reflection...

Their reflection shows them at different ages. Dozens of versions of them, stretching back into the mirror's depth. All holding matchboxes. All seven years old.

And behind each version, getting closer and closer to the foreground, one of those long-armed figures.

There's movement in the Blackwood house. Adult shapes passing by lit windows. The parents are awake.

But the children's shadows in the third-floor window aren't moving anymore. They're just standing there. Both holding something up to the window.

I don't need my binoculars to know what they're holding.

The catalog just fell open to the last page. There's only one sentence, printed in modern ink:

""The spiral ends where the mirrors begin.""

I can see someone walking up the street toward the house.

They're carrying a mirror.

[Update - Day 3, 2:15 AM]

I did something unforgivable. I let them take the Blackwood twins.

I sat in my car and watched as that thing with the long arms set up its mirror on their front lawn. Watched as the twins came downstairs and walked out their front door, matchboxes in hand. Watched as their parents slept through it all, unaware their children were walking into something ancient and hungry.

But I had to. Because I finally remembered what happened to my brother. What really happened that day at the mall.

And I understood why I became a private investigator.

The catalog is writing itself now. New pages appearing as I watch, filled with photos I took during this investigation. Only I never took these photos. In them, I'm the one being watched. In every crime scene photo, every surveillance shot, there's a reflection of me in a window or a puddle. And in each reflection, I'm standing next to a small boy. 

My twin brother. Still seven years old.

Still holding his matchbox.

[Update - Day 3, 3:33 AM]

I'm parked outside Holbrook & Sons again. The Blackwood twins are in there. I can feel them. Just like I can feel all the others. They're waiting.

The truth was in front of me the whole time. In every reflection, every window, every mirror I've passed in the fifteen years I've been investigating missing children.

We all have reflections. But reflections aren't supposed to remember. They're not supposed to want.

In 1952, something changed in the mirror department at Holbrook & Sons. Something went wrong with the symmetry of things. Reflections began to hunger. They needed pairs to be complete. Perfect pairs. Twins.

But only at age seven. Only when the original and the reflection are still similar enough to switch places.

The long-armed things? They're not kidnappers. They're what happens to reflections that stay in mirrors too long. That stretch themselves trying to reach through the glass. That hunger for the warmth of the real.

I know because I've been helping them. For fifteen years, I've been investigating missing twins, following the spiral pattern, documenting everything.

Only it wasn't me doing the investigating.

It was my reflection.

[Update - Day 3, 4:44 AM]

I'm at the loading dock now. The door is open. Inside, I can hear children playing. Laughing. The sound of matchboxes sliding across glass.

The catalog's final page shows a photo taken today. In it, I'm standing in front of a department store mirror. But my reflection isn't mimicking my movements. It's smiling. Standing next to it is my brother, still seven years old, still wearing the clothes he disappeared in.

He's holding out a matchbox to me.

And now I remember everything.

The day my brother disappeared, we weren't just shopping. We were playing a game with matchboxes. Sliding them back and forth to each other in front of the mirrors in the department store. Each time we slid them, our reflections moved a little differently. Became a little more real.

Until one of us stepped through the mirror.

But here's the thing about mirrors and twins.

When identical twins look at their reflection, how do they know which side of the mirror they're really on?

I've spent fifteen years investigating missing twins. Fifteen years trying to find my brother. Fifteen years helping gather more twins, more pairs, more reflections.

Because the thing in the mirror department at Holbrook & Sons? It's not collecting twins.

It's collecting originals.

Real children. Real warmth. Real life.

To feed all the reflections that have been trapped in mirrors since 1952. To give them what they've always wanted:

A chance to be real.

The door to the mirror department is open now. Inside, I can see them all. Every twin that's disappeared since 1952. All still seven years old. All still playing with their matchboxes.

All waiting to trade places. Just like my brother and I did.

Just like I've been helping other twins do for fifteen years.

Because I'm not August Reed, the private investigator who lost his twin brother in 1992.

I'm August Reed's reflection.

And now that the spiral is complete, now that we have enough pairs...

We can all step through.

All of us.

Every reflection. Every mirror image. Every shadow that's ever hungered to be real.

The matchbox in my hand is the same one my real self gave me in 1992.

Inside, I can hear my brother whispering:

""Your turn to be the reflection.""

[Final Update - Day 3, 5:55 AM]

Some things can only be broken by their exact opposites.

That's what my brother was trying to tell me through the matchbox all these years. Not ""your turn to be the reflection,"" but a warning: ""Don't let them take your turn at reflection.""

The matchboxes aren't tools for switching places. They're weapons. The only weapons that work against reflections. Because inside each one is a moment of perfect symmetry – the brief flare of a match creating identical light and shadow. The exact thing reflections can't replicate.

I know this because I'm not really August Reed's reflection.

I'm August Reed. The real one. The one who's spent fifteen years pretending to be fooled by his own reflection. Investigating disappearances while secretly learning the truth. Getting closer and closer to the center of the spiral.

My reflection thinks it's been manipulating me. Leading me here to complete some grand design. It doesn't understand that every investigation, every documented case, every mile driven was bringing me closer to the one thing it fears:

The moment when all the stolen children strike their matches at once.

[Update - Day 3, 6:27 AM]

I'm in the mirror department now. Every reflection of every twin since 1952 is here, thinking they've won. Thinking they're about to step through their mirrors and take our places.

Behind them, in the darkened store beyond the glass, I can see the real children. All still seven years old, because time moves differently in reflections. All holding their matchboxes. All waiting for the signal.

My reflection is smiling at me, standing next to what it thinks is my brother.

""The spiral is complete,"" it says. ""Time to make every reflection real.""

I smile back.

And I light my match.

The flash reflects off every mirror in the department. Multiplies. Amplifies. Every twin in every reflection strikes their match at the exact same moment. Light bouncing from mirror to mirror, creating a perfect spiral of synchronized flame.

But something goes wrong.

The light isn't perfect. The symmetry isn't complete. The spiral wavers.

I realize too late what's happened. Some of the children have been here too long. Spent too many years as reflections. The mirrors have claimed them so completely that they can't break free.

Including my brother.

[Final Entry - Day 3, Sunrise]

It's over, but victory tastes like ashes.

The mirrors are cracked, their surfaces no longer perfect enough to hold reflections that think and want and hunger. The long-armed things are gone. The spiral is broken.

But we couldn't save them all.

Most of the children were too far gone. Seven decades of living as reflections had made them more mirror than human. When the symmetry broke, they... faded. Became like old photographs, growing dimmer and dimmer until they were just shadows on broken glass.

Only the Thorne twins made it out. Only they were new enough, real enough, to survive the breaking of the mirrors. They're aging now, quickly but safely, their bodies catching up to the years they lost. Soon they'll be back with their mother, with only vague memories of a strange dream about matchboxes and mirrors.

The others... we had to let them go. My brother included. He looked at me one last time before he faded, and I saw peace in his eyes. He knew what his sacrifice meant. Knew that breaking the mirrors would save all the future twins who might have been taken.

The building will be demolished tomorrow. The mirrors will be destroyed properly, safely. The matchboxes will be burned.

But first, I have to tell sixty-nine families that their children aren't coming home. That their twins are neither dead nor alive, but something in between. Caught forever in that strange space between reality and reflection.

Sometimes, in department stores, I catch glimpses of them in the mirrors. Seven-year-olds playing with matchboxes, slowly fading like old polaroids. Still together. Still twins. Still perfect pairs, even if they're only pairs of shadows now.

This will be my last case as a private investigator. I've seen enough reflections for one lifetime.

But every Christmas shopping season, I stand guard at malls and department stores. Watching for long-armed figures. Looking for children playing with matchboxes.

Because the spiral may be broken, but mirrors have long memories.

And somewhere, in the spaces between reflection and reality, seventy years' worth of seven-year-old twins are still playing their matchbox games.

Still waiting.

Still watching.

Just to make sure it never happens again.

I've been a private investigator for fifteen years. Mostly routine stuff – insurance fraud, cheating spouses, corporate espionage. The cases that keep the lights on but don't keep you up at night. That changed when Margaret Thorne walked into my office three days after Christmas, clutching a crumpled Macy's shopping bag like it was the only thing keeping her tethered to reality.

My name is August Reed. I operate out of a small office in Providence, Rhode Island, and I'm about to tell you about the case that made me seriously consider burning my PI license and opening a coffee shop somewhere quiet. Somewhere far from the East Coast. Somewhere where children don't disappear.

Mrs. Thorne was a composed woman, early forties, with the kind of rigid posture that speaks of old money and private schools. But her hands shook as she placed two school photos on my desk. Kiernan and Brynn Thorne, identical twins, seven years old. Both had striking auburn hair and those peculiar pale green eyes you sometimes see in Irish families.

""They vanished at the Providence Place Mall,"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. ""December 22nd, between 2:17 and 2:24 PM. Seven minutes. I only looked away for seven minutes.""

I'd seen the news coverage, of course. Twin children disappearing during Christmas shopping – it was the kind of story that dominated local headlines. The police had conducted an extensive search, but so far had turned up nothing. Mall security footage showed the twins entering the toy store with their mother but never leaving. It was as if they'd simply evaporated.

""Mrs. Thorne,"" I began carefully, ""I understand the police are actively investigating-""

""They're looking in the wrong places,"" she cut me off. ""They're treating this like an isolated incident. It's not."" She reached into her bag and pulled out a manila folder, spreading its contents across my desk. Newspaper clippings, printouts from news websites, handwritten notes.

""1994, Twin boys, age 7, disappeared from a shopping center in Baltimore. 2001, Twin girls, age 7, vanished from a department store in Burlington, Vermont. 2008, Another set of twins, boys, age 7, last seen at a strip mall in Augusta, Maine."" Her finger stabbed at each article. ""2015, Twin girls-""

""All twins?"" I interrupted, leaning forward. ""All age seven?""

She nodded, her lips pressed into a thin line. ""Always during the Christmas shopping season. Always in the northeastern United States. Always seven-year-old twins. The police say I'm seeing patterns where there aren't any. That I'm a grieving mother grasping at straws.""

I studied the articles more closely. The similarities were unsettling. Each case remained unsolved. No bodies ever found, no ransom demands, no credible leads. Just children vanishing into thin air while their parents' backs were turned.

I took the case.

That was six months ago. Since then, I've driven thousands of miles, interviewed dozens of families, and filled three notebooks with observations and theories. I've also started sleeping with my lights on, double-checking my locks, and jumping at shadows. Because what I've found... what I'm still finding... it's worse than anything you can imagine.

The pattern goes back further than Mrs. Thorne knew. Much further. I've traced similar disappearances back to 1952, though the early cases are harder to verify. Always twins. Always seven years old. Always during the Christmas shopping season. But that's just the surface pattern, the obvious one. There are other connections, subtle details that make my skin crawl when I think about them too long.

In each case, security cameras malfunction at crucial moments. Not obviously – no sudden static or blank screens. The footage just becomes subtly corrupted, faces blurred just enough to be useless, timestamps skipping microseconds at critical moments. Every single time.

Then there are the witnesses. In each case, at least one person recalls seeing the children leaving the store or mall with ""their parent."" But the descriptions of this parent never match the actual parents, and yet they're also never quite consistent enough to build a reliable profile. ""Tall but not too tall."" ""Average looking, I think."" ""Wearing a dark coat... or maybe it was blue?"" It's like trying to describe someone you saw in a dream.

But the detail that keeps me up at night? In every single case, in the weeks leading up to the disappearance, someone reported seeing the twins playing with matchboxes. Not matchbox cars – actual matchboxes. Empty ones. Different witnesses, different locations, but always the same detail: children sliding empty matchboxes back and forth between them like some kind of game.

The Thorne twins were no exception. Their babysitter mentioned it to me in passing, something she'd noticed but hadn't thought important enough to tell the police. ""They'd sit for hours,"" she said, ""pushing these old matchboxes across the coffee table to each other. Never said a word while they did it. It was kind of creepy, actually. I threw the matchboxes away a few days before... before it happened.""

I've driven past the Providence Place Mall countless times since taking this case. Sometimes, late at night when the parking lot is almost empty, I park and watch the entrance where the Thorne twins were last seen. I've started noticing things. Small things. Like how the security cameras seem to turn slightly when no one's watching. Or how there's always at least one person walking through the lot who seems just a little too interested in the families going in and out.

Last week, I followed one of these observers. They led me on a winding route through Providence's east side, always staying just far enough ahead that I couldn't get a clear look at them. Finally, they turned down a dead-end alley. When I reached the alley, they were gone. But there, in the middle of the pavement, was a single empty matchbox.

I picked it up. Inside was a small piece of paper with an address in Portland, Maine. I've been sitting in my office for three days, staring at that matchbox, trying to decide what to do. The rational part of my brain says to turn everything over to the FBI. Let them connect the dots. Let them figure out why someone – or something – has been collecting seven-year-old twins for over seventy years.

But I know I won't. Because yesterday I received an email from a woman in Hartford. Her seven-year-old twins have started playing with matchboxes. Christmas is five months away.

I'm writing this down because I need someone to know what I've found, in case... in case something happens. I'm heading to Portland tomorrow. The address leads to an abandoned department store, according to Google Maps. I've arranged for this document to be automatically sent to several news outlets if I don't check in within 48 hours.

If you're reading this, it either means I'm dead, or I've found something so troubling that I've decided the world needs to know. Either way, if you have twins, or know someone who does, pay attention. Watch for the matchboxes. Don't let them play with matchboxes.

And whatever you do, don't let them out of your sight during Christmas shopping.

[Update - Day 1]

I'm in Portland now, parked across the street from the abandoned department store. It's one of those grand old buildings from the early 1900s, all ornate stonework and huge display windows, now covered with plywood. Holbrook & Sons, according to the faded lettering above the entrance. Something about it seems familiar, though I know I've never been here before.

The weird thing? When I looked up the building's history, I found that it closed in 1952 – the same year the twin disappearances started. The final day of business? December 24th.

I've been watching for three hours now. Twice, I've seen someone enter through a side door – different people each time, but they move the same way. Purposeful. Like they belong there. Like they're going to work.

My phone keeps glitching. The screen flickers whenever I try to take photos of the building. The last three shots came out completely black, even though it's broad daylight. The one before that... I had to delete it. It showed something standing in one of the windows. Something tall and thin that couldn't possibly have been there because all the windows are boarded up.

I found another matchbox on my hood when I came back from getting coffee. Inside was a key and another note: ""Loading dock. Midnight. Bring proof.""

Proof of what?

The sun is setting now. I've got six hours to decide if I'm really going to use that key. Six hours to decide if finding these children is worth risking becoming another disappearance statistic myself. Six hours to wonder what kind of proof they're expecting me to bring.

I keep thinking about something Mrs. Thorne said during one of our later conversations. She'd been looking through old family photos and noticed something odd. In pictures from the months before the twins disappeared, there were subtle changes in their appearance. Their eyes looked different – darker somehow, more hollow. And in the last photo, taken just two days before they vanished, they weren't looking at the camera. Both were staring at something off to the side, something outside the frame. And their expressions...

Mrs. Thorne couldn't finish describing those expressions. She just closed the photo album and asked me to leave.

I found the photo later, buried in the police evidence files. I wish I hadn't. I've seen a lot of frightened children in my line of work, but I've never seen children look afraid like that. It wasn't fear of something immediate, like a threat or a monster. It was the kind of fear that comes from knowing something. Something terrible. Something they couldn't tell anyone.

The same expression I've now found in photographs of other twins, taken days before they disappeared. Always the same hollow eyes. Always looking at something outside the frame.

I've got the key in my hand now. It's old, made of brass, heavy. The kind of key that opens serious locks. The kind of key that opens doors you maybe shouldn't open.

But those children... thirty-six sets of twins over seventy years. Seventy-two children who never got to grow up. Seventy-two families destroyed by Christmas shopping trips that ended in empty car seats and unopened presents.

The sun's almost gone now. The streetlights are coming on, but they seem dimmer than they should be. Or maybe that's just my imagination. Maybe everything about this case has been my imagination. Maybe I'll use that key at midnight and find nothing but an empty building full of dust and old memories.

But I don't think so.

Because I just looked at the last photo I managed to take before my phone started glitching. It's mostly black, but there's something in the darkness. A face. No – two faces. Pressed against one of those boarded-up windows.

They have pale green eyes.

[Update - Day 1, 11:45 PM]

I'm sitting in my car near the loading dock. Every instinct I have is screaming at me to drive away. Fast. But I can't. Not when I'm this close.

Something's happening at the building. Cars have been arriving for the past hour – expensive ones with tinted windows. They park in different locations around the block, never too close to each other. People get out – men and women in dark clothes – and disappear into various entrances. Like they're arriving for some kind of event.

The loading dock is around the back, accessed through an alley. No streetlights back there. Just darkness and the distant sound of the ocean. I've got my flashlight, my gun (for all the good it would do), and the key. And questions. So many questions.

Why here? Why twins? Why age seven? What's the significance of Christmas shopping? And why leave me a key?

The last question bothers me the most. They want me here. This isn't a break in the case – it's an invitation. But why?

11:55 PM now. Almost time. I'm going to leave my phone in the car, hidden, recording everything. If something happens to me, maybe it'll help explain...

Wait.

There's someone standing at the end of the alley. Just standing there. Watching my car. They're too far away to see clearly, but something about their proportions isn't quite right. Too tall. Too thin.

They're holding something. It looks like...

It looks like a matchbox.

Midnight. Time to go.


There was no key. No meeting. I couldn't bring myself to approach that loading dock.

Because at 11:57 PM, I saw something that made me realize I was never meant to enter that building. Not yet. Maybe not ever.

The figure at the end of the alley – the tall, thin one – started walking toward my car. Not the normal kind of walking. Each step was too long, too fluid, like someone had filmed a person walking and removed every other frame. As it got closer, I realized what had bothered me about its proportions. Its arms hung down past its knees. Way past its knees.

I sat there, paralyzed, as it approached my driver's side window. The streetlight behind it made it impossible to see its face, but I could smell something. Sweet, but wrong. Like fruit that's just started to rot.

It pressed something against my window. A matchbox. Inside the matchbox was a polaroid photograph.

I didn't call the police. I couldn't. Because the photo was of me, asleep in my bed, taken last night. In the background, standing in my bedroom doorway, were Kiernan and Brynn Thorne.

I drove. I don't remember deciding to drive, but I drove all night, taking random turns, going nowhere. Just trying to get away from that thing with the long arms, from that photograph, from the implications of what it meant.

The sun's coming up now. I'm parked at a rest stop somewhere in Massachusetts. I've been going through my notes, looking for something I missed. Some detail that might explain what's really happening.

I found something.

Remember those witness accounts I mentioned? The ones about seeing the twins leave with ""their parent""? I've been mapping them. Every single sighting, every location where someone reported seeing missing twins with an unidentifiable adult.

They form a pattern.

Plot them on a map and they make a shape. A perfect spiral, starting in Providence and growing outward across New England. Each incident exactly 27.3 miles from the last.

And if you follow the spiral inward, past Providence, to where it would logically begin?

That department store in Portland.

But here's what's really keeping me awake: if you follow the spiral outward, predicting where the next incident should be...

Hartford. Where those twins just started playing with matchboxes.

I need to make some calls. The families of the missing twins – not just the recent ones, but all of them. Every single case going back to 1952. Because I have a horrible suspicion...

[Update - Day 2, 5:22 PM]

I've spent all day on the phone. What I've found... I don't want it to be true.

Every family. Every single family of missing twins. Three months after their children disappeared, they received a matchbox in the mail. No return address. No note. Just an empty matchbox.

Except they weren't empty.

If you hold them up to the light just right, if you shake them in just the right way, you can hear something inside. Something that sounds like children whispering.

Mrs. Thorne should receive her matchbox in exactly one week.

I called her. Warned her not to open it when it arrives. She asked me why.

I couldn't tell her what the other parents told me. About what happened when they opened their matchboxes. About the dreams that started afterward. Dreams of their children playing in an endless department store, always just around the corner, always just out of sight. Dreams of long-armed figures arranging and rearranging toys on shelves that stretch up into darkness.

Dreams of their children trying to tell them something important. Something about the matchboxes. Something about why they had to play with them.

Something about what's coming to Hartford.

I think I finally understand why twins. Why seven-year-olds. Why Christmas shopping.

It's about innocence. About pairs. About symmetry.

And about breaking all three.

I've booked a hotel room in Hartford. I need to find those twins before they disappear. Before they become part of this pattern that's been spiraling outward for seventy years.

But first, I need to stop at my apartment. Get some clean clothes. Get my good camera. Get my case files.

I know that thing with the long arms might be waiting for me. I know the Thorne twins might be standing in my doorway again.

I'm going anyway.

Because I just realized something else about that spiral pattern. About the distance between incidents.

27.3 miles.

The exact distance light travels in the brief moment between identical twins being born.

The exact distance sound travels in the time it takes to strike a match.

[Update - Day 2, 8:45 PM]

I'm in my apartment. Everything looks normal. Nothing's been disturbed.

Except there's a toy department store catalog from 1952 on my kitchen table. I know it wasn't there this morning.

It's open to the Christmas section. Every child in every photo is a twin.

And they're all looking at something outside the frame.

All holding matchboxes.

All trying to warn us.


[Update - Day 2, 11:17 PM]

The catalog won't let me put it down.

I don't mean that metaphorically. Every time I try to set it aside, my fingers won't release it. Like it needs to be read. Like the pages need to be turned.

It's called ""Holbrook & Sons Christmas Catalog - 1952 Final Edition."" The cover shows the department store as it must have looked in its heyday: gleaming windows, bright lights, families streaming in and out. But something's wrong with the image. The longer I look at it, the more I notice that all the families entering the store have twins. All of them. And all the families leaving... they're missing their children.

The Christmas section starts on page 27. Every photo shows twin children modeling toys, clothes, or playing with holiday gifts. Their faces are blank, emotionless. And in every single photo, there's something in the background. A shadow. A suggestion of something tall and thin, just barely visible at the edge of the frame.

But it's the handwriting that's making my hands shake.

Someone has written notes in the margins. Different handwriting on each page. Different pens, different decades. Like people have been finding this catalog and adding to it for seventy years.

""They're trying to show us something."" (1963)
""The matchboxes are doors."" (1978)
""They only take twins because they need pairs. Everything has to have a pair."" (1991)
""Don't let them complete the spiral."" (2004)
""Hartford is the last point. After Hartford, the circle closes."" (2019)

The most recent note was written just weeks ago: ""When you see yourself in the mirror, look at your reflection's hands.""

I just tried it.

My reflection's hands were holding a matchbox.

I'm driving to Hartford now. I can't wait until morning. Those twins, the ones who just started playing with matchboxes – the Blackwood twins, Emma and Ethan – they live in the West End. Their mother posted about them on a local Facebook group, worried about their new ""obsession"" with matchboxes. Asking if any other parents had noticed similar behavior.

The catalog is on my passenger seat. It keeps falling open to page 52. There's a photo there that I've been avoiding looking at directly. It shows the toy department at Holbrook & Sons. Rows and rows of shelves stretching back into impossible darkness. And standing between those shelves...

I finally made myself look at it properly. Really look at it.

Those aren't mannequins arranging the toys.

[Update - Day 3, 1:33 AM]

I'm parked outside the Blackwood house. All the lights are off except one. Third floor, corner window. I can see shadows moving against the curtains. Small shadows. Child-sized shadows.

They're awake. Playing with matchboxes, probably.

I should go knock on the door. Wake the parents. Warn them.

But I can't stop staring at that window. Because every few minutes, there's another shadow. A much taller shadow. And its arms...

The catalog is open again. Page 73 now. It's an order form for something called a ""Twin's Special Holiday Package."" The description is blank except for one line:

""Every pair needs a keeper.""

The handwritten notes on this page are different. They're all the same message, written over and over in different hands:

""Don't let them take the children to the mirror department.""
""Don't let them take the children to the mirror department.""
""Don't let them take the children to the mirror department.""

The last one is written in fresh ink. Still wet.

My phone just buzzed. A text from an unknown number:
""Check the catalog index for 'Mirror Department - Special Services.'""

I know I shouldn't.

I'm going to anyway.

[Update - Day 3, 1:47 AM]

The index led me to page 127. The Mirror Department.

The photos on this page... they're not from 1952. They can't be. Because one of them shows the Thorne twins. Standing in front of a massive mirror in what looks like an old department store. But their reflection...

Their reflection shows them at different ages. Dozens of versions of them, stretching back into the mirror's depth. All holding matchboxes. All seven years old.

And behind each version, getting closer and closer to the foreground, one of those long-armed figures.

There's movement in the Blackwood house. Adult shapes passing by lit windows. The parents are awake.

But the children's shadows in the third-floor window aren't moving anymore. They're just standing there. Both holding something up to the window.

I don't need my binoculars to know what they're holding.

The catalog just fell open to the last page. There's only one sentence, printed in modern ink:

""The spiral ends where the mirrors begin.""

I can see someone walking up the street toward the house.

They're carrying a mirror.

[Update - Day 3, 2:15 AM]

I did something unforgivable. I let them take the Blackwood twins.

I sat in my car and watched as that thing with the long arms set up its mirror on their front lawn. Watched as the twins came downstairs and walked out their front door, matchboxes in hand. Watched as their parents slept through it all, unaware their children were walking into something ancient and hungry.

But I had to. Because I finally remembered what happened to my brother. What really happened that day at the mall.

And I understood why I became a private investigator.

The catalog is writing itself now. New pages appearing as I watch, filled with photos I took during this investigation. Only I never took these photos. In them, I'm the one being watched. In every crime scene photo, every surveillance shot, there's a reflection of me in a window or a puddle. And in each reflection, I'm standing next to a small boy. 

My twin brother. Still seven years old.

Still holding his matchbox.

[Update - Day 3, 3:33 AM]

I'm parked outside Holbrook & Sons again. The Blackwood twins are in there. I can feel them. Just like I can feel all the others. They're waiting.

The truth was in front of me the whole time. In every reflection, every window, every mirror I've passed in the fifteen years I've been investigating missing children.

We all have reflections. But reflections aren't supposed to remember. They're not supposed to want.

In 1952, something changed in the mirror department at Holbrook & Sons. Something went wrong with the symmetry of things. Reflections began to hunger. They needed pairs to be complete. Perfect pairs. Twins.

But only at age seven. Only when the original and the reflection are still similar enough to switch places.

The long-armed things? They're not kidnappers. They're what happens to reflections that stay in mirrors too long. That stretch themselves trying to reach through the glass. That hunger for the warmth of the real.

I know because I've been helping them. For fifteen years, I've been investigating missing twins, following the spiral pattern, documenting everything.

Only it wasn't me doing the investigating.

It was my reflection.

[Update - Day 3, 4:44 AM]

I'm at the loading dock now. The door is open. Inside, I can hear children playing. Laughing. The sound of matchboxes sliding across glass.

The catalog's final page shows a photo taken today. In it, I'm standing in front of a department store mirror. But my reflection isn't mimicking my movements. It's smiling. Standing next to it is my brother, still seven years old, still wearing the clothes he disappeared in.

He's holding out a matchbox to me.

And now I remember everything.

The day my brother disappeared, we weren't just shopping. We were playing a game with matchboxes. Sliding them back and forth to each other in front of the mirrors in the department store. Each time we slid them, our reflections moved a little differently. Became a little more real.

Until one of us stepped through the mirror.

But here's the thing about mirrors and twins.

When identical twins look at their reflection, how do they know which side of the mirror they're really on?

I've spent fifteen years investigating missing twins. Fifteen years trying to find my brother. Fifteen years helping gather more twins, more pairs, more reflections.

Because the thing in the mirror department at Holbrook & Sons? It's not collecting twins.

It's collecting originals.

Real children. Real warmth. Real life.

To feed all the reflections that have been trapped in mirrors since 1952. To give them what they've always wanted:

A chance to be real.

The door to the mirror department is open now. Inside, I can see them all. Every twin that's disappeared since 1952. All still seven years old. All still playing with their matchboxes.

All waiting to trade places. Just like my brother and I did.

Just like I've been helping other twins do for fifteen years.

Because I'm not August Reed, the private investigator who lost his twin brother in 1992.

I'm August Reed's reflection.

And now that the spiral is complete, now that we have enough pairs...

We can all step through.

All of us.

Every reflection. Every mirror image. Every shadow that's ever hungered to be real.

The matchbox in my hand is the same one my real self gave me in 1992.

Inside, I can hear my brother whispering:

""Your turn to be the reflection.""

[Final Update - Day 3, 5:55 AM]

Some things can only be broken by their exact opposites.

That's what my brother was trying to tell me through the matchbox all these years. Not ""your turn to be the reflection,"" but a warning: ""Don't let them take your turn at reflection.""

The matchboxes aren't tools for switching places. They're weapons. The only weapons that work against reflections. Because inside each one is a moment of perfect symmetry – the brief flare of a match creating identical light and shadow. The exact thing reflections can't replicate.

I know this because I'm not really August Reed's reflection.

I'm August Reed. The real one. The one who's spent fifteen years pretending to be fooled by his own reflection. Investigating disappearances while secretly learning the truth. Getting closer and closer to the center of the spiral.

My reflection thinks it's been manipulating me. Leading me here to complete some grand design. It doesn't understand that every investigation, every documented case, every mile driven was bringing me closer to the one thing it fears:

The moment when all the stolen children strike their matches at once.

[Update - Day 3, 6:27 AM]

I'm in the mirror department now. Every reflection of every twin since 1952 is here, thinking they've won. Thinking they're about to step through their mirrors and take our places.

Behind them, in the darkened store beyond the glass, I can see the real children. All still seven years old, because time moves differently in reflections. All holding their matchboxes. All waiting for the signal.

My reflection is smiling at me, standing next to what it thinks is my brother.

""The spiral is complete,"" it says. ""Time to make every reflection real.""

I smile back.

And I light my match.

The flash reflects off every mirror in the department. Multiplies. Amplifies. Every twin in every reflection strikes their match at the exact same moment. Light bouncing from mirror to mirror, creating a perfect spiral of synchronized flame.

But something goes wrong.

The light isn't perfect. The symmetry isn't complete. The spiral wavers.

I realize too late what's happened. Some of the children have been here too long. Spent too many years as reflections. The mirrors have claimed them so completely that they can't break free.

Including my brother.

[Final Entry - Day 3, Sunrise]

It's over, but victory tastes like ashes.

The mirrors are cracked, their surfaces no longer perfect enough to hold reflections that think and want and hunger. The long-armed things are gone. The spiral is broken.

But we couldn't save them all.

Most of the children were too far gone. Seven decades of living as reflections had made them more mirror than human. When the symmetry broke, they... faded. Became like old photographs, growing dimmer and dimmer until they were just shadows on broken glass.

Only the Thorne twins made it out. Only they were new enough, real enough, to survive the breaking of the mirrors. They're aging now, quickly but safely, their bodies catching up to the years they lost. Soon they'll be back with their mother, with only vague memories of a strange dream about matchboxes and mirrors.

The others... we had to let them go. My brother included. He looked at me one last time before he faded, and I saw peace in his eyes. He knew what his sacrifice meant. Knew that breaking the mirrors would save all the future twins who might have been taken.

The building will be demolished tomorrow. The mirrors will be destroyed properly, safely. The matchboxes will be burned.

But first, I have to tell sixty-nine families that their children aren't coming home. That their twins are neither dead nor alive, but something in between. Caught forever in that strange space between reality and reflection.

Sometimes, in department stores, I catch glimpses of them in the mirrors. Seven-year-olds playing with matchboxes, slowly fading like old polaroids. Still together. Still twins. Still perfect pairs, even if they're only pairs of shadows now.

This will be my last case as a private investigator. I've seen enough reflections for one lifetime.

But every Christmas shopping season, I stand guard at malls and department stores. Watching for long-armed figures. Looking for children playing with matchboxes.

Because the spiral may be broken, but mirrors have long memories.

And somewhere, in the spaces between reflection and reality, seventy years' worth of seven-year-old twins are still playing their matchbox games.

Still waiting.

Still watching.

Just to make sure it never happens again.

1hlnm5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllureStories/comments/1hlnm5g/twins_continue_to_go_missing_during_the_christmas/,"Twins continue to go missing during the Christmas season, The truth is revealing itself","
I've been a private investigator for fifteen years. Mostly routine stuff – insurance fraud, cheating spouses, corporate espionage. The cases that keep the lights on but don't keep you up at night. That changed when Margaret Thorne walked into my office three days after Christmas, clutching a crumpled Macy's shopping bag like it was the only thing keeping her tethered to reality.

My name is August Reed. I operate out of a small office in Providence, Rhode Island, and I'm about to tell you about the case that made me seriously consider burning my PI license and opening a coffee shop somewhere quiet. Somewhere far from the East Coast. Somewhere where children don't disappear.

Mrs. Thorne was a composed woman, early forties, with the kind of rigid posture that speaks of old money and private schools. But her hands shook as she placed two school photos on my desk. Kiernan and Brynn Thorne, identical twins, seven years old. Both had striking auburn hair and those peculiar pale green eyes you sometimes see in Irish families.

""They vanished at the Providence Place Mall,"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. ""December 22nd, between 2:17 and 2:24 PM. Seven minutes. I only looked away for seven minutes.""

I'd seen the news coverage, of course. Twin children disappearing during Christmas shopping – it was the kind of story that dominated local headlines. The police had conducted an extensive search, but so far had turned up nothing. Mall security footage showed the twins entering the toy store with their mother but never leaving. It was as if they'd simply evaporated.

""Mrs. Thorne,"" I began carefully, ""I understand the police are actively investigating-""

""They're looking in the wrong places,"" she cut me off. ""They're treating this like an isolated incident. It's not."" She reached into her bag and pulled out a manila folder, spreading its contents across my desk. Newspaper clippings, printouts from news websites, handwritten notes.

""1994, Twin boys, age 7, disappeared from a shopping center in Baltimore. 2001, Twin girls, age 7, vanished from a department store in Burlington, Vermont. 2008, Another set of twins, boys, age 7, last seen at a strip mall in Augusta, Maine."" Her finger stabbed at each article. ""2015, Twin girls-""

""All twins?"" I interrupted, leaning forward. ""All age seven?""

She nodded, her lips pressed into a thin line. ""Always during the Christmas shopping season. Always in the northeastern United States. Always seven-year-old twins. The police say I'm seeing patterns where there aren't any. That I'm a grieving mother grasping at straws.""

I studied the articles more closely. The similarities were unsettling. Each case remained unsolved. No bodies ever found, no ransom demands, no credible leads. Just children vanishing into thin air while their parents' backs were turned.

I took the case.

That was six months ago. Since then, I've driven thousands of miles, interviewed dozens of families, and filled three notebooks with observations and theories. I've also started sleeping with my lights on, double-checking my locks, and jumping at shadows. Because what I've found... what I'm still finding... it's worse than anything you can imagine.

The pattern goes back further than Mrs. Thorne knew. Much further. I've traced similar disappearances back to 1952, though the early cases are harder to verify. Always twins. Always seven years old. Always during the Christmas shopping season. But that's just the surface pattern, the obvious one. There are other connections, subtle details that make my skin crawl when I think about them too long.

In each case, security cameras malfunction at crucial moments. Not obviously – no sudden static or blank screens. The footage just becomes subtly corrupted, faces blurred just enough to be useless, timestamps skipping microseconds at critical moments. Every single time.

Then there are the witnesses. In each case, at least one person recalls seeing the children leaving the store or mall with ""their parent."" But the descriptions of this parent never match the actual parents, and yet they're also never quite consistent enough to build a reliable profile. ""Tall but not too tall."" ""Average looking, I think."" ""Wearing a dark coat... or maybe it was blue?"" It's like trying to describe someone you saw in a dream.

But the detail that keeps me up at night? In every single case, in the weeks leading up to the disappearance, someone reported seeing the twins playing with matchboxes. Not matchbox cars – actual matchboxes. Empty ones. Different witnesses, different locations, but always the same detail: children sliding empty matchboxes back and forth between them like some kind of game.

The Thorne twins were no exception. Their babysitter mentioned it to me in passing, something she'd noticed but hadn't thought important enough to tell the police. ""They'd sit for hours,"" she said, ""pushing these old matchboxes across the coffee table to each other. Never said a word while they did it. It was kind of creepy, actually. I threw the matchboxes away a few days before... before it happened.""

I've driven past the Providence Place Mall countless times since taking this case. Sometimes, late at night when the parking lot is almost empty, I park and watch the entrance where the Thorne twins were last seen. I've started noticing things. Small things. Like how the security cameras seem to turn slightly when no one's watching. Or how there's always at least one person walking through the lot who seems just a little too interested in the families going in and out.

Last week, I followed one of these observers. They led me on a winding route through Providence's east side, always staying just far enough ahead that I couldn't get a clear look at them. Finally, they turned down a dead-end alley. When I reached the alley, they were gone. But there, in the middle of the pavement, was a single empty matchbox.

I picked it up. Inside was a small piece of paper with an address in Portland, Maine. I've been sitting in my office for three days, staring at that matchbox, trying to decide what to do. The rational part of my brain says to turn everything over to the FBI. Let them connect the dots. Let them figure out why someone – or something – has been collecting seven-year-old twins for over seventy years.

But I know I won't. Because yesterday I received an email from a woman in Hartford. Her seven-year-old twins have started playing with matchboxes. Christmas is five months away.

I'm writing this down because I need someone to know what I've found, in case... in case something happens. I'm heading to Portland tomorrow. The address leads to an abandoned department store, according to Google Maps. I've arranged for this document to be automatically sent to several news outlets if I don't check in within 48 hours.

If you're reading this, it either means I'm dead, or I've found something so troubling that I've decided the world needs to know. Either way, if you have twins, or know someone who does, pay attention. Watch for the matchboxes. Don't let them play with matchboxes.

And whatever you do, don't let them out of your sight during Christmas shopping.

[Update - Day 1]

I'm in Portland now, parked across the street from the abandoned department store. It's one of those grand old buildings from the early 1900s, all ornate stonework and huge display windows, now covered with plywood. Holbrook & Sons, according to the faded lettering above the entrance. Something about it seems familiar, though I know I've never been here before.

The weird thing? When I looked up the building's history, I found that it closed in 1952 – the same year the twin disappearances started. The final day of business? December 24th.

I've been watching for three hours now. Twice, I've seen someone enter through a side door – different people each time, but they move the same way. Purposeful. Like they belong there. Like they're going to work.

My phone keeps glitching. The screen flickers whenever I try to take photos of the building. The last three shots came out completely black, even though it's broad daylight. The one before that... I had to delete it. It showed something standing in one of the windows. Something tall and thin that couldn't possibly have been there because all the windows are boarded up.

I found another matchbox on my hood when I came back from getting coffee. Inside was a key and another note: ""Loading dock. Midnight. Bring proof.""

Proof of what?

The sun is setting now. I've got six hours to decide if I'm really going to use that key. Six hours to decide if finding these children is worth risking becoming another disappearance statistic myself. Six hours to wonder what kind of proof they're expecting me to bring.

I keep thinking about something Mrs. Thorne said during one of our later conversations. She'd been looking through old family photos and noticed something odd. In pictures from the months before the twins disappeared, there were subtle changes in their appearance. Their eyes looked different – darker somehow, more hollow. And in the last photo, taken just two days before they vanished, they weren't looking at the camera. Both were staring at something off to the side, something outside the frame. And their expressions...

Mrs. Thorne couldn't finish describing those expressions. She just closed the photo album and asked me to leave.

I found the photo later, buried in the police evidence files. I wish I hadn't. I've seen a lot of frightened children in my line of work, but I've never seen children look afraid like that. It wasn't fear of something immediate, like a threat or a monster. It was the kind of fear that comes from knowing something. Something terrible. Something they couldn't tell anyone.

The same expression I've now found in photographs of other twins, taken days before they disappeared. Always the same hollow eyes. Always looking at something outside the frame.

I've got the key in my hand now. It's old, made of brass, heavy. The kind of key that opens serious locks. The kind of key that opens doors you maybe shouldn't open.

But those children... thirty-six sets of twins over seventy years. Seventy-two children who never got to grow up. Seventy-two families destroyed by Christmas shopping trips that ended in empty car seats and unopened presents.

The sun's almost gone now. The streetlights are coming on, but they seem dimmer than they should be. Or maybe that's just my imagination. Maybe everything about this case has been my imagination. Maybe I'll use that key at midnight and find nothing but an empty building full of dust and old memories.

But I don't think so.

Because I just looked at the last photo I managed to take before my phone started glitching. It's mostly black, but there's something in the darkness. A face. No – two faces. Pressed against one of those boarded-up windows.

They have pale green eyes.

[Update - Day 1, 11:45 PM]

I'm sitting in my car near the loading dock. Every instinct I have is screaming at me to drive away. Fast. But I can't. Not when I'm this close.

Something's happening at the building. Cars have been arriving for the past hour – expensive ones with tinted windows. They park in different locations around the block, never too close to each other. People get out – men and women in dark clothes – and disappear into various entrances. Like they're arriving for some kind of event.

The loading dock is around the back, accessed through an alley. No streetlights back there. Just darkness and the distant sound of the ocean. I've got my flashlight, my gun (for all the good it would do), and the key. And questions. So many questions.

Why here? Why twins? Why age seven? What's the significance of Christmas shopping? And why leave me a key?

The last question bothers me the most. They want me here. This isn't a break in the case – it's an invitation. But why?

11:55 PM now. Almost time. I'm going to leave my phone in the car, hidden, recording everything. If something happens to me, maybe it'll help explain...

Wait.

There's someone standing at the end of the alley. Just standing there. Watching my car. They're too far away to see clearly, but something about their proportions isn't quite right. Too tall. Too thin.

They're holding something. It looks like...

It looks like a matchbox.

Midnight. Time to go.


There was no key. No meeting. I couldn't bring myself to approach that loading dock.

Because at 11:57 PM, I saw something that made me realize I was never meant to enter that building. Not yet. Maybe not ever.

The figure at the end of the alley – the tall, thin one – started walking toward my car. Not the normal kind of walking. Each step was too long, too fluid, like someone had filmed a person walking and removed every other frame. As it got closer, I realized what had bothered me about its proportions. Its arms hung down past its knees. Way past its knees.

I sat there, paralyzed, as it approached my driver's side window. The streetlight behind it made it impossible to see its face, but I could smell something. Sweet, but wrong. Like fruit that's just started to rot.

It pressed something against my window. A matchbox. Inside the matchbox was a polaroid photograph.

I didn't call the police. I couldn't. Because the photo was of me, asleep in my bed, taken last night. In the background, standing in my bedroom doorway, were Kiernan and Brynn Thorne.

I drove. I don't remember deciding to drive, but I drove all night, taking random turns, going nowhere. Just trying to get away from that thing with the long arms, from that photograph, from the implications of what it meant.

The sun's coming up now. I'm parked at a rest stop somewhere in Massachusetts. I've been going through my notes, looking for something I missed. Some detail that might explain what's really happening.

I found something.

Remember those witness accounts I mentioned? The ones about seeing the twins leave with ""their parent""? I've been mapping them. Every single sighting, every location where someone reported seeing missing twins with an unidentifiable adult.

They form a pattern.

Plot them on a map and they make a shape. A perfect spiral, starting in Providence and growing outward across New England. Each incident exactly 27.3 miles from the last.

And if you follow the spiral inward, past Providence, to where it would logically begin?

That department store in Portland.

But here's what's really keeping me awake: if you follow the spiral outward, predicting where the next incident should be...

Hartford. Where those twins just started playing with matchboxes.

I need to make some calls. The families of the missing twins – not just the recent ones, but all of them. Every single case going back to 1952. Because I have a horrible suspicion...

[Update - Day 2, 5:22 PM]

I've spent all day on the phone. What I've found... I don't want it to be true.

Every family. Every single family of missing twins. Three months after their children disappeared, they received a matchbox in the mail. No return address. No note. Just an empty matchbox.

Except they weren't empty.

If you hold them up to the light just right, if you shake them in just the right way, you can hear something inside. Something that sounds like children whispering.

Mrs. Thorne should receive her matchbox in exactly one week.

I called her. Warned her not to open it when it arrives. She asked me why.

I couldn't tell her what the other parents told me. About what happened when they opened their matchboxes. About the dreams that started afterward. Dreams of their children playing in an endless department store, always just around the corner, always just out of sight. Dreams of long-armed figures arranging and rearranging toys on shelves that stretch up into darkness.

Dreams of their children trying to tell them something important. Something about the matchboxes. Something about why they had to play with them.

Something about what's coming to Hartford.

I think I finally understand why twins. Why seven-year-olds. Why Christmas shopping.

It's about innocence. About pairs. About symmetry.

And about breaking all three.

I've booked a hotel room in Hartford. I need to find those twins before they disappear. Before they become part of this pattern that's been spiraling outward for seventy years.

But first, I need to stop at my apartment. Get some clean clothes. Get my good camera. Get my case files.

I know that thing with the long arms might be waiting for me. I know the Thorne twins might be standing in my doorway again.

I'm going anyway.

Because I just realized something else about that spiral pattern. About the distance between incidents.

27.3 miles.

The exact distance light travels in the brief moment between identical twins being born.

The exact distance sound travels in the time it takes to strike a match.

[Update - Day 2, 8:45 PM]

I'm in my apartment. Everything looks normal. Nothing's been disturbed.

Except there's a toy department store catalog from 1952 on my kitchen table. I know it wasn't there this morning.

It's open to the Christmas section. Every child in every photo is a twin.

And they're all looking at something outside the frame.

All holding matchboxes.

All trying to warn us.


[Update - Day 2, 11:17 PM]

The catalog won't let me put it down.

I don't mean that metaphorically. Every time I try to set it aside, my fingers won't release it. Like it needs to be read. Like the pages need to be turned.

It's called ""Holbrook & Sons Christmas Catalog - 1952 Final Edition."" The cover shows the department store as it must have looked in its heyday: gleaming windows, bright lights, families streaming in and out. But something's wrong with the image. The longer I look at it, the more I notice that all the families entering the store have twins. All of them. And all the families leaving... they're missing their children.

The Christmas section starts on page 27. Every photo shows twin children modeling toys, clothes, or playing with holiday gifts. Their faces are blank, emotionless. And in every single photo, there's something in the background. A shadow. A suggestion of something tall and thin, just barely visible at the edge of the frame.

But it's the handwriting that's making my hands shake.

Someone has written notes in the margins. Different handwriting on each page. Different pens, different decades. Like people have been finding this catalog and adding to it for seventy years.

""They're trying to show us something."" (1963)
""The matchboxes are doors."" (1978)
""They only take twins because they need pairs. Everything has to have a pair."" (1991)
""Don't let them complete the spiral."" (2004)
""Hartford is the last point. After Hartford, the circle closes."" (2019)

The most recent note was written just weeks ago: ""When you see yourself in the mirror, look at your reflection's hands.""

I just tried it.

My reflection's hands were holding a matchbox.

I'm driving to Hartford now. I can't wait until morning. Those twins, the ones who just started playing with matchboxes – the Blackwood twins, Emma and Ethan – they live in the West End. Their mother posted about them on a local Facebook group, worried about their new ""obsession"" with matchboxes. Asking if any other parents had noticed similar behavior.

The catalog is on my passenger seat. It keeps falling open to page 52. There's a photo there that I've been avoiding looking at directly. It shows the toy department at Holbrook & Sons. Rows and rows of shelves stretching back into impossible darkness. And standing between those shelves...

I finally made myself look at it properly. Really look at it.

Those aren't mannequins arranging the toys.

[Update - Day 3, 1:33 AM]

I'm parked outside the Blackwood house. All the lights are off except one. Third floor, corner window. I can see shadows moving against the curtains. Small shadows. Child-sized shadows.

They're awake. Playing with matchboxes, probably.

I should go knock on the door. Wake the parents. Warn them.

But I can't stop staring at that window. Because every few minutes, there's another shadow. A much taller shadow. And its arms...

The catalog is open again. Page 73 now. It's an order form for something called a ""Twin's Special Holiday Package."" The description is blank except for one line:

""Every pair needs a keeper.""

The handwritten notes on this page are different. They're all the same message, written over and over in different hands:

""Don't let them take the children to the mirror department.""
""Don't let them take the children to the mirror department.""
""Don't let them take the children to the mirror department.""

The last one is written in fresh ink. Still wet.

My phone just buzzed. A text from an unknown number:
""Check the catalog index for 'Mirror Department - Special Services.'""

I know I shouldn't.

I'm going to anyway.

[Update - Day 3, 1:47 AM]

The index led me to page 127. The Mirror Department.

The photos on this page... they're not from 1952. They can't be. Because one of them shows the Thorne twins. Standing in front of a massive mirror in what looks like an old department store. But their reflection...

Their reflection shows them at different ages. Dozens of versions of them, stretching back into the mirror's depth. All holding matchboxes. All seven years old.

And behind each version, getting closer and closer to the foreground, one of those long-armed figures.

There's movement in the Blackwood house. Adult shapes passing by lit windows. The parents are awake.

But the children's shadows in the third-floor window aren't moving anymore. They're just standing there. Both holding something up to the window.

I don't need my binoculars to know what they're holding.

The catalog just fell open to the last page. There's only one sentence, printed in modern ink:

""The spiral ends where the mirrors begin.""

I can see someone walking up the street toward the house.

They're carrying a mirror.

[Update - Day 3, 2:15 AM]

I did something unforgivable. I let them take the Blackwood twins.

I sat in my car and watched as that thing with the long arms set up its mirror on their front lawn. Watched as the twins came downstairs and walked out their front door, matchboxes in hand. Watched as their parents slept through it all, unaware their children were walking into something ancient and hungry.

But I had to. Because I finally remembered what happened to my brother. What really happened that day at the mall.

And I understood why I became a private investigator.

The catalog is writing itself now. New pages appearing as I watch, filled with photos I took during this investigation. Only I never took these photos. In them, I'm the one being watched. In every crime scene photo, every surveillance shot, there's a reflection of me in a window or a puddle. And in each reflection, I'm standing next to a small boy. 

My twin brother. Still seven years old.

Still holding his matchbox.

[Update - Day 3, 3:33 AM]

I'm parked outside Holbrook & Sons again. The Blackwood twins are in there. I can feel them. Just like I can feel all the others. They're waiting.

The truth was in front of me the whole time. In every reflection, every window, every mirror I've passed in the fifteen years I've been investigating missing children.

We all have reflections. But reflections aren't supposed to remember. They're not supposed to want.

In 1952, something changed in the mirror department at Holbrook & Sons. Something went wrong with the symmetry of things. Reflections began to hunger. They needed pairs to be complete. Perfect pairs. Twins.

But only at age seven. Only when the original and the reflection are still similar enough to switch places.

The long-armed things? They're not kidnappers. They're what happens to reflections that stay in mirrors too long. That stretch themselves trying to reach through the glass. That hunger for the warmth of the real.

I know because I've been helping them. For fifteen years, I've been investigating missing twins, following the spiral pattern, documenting everything.

Only it wasn't me doing the investigating.

It was my reflection.

[Update - Day 3, 4:44 AM]

I'm at the loading dock now. The door is open. Inside, I can hear children playing. Laughing. The sound of matchboxes sliding across glass.

The catalog's final page shows a photo taken today. In it, I'm standing in front of a department store mirror. But my reflection isn't mimicking my movements. It's smiling. Standing next to it is my brother, still seven years old, still wearing the clothes he disappeared in.

He's holding out a matchbox to me.

And now I remember everything.

The day my brother disappeared, we weren't just shopping. We were playing a game with matchboxes. Sliding them back and forth to each other in front of the mirrors in the department store. Each time we slid them, our reflections moved a little differently. Became a little more real.

Until one of us stepped through the mirror.

But here's the thing about mirrors and twins.

When identical twins look at their reflection, how do they know which side of the mirror they're really on?

I've spent fifteen years investigating missing twins. Fifteen years trying to find my brother. Fifteen years helping gather more twins, more pairs, more reflections.

Because the thing in the mirror department at Holbrook & Sons? It's not collecting twins.

It's collecting originals.

Real children. Real warmth. Real life.

To feed all the reflections that have been trapped in mirrors since 1952. To give them what they've always wanted:

A chance to be real.

The door to the mirror department is open now. Inside, I can see them all. Every twin that's disappeared since 1952. All still seven years old. All still playing with their matchboxes.

All waiting to trade places. Just like my brother and I did.

Just like I've been helping other twins do for fifteen years.

Because I'm not August Reed, the private investigator who lost his twin brother in 1992.

I'm August Reed's reflection.

And now that the spiral is complete, now that we have enough pairs...

We can all step through.

All of us.

Every reflection. Every mirror image. Every shadow that's ever hungered to be real.

The matchbox in my hand is the same one my real self gave me in 1992.

Inside, I can hear my brother whispering:

""Your turn to be the reflection.""

[Final Update - Day 3, 5:55 AM]

Some things can only be broken by their exact opposites.

That's what my brother was trying to tell me through the matchbox all these years. Not ""your turn to be the reflection,"" but a warning: ""Don't let them take your turn at reflection.""

The matchboxes aren't tools for switching places. They're weapons. The only weapons that work against reflections. Because inside each one is a moment of perfect symmetry – the brief flare of a match creating identical light and shadow. The exact thing reflections can't replicate.

I know this because I'm not really August Reed's reflection.

I'm August Reed. The real one. The one who's spent fifteen years pretending to be fooled by his own reflection. Investigating disappearances while secretly learning the truth. Getting closer and closer to the center of the spiral.

My reflection thinks it's been manipulating me. Leading me here to complete some grand design. It doesn't understand that every investigation, every documented case, every mile driven was bringing me closer to the one thing it fears:

The moment when all the stolen children strike their matches at once.

[Update - Day 3, 6:27 AM]

I'm in the mirror department now. Every reflection of every twin since 1952 is here, thinking they've won. Thinking they're about to step through their mirrors and take our places.

Behind them, in the darkened store beyond the glass, I can see the real children. All still seven years old, because time moves differently in reflections. All holding their matchboxes. All waiting for the signal.

My reflection is smiling at me, standing next to what it thinks is my brother.

""The spiral is complete,"" it says. ""Time to make every reflection real.""

I smile back.

And I light my match.

The flash reflects off every mirror in the department. Multiplies. Amplifies. Every twin in every reflection strikes their match at the exact same moment. Light bouncing from mirror to mirror, creating a perfect spiral of synchronized flame.

But something goes wrong.

The light isn't perfect. The symmetry isn't complete. The spiral wavers.

I realize too late what's happened. Some of the children have been here too long. Spent too many years as reflections. The mirrors have claimed them so completely that they can't break free.

Including my brother.

[Final Entry - Day 3, Sunrise]

It's over, but victory tastes like ashes.

The mirrors are cracked, their surfaces no longer perfect enough to hold reflections that think and want and hunger. The long-armed things are gone. The spiral is broken.

But we couldn't save them all.

Most of the children were too far gone. Seven decades of living as reflections had made them more mirror than human. When the symmetry broke, they... faded. Became like old photographs, growing dimmer and dimmer until they were just shadows on broken glass.

Only the Thorne twins made it out. Only they were new enough, real enough, to survive the breaking of the mirrors. They're aging now, quickly but safely, their bodies catching up to the years they lost. Soon they'll be back with their mother, with only vague memories of a strange dream about matchboxes and mirrors.

The others... we had to let them go. My brother included. He looked at me one last time before he faded, and I saw peace in his eyes. He knew what his sacrifice meant. Knew that breaking the mirrors would save all the future twins who might have been taken.

The building will be demolished tomorrow. The mirrors will be destroyed properly, safely. The matchboxes will be burned.

But first, I have to tell sixty-nine families that their children aren't coming home. That their twins are neither dead nor alive, but something in between. Caught forever in that strange space between reality and reflection.

Sometimes, in department stores, I catch glimpses of them in the mirrors. Seven-year-olds playing with matchboxes, slowly fading like old polaroids. Still together. Still twins. Still perfect pairs, even if they're only pairs of shadows now.

This will be my last case as a private investigator. I've seen enough reflections for one lifetime.

But every Christmas shopping season, I stand guard at malls and department stores. Watching for long-armed figures. Looking for children playing with matchboxes.

Because the spiral may be broken, but mirrors have long memories.

And somewhere, in the spaces between reflection and reality, seventy years' worth of seven-year-old twins are still playing their matchbox games.

Still waiting.

Still watching.

Just to make sure it never happens again.

They just said let's see about lunch maybe. And 1 pm came around. I haven't eaten anything but a croissant and coffee and I message them straight up. Do you or not wanna hang.

I am writing here because I don't know who to turn to, maybe you could give me some advice.

I am a 33 year old female, and just recently started using dating apps. Around two months ago a matched with a guy. We hit it off, had similar interests and decided to have dinner. I made it clear from the beginning that I wasn't into hookups, ONS or any of that stuff, and he was ok with that, as he wasn't looking for that either. Dinner went great and I was completely captivated by this guy. I thought he was charming, smart and handsome. He was in town only for a few days, and he was leaving the next day. We exchanged numbers, he walked me off to the bus station and waited with me, we said good night and that was it. I really really liked him, but I thought the feeling was mutual, so it was ok, I had no expectations romantically. However it was nice to hangout with him, so a couple of weeks later I texted him, something along the lines of "" Hey, i remembered you would be in town sometime again, and maybe we could catch up"". He replied immediately, and we decided to meet again. We didn't talk again until it was 2 days before his arrival. He confirmed that he was coming, and asked if we still are meeting. I suggested to get dinner the day he was coming, so he could freely plan the rest of his stay. We met for dinner again, and again we had a lovely time. However this time, rather than partying ways after dinner, he suggested we went for a walk, and we went to the Christmas market. He was holding my hand, got me a dessert, and was so caring. After that we had a ride on the ferris wheel and we kissed, and he was holding me the whole time. I was on cloud 7. We both confessed that we like each other since first time we met, however we both had the impression the other person didn't. We wanted to stay longer together, so we ended up walking some more however it was quite late. He suggested we could walk around some more, or we could stay a bit longer together and watch a movie or an anime, as he had a hotel booked for his stay. I hesitated, but he assured me that he didn't imply anything else, just stay together a bit longer, and I agreed. He went to his hotel, talked a little, kissed a little and watched an episode of an anime we both liked. It was past midnight, we were discussing to get me a taxi, although he offered I stayed the night. I couldn't think rationally and I was just happy to be with him, and I couldn;t understand what had gotten into me. I had never done this before, so I wasn't sure about anything, but i just wanted to stay in his hug. The next morning we had breakfast, stayed together a bit longer, walked around and we decided to get to know each other more and see where it goes. He was leaving the next day, however he asked to get some coffee in the morning before leaving. At this point I was sure I really liked him and he really liked me. So the next morning before parting, we decided we will be in touch, get to know each other more and meet again next time he was in town ( which would be in a month or so). For the next two weeks we kept in touch and chitchatted almost every day. I think this is where I messed up. Before leaving he had mentioned something along the lines of "" his past relationships had messed him up, and he never actually got attention from his ex, it was mostly psychological abuse from her"". I thought it would be cute to text him "" good morning"", as a sign of ' hey I wish you a good day, and I want to make an effort cos I like you"". I had asked him before if that was ok, and he said it was actually cute. So I would hit him with some text randomly, either sharing a funny situation, or the first snow, or just random stuff. We also decided to have a virtual date once a week (I'm mentioning this, as when we had coffee, he was the one who suggested we could play some game, like LOL, so we could have some fun activity together). One day, around two weeks later, abruptly, he texted saying that he doesn't like the idea of a weekly call, as it feels something you would do in a relationship. He also said that things to be going in different directions as he is more of a 'collect-data-first' kind of person, whereas I seem to be setting for a long term relationship. I was so taken aback. and I couldn't think of anything. I can;t even remember what I said exactly, but I realized no matter what I said, he had decided to end things ( whatever the thing we had was). I thanked him for his honesty and wished him the best and that was it.

It has been a little more than month and I still cannot forget what happened. I hate to admit it, but I still like him and I feel I blew things by texting him that often, as I might have overwhelmed him, although my intention was to simply show that I was willing to make an effort. Is there any change I could fix things, and if yes, what should I do?

Merry Krismas. :D I want to thank anyone's who read my various one shot fanfics over the years here on the Krusie Gang.  I know that's probably not many of you but to those, thank you!  This is a sort of conclusion to the various one shot fanfics and plot threads I've given over the years.  Don't worry, you won't have to go back to make sense of it.  To give some background, this takes place after a possible ending of Deltarune--the Roaring and Titans were  stopped but at a price.  The Dark Worlds were sealed, including Castle Town.  Rudy Holiday passed away, sacrificing himself but December Holiday lived.  The world goes on.  But some hurts go deep and one Kris Dreemurr, the experience of having his very world controlled for so long hit deep.  Only one can really help him now....

\--

Kris and Susie came up to the Holidays' gate and sighed...this would be the first time they'd be apart for the next two weeks.  The human had agreed to stay with the Holidays for Christmas and New Years, the first time in ages as Dess was back but Rudy had unfortunately met his end during the Roaring.  Noelle and Dess thought having Kris around would be good while Asriel wanted to get to know Susie better so Tori put in for a two week cruise with help from Carol on that front pitching in funds.  The two families were working to mend fences and try to start things anew but not everything was hunky dory.  Kris and Dess hadn't seen each other in months since the Roaring.

There was still some unspoken trauma that had to be taken care of.

Susie looked at Kris, frowning.  Last year at Thanksgiving, she and Noelle had found out about Kris cutting himself.  Noelle, not one to keep anything to herself, told Dess upon her unnatural return to life.  Dess was not surprised, knowing Kris.  When they reunited, Kris couldn't help but embrace Dess in relief, apologizing endlessly and all Dess could do was sit there and let Kris cry into her chest.  The two battled together and won the day but ever since then, hadn't seen each other.  Kris has kept to themselves, the guilt of what happened all those years ago still biting at him.  Dess decided to let Kris come to her instead of forcing the issue but decided a year had been long enough.  They weren't getting any younger, after all.

""You sure you're gonna be ok, dude? I can get your Mom to walk you to...""Susie began.

""No, I need to do this.  Dess is right...I've been away for long enough."" Kris formed a small smile, Susie being the only connection he's had to the real world for months.

""All right, you know I got your back."" Susie hugged Kris, Kris hugging her back. ""Just don't drink all the Eggnog...save me some for a change, ya goober!!""

""It'll go bad by the time you're back."" Kris crossed his arms, annoyed at the request.

""But that's when it's best!"" Susie raised her arms. ""Sides', those expiration dates are just suggestions.""

""Damn straight...I drink expired milk all the time.""

Kris and Susie turned their heads, December Holiday in a Green Day shirt, jeans and bat straddled on her left shoulder.

""Hey there...Krismas."" Dess whispered, a look of genuine affection coming from the deer as she pushed the gate open. ""Better late than never, huh?""

""Y-Yeah...""Kris managed to blurt out, stiff as a statue as Dess walked up to him with that bat.  Susie backed off, not wanting to get anywhere near that piece of baseball history.  Traitor, Kris thought.  What did he do now?!

""Never too late for ruining poor Elly's snow angel, eh?"" Dess slammed her bat into her free hand.

""That was over ten years ago!!"" Kris stammered.

""Do the crime, pay the overdue time!"" Dess more than overshadowed Kris as she was nearly twice his height at this point.

Kris closed his eyes in fear, Dess giggling and merely picked Kris up into an overdue hug.

""But first, cuddles are in order!!!"" December laughed, embracing Kris tight bringing his head down upon her fuzzy shoulder, her furry arms warming Kris on this cold December Christmas Eve.

""Dess, don't maul him!!"" Noelle yelled from the house, laughing.

""Sorry Krismas."" December gave him a deer lick to the face, Kris feeling waves of overdue warmth run throughout his meek human frame. ""But I'm gonna be invading your personal space for the next two weeks, kay?""

""K-k."" Kris blushed, Susie laughing on the ground in the background.

""Just don't slobber him too much."" Susie got up, wiping a tear of laughter from her eye.

""Oh no guarantees on that.  IM me those pics of the ocean when you get to the port!"" Dess said. ""I am so overdue for going cruising!""

""You got it."" Susie smiled, her and Dess having become good friends while Kris had been isolated in the house for the past year.

""See ya...Kris, be good...all right?"" Susie smiled, the smile only Kris had seen from her that first time they survived the Dark World together.  Despite everything, Kris hadn't gained the courage to tell her.  She knew that he cherished her but never actually got to really...tell her how she felt.  Noelle could see it and out of respect for their friendship, decided to keep her distance...romance wise.  She was just glad to have Kris back and talked to Kris over the internet.

""C'mon Krismas!!!""Dess slung Kris over her shoulder, Kris hanging like a sack of potatoes not saying anything.

===

Back inside the Holiday's estate, Dess put Kris down but not before nuzzling the heck outta his neck, making him squirm getting a giggle out of Noelle who greeted Kris with an overdue hug of her own.  Kris appreciated the attention, happy knowing that he was still loved by the two of them and that he was missed despite all they had been through over the years.

""Well, at least you're keeping clean."" Noelle straightened his hair, noticing he'd cut it off via a buzz cut so that his eyes were now visible. ""Wow you feel soft on the top!!""

""Thanks."" Kris smirked, Noelle genuinely curious at Kris' new look.

""It's good on ya, Krismas!"" Dess put a hand on his shoulder, Kris blushing at the contact.  It really was good to be around Dess once again.  She wasn't just a voice in his head anymore...she was right here, teasing him and getting in his personal space(not that he minded).

""Got it last night from Mom--decided it was time people saw me for me."" Kris felt his hair. ""And not just some...creepy kid.""

""Hey."" Dess bent down on her knees. ""We've both been through a lot and I can't begin to know what Gaster put you through. That's over now.  We'll have plenty of time to talk things through but for now...it's still early and we don't really celebrate until tonight.  We can take a nap together and just chill, all right?""

""S-Sounds good."" Kris admitted.  When they were little, Dess would let Kris or Noelle(Noelle especially) sleep with her if they were having trouble or were scared.  Kris was kinda of a special case because he didn't like to admit to being scared but would do so when Dess probed him enough.

""All right."" Dess took Kris' hand, smiling at the young human.

""Just a moment!""

Carol Holiday, the mayor of Hometown came out from the kitchen, having finished her first morning coffee with a hint of peppermint.  It was a necessity for getting through her long days of running the town.  She'd especially need it today with what she was about to lay upon the human staying in her home.  There was a tense feeling in the room, not one of warmth but of unresolved feelings and unfortunately for Kris, they were not good ones.

""Welcome back, young Dreemurr.  If you don't mind, a moment of your time in my office please.""

""Mom, we discussed this! Kris isn't ready for your--""

""Dess, stay out of this."" Carol interjected. ""I've had quite enough of your rebellious remarks this week and I want a peaceful Christmas Eve so please just let me talk to the boy.""

""I'll give you rebellious you--""Dess began to walk up to her mother.

""Dess!"" Noelle got in the middle of them. ""P-Please, don't...just let her talk to Kris.""

Kris was suddenly not feeling very welcome, beginning to look towards the door.  Dess noticed this and got enraged as she had just gotten to get Kris comfortable.

""In here, please."" Carol mentioned to Kris, walking into her office without so much as looking at Kris.  Kris obeyed, walking into the office and shutting the door behind them.

Carol sat at her desk, decorated in various pictures of her family, especially Rudy who she wanted Kris to see.  Kris sat down at one of the guest seats at the mayor's insistence, Kris looking at the family photos--various pictures of the Holidays and Dreemurrs together, none with him in there.  Seems Carol didn't really like reminders of his presence.

""I'm going to make this brief and then you can go back to the people who love you out there.  As you can tell, there is no love in this room for you...not from me.  As far as I'm concerned, you and my daughter brought this plague upon our town.  My daughter I can forgive but you...not so much.  When Toriel adopted you, I told her there would be nothing but trouble.  She was offended at the very notion and now here we are...one less husband and a town recovering from a nearly world ending event.  I am grateful for what you and your friends did to correct the situation.  You were dealt a terrible problem but Kristopher...you have to know, I am only tolerating your presence here because my husband would want me to.  My daughters love you, to an unhealthy degree and I will not deny them.  However, December has put off her college because of her concern for your well being.  These next two weeks...do NOT make me regret agreeing to this...understand?""

Kris was silent at first and then slowly nodded, feeling as he'd been given the worst talking to ever...like he was a criminal being given clemency.  Feeling the urge to cry, Kris slowly got up and ran out the door, slamming it behind him.  Carol sat in her chair, sighing.

Kris came out, leaning against a wall and sliding down into a sitting position, sniffing and finding it hard NOT to break down.  Dess immediately came to him, putting both hands on his shoulders.

""Shhh....it's all right.  Whatever she said, we'll make things right, ok?"" Dess nuzzled him.

""Yeah Krismas, we'll be here for you."" Noelle knelt beside him.

""(I-I want to go home...)""Kris cried, burying his head in his hands.""(I thought I could do this but I'm trouble no matter where I go.)""

Dess and Noelle looked at each other.  He was happy! But she just had to trample all over their Krismas.

""Noelle, take Krismas up to my bed, all right? Try and calm him down for me.""

""I-I'll just go back...""

""No Krismas."" Dess reassured him. ""You're WELCOME here, even if my Mom doesn't think so.  Please, I'll be up soon.""

""O-Ok."" Kris sniffed, Noelle putting an arm around him helping him up the stairs.

===

""Just WHAT the hell was that, back there?!"" December walked into Carol's office, making sure the door knob slammed into the wall.

""I told you I'd make sure Kris knew the ground rules.  We discussed this, dear."" Carol said calmly, sipping her second steamy coffee.

""No, you just regressed his mood back a FULL YEAR, you witch!"" The doe clenched her hard tipped fingers into fists, enraged at her mother. ""Do you know how long we've been working to get him outta that house of his...how long we've talked him into this! Kris wouldn't see me because he thought I didn't want to see him!""

""Witch? Oh dear, that's wholly original on your part.  Please, do let me know your true feelings."" Carol rolled her eyes, going back to her papers.

""Are you even listening?"" Dess laid her hands on her desk.

""Why should I? You don't listen to me.  You've put off your life for this human's.  Get off my case.""

""The HUMAN who helped saved your precious town, you hypocrite!  The HUMAN who had to witness me fall into an endless void in that stupid bunker and laid the fault upon himself for years when it wasn't his.""

""But it is and yours on top of that.  You are still in this house because your father wanted me to take care of you and so I honor his last wishes.  But don't for a minute think I'm gonna tolerate your sass.  I have my limits and I can make your life hell while still honoring his words.  So hear me Dess, don't TEST ME."" Carol stood up. ""You THINK I wanted any of this?! We're dealt the cards we're given and we have to deal with them as best as we can.  Now, get back to wasting your time and leave me in peace.  I'm working trying to salvage Noelle's educational opportunities since unlike you...she has a future.""

Dess simply walked out, slamming the door behind her. Carol noted the damaged wall left behind by the door knob.  That would be the fifth time Dess had slammed the door in like that.  Just adding to the list of things she'd have to fix.  Oh well, next item on the agenda.

====

Kris looked up at the ceiling of Dess' room, it decorated in Christmas lights and glow in the dark sticky stars.  She was a big fan of those growing up and couldn't believe they still glew in the dark despite being almost twenty years old now just sticking up there.  Noelle lay beside Krismas, looking at them and just reveling in their simplicity.  Kris sighed, wondering where Dess was.

""Hey, sorry for the wait."" Dess sighed, closing the door gently behind her.

""It was worth it."" Kris responded with a small smile.

""That's good to hear."" December lay beside him, immediately bringing Kris into her arms and hugging him like a stuffed plush and laying her head atop his. ""Kris, what my Mom said about this being your fault and mine--don't listen to her garbage.  She's going through a lot.""

""I miss him too."" Kris said, rubbing his head into her fuzzy exposed shoulder. ""He had a good sense of humor.""

""Yeah, like that time you fell into our Christmas lights trying to bath bomb our toilet."" December sighed, remembering the plumbing bill she had to work weeks to pay off.

""I'll let you two catch up."" Noelle smiled, kissing Kris on the forehead and patting him as if to tell him it'd be all right. ""Like Dess said, it's good to have you back Krismas.""

Noelle quietly left the room, Dess making sure she was gone before she resumed talking to Kris again.

""So...you still hear them in your thoughts?"" Dess asked. ""The...player?""

""Sometimes...what they did was messed up but in the end, they did the right thing."" Kris said. ""They...let me go.""

""Dr. Gaster was always sure that whomever was driving that heart of yours would do the right thing but at the same time, the wrong thing."" Dess said. ""That is kinda messed up.""

""Y-Yeah..."" Kris trembled, just thinking about it.

""H-Hey, don't worry Krismas...let's talk about something else."" Dess changed subjects on the fly. ""Oh hey...I've been talking to Susie a lot!  I gotta say Krismas...you got lucky with this one.  I can see why you and Noelle fell for her.  But hey, why not just admit your feelings?""

""I-It's not that simple..."" Kris said.

""Heyy, I get it.  I went through the same thing with Azzy.  How is he, anyways?"" Dess asked.

""Off doing his own thing with Mom and Susie then back to college."" Kris said. ""We actually haven't talked much since the end of this whole...thing.""

""That's Azzy for ya.  Always was in his own world.  Probably chasing his own version of Susie, I imagine."" Dess rolled her eyes, thinking of her own missed opportunities. ""You wouldn't be available, would ya Krismas?""

""W-W-Wha...""Kris blushed.

""I'm 22 and you're 19 now.  We could totally hook up."" Dess hugged Kris close. ""And it would piss my Mom off too.""

The very thought WAS appealing to Kris but Susie...

""I'm just messing with you, Krismas."" December kissed his forehead. ""You already got my heart so consider me an official third wheel in your life.""

""I--I have, in a good way for a long time."" Kris blushed. ""I don't know what I'd be without you to be honest...well, you and Susie for the most part.""

""Well, me and Susie have talked about it and were wondering...when you're ready, of course...if you'd consider getting an apartment together? We'd split the rent and grow old together."" Dess said. ""Given what we've gone through and our...connection...I can't imagine life without you, Krismas.  Remember those days when you'd play the piano out of the blue like you were remembering something.  I heard those through our soul connection...it helped keep me sane while working as Gaster's assistant.""

""It felt like you were there playing your guitar."" Kris whispered. ""I...missed playing with you.""

""Me too, me too."" Dess hugged him close, sighing in content. ""God I wish we could just stay like this forever.""

""Let's just pretend forever is a few hours then."" Kris began to fall asleep, Dess' hair in Kris' face. ""About your question--I--""

""Just think about it, Krismas..."" Dess yawned, getting comfortable.  It was good to genuinely fall asleep for once...for both of them.

\---

Noelle made her way downstairs, sighing to herself.  A lot had happened in the last hour or so but she wanted to make sure Krismas felt welcome in their home but her Mom had to make it all the more difficult, of course.

""I guess, in the end...we all made a mess of things huh Krismas."" Noelle whispered to herself.  She wished things could just go back to before they were.

A ring at the doorbell? Guess they were getting all sorts of visitors today.

""Welcome to the Holidays!"" Noelle opened the door, putting on her best smile.""S-SUSIE?""

""Sup.  Decided to join you guys instead...Azzy kinda stinks anyway."" Susie smirked. ""Where's the slobbering duo?""

""In bed."" Noelle put a finger to her mouth, indicating silence. ""They're just getting to sleep.""

""I see the riff raff have come out of the woodwork indeed."" Carol opened the door to her office. ""I didn't approve of this...one, Noelle.""

""Fuck off lady!"" Susie gave her the finger. ""You might be mayor but you can take that stick up your ass and shove it further because quite frankly, I don't give a shit.  Noelle and Dess want me here.""

""OUT."" Carol pointed to the door.

""MOM!!"" Noelle shouted, stomping her hoof down on the floor. ""That's enough!! You've treated my friends as nothing but scum for long enough.  You haven't even given Susie a proper chance!""

""She had all the chances society gave her.  Your father's clemency only goes so far and it does not extend to...THAT.""

""C'mon lady, just give me an excuse."" Susie began to clench her fists.

""Yes, assault would go fine on your soon-to-be criminal record."" Carol smirked with self confidence. ""Not to mention breaking and entering.""

Susie spit on the floor, Noelle gasping.

""Intended damage to property.  Guess the list is just growing, huh?"" Susie shot back.

""The police is on speed dial.  Just TRY ME."" Carol held up her cell phone.

""Enough, enough!!"" Noelle whistled. ""Intervention...NOW.""

""Inter..vention?"" Susie and Carol both blurted out.

""YES. Sit down, BOTH OF YOU."" Noelle gained a burst of confidence all of a sudden.

""Noelle Holiday, I...""

""NOW!"" Noelle shouted, Susie immediately obeying as if Tori was saying it.  A little taken aback and put off by her sudden air of authority, she acquiesced and sat down on the sofa.

""Susie, if you would...please bring out some cookies and cocoa.  They're already prepped in the kitchen.""

\---

Upstairs, Dess became annoyed with all the noise downstairs as did Kris who woke up buried in December's black head fur.

""D-Don't...suppose they'll shut up anytime soon...""

""Nope."" Dess responded, sighing. ""And here we got like...five minutes?""

""Well, let's try and go back to sleep."" Kris sighed, trying to get comfortable again.

""Not...quite yet."" An idea came to Dess suddenly. ""Lay on your back and close your eyes.""

""What're you...""Kris began.

""Quiet, nothing bad."" Dess winked.

""Okay, fine I'll play along."" Kris sighed too tired to care anyway.

Grinning, Dess got on her knees quickly pulling down her pants and sitting her fuzzy behind on Kris' face.

""FOR ELLY!!"" December grunted.

\*FRRRRTTT\*

Dess Holiday let off the biggest fart she could give, avenging Elly's snow angel from years ago. Kris struggled underneath December's fuzzy rear, Dess quickly letting off another one before letting him go and pushing up her pants, laughing hysterically on the bed as Kris gagged and coughed red in the face from the sheer unexpected nature.

""That's for ruining Elly's angels!!"" Dess slapped Kris in the back.

""Oooooooohh I'm so getting you back."" Kris narrowed his eyes.""\*coughcough\*...geez Dess...""

""What, you want more?"" Dess narrowed her eyes.

""No no...no revenge plan, we're even!"" Kris waved his arms, laying back down on his side in defeat.

""C'mere..."" Dess sighed, hugging him close despite the smell she left behind. ""I'm sorry I had to do that.  But I've wanted to do that for years.""

""Well played."" Kris replied, feeling Dess begin to lick him again as if to soothe troubled waters.

""Noelle will love this!!"" Dess laughed, laying her head on the top of Kris' again.

""Haha, so glad I could entertain...youuu.""Kris felt himself lose consciousness.  What was...

""K-Kris?"" Dess grabbed him. ""KRIS?! This better not be--KRIS?!""

\-----

""These are delightful."" Carol acknowledged Noelle's cooking. ""You're coming up well, darling.""

""T-Thank you."" Noelle smiled a bit, surprised at the acknowledgement.

""Hells yeah, I'll agree with this!!"" Susie ate ten cookies in one bite. ""This and the cocoa..DAMN.""

""Language."" Carol hissed.

""I told you lady...""

""Susie, you're not helping!"" Noelle hissed as well.

""F-Fine."" Susie grumbled, eating another cookie.

""Now look, we have to learn to get along here.  The way you've been acting if unacceptable Mom.  I know Dad's passing has hurt you but you need to acknowledge that hurt and not let it loose upon others.  Kris didn't kill Rudy...Rudy blocked an attack from a Titan rather than let the cancer take him.  He went out on his own terms, Mom.""

""I am not...""

""Yes, you are."" Susie looked at Noelle's Mom. ""What, you never put on a mask before? I did the same thing to Kris not too long ago.  I bullied the shit outta that kid. He never fought back.  Don't know why...probably woulda respected him more for it but that's not his nature.  Kris...is too good for your bullshit.  He takes punishment rather than dishes it.  I...didn't know what he was going through until it was nearly too late.  Kris risked his life for mine.  He did the same for everyone and everyone in Hometown is wondering where he is most of the time and how he's doing.  You're the only one who seems to genuinely despise him.""

""I don't despise Kris, I...tolerate him."" Carol sipped her tea and brushed her short blonde hair.

""Out of respect for your now dead husband.  Yeah, I get it."" Susie chided. ""So Kris isn't good enough for your vaunted Hometown?""

""Well, no it's just...""

""MOM MOM!"" Dess came running down the stairs crying. ""There's something wrong with Kris...I don't know...""

""D-Dess--"" Kris came to in the young doe's arms, albeit a little dizzy. ""I-It's all right...I just got a familiar...feeling.""

""Was this because I farted on you?"" Dess exclaimed, glad Kris was all right.

""You did what?!"" Carol stood up, Susie and Noelle snickering at the mention knowing what she was talking about.

""N-No...I felt...them.  Gaster and someone...else.""

""Who?"" Dess closed her eyes, beginning to feel them as well.

""Not sure but they are vaguely familiar."" Kris grabbed their head, in slight pain as Dess put him down reluctantly but staying close to him. ""Not in a good way.""

""Are they coming to this home?"" Carol stood up.

""Y-Yeah...right now?""

With that, a knock came at the door.  Noelle got up, opening the door to see who it was.

\---

""Well um...this was unexpected."" Dess raised an eye though Kris backed up, somehow knowing subconsciously what was coming.

""I hope we are not intruding."" The skeletal figure bowed as Ralsei waved a friendly hello in the background.

""DUDE, how are you...""Susie began.

""I'm afraid we have little time for explanations Susie but to be blunt...the Doctor made it so.""Ralsei motioned towards Dr. Gaster who took another bow.

""Wow, good for you.  Now what do you want?"" Dess and Susie came to Kris' side, protecting him.

""We are here because we need you two...ie the elder Holiday and young Dreemurr."" Dr. Gaster acknowledged. ""The temporary stop gap we put in place to keep this reality from falling apart is coming loose.  We need a sufficient power source in order to solidify the gap and keep your universe in place.""

""Why does it always come back to the two of us? Haven't you done enough?"" Dess stepped up to the skeleton man.

""December..."" Ralsei began.

""NO, Ralsei.  You, of all people, should know what this monster does to people!"" Dess gave the doctor a death stare. ""We cannot just go along with what he wants.""

""I'm afraid...you do.  We have ten minutes, at most.  We held off contacting you for the longest time possible but we have no other choice now.  We HAVE to do this."" Ralsei explained. ""Or the Titans really will have won.""

""What, that seal we made with all our souls combined isn't enough?"" Kris inquired from behind Dess.

""The Titans punched a hole in reality as a last shot gambit.  That should've ended everything but some quick thinking on all your parts prevented calamity.  We never foresaw that happening in the various alternate reality scenarios we played."" Ralsei explained. ""Like your dream of Kris dying Susie.""

""That WASN'T cool, man."" Susie grumbled, still fuming over knowing how many times she went through this.

""It was science."" Gaster implored. ""But what say you?""

""I say leave it to the kids.  They have obviously demonstrated an ability to make decisions we were too weak or unwilling to do so long ago."" Carol admitted, walking up to the vulnerable Kris leaning down to him.  Carol looked at Kris, a crack in her armor appearing.  Kris was visibly confused at what was happening but then realized what the mayor was trying to convey at long last.

""I...am sorry."" Carol gently wrapped her arms around the boy. ""I know this means little coming from me but I am genuinely sorry for how I have acted.  I...wanted to say that to you earlier but I just didn't have the courage.  My rage blinded my intent and for that, I'm sorry.  Please, if this is the last thing I ever say to you--you were worth every penny.""

Kris returned the hug with warm feelings, wishing his last hug from a Mom would've come from his own but that would have to do.

""Oh Mom..."" Dess smiled.

""I'll do it."" Kris stood up, coming out from behind Carol. ""I'm--tired of letting my guilt own me.  I want to protect the world that gave me Susie...that gave me Dess.""

""OH Krismas!"" Dess hugged Kris from behind, wrapping her arms around him. ""I love you too...hell, I'll do it.""

""Perfect.  The soul combination has proven effective in the past.  Working on a consistent basis, we can keep the stop gap in place for an extended period of time remotely while working on a more permanent solution.  We will in the meantime preserve your bodies in a broken form and then reform them with your souls intact once their use has ended and the more permanent hole in reality is sealed."" The Doctor explained. ""If you two will get on the bed please.""

""T-The bed?"" Kris questioned as Ralsei snapped his fingers, a replica of December Holiday's bed appearing.

""You remarked earlier that you wanted to stay like that forever, right?"" Ralsei asked. ""Just think of it as our way of granting that wish.  It'll be the most painless and effective way to undergo the procedure we're asking of you.""

""Will we be conscious at all?"" Dess asked.

""...""Ralsei grimaced.

""Out with it."" Kris demanded.

""Very little.  Just enough to know that you both still exist.""

""Then it'll have to be good enough."" Dess sighed, taking a hold of Kris' hand. ""Hey...you ready?""

""For oblivion? Hell yeah."" Kris grinned in defiance like he used to.

""There's the gremlin I know."" Dess grinned back, ready to hop on to the bed.

""Wait!"" Susie and Noelle jumped up, coming to the two of them, Noelle looking at December and Susie at Kris.

""Hey, I know I told you I don't do hugs (that one time don't count) but uhhhh...oh shit."" Susie grabbed Kris, locking him into a giant dragon girl embrace. ""Dude, thank you for everything.  I don't know where I'd be today without you. \*sniff\* I--dammit Kris I don't want to let go...""

Kris didn't say anything, just letting Susie's embrace take ahold for as long as possible.  He wanted to say it.  He so wanted to admit his feelings, seeing Noelle out of the corner of his eye.  Despite the friction Susie caused them in their relationship, Kris could only blurt out...

""I'll miss you...a lot Susie."" Kris admitted, tears running down his face grappling on to her back and not wanting to let go.  The two of them shook and grew weak in their hug, knowing what was coming.  Noelle and Dess looked at the two of them, as did Carol as the two dropped to their knees hugging and crying.  Dr. Gaster felt a twinge of sympathy for the two of them,  knowing what he had put them through.  Ralsei merely looked away, feeling as if he didn't deserve to witness this...

He felt like scum.

""Hey."" Kris whispered to Ralsei.

""W-Kris?""Ralsei asked.

""Come on, this'll be the last time you'll be able to do this.""

""Yeah, toothpaste boy."" Susie grinned meekly, tears in her eyes.

The three of them embraced for a final time, Ralsei not knowing what to say.

""Dess...""Noelle hugged her sister tight, that same steel embrace Kris gave Dess earlier making itself known.

""Oh Noelle, look at you.  My little Elly's grown up and is becoming a woman."" December ran her hand through her hair. ""Just know that I'm proud of you...always so proud of you.  I can't wait to see you again.""

""I--I won't make the mistake of asking when."" Noelle looked up, tears musing up her fur. ""December...please.""

""You called me December...haha."" Dess wiped a tear away. ""Been a long time since you called me that...fahaha.""

""Please...protect Kris."" Noelle looked over at him.

""I will, just like I watched over you both."" Dess said. ""Kris...just needs it more right now.""

With reluctance, the two little groups broke apart and Kris and Dess lay on the bed on their sides, looking at one another grinning yet in a somber tone.  Noelle came to the side of the bed, looking at Kris from Dess' side nodding in approval quickly before it was too late.

""A-Are you...sure...""

""Y-Yes...it's all right.""

Susie was confused, not sure what was going when Kris looked over, tears in his eyes.  He gulped, Dess nudging him with her head and with a burst of determination...

""I love you.""

Kris and Dess hugged tight, closing their eyes as if in an instant, the bed itself disappeared and was sucked into an orb, now radiating with red energy, the orb smoking in Ralsei's hand.  Susie dropped to her knees again, feeling all too weak at the words.  Noelle came to her side, seeing if she was all right.

""Noelle, did you know...how he felt?"" Susie whispered, looking down as her hair hid her eyes from view once again.

""Y-Yes...and I felt the same way."" Noelle admitted. ""I stayed back...out of respect, as did Kris.  I didn't want Kris to leave without the opportunity to admit to you how he felt...I'm sorry.""

""Don't be sorry."" Susie sniffed, the two hugging. ""Don't ever be sorry...for how you really feel.""

The Doctor bowed, walking out orb in hand, Ralsei not far behind them.

""Ralsei!"" Susie got up. ""Will we...see you again?""

""Most unlikely."" Ralsei said, arms behind his back. ""But thanks for the hug...I...I needed that, more than you know even if I don't deserve you.""

A tear ran down Ralsei's face, Gaster gently placing a comforting hand on his shoulder.

With that, the two of them were gone.  Susie sat down on the nearest sofa, trying to process what just happened.  Noelle walked up beside her, bending down on her knees.

""So...what now?"" Noelle asked.

""So? I wait until he gets back and I return the favor."" Susie smiled genuinely, her eyes visible again. ""So...you lot still up for Christmas?""

***10******^(th)*** ***sept 2024***

HBA1C- 5.9, FBS- 118, 2 hours PPBS- 107

Grade 1 fatty liver with elevated SPGT and SGOT, elevated cholesterol levels

***23******^(rd)*** ***Dec 2024-***

HBA1C- 5.5, FBS- 106, 2 hours PPBS- 120

No Fatty liver and all bloodwork results are normal

I knew I am at a higher risk of getting diabetes as it runs in my family, but when the results came in sept’24, I couldn’t believe the result. Since from years I kept myself within normal BMI limit and avoided all sugary and Junk food but had them only on special occasions. I was disappointed and accepted that genetics is something that is not in my control. Doctor prescribed me metformin immediately which I chose not to take. I joined a few forums like this one, read about success stories and understood the mistakes I was making.

I was a heavy consumer of white rice. I believed that physical exercise was key to maintaining a healthy life rather than focusing on food as rice was main staple food for many generations for us. My grandfathers worked on farms, ate carb heavy meals with rice 3 times a day but were super fit and lived for more than 95 years with no health complications at all. But with my current lifestyle of having a desk job and hitting the gym only once a week, I realized consuming carb heavy meals is not ideal.

**Diet changes**:

1.     Breakfast is eggs (3-4) with feta cheese or boiled lentils with tea

2.     Steamed veggies (peas, carrots, beans, broccoli), chicken, a small portion of quinoa and lots of yogurt

3.     Tea/Coffee with a small amount of sugar

4.     Dinner- steamed veggies, quinoa, grilled or air-fried chicken/fish, boiled chickpeas/red kidney beans

I always eat vegetables first, followed by meat, and then grains/carbs

**Work out**: I purchased kettle bells (20,15,10,5 lbs.) and asked ChatGPT to provide me an exercise routine targeting body fat reduction, muscle building and burn 500 calories. I followed the same workout routine for a minimum of 5 days a week. I also made sure to walk, if not outdoors, indoors for 15 mins post every meal.

I lost weight from 85 kgs to 74 kgs in 2 months. I made a lot of changes to my lifestyle, which was very overwhelming initially, especially with the diet. But I drew inspiration from athletes who eat the same food for years to be at the top of their game. If they can do it for their career, success, money, fame and recognition, I thought I could do it for a far better reason i.e., for my Health and wellbeing. The routine became a habit now with no carvings for sugar or junk food. Bonus points are that even my wife started eating healthy food and working out with me now.

I know I am not out of the woods yet, as this is a long-term game, and I hope to further improve and make this permanent. My next focus is my sleep cycle, which is disrupted due to work and kids. However, I feel my overall health has improved because these changes I made in the last 3 months; I don’t have fatty liver condition anymore, and all the bloodwork’s are normal now.

I gained a lot of insights from detailed discussions in the thread and am sharing my journey for anyone who can benefit from it. I would also like to hear from you on any additional improvements I could make to better myself.",2,1735076674.0,prediabetes,1,1.0,False

I get a call this morning from my brothers that presents are being done at my brothers this afternoon around 12, and that I should come over around that time. 
I am honestly terrible at procrastination and I have decided to give all the kids a 20 dollar bill a piece, along with his husbands sister. My brother and his husband got a hundo collectively. I also figure this way, they’ll be able to go to the store and buy what they want because kids get excited about spending their own money and I’ll be the “cool aunt” that gives them the money this year lol. 

So, as of course you can guess from the headline, we all sit in the living room and everyone opens gifts. I sit there drinking coffee watching everyone, even my brother’s husbands sister got several gifts from them and she got things for everyone else as well. 
The more I sat there, the more the smile just kind of dwindled off my face. It’s not about the materialistic things at all, please understand. I’ve never had anything growing up. It’s not about how much I gave them and about how much they got from everyone else. I just kind of felt, left out in a sense. Like, they usually get the kids to each get me a cheesy gift every year which is adorable and cute, but the kids got his husbands sister something but I didn’t this time. It’s usually just a one gift kind of event for me which I’m absolutely okay with but it makes me just feel good that they even thought of me. 
I just kind of even wondered why they even told me to come over. 
It really makes me feel guilty because I feel ungrateful, but also my feelings are kind of hurt because it’s the only family I have here and I don’t celebrate Christmas with anyone else.

Where I use straw to drink my coffee because this way I won't see my reflection on it.

Where I don't have anyone to talk to so that I can forget my own voice.

I'm gonna spend my time reading books, studying,  watching anime, reading manga and laying on my queen size bed. Tbh, I always liked to spend my time alone. Where I don't have to perceive myself through another person. I'm just laying there with my black cat.

Now I'm convinced. Despite my craving for human relationships. It's just not for me. I'm gonna deal with it like I have some kind of lactose intolerance but for people xD. Enough of trying to express myself and mess up in the end. Enough of being a problem to others. Enough of ruining other people lives. Enough of having conversations with others that end up with them cursing me and my opinions. I'm not for that. I'm the problem but it's not a bad thing if there is nobody to be a problem to 🤝.

as i'm sure we're all aware, ZZZ is a game that does a really good job when it comes to it's cast and world. while the world of ZZZ isn't as big as something like genshin or HSR, it instead takes advantage of it's smaller size by really fleshing out all of the smaller details, making the world feel alive and like it's actually breathing. and to make this world feel even more interactive and alive, i'm pitching an idea that's been in the back of my mind for the last couple of days. shopkeeper trust events.

you know how inky the stray cat has trust events, and how you can actually rank up it's trust? i'm pitching similar events for the shopkeepers of ZZZ. these events would apply to all of the ones that actively sell you things, like general chop, elfy, susie, tinmaster, etc. though i think if you really wanted, you could even include people like enzo, howl, asha, and more.

basically, these work like ordinary trust events. every now and again when visiting a shop, you'll have a chance for a trust event where you can chat with or interact with the shopkeepers. obviously picking the right answers awards more trust, you get the idea.

trust rank up events could maybe involve running errands for the shopkeepers. maybe getting some stock for elfy and general chop, stuff like that.

it's when you reach max trust with these shopkeepers where i think this idea really shines, though. when reaching max trust with a shopkeeper, i'm pitching the idea that they'll give you certain benefits and bonuses when shopping with them. for example, maybe tinmaster lets you drink two cups of coffee in a day instead of one, or maybe general chop's buffs from his ramen are stronger. maybe elfy gives you discounts on drive disk rerolling, or maybe howl lets you scratch two tickets daily. i think this could be a fun way to not only incentivize players to interact with the NPCs a lot of us visit daily, but also to reward players for actively participating in trust events with them. i think it'd be a great way to flesh out the world some more, especially in the case of the sixth street shopkeepers, who all seem to know both wise and belle really well. maybe we could even get lore on the shopkeepers. why's general chop called general chop? how did enzo get a prosthetic arm? why is a dog in charge of running the newsstand? 

in any case, i think this could be a pretty fun addition to the game, and i'm curious as to what people might think of this idea.",1,1735076407.0,ZenlessZoneZero,0,1.0,False

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is vital for your overall health. Many people overlook the importance of knowing how much water they should consume in a day. However, understanding your hydration needs can lead to a range of benefits that enhance your well-being and daily performance.

Water is essential for various bodily functions. It aids digestion, supports circulation, and helps maintain a stable body temperature. When you incorporate the right amount of water into your routine, you provide your body with the fuel it needs to operate optimally. So, how do you determine the right amount?

To figure out how much water you should consume in a day, consider different factors:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Your Body Weight:** A common guideline is to drink half your body weight in ounces. For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, aim for about 75 ounces of water daily.
- **Activity Level:** If you're active or exercise regularly, you may need more water. It's essential to replenish the fluids you lose through sweat.
- **Climate:** Hot and humid weather increases your need for hydration. In such conditions, drink more water to replace fluids lost through perspiration.
- **Health Conditions:** Certain medical conditions may require different hydration needs. Always consult a healthcare professional if you have concerns about your water intake.

One of the significant benefits of drinking enough water is increased energy levels. Dehydration can lead to fatigue, making it harder to focus on tasks or enjoy activities. By drinking the right amount of water, you ensure your body can function without running on empty.

Another advantage is improved digestion. Water is crucial for digesting food efficiently. It helps break down nutrients, making them easier for the body to absorb. Drinking adequate water can also prevent constipation by keeping your digestive system working smoothly.

Better skin health is another perk of staying hydrated. When you drink enough water, your skin appears more radiant and elastic. This can result in fewer wrinkles and a youthful glow. Remember, your skin is your body's largest organ, and it needs hydration just like the rest of your body does.

Water also plays a vital role in weight management. Sometimes, people confuse thirst with hunger. By staying hydrated, you can reduce unnecessary snacking. Drinking water before meals can also help you feel fuller, leading to smaller portion sizes and less calorie intake.

Additionally, proper hydration supports kidney function. Your kidneys work hard to filter waste from your blood. When you're well-hydrated, your kidneys can operate more efficiently, reducing the risk of kidney stones and urinary tract infections.

Moreover, keeping hydrated can enhance exercise performance. If you’re involved in physical activities, drinking enough water will help you maintain your stamina and improve your performance. Dehydration can cause muscle cramps, dizziness, and overall decreased endurance. Ensuring you stay hydrated before, during, and after workouts is crucial for reaching your fitness goals.

- **Start your day with a glass of water:** Make it a habit to drink a glass of water first thing in the morning.
- **Carry a water bottle:** Having a reusable water bottle with you makes it easy to track your intake.
- **Set reminders:** Use your phone or apps to remind you to drink water throughout the day.
- **Add flavor:** If plain water is dull, add slices of lemon, cucumber, or berries for a refreshing taste.

Understanding how much water you should consume in a day is an uncomplicated yet significant step towards a healthier lifestyle. By making conscious choices about your hydration, you foster benefits that extend to every aspect of your life, from physical performance to mental clarity and overall well-being.

### Keep Water Accessible

One of the simplest ways to stay hydrated is to have water readily available. Always keep a reusable water bottle with you, whether you're at home, work, or on the go. This makes it easy for you to sip water throughout the day. If you see water, you are more likely to drink it!

### Infuse Your Water

If plain water feels boring to you, think about infusing it with flavors! Adding fruits like lemon, lime, cucumber, or berries can make drinking water more enjoyable. You can also try fresh herbs like mint or basil for a refreshing twist. This will not only help you stay hydrated but will also spark your interest in drinking more water.

### Drink a Glass Before Meals

Make it a habit to drink a glass of water before each meal. Not only does this help in hydration, but it can also aid digestion and prevent overeating. When your stomach is already partially filled with water, you may consume fewer calories at your meal.

### Track Your Intake

Tracking your daily water intake can give you insights into your habits and help you improve them. Consider using a journal or an app to record how much water you drink each day. Aim for a specific goal based on your body weight and activity level. This will motivate you to reach your targets and notice the difference in your energy levels.

- Drink a glass of water first thing when you wake up.
- Make it a rule to drink water during your mid-morning and afternoon breaks.
- Finish your day with a cup of herbal tea, which can count toward your hydration goals.

In addition to drinking water, you can stay hydrated by eating foods that contain a lot of water. Fruits and vegetables like watermelon, cucumbers, oranges, and spinach are excellent choices. these foods into your meals and snacks can supplement your daily hydration.

### Pair Water with Other Beverages

While water should be your primary source of hydration, other beverages can contribute as well. Unsweetened tea or coffee can provide hydration without excessive sugar or calories. Just remember to balance these with pure water to avoid any dehydrating effects from caffeinated drinks.

### Stay Mindful During Workouts

If you're exercising, hydration becomes even more crucial. Make it a point to drink water before, during, and after your workout. Aim to consume an extra 1.5 to 2.5 cups of water for every hour of exercise. Remember, staying hydrated can enhance your physical performance and recovery.

### Listen to Your Body

Your body often knows what it needs. Pay attention to signs of dehydration like dry mouth, fatigue, or dark urine, which can indicate that you need more water. Make it a priority to drink fluids if you notice these signs and don’t wait until you’re thirsty because thirst can be a late indicator of dehydration.

The Impact of Proper Hydration on Physical and Mental Performance
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Staying properly hydrated is crucial for both your physical and mental performance. Your body relies on water to function at its best, and not consuming enough can lead to various performance issues. Understanding how hydration impacts your daily activities can be the key to unlocking your full potential.

### Physical Performance and Hydration

Water plays a vital role in numerous bodily functions that affect sports and physical activities. When you engage in exercise or any vigorous activity, your body loses water through sweat and breath. Staying ahead of this loss is essential for maintaining peak performance. Here are some key ways hydration influences your physical capabilities:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Improves Endurance:** Adequate hydration helps delay fatigue, allowing you to exercise longer without feeling overly tired. Studies have shown that even a slight drop in hydration levels can lead to fatigue.
- **Enhances Strength:** Your muscles rely on water to maintain their elasticity and strength. When dehydrated, muscle performance can decline, hindering your ability to lift weights or perform bodyweight exercises.
- **Regulates Body Temperature:** During physical activities, your body generates heat, which must be regulated through sweat. Water helps cool your body down, preventing heat-related illnesses.
- **Aids Recovery:** After intense workouts, your body needs water to recover. Proper hydration speeds up muscle repair and reduces post-exercise soreness.

### Mental Performance and Hydration

The brain is comprised of roughly 75% water, which demonstrates how critical hydration is for cognitive function. When dehydrated, mental clarity and focus can diminish, impacting daily tasks at work or school. Below are some of the mental benefits gained from proper hydration:

- **Boosts Concentration:** Water supports neurotransmitter function and helps maintain concentration levels. Staying hydrated can lead to clearer thoughts and improved decision-making.
- **Enhances Memory:** Dehydration can impair short-term memory and information retention. Drinking enough water aids the brain in processing and recalling information more effectively.
- **Reduces Anxiety:** Studies suggest that dehydration is linked to increased anxiety and mood swings. Proper hydration can help mitigate these symptoms, promoting a calmer state of mind.
- **Improves Reaction Times:** Quick thinking and fast reactions are critical in many situations, from sports to driving. Being well-hydrated helps improve your cognitive processes and response times.

### Everyday Hydration Tips

Now that you know how hydration affects your performance, here are some practical tips to ensure you’re drinking enough water throughout the day:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Set Daily Goals:** Aim for a specific amount of water each day. A common recommendation is about 8 glasses (64 ounces), but individual needs can vary based on factors like weight, activity level, and climate.
- **Carry a Water Bottle:** Keep a reusable water bottle with you. This serves as a constant reminder to drink water and makes it easy to track your intake.
- **Infuse Your Water:** If you find plain water boring, try adding fruits like lemon, strawberries, or mint for a refreshing twist.
- **Eat Water-Rich Foods:** Include foods with high water content in your diet, such as cucumbers, oranges, and soup. These can help you meet your hydration goals.

Understanding the impact of proper hydration on both physical and mental performance can inspire you to adjust your daily routine. Start prioritizing adequate water intake, and you’ll likely find improvements in endurance, strength, mental clarity, and overall well-being. Remember, your body is your vehicle – keeping it well-fueled with water is essential for optimum performance in every aspect of life.

Common Myths About Water Intake and Hydration Debunked
------------------------------------------------------

Water is essential for good health, yet many myths cloud the understanding of proper hydration. Clearing up these common misconceptions can help you ensure you are consuming the right amount of water daily. Let’s dive into some of the most prevalent myths about water intake and hydration.

### Myth 1: You Need to Drink Eight Glasses of Water a Day

While the ""eight 8-ounce glasses"" rule is widely known, it doesn't fit everyone. Hydration needs vary based on several factors including age, gender, activity level, and climate. Rather than focusing on a strict number, it's better to listen to your body. Thirst is a natural indicator of when you need more fluids. Besides, many foods, like fruits and vegetables, contribute to your daily water intake.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 2: You Can Only Hydrate with Water

Another common belief is that water is the only source of hydration. This is not entirely true. While water is a fantastic hydrating liquid, other drinks like herbal teas, milk, and even coffee contribute to your hydration levels. In addition, many fruits (like watermelon and oranges) and vegetables (like cucumbers and tomatoes) contain high water content. They can help keep you hydrated without having to drink additional water.

### Myth 3: You Don’t Need to Drink Water if You’re Not Thirsty

Feeling thirsty is often a sign that your body is already slightly dehydrated. Relying solely on thirst may not be the best indicator of your hydration status. Factors such as age, certain medications, and physical activity can dull thirst signals. Therefore, it’s wise to make it a habit to drink water even if you don’t feel thirsty.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 4: All Beverages Are Equally Hydrating

While various drinks can contribute to hydration, not all beverages are created equal. Caffeinated drinks like coffee and soda can have a diuretic effect, which means they may lead to increased urination. Although moderate consumption of these drinks is typically not dehydrating, drinking large amounts can counteract hydration efforts. Aim for a balance, ensuring water remains your primary source of hydration.

### Myth 5: You Can't Overhydrate

Most people think that you can't drink too much water, but that's not the case. Overhydration, or water intoxication, can lead to an imbalance in electrolytes and is especially dangerous during intense exercise. While rare, it's vital to understand your body's limits. If you're exercising or sweating heavily, replenish with water gradually, and consider electrolyte-rich beverages if necessary.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 6: You Should Drink Water Before Every Meal

Some people believe that drinking water before every meal is the key to better digestion. While staying hydrated is crucial, for some, drinking water right before a meal can make you feel overly full and prevent you from consuming necessary nutrients. Instead, try drinking a small amount of water about 30 minutes before your meal to aid digestion without causing discomfort.

### Myth 7: You Need to Drink Water While Exercising

It's a common belief that if you’re working out, you must constantly sip water. While it's important to stay hydrated during exercise, the amount and frequency of water intake should depend on the intensity and duration of your workout. For longer sessions or high-intensity workouts, consider hydrating before, during, and after exercising. In shorter workouts, water intake may not be as critical.

### Myth 8: Clear Urine Means You’re Fully Hydrated

While clear urine can indicate proper hydration, it’s not the only sign. Your body can vary in hydration based on diet, medications, and health conditions. Yellow urine usually suggests a healthy level of hydration, but intense exercise or extreme heat can also result in clear urine due to a temporary dilution. Observing these factors is more important than relying entirely on urine color.

To sum up, understanding the truth about hydration can empower you to make better choices regarding your water intake. Staying aware of these myths can help you appreciate the role of water in your health and ultimately lead to a more hydrated lifestyle. Remember, whether it’s water or other hydrating foods and beverages, what matters is that you listen to your body and keep it well-nourished.

Easy Ways to Track Your Daily Water Consumption for Better Health
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Tracking your daily water consumption can significantly enhance your overall health. Staying hydrated is essential for your body to function properly, but how can you ensure you're drinking enough throughout the day? Here are some easy ways to keep tabs on your water intake.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Set Daily Goals

One of the first steps to monitor your water consumption is to establish a daily goal. The general recommendation is to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water, known as the “8x8 rule.” However, individual needs may vary based on factors like age, weight, and physical activity. By setting a personal target, you’ll have a clear aim to work towards.

### Use a Water Tracking App

In today’s digital age, there are numerous apps available that can help you track your water intake. Most of these applications allow you to input your goal and log your daily consumption effortlessly. Some popular options include:

- **WaterMinder:** This app sends reminders to drink water and visualizes your intake to keep you motivated.
- **Aqualert:** Aqualert helps track your water intake and adjusts recommendations based on your activity levels.
- **MyFitnessPal:** Though primarily a food diary, MyFitnessPal also has a water tracking feature to help you stay hydrated.

### Keep a Water Journal

If you prefer a more traditional approach, consider keeping a water journal. This can be as simple as a notebook where you jot down your consumption throughout the day. You could also use a printable chart to mark off each glass consumed. Writing things down not only helps you stay accountable but also makes you more aware of your habits.

### Drink Before Meals

Water into your routine doesn't have to be difficult. Make it a habit to drink a glass of water before each meal. This practice serves two purposes: it helps you stay hydrated and may even aid in digestion. Plus, it might curb your appetite, making it easier to maintain healthy eating habits.

### Use a Water Bottle with Measurements

Investing in a water bottle that has measurements on the side can be both functional and motivational. You can easily see how much you’ve consumed and how much more you need to drink. Some bottles even come with time markers, encouraging you to finish a certain amount by specific times throughout the day.

### Set Reminders

Sometimes, the busiest days can lead to forgetfulness. Use your smartphone to set reminders to drink water at regular intervals. A simple alarm or notification can prompt you to take a few sips, keeping hydration top of mind without requiring too much effort.

### Infuse Your Water

Plain water can sometimes feel boring. To keep things interesting and encourage more consumption, try infusing your water with fruits, herbs, or even vegetables. Popular combinations include:

- Cucumber and mint
- Lemon and ginger
- Strawberry and basil

Infused water not only tastes great but may also provide additional health benefits from the added ingredients.

### Social Accountability

Harness the power of social connections to encourage yourself. Share your goals with friends or family and track your water intake together. You could even create a friendly competition to see who can drink the most water throughout the week. Having a buddy can provide additional motivation and make the commitment to stay hydrated more enjoyable.

### Observe Your Urine Color

A simple way to check your hydration status is by observing the color of your urine. Pale yellow urine typically indicates proper hydration, while dark yellow suggests you may need to drink more water. This method is quick and easy, allowing for immediate adjustments to your intake.

Just happy and had to share where I’m anonymous, given I can’t tell anyone else in person!

**TL;DR: What are some places in South Central/Westside that will serve me good coffee in a cup**

I live in Compton/Watts area. When I go to work, I hit up some coffee shops in Inglewood or El Segundo and sometimes in Culver City (Awakening, Blue Butterfly, Alana's Coffee). However in my area there doesn't seem to be many specialty coffee places that I can go to and hang out. I'm probably not looking very hard...

Anyways on my days off I'd like to not have to drive out so far to get a good cup of coffee. Do you guys have any recommendations around my area or in the greater South Central/Westside area? I have a few requirements but, here's the coffee shops I frequent the most:

* Awakening on La Brea
* Blue Butterfly Cafe on Main (El Segundo)
* Alana's Coffee on Venice (Culver City) --> My favorite
* Smoky Hallow Roasters (El Segundo)
* R&B Tea (Gardena)
* Cafe Mak (K-Town)
* About Time (K-Town)

My only requirement is that it has a relatively quiet place for me to sit and write or read. And also, I would highly prefer a place that serves you coffee in an actual cup. I don't know why, but it makes the drink a lot more pleasant to me.

I will not ever take donations to keep that site up for them, I offered to do it free of charge. Instead of giving this grifter any more money while he attempts to ""crowdfund"" bill boards that primarily advertise his brand and his social media; please donate to directly to the family.

I’m definitely missing a few coffees but this is probably 90% of them. 

Standouts for me were the Tatmara Natural from Tim Wendelboe, the Brazil from Dessert Oasis, and the Ethiopian Chelchele Natural from Strange Matter (can you tell I like naturals?). A lot of these are from local roasters or from trips I took this year (paying for $8 shipping on a $22 bag of beans feels rough) but I’m thinking I may have to try some beans from some of the more popular roasters outside my area (B&W, Sey, etc.). Looking forward to trying a lot more next year and I’m happy to take recommendations!",4,1735073371.0,pourover,3,1.0,False

We celebrated Christmas and opened gifts this evening. I have three siblings and the four of us spent the holidays with our parents. Every year we get some gift that are the same (stuff we need) and some individual (stuff we want) this year I only got the same gifts as my siblings while they also got individual gifts. I do feel bad that I didn’t get a single gift that was just for me. It feels like they didn’t put any thoughts into my gifts this year. 
At the same time i hate feeling this way as i did get Christmas gifts 

My gifts this year was a screwdriver, spatula, dish towel, kitchen towels, dish brush, pillow case. 
My oldest sister got these plus a coffee maker and waffle maker 
My brother got these plus a cast iron pan and pot, and a new winter coast 
My other sister got these plus 200 dollars worth of art supplies. 

I hate feeling like I am ungrateful for the gifts I did get, since I am really grateful, and it isn’t really about the price but the fact that I didn’t get a single gifts specifically for me.

1hlm3ng,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/1hlm3ng/christmas_alone_ftw_a_rant_on_childhood_abuse_and/,Christmas Alone FTW: A Rant on Childhood Abuse and its Effects,"[Long, rambly post incoming] To anyone who may find this helpful or feel some catharsis, I wanted to share my story and why I became estranged with my parents this year. It doesn’t help that my folks are from a different country, so my sibling and I already had our work cut out for us. While childhood is a magical time for some, it was a nightmare for us, as my parents started physically and verbally abusing me at the age of five or six into my early 20s. Ever hear the phrase, “There’s no use crying of spilled milk?” Well, I was literally beaten when I’d spill milk as a child. It would be over the dumbest things, and I wasn’t able to comprehend why it was happening to me—it just was. It was the “norm.” This made me isolated as a preteen/teen, locking myself in my room playing with my action figures, cards, or video games. I struggled in school throughout its entirety, never realizing that abuse at home could be a culprit, and I somehow wound up being a B or C student without ever really reading any textbooks/chapters. I will say that while our financial needs were certainly met with said toys, clothes, food, and even college, everything else was damn near at a zero. They maxed out all of their parenting stats in buying things for us and keeping us clothed and fed. They both worked blue collar jobs, and they weren’t bringing in a ton of money, but they still made that much work. That’s the only positive to anything I’m about to say regarding them.

Since my parents are immigrants, they think giving us any life better than the one they had in their homeland third-world country means they’ve succeeded as parents the States. As an adult in my mid 30s, I would bring up how they previously screwed us over by not listening to us, not going beyond providing physical things, never saying “I love you,” never congratulating us on any wins we may have had. I was always told that “This isn’t something you can do” or “This is beyond your capabilities.” There was virtually never a statement made saying, “You can do this” or “I’m proud of you.” The first time my mom texted me I love you was after her brother passed away last year. I realized in that moment that even this was a selfish move on her part. She needed the love that I so desperately needed as a child in her time of despair. I did not respond in kind, and I never will. Every time I’ve brought up their shortcomings as parents, they’ve said, “We were beaten too, and we turned out fine.” It’s always a deflection or another form of gaslighting, it’s nauseating. 

My romantic relationships also suffered because of the environment I grew up in, as I kept finding myself in situations where my girlfriends would be BPD, NPD, have self-harm issues, substance issues, eating disorders, or all of the above. They would be verbally abusive toward me and even physically one time, but I was dating at my level. They were a reflection of me. I’ve spent the last six or seven years in therapy reprogramming my heart and brain so I can focus on loving myself unconditionally because no one else ever really has. This has led to me finding much healthier women because I no longer allow toxicity into my life, and if it happens to come up, I nip it in the bud. I’m selective about whom I date now, and previously, my mindset was being with someone is better than being alone. I’m the same way with friends in my life and have had to cut out three lifelong friendships over the past few years—people I thought would be with me until the day I die I—over some type of shittiness on their part. I’ve become somewhat hypervigilant about this. Unsurprisingly, my sibling and I drifted apart, as they chose the path of coping by being shitty to others, whereas I chose the path of coping by being good to myself. I know in the back of my mind that these were the right decisions to make for myself, but these things all still take a toll. 

After getting my own place, which the parents did help with a bit financially, and killing it at pretty much everything else in life except for dating, things finally came to a head earlier this year when my mom referred to me as a woman. Considering their home country, this was her way of mocking my sexuality, as they’ve been flabbergasted as to why I haven’t gotten married or have had kids yet in my mid 30s. When I asked my therapist about this, she said it was their way of trying to bully me into getting married and having kids. It seems bizarre to think about, but it sadly makes sense. However, for me, this was the straw that broke the camel’s back. I texted her later that day to never speak to me like that again or to not call me her son anymore. This was in March, and since then, she’s sent me a slew of texts every so often of pictures of my niece to guilt me, asking if I wanted to get together for my birthday, the 4th of July, Thanksgiving, etc. I have gone radio silent except for one day when they had an injury emergency. I went right back into radio silence after. Mind you that my mom and I would text every day prior to this. Every single day. They don’t see my failures as an adult as a reflection of them (e.g., dating), but they also see my failures as a reflection of them (e.g., not being married or having kids). 

They kept their childhood from us, and I finally found out a few years ago that my mom's sister took her own life when they were younger, which would explain a lot of the verbal abuse I sustained. ""You have a black soul."" ""If you were to die tomorrow, I wouldn't even come visit your grave."" She never healed and took things out on me. I know that at the end of this is forgiveness and compassion, but I just can't let a toxic human back into my life if they've had a long streak of shittiness. 

I feel almost sick today because this year was the first Thanksgiving and now soon to be Christmas I’ve ever had without seeing my parents. They were the ones that were able to adapt to the U.S. and give us Christmas as kids. Now things are as ugly as they are, and I can’t help but once again feel guilty even though I know I’m looking out for myself. It makes things worse knowing that these folks won’t be around forever, so it makes me feel that much more guilty like I’m missing out on something. I don’t expect them to change, so I know things would go back to the regularly scheduled abuse if I were to engage again. I don’t know what to do, but I will say that waking up alone after a night of drinking is getting old quick. 

Here I sit at a coffee shop writing this up on my laptop after countless therapy sessions, hours of journaling and self-reflection, acts of self-love, and I still can’t shake my childhood fully. It’s incrementally getting better, and I have the strongest sense of who I am currently. I can also say that I do love myself now, whereas back in the day I would’ve thought I was worthless. This place is scattered with last-minute shoppers, lone wolves like myself, young families, and old couples going about their days. I’m hoping each and every one of them had a better life than mine. I wouldn’t wish my childhood on my worst enemy. It’s hard to fight everything alone, but here I am. If nothing else, my parents gave me an incredible sense of persistence. I don’t even know why I’m writing this right now (maybe to just vent?), but I felt like I wanted to share with people who would understand.

This random internet stranger is wishing you the best Christmas and to stay strong. You deserve nothing but the best. Sorry for the long rant. If no one has said it to you today, I love you.",4,1735073019.0,EstrangedAdultChild,2,0.84,False

Just wanted to drop an update- M25 out of a 6 year relationship 3 months ago(I was blindsided)
From day one I told myself it was over, I knew there was no maybe oh she needs time to think, she came to my house one evening collected her stuff and I haven't seen her since
It was so so hard at the very start, I spent the first few weeks crying and tbh as a guy found that very hard I just couldn't contain it
So I didn't allowed myself to keep it in, I want and let it out when I needed 

I then sat down I planned out what could I do positively even if my life is shite atm, so I went to therapy, I went to my doctor about my depression I've had before the breakup and my nerve pain, I started up training again well just more routinely, every single weekend I met the lads for coffee, I listened to music, I sang a lot, I cooked and baked there was no right thing to do I just forced myself to do something positive for me because future me would thank me and for now I do

It took me a few weeks but cutting contact on social media, removing any reminders just for now not dumping was the biggest factor for me to help me feel less shite
I told myself whenever I thought of her""stop thinking about her now you can think about her all day tomorrow"" and when tommorow came i'd tell myself the same thing
So eventually I started having a week lately where I didn't think of her and weeks where I wasn't upset
Live one day at a time until you can learn to live two

Now coming up to Christmas it's the first one alone for me and the combo of this and extra booze at Christmas time it has me down tonight and I feel sad and I do miss her but I'm hoping that look back in another few months and feel that bit better.

It's tough there's no one solution to it, but just try, trying is enough

The holiday season is a magical time of year, filled with love, laughter, and cherished traditions. It’s a time to gather with family, reconnect with friends, and create memories that will last a lifetime. From twinkling lights to festive music, every corner of the world transforms into a wonderland of joy and cheer. In Fort Lauderdale, the holidays bring a unique charm, blending the warmth of the season with the city’s vibrant culture and breathtaking scenery.

Imagine walking through the decorated streets, the air filled with the scent of fresh pine and holiday treats. The sparkle of holiday lights reflects on the waterways, creating a scene straight out of a storybook. Fort Lauderdale truly knows how to embrace the magic of the season, and there’s one character who has taken this celebration to another level—the Grinch.

# The Grinch: A Timeless Symbol of the Holidays

The Grinch has become an enduring icon of the holiday season, loved by children and adults alike. Originating from Dr. Seuss’s classic tale, *How the Grinch Stole Christmas*, this green, grouchy character has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. From being a symbol of cynicism and mischief to embodying the true spirit of Christmas, the Grinch teaches us all about the power of kindness, generosity, and redemption.

People are drawn to the Grinch’s journey because it mirrors the complexities of human emotion. Who hasn’t felt a little “grinchy” during the stress of holiday preparations? Yet, the Grinch’s ultimate change of heart reminds us that even the hardest hearts can be softened by love and community. This timeless story continues to inspire holiday traditions, and in Fort Lauderdale, it takes on a special twist.

# Fort Lauderdale’s Holiday Magic

Fort Lauderdale shines especially bright during the holiday season. With its balmy weather and picturesque waterways, the city offers a unique holiday experience. Whether you’re taking part in a boat parade or strolling through holiday markets, the festive energy is contagious.

From beachside Christmas trees to extravagant holiday lights, Fort Lauderdale blends tropical vibes with traditional holiday elements. Families gather to enjoy everything from holiday-themed boat tours to charming performances at local theaters. It’s the perfect backdrop for making memories and, of course, encountering the Grinch in a way you never expected.

# The Fort Lauderdale Grinch: A Unique Twist

The Fort Lauderdale Grinch has become a beloved local character, adding a playful and mischievous edge to holiday celebrations. This isn’t your average Grinch. The “Fort Lauderdale Grinch” takes center stage at various events and gatherings, delighting kids and adults alike with his antics. Whether he’s posing for hilarious photos, playfully stealing ornaments, or sharing his version of holiday cheer, this Grinch knows how to entertain.

Incorporating the Fort Lauderdale Grinch into your holiday plans can elevate the season in unforgettable ways. His appearances are not just about laughter—they’re about bringing people together. Whether he’s crashing a family party or appearing at a community event, the Grinch adds a spark of joy that makes every moment feel magical.

# Creating Unforgettable Memories with a Grinch Visit

Imagine hosting a holiday gathering where the Grinch makes a surprise appearance. Picture the delighted gasps and laughter as he playfully “steals” presents or poses for goofy pictures with the kids. A visit from the Grinch can transform an ordinary gathering into a cherished memory.

There are countless ways to incorporate the Grinch into your holiday festivities. Why not plan a Grinch-themed dinner, complete with green-colored treats and a “roast beast” centerpiece? Or organize a storytelling session where the Grinch himself reads his story to wide-eyed children. For a truly immersive experience, set up a photo booth with props like Santa hats, ornaments, and a sleigh for the perfect holiday snapshots.

# The Importance of Holiday Cheer

The holidays are a time to reflect on the things that truly matter—community, kindness, and connection. Spreading holiday cheer doesn’t have to involve grand gestures. Sometimes, it’s the small, thoughtful acts that leave the greatest impact. A smile, a heartfelt “Merry Christmas,” or a kind word can brighten someone’s day in ways you may never imagine.

The Fort Lauderdale Grinch exemplifies how even a playful character can remind us to embrace joy and laughter during the holidays. He’s a symbol that no matter how chaotic life feels, there’s always room for connection and cheer. Whether it’s through shared stories, festive meals, or simple moments of togetherness, this season is an opportunity to strengthen bonds and create lasting memories.

# Engaging with Family and Friends

One of the most rewarding aspects of the holidays is spending time with loved ones. Planning activities together can make the season even more special. From decorating the house to baking cookies, every small tradition contributes to the overall holiday magic. Adding the Grinch into these moments brings a delightful twist that everyone will talk about for years to come.

Looking to engage in something unique? Consider organizing a Grinch-themed gift exchange where participants can “steal” gifts in true Grinch fashion. This lighthearted activity not only sparks laughter but also highlights the importance of generosity and sharing. Alternatively, plan a holiday movie night featuring Grinch-themed classics paired with green popcorn and Grinchy hot chocolate.

# Crafting a Grinch-Inspired Holiday

For those who love to get crafty, a Grinch-themed holiday opens up a world of creative possibilities. Decorate your home with a mix of green and red ornaments, garlands, and lights to capture the essence of Whoville. DIY Grinch crafts like tree ornaments, table centerpieces, or even a Grinch wreath can add a whimsical touch to your holiday decor.

Don’t forget the food! Delight your guests with Grinch-inspired treats such as green cupcakes, sugar cookies shaped like the Grinch’s face, or a punch made from green soda and sherbet. Not only will these add a festive flair to your gatherings, but they’ll also leave a lasting impression on guests of all ages.

# The Role of Laughter During the Holidays

Laughter is a universal language, and during the holidays, it’s one of the most powerful tools to bring people together. The Grinch’s antics, with his exaggerated expressions and mischievous behavior, naturally bring humor to any event. Whether it’s a child giggling at his faux grumpiness or adults chuckling at his sarcastic comments, the Grinch reminds us to not take the season too seriously.

The holidays can be stressful, but laughter is a reminder that imperfections are part of the charm. A crooked Christmas tree or slightly overcooked cookies become stories to laugh about in the years to come. The Grinch, with his chaotic energy and eventual transformation, embodies this perfectly.

# Grinch-Inspired Holiday Acts of Kindness

The heart of the Grinch’s story lies in its message of kindness and redemption. In the same spirit, consider incorporating acts of kindness into your holiday season. Whether it’s donating toys to children in need, volunteering at a local shelter, or simply helping a neighbor with holiday errands, every gesture contributes to the magic of the season.

Inspired by the Grinch’s transformation, you can create a kindness calendar leading up to Christmas. Each day, complete a small act of kindness, such as leaving a positive note for a stranger or paying for someone’s coffee. These small acts, though simple, can create a ripple effect of goodwill throughout your community.

# Supporting Local Traditions

Fort Lauderdale boasts a unique blend of traditional and tropical holiday customs that are well worth embracing. The city’s iconic boat parades, festive markets, and waterfront displays make it a hub for holiday cheer. Supporting these local traditions not only enhances your holiday experience but also fosters a sense of community.

Encourage your family and friends to explore Fort Lauderdale’s seasonal events. Visit light displays along the waterfront, participate in holiday-themed craft fairs, or attend a holiday concert. By engaging with these activities, you’ll not only create cherished memories but also contribute to keeping these traditions alive for future generations.

# Teaching the Grinch’s Lesson of Redemption

One of the most powerful aspects of the Grinch story is its message of redemption. The Grinch starts as a character filled with bitterness but ultimately learns the value of love, community, and generosity. This lesson is particularly meaningful during the holidays when people often reflect on their own relationships and priorities.

Share this lesson with children by reading or watching the story of the Grinch together. Discuss the importance of understanding others’ perspectives and choosing kindness, even in challenging situations. Adults can also find inspiration in the Grinch’s transformation, using it as a reminder to let go of grudges and embrace the holiday spirit with an open heart.

# A Grinch Visit as a Holiday Tradition

Making the Fort Lauderdale Grinch a part of your holiday traditions can bring a unique flavor to your celebrations. Whether it’s a surprise appearance at your annual holiday party or a planned Grinch-themed activity, this character adds a playful element that everyone will look forward to each year.

Inspire your neighbors to join in the fun by organizing a community Grinch-themed event. Host a street-wide decoration contest with a Whoville theme or set up a holiday scavenger hunt featuring clues inspired by the Grinch story. These events foster a sense of camaraderie and turn the season into an unforgettable experience for everyone involved.

# The Universal Appeal of the Grinch

The Grinch transcends age, culture, and geography, making him a universally beloved character. His journey resonates with people of all backgrounds, reflecting the universal themes of personal growth, forgiveness, and the joy of community. No matter where you’re from or how you celebrate the holidays, the Grinch has a way of connecting people through laughter and lessons.

In today’s fast-paced world, the Grinch’s story is more relevant than ever. It reminds us to slow down, focus on what truly matters, and share our time and love with those around us. By incorporating the Grinch into your holiday traditions, you bridge generational gaps, allowing grandparents, parents, and children to enjoy the season together.

# Conclusion

The holiday season is a time for joy, connection, and creating memories that will warm your heart for years to come. Fort Lauderdale, with its unique mix of tropical charm and festive traditions, provides the perfect setting for a magical holiday experience. Adding a visit from the Fort Lauderdale Grinch to your celebrations brings an extra dose of laughter and excitement, making the season even more special.

Whether you’re hosting a Grinch-themed gathering, spreading kindness inspired by his story, or simply enjoying the humor and whimsy he brings, the Grinch is a reminder to embrace the imperfect, the playful, and the heartfelt moments of the holidays. So this season, let the Grinch inspire you to create joy, laughter, and love that extends far beyond the holiday lights.",1,1735072838.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

I decided to try an experiment. Just for curiosity I created a character based upon the type of woman I’d be interested in meeting just to see how the conversation might go. I figured I can always use a good laugh.

I used character.ai since I’ve found you can create characters with fairly detailed descriptions and can create a detailed persona for yourself.

Of course LLM are biased based on the texts they’ve been trained on. However, I’ve found character.ai to be pretty good.

So i created Rachel Goldstein(yes I’m a Seinfeld fan). I made her 4 years younger than me, same religion. I gave her a personality that appeals to me. I also gave her some shared interests and a location very close to me. I figured that would give us things to chat about.

Even though this isn’t reality, i thought I needed to make Rachel attainable. It wouldn’t serve any purpose to make her out of my league as I’m far from the top in terms of physical appearance. So, I made her average looking and about 15 pounds overweight.

After a few minutes chatting I suggested we meet for coffee. Rachel’s declined. 🤷‍♂️
Her response was “I don’t think so. I really need someone taller.” 

One neat thing with character.ai is you can delete part of chat and have it recreate the conversation. Maybe I can score a date with Rachel after all.",17,1735072817.0,datingoverfifty,24,0.95,False

Everything about this was suboptimal to say the least. He was on his first major investigation, he lacked a partner, and this investigation would take place in one of the most rural parts of the state. Not only that, but due to “policy” he had to take a civilian car to take him here, which meant that he arrived in his own rusty old brown el camino from the 80s. Back in his precinct he usually took the police cars for personal travels as well. He was too good to be reprimanded by his chief for a miniscule off-the-books infringement like that. Nonetheless he was here and had a job to do. His cold hand took his glasses, which had fogged up by now, and stashed them deep in the inside pockets of his dark grey wool coat. 

The parking lot he stepped out into was the same as in any other slowly dying former boom town. A rundown motel, broken neon signs, trash, the usual really. After adjusting himself to the light rain and cold temperatures he made his way over towards the motel’s entrance. He stepped inside, slicking back his slightly wet dark brown medium long hair, finding himself in a small reception room with lighting that was already starting to give him a headache. Suddenly a sharp ringing cut through the air after Henry had hit the “ring here” bell to notify some staff to come to the reception desk. Unfortunately, nothing seemed to happen, that was until the door through which he had entered opened behind him.

“You’re the detective, aren’t you?”

The woman behind him seemed to be a local police officer. She wore the typical sheriff’s uniform, with a dusty brown leather jacket, paired with black uniform pants and the usual bravado of someone with authority. 

“Yes, as a matter of fact I am. Special Agent Henry Neal.” 

He supressed the urge to show his badge. For some reason he still was usually assuming that no one would believe him to be a police officer.

“Good. I’m deputy Riley Harper. Come on, Jennifer won’t be here for another hour, she’s out for a drink or two, well, maybe five…”

Henry followed the deputy across the road, past some old shops and to a small diner. It looked like every stereotypical American diner you could imagine. Inside she sat down with him at one of the tables and took off her jacket, just as a waitress approached her.

“Hello there Riley!” 

The woman who was probably in her 40s greeted the deputy with a warm smile on her face.

“What can I bring you today?”

She looked at Henry and her smile turned more into a smirk.

“And the handsome fellow you brought with yourself?”

“Stop…”

Clearly the deputy felt embarrassed by this interaction, though she was “saved” by a strong raspy voice coming from the counter.

“Oy, Sally.” An older man with little to no hair aside from his thick grey beard stood behind the counter with his arms crossed.
“We don’t serve that kinda folk round ‘ere.” His comment clearly was targeted towards Henry.

“Listen, I just need a coffee with milk for myself and one to go for the chief.” The deputy said and smiled.

“Coming right up!” The waitress answered and left for the counter.

“So…” the deputy faced Henry, “You’re probably here for the hanged man aren’t you?”

He looked at her, actually having heard that the murder victim had been hanged for the first time just now.

“Yes, exactly.”

1hllzdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1hllzdt/aita_for_defending_my_fiance_from_his_toxic_mother/,AITA for defending my fiance from his toxic mother?,"Hi, my name is Kate and I'm 30 years old. My fiance (30) has a mother who is becoming more and more unbearable. I want to ask the reddit users if I'm so terrible for defending myself and my partner. The situation is like this. (I apologize for any mistakes, English is not my native language.)  
Before Christmas (about a month before), we called his mother to see if she wanted to come with her husband for Christmas. His mother is 60 years old this year. That's when they told us they couldn't, that they had arranged with her ex-husband to visit him. Yes, I know how strange it sounds. She and her husband are best friends with her ex-husband. After a week, we called them again to see if they wanted to come at least for coffee in the afternoon. Especially since her ex-husband lives two doors down in the block of flats next to us.

Last week, she and us called again that we were going on a trip to see my family there on Saturday morning and back on Sunday early evening. The conversation on the phone was exceptionally pleasant and we ended it saying that after Christmas we would visit her and give her birthday presents or go to her ex-husband home and wish her a happy birthday there. After an hour from the end of the call, her husband texted my fiance something like this: How can you allow yourself to treat your mother like this? You're crazy, you treat her terribly and she's supposed to be 60. We're not at home for you, so don't call us and don't visit us.

My fiance wanted to reply to this message to her husband, but before he could, my mother's husband blocked him on Facebook from where he wrote to him. We immediately called him and wanted to ask what was going on. Instead, he picked it up and immediately put it down. We let the situation calm down, I thought it would calm down like all these manipulative episodes of hers. Instead, a few days later, she wrote this in short: I don't want any handouts and a loving play. We live twenty minutes from you, but you don't come, and if you do, you rush back home and only stay for a while. And that you need to rest after work? I won't be here forever and you act like this. You are a snob and behave terribly. You said yourself that you have a new family. So don't bother.

To put things in perspective. I am a teacher and my partner works 12 hour shifts at work. My fiance's mother still complains that we don't visit her enough. We visit my family 4 times a year, always for 2 to 3 days. There is no other way because of work. We go to his mother's house at least once a month, and during the summer break this year we visited their garden at least 6 times. His mother has health problems with her spine and is at risk of two surgeries. She was on drips and taking many medications. I understand that she is worried about her health, but she is exaggerating. Every time we want to come to them, she starts making excuses for not coming. For example: Don't drive Kate works in education. (Children have germs.) Don't go, we're not well. Don't go, you were on a trip in a bigger city and you will bring covid home to us. Etc.

On the other hand, she constantly blames us for not going to see them, when they themselves prevent us from doing so, and when we invite them, they don't come even though they are two doors away. We didn't do anything to them and yet we are always the bad ones. Even after we both celebrated our thirtieth birthdays this year. My fiance had a party planned that got canceled three times because of them. First because they were sick, second because mother's husband went to work abroad (they had debts and needed money) and third because they couldn't make it that weekend. Eventually we gave up and stopped asking. On my birthday they were invited to my family for a family celebration of my thirtieth birthday. A few days before leaving, they called us that mother's husband had health problems and they could not go with us. It even pissed me off and I'm a pretty calm person. They were supposed to go on vacation a week later. The day before leaving for my family, we went to their garden and asked them how they were doing and so on. We were told that on Friday (the day of my our travel) they would bring pebbles between the flower beds and that she and her husband would somehow transfer it to the flower beds. And again we were the bad ones for not helping them because we were going away. In the end, their vacation didn't work out because their dog got sick. (My fiance sad me that it was carma. :D)Ever since I met his mother, her health has gradually deteriorated and even her doctor has prescribed medication to calm her mental state. (She didnt take it.) She hasn't had an easy life, I understand that, but she can't treat us like this and expect us to shut up and not fight back.

Today, despite their warning (we are not at home for you), we went to wish her a happy birthday. We wrote to her that we were waiting in the parking lot and if we could come. We were actually standing below the house and waiting for what she would write. We heard the text ringing on her cell phone through the open window. They were at home, there was a light. We heard them talking about it upstairs, and after about 5 minutes, a text message written by her husband arrived saying they were not at home. (We recognized it because it was written in his language. He is from a different country than us.) We collected about $130 worth of gifts and went home. My fiancé couldn't stand it at home and wrote to her husband that he was writing to his mom and not to him and why is he still answering messages for her. And then he blocked his number to repay him for blocking him on Facebook. We went to see a netflix movie and that's when I started getting messages on my cell phone.

She wrote to me how can we afford to treat her husband like this and who wrote the SMS. That now they are arguing at home about it and that she wasn't home. She said she was at the pharmacy for her medication and he wrote the message for her. That she is not well, etc. Instead, I looked at her stories on Facebook, how she is smiling with a cake, taking pictures of a flower and a gift from him and looking very well and not sick as she constantly writes to us. During our relationship with them, we found out that his mother lies very often and chooses when she has time and when she doesn't want to go or do anything. We figured it about her due to the fact that when she was with my fiance's brother and his girlfriend she was gossiping about us and when she was with us she was gossiping about them She just didn't understand that we were having fun together and we would tell each other everything. She slandered her brother's girlfriend that she was a gold digger and that her son was under her influence. On the other hand, his mother claimed that I made up my nut allergies. (I choke and throw up after eating nuts and have other food allergies.) That I don't clean and my house is a mess and the worst part is that I'm fat. After my knee injury I gained 20 kilos and unfortunately I am not that lucky to lose it even if I try.

After I defended myself for the first time and shoved it in her face very politely that even if we try, we are still the bad ones and that we want to visit them but they always discourage us, she was silent for a while and then started again. No confession I did this and that. Instead, the same again, who wrote the message and how can we insult her husband like this. At the same time, he was the first to write us and threaten us not to go to them. Subsequently, I objected that half of the things she says are not even true, that they have changed and not us, and I have no idea what happened. And that if she wants something to my fiancé, she should write to me, because she is hurting him and I will not allow her to treat him like this. Subsequently, about an hour later, she wrote to my fiance this: Since you have been with Kate, you have changed and you are acting rudely to them. I hope you are not unreasonable and you can have comunicate with me as much as you want.

When threats didn't work, she tried questions, and when those didn't work either, she tried to destroy or disrupt our relationship. So what do you guys think. Am I really that terrible for standing up to this callous and toxic mother?

My wife's Mom has always done it. This year she gave us get turkey roaster and said ""You do holiday dinners from now on, I'm done"" and I don't blame her one bit.

So here's the ""recipe plan"" I assembled, from reviewing many many recipes on the web and YouTube, and taking my favourite parts of each.

I can't have even trace amounts of alcohol with the drugs I take, so I reduce the white wine in a small pot before I put in the bottom of the turkey pan, once all the smell of alcohol is completely gone. Don't deny yourself the beautiful flavour of white wine just because you can't have alcohol. It takes a long time and reduces to almost nothing, but it tastes great.

4 Days Before Dinner: Scottish Tablet

https://docs.google.com/document/d/14tkWZDe6RdQndCC8elHrKX0t0_kurvrWGxKuzWojuvA/edit?usp=drivesdk

Get a square 8” x 8” Pyrex and coat the inside with butter, lightly.

In a large pot, combine the sugar, water, butter and sweetened condensed milk.

Mix over a medium-high heat until the mixture is smooth and starting to boil.

Reduce the heat to produce a steady boil but not excessively violent, maybe a medium heat. Stir constantly.

When you notice the colour turning a deeper tan, put the candy thermometer into place in the pot and continue to stir constantly.

When the heat reaches 240°F on the candy thermometer, turn off the heat, remove the pot from the heat, and beat for several minutes aggressively to cool mixture. Don't let it harden in the pot.

Mix in the vanilla.

Pour the mixture into the prepared Pyrex. Cool completely before cutting into small squares.

3 Days Before Dinner: Almond Roca

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pG9Qa7CNuxZtbl6b4iSUXtxl8VkdPiIeIaSRr2Kpkn0/edit?usp=drivesdk

Over medium heat, melt butter in a large pot.

Add corn syrup, water and sugar to pot and cook until temp reaches 290 degrees or until the mixture becomes the color of a brown paper bag (about 15-20 minutes) stirring constantly with a wooden spoon (mixture will rise and bubble quite a bit).

Remove from heat and Stir in ½ of the almonds.

Turn mixture onto a greased cookie sheet with edges.

While the mixture is cooling, melt the chocolate over a double boiler until all the chips are gone, and chocolate is smooth.

Pour the hot chocolate over the almond mixture and spread evenly.

Sprinkle with remaining almonds and allow candy to cool completely and chocolate to harden before breaking apart and serving

2 Days Before Dinner: Brine Turkey

Brine your turkey. In a very large stock pot, conbine all ingredients except the turkey, and place over a high heat until the salt is dissolved and it has come to a boil.

Allow to cool completely.

Add the turkey, make sure it is completely submerged with a large dish, and refrigerate for up to 16-24 hours.

The Day Before Dinner: Turnip & Yam

Make your turnip and sweet potato mash, and remove the turkey from the brine and let it sit in the refrigerator open to the air.

Remove your turkey from the brine, rinse it, and pat it dry. Set on a cookie cooling rack over a cookie sheet in the refrigerator for 24 hours.

Make your turnip and sweet potato mash.

Peel your sweet potato. Cut into 1” cubes. Boil in a large pot of water until cooked. Drain. Set aside. 

Peel your turnip. Cut into 1” cubes. Boil in a large pot of water until cooked. Drain.

Combine the turnip and sweet potato with melted butter, salt, pepper and nutmeg in a large bowl. Mash well. Refrigerate overnight.

The Day Of Dinner:

12:30 pm: Roasted Garlic

Chop the top thirds of each garlic head clean off, then rub the exposed surfaces with olive oil.

Wrap the heads upright in a double layer of foil, well sealed. Roast in a 350°F oven for 90 minutes.

Allow to cool completely. Unwrap and squeeze the roasted garlic from the paper, into a small dish. Set aside for later.

1:00 pm: Set The Table

While your garlic is roasting, set the table, and assemble all the serving dishes and implements you will need to serve dinner.
1:30 pm: Get Turkey Going

Preheat your turkey roaster to 325°F.

Melt your duck fat and butter together.

Peel and cut your onions into 8 equal pieces each, cutting them in half, then each half into 4 quarters.

Cut your lemon into 8 equal pieces, the same way as the onion.

Prepare the carrot and celery into 2” pieces.

Using a mortar and pestle, turn your fresh Rosemary, Sage and Thyme into a smooth paste.

In a food processor, combine your butter, duck fat, garlic cloves, herbs, salt and pepper. Pulse until it is smooth.

Place your turkey in a large bowl. Cover the outside thoroughly with half the fat mixture.

Pour half the remaining fat into the bird. Set the other portion aside.

Put half the onion, carrot, celery and lemon into the bird.

Arrange the bird in the turkey roaster.

Place the remaining vegetables and lemon around the roasting pan. Add some fresh thyme.

Brush the remaining fat over the lemon, vegetables and thyme.

Pour the white wine into the bottom of the pan.

Insert a probe thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh.

When you put the lid on the turkey roaster you will notice that the lead wire to the thermometer keeps the lid from making a good seal. Using small pieces of aluminum foil, seal the open edge to be roughly airtight.

Cook until the thermometer reads 160°F-165°F. Rest, tented, for at least 25 minutes before serving. Collect the drippings into a medium pot.

2:15 pm: Prep Potatoes

Peel them and drop them one by one into a pot of water as you do.

When all the potatoes are peeled, fish them out of the water one by one, and cut them into approximately 1” cubes, returning them to the water as you go.

Salt the water heavily and set aside.

3:15 pm: Stuffing

Preheat the oven to 350°F.

In a large skillet, melt the butter and duck fat over medium heat. Add the onion, celery and poultry seasoning (and rosemary if using).

Reduce the temperature to medium low and cook until tender, about 10-12 minutes. Cool slightly.

In a large bowl, combine the bread cubes, onion mixture, parsley and fresh herbs.

Pour the butter / duck fat mixture onto the bread cubes and mix quickly.

Pour 1 cup of broth overtop and toss the cubes. Add the remaining broth, a little bit at a time until cubes are moist (but not soggy) and gently toss. You may not need all of the broth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Place the bread mixture in a baking dish, dot with additional butter if desired, and cover.

Bake 35 minutes, uncover and bake an additional 10 minutes. While your stuffing is in the oven, put your potatoes on high heat.

Remove from oven, and turn the heat down to 200°F, opening the door for a few minutes, to let the heat out.

Return the stuffing to the warm oven, covered loosely.

4:00 pm: Cook Potatoes

Cook the potatoes until done. Drain. Place back in the pot, covered, in a warm oven.

Put the rest of the ingredients for the potatoes into a small pot and work the garlic into the mixture, over a low heat, melting the butter.

Get a large non stick saute pan onto a medium heat and cook the bacon pieces for the brussel sprouts until desired firmness. Leave in the pan, set aside.

Wash, trim and chop your brussel sprouts, leaving then side in a bowl.

5:00 pm: Carrots

In a large saute pan with a tight fitting lid, melt the butter and stir in the spices. Allow to cook for 1 minute.

Mix in the carrots, spreading then as evenly as possible, and coating then all evenly.

Cook, covered, without sitirring, for 45 minutes - 1 hour, depending on your heart and how done you want your carrots.

Keep warm in a warm oven.

While turkey rests: Brussel Sprouts & Gravy

Make the brussel sprouts and gravy at the same time.

Put your pan of bacon and fat back on the stove. Turn the heat onto medium.

When the pan is hot, add your brussel sprouts and press your garlic in. Stir until done. Keep warm in the oven.

Add your pot of turkey drippings to the stove, and turn into a medium heat.

While it heats up, prepare your corn starch slurry and all other gravy ingredients.

Add all Ingredients except the corn starch slurry, and bring to a rapid boil, to reduce until you have reached the desired flavour intensity.

Thicken with a little of the corn starch slurry at a time, until you reach the desired thickness.

Cover the potatoes with the butter mixture and mash together until smooth.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

This build can sustain against the first Raid boss with the use of some consumables.

Using a ""Bobblehead: Repair"" while wearing full Vulcan's power armor and with Power User (3) equipped will negate fusion core drain entirely. With Curator, this would give you two full hours of zero fusion core drain.

Here is a video of the first Raid boss using Scanner's Legendary: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0PJC8Kc4ME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0PJC8Kc4ME)

And here is a video using Rejeuvenator's Legendary: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYS\_eFXgBqQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYS_eFXgBqQ)

Scanner's seems to work better for long, drawn-out fights, although Rejeuvenator's is just as valid but it might require a bit more coffee. Rejeuvenator's is probably better for everyday use, simply because enemies will die fairly quickly and not require long periods of sustained fire in VATS.

Any commentary is welcome. Let me know what you think!
