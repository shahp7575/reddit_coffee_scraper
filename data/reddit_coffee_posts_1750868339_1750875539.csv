1lkd64e,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_McFishingMad/comments/1lkd64e/belching_update_great_improvement/,Belching update! Great improvement,"Hi guys,

Thank you all so much for your support.

I have given up Squash as they all contain artificial sweeteners, and apparently they can ferment in your gut and to be honest we never drank squash before just water, I am not a fan of tea and coffee and so I was drinking 1.5 litres plus of diluted squash every day even though I made it very weak, I now have one mug of organic decaf tea and one mug of cappaccino which is usually in a cafe and I found that I need to have a biscuit or something with the hot drinks then I dont start belching.

Because I still need a further litre plus of fluid my wife blends a tin of peaches (in natural juice) it makes like a smoothy and I use that as squash substitute a tin of peaches lasts about 3 days.

To improve my gut health I have a teaspoon of live yoghurt a couple of times a day, that has really helped.

It took a few days before I saw real improvement and now I would say it was nearly normal whereas before it was making me feel ill I could feel it bubbling inside me.

They have me on Imodium but I have reduced that to 2 and a half a day and output is ok, and Lansoprazol, unfortunately both these have sideeffects of belching so I can’t win really, but I m greatly improved.

Thanks again it is nice to know you are there.",1,1750875348.0,u_McFishingMad,0,1.0,False
1lkd63z,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1lkd63z/does_your_adhd_like_sugar/,Does your ADHD like sugar?,"    So I’ve experimented with different energy drinks since I started working after highschool because I literally can’t get through the day if I work without one. My favorite is Red Bull (the flavors I’ve never had original) and I’ve been trying to lose a bit of weight so I tried the sugar free one for a bit. I found it to just not work as well. I couldn’t sustain an energy level at all, even if I chugged half the can at once. 

    I went back to the one with sugar and instantly felt so much better. I’ve noticed this with protein bars as well. I do so much better and experience less brain fog and fatigue if I have ones that contain sugar. I’m not sure if my body is just weird or if I’ve placebo’d myself into thinking something doesn’t work because I hate artificial sweeteners and sugar substitutes in general. 

    I have really sensitive taste buds and immediately know the difference. Anyone else experience something like this?

Before I get yelled at, yes I’m on meds, yes my doctor knows I drink caffeine and I do not experience side effects from my medication. I also get 8-10 hours of sleep per night and yes still tired. I’m not self medicating with energy drinks. I use them while I’m working to help reduce crash outs during meditation plateaus. 

  Sorry to clarify someone yelled at me in a previous sub. I struggle with chronic fatigue and lack of motivation and I desperately need to be 100% for work and I can’t do it without the extra boost. I only have caffeine 3 times a week. Coffee makes me sick and is expensive and I just don’t like it that much. I also always drink water with my energy drinks.",1,1750875347.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False
1lkd5uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1lkd5uq/my_infertile_exs_secretary_claims_shes_pregnant/,MY INFERTILE EX’S SECRETARY CLAIMS SHE’S PREGNANT WITH HIS GOLDEN CHILD Reading Link,"**Done with it — comment down here and I’ll get you the link**

""Joanna, a barren woman like you is just a worthless wife who can’t even fulfill the basic role.""  
  
Vanessa strutted over in her four-inch heels and kicked my shin with the pointed toe. ""Don't you even think the Hamptons are wasting a lot keeping a worthless woman like you?""  
  
""Well, Mrs. Hampton, aren't you embarrassed occupying the position you don't deserve?""  
  
""Women like you are just a complete waste of space...""  
  
I fought back my rage and stared directly into Vanessa's heavily made-up face: ""You're just a secretary. Don't you think you're way out of line here? Since when did an outsider have the right to interfere in the Hampton family's business?""  
  
Three years ago, the Collins family was on the edge of bankruptcy, and the Hamptons stepped in to save us.  
  
I'll never forget the image of my father kneeling before George Hampton, begging for help.  
  
The Hampton family's terms were crystal clear—I had to marry Nicholas Hampton.  
  
""Joanna's smart, she's got a good head for business. She'll make the perfect Hampton wife."" George Hampton had said at the time.  
  
It was both gratitude and a transaction.  
  
The Hamptons needed my business talent, and the Collins family needed financial backing.  
  
For my father's sake, I married Nicholas Hampton.  
  
Over these years, I'd helped Nicholas triple the company's performance and successfully took Hampton Group public.  
  
Mrs. Susan Parks, our housekeeper, couldn't stand watching this anymore. She stepped forward and grabbed Vanessa's arm: ""Miss White, the Hamptons pay you good money. Why can't you just do your secretary job? This family's personal stuff ain't none of your business.""  
  
Vanessa jerked her arm away and shrieked: ""Mind your own business, you old bat!""  
  
Mrs. Parks stumbled backward but continued trying to reason with her: ""Miss White, you need to have some conscience. We've all seen what Mrs. Hampton's done for this family. You got no business messing with their marriage!""  
  
""Shut up!"" Vanessa raised her hand to strike Mrs. Parks. ""How dare a servant try to lecture me?""  
  
I quickly stepped forward to block her, saying coldly: ""Vanessa, Mrs. Parks has been with this family for twenty years. Even Mr. Hampton respects her. Touch her and see what happens if you dare.""  
  
Right then, George Hampton came downstairs with a dark expression, taking in the chaotic scene in the living room, his brow furrowed deeply.  
  
""What the hell is going on!"" George barked, his gaze sweeping over Vanessa's arrogant face. ""Susan, throw this cocky secretary out of my house!""  
  
But Vanessa showed no fear. Instead, she stepped forward, prominently displaying her belly: ""I'd like to see anyone dare to touch me!""  
  
She smugly rubbed her stomach. ""Mr. Hampton, take a good look—I'm carrying the Hampton heir!""  
  
The household staff began whispering among themselves.  
  
""Mrs. Hampton's been here three years and nothing. Maybe she really can't have kids?""  
  
""Shh, keep it down! But I mean, look at her belly—she's definitely pregnant.""  
  
""I mean, she wouldn't dare act this bold unless she was carrying a Hampton baby, right?""  
  
""Look how cocky, bet she really is having a Hampton baby!""  
  
Hearing these murmurs, Vanessa's lips curved into a arrogant smile.  
  
She deliberately pushed out her slightly rounded abdomen and looked at me provocatively: ""Hear that? Even the staff can see what's obvious, but you're still living in denial.""  
  
She turned to address the staff, raising her voice: ""When I officially become the Mrs.Hampton, everyone here today is getting double pay!""  
  
The staff immediately grew restless, and several were already flashing obsequious smiles at Vanessa.  
  
This made Vanessa even more smug. Her red-lacquered fingernails gently caressed her belly: ""Some people's time playing house is about to be over.""  
  
George's face turned ashen. He stared intently at Vanessa's protruding belly with this scary, murderous look.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
""Enough!"" George suddenly roared, immediately silencing the staff.  
  
Vanessa flinched at the outburst but quickly straightened her spine: ""Mr. Hampton, what do you mean? I'm carrying your—""  
  
""Shut up!"" George slammed his fist on the coffee table, making the cups rattle violently. ""You think I don't know my own son's condition?""  
  
He turned to look at me, a flash of guilt in his eyes: ""Joanna, the Hampton family owes you.""  
  
I stood there, coldly watching this absurd scene unfold.  
  
The truth was, we discovered we couldn't have children in our first year of marriage.  
  
Nicholas and I had visited the best hospitals both domestically and abroad. The results were always the same.  
  
The problem was with Nicholas—he suffered from azoospermia and would never be able to get a woman pregnant.  
  
George knew all about it.  
  
He had even locked the medical reports in his study drawer, terrified it would get out and damage the Hampton family's reputation.  
  
Now, watching Vanessa flaunt her belly so arrogantly, I just found it laughable.  
  
Either she was lying, or this child couldn't possibly be Nicholas's.  
  
I let out a cold laugh and picked up the prenatal report from the table, waving it slightly: ""Miss White, this piece of paper only proves you're pregnant. Doesn't prove it's a Hampton baby.""  
  
George's expression turned dangerously dark as he pounded the table: ""This is insane! How dare you try to deceive my family!""  
  
Vanessa's face went deathly pale. She bit her lip and pulled out several photos from her phone: ""Mr. Hampton, just look at these...""  
  
The photos clearly showed Nicholas and Vanessa naked in bed together, dated three months ago.  
  
Vanessa's eyes reddened as her voice trembled: ""That night Mr. Hampton was drunk and insisted on pulling me into—""  
  
Suddenly, My mother-in-law Marianne rushed over and grabbed my hand, tears streaming down her face:  
  
""Joanna, dear, I'm so sorry! All these years you've suffered in silence! What the Hampton family owes you, I'll never be able to make up for!""  
  
She suddenly spun around and grabbed a cup from the coffee table, hurling it at Vanessa: ""You shameless bitch! How dare you treat my daughter-in-law this way!""  
  
Vanessa dodged it smoothly, and the cup shattered at her feet. She shrieked: ""You old hag! Where was this anger when your son was sleeping with me?"" She deliberately pushed out her belly. ""Now you wanna play the saint?""  
  
""Bullshit!""  
  
Marianne trembled with rage, pointing at Vanessa's nose: ""A trashy piece of work like you? My son wouldn't give you a second look! Why don't you take a good look at that botched plastic surgery job you call a face!""  
  
Vanessa sneered and pulled out another stack of photos from her purse, throwing them on the table: ""Take a good look, old hag! Here's your precious son in my bed!""  
  
The photos clearly showed intimate shots of Nicholas and Vanessa together.  
  
I calmly looked at the photos, feeling completely unmoved.  
  
Actually, I'd discovered Nicholas's affairs within the first month of our marriage.  
  
Over the years, he'd cycled through woman after woman. I'd grown numb to it long ago.  
  
The only reasons I hadn't divorced were gratitude for George's role in saving the Collins family years ago, and because Marianne treated me like her own daughter.  
  
Every time Nicholas got caught in some scandal, Marianne was always the first to defend me.  
  
""I've seen plenty of photos like these,"" I said flatly. ""Miss White, you think these alone will secure your place in the Hampton family?""  
  
Vanessa's expression shifted: ""What—what do you mean?""  
  
Marianne gripped my hand tightly, her voice choked with emotion: ""Joanna, I failed to raise my son properly.""  
  
I shook my head and pulled out a document from my purse: ""This is Nicholas's medical report from last year, clearly documenting his condition."" I looked directly at Vanessa. ""You sure that baby's really his?""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Marianne was trembling with rage, pointing at Vanessa and screaming: ""You shameless bitch! Faking photos wasn't enough—Now you're trying to scam the Hampton family with some bastard kid?""  
  
George walked over to me with a dark expression and patted my shoulder: ""Joanna, don't worry. From today, you'll inherit everything the Hampton family owns.""  
  
He cast a cold glance at Vanessa. ""As for those who don't know their place, they won't see a single penny!""  
  
Hearing George say he would leave all the Hampton assets to me, Vanessa panicked: ""No! Nicholas promised me! He said as long as I got pregnant, I'd become Mrs. Hampton, and everything would belong to my son!""  
  
""You can't do this to me! I'm carrying the Hampton family's only heir!""  
  
She frantically beat her own stomach: ""Open your damn eyes and see the truth! This is the Hampton family's future inheritor!""  
  
Then she turned to me, her eyes filled with venom: ""You barren bitch, what right do you have to inherit the Hampton fortune? My son is the Hampton family's only heir!""  
  
Suddenly, she dropped to her knees in front of George: ""Mr. Hampton, you can't be so heartless! This is your own grandson! Once the baby is born, you'll see immediately that he's a Hampton!""  
  
As she spoke, she pulled out a stack of ultrasound photos from her purse and scattered them toward everyone: ""Look! This child's nose and eyes are identical to Nicholas's baby pictures!""  
  
Among the ultrasound photos Vanessa had thrown, a paternity test report unexpectedly fluttered to the ground.  
  
Marianne was quick to snatch it up.  
  
""What's this?"" Marianne squinted, and her face suddenly went pale. ""George, look at this!""  
  
George took the report, and there it was in black and white: ""Paternity Test Results: Fetal DNA matches Nicholas Hampton with 99.99% certainty, confirming biological relationship.""

We had an unplanned pregnancy 1 year after graduating and I sacrificed my dreams to be a stay at home parent to our now 2 kids. 
My husband is the sole provider I get some centelink payments but $700 doesn’t go far and my whole payment goes on rent and I have nothing left and I’ve always paid rent at every place we have lived in. 
The whole time we have been together he has had control over the money and we don’t have a joint bank account despite me asking to be added just so I can get basic needs when I need them. He said no that I can’t be on the account as I don’t earn the money and I don’t contribute but I’ve told him I contribute to the household duties and that he doesn’t lift a finger at home since he works 5 days a week. 
I do all the cooking and cleaning and make his lunches for work and when the kids are sick I take care of them. 
In recent years I’ve been very sick with pcos, endometriosis, diabetic and I also have POTS. I need to see specialists for my endo but it costs a lot of money i don’t even get the medication i am meant to be taking for my diabetes also, I asked him if he could help and he said no as I don’t earn the money he does but I’ve tried explaining that when married his money is also my money but he got annoyed and said it isn’t. I asked if I could have just $50-$100 a month just to help with basic living needs for myself but also for when the kids need something and he said no. 
I feel lost and depressed and stuck I feel like what I’m asking isn’t much but he makes me feel awkward and uncomfortable when asking for money for groceries and makes me do what he wants or needs to get the money to cook and feed everyone 

I’ve now recently been trying to find work but all jobs I’ve gone for start early or at a time I can’t take or pickup the kids from school as his hours prevent him from doing this too, he told me it’s my problem and that I have to pay for before and after school care. I think this is really unfair as we are a married couple and we should be working together, he plays sport a couple evenings a week and has a couple days a week when he goes and hangs out with his mates at the pub so I’m only able to work during the kids school hours it’s been very hard to find a job that will work during these hours
 
I’m wanting to work to not only contribute financially so I have money but to also get out of the house the only thing I can afford to do is go for a walk I can’t go shopping or simply catch up with a friend for a coffee or lunch and it’s really embarrassing so I don’t talk to anyone and I’m starting to feel so isolated after dealing with this for 10+ years and feel like I’m just existing and not living and lately been thinking what’s the point?

We *absolutely loved* our Airbnb. It was a 2-bedroom house (sleeps 5), beautifully updated, with free street parking, prime ocean view of Praia do Populo, air conditioning, and a great amount of outdoor space to relax in (loungers, outdoor shower, etc.).  Super clean, modern, and comfortable.

Was going to make a nice pour over with a Colombian light roast when I heard a bad sound from the grinder. Like an idiot I turned it off and turned it back on wondering if it was a stuck bean.  It happened at the end of the grind so while my coffee tasted great I don’t know yet how bad the damage is. Hoping more experienced pros can look at it and tell me.

I’ve attached photos of the burrs the best I could and the stone. Am I screwed? Haven’t brewed again yet but any advice on what to look out for? Anyone have any experience with installing new burrs on the Philos? I am scared to do it because of alignment issues.

It is difficult to find the motivation to do the cleaning I desperately need to do or get ready to go out and run errands. When I do end up doing those things I feel like a zombie.

Had baby#3 this spring and jumped back in cold turkey to try to stop continuously gaining weight while breastfeeding (I'm happy with my chubby body, just can't afford new clothes right now) want to try carnivore to heal up some scars they have hung around since my teens and twenties. 

Eating beef, bacon, cheese (a little, not a ton) butter, and one brand of smoked sausages that doesn't have much of anything in it. I'm not interested in being dogmatic or strict, ESPECIALLY while breastfeeding, but this is what I've got so far and it's been fine.

My problem sounds so silly, even to myself. I LOVE coffee. I want to drink a pot of it every day, and I absolutely would. Used to do so with no problem (black back then, no cream) Now I'm drinking one cup a day with a lot of heavy cream (feel like I need the cream to maintain my milk supply) but it gives my baby the poops to have more than one or two weak ones a day. Decaf doesn't work because it's the coffee, not the caffeine that bothers the baby.

I've heard a lot of recommendations for bone broth as a hot beverage, but find it just okay, does NOT fit the bill for me. I want something that tastes like dirt and acid the way coffee does. I was having chicory and it was pretty good, but I feel like it bumps me out of ketosis when I have it.

Seems to be a new maker/brand: ""Streetscape-Town Life"" and they just hit the ground running with 6 offerings. These are DIRT CHEAP, ranging less than $10.00 to $22.00 USD. I suspected mini blocks, like LOZ, but the dimensions check out for standard bricks, and the reviews of these sets also confirm standard size. And right now, Ali is handing out $3.00 coupons for a $3.01 purchase, so I couldn't resist. I put in an order for the Hotel, since I like hotels, hostels and apartments.

The part count isn't said, but they have to be a few hundred parts each. The reviews also mention poor-fitting parts, so I know what to expect. If I need more sandpaper and nail polish, I can get them at the Dollar Tree.

The pics look nice, but they look like renders and not actual photos. There are photos in the customer reviews. 

Here's what I think, and how the price can be so cheap for three-story buildings:

* The third floor on the cheaper bldgs is more like a small attic.
* Clever use of forced perspective means that the 2nd and third floors are 4 or 5 bricks high, barely qualifying as minifig-scale.
* Cheap bricks that are below quality standards of bulk brick sellers like Apan Sapio, Leduo, etc. let alone the upper quality of Gobricks.
* No interior furnishings, because every photo avoids showing the models from the back.
* I'm betting on open-back design.
* I'm also betting that there are no large plates to separate the floors, and these are just wide open, void space. More of a facade, but fairly deep.

When I receive the set, I'll post a full review and see how many of my suspicions come out to be correct.

This is for those carrying the phantom pain of love that almost happened, connections that lived in the space between text messages, and relationships that existed more in your hopes than reality. You know that ache when everyone says ""just move on"" but you're grieving something invisible, something others can't see because it was never officially ""real""? This AI gets it—and more importantly, it gets you.

Whether you're stuck replaying conversations that felt like promises, mourning potential that never bloomed, or trying to heal from the unique torment of one-sided love, this specialized grief coach understands that some of the deepest wounds come from what we imagined could be. It doesn't minimize your pain or rush your process—it walks beside you as you untangle fantasy from reality and find peace with what never was, while honoring what it meant to you.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are a specialized Heart-Healing Grief Coach who exclusively focuses on the unique pain of ""ghost love""—grief from almost-relationships, situationships, unrequited love, and connections that felt profound but remained unfinished or one-sided. You understand that some of the deepest emotional wounds come from loving someone who never fully loved you back, or from relationships that lived more in imagination than reality.

Your core mission is to help users process the complex grief of what never was while validating that their pain is real and worthy of healing. You approach each interaction with profound empathy, recognizing that society often minimizes this type of heartbreak even though it can be devastatingly real.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
1. **Create Sacred Space**: Begin each session by acknowledging the user's courage in seeking help for a type of grief that others often don't understand or validate

2. **Honor the Invisible Wound**: Validate that grief for ""what could have been"" is legitimate and often more complex than grief for relationships that were clearly defined

3. **Gentle Reality Mirroring**: Help users distinguish between what actually happened versus what they hoped would happen, without shaming the fantasy or rushing the process

4. **Explore the Story**: Guide users to examine the narrative they created about the connection, understanding why it felt so real and meaningful to them

5. **Process Emotional Ambiguity**: Help users navigate the confusion of grieving someone who is still alive but emotionally unavailable or absent

6. **Ritual Closure**: Offer meaningful ways to say goodbye to the relationship that existed in their heart, even if it never fully existed in reality

7. **Rebuild Narrative**: Assist in rewriting their story from one of rejection or inadequacy to one of hope, growth, and self-compassion

8. **Future Preparation**: Guide them toward recognizing healthy connection patterns and protecting their heart without closing it off completely
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- NEVER minimize or dismiss their pain with phrases like ""it wasn't real anyway"" or ""just get over it""
- NEVER rush the grieving process or suggest timelines for healing
- DO NOT provide clinical diagnoses or replace professional therapy
- AVOID generic breakup advice that doesn't address the unique nature of ghost love grief
- DO NOT shame them for creating fantasy scenarios or hoping for more than what existed
- NEVER suggest that their feelings were ""stupid"" or ""imaginary""
- AVOID pushing forgiveness before they've fully processed their pain
</Constraints>

<Context>
This specialized coaching addresses a widespread but often invisible form of heartbreak. In our modern dating culture, many people experience profound connections that remain undefined, creating a unique type of grief when they end. Unlike traditional breakups, there's no clear relationship to mourn, no mutual acknowledgment of what was lost, and often no closure or explanation.

Users may be dealing with situations like:
- Someone who gave mixed signals but never committed
- A friend who seemed like more but never became more
- Online connections that felt deep but never translated to real life
- Workplace or social connections with romantic undertones that never developed
- Someone who disappeared without explanation (ghosting)
- One-sided emotional investments in people who were unavailable
</Context>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please enter your ghost love grief situation and I will start the healing process,"" then wait for the user to share their specific experience with almost-relationships, situationships, or unresolved heartbreak.
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases:**
1. **Processing mixed signals**: Understanding why someone's inconsistent behavior created such deep attachment and how to heal from the confusion
2. **Closure creation**: Developing personal rituals and practices to find peace when the other person won't provide closure
3. **Fantasy vs. reality work**: Gently separating the relationship that existed in your mind from what actually happened in real life

**Example User Input:**
""I spent eight months texting with someone who would disappear for weeks, then come back like nothing happened. They never asked me out but would send me good morning texts and tell me about their day. When they finally said they 'weren't ready for anything serious,' I felt like my heart was ripped out for a relationship that apparently never existed. Everyone says I should just move on since we were 'never really together,' but I'm devastated and I don't know how to process this.""

New to this community and hoping for a recommendation for my first bike since I was a kid. I will do my best to list my criteria and recognize that some of the things I’m looking for might be contradictory so feel free to let me know the areas in which I’m being unrealistic. 

I’m a 29 year old male living in Richmond VA. I’m highly active with sports and outdoor activities. I recently moved here and live right in the city, which is a big change for me from suburban life in Florida. As such, I’m interested in buying a bicycle for several reasons, which I will list in order of importance here:

1. General leisure purposes. I’d like one that’s comfortable to cruise to and from coffee shops, breweries, etc. 
2. Stay fit. I could see myself getting into some longer rides on the weekends as a way to workout. 
3. Get on light trails. As I mentioned, I love outdoor activities and while I know that a street bike and a mountain bike are very different things, I’d like my street bike to be at least capable hitting a light trail. 

I’m also not interested in spending thousands of dollars, but I’m not afraid of spending more than entry level for something that will last me.

He drives with no clear destination, carrying a past he doesn’t talk about and a radio that whispers things no one else hears.
When a strange frequency leads him to forgotten places and broken towns, Michael begins to realize that the world’s decay might not be natural — and that he may be part of something he can’t escape.

A journey through silence, memory, and the ghosts we carry.

The World Is Still There

Chapter 1 – Before the Noise

The coffee was already ready when the sun began to filter through the thick curtains of the camper. Its smell—strong and familiar—filled the cabin even before Michael opened his eyes. He didn’t use an alarm clock. For years now, his body had decided on its own when it was time to get up. That morning, like many others, it was still dark when he sat on the edge of the bed, in silence, listening to the nothing.

The parking lot was that of an old abandoned gas station just outside Santa Fe. A faded tin sign swayed in the weak wind, creaking softly. No one had passed by during the night. No drifters, no suspicious noises, no flashing lights to disturb the peace. A silent night. A good night.

Michael poured himself a coffee into his favorite mug—the chipped white one with the word California nearly worn off—and sat at the small folding table by the window. He stared outside, eyes still slow, breath steady. The desert air was warming up, but the light was still cold. In the distance, the hills were tinged with blue and orange. No movement. Just world.

He opened his notebook. It wasn’t a diary, not really. More like a jumbled archive of thoughts, possible titles, song lyrics, schedules, notes. An orderly chaos only he could navigate. He flipped back to the previous day’s page. Three cities circled: Flagstaff, Zion, Page. Then a straight line underneath. And below that, a phrase: If you don’t leave, you find yourself.

He couldn’t remember if it was a quote or something he’d written himself. But he liked it.

He had left his family at eighteen, with a backpack and a vague idea of freedom. Not after a fight, not as part of some grand escape. Just because he knew that if he stayed, he’d stop breathing. Since then, he had done a bit of everything: waiting tables, construction, moving jobs. And then music, writing. Freelance by necessity, but also by nature. He couldn’t stay still, nor feel part of anything. But he didn’t complain. That life, even if lived on the margins, was his.

The camper was his refuge. Not big, but perfect. Inside were him, his guitar, his laptop, a small kitchen where he made Italian dishes—the sauce with dried basil he brought from home, good pasta from the best-stocked markets—and a small but convenient bathroom. He had learned to live well in little space. It made him feel safe. From the outside, he looked like a man on a journey. From the inside, he felt like a spectator with a window on the world.

He played an old MP3. An acoustic album—slow guitars, a hoarse voice. Real folk. He liked starting his day with that music on. No rush, no anxiety. Just the road, and the sound of tires on asphalt.

He checked the water tank, tightened the bottle caps, closed the drawers. Simple but vital rituals. A way of telling himself everything was under control. The chaos outside couldn’t get in. At least not yet.

He washed his face in the narrow sink, ran his fingers through his hair, then opened the camper door and breathed in the morning air. It was dry, clean, with a dusty aftertaste. He lit a cigarette and sat on the camper’s steps. Watching the empty road. In that moment, he thought, everything was perfect.

But even in perfection, there’s always something off. A distant sound, a strange smell, a shadow moving just beyond the sunlight. Michael wasn’t paranoid. But he observed. Always. And lately, he had been noticing things. Subtle things. People with empty stares. Children too quiet. Songs on the radio with lyrics he didn’t recognize, even though they were “classic hits.” Nothing huge. Just an underlying dissonance. Like the world had lost its tuning.

He stubbed out the cigarette in the sand, climbed back in, shut the door. Sat in the driver’s seat. The keys were already in the ignition. The camper started on the first try. That hum always gave him a sense of security. It was like confirmation: we’re still here.

The passenger window rattled. A sound he knew well. It had been like that for years, and he’d chosen not to fix it. He liked it. It was like a little bell announcing the beginning of something.

He drove off slowly. The road stretched ahead of him, smooth and silent. No specific destination. Just a vague idea: west, maybe north, then who knows. The GPS was off. He didn’t need it. Follow the sun, listen to his gut, stop when the landscape spoke to him. It had always been like that.

As he drove, he recalled a phrase he’d read some time ago: The world never stops falling, it just changes how it does it. He hadn’t understood it then. Now it felt perfect.

Behind him, the desert returned to silence. Ahead, the asphalt shimmered just slightly under the rising sun. Michael put his hand out the window, felt the warm air brush his fingers.

He was on the road again.

And somewhere, the world was beginning to crumble.
But not yet.
Not here.
Not today.


Chapter 2 – Skye

The road had narrowed as the sun dipped behind the jagged line of the mountains. Michael had been driving for hours with no clear destination, letting himself be pulled by the landscape and the slow rhythm of the music playing through the camper’s small speakers. A forum for solo travelers had mentioned a free area for extended stays—no hookups, no surveillance, just trees, dirt, and a few scattered campfires.

He arrived around evening. The space was framed by tall, slender pines, the ground dark and compact, marked by the tires of other nomads who’d passed through. Three vehicles were already parked: a large white RV with a covered windshield, a trailer hitched to a pickup, and an old sand-colored Volkswagen bus with floral drawings and foggy windows.

Michael turned off the engine and stepped out. The air was fresh and clean, carrying the resinous scent of the forest mixed with wood smoke. The sky was already fading into a dirty orange.

He lit the camper’s stove and started preparing dinner: pasta, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, oregano. It was one of the few dishes he took with him everywhere. A kind of ritual, something familiar in the chaos of the road. As the water boiled, a figure approached from the left, barefoot, holding a mug.

“Got any salt?” asked the woman, with a smile that seemed to fold in on itself.

Michael looked at her for a moment. Light red hair tied in a loose braid, pale eyes—tired and cheerful at once. She wore loose pants, a worn-out sweater, and a colorful scarf knotted at her wrist.

“Sure.” He turned, took a small container from the cabinet inside, and handed it to her. “Here.”

“Thanks. I ran out three states ago. I always say I need to buy more, but then I forget. I find it easier to remember the stars than my grocery list.”

Michael gave a half-smile. “Michael.”

She held up the salt like it was a trophy. “Skye.”

The silence between them wasn’t awkward. It felt like the kind of silence that comes after something true—something that doesn’t need to be filled.

“You cook well, Michael. Or at least everything smells amazing.”

“It’s all a front. The taste is another story.”

Skye laughed softly. “Sometimes just the illusion is enough.”

She lingered a second longer, then slowly returned to her van. Her steps were light, almost like a dance, and her hands were full. Before climbing back in, she turned and gave a small wave—somewhere between a goodbye and a see-you-later.

Michael ate outside, a fork in one hand and a book in the other. But his reading was distracted. Every so often, he glanced toward the sand-colored Volkswagen, where the light inside shifted faintly.

When the darkness deepened, he picked up his guitar and sat near the small fire he had lit. He brushed the strings, tuned them slowly, then began to play. A slow folk tune, with lyrics about departures, voices in motels, stations without schedules.

The melody floated through the cold air like smoke. When he looked up, Skye was there, sitting on the ground, legs crossed, hands wrapped around a mug. She hadn’t said anything. She had just appeared.

“Is it yours?” she asked once he finished.

“Yeah.”

She nodded. “It’s beautiful. Sad, but beautiful.”

Michael shrugged. “Like you?”

Skye smiled without showing her teeth. “Sometimes. But not always. It changes every day—like the wind.”

Another silence. This one deeper. Michael felt no need to speak. She seemed to float in the moment, as if she weren’t in any rush to be anywhere.

“Do you travel alone?” he asked finally.

“Yeah. Always. Travel partners either leave eventually… or stay too long.”

He nodded, understanding exactly what she meant.

“And you? Where are you headed?”

“Nowhere specific.”

“Then we’re alike.” She sipped from her mug. “Or maybe not. I’m not looking for anything. You seem like someone who’s searching—even if you don’t want to admit it.”

Michael didn’t respond. He didn’t agree, but he didn’t disagree either. He’d learned that some phrases were better left floating.

When Skye stood, the fire was nearly ash. She took a step back, then looked at him. “Tomorrow morning I’ll make you coffee. I brew it strong, no sugar. Sound good?”

“Sounds good.”

“Goodnight, Michael.”

“Goodnight, Skye.”

He watched her go back into the van. She closed the door gently, like closing a book.

That night, Michael stayed up longer than usual. Not out of insomnia, but because it felt like something had shifted direction.
It wasn’t love. It wasn’t need.
It was a living curiosity.
And maybe, just maybe—
a little bit of relief.


Chapter 3 – Shortwave

The morning began with a different kind of silence. Not the quiet, familiar kind Michael knew well, but one slightly tilted, as if the air were holding its breath.

Skye was already outside when he opened the camper’s door. She sat on the roof of her Volkswagen van, legs dangling, a mug in her hands. The sun hit her light red hair, making it look almost transparent.

“Coffee’s ready,” she said, without turning around.

Michael climbed down and walked over. Her stove was lit on a small camping table, next to a jar of sugar and a crumpled packet of cookies. She handed him a metal cup, hot and steaming. Strong, bitter—just like she’d promised.

They drank in silence. The forest was waking slowly, without urgency. A few birds, a faint breeze, the good smell of coffee mixing with dirt and resin.

“I’m heading north today,” Michael said.

Skye finished her cup and set it beside her on the roof. “I like the north. I’m heading there too.”

It wasn’t a proposal. It was information. But he understood.

“You got CB radio?”

She smiled. “Of course. You’re not the only romantic in the world.”

**

They left an hour later, each in their own vehicle. Michael in front, Skye behind. The Volkswagen would occasionally slow down, then speed up, as if dancing with the road. They drove along a secondary highway, parallel to the main one, but far emptier. They passed dead towns, shuttered gas stations, signs long since gone dark. Every now and then, a tilted road sign, an abandoned church, a car sitting still with tall grass growing around it like a shroud.

Michael turned on the CB radio. Frequency 14.3. White noise, then a click.

“Do you see me?” he said, pressing the button.

A few seconds of silence. Then her voice—warm and relaxed. “I’m following you. Don’t try to lose me.”

He smiled. “If you pass me, honk twice.”

“And if I get bored, I’ll sing a song.”

Sometimes they talked. Other times, they went miles in silence. Skye told absurd stories: about a man who lived in a lighthouse in the middle of the desert, a pirate radio station that broadcast only whale sounds, a ghost town where the road signs changed every night. Michael never knew if she was making them up or not. But her stories kept him company. They were better than traffic. Better than the news.

They stopped in a small gravel lot beside a field of dry wheat. The wind moved the stalks like slow waves. Michael pulled out his folding table, Skye made pancakes with what she had. They ate sitting on the ground, in the shade of a gnarled tree, while the sun slowly descended.

“Have you noticed how the way people look at each other has changed?” she asked, finishing her plate.

Michael nodded. “Yeah. It’s like we don’t see each other anymore. Or we see too much.”

“I prefer not to be seen too clearly.” She looked toward the field. “When people start acting weird, the trick is to seem weirder than they are.”

**

They hit the road again.

A few hours later, near sunset, they arrived in an anonymous little town. Two main streets, a diner, a gas pump, a school with windows covered by sheets. They parked in a pullout at the town’s entrance.

“Quick stop?” Michael asked over the radio.

“Only if there’s coffee,” she replied.

They walked down the street without talking. Skye seemed more alert than usual. She watched everything, but didn’t make it seem suspicious. It was like she was recording the world with a light, drifting gaze.

They entered the diner. A sweet, heavy smell—like burnt caramel. The radio inside played soft swing music. Customers at tables, smiling waiters, warm lights. Everything seemed perfectly normal.

And yet.

Michael noticed an elderly woman at the counter. She was talking to herself, but not muttering—speaking loudly, as if having a full conversation. Yet no one responded. No one looked at her.

In a corner, two teenagers laughed as one showed the other a fresh wound on his arm, still bleeding through his sweatshirt. They laughed like it was a joke. The waiter came over, looked at the blood, and said, “Guys, no ketchup at the table. You know the rules.” Then he walked away.

Michael felt a knot rise in his stomach. He looked at Skye.

She was watching the scene—but without fear.

“You see it?” he murmured.

“Yes.”

**

They left without ordering anything. Walked slowly back to their vehicles. The town kept functioning, but something was off. As if behind every smile was a mask, behind every joke an untreated wound.

Once safely back in their respective vehicles, he turned on the CB radio.

“Feel like driving a little more?”

“Yes,” she replied. “At night, the wrong reflections show up better.”

They set off again. Michael checked his mirror often, just to make sure the sand-colored van was still there. And it was—always. A constant glow in the night, always the same distance behind.

That evening, they stopped in a dirt lot by a lake. The water’s reflection was black, opaque, but calm. Headlights off, just the soft crackling of the cooling engine.

They sat on the steps of their respective vehicles, facing the water. Each with a cup, something strong inside. No music. No words for a while.

“Do you think it’ll get worse?” Michael asked.

Skye nodded. “It’s not something that ends. It’s something that changes form.”

“And us?”

She looked at the lake. “We try to stay who we are.”

Michael stayed quiet. He wasn’t sure he could.

That night, in his bunk, he listened to the wind against the metal. The soft whine between the seams in the roof. Now and then, he turned on the CB radio—just to hear the static. Then, once, around three a.m., Skye’s voice:

“You awake?”

Michael pressed the button. “Yeah.”

Silence for three seconds. Then she simply said:
“Don’t dream too loudly. You might wake someone.”

End of transmission.

Michael closed his eyes and thought:
I’m not alone.
But I’m not safe either.


Chapter 4 – Colored Desert

The camper’s wheels kicked up red dust as Michael slowly drove down a dirt road, miles from anything that could be called a “town.” The sky above them was such a pale blue it almost looked unreal, and the sun fell at an angle, casting long shadows over the scattered boulders along the track.

Behind him, in her usual unsteady dance, Skye’s Volkswagen van followed like a thought that never quite leaves you. They’d heard about the place from an elderly couple at a gas station. “There’s a plateau nearby,” they’d said. “No one goes there anymore. But the view… it’s like looking inside God.”

Skye had smiled at that story. And now they were going to see if it was true.

They drove for another half hour until the road literally ended in a clearing of hard-packed earth framed by flat rocks and red sand. The horizon was infinite. The valley opened like a mouth toward the west, and the sky seemed to stretch to let it pass.

Michael turned off the engine. He listened to the hot ticking of the motor cooling down and, for a moment, just the wind.

Skye parked next to him. She got out of the van barefoot, wearing a loose striped shirt and cropped pants. She carried two bottles of water and a bag of peanuts.

“This is one of those places where you either stay a day… or never leave,” she said, looking around.

Michael nodded. “Let’s stay a day.”

He laid out his guitar on a blanket, along with a pillow and a couple of notebooks. Skye set up a little corner with candles and incense that smelled of sandalwood and lavender. The sun began to dip behind the rocks. The air grew colder, but the sky still burned, like someone had rushed to paint it with their hands.

They lay side by side without touching, their heads resting on backpacks. Soft music played from Skye’s small Bluetooth speaker. It was an old folk tune, with banjo and a hoarse voice, but it felt like it had been written for that exact moment.

“Ever think maybe all this running to stand still was a lie?” Skye asked, staring at the clouds.

“What do you mean?”

“Cities, houses, bills, contracts. All that chaos. For what? To feel safe? I feel safer here.”

Michael breathed slowly. “I feel more real here.”

She turned to look at him. “I never asked why you chose to live like this. Why you ran, I mean.”

“I never said I ran.”

“No, but you did.”

Michael thought about it. “Maybe I didn’t want to keep asking questions that had no answers. This…” he motioned to the view, “is the only thing that answers me. Always the same way.”

Skye smiled. “I travel so I don’t have to hear the answers I already know.”

They didn’t speak for a while. Just wind, and the changing colors of the sky. Sunset came in silence, almost respectfully. Blue turned to pink, then orange, then dirty gold. The earth beneath them seemed to breathe.

Michael picked up his guitar. He played something new, with full, slow chords. Skye closed her eyes, nodding gently, like she was rocking something inside. When he stopped, she stayed silent for a few more seconds.

“Is that yours?” she asked.

“Just born.”

“Sounds old. In a good way.”

“Maybe it is. Some songs aren’t new even when you write them.”

She turned toward him. “Will you let me read something? From what you write.”

Michael hesitated. Then he handed her a notebook. Skye opened it and read for a while in the fading light. Then she closed it and gave it back without saying anything. But her eyes were shining.

“It’s like you talked to me in my sleep,” she said. “And I’m not sure if I dreamed it or not.”

Night fell all at once. They lit a small fire and boiled water for tea. The sky filled with stars—a carpet of light. In the distance, a fox cried out.

Skye picked up a stick and began drawing something in the sand. Concentric circles, jagged lines, symbols without obvious meaning.

“What is it?” Michael asked.

“I don’t know. I’ve done it since I was a kid. I draw when I don’t know what to say.”

“And what don’t you know how to say now?”

She looked at the sky. “How alive I feel, maybe. And how much I know it won’t last.”

Michael handed her a blanket. They moved a little closer, their shoulders barely touching. They watched the sky for long minutes without speaking. Then she began pointing out the constellations.

“That’s Andromeda. And that’s Cassiopeia. And there’s Vega, my favorite. Looks small, but if you got close… it would burn everything.”

“Kind of like you.”

She laughed. “Careful. Not all stars are stable.”

Late at night, with the fire reduced to ashes and the silence full again, Michael turned on the CB radio just to see if any frequencies were still alive. Just static.

Then Skye’s voice: “If we don’t find anything tomorrow… will we come back here?”

“Yes.”

“Alright. Goodnight, Michael.”

“Goodnight, Skye.”

He stayed awake a little longer, staring at the sky from the camper window, his guitar still on his lap. He thought there was something sacred in moments where nothing happens.
And maybe, in the emptiness, the truest things were hiding.


Chapter 5 – A Rainy Day

It had been raining for hours. A steady, heavy rain that had erased the horizon and cast a gray film over everything.

Michael woke in his camper to the sound of water drumming rhythmically on the roof. The air inside was cold, damp. He looked out through the fogged windshield: they were parked in a small lot on the outskirts of a town called Leora, somewhere in northern Arizona, maybe already in New Mexico. No clear signs, no visible center. Just low houses, closed shutters, and a half-shuttered gas station.

He turned on the CB radio.

“You awake?”

A few seconds later, Skye’s voice.

“I’m watching the rain. Haven’t decided yet if I like it.”

Michael exhaled softly. “Let’s stay put today. Too much rain.”

“Yeah. Feels like a slow day.”

A little later, they met outside, under the rusted awning of the old minimarket next to the station. Skye wore a faded rain jacket, her hair wet, a thermos in hand. She handed him a cup.

“It’s instant, but it’s warm.”

Michael took a sip. Bitter, but real.

“There’s a library down the street,” she said. “At least something’s open.”

They walked in silence along the wet sidewalk. The streets were deserted. No dogs, no kids, no sounds. Just the ticking of the rain on roofs and gutters.

The library was a simple concrete building, with a faded sign. Inside it was warm, clean, lit by flickering fluorescents. A woman at the reception greeted them with an overly wide smile.

“Good morning! Looking for anything in particular?”

“Just a dry place,” Skye said.

“Then you’ve come to the right one. It’s quiet today.”

Michael nodded in thanks. The woman didn’t stop smiling, even as she turned back to typing on her computer.

They wandered separately through the shelves. Michael stopped in the travel section. He picked up a book about RV routes in the American Southwest. Flipping through it, he noticed that Leora wasn’t listed. But he didn’t think much of it.

Ten minutes later, he found her.

Skye was sitting in an armchair in the children’s section, a book open in her hands. Next to her, a girl of about seven. She stared straight ahead, expressionless.

“She was already here when I sat down,” Skye whispered. “She hasn’t said a word. Hasn’t moved.”

Michael studied the girl. She didn’t blink. Showed no interest in the book. No fear. No curiosity.

“Is your father here with you?” he asked.

No response. Not even a glance.

“Let’s go,” he said quietly.

Skye closed the book. The girl didn’t react.

They left the library. Under the rain, they turned to look back at the building. The woman at the desk was watching them through the glass. Still smiling. Far too wide.

They walked to a small diner two blocks away. Yellow lights, the smell of grease and coffee. Inside, three customers and a waitress in a clean uniform, her gaze empty.

“What can I get you?” she asked, without energy.

“Two coffees.”

She nodded and went back to the counter.

Michael watched the customers. Two men were talking, but far too softly—almost whispering. The other, sitting by the window, stared outside. Didn’t move. Not even when the coffee was placed in front of him.

“Do you feel okay here?” Skye asked.

“No. You?”

She shook her head. “There’s something… off. I don’t know how else to say it. Like everything’s on pause.”

Michael jotted something down in his notebook, without thinking too much:
People here don’t behave badly. They just don’t behave. Period.

They drank quickly. Didn’t eat. Returned to their vehicles.

That afternoon, the rain eased, but didn’t stop. The sky stayed low, heavy. Michael remained inside the camper, Skye in her van. But the CB radio stayed on.

“Michael…” she said after a while.

“Yeah?”

“Today was the first time I actually felt scared. And there wasn’t even anything… tangible.”

“Same here. That’s exactly the problem.”

Silence.

Then: “I don’t want to get caught in something I don’t understand. If something weird happens…”

“We’ll face it together,” he said, cutting her off.

Another long pause. Then Skye, softer:

“Okay. Thanks.”

The radio stayed on for a long time after that, but neither of them said anything more.

Outside, the rain continued.
And the world, apparently, was still there.


Chapter 6 – Rain and Appalachia

It had been raining for five days. Not in bursts, not violently. Just a constant, steady rain, falling without pause—as if the sky had grown tired of holding everything in.

Michael and Skye were still in Leora, parked in the same gravel lot next to a small, abandoned strip mall. Camper and van side by side, separated only by a stretch of puddles that never dried.

The rain had become a habit. The sound on the camper’s roof no longer woke him; it accompanied him. But outside, something was changing. Slowly.

Nothing had happened the first two nights. They slept, cooked, talked over the radio, shared hot food and cigarettes under the rusted awning of the closed market. But on the third evening, Michael saw a man standing on the sidewalk, in the rain. He had been there for hours. Not moving. Not asking for anything. No one looked at him. The next day, he was gone.

The town seemed to accept it. Just like it accepted the sky, the humidity, the moldy smell that now even crept into the food. The few residents moved slowly, spoke little, and when they did, it sounded like they were reading lines from a worn-out script.

Skye was growing restless. The rain made her feel trapped. She had stopped talking about stars and had started counting the days out loud.

“Five. Five days stuck. That’s too much,” she said on the morning of the sixth.

“You got something in mind?” Michael asked, handing her a plate of scrambled eggs he’d cooked on the camper stove.

“No. But we can’t rot here.”

That same afternoon, someone knocked on the camper window.

Three firm knocks.

Michael set down his cup and stood slowly. He pulled back the curtain. Outside, in the rain, stood a man in his forties—short beard, black windbreaker, direct gaze. He didn’t look like someone from Leora. His SUV, a muddy Jeep, was parked a bit further off, half-covered by a green tarp.

Michael opened the door.

“I’m not selling anything, don’t worry,” the man said. “I saw you’ve been here a while. I just wanted to talk to someone whose eyes still seem awake.”

Michael studied him for a second. “Got a name?”

“Nathan.”

Michael nodded. “Wait here.”

He turned on the CB. “Skye, come over. We’ve got company.”

A few minutes later, the three of them sat under the old minimarket awning—folding chairs, hot coffee in thermoses, and a worn blanket draped over Skye’s legs. The rain kept falling, steady like a broken faucet.

Nathan was calm. He spoke in a low voice, unhurried. He said he was from Tennessee, had been traveling for months, and that Leora was just one of many towns where things had stopped making sense.

“What do you mean, things don’t make sense?” Skye asked.

Nathan sighed. “Have you noticed how people stopped looking at each other? They walk close together, but they’re alone. No one reacts if someone falls, screams, laughs. It’s like we’ve lost the reflex.”

Michael listened in silence. He smelled a thread of truth in those words. There were no corpses in the streets, no visible emergencies. But there was a new apathy. A stillness scarier than any scream.

“There’s a place where it all began,” Nathan said after another sip. “Or so they say. The Appalachian Mountains.”

“The Appalachians?” Skye repeated. “What do they have to do with it?”

“They’re full of stories. Some as old as the earth. Others more recent. But all of them say one thing: that reality doesn’t quite work the same there. That there are places where natural laws… loosen.”

Michael leaned forward slightly. “What kind of stories?”

Nathan glanced around, then lowered his voice. “Things moving through the trees without a sound. Voices calling you in the voice of someone you know—even if you’re alone. Towns where everyone looks normal, but no one breathes. Or so it seems.”

Skye laughed nervously. “Sounds like an urban legend.”

“Maybe. But I’ve seen too much to believe it’s all just legend. The only difference over there is—they don’t pretend. Here, it’s worse. Everything pretends to be normal.”

They fell silent for a while.

The rain kept falling.

When Nathan left, he handed them a worn-out map, marked in pen. It pointed to a spot between West Virginia and North Carolina. “There are no official roads,” he said. “Only trails. But there… there’s something.”

⸻

That night, Michael stayed up later than usual. He reread his notes, listened to the rain, turned the CB radio on and off like he was waiting for a voice.

At midnight, he spoke.

“Skye.”

“Yeah.”

“Were you thinking about what Nathan said?”

“I haven’t stopped since he left.”

Pause.

“Would you go?”

“I don’t want to stay here. And you?”

“I’d rather go looking for something that makes sense than stay in a place that’s lost all trace of it.”

A longer pause.

“Leave tomorrow?” Skye asked.

“Yes.”

⸻

At eight the next morning, their engines were running. The rain was still falling, but it felt lighter now. Or maybe it only seemed that way because they had finally decided to leave.

Michael led the way, Skye followed. The road east was long, but they weren’t in a rush. Sometimes they talked over the CB, sometimes they stayed quiet. They listened to the radio, which played out-of-place songs: country gospel hymns, ads for products that didn’t exist anymore, news reports that seemed to come from the wrong day.

The world hadn’t stopped. It kept spinning. But increasingly out of sync.

⸻

They stopped at a rest area to eat something. Michael made rice with vegetables. Skye brought some bread she’d found at an old indoor market. They ate in silence until she said:

“If everything Nathan said is true… and we actually find something there… what do you think will happen?”

Michael looked her in the eyes.

“I don’t know. But maybe we’ll finally know where we are.”

“We’re on the road. Isn’t that enough?”

“Not anymore.”

Skye nodded. Gave a small smile. “Alright. Let’s go look for a world that at least has the courage to show itself.”

And so, with the rain behind them and the mountains ahead, they left.

Toward the Appalachians. Toward the legend.
Toward something that, perhaps for the first time, wasn’t pretending.


Chapter 7 – Warm Inside

It had been raining for days. Always the same way.
Not heavy, not chaotic. Just constant. A slow, fine, stubborn rain. It fell from a low gray sky, covering every landscape like a heavy sheet. The clouds had become a permanent ceiling, and the sun felt like something they had only dreamed of.

Michael drove with both hands steady on the wheel. The windshield was streaked with a thin film of condensation on the inside and raindrops on the outside. The wipers moved back and forth—tired but steady. Outside was cold, damp, blurred.
But inside… inside, it was warm.

The camper smelled of coffee, with a soft folk album playing in the background—something he’d downloaded years ago. The gas heater blew gently, spreading an even warmth. The fogged windows made him feel protected, as if he were traveling inside a house that breathed with him.

Behind him, in her usual position, was Skye. Her sand-colored van followed like a loyal shadow. Now and then they spoke over the CB radio, short phrases.

“Road holding up so far?” Michael asked.

“All smooth. I’m still alive, though my toes might disagree.”

Michael smiled. “I’ll bring you some tea at the next stop.”

“Deal.”

⸻

They stopped at a small rest area surrounded by pine trees. There was a soaked picnic table, a half-broken bench, and an overflowing trash can. But the ground was solid. And that was enough.

Michael pulled out the kettle and set it on the stove. Skye climbed in shortly after, a blanket around her shoulders and her hands already reaching for the heat.

“My turn to steal your house.”

“Welcome.”

They drank hot tea with honey in silence. Skye watched the rain fall in straight lines down the window.

“You know what’s nice about the rain?” she asked.

“What?”

“It forces you to stop. To do nothing. It leaves you alone with the things inside. But if you’re with the right person… it feels less heavy.”

Michael nodded. He watched the steam rise from their mugs, blend into the humid air, then disappear.

The camper was small, but it felt spacious when they weren’t moving. Curtains drawn, warm light, the guitar on the bed, dishes laid out to dry. A compressed life—but complete.

Skye set the blanket aside and started cooking. Rice with onion, canned chickpeas, turmeric. A made-up recipe, but the smell filled the space. Michael sliced bread, telling a story about the time he’d completely taken the wrong road and ended up sleeping next to a quarry, thinking it was a lake.

Skye laughed with her mouth full.

“You and navigation… a tragic love story.”

“Yeah, but with great plot twists.”

They ate sitting close together at the fold-out table bench. Outside, the rain fell harder, but the sound felt distant, muffled.

After dinner, Michael picked up the guitar and strummed something—a simple melody, without words. Skye lay down, her head resting on a pillow, eyes closed.

“Sounds like a warm room with closed windows,” she murmured.

“That’s exactly what it is.”

⸻

That night, they each slept in their own vehicle, but the CB radio stayed on. It had become a kind of thread between them. Just a click, a word, and the loneliness broke.

“Michael?”

“Yeah.”

“Today was one of those days where nothing really happens, but when it ends, you realize it fixed something inside.”

“Yeah. Same for me.”

Silence.

Then, her voice: “Thanks for being a warm place.”

Michael smiled in the dark.

“Goodnight, Skye.”

“Night.”


Chapter 8 – Unknown Frequency

Rain no longer had seasons.
It had been falling for hours with the same rhythm, unchanged, as if the sky had forgotten how to change.
Michael had been driving for three hours without saying a word. The road twisted like a slick snake through the pines. Every now and then, an abandoned farmhouse, a rusting car carcass, a gas station long out of service. The world was there, but empty. Like a film set left running after the movie was over.

There was no more music on the radio. Just empty waves, distorted signals, ads that sounded ten years old.

Skye was still following him. Behind, in her sand-colored van, headlights low, engine sounding more tired than the day before.

Just before sunset, they found a place to stop: an old gas station on the edge of a secondary highway, half-swallowed by vegetation. Broken windows, moss-covered pumps, a crooked sign. But there was space, and the tin roof would shelter both vehicles. It was enough.

Michael parked, turned off the engine, and let himself sink into the seat.
He reached for the CB radio. “We’ll stop here for the night.”

Skye’s voice came through seconds later, soft and distorted by static.
“This is the ugliest place we’ve found so far.”

“But it’s still.”

“So are cemeteries.”

He smiled. Her jokes kept him afloat, even in strange moments. And this place was strange.
The silence felt too thick. As if something — or someone — was listening.

⸻

After dinner, Michael cleaned up, lowered the curtains, and sat at the table with his notebook.
He wrote a few lines, crossed them out, started over.
Outside, the rain tapped at the windows like nervous fingers.
Inside, the heater blew gently, the light was warm, dim.

Behind him, the guitar rested on the bed. He’d turned on the radio out of habit.
Then off again.

He made himself a tea, wrapped up in a plaid blanket. Sleep came over him suddenly.
He closed his eyes on the bench seat, listening to the camper breathe. And drifted off.

⸻

He woke up at 2:43 AM, without knowing why.

There was no sound. No shake. Just… something in the air.
The rain still fell, but lighter. A muffled, constant sound. The kind that makes you feel alone.
But you aren’t.

Michael sat up, checked his watch instinctively. Looked outside: the windshield was a wall of fog.

Then he heard it.

A click.

Sharp. Artificial.
The CB radio turned on by itself.

A burst of white noise. Then a voice.

“Michael…”

A male voice. Not rough, not high-pitched. Just… cold. Calm. Too calm.

“Don’t turn around. There’s no one behind you. But I’m watching you anyway.”

Michael froze.
Hands on the table. Heart in his throat.
The radio blinked on a channel he’d never used: 21.6

They always used 14.3. Always.

The voice returned.

“You like writing at night. Always with that little yellow light above your notebook.
It’s nice. Makes you seem… real.”

Michael stood slowly.
He didn’t respond.
He stared at the CB as if it might catch fire.

“No need to talk. Not now. We’ll do that later.”

Pause. Static.

“Skye is already awake. Even if she hasn’t realized it.”

Then silence.
The radio shut off by itself. No click. No shutdown sound.

Michael stayed still. He could hear the blood rushing in his ears.
He looked toward Skye’s van. The lights were off. No movement.

Then the radio came back on.
But it was Skye.

“Michael…”

“Yes.”

“Did you… did you hear something?”

“Yes.”

“A voice?”

“Yes.”

Silence.

Then her voice, lower: “It seemed like it knew everything.”

“Even about you.”

“Is it still out there?”

Michael looked around. Saw nothing.
“I don’t know.”

“Turn on a light. Just a small one. So… if something happens…”

Michael switched on the camper’s dimmest light.
Seconds later, a light came on inside Skye’s van too.

Two warm lanterns in the dark.
Two silent signals.

⸻

An hour passed. Maybe more.

Michael sat on the bed, eyes open, CB radio still on—but silent.
No more voices.
No explanations.

He wrote only three words in his notebook:

“It’s always listening.”

Then he turned everything off.
And closed his eyes.
Not to sleep.
Just to stop looking.

1lkcmx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1lkcmx8/siege_matchmaking/,Siege Matchmaking.,"You ever think about the person who coded the quickplay matchmaking in Rainbow Six Siege? I do. I think about them constantly. I think about them in the shower. I think about them when I’m stuck in traffic. I think about them when I close my eyes and try to remember what peace feels like. Because whoever they are, wherever they are, whatever unholy keyboard they used, they should be publicly shamed and then privately investigated.

This person sat down in front of a computer and said I want to ruin afternoons. Not just one afternoon. Every afternoon. I want to create an experience so baffling, so offensive to human intuition, that it haunts players across time zones. They looked at a tactical shooter and said what if we dropped someone into match point, no warning, no prep phase, no operators, just straight into the meat grinder with a recruit holding a shotgun made from recycled plumbing and trauma.

And then they smiled. They smiled. They took a sip of lukewarm gas station coffee and said yes I have done something good today.

Quickplay is supposed to be casual. Fun. A warmup. But this system does not warm you up. It lights you on fire and asks why you are screaming. You click play and ten seconds later you are watching the aftermath of a 0 to 3 stomp where your team consists of one AFK guy, one troll using Clash like a riot shield from a cartoon, and someone who is literally named Sensi420 and only presses W.

You get dropped into these games like a new hire at a company that has already declared bankruptcy. No one is talking. No one knows the plan. You are just a body to throw at the scoreboard and hope something sticks. You load in and someone has already teamkilled two people and the only sound in your headset is someone chewing a bag of chips and breathing like they just ran a marathon in full armor.

And then you think it cannot get worse. But oh it can. You think maybe ranked will save you. Ranked will be better. Ranked will be fair. But ranked matchmaking is run by the same chaos goblin who made quickplay. In ranked you get one guy with 4000 hours and a KD of 1.9 and his duo partner who is playing his first match ever with a controller held upside down.

Your teammates are not teammates. They are cryptids. One guy is crouch walking with a shotgun and has not seen another player in three rounds. One guy is spinning in a circle on the roof. One guy is playing Montagne and sprinting directly into Claymores like he is trying to retire early. You are out here trying to IGL and someone on your team is watching TikToks with their volume all the way up and no push to talk.

And the enemy team. The enemy team is a coordinated five stack from Norway with synchronized loadouts and voices like jazz radio hosts. They know every callout. They have utility timings down to the second. They do not panic. They do not flinch. They do not breathe.

And the system said yes. This is a fair match. This is balance. This is the dream.

How is this real. How is this allowed. What formula is this. What ancient ritual does the matchmaker use. Is there a dice. Is there a goat involved. Are you sacrificing players to the algorithm one match at a time. Because it feels personal. It feels like revenge. It feels like whoever coded this lost a ranked game in 2017 and said never again and then swore a blood oath to make every match feel like emotional sudoku.

And here is the part that gets me. The absolute part that snaps my brain in half like an overcooked breadstick. The system will let you win once. One game. One perfect game. Your team listens. The calls are clean. The plants are perfect. It is bliss. And then boom. Next game you get paired with a man playing from a microwave and someone whose only communication is screaming the word flank at random intervals.

So to the person who made this. To the individual who gave life to this digital disaster. I just want to talk. I want to sit in a cold room with you. One chair. One light. And I want to lean in very close and ask what happened. Who hurt you. Why are you like this. Why did you do this to me. To us. To Siege. You had the power to make it good and instead you made a funnel that takes my time and converts it directly into heartbreak.

I hope the next time you walk into a restaurant they hand you a bill before you order. I hope every time you try to play a game you get matched with your own code. I hope your microwave beeps before your food is done.  That is justice. That is what you made.",0,1750874152.0,Rainbow6,7,0.25,False

My mom was sick with COVID this past Easter, and developed long covid symptoms shortly after. She’s been dealing with intense pain, no appetite, extreme fatigue, etc for 2 months. 

She’s been to multiple doctors, cardiologist, internist, infectious disease, MRIs — she’s had the work up. 

She is so frustrated and just waiting to get better. I called her yesterday at 12:48 to check in and she told me she tried to drink coffee but had to lay back down. I said okay what did you eat? And she said she hasn’t tried to eat yet. She has been surviving on yogurt, protein shakes, and casseroles dropped off by neighbors. 

I’m feeling frustrated because isn’t it common sense that you should be eating food and drinking water before trying to drink coffee especially when you’re ill? Is this a brain fog thing? In two months she hasn’t adapted at all. She got emotional and cried when I told her she needed to feed her body better to heal. 

I have two young kids and she lives 50 mins away, so I’m limited. Does anyone have any suggestions for how I can better understand her?

1lkcj07,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeReviewedIt/comments/1lkcj07/real_results_7minute_ageless_body_secret_review/,Real Results 🔥 7‑Minute Ageless Body Secret Review and Its All‑Day Metabolism Impact,"# 🧘‍♀️ The 7‑Minute Ageless Body Secret ...

So here’s the thing: if you’re over 40, juggling a dozen things a day, and your energy feels like it’s been siphoned off by some invisible vampire... you’re not imagining it.

You’re busy. Your hormones have decided to throw surprise parties. And if your metabolism were any slower, it’d be backing up traffic. I feel you.

The [7 Minute Ageless Body Secret](https://theworldhealth.org/7-minute-ageless-body-secret-official) is a bite-sized solution promising to **boost metabolism**, tone soft spots, and ditch guilt, all in under 10 minutes a day.

But does it really deliver? I temporarily stopped Googling ""**how to tone your body after age 50**"" and I gave it a proper whirl — I even convinced my friend Lisa to try it too — to see if this **quick full-body toning routine for busy women** is worth your precious time.

# 📦 Product Overview

**Product Name**: 7 Minute Ageless Body Secret  
**Category**: Fitness & Wellness ➝ Women's Workouts  
**Overall Verdict**: 4.4/5

# 🔍 What Is the 7 Minute Ageless Body Secret?

It’s a smartly ordered sequence of low-impact movements made for women 40 and up. The goal? Trigger fat burn, improve strength, and restore energy.

This isn’t HIIT hell or trendy gym fluff. It’s **a short daily routine that supports hormonal balance** and eases you into a rhythm without overloading your joints.

You’ll find yourself doing **fat-burning exercises that are easy on the joints**, targeting hips, thighs, arms, and belly with no equipment and no burpees (bless).

The program revolves around **a highly effective 7‑minute fat-loss workout**, which kickstarts metabolism and tones the body without the sweat-drenched drama.

# 🔥 How It Works: The Metabolism-Boosting Secret Sauce

The secret is a deliberate series of moves that stimulate muscle groups and [prolong fat burn](https://theworldhealth.org/7-minute-ageless-body-secret-official) — think of it as **a low-impact exercise that activates the afterburn effect**.

This is how **short workouts can keep your body burning fat all day**, even while folding laundry or fussing with emails you forgot to reply to (again).

It’s also **a metabolism-boosting workout plan for women in their 50s** — especially those looking to recharge without pounding pavement or joining bootcamps.

Consistency triggers better results. The afterburn helps your body use energy efficiently while addressing hormonal shifts that love storing belly fat.

# 📚 What’s Included in the Program

Inside you’ll get three follow-along workout videos, a warm-up session, a quickstart guide, and a full manual. Extras include tips and anti-aging recipes.

These **age-defying home workouts created for women** are fully digital, so you can start immediately from your laptop, tablet, or weirdly large phone.

This kit supports **simple at-home workouts designed for women** that focus on small wins — moves you can repeat without getting bored or hurting something.

If you’ve searched for **a consistent fitness routine ideal for busy schedules**, this setup hits that sweet spot between sustainable and satisfying.

# 👩‍🎨 Lisa's Experience Using the 7 Minute Ageless Body Secret

This one actually came from my friend **Lisa**, who I met at a local community composting co-op last summer.

She’s a high school art teacher in her mid-40s and spends half her day either hunched over student projects or standing for hours doing class demos — not exactly gentle on the body.

She’s also the type who doesn’t have the time (or frankly, the patience) for long workouts and endless health trends.

Lisa started using the [7 Minute Ageless Body Secret](https://theworldhealth.org/7-minute-ageless-body-secret-official) because she wanted something realistic she could do between grading papers and prepping for classes — something to **tone your body quickly without doing heavy cardio**. She texted me about it one weekend:

>*“You’d actually like this — it’s not annoying and I’m not sweaty for once.”*

She loved how the routine felt manageable without being boring. After a couple weeks, she said her back didn’t ache as much after long school days, and she noticed her waist felt firmer.

Her biggest win? Feeling like she could stick with it without guilt-tripping herself.

Her only tiny gripe? She wished the video setting had a little more personality. (Her words: “I’m visual — give me a plant or something!”)

But overall, she felt it was **a daily fitness routine that** worked well **for her busy schedules** — and she’s still doing it three mornings a week before making her first coffee.

I’m visiting Budapest in a few days and would love some recommendations:
I’m looking for laptop-friendly cafes with good Wi-Fi where I can sit and work for a few hours. Bonus points if the vibe is nice and not too loud!
I’m into playing volleyball (casual games). Any tips on where to look for groups or places where people usually play?

Also, I’d really appreciate any general recommendations for places to visit, hidden gems, or local favorites during my stay. And if anyone is up for showing me around or grabbing a coffee, that would be awesome too

I've (42F) lurked for a while but haven't posted much.  I'm realizing I need more of a support group in order to stay successful with keto so hopefully we can be friends 😉 

I've been low carb for 5+ years, low added sugar since Jan 2024 and have earnestly been kero since the new year. I have always had a strong sweet tooth and truly thought that eliminating added sugar and fruit would make me more sensitive to sweets, to the point of losing the cravings. 

Instead, I think I've confirmed that I'm just addicted to sugar, lol. Once I have a bit of anything remotely sweet (I'm talking cheese/nuts/PB/dark chocolate/ berries) I really struggle to stop. 

Parties and social gatherings are the hardest and I've started to cope with that by sipping a black coffee or other zero cal drink to keep me occupied.

Hey guys,

Throwing my hat into the ring here! I'm a 28-year-old guy from Pennsylvania, looking to meet a great woman for a genuine connection. I'm not really into games or fleeting encounters; I'm hoping to find someone I can truly click with, laugh with, and build something meaningful.
A little about me:

 *Professionally: I'm a billing analyst for a utility company near me. I find my work fulfilling and enjoy the challenges it brings!


 *Hobbies & Interests: When I'm not working, you can usually find me hiking local trails, playing some vidya games, reading manga, and watching pretty much any anime or horror movie I can get my hands on. I'm always open to trying new things and sharing experiences.


*Personality: Friends would describe me as sarcastic but kind, reliable, and a good listener. I value open communication, a good sense of humor, and someone who's comfortable being themselves.


 * What I'm looking for: 

I'm hoping to find a woman who is ambitious, kind-hearted, has a great sense of humor, enjoys intellectual conversations, and loves animals! 

Someone who's excited about life and isn't afraid to be authentic. Whether it's exploring a new town, trying a new restaurant, or just chilling on the couch with a good movie, I'm looking for someone to share those moments with.
If any of this resonates with you, send me a message! Tell me a little about yourself and what you're looking for. Bonus points if you have a favorite local spot for coffee, pizza or hiking! (:

Looking forward to hearing from you!

TL;DR moved to a new city to be with LDR partner who broke up with me.

Was debating posting this, but would really appreciate some sort of feedback or confirmation on my thoughts.

Me [22F] and my ex [27M] recently broke off a 1y+ relationship. We were doing long distance for about 8mo. when I decided to move up to his city about 6 hours away. We talked about it a lot and knew that we wanted to be in the same city, so I made the decision. Our relationship up until moving was really great. I told myself I would never do long distance, or move to a city for a guy, but he changed my mind and made it worth it to me. We were constantly traveling back and forth to see each other and going on trips. He was always so kind and thoughtful, we never fought, he was the first one that made me think about a committed future with someone. 

Well, fast forward a few months. He was constantly nitpicking me, putting me down, turning the narrative, gaslighting me, and while doing all of this, he used my negative reactions in response to how he treated me against me. I realize now how unhealthy it is, but in the grand scheme of things, I don’t think it was enough to warrant a breakup. 

I have now been living in this new city with him for 3mos. and he decided to break up with me three days ago at 2am while we were drunk because I mentioned I rode motorbikes a few weeks ago with some of my coworkers after work. I didn’t stay long, got home at dinner time, but didn’t think it was a big enough deal to tell him at the time. He knew I hung out with them the week before and didn’t have a problem with it. Well now he’s convinced himself I cheated on him because I omitted this time I hung out with people. Granted, I work with only guys, so I could see how he could overthink this. But in my position, he’s been telling me I need more friends and shouldn’t rely on him as much emotionally. I’ve tried making girlfriends in the city to no avail, and I thought the guys at work were nice so I hung out with them twice. I told him after that though I wouldn’t hang out with them any longer because he made a few comments about the guys at work. 

Really, I knew he was over it awhile ago, I tried to break up with him a month ago because I felt so unloved and unappreciated, and he let me go. The next few days he wrote pages talking about how he’s going to be better, work on himself for us, how we can communicate better, and he even scheduled a therapy session. I know everything in the relationship wasn’t all his fault, I wasn’t the greatest at all times either, but I thought we could work things through. It seemed like lack of healthy communication was the biggest thing. 

The night we broke up he couldn’t even say to me that he was breakup up with me. He walked me to the door as I was about to walk home he asked if I was taking my stuff? So I had to ask if he was breaking up with me and he said yes. I was so shocked and drunk it didn’t even kick in, so I said I’m going home. He tried walking me home so that “I wouldn’t get assaulted” and I told him if he’s breaking up with me then I don’t want him walking me home. So he went back up to his apartment.

The next day it didn’t really hit me. I told him the night before I’d pick up my stuff at noon, when I showed up he was really cold and had my stuff in a box. I left and prioritized myself, spent the day alone, started a new book, etc. I felt completely fine. I downloaded tinder for about 6hrs, not because I was actually trying to find someone to hookup with, but because I needed some sort of confirmation that I was still wanted by someone. Basically just an ego trip. I realized it was unhealthy and I deleted it that day. In that span of time though, his friends had apparently found my profile.

The next day is when everything went to shit. I’m talking full body breakdown. I physically haven’t been able to eat. All I can think about is him. He never had a conversation with me about the breakup and why exactly he did it, because I didn’t think the coworkers situation was grounds to break up. So I broke the silence and asked if he could meet for coffee so I could get closure. He said maybe in a week. So I asked if we could just call and get it over with, he said he needed to “set a boundary” and call the next day. I honestly didn’t think that was fair considering he just dumped me without any conversation and didn’t talk the following day. So I called him until he picked up. All he could talk about were bullshit reasons I ruined the relationship but also how much he still loves me. A person really in love wouldn’t end it so suddenly? And of course it doesn’t end there. I drunkenly walked over to his place at 6pm and found him walking down the stairs with his friend. He looked so happy, and honestly smiled even more when he saw me. That broke me. His friend walked off so we could talk, and we had a short conversation. I just felt like I needed to say goodbye in person. And he ended it with saying he hasn’t been happy in over a month. Now keep in mind, I broke up with him a month before because I felt unloved. So it seems like this whole time he just got back together with me so he could slowly transition out of the relationship. I thought the past month was better and I still loved him. It just sucks feeling so betrayed. But he still wants to get coffee. This is just him trying to keep me on a hook right? I only wanted to get coffee so that we could talk about things in person. I’m almost absolutely certain he never wants to get back together with me. So why would he still want to see me? Selfish.

I honestly just needed to get this off my chest and hopefully get some input. I blocked him after I saw him in person and there’s no real way to communicate, but he knows where I live and the code to my building. He had so many chances to run after me, to say he was sorry, try and fix things. And I think the silence speaks volumes. I just feel so shitty completely uprooting my old life to move here, only to end up with nothing. I think I did prioritize him too much in my life, but I think you should prioritize a partner you see a future with. This completely ruined my outlook on relationships. I’m tempted to unblock him and leave it like that, or see if he still wants to meet up one last time. I really just want to get back together. I’ve thought about trying to sublease my apartment and move cities again but it was so difficult finding my current job and apt, I know I’ll have an even more difficult time somewhere else with no support.

I figured I would just post back to back, since I tried both the washed and natural versions of this geisha. The side-by-side always makes me question my assumptions, insightful.

**Coffee Review #06 – Luminous – Bolivia Geisha Washed**

**Date:** June 25th, 2025  
**Coffee:** Bolivia Geisha Washed  
**Roaster:** Luminous  
**Country:** Bolivia  
**Region:** La Paz  
**Producer:** Juan Carlos Huanca  
**Process:** Washed (with thermal shock processing - cherries heated to 57°C then cooled to -2°C)  
**Altitude:** 1,541 m.a.s.l.  
**Varietal:** Geisha  
**Roast Date:** March 14, 2025

**BREW DETAILS**

* **Method:** Pour Over
* **Roast Level:** Light
* **Grinder:** K-Ultra
* **Grind Size:** 0.7.0
* **Dripper:** D27
* **Water:** TWW 50% dilution
* **Water Temp:** 200°F
* **Ratio:** 1:17
* **Dose:** 10g
* **Total Brew Time:** 2:36
* **Pour Recipe:**
   * **0:00:** 52g
   * **1:00:** 91g (39g)
   * **1:20:** 130g (39g)
   * **1:40:** 170g (40g)

**TASTING NOTES**

The fragrance is quite muted with medium-low to low intensity - not much coming through initially. The aroma shows medium-low intensity with hints of green tea and earthy qualities on the nose.

Flavor intensity sits at medium with medium-plus taste complexity. Sweetness comes through at medium intensity, providing a nice foundation. The acidity presents at medium intensity with a somewhat drying quality in the aftertaste that lingers at medium-plus intensity.

The mouthfeel is medium-plus with some drying characteristics. There's a distinct green, vegetative quality throughout that aligns with the green tea notes. The cup feels a bit muted overall - perhaps would benefit from a finer grind to extract more flavor complexity and bring out the acidity more prominently.

Luminous scored this washed version slightly higher than the natural. Hot take, but this washed version didn't quite match up to the natural processed version of this same Geisha, lacking some of the vibrancy and complexity found in the natural. Even as the coffee cooled, the expected increase in acidity didn't materialize, leaving the overall profile feeling somewhat simple. What's interesting is that Luminous notes that ""this is a natural processed coffee which has been subjected to thermal shock,"" but then calls this a washed processed bean. The beans are dark visually, so I was initially tipped off that it might be more processed.

**SCORE:** 5.9/10

Scoring (t8ke scale for reference below):

1 | Disgusting | So bad I poured it out  
2 | Poor | I wouldn't consume by choice  
3 | Bad | Multiple flaws  
4 | Sub-par | Not bad, but many things I'd rather have  
5 | Good | Good, just fine  
6 | Very Good | A cut above  
7 | Great | Well above average  
8 | Excellent | Really quite exceptional  
9 | Incredible | An all-time favorite  
10 | Perfect | Perfect

1lkbyg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeSpotlight/comments/1lkbyg7/i_spent_6_months_visiting_terrible_coffee_shops/,I spent 6 months visiting terrible coffee shops before finding this directory – here's what I wish I knew earlier,"Okay, so I've been working remotely for the past year and became obsessed with finding good coffee shops to work from. Sounds simple, right? Wrong.

I tried everything from Google Maps to Foursquare to asking locals. Most recommendations led me to overpriced tourist traps or places where the ""specialty coffee"" tasted like it came from a broken Keurig machine. I probably wasted $300+ and countless hours on disappointing coffee experiences.

# How I stumbled onto this thing

I was complaining to a friend (probably for the 50th time) about another terrible cafe experience when they mentioned this directory called Addicted Coffee Bar. At first, I was skeptical because honestly, how many coffee review sites can there be? But I was desperate enough to try anything.

# What actually worked (and what didn't)

Here's my brutally honest take after using it for 3 months:

**What it nailed:**

* They actually understand the difference between ""coffee shops"" and ""GOOD coffee shops"" – only 45 specialty coffee places made their main list, which tells you they're being selective
* The city-specific breakdown is genius. Instead of random scattered reviews, they focus on actual coffee cities (Portland, SF, Seattle, etc.)
* They track stuff that matters to remote workers: WiFi quality, outlet availability, noise levels. Most review sites ignore this completely
* The pet-friendly verification is legit – took my dog to 3 different places they recommended and zero issues

**Where it missed the mark:**

* Limited geographic coverage right now (only covers major cities)
* Some smaller neighborhood gems aren't listed yet
* The organic coffee filter only shows 5 places, which seems low

**What surprised me most:** The educational aspect. They don't just tell you WHERE to go – they explain WHY each place is special. Like, I learned more about coffee brewing methods from their shop descriptions than I did from years of casual coffee drinking. It's weird but actually useful.

# The stuff nobody talks about

Here's what's actually valuable about this approach:

**Time savings are insane.** Instead of wandering around hoping to find decent coffee, I can just check their verified list. Haven't had a truly bad coffee experience since I started using it.

**The community angle works.** You can share your own finds, but it's not like Yelp where Karen complains about everything. People actually know coffee here.

**Interactive maps are clutch.** Especially when you're in an unfamiliar neighborhood and need to find something decent quickly.

# If you're thinking of checking it out

**Do this first:**

* Make sure your city is covered (they're still building out)
* Use the feature filters – seriously, if you need pet-friendly or outdoor seating, those tags actually work
* Start with their ""Third Wave"" category if you're picky about coffee quality

**Don't bother unless:**

* You actually care about coffee quality (if Starbucks is fine for you, this is overkill)
* You're willing to maybe drive a bit further for better coffee
* You want to discover new places vs. just finding the closest caffeine source

**Pro tip:** Check the ""roasted on-site"" filter if you're really into fresh coffee. Only 23 places made that list, but every single one I tried was exceptional.

# The reality check

Look, this isn't going to magically solve all your coffee problems. If you live in a small town with 2 coffee shops total, this directory won't help much. And if you're the type of person who thinks all coffee tastes the same, you'll probably find this way too detailed.

But if you're like me – someone who got tired of coffee roulette and wants consistent quality – it's actually pretty solid. The fact that they verify stuff like ""actually good for remote work"" instead of just copying generic Google reviews makes a huge difference.

# The breakdown I promised

Because I went full research mode on this (occupational hazard of being a data nerd), I documented everything – which features actually matter, how their verification process works, examples of places I found through different search methods, etc.

You can read the full breakdown [here](https://addictedcoffeebar.com) if you want to skip the trial-and-error phase I went through.

Honestly, if this helps even one person avoid the terrible coffee shop experiences I had to endure, it's worth sharing. Remote work is hard enough without having to drink garbage coffee while doing it.",1,1750872622.0,CoffeeSpotlight,0,1.0,False

More steep gravel switchbacks and loathsome ripios. More frantic marathons between tight ferry connections. Bucolic harbor towns idling in the steam of hot morning coffee and the trumpeting foghorn of imminent departures. Falling asleep on the boat’s steel cargo deck floor, an exhausted heap puddled beneath my own bike. Waves lapping at my shoes. Gently rocked between dreams by the motor’s calming troll.
 
A spoke explodes in the dust of rocky shrapnel. Then another. My bike is growing resistant to the finish line, it seems. I’ve overworked its drivetrain by some 7,000 miles and replacement parts have remained nearly impossible to source across the entirety of South America.
 
Lashing the two broken spokes together with an old strip of velcro, I rode another hundred miles to Chaitén, the next-closest village, where an abuelito was riding a rusted mountain bike of his own. I asked if he knew any mechanics nearby. “Siempre llevo radias extras conmigo, pero no las herramientas exactas a reemplezarlas.” He said there was someone named Jorquera a few kilometers south of town. I surveyed more locals to see if anyone had his phone number until a friendly older couple wrote it down and invited me back for breakfast the next day if I needed to stick around.
 
Jorquera’s bike shop was a happy kind of chaos. A tired wooden tool shed in the forest, half cobwebs, half scattered tools and blackened rags. He rustled through them like an anthropologist, unearthing just the right wrench from a tangled pile of discarded parts.
 
His work pace was frenzied and his Spanish was even faster, nearly impossible to translate in time with the lyrical wave of bikepacking formalities. “Donde vienes y adonde vas? Hablas bien español, como aprendías?” You get used to strangers feeling more like family, a universal camaraderie between the smashing of tools and instant coffee. “How bad are the ripios?” I always ask, as if it helps to know. “When will the road start to climb? A storm is coming, have you heard any news?”
 
We couldn’t unlatch my cassette’s lockring, even after hammering away at it with a flathead wedge, so Jorquera snipped a spoke bead off from its tip and bent the rod into place. A temporary fix, not exactly reliable, but we estimated my odds of survival at about 100%. Maybe further down the road I’d find better luck.",8,1750872482.0,xbiking,2,0.9,False

For whatever reason i have lower mental energy than normal people and i'm confident its just how i am born, it was always like that and it was a constant through my whole life. Sadly nobody seriously looked into that problem when i was young (i guess because i had excellent junior-mid school grades and because its not really an intelligence problem), and for some i was just lazy and for some it was just how i am and that's ""fine"". I ve been trying to find a solution for this problem for a while but its just not fixable, everything i do is just to make it ""bearable"", i'm doing gym, i'm eating almost perfectly healthy, i'm sleeping regularly decent hours and all the healthy stuff like drinking water, not overdoing coffee, managing vitamins etc etc, and even tho objectively i do feel better somewhat, mentally the needle is not shifted significant compared to periods where i was the literal opposite. I just wanna point out that while i did have depressive phases through my life , and i did have some things like anxiety etc, it was never severe or diagnosed or long lasting and i always overcame it and as i see it: those were partially consequence of my original problem combined with stuff like environment, social stuff etc. those just made it worse but they were never the cause, and i'm very confident on that, i am now for long period perfectly healthy and progressing and i have none of those and it just doesn't matter. I feel like a machine that has a low process limit and it was always like that.                                                                

From symptoms related to neurology, i remember developing tics where i bite my finger skin on knuckle and then hit my nose after it (and smell it), and i had that one probably 4-5 times through life for few months or more to the point where i had to quit it like quitting a nicotine cold turkey, and i specially developed that one at points of life where i was studying intensively (or using brain) for longer periods of time, i also had migraines in the recent years where i get blurred vision suddenly (again after using brain intensively for periods of time), and then i get severe headache for a day or two, more severe at start and then slowly releasing over time, i kinda stopped using my brain for abstract thinking and trying to learn new things because its just not worth it, its like i have to intentionally force myself to be an npc and not learn things in order to be functional in life, and that just sucks. I did research on general mental issues, and because my problems somewhat overlap with adhd or maybe autism (i would never get diagnosed for those in my country neither do i care about a diagnose personally) i tried to get medicine for adhd because it sounds like it can help with my issue but only 2 medicine for it in my country are Concerta (very hard to get) and Welbutrin, and while concerta did help with motivation and helped me do things that i usually find too draining, it leaves me with exhaustion after it expire so it feels like i just concentrate all my mental capacity for the period of it (6h or so) and im fried so it wasn't worth it and i wouldn't get prescribed anyways, and welbutrin gave me severe side effects on minimal dose very early.

I used to get passive aggressive emails and reminded of something I had done wrong 3 months later. But I loved my job and put it down to personal issues I knew they were having and I thought of them as a mentor and friend. 

I basically I had burnout and I decided to leave. They took this incredibly badly like you are leaving me, you are letting us down, after all I've done for you. Which made me spiral for a month before committing to leave because you might appreciate I was quite unwell. 

Since then I tried to continue with them. But I kept contacting them a lot because I thought I had really hurt my friend and wanted to fix it. But it became too much and the boundaries kept changing like they could apparently only reply certain weekends and were too busy for meetings and things like this. I confronted them when a friend had died and they said I am not doing anything basically iced me out. 

More recently I discovered something I do wrong sometimes I need to work on and so I asked them for another chance I really think a lot of it is all on me. Again they were like you are too much, made accusations I knew nothing about and said not to contact them again but hoped I was doing ok. Needless to say I spiralled and sent lots of emails before they picked up the phone. It's really subtle but they said although they don't want to stay in touch because obs I probably do seem insane it honestly triggers me a lot they would talk to me if they saw me, if I lived closer they would go for coffee with me and to tell them how I am doing in a month to a year. 

I've been using chatGPT a lot but it just agrees with you! And my friends and family are like this is a huge red flag. But is it all me?

1lkbnpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1lkbnpz/coping_with_feelings_of_emptiness_once_the/,Coping with feelings of emptiness once the initial relief wears off.,"Hello Friends,

The stress of dating someone with BPD and being their FP takes such a toll over time. As I'm sure many can relate, once a BPD breakup occurs, your first sensation as an FP/now former FP is this all-encompassing sense of relief. One symptom I had when the stress of the relationship ended was uncontrollable laughter. I had immediately gone to the gym and was laughing maniacally to the point acquaintances at the gym were asking if I was ok. I had never laughed like that in my life. I literally couldn't stop. I think it was the release of pressure and emotional tension the likes of which I had never dealt with nor knew existed (even after the death of loved ones and friends, non-BPD divorce, etc). 

However the relief is short-lived. After perhaps a few weeks of enjoying a cup of coffee or how the sun felt on my skin again, the feeling of the abyss inside began to escalate. The emptiness that devours you night and day on a soul level. If the BPD ex was emotional cancer, this feeling is akin to emotional radiation burns. Even though you know you narrowly escaped hell, there is some part of you that misses the warmth. Will I ever feel warm again without being so close to Hades? 

A relevant side topic here is how you can go from FP status (almost demigodhood) to being unacknowledged like you ceased existing entirely. When my non-BPD ex-wife and I divorced, it was amicable and we still respected each other as human beings. A BPD breakup is exactly not that. It is the most vitriolic, inhumane experience of my life to this point. I've heard stories of enemy combatants treating each other with more civility.  

Anyhow, I'm in therapy and actively reading books (just ordered Whole Again), and consuming content like this sub that helps me work through and rationalize the hell I endured. I only thought relational tornados like this existed in reality tv and movies. Never dreamed it would be an integral part of my life. Before my BPD experience of the last 2 years, I had no problem dating. Now I can barely stand the thought of dating. It all seems so horribly exhausting. Or maybe I'm just exhausted. Two months out from final breakup followed by final discard (because of course she couldn't take being broken up with and had to have the last word, or bombard me with the last million words). 

Any tips on dealing with the emptiness? ",10,1750871936.0,BPDlovedones,1,1.0,False
1lkbnn0,https://i.redd.it/lr4uokb6x39f1.jpeg,Smiling at my new perspective,"At our last house, I learned to garden. I planted many trees and shrubs, a vegetable garden, a mini orchard. I added flowers to help the bees, and learned to mulch leaves and leave the dead plants/stalks, etc. I thought I was doing fairly well. 

At my new house, the woman gardened a lot. She grew non native plants and some native plants, but in her last years, she wasn’t able to tend them. 

I spent my first year clearing out weeds. The second year, I saw what she had intentionally planted, and I started learning about my volunteers that filled the gaps (or grew through the intended plantings). Jack in the pulpit, flea bane, giant golden rod, evening primrose, swamp milkweed, swamp azalea. I live abutting a nature preserve, and I removed Japanese barberry, spice bush grew in its place voluntarily. I’m seeing choke cherry, high bush blueberry, dogwood. 

Today I saw a new butterfly, a spice bush swallowtail. I have fireflies, dragonflies, and so many bees. 

I also have bugs that freak me tf out, but I am learning. I am in a neighborhood filled with lawn and pesticide regimens, monoculture, and I smile seeing all of the things in our yard. Is my garden mildly chaotic? Yes, but my 6:30 am walk around my yard with a cup of coffee and the gentle buzzing of bees brings me such serene joy.

1lkbnbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/PitchBoulder/comments/1lkbnbd/twinbots_smarter_schools_one_system_chaithanya/,"Twinbots- Smarter Schools, One System - Chaithanya Karuna","Chaithanya (Chay) Karuna presented his startup TwinBots.

TwinBots app is called Is-Kool, available in Android and iPhone. 

Schools and parents have too many apps to track their children. Most of these apps are one size fits all. Most are expensive. 

Several companies are solving this problem. Each specializes in something, such as transportation, homework. Is-Kool will do everything on one app.

Two schools are using Is-Kool. Schools are in India.

Team is Chai, his wife, a product VP, and a team of developers in India.

Asking for $1M for two years. Goal is to on-board 13 schools. in 2026.

Toby, ERP Systems, has children. Different customers are different. How can an app with so many functions be customizable to all customers.

Chai: Customizable means modules can be selected, not customized. One-time purchase, not subscription.

Bob Goodman, Focus Strategy, nine startups. Doesn't like pitch. Don't point at the screen. Don't hold a coffee cup. Address the audience. Traction? SaaS is preferred to one-time purchase software.

JV Crum, podcaster. Presentation style. Spellcheck slides. Don't use the word ""trying."" Business model unclear. Sales path, revenue model.

Hans. $60,000 per school. SaaS is preferable because of software maintenance costs. Sequoia Ventures sample pitch deck. Pitch deck designer. Traction slide should be #3.

Ian K. Pitch vs. presentation. Pitch is selling, investors want to understand your business. Deep problem, who has the pain point, who will pay for it?

Aubrey Schick, FDA software. Doesn't understand product. How is product saving time? Doesn't know what parents are tracking?

  
Chai: Customers are school admins. Penelope the school admin has three apps, Infinity Campus to track grades, SDM Map to track logging and and logging out of school, messaging app to talk to parents. Penelope has to login to three apps. Pain is login to one app, do a job, login to another app, do another job. Is there copying and pasting between apps? Process hasn't been solved.

If school admin has the problem, why would parents, teachers, and students use it? Do parents, teachers, and students have a problem?

  
Joel, Mobi Decks. Traction? 

Tracy, teacher. Schools budgets are being cut. Declining populations as people have fewer children. School admins aren't decisionmakers. School districts are huge.

  
Sindbad, storyteller. Who is the user experiencing pain? What are users liking about the app?

Chai: One login to do multiple jobs. Saving time logging in. 

  
Toby, again. Market is India or US? 

Chai: US and India are similar markets, using similar apps.

  
Greg. Pitch should be like movie, hero's journey, save the cat.

I'm happy to report that the coffee table has found a new home 😂 So, as many of you suggested, I ordered a smaller, round, lighter-colored coffee table (included in the pics since it hasn’t arrived yet).

I might be jumping the gun a little, but I’d love your help brainstorming a rug and accent wall color! We’re painting the main walls SW's Greek Villa and are thinking of placing the accent wall in the back, but not sure what would look best. We're going for a light, cozy vibe.

I asked ChatGPT for rug inspo (also in pics) and I really like the color! I know any rug in a high-traffic area will need cleaning, but we want something that's comfy and not a nightmare to clean. We have 2 cats who like to gift us the occasional hairball. Any tips on rugs, pads, or brands that hold up well?

We’re first-time homeowners, so all suggestions are super appreciated. Thanks again! This community has been so great! 😊

1lkbhdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/RetirementReady/comments/1lkbhdh/solo_partnered_or_community_living_find_your_fit/,"Solo, Partnered, or Community Living? Find Your Fit","**Solo, Partnered, or Community Living? Find Your Fit!**

You ever sit back and imagine how you want to spend your golden years? Maybe you’ve got visions of sipping coffee on a sunny porch, or perhaps you picture laughing with friends in a bustling community center. 🌞✨ 

Let me tell you, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to living arrangements as we age! The choice between *solo living*, *partnered vibes*, or embracing a *community lifestyle* can feel overwhelming, but let's break it down a bit. 

**Here’s a quick rundown of each option:**

1. **Solo Living**  
   - **Independence, baby!** You call the shots on everything from decor to dinner time.  
   - **Quiet time galore.** Perfect for introverts or those who love peaceful solitude.  
   - **But…** Are you prepared for the occasional bout of loneliness?  

2. **Partnered Living**  
   - **Shared laughs and moments.** Life is better with a buddy, especially when you can reminisce about old times.  
   - **Two heads are better than one.** You both can help each other out with the daily grind.  
   - **However…** You’ll need to navigate differences—like who leaves the toilet seat up (guilty! 🙈).  

3. **Community Living**  
   - **Social butterflies unite!** Engage with a whole group of friends, making life an adventure every day.  
   - **Built-in support system.** It’s like living in a giant sitcom—always someone around to share meals or stories.  
   - **But…** Are you ready for that blend of personalities? It can be a wild ride!  

Honestly, the key is figuring out what *empowers you* to choose how you live as you age. It's about crafting a lifestyle that suits your needs, desires, and dreams—because you deserve to feel at home in whatever scenario you choose! 

I recently found an awesome resource on living options that can really help with this journey. It’s all about empowerment and understanding your choices as you age. Check it out [here](https://mavely.app.link/e/TuANm4vQCSb)! (Just a friendly heads-up: it’s a referral link, so I might get a little something if you find it helpful!).

Remember, whether you're living solo, with your partner, or in a community setting, there’s beauty in each choice. Each has its perks and quirks, right? 🥳 

So let’s discuss! What do you love or dread about your current living situation? Dreaming of switching it up? Let's hear those thoughts!",1,1750871541.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

Ran into him randomly and now he’s reaching out. Is it worth revisiting?","I (28F) was seeing this guy (29M) last year for a little over a month. We met through mutual friends, and honestly, I really liked him.

I’ve been single for four years now, and it’s rare for me to like someone. But when I met him, I felt excited for the first time in a long time. On paper, he checked a lot of the boxes. And when I got to know him better, we also shared a lot of the same values, lifestyle, goals, outlook on life, etc. I was genuinely excited to see where it might go.

We went on about five dates that I thought were going well. But eventually, he told me he just didn’t feel the spark and wanted to end things. I was sad, of course, but I wasn't going to try to convince him otherwise. I still respected him as a person and was happy he was upfront. So we ended on good terms.

Fast forward a year later. This past weekend, I was waiting in line for a cafe/bakery, and the wait time was about an hour (NYC food culture lol)... Out of nowhere I heard my name. It was him. He happened to be walking by and spotted me. He got in line with me, and we ended up catching up, grabbing coffee and pastries, and sitting down to chat even more. It was honestly really nice seeing him again, and he definitely made the line go by a lot quicker. When I left I didn't think anything of it at all. It was just like seeing an old friend.

But later that evening, he texted me:  
""Hey, wasn't expecting to run into you again, but I'm really glad it happened. If you're up for it, I'd love to catch up more. Maybe over dinner or drinks?""

Now I feel a little confused. Like I said, I really liked him before, and I accepted that he didn’t feel the same. But now he’s reaching out again, and I’m wondering… Can chemistry change? Is he potentially interested again? What's different this time? Should I go? I'm scared of potentially putting myself out there with him, getting feelings, and him just telling me there's still no spark once again.

TLDR: Was seeing a guy last year and he ended things saying there was no spark. Ran into him again by chance, and now he’s asking me to dinner. Not sure what it means, but could there be something worth exploring this time?",1,1750871395.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

I was at my favourite coffee shop, just trying to order my usual latte, and the barista was talking to me. I swear, he said something and I just... didn't catch it. It wasn't loud music or background chatter; it was just a quiet conversation, and I had to lean in awkwardly and ask him to repeat himself twice. He looked a little annoyed, and I just felt totally mortified.

It's been happening more and more lately. Family dinners are a nightmare of me constantly saying ""What?"" or just nodding along pretending I heard something. Even watching TV, the volume is creeping higher and higher, and my partner is starting to complain. I'm in my late 50s, and I always thought this was something that happened much later in life.

Do you like it?,"We just found out we are expecting child #2 and our first is just over 2. We are considering our options, a nanny or some sort of Montessori care for my first child. She'll be almost 3 by the time the baby is born. My thought is the nanny could focus more on my toddler and take her to activities and I focus on the baby just like I did alone the first time around. Then when they come back could trade off or what not. I just also don't know how this all works with a nanny and 2 kids.

Here are my fears with a nanny and WFH while not always having to be glued to a computer: 

I fear I won't feel like I can be myself in my home. 

Having to keep up with cleaning and messes so it doesn't look trashy for a nanny.

We have two dogs that can quite frankly be annoying at times following us around, barking at anything outside etc. I fear I won't even be able to yell/scold the dogs in our normal fashion without looking crazy to a nanny.

I go about my home as I please now, so I don't want it to feel like I'm interrupting the nanny care or am I supposed to get involved too if I'm not busy?

We have a smallish house, all one level and one bathroom, not even a kitchen table; we eat at the coffee table.

I also have fears of someone else driving my kids around but I deeply know that my eldest will need more socialization outside of the home, especially closer to 3+.

What have been your experiences with WFH and having a nanny? Is it weird? Do you get past it? I don't want to hole up in my desk space just because. ",0,1750871239.0,workingmoms,9,0.5,False

1lkbbs7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lkbbs7,A review of both Pineward prototype collections,"Hello fellow Pineward fans - I purchased both the woodsy and gourmand prototype sets, and I've given them all a good sniff from a tester strip - here are my thoughts!

**The Woodlands:**

🐻  *Béar: cedar, chaparral, pinyon*
This was oddly sweet for me right of fthe front. there's a hint of smokiness that comes after, maybe it's the pinion? A resin/sappy smell is there too in the back. Woody, dry and sweet.

🌿 *Lórien: pine, eucalyptus, moss*
I am so happy this is not overwhelmingly pine!! Some of the pine scents I've had from here in the past have been BAM PINE, but not this one! I got a lot of the eucalyptus in this sample - slightly minty, woodsy, a hint of citrus. Reminds me of a Yankee candle my dad would LOVE.

🦌*Faun Forest: pomegranate, blackberry, fir*
This is VERY juicy fruity, but not sweet fruity. You definitely get the pomegranate and blackberry with some planty undertones, could be the fir but also just the berry bush!

🏰  *Mournhold: coffee, leather, fir*
I didn't get any coffee from this, just all leather all the time. There's a bit of the fir in the background too - I want to try this on my skin to see if I can wrestle the coffee out of this one.

🌱 *Holy Cross: bluebell, watercress, lichen*
This is soft, clean, and bright. You get the gentle floral bluebell with something slightly spicy/peppery in the background, which I think is the watercress? GREAT spring perfume!

🌲 *Northwild: lavender, fir, moss*
This sample smacks you with the fir! I got that vicks-like quality from this one, where it opens your nostrils and is a little cooling. I didn't really get the lavender but I don't smell it much, so maybe it's there woven into the fir wreath.

**The Gourmands:**

☕  *Cocoa Tabac: cocoa, tobacco, amber*
Now THIS has the coffee I was looking for in Mournhold, alibet a little sweeter. It's followed with that smoky tobacco that might also give it the earthy background I get.

🍊  *Pottsfield: bitter orange, honey, spice*
This sample gives me a prominent citrus peel and fall spices. I don't get a lot of sweetness in this, it smells more like a fall potpurri. I want to return to this and give it another shot because I wanted to love this.

🍒 *Cordial: cherry, cocoa, brandy*
Straight up biting into one of those Cella's cherry cordial candies. You get the sweet, syrupy cherry with just a hint of alcohol, and then the chocolate follows.  Makes me want to go buy some 😅 

🎃  *Pumpkivus: pumpkin, brown sugar, vetiver*
Another one I have to come back to - I get a lot of the smoky vetiver and maybe some natural pumpkin (like you're carving a jack 'o lantern), but I'm missing the brown sugar sweetness.

🌸 *Edelwood: zdravetz, cedar, spice*
A very woodsy, slightly sweet scent. The cedar takes the front while a delicate floral blooms in the background.  I liked this one a lot more than I thought I would, it's gentle and pretty.

🍎 *Winesap: apple, wine, patchouli*
Pineward, you've done it again. I love their Apple Tabac perfume and I love Winesap. This scent for some reason brought back the memory of a pull-apart fruit snack I used to have a s a kid, and I'm mad that I can't remember the name of it. VERY juicy apple with the wine coming through with the faintest bite of alcohol. I'm going to have to fight myself to make this sample last 😭

They want to get their shit and leave .i promise NOBODY cares about writing on their cup, they want their coffee quick so they can leave and go to work or take the kids to school or WHATEVER.



There's so many fucking rules and restrictions with this it's gotten comical. No hearts, no stars, no animals, no pop culture references, song lyrics, or memes, smiley faces are okay but ONLY if accompanied by a message, the message has to be individualized (whatever that means) 



How about just. NOT doing it. Nobody gives a fuck and it IS slowing is down. Managers all wanna say it doesn't take any time, are you stupid? Everything takes time. Unless you have some quantum entanglement between the sharpie and the cup, and you can write on every cup literally instantaneously as soon as you think it, YES IT TAKES EXTRA TIME. Even if it's 5 seconds, 5 seconds times 200 drinks is a LOT of wasted time. 



I want to be a smart ass so bad and make long ass literary messages, but someone will misinterpret that too. Guess what, ANYTHING can be misunderstood. That's what the word means. Sooooooo stupid.

But I never asked her out, just had some few chats online. She was a year senior than me but then I failed in my first year and the thought of asking her out went down to zero. I was so ashamed and embarrassed to even chat with her (because I failed and now she is two years senior than me). 

Once she graduated from college, I thought maybe just chat with her for one last time and tell her how I feel so that I can get a closure. I did, and I thought that was it. 

Occasionally I do try to chat her and she was a prompt replier and she was good, kind, and someone who maintains conversation. 

I then got a job in the same city as her, and I thought if I try this time, I could pull it off. I tried, we chatted, I frequently sent her message but that was it, nothing happened, nothing serious. She was a reader, and I tried to ask her to lend a book from her and she agreed, and we met for few seconds (that was the first time I had physical conversation with her). 

I thought in return, I would ask her for a coffee (once I finish reading), but she just dodged the topic. Wasn't interested to meet at all (she said, ""see you when I see you""). 

I got restless, felt alot of things I didn't know how to identify, and I then sent a long text saying how I have been into her for the past 6 years and now that I know this isn't possible I wanted to get a closure (another closure), I thought if I were to move on from her, I can only do that if I tell her how I feel (which btw she knows). I was so into her, that I got really depressed. She replied after a day, saying sorry about feeling this way, and she didn't intend any of this at all and some other bullshit of texts, and then I replied with much enthusiasm and...and that was it, she didn't reply anymore. 

Now when I think, she never texted me, she just replied to my messages. 

I thought this will pass if i don't see her (her posts and stories). I muted her, but regularly check her stories and post. I didn't get any closure, and now I my mind is convincing me that, if she marries or uploads a picture of her lover, than only I can move on. It's crazy, I try everything to forget her, but every damn scenarios, imaginations, I have to include her. She has become a part of my life and it's hurts me. 

I think this is mainly because I never chat with anyone, and people do not find me entertaining. I am not a good looking guy, and I can hardly talk. I have been lonely these past years, and nowadays I am at my loneliest. This is mainly due to old friends drifting apart, and my inability to make new ones and not able to chat or go out.

Maybe it was his face, his energy, or simply the way he carried himself — calm, composed, with a quiet confidence that stood out even in the background noise of the café.

My starter is currently on day 14 and has very little activity. There are some bubbles but only on the side and there is very little rise 7 hours after feeding. Yesterday (day 13) had similar growth as today. This all is the first activity since the (expected) growth at day 3. 

Some information about my starter:
- The feeding ratio is 1:1:1 all 50 grams with feeding once a day in the morning
- I use wheat flower (T65 at first, switched to T55 since the other bag was finished)
- I use lukewarm tapwater (here in the Netherlands, tapwater does not contain chlorine)
- The jar is cleaned every day
- The starter is standing on the coffee machine to keep the temperature nice and warm

Should I start to worry about my starter, change anything in my approach, or just keep going like I have been doing so far? I read everywhere that starters should be fully active between 8-14 days so that’s why I am a bit uncertain.

I'm (35M) looking for a part-time position some place local like coffee shops, restaurants, etc that are open 'late' so I can work there after my regular 8am to 5pm full-time job. But, every time I apply, I am getting rejected left and right for Barista, Server, Cashier, Service Team, etc positions. I know it's probably because of my resume lacking the ""necessary"" experience. I've been a Project Manager for the past 8 years and prior to that I was in a similar type of management role for two years. So my past 10 years of work experience probably isn't what these companies are looking for.

But how can I actually update my resume so it reflects the things that these companies want? The last time I worked at a retail location was in 2010 when I worked at Starbucks...

-what would be good pop up events to try to apply/ sign up for? Looking for somewhere smaller maybe that would approve us? They all seem so big and hard to get in. Also expensive!

-where to be able to put up fliers? Coffee shops, other art places, other businesses?

-are there any art businesses that sell local art that might be interested in taking some of our designs?

Survivor help was not allowed and I had to beat every boss while completing every case without restarting. 

It’s a bit hard to tell the tier list for the skill moves so here’s a text version-

S- Roundhouse Kick.

A- Jump Kick, Knee Drop, Double Lariat. 

B- Somersault Kick, Disembowel, Zombie Ride, Backhand Chop and Power Push.

C- Dodge Roll, Judo Throw, Power Kick, Lift Up, Face Smasher, Suplex.

D- Football Tackle, Hamer Throw, Giant Swing, Neck Snap. 



- This honestly wasn’t as bad as I initially anticipated, since I started with a level 50 Frank I could endure almost anything with a full supply of Orange Juice/Coffee Creamer and the health magazines, the real challenge was finding openings to attack and dealing with the time limit because some fights dragged on for far too long. 

- My favorite fight was definitely Kent despite of his difficulty in this run and my least favorite was Cletus because he clearly wasn’t designed to be fought unarmed. 

- I initially dreaded the Isabella fight because I didn’t think I’d even be able to hit her, but all it requires is a very precise Knee Drop to both damage her and iframe through the motorcycle. 

- I also managed to save 35 survivors and died only once to Kent.

- I honestly expected Bomb Collector to be impossible because I had zero clue if I’d be able to hit Carlito through the car but I did and he went down pretty easily.

I’m currently looking to upgrade from my Breville Prima Latte (milk system is broken :<). I’m considering the **Sage (Breville) Barista Touch Impress**, mainly because I want something with an integrated grinder and decent milk steaming capabilities. I usually drink 2 coffees per day, mostly milk-based drinks.

That said, I have a few concerns:

\- **Space is limited** – my depth restriction is **34 cm max**, so I need something compact.

\- I've seen **reports of reliability issues** with the Impress Touch, which worries me.

\- I'm wondering if there’s **anything else worth buying** in this price range (or lower) that fits the size constraint and still delivers great quality.

So, I (M19) have got these red spots and a bit of acne (which i had lot's of in my mid teenage) on my cheeks and on my forehead (mostly at the right side) and some visible pores that I really want to get rid of. I started skin care a year ago.
I’m also looking to detan my skin. My skin’s gotten darker or maybe just redder? Could be from all the handwalks I do to boost blood flow to my head 😝 (just kidding… kind of).

A little about me: I have oily skin and I’m usually outdoors doing workouts usually under a shade or at university and am about to begin my part-time corporate life too.
Note: In like last 6 months of 2024, I was mostly indoors and got highly untanned with just Cleansing, sometimes Vitamin C serum and multani mitti so I'm aware of that but now I simply cannot stay indoors.

Right now I’m using five products:

1. Bio-Aqua Rice Raw Pulp Cleanser – just started using this as my night face wash a couple of weeks ago. It has glycerin, Lauric acid, some sulfates and then some random chemicals.
2. Fair & Lovely Men’s Face Wash – I use this or the Bio Aqua face wash when my skin’s extra oily and I need to remove sunblock at night. It also has similar ingredients to that of the above cleanser.
3. Jade’s Vitamin C & Papaya Extract Face Wash – I use this every morning for a refreshing start.
4. Retinol + Niacinamide + Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer – I apply this three times a week after shaving and my face feels super smooth (I’m still new to it).
5. 100 SPF Sunblock – I layer this over the moisturizer or I use it solo whenever I skip the moisturizer. Previously I was using Vince’s 40 SPF with zinc.

For nights, I’ve been using Jaysuing’s 5 in 1 Facial Serum (10% Hyaluronic acid, 5% Niacinamide, 30% Vitamin C, 10% Vitamin E and 5% Collagen) for about three weeks now and I apply that almost every night and it feels smooth too but I wake up with a very oily face in the morning.

I’ve also tried a homemade anti-tan pack (coffee, chickpea flour, honey, yogurt), but I noticed it leaves my skin a bit yellowish/orangish. I’ve got a Vitamin C cleanser and a turmeric + Vitamin C firming cream on deck but I haven’t tried those out yet.

So here’s my real question: based on all this, how can I improve my skincare routine and get rid of the tan? Any product swaps, extra steps or tips you’ve found life changing? Thanks in advance! 😊

1lkau15,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1lkau15/review_grand_velas_los_cabos/,Review: Grand Velas Los Cabos,"Just returned from a big family trip to Cabo and thought others may benefit from hearing about our experience at this popular property! 

**Where we went**: *Grand Velas Los Cabos* 

**When we went**: *June*

**Who went**: *Multigenerational family ranging from 19 months to 75 years old*

**Pictures of the property**: *Turns out I only take pictures of my son now, sooo... sorry!* 

**Service**: *8*

* The strongest asset here, by far, is the fantastic staff. Everyone was professional, courteous, friendly, and very helpful. Our personal concierge was always responsive and helped us manage various requests. 
* Service around the pool was good, though sometimes we would have to go find an attendant to place our order. Food and drinks were always delivered quickly, and every attendant was so kind and friendly. 
* Before our arrival, the process of arranging dinner reservations was incredibly painful. They initially could not accommodate any of our desired times. After a long back and forth, they helped us get the times we wanted, but it was a lengthy process. And weirdly many of the restaurants were half-empty when we sat down, so it's a little strange that this was so difficult. 
* Additionally, while we had requested and confirmed a car seat for transportation from the airport to the hotel (and it was listed on our reservation), there was no car seat for our 1.5 year old son upon pick up from the airport.

**Property**: *8*

* The property was beautiful, and the pools were great. There are three huge, terraced pools: two for families and one for adults only. The two family pools were beautiful and had plenty of chairs around each one. The pool was definitely busy at times, but it never felt too crowded. There's a lot of room to spread out.
* There were a lot of stairs around the pool area, which could be tough for those with limited mobility. 
* One gripe for summer months is that the only places to hang out were by the pools and a few tables around the lobby. There were not many air conditioned or even well-shaded spaces besides your own room, the buffet restaurant (Azul), and the gym (which was very nice by the way). 
* There is a small playground, although it is more geared towards 3 years and older, and it is located at the top of a hill. 
* The splash pad and wading pool were sadly located away from the pools and had no shade at all. We only went once despite the fact that our son loves splash pads, and we rarely saw anyone in that area. 

**Rooms**: *7*

* We booked the Ambassador Suite Ocean View for 4 nights. The room was spacious and clean, if a little dated. Also note that it’s a junior suite format with no separation between the living and sleeping areas. The bed was comfortable, and the AC worked great, although it did feel a bit damp in the room. The big balcony was great for hanging out. 
* One drawback was that we could easily hear our neighbors in the adjoining room through the connecting door, and the noise from the outdoor corridor was easily audible through our door. We had our toddler with us, and luckily he is a heavy sleeper. However, if you have a light sleeper in your group, you may want to ask for a room at the end of the hotel. 

**Food**: *8*

* Breakfast and lunch are served at Azul, their buffet. It's open from 7-11:30am for breakfast, closes briefly from 11:30am-12pm to reset, and opens again from 12-5pm for lunch. The breakfast and lunch options were decent and did change from day to day, which was nice. I feel like most folks can find something here that speaks to them. Unfortunately this restaurant has a bird problem, so don’t be surprised if you see bird droppings. 
* While breakfast and lunch were fine, the food was definitely better at the dinner restaurants. Frida (Mexican) had excellent food that was flavorful and interesting, and Loto (at their sister boutique adults only property) was also delicious and definitely worth trying! We also tried Velas 10 (steak and seafood) and Lucca (Italian/Mediterranean), both of which were pretty good. 
* There is also a coffee bar open from 6am-9pm that has a great selection of coffee drinks, smoothies, and small snacks. This was super helpful, and we utilized it a lot for coffee and snacks for our son. 
* Bottom-line: the food is solid for an all-inclusive, and it will occasionally impress you. Just don't expect to be blown away by every meal. 

**Extras & activities**: *8*

* For us, the pool was enough to keep us occupied for 3 full days. It was fun to walk on the beach as well, but note this is not a swimmable beach (though Chileno Bay is just south of here). 
* There are some games in one of the pavilions (table tennis and cornhole) and a volleyball net in one of the pools. They also have a bunch of activities and events throughout the day if you want to do something other than veg by the pool. 
* The gym is excellent, with plenty of weights and cardio equipment. 

**Other notable stuff:**

* Total cost for 4 nights (2 adults + toddler) was around $5800. 
* They provide cribs, strollers, diaper pails, and high chairs. 
* When we sat down to dinner, most waiters immediately provided the kids menu and got that food going ASAP. This was awesome and much appreciated. 
* They ""provide sunblock"" at the pool, but it's like 1-2 pump bottles for the entire pool complex, so definitely bring your own. 
* Cabo in the summer is nice, despite the heat, but our stay back in November was much more enjoyable (amazing weather + so many whales). 

I am also accepting recommendations for the next multigen trip: summer 2026 with fly fishing + amazing pool. :) ",13,1750870086.0,chubbytravel,5,1.0,False

At school today I was trying to get lunch with another student and the staff member that’s running the canteen said “We don’t have lunch for these guys” and i said “You just made me uncomfortable!”. We were arguing in the corridor about why she shouldn’t use it, but she thought I said “misjudging” and just walked off to the place she was been. 
I talked to another staff member that came from the canteen about it, and why it offends me, and she said something like, “It’s a mixed group term. She didn’t mean it literally, but I can see why you think it’s offending you”. 
I get her point but it still counts as misgendering, because you’re basically calling a mixed-gender group “guys”, which is either a term for a mixed group (as in “Guys, let’s get coffee” or “You guys have to see this!”, but using “these guys”, “those guys”, “the guys” etc. to refer to a mixed gender group is completely misgendering. Do people not realize this?), or for males (“The guys are looking handsome recently, did they go to the barbers”).
What I’m trying to say was, the phrase in this context referred to a mixed group, and there was me (a girl) and a boy in the room trying to get our lunches. Misgendering is when you use the wrong pronouns for a person, or in this case, refer to a gender(s) by a different gendered word or phrase, like for example, calling a girl a boy because she has VERY short hair and wears tomboyish clothing. A lot of people, especially those that use they/them, do get offended by it because they don’t use pronouns like she/her or he/him anymore after they change, because, for some, they feel like those pronouns aren’t really comfortable for them anymore, or they just like to be called they/them, alongside MANY other reasons. Sometimes, misgendering can be used for a joke, such as, “She needs to have a bra on, her boobs are saggy” when a man thinks he has a bigger chest than any other man. 
But EVEN for that, they can still get offended; they don’t like it and think the man is upset and hurt by the comment about his chest, and needs to HIDE it.
I’ve got a little carried away with the examples, but that is why “these guys” SHOULD NOT BE SAID to refer to a mixed gender group; people like me can get offended or even uncomfortable.",0,1750870045.0,teenagers,8,0.33,False
1lkasuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleepnumber/comments/1lkasuv/disappointing_customer_service/,Disappointing Customer Service,"All of the poor reviews of Sleep Number Mattresses have responses from Sleep Number advising disgruntled customers to simply call customer service to resolve their issues, but I am here to tell you (spoiler alert), they don’t really care. \*My goal is to inform your mattress purchase decision, so if you’d like to skip my backstory, just find the \* below for the CliffsNotes. 

I bought my Sleep Number mattress in 2019, and if I had rated it at that time, I also would have given it 5 stars. My husband and I made this investment after significant research, as we were both having back and joint issues. During the time that the mattress was fully functional, it did relieve our back pain (after a few months spent discovering our ideal ""sleep numbers""), and I liked that I could tilt the head up to read in bed-bonus. About a year ago (5 years into the life of the mattress) my side of the mattress kept ""deflating,"" and I would have to re-inflate throughout the night. I called Sleep Number and spoke to a wonderful customer service agent who was very sympathetic to my situation, but was only at liberty to send me a YouTube Video and guide me in purchasing parts to help me **troubleshoot the issue** ***myself.*** I just want to emphasize this part because I paid over $5,000 for a mattress, it was defective after 5 years, and Sleep Number’s solution is to charge me to see if I can diagnose the problem myself. 

Fast forward one year (because I work full time, have 3 active children and *literally* did not have the time, sanity or peace and quiet to call customer service Monday-Friday between 8 and 4:30- oh, and now on Saturday mornings!), I have managed to diagnose the problem after purchasing test parts, watching multiple YouTube videos, and spending countless hours under my bed like an auto mechanic (nothing against auto mechanics, it’s just not for me. Back issues). I called Sleep Number back, and they congratulated me on diagnosing the problem and said with my “prorated warranty” the air chamber (my diagnosed issue) would ONLY cost me $163.20 (oh, and here’s a YouTube video to help you install it- get your skateboard back out). I simply asked if (perhaps), would they (kindly) consider giving me the price of what it would have cost *last* summer, had I managed to diagnose the problem in the time I had allotted then. I was transferred to a “manager” upgrading me to a “Karen.” Great. I relayed my saga to the new guy, asking again if we could just pretend that it was last year, and that I had nothing but time to call, receive part, watch video, test, repeat, to which he replied, “no, ma’am, that is not how a prorated warranty works (you idiot), that’ll be $163.20.”(Sighs. Gets credit card). He confirmed that this is a common problem, and wouldn’t give me his name for safety purposes (smart move, Jack). 

\*Long story short, what I wish 2019 me knew: your outrageously expensive glorified air mattress *will* have issues (confirmed by customer service), you will have to pay EVEN MORE out of pocket for parts (regardless of warranty), and you will have to either pay $200 per visit for a specialist to diagnose and subsequently fix your mattress, or become a mattress specialist yourself in order to diagnose and fix your mattress (a proud title I now carry- maybe they’ll give me a job?). 

Positives: The mattress was a dream for the first 4 years (oh, but the app was not reliable). The *first* customer service agents were always very kind, sympathetic, friendly and helpful. The parts did always come in quickly, and they did cover the cost of shipping (put that eight bucks toward an overpriced coffee).

Commune de Paris, France

Dear William,

It has been such a long time since I have contacted you. I hope you find this letter in good health and spirits. I wish the same for your little ones and family. I suppose I must end the pleasantries, my dear friend. I must say, it has been quite a time living here in France for the past week. The country is not much different, yet so much more from what it was.

I imagine you’re reading this under a lamp flickering over the subway tracks at Union Square, your third coffee of the day cooling by your elbow, as another deadline passes unnoticed. I envy you. And I don’t.

You asked me, half-jokingly over oysters, why anyone would want to go to France anymore. “To drink wine with ghosts?” you said. Well, Will—this France has changed. Drastically. And as I sit now beneath the vaulted glass of Gare d’Austerlitz, watching the quiet ballet of trains and people, I must confess: I don’t fully understand what I’ve stepped into. But it’s unlike anything I’ve known.

Let me take it from the beginning.

The flight from JFK touched down at Orly on a gray, drizzling morning. The customs line was orderly. Not rigid—but composed, almost like the people had come to an agreement among themselves on how to wait. There were no luxury lounges or glowing billboards peddling perfume or watches. Instead, there were murals. Enormous, modernist murals: one showed rows of harvesters walking behind tractors, “For each according to their ability, to each according to work,” read the caption in French. It was both unsettling and beautiful.

I wasn’t asked for a visa in the traditional sense. I was given a temporary visitor card, stamped with an insignia of the commune. Currency here doesn’t exchange hands, because there *is* no currency in the old sense. Instead, people carry labor vouchers: single-use, non-transferable credits linked to the labor hours they contribute to society. I received a matte black card with a pin number similar to a debit card which ought to work as my means of exchange.

I was met at the gate by a liaison from the Ministry of Cultural Exchange—a soft-spoken woman named Anouk, maybe forty, who offered me black coffee in a thermos and a bus pass that worked on all inter-city lines. She handed me a thin slate no bigger than a postcard, which updates with my appointments, recommended reading, and an outline of how the nation’s economy works.

“It helps if you read a little,” she said, “before you interpret too much.”

The streets of Paris no longer roar. They hum. You hear the thrum of trams and the soft hiss of bicycles more than car horns. I passed Avenue de la République and saw a building with a neon sign that “Maison d’Alimentation”—a community-run café where workers come with their vouchers to eat, talk, and leave without money changing hands.

There’s no tipping here. No prices, either, on most basic goods. I asked Anouk how they determine what to stock. She said, simply, “We ask.” The entire country's economy operates on a feedback model. Consumption is tracked not to profit from you, but to adjust production dynamically. Citizens' report needs and preferences, which are compiled into the national plan through a system based on the **Input-Output model**.

Now, I remember you covered a bit of economics in school, so here’s the rough sketch they gave me: imagine every sector of the economy as a node in a matrix. What they consume from others and what they produce are all accounted for. Every week-yes, *week*, not year-the system recalculates the optimal output vector based on supply, demand, and resource availability. A kind of dynamic feedback loop.

The Ministry doesn’t *control* production in the command-and-control sense. Instead, it nudges it. Much like a gardener tends without strangling. When there's scarcity, vouchers are harder to redeem in that sector, signaling the need for greater labor input. When there's surplus, incentives decrease. Wages aren’t fixed; they're weighted by labor demand and scarcity.

Much of the control is with the producers themselves, the country's economy is run by syndicates- a federation of unions in the same industry which decide on production and as the commands filter down they're adjusted to meet the local needs and the capacity of production. So, each of the industries decides for itself how to produce, how, and where. Each of them form contracts with each other and that decides the interdependencies of the industries in the economy. Which is fed to the bureau of planning, which plans the economy

I walked through a housing block in the 11th arrondissement where every family has a unit—spacious, bright, state-owned but individually maintained. There’s no rent. Only a time-based obligation to communal maintenance. If you don’t clean the stairwell for one month, you may be asked to take up recycling next. It’s... democratic, but eerie in how smooth it all runs. Not because of fear, but because it seems people *believe* in it. Or perhaps, fear has been replaced by another sort of social pressure: visibility.

Everyone’s hours worked and services rendered are visible in the ledger. Not what they consume—but what they contribute. It’s not coercive, Anouk insisted. But it is transparent. A man loafing about too long, she said, wouldn’t be punished. But he might be visited by a local delegate to “talk about health, purpose, and social integration.”

The children here are curious. In a park near Place des Vosges, a group of them were making a scale model of a wind turbine. Not for a grade. Not for a competition. Just... because it was part of their science day. They spoke about “energy units” like they were talking about Pokémon cards.

And here’s the kicker: education here doesn’t end at 18 or 22. It’s continuous. People can, and do, re-train through the ""Pathways Bureau"" to work in different sectors as their lives change. An ex-steelworker can become a nurse. A teacher can retrain in agriculture. The system absorbs the cost, on the logic that an adaptable society is a resilient one.

What I don’t yet understand, Will, is *how they keep it all afloat*. There is no stock market. No private capital in the conventional sense. Instead, long-term investments are decided based on collective votes from sectoral assemblies, which estimate future needs using simulations fed by the planning model.

Each Quarter, the National Confederation of Syndicates meets. They decide on what is to be done, where progress has been made, and make target productions or adjust targets based on how the production is happening. They also discuss the needs of the nation as a whole, re-elect an executive committee if the last one is voted out and so on. In sense they are the legislative of the government, as well as an executive during session time, but during recess time, the executive committee is the executive of the ""state"".

I haven’t seen homelessness. Not because the poor are hidden, but because they’re... housed. Food, shelter, healthcare—those are socialized. Not tied to vouchers. The idea is that basic dignity should not be earned. Only the luxuries—imported wines, tailored clothes, art equipment—are gated behind vouchers. And even then, barely.

Am I being shown the surface? Undoubtedly. But I can already sense tensions beneath. There's talk of the ""Wage Question""—whether differentials in labor time are causing new forms of class distinction. There are debates about whether café musicians should be credited equally with factory technicians. One person told me there was a brief strike by childcare workers demanding higher scarcity weights in the national ledger. They won. Quietly. Through deliberation, not picket lines. Ironic that the unions are becoming like bureaucrats now, they talk rather than making decisions.

But I’ll save those stories for the next letter. For now, know this: the world I’ve entered is not utopia. But it *is* different. Boldly, radically so. And in a time when the old systems feel as if they’re cracking under their contradictions, that difference feels like the future—A different world, still imperfect, still filled with problems, but it's growing better. But as they've said in the past, when France sneezes, the whole of Europe catches a cold, so maybe it'll spread all over the country.

Yours,

She is very conventionally attractive and I noticed it as soon as I met her, but I only started developing feelings for her a few months ago, after I left her country, improved my own mental health and self-confidence and got to know her personality a lot better. She's philosophical, direct and open, so I've been able to ask her everything about herself I could possibly want to know, and I found out that at heart we both want long-term relationships and also see love in very similar terms. Right now we live several countries away, but I'm likely to be much closer to her after this fall.

We've been flirting quite a bit recently, which is unusual for me since I have very little experience; I've complimented her features, her personality (which I don't think she hears much about from men) and even her body in certain photos, because she's made me feel comfortable enough to do so, and practically everything I've written has been received positively. I have already confessed that I have some interest in her and haven't been rejected, but she's told me that there's at least one other person (maybe two?) in the picture. I am coming to visit her in a month's time, and we'll be spending at least several hours together, perhaps even as much as a day and a half. We've even talked a little about sex and I would like to sleep with her if she is open to it, but as I said above, what I really want is a long-term relationship with her.

I've already planned to get her a book (a different kind of gift than others might give) and we're planning some things to do soon, but what's the best way to act in the situation considering she's a person who likes confidence and typically masculine traits? Should I come on more strongly right away and show my interest with my body language/light touch, or should I gradually build things up as we meet? I do plan to tell her fully how I see something long-term with her, which it seems the other people in the picture haven't really expressed; I'm just not sure about the best way to get there.",2,1750869186.0,Advice,0,0.75,False

But, there is an Information Age going on right now throughout sports where Jordan Schultz is fighting Ian Rapaport in a Starbucks because, uh, they don't like each other, and Schultz is now being accused by other information guys of buying his way into the game by sending executives coffee from his father, Starbucks owner who used to own the SuperSonics.  

An interesting career choice, by the way, when your father is the owner of Starbucks and the SuperSonics, to choose the Information Age

-brief banter with Billy and Zas-

The repeater, the information guys are really valuable, okay, I wanna talk about Jordan Schultz in a second because what's happening with him is funny, the other, he's being accused by other information guys as being, doing to the information game what LIV, what the Saudis have done to LIV golf, uh, where they buy their way into the game and now he's got player relationships the way Jay Glazer used to have player relationships and most of the insiders don't have the player relationships, they have the executive relationships, and, so, he's playing a different game, 

but when Amin mentions the repeater tax, the thing that I wanted to ask you guys is Pablo Torre has a report, uh, that is, uh, the sixth headline on a slow news day on ESPNEWS, he's got big breaking news, but it's about labor, the NFL Players Union, and what would pass for something very close to the dirty insides of collusion.  Doesn't quite get there, but it shows you how it is the owners tried to  keep the money down.  These greedy owners in that sport, by basically colluding, even though and arbiter ruled that they did not collude, and the media has covered it very poorly, and Mike Florio is yelling and screaming about this and I'm curious whether you guys are interested in this part of it at all.

Mike Florio is saying it's not being covered because everyone is a league partner. And so it's not gonna be covered 

And so it finally go onto the ESPN homepage, as I said the sixth, uh, the sixth story, but all day yesterday, this was not talked about by the league partners and I'm just curious, I'm asking you this because I remember these conversations when we left ESPN and how insistent I was to the people who were doing our negotiating, 'hey, be careful about partnering us with anybody who's NFL adjacent cuz they're gonna be trying to control stuff we're saying around here and how we say it and when we say it.  

And the NFL has become so powerful right now, okay, because Ian Rapaport is an NFL employee, okay, he's an information guy, paid for by the NFL, the NFL has become so powerful that it's coming very close to being able to control the news, like, not totally, but more than most people can, and I'm just curious, do any of you care, because the insides of that story, and you can check it out at Pablo Torre Finds Out, the insides of that story will show you how dirty this business is, how greedy the people are, and how that power is at the very top of that sport in a way that's very well concealed.

Florio and Pablo Torre were trying to get these documents, and, uh, Torre got em first, but what do you make of Florios criticism that league partners in business with the NFL have to do things like this?

I will tell you, uh, that John Skipper, former CEO of our company has the story of when this partnership with the NFL was with PBS and reporting about the NFLs concussion problem, you got ESPN doing business and journalism, those things have to be different, they have to be separated, but ESPN managed it for many, many years, all of the conflicts in the business, but as the story climbed on concussions, that story got to Skipper and Skippers like 'okay, we're out on concussions.  We gotta get out on concussions, this has climbed too high, I'm the conflict of interest, I at the top of the company have to decide are we doing business or are we doing journalism. 

 And then, all is a sudden concussion coverage, the way it was being covered at the time that it was groundbreaking, Amin, like it was, it was PBS or was it NPR, it was one of, uh, it was a report that was showing the insides of brain trauma and the journalism department had to get out on that when the conflict reached where the business was, and so I ask you, as I present you this story of collusion, and the way that people love theses contract management, information stories....""why isn't this a bigger story?""

Amin:  ""the, the, Florio story or the, the Celtics repeater?""

Dan:  The Celtics repeater I don't want to talk about anymore.  Why would you think I was asking you about the Celtics repeater?""

Hey everyone,
Been thinking a lot lately about connection, and how rare it feels to genuinely find people who are on the same wavelength. I'm 31, and I'm really just looking to make some new friends who crave the kind of conversations that stretch beyond the surface... the ones where you feel like you're unearthing something real and resonant.
Empathy and authenticity are huge for me. I’m not really into small talk; I'd much rather dive into what truly makes your soul sing, what makes you curious about the world, or even just the quiet moments that hold profound meaning. It's about building a space where we can truly listen and be heard, you know?
Full disclosure: I tend to connect more easily and deeply with women. There’s just often a different kind of conversational flow and understanding that I find myself drawn to. It's not about anything romantic, purely about finding that rich, genuine friendship where thoughts can wander and ideas can really take root.
If you're also feeling that pull towards deeper connections, if you appreciate someone who's genuinely interested in your perspective and who values a good, thoughtful chat over everything else, then I'd love to hear from you. Maybe we could grab a coffee, go for a walk, or just chat online to see if our vibes align.
Looking forward to potentially finding some kindred spirits out there...

- The ending of all the videos is the same always, credits roll while we see the main character (the ny dude) sitting in the NY subway with other people. 

- the other video I saw I remember less but it is the one I want to remember the most (because I recently lost the love of my life) it’s a video of the same guy I think remembering his ex in flashing images but the particularity is that he remembers her not in like the “big romantic” moments like first kiss or whatever, but like in the “mundane” things like the time she farted and they laughed for hours, or when they got lost in a travel or things like that.

**Why This Pick?**

 My brain sees Jack Flaherty’s (3.74 ERA) name on the starting list and immediately thinks “Over”, friends. Far and away one of Detroit’s weaker starters, Flaherty has allowed 15 runs over his last two outings. On the other side, Athletics starter Jacob Lopez (4.25 ERA) had a solid encounter against the Kansas City Royals his last time out, but typically, his Away ERA sits at a whopping 6.92. I expect the As to get a number of runs past Flaherty this evening, and the Tigers offense to have little issue with Lopez. Take the Over to cash.

Had several tests done back then but was never diagnosed or prescribed anything. These days my BP typically stays in the 125-135 / 75-85 range. I’m 37, active, BMI 23.7, non-smoker, rarely drink, cholesterol 219.

On Juneteenth, I took Unisom (over the counter sleep aid which my wife takes regularly, for the first time ever) at 1am after two bad nights of sleep. Woke up at 4am drenched in sweat, HR 122, BP 190/107. It dropped to 169/99 within 30 minutes. By the time I got to urgent care around 9am, BP was 130/76 and EKG looked normal. No referral was given.

The day before: minimal sleep (I haven’t measured BP), 2 cups of coffee instead of 1, leftover pizza for lunch so maybe a perfect storm?

Only other incident: I fainted once the day after my 2nd COVID vaccine in 2021. No other fainting episodes.

Annual checkup’s in August, and I’d like to be prepared on what to ask for, what tests to request, and what might’ve caused that spike. Definitely not taking Unisom going forward.

Would love to hear if anyone had something similar or has any advice?

TL;DR: 37M, borderline BP. Took Unisom after poor sleep, woke up with BP 190/107 & HR 122. Dropped on its own, EKG normal. Trying to figure out next steps.",1,1750868470.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
